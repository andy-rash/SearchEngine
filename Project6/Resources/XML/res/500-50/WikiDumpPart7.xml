Written Records and Archaeology 

Until the late 19th century most of the information about pre-Hellenistic Eastern Mediterranean came from the Hebrew Bible and from various Greek and Latin sources.

While the Hebrew Bible was largely completed by 300 BC, its attitude toward contemporary religions of the area was generally quite hostile, so that its references to these religions may not only devalue them but also exaggerate or distort various aspects of them. On the other hand, Israelite religion was itself an outgrowth of, as well as a reaction to, the religions of its neighbours, so that many features of Israelite religion found in the Hebrew Bible exemplify the religions of the larger area. The only sure guide to making such discriminations is the knowledge gained from indigenous documents.

Greek and Latin sources may be less hostile, but they are also much later, from the Roman period. While they may be more reliable in their description of the contemporary character of the religions of the area, that character may have been significantly different after several centuries of Hellenism from what it had been even in the middle of the preceding millennium. Notable among the Greek and Latin sources are De Dea Syra (&quot;About the Syrian Goddess&quot;) from the 2nd century AD, attributed to Lucian of Samosata, and the section of Eusebius of Caesarea's Praeparatio evangelica (&quot;Preparation for the Gospel&quot;; 4th century AD) that cites extracts from a History of Phoenicia by Philo of Byblos (c. AD 100); Philo himself claimed to be translating the work of an early Phoenician priest, Sanchuniathon. While indigenous sources now confirm isolated elements of this allegedly early description of Phoenician religion, its distortions also have become more demonstrable. Philo's history is in fact an attempt to recount early Phoenician history by constructing a systematic chronological sequence of events out of the various local traditions of his time and interpreting the latter euhemeristically -- that is, by treating gods and myths as representative of historical individuals and events.

Beginning in the late 18th century, the finds of early explorers of the area and subsequently of archaeologists engaged in more systematic excavation have produced a rapidly increasing number of firsthand sources. Successive generations of epigraphers and philologists have deciphered the texts and attained an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the languages. Unfortunately, the texts that are best understood tend to be formulaic and yield only the most external kinds of information about the religion, while the more distinctive texts, which seem more interesting and promise to be more revealing, are usually more difficult to penetrate.

Cuneiform archives from various 2nd-millennium sites and from the 3rd millennium at Ebla in northwestern Syria provide some documentation of the religion. The most abundant documentation comes from the 14th- and 13th-century remains of the city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra), on the Mediterranean coast of Syria. This includes the only native examples of extended religious narrative. It also comprises the widest range of genres, including myths, legends, liturgical texts, god lists, omens, and correspondence.

From the 1st millennium come scores of Phoenician inscriptions, both from the Phoenician coast and from other areas of the eastern Mediterranean; neo-Hittite hieroglyphic inscriptions and Aramaic inscriptions from northern Syria, almost all from the 9th and 8th centuries; and Moabite, Ammonite, and Hebrew inscriptions. These are very limited in genre, and relatively few are more than a few lines long.

Uninscribed materials from excavated sites throughout the eastern Mediterranean supplement the picture: they include the foundations of temples, temple furnishings, figurines, images of gods and their emblems, and scenes of gods, myths, and religious activities on reliefs and seals. However, criteria for identifying religious materials have not always been carefully considered, nor has discriminating attention been given to the question of the reflection of religious life in material remains in general. It is often difficult to correlate with confidence written and unwritten materials.

In spite of these new and ever-growing sources of knowledge, the resulting picture is still very irregular. While there is an unparalleled variety of sources, covering a century and a half, from the large cosmopolitan city of Ugarit, other written materials give a much more limited picture. For many periods, areas, and topics there are no written remains. Descriptions of the religion of any one period or area (with the exception of Ugarit) are extremely limited and superficial. Generalizations about the religions of the eastern Mediterranean may well prove to have significant exceptions as some of these gaps are filled by new discoveries.</text>

Trade, faith, slavery and war with the Greeks and the Romans

A bronze coin of Carthage 3rd century B.C. called a &quot;zar&quot;  

Trade is part of the story
The Carthaginian empire had a very diversified and complex economy. They relied heavily on trade, but this is only a part of the story. 

Like their Phoenician cousins, they produced the much prized purple dye so coveted by royalty, from the crushed shells of a saltwater snail species called Murex. Their trading ships called at every port of antiquity, and they traded overland with peoples of the interior of Africa, such as the Garamantes, Berbers, Numidians, Mauretanians and Ethiopians, and possibly with the mysterious Nok culture of central Africa. From the interior they obtained salt, which was highly prized in ancient times, the exchange rate being equal to gold. Roman soldiers (and probably Carthaginians too) were paid in part in salt, from which comes the old saying &quot;worth your salt&quot;. Carthage had excellent relations with the warlike Gauls, Celts, and Celtiberians, from whom they obtained amber, tin, silver, and furs. Their merchant vessels (often capable of transporting 100 tons or more, a size not reached by European ships until the fifteenth century A.D.) brought exotic goods from faraway lands such as spices like cinnamon, cassia (a Chinese type of cinnamon, much stronger) sesame seeds, frankincense, myrrh, ebony wood, ivory, and metals such as copper, lead, and gold. There is evidence that Carthaginian and Phoenician vessels were sailing at least as far as Sumatra in southeast Asia, which may be the &quot;mythical&quot; land of Punt, and were credited with having circumnavigated Africa soon after the Phoenician expedition sent by the Egyptian pharoah Necho in the seventh century B.C. 

The secret of how to make the purple dye was not the only trade that Carthaginians learned from their Tyrian motherland, they also learned how to make glass. The glassware produced by Carthage and Tyre, in a surprising variety of colors (even in swirls of rainbow colors), was highly prized through the ancient world. Their glass beads were traded for metals and other goods with more uncivilized cultures, and they are found in many ancient sites. 

Carthaginian traders brought amber from northern Europe and other gems to trade in Mediterranean ports. One type even came to be called after them (Carchedon). From their own homeland of Zeugitana (which nearly matches the borders of modern Tunisia) they brought wine, grain, fruits and nuts to trade, and dried fish from the Atlantic, as well as the products traded by their competitors the Greeks, such as olive oil. They also were famous for the quality of their furniture, beds and bedding, their wood joinery being widely copied. They brought furs from the barbaric lands and sold cheap pottery to nearly every people they traded with. The big surprise product only recently discovered, was marijuana, which was found in the wrecks of several Carthaginian ships. 

Punic Faith and Slavery
The Carthaginians are credited with inventing sale by auction, and they were famous for it. They even traded with people with whom they had no real contact, as described by Herodotus of Halicarnassus (about 430 B.C.) 

&quot;The Carthaginians also say they trade with a race of men who live in a part of Libya (Africa) beyond the Pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar). On reaching this country, they unload their goods, arrange them tidily along the beach, and then, returning to their boats, raise a smoke. Seeing the smoke, the natives come down to the beach, place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods, and go off again to a distance. The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold; if they think it represents a fair price for their wares, they collect it and go away; if, on the other hand, it seems too little, they go back aboard and wait, and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied. There is perfect honesty on both sides; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale, and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away.&quot; 

This description of &quot;perfect honesty&quot; on the part of Carthaginians may surprise some, since the enemies of Carthage (the Romans and Greeks) described them as cheats and liars; even today you can find in the dictionary &quot;punic faith&quot; as meaning dishonesty, yet there is little evidence that they were dishonest in trade. Common sense dictates that they could not have traded long if they were dishonest as a common practice. 

The intransigence on the part of some natives to trade with Carthaginians in person may be related to their Tyrian cousins making slave raids. The Carthaginians certainly had slaves, as well, but apparently did not go on slaving expeditions, at least not after about 500 B.C., as testified in their first treaty with Rome, which mentions coastal raids. 

 
Reverse of silver tetradrachm of Carthage, struck for use in paying mercenary soldiers in Sicily  
Warfare in ancient times was a different affair from today, and was seen as an important source of booty and slaves. Captured enemy soldiers might be ransomed back to their homeland or even exchanged, the going rate being two &quot;mina&quot; (a mina was equal to 50 shekels, or about 0.944 pound) in silver per soldier - (which is the price Hannibal demanded for the captives taken at Cannae) but if their homeland refused to pay or could not, they might be sold into slavery. One of the earliest accounts of a naval battle records the fate of the sailors of Phocaia taken captive by Carthage and her Tyrrhenian (Etruscan) allies - the Tyrrhenians killed their share of prisoners by stoning, while Carthage sold their own share into slavery. Enemy people too could be taken as slaves and sold, especially in the case of the taking of a city that did not surrender right away. 

At War with Greeks and Romans 
The trading pattern of Carthage in her early history was oriented toward the eastern Mediterranean, where she found ready markets for the raw materials brought from Africa and the Iberian peninsula. The famous city of Tartessus (Tarshish of the Old Testament) located on the Atlantic coast of Iberia was a great competitor for Carthage, and in concert with her Celt allies Carthage destroyed the famous city and took over the lucrative trade in the Atlantic seaboard. When the homeland (Phoenicia proper) fell to invaders, Carthage took advantage of the situation and expanded her trade, as well as taking control of the now isolated sister colonies such as Utica, Agadir (Gades, modern Cadiz) and Tingis, even though many had been established longer, and in some cases re-established colonies where Tyrian colonies had failed, such as those planted on the Atlantic coast of Africa by Hanno (about 510 B.C.) Carthage may have been saved from conquest by her mother city of Tyre. When the Persian Great King, having conquered Tyre, decided to extend his conquest to include Carthage, he 'drafted' the Tyrian fleet to do the job. The people of Tyre refused to sail against their children. Later on, Carthage and Persia entered into an agreement, with Carthage sending a token tribute annually. By the time Xerxes invaded Greece, the two were allies, and Carthage launched a huge army against Syracuse, resulting in the disastrous defeat at Himera in 480 B.C. at the hands of the Syracusans. 

The wars with the western Greeks hindered trade with the eastern Mediterranean ports, but Carthage found ready markets in the west, and kept a stranglehold on the Pillars of Hercules, with her warships having standing orders to sink any foreign vessel they found outside on sight. The port city of Massilia, (modern Marseilles, France) a colony of Greeks that contested with Carthage repeatedly, took advantage of the situation (the war with Syracuse tying down most of the Carthaginian fleet) and sent off Pytheas to discover the source of tin, a metal needed for the production of bronze. Pytheas managed to slip past the Carthaginians and found the source, the &quot;tin islands&quot; which are the British isles. After the accession of Alexander the Great, Carthage renewed trade with the eastern Mediterranean ports, and this influence can be seen in her artwork, pottery, and in their religious practices, adopting several Greek gods.

The wars with the Greeks finally ended with Carthage largely successful, and in control of most of western Sicily, all of Sardinia and Corsica as well as many smaller islands including Malta. Sicily was to be the cause of the first war with Rome, with whom Carthage had friendly relations up til that time, even allying with Rome against King Pyrrhus of Epirus. Polybius, a Greek historian of the second century B.C., stated that the Romans broke their treaty with Carthage and sent troops to Sicily in great part due to greed, the tantalizing idea of bringing the riches of Carthage to Rome was a tremendous enticement. 

Carthage was fairly advanced in agriculture and was a net exporter of grains, and famous for her horses, which strongly resemble the Arabian horses of today. Mago wrote a 28 volume treatise on agriculture and soil conservation, which was so highly valued by the Romans that they ordered it translated into Latin for their own use after the fall of Carthage in 146 B.C. They practiced irrigation and crop rotation, possibly learned from their contacts with Egypt and other near eastern countries. After the disastrous loss of the Second Punic war with Rome (202 B.C.), Hannibal was elected Shophet (or Suffete, a post very similar to the Judge-Kings of Israel), and pushed through a number of government reforms, and placed renewed emphasis on agriculture which was highly successful, allowing Carthage to pay her heavy war indemnity to Rome and recover her wealth, in spite of the loss of her empire. Legend has it that the Romans went so far as to salt the earth of Carthage after her utter destruction to prevent her rising again.</text>

==&lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;Accusative Case&lt;/font&gt;==

As you know from the [[../Introduction|introduction]], in German, there are four cases. Three are used often. The first, &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''Nominative Case'''&lt;/font&gt;, you learned in [[../Wie heißt du?#Nominative Case|Lesson 1]]. It covers the [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]], and the predicate noun (in &quot;He is (noun).&quot;, (noun) is the predicate noun). The second, the &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''Accusative Case'''&lt;/font&gt;, you will learn now. It covers the [[w:Direct object|direct object]] and the [[w:Preposition|object of several prepositions]]. The third, the &lt;font style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;'''Dative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; will be taught later on. It covers the [[w:Indirect object|indirect object]] and the object of many other prepositions. 

The object of a sentence will be in accusative case.  In, &quot;You hurt me.&quot;, 'me' would be accusative.

Note: The &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''Accusative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;'''Dative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; are identical in English; that's why German has one case extra.

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Definite Article || '''den''' || die
| das || die
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Indefinite Article || '''einen''' || eine
| ein || -eine*
|}
&lt;small&gt;'''* The indefinite article for plurals is non-existent. However related words, such as possessives and the kein- words that you will learn later this lesson, will end in ''eine'' for plurals.'''&lt;/small&gt;

In the articles, the memory hook for accusative case is &quot;Der goes to den (pronounced &quot;dane&quot; {{audio|De-den.ogg|audio}}) and the rest stays the same.&quot; The masculine indefinite article goes to ''einen'', and everything else stays the same there. Therefore above, ''der'' Hamburger goes to ''den'' Hamburger and ''ein'' Hamburger goes to ''einen'' Hamburger when the hamburger is the direct object, such as in &quot;Er hat einen Hamburger.&quot; (&quot;He has a hamburger.&quot;)

If you are getting confused, it's fine. This topic is one of the hardest for English speakers to grasp. Here are some solutions:

To find out the case of something, first find the verb. The verb rules the sentence. Everything revolves around it. Next you find the subject of the sentence. The subject is the thing/person that is ''doing'' the verb. '''The subject is always in the &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Nominative Case&lt;/font&gt;, so it takes on the der, die, das, die, or ein, eine, ein.''' 

Now you look back at the verb. If it is a being verb (am, are, is, etc.), the next noun after the verb is the '''predicate noun'''. An easy way to figure this out is to write an equation. If the verb can be replaced with an equals sign (=), then the following noun is a predicate noun. If it can't be replaced by an equals sign, refer to the next paragraph. '''The predicate noun is also always in the &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Nominative Case&lt;/font&gt;, so the same rules apply to it.

 &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Ich&lt;/font&gt; bin &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''ein''' Junge&lt;/font&gt;.
 &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sie&lt;/font&gt; ist &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''eine''' Frau&lt;/font&gt;.

If the verb of the sentence is an action verb (playing, throwing, making, eating), find what the subject is doing the verb to. For example, if the verb is &quot;makes&quot; (macht), you look for what is being made. That is the direct object. '''The direct object is always in the &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;Accusative Case&lt;/font&gt;, so it takes on the den, die, das, die, or einen, eine, ein.'''

 &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sie&lt;/font&gt; haben &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''den''' Cheeseburger&lt;/font&gt;.
 Habt &lt;font style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;ihr&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''einen''' Salat&lt;/font&gt;?

The indefinite articles, when you just look at their endings, select e, -, e for nominative case, and en, e, -, e for accusative.

Remember, between nominative and accusative, the only third-person change is in the masculine form.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Articles|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Pronouns===

The pronouns experience a much bigger change than the articles. This is also true in English, as the articles (a, an, the) do not change ever, but ''I'' goes to ''me'', ''we'' goes to ''us'', etc. 

Not everything is the same, though. While ''me'' is ''mich'' and ''us'' is ''uns'', the second and third persons undergo different changes. In third person, as in the articles, the only change is in masculine singular. Following the &quot;der goes to den&quot; rule, ''er'' goes to ''ihn'' when in the accusative case. 

The second person in English never changes. In German, ''du'' goes to ''dich'' and ''ihr'' goes to ''euch''. ''Sie'', the formal version of either, stays the same. Remember, ''Sie'' (2nd person formal) and ''sie'' (3rd person plural) only differ in their meanings and the fact that the former is capitalized and the latter is not. This stays true throughout German grammar.

Here is a tabular representation of the above.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Pronouns|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Antecedents===

Note: ''This is just a quick lesson in English grammar applied into German. If you already know all about antecedents in English, skip the first paragraph.''

When using a pronoun, you have to know what it is for it to work. There are some rare exceptions, such as in mysteries or drama, but otherwise this is always true. Sometimes in dialogue this is taken care of by pointing or making some other gesture, but most of the time, the pronoun modifies something already mentioned. '''The object/person mentioned earlier that turns into a pronoun later is called the antecedent.''' 

In German this is very useful. You can't simply say 'it' any more. Many food words are masculine and feminine, and when you turn them into pronouns, they turn into 'he', 'she', 'him', and 'her', not always 'it'. For example, the sentence &quot;The cheeseburger tastes good. It's very crunchy.&quot; turns into &quot;The cheeseburger tastes good. ''He's'' very crunchy.&quot; Note: You will learn how to say this in German later in this lesson.

Why is it &quot;he&quot;? This is where the antecedent comes in. Because there are foods that are masculine and feminine in German, you can't assume the 'es'. You have to look back at the previous sentence, at the antecedent, ''der Cheeseburger''. &quot;Der Cheeseburger&quot; is replaced by ''er'' (since it is the subject, and therefore in Nominative Case). Therefore, all you need to know are these connections: der/den-er/ihn, die-sie, das-es, die-sie.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Antecedents|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Food-Related Verbs==

* ''essen (I)''  - to eat, to be eating, to do eat
* ''trinken'' - to drink, to be drinking, to do drink
* ''bekommen'' - to get/receive, to be getting/receiving, to do get/receive
* ''möchten (M)'' - would like
* ''wollen (M)'' - to want, to be wanting, to do want

Of these five verbs, only trinken and bekommen are regular. Essen is ''irregular'' (that's what the &quot;I&quot; means). Do you remember from the last lesson 'lesen' and 'sehen'? In both of them, the first 'e' changed to 'ie' in the du- and er/sie/es-forms. Well ''essen'' experiences the same change, except that it changes to 'i', not 'ie'. Also, it acts the same as 'lesen' in the du-form: You don't have three s's in a row.

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''isst''
|
 || sie || ''essen''
|}


''Isst'' sounds and looks a lot like ''ist''. The minute difference happens to be in the way you pronounce the ''s''. When you mean ''eats'' it is sometimes an overstressed hissing (i.e. extremely sharp) sound. In normal life Germans, too, can only tell which verb is meant from knowing the context. 

Just like in last lesson, where you could say, ''&quot;Ich spiele gerne Fußball.&quot;'', you can also extend it to food. &quot;I like to eat cheeseburgers.&quot; is translated as ''&quot;Ich esse gerne Cheeseburger.&quot; 

Before [[w:German spelling reform of 1996|1996]], the usage of ''ißt'' and ''eßt'' were common, but the new reform rules specify that these spellings are now the only correct spellings.

The last two verbs (marked ''(M)'') are ''modals''. They will be discussed in the next section.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Food-Related Verbs|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Modals==

In [[../Introduction|the introduction]], you learned that German has no helping verbs. Instead, they have '''modals''', words that basically do the same thing.

Modals are conjugated very differently from normal verbs. The ich- and er/sie/es-forms are always the same, while the du-form adds an 'st'. Most modals experience a vowel change from singular to plural, and the rest is the same.

===Möchten===

'Möchten' isn't technically a modal, but it acts exactly the same. There is no vowel change, and the ich- and er/sie/es forms are &quot;möchte&quot;. Here is the complete conjugation:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Singular&lt;/u&gt;
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1st''' || ich || ''möchte'' ||
 || wir
| ''möchten''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''möchtest'' ||
 || ihr
| ''möchtet''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''möchte''
|
 || sie || ''möchten''
|}

'Möchten' means &quot;would like&quot; and can be applied to food (e.g. Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger.). Möchten can be translated even more literally as &quot;would like to&quot;, and is traditionally used with an infinitive verb at the end of the sentence (e.g. &quot;Ich möchte jetzt gehen&quot;/&quot;I would like to go now&quot;). However, this infinitive is not necessary if it's completely obvious what you're talking about (If you say &quot;Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger&quot;, everyone will assume that you would like a cheeseburger to eat.)

(Note: ''Technically, &quot;möchten&quot; is not a word. The above cited conjugation is actually the &quot;Konjunktiv&quot; of &quot;mögen&quot;, which has become so popular as a phrase, that even many Germans today aren't aware of it any more, so you don't need to worry about it. &quot;Etwas mögen&quot; means &quot;to like to&quot;, and &quot;I would like&quot; is the closest translation of &quot;ich möchte.&quot;'')

===Wollen===

'Wollen' is a true modal; it even changes vowels. Ich/er/sie/es ''will'' and du ''willst''. Here is the complete conjugation:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Singular&lt;/u&gt;
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1st''' || ich || ''will'' ||
 || wir
| ''wollen''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''willst'' ||
 || ihr
| ''wollt''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''will'' ||
 || sie
| ''wollen''
|}

'Wollen' can also be applied to food, but may be considered impolite and demanding (&quot;Ich will einen Cheeseburger!&quot; roughly means &quot;I demand a cheeseburger!&quot; ''Möchten'' should be used instead: &quot;Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger!&quot; = &quot;I want a cheeseburger!&quot;).

'Wollen' should not be confused with the future tense, despite the presence of the English word 'will' in the conjugations. However, [[Wiktionary:will|will]] can also mean an intent or a document showing what one ''wants'' to happen. So it is not so different from 'to want' as possibly originally presumed.

===Modals with other verbs===

'''This is very important.''' When you need to use another verb with a modal (such as expressing you would like or want to perform an action), the sentence's word order is somewhat different than it would be in English. In English, you would state the subject pronoun (such as &quot;I&quot;), an English equivalent to the modal verb (such as &quot;want&quot;), the action you want to perform (such as &quot;to eat&quot;) and then what the action will be performed on (such as &quot;hamburger&quot;), making the sentence &quot;I want to eat a hamburger.&quot; In German you must put the action at the end of the sentence, making the sentence &quot;I want a hamburger to eat.&quot; (''&quot;Ich will einen Hamburger essen.&quot;'')

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Modals|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Hunger and Thirst==

In German, instead of saying, &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;(Ich bin hungrig), you may also say &quot;I have hunger.&quot;(Ich habe Hunger) The same applies to thirst. Here are the German translations of the corresponding nouns:

Hunger - der Hunger

Thirst - der Durst

Like in English, these two words do not have a plural form. When using them, you don't need to worry about the 'der'; you can just say, &quot;Ich habe Hunger&quot; to say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and &quot;Ich habe keinen Hunger&quot; for &quot;I am not hungry.&quot;

Somewhat archaic but still in use are the adjectives ''hungrig'' and ''durstig''. Those are often used when talking about someone (especially animals): &quot;Der Löwe ist hungrig&quot; for &quot;The lion is hungry&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Hunger and Thirst|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Formal Conversations==

In [[../Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]], you learned how to talk formally, using phrases like &quot;Guten Morgen!&quot; and &quot;Wie heißen Sie?&quot;. There are, however, a few words that are 'survival words' in Germany, specifically:

'''Danke''' - Thank you, Thanks

'''Bitte''' - Please ''and'' You're welcome.

To make this even more formal, you can tack on the word 'schön' to the end of &quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;You're welcome&quot; to make 'dankeschön' and 'bitteschön' (both one word) in response. 'Schön' literally means 'pretty' (you'll relearn this next lesson). 

'''Some other ways to say &quot;thank you&quot;:'''
* Dankeschön - Thank you very much
* Danke sehr - Thanks a lot
* Herzlichen Dank (&quot;herzlichen&quot; means sincere or from the heart; you may remember it from &quot;&lt;u&gt;Herzlichen&lt;/u&gt; Glückwunsch zum Geburtstag!&quot; last lesson)
* Vielen Dank - Thanks a lot
* Tausend Dank* - Thanks a million (literally meaning a thousand, but English is more generous)
* Aufrichtigen Dank* - would be &quot;thank you sincerely&quot; (''very'' formal)

&lt;small&gt;* - You will not be tested on these phrases.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Some other ways to say &quot;You are welcome&quot;:'''

* Bitteschön!
* Bitte sehr!
* Gern geschehen! - Don't mention it
* Gerne! - also meaning &quot;gladly&quot;
* Kein Problem! - No problem
* Dafür nicht!* - (Do) not (thank me) for this (only used in Northern Germany)

&lt;small&gt;* - You will not be tested on this phrase.&lt;/small&gt;

These might also be useful:

'''Entschuldigung''' - Excuse me, Pardon

'''Es tut mir leid''' - Sorry, I'm sorry

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Formal Conversations|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Kein-words==

Twice you have been taught that the ending of the indefinite article for plurals ''would be'' eine (for Nominative and Accusative cases), if there was an indefinite article for plurals. Now that lesson applies. The '''k'''ein-words have the same endings as the ein-words, and they mean the opposite: no, not any, none. For example, &quot;kein Cheeseburger&quot; means &quot;no cheeseburger&quot;. &quot;Keine Cheeseburger&quot; (in this case Cheeseburger is plural) means &quot;No cheeseburger'''s'''&quot;. Notice the 'e' at the end of 'keine'. That's the ending for plurals and feminine nouns and can be likened to the &quot;der, die, das -&gt; die&quot; relationship, where the feminine article serves for the plural as well.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Kein-words|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Ordering at a Restaurant in Germany==

das Restaur'ant' (French pronunciation)&lt;!--Gaststätte is older German and somewhat &quot;deprecated&quot;--&gt; - Restaurant {{Audio|Fr-Restaurant.ogg}}

There are many restaurants you might find in Germany. Much like in English-speaking countries, you would more likely use the name of the restaurant than name what kind of restaurant. If you want to address the wish to eat a certain food, there are two ways:

example: &quot;wanting to eat chinese food&quot;

1. &quot;Ich möchte gerne zum Chinesen.&quot; - literally: &quot;I want to go to the Chinese (restaurant).&quot;
2. &quot;Ich möchte gerne chinesisch essen (gehen).&quot; - literally: &quot;I want to (go) eat Chinese (style food).&quot;

Here are some more restaurants you can find in Germany:

* American food: &quot;zum Amerikaner&quot; / &quot;amerikanisch essen&quot;*
* Arabic food: &quot;zum Araber&quot; / &quot;arabisch essen&quot;
* Chinese food: &quot;zum Chinesen&quot; / &quot;chinesisch essen&quot;
* French food: &quot;zum Franzosen&quot; / &quot;französisch essen&quot;
* Greek food: &quot;zum Griechen&quot; / &quot;griechisch essen&quot;
* Italian food: &quot;zum Italiener&quot; / &quot;italienisch essen&quot;
* Indian food: &quot;zum Inder&quot; / &quot;indisch essen&quot;
* Japanese food: &quot;zum Japaner&quot; / &quot;japanisch essen&quot;
* Mexican food: &quot;zum Mexikaner&quot; / &quot;mexikanisch essen&quot;
* Spanish food: &quot;zum Spanier&quot; / &quot;spanisch essen&quot;
* Turkish food: &quot;zum Türken&quot; / &quot;türkisch essen&quot;
&lt;small&gt;* &quot;zum Amerikaner&quot; is often used in a jokey way, to express that one is going to either McDonald's or Burger King. There are few American restaurants, in Germany and they are mostly referred to as &quot;(American) Diner&quot;, so it is not used like &quot;zum Italiener&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;

==Accusative case prepositions==
You read at the beginning of this lesson that the &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;'''Accusative Case'''&lt;/font&gt; covers the direct object and the objects of some prepositions. Here are those prepositions that always fall under Accusative Case

''bis'' - until

''durch'' - through

''entlang'' - along

''für'' - for

''gegen'' - against

''ohne'' - without

''um'' - at, around

You learned ''um'' last lesson, and ''ohne'' earlier this lesson. ''Bis'', ''durch'', ''entlang'' and ''gegen'' will be taught in depth later, and ''für'' will be taught now. 

Up until this point, you have only worried about the Accusative Case in third person. ''Für'', meaning 'for', can and should be used in the first and second persons, too. Here's an example:

&quot;The cheeseburger is for me.&quot; - &quot;Der Cheeseburger ist ''für mich''.&quot;

As you can see, 'me' is put into accusative case because the preposition is ''für''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Accusative case preparations|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Saying How Food Tastes==

In German (as in English) there are several ways of telling how food tastes. You can do this with 'gut' and 'schlecht' from [[../Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]] to say:

'''Der Cheeseburger schmeckt gut - The cheeseburger tastes good'''  

'''Der Cheeseburger schmeckt schlecht - The cheeseburger tastes bad'''

But this is bland. Hopefully the food has more flavor than the description of it. You can use the following words to more colorfully describe how the cheeseburger tastes:

* delicious - ''lecker''

* delicious - ''delikat''* (a lot more formal than lecker)

* tasty - ''schmackhaft''

* juicy - ''saftig''*

* crunchy - ''knackig'' (can also mean ''crispy'')

* crispy - ''knusprig''*

* spicy - ''würzig'', ''pikant''

* stale, tasteless - ''fade''* (Austria: fad) 

* salty - ''salzig''

* oversalted - ''versalzen''* oder ''zu salzig''

* sweet - ''süß''

* bitter - ''bitter''

* sour - ''sauer''

* creamy - ''cremig''*

* hot (in the sense of &quot;very spicy&quot;) - ''scharf'' - literally meaning &quot;sharp&quot;

* hot (in the sense of &quot;very warm&quot;) - ''heiß''

* burnt - ''angebrannt''*

* cold - ''kalt''

* disgusting, terrible - ''schrecklich''

&lt;small&gt;* - You will not be tested on these descriptors.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Schmecken''' is a regular verb. Here is its conjugation:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFF66; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Person&lt;/u&gt; || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Singular&lt;/u&gt; || || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''1st''' || ich || ''schmecke'' ||
 || wir
| ''schmecken''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''2nd''' || du || ''schmeckst'' ||
 || ihr
| ''schmeckt''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| '''3rd''' || er/sie/es || ''schmeckt''
|
 || sie || ''schmecken''
|}

The first and second persons really shouldn't be used. No one is going to say, &quot;You guys taste salty&quot; or &quot;I taste creamy.&quot; So the only forms you ''really'' need to know are er/sie/es ''schmeckt'' and sie (plural) ''schmecken''.

You can use 'schmeckt' and 'schmecken' or 'ist' and 'sind' to state how the food tastes. Just use whichever one you would use in English and it'll usually be correct.

Although the English meaning of ''schmecken'' is simply ''to taste'', ''&quot;Schmeckt der Cheeseburger?&quot;'' can be taken in a positive way to mean &quot;Do you like the cheeseburger?&quot;. In other words, ''schmecken'' alone can mean ''to taste good''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Saying How Food Tastes|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Dieser-forms==

&quot;''The'' cheeseburger tastes good.&quot; does not sound that specific as to which cheeseburger you are talking about. You could be talking about a cheeseburger that is not directly in front of you. It just isn't clear. Now, if you said, &quot;''This'' cheeseburger tastes good.&quot;, it would be obvious that you're talking about the cheeseburger you're eating. 'Dieser' is the German translation for 'this': &quot;Dieser Cheeseburger schmeckt gut.&quot;

===Dieser===

'Dieser' is a special adjective. It changes forms in different situations: different genders and different cases. It can also mean 'these' when modifying a plural. Here are its forms:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Nominative Case || dies'''er''' || dies'''e'''
| dies'''es''' || dies'''e'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Accusative Case || dies'''en''' || dies'''e'''
| dies'''es''' || dies'''e'''
|}

As you can see, ''dieser'' is only appropriate for modifying masculine nouns in nominative case. But 'Cheeseburger', which is masculine, is the subject of the sentence, &quot;Dieser Cheeseburger schmeckt gut.&quot; So it is correct in that circumstance.

===Jeder===

''Jeder'' means 'every'. It acts exactly like 'dieser' in its endings, so it should be easy to remember. Here are the different forms:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Nominative Case || jed'''er''' || jed'''e'''
| jed'''es'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Accusative Case || jed'''en''' || jed'''e'''
| jed'''es'''
|}

Notice the absence of the plural form. When you think about this, it's the same in English: no one says 'every books'.

===Welcher===

'Welcher' is the third of this threesome of adjectives. 'Welcher' means 'which' and is used like the other [[w:Interrogative word|interrogatives]] (wer, was, wann, wo, warum, wie, and welcher). However, because the general subject has to be specified, ''welcher'' must be inflected before use: &quot;Welcher Hamburger ist seine?&quot;  Its forms have the same endings as 'dieser'.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99FF99; width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 || &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt;
| &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Plural&lt;/u&gt;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Nominative Case || welch'''er''' || welch'''e'''
| welch'''es''' || welch'''e'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Accusative Case || welch'''en''' || welch'''e'''
| welch'''es''' || welch'''e'''
|}

===Connection with Time===

You might want to say 'every day', 'this week', 'every morning', or 'which Tuesday night?'. But to do this, not only do you need to know the jeder-forms, but also the genders of the times and the cases. The second one is easy: '''Whenever you do something at a certain time, that time is put into &lt;font style=&quot;color: green;&quot;&gt;Accusative Case&lt;/font&gt;.''' Last lesson, you learned the gender of one time: ''der'' Tag. So now you know everything to say 'diesen Tag', 'jeden Tag', and 'welchen Tag?' (this day, every day, and which day?). Here are the cases of all the times in [[../Freizeit|Lesson 2]]:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| &lt;u&gt;Masculine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Feminine&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Neuter&lt;/u&gt;
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|
* Tag
* Monat
* Morgen
* Abend
* Nachmittag
|
* Woche
* Nacht
|
* Jahr
* Wochenende
|}

When extending to 'which Tuesday night?', remember that the night stays feminine on Tuesday, so it stays &quot;Welche Dienstagnacht?&quot;. Likewise, you can say 'every June' the same as 'every month': 'jeden Juni'.

===This and That===

''Ich möchte einen Cheeseburger. Der schmeckt sehr gut.''

''Ich esse jeden Tag Cheeseburger. Die habe ich gern.''

Look at the second sentence of each of these German dialogues. What's missing? That's right, instead of &quot;Der Cheeseburger schmeckt sehr gut.&quot; and &quot;Die Cheeseburger habe ich gern.&quot;, both of the 'Cheeseburgers, so to speak, are dropped. We're left with just the articles, only in this case, they aren't articles. They're '''demonstrative pronouns'''.

Demonstrative pronouns aren't scary. They're just the same as the normal pronouns, only they give more ''oomph'' to the sentence. They can be translated as either 'this' or 'that' (&quot;I'd like a cheeseburger. That tastes very good.&quot;), or 'these' or 'those' for plurals (&quot;I eat cheeseburgers every day. These I like.&quot;).

Demonstrative pronouns are exactly the same as the definite articles (well, there is one change in dative, but that will be covered in [[../Das Fest|Lesson 7]]). If you are not sure of the gender (meaning in context, the speaker doesn't know, not that you've forgotten that it's 'der Cheeseburger'), use 'das', like in &quot;Was ist das?&quot; (What is that?).

==Money and Paying==



Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Belgium and Südtirol – in other words: all German speaking regions except Switzerland and Liechtenstein– have given up their former currencies and adopted the Euro as of 1999. One ''Euro'' is worth 100 ''Cents''. Because they are not members of the European Union, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have kept the Swiss Francs (''Franken'' = 100 ''Rappen''). 

'Euro' normally does not change in the plural in German, so you would still say &quot;Ich habe 500 Euro.&quot; Nevertheless, there is an exception: Euro ''coins''. If you say &quot;Ich habe vier Euros.&quot;, you actually are saying that you have four 1-Euro coins. Because the backsides of euro coins look different in each country, many people in Europe have started collecting foreign euro coins. In this case you can say &quot;Ich habe irische Euros.&quot; (I have Irish euro coins.) for example.

There is not yet a rule whether or not the word ''&quot;Cent&quot;'' has a different plural form. The majority of Germans are using the word ''&quot;Cent&quot;'' as a plural form, but when they don't it is simply ''&quot;Cents&quot;''.

In German &quot;euro&quot; is pronounced [‘oi-ro], not [you-ro]. For &quot;Cent&quot; there are two pronunciations: you can either pronounce it as in English or you say &quot;tzent&quot;. The latter version seems to be preferred by older people.

When at a restaurant, you will want to pay at the end. You can use this vocabulary to help you.

* to pay - ''zahlen''

* the bill - ''die Rechnung''*

* the waiter - ''der Kellner'', ''die Bedienung (also ''der Ober'')**

* the waitress - ''die Kellnerin'' (but '''not''' ''die Oberin'' because this means ''Reverend Mother'')

* &quot;How much is that?&quot; - ''&quot;Was macht das?&quot;'' (&quot;What does that make?&quot;) or the &quot;umgangssprachliche&quot; ''&quot;Wie viel kostet das?&quot;''

&lt;small&gt; * To ask for the bill you can say, &quot;Bitte zahlen!&quot;, or make it a complete sentence: &quot;Ich würde gern zahlen!&quot;, or &quot;Wir möchten/wollen zahlen!&quot;. You can also say, &quot;(Herr Ober), die Rechnung bitte!&quot;. The term &quot;der Ober&quot; is the waiter, but this sounds very old fashioned and is hardly ever used today. To address the waiter you would probably say &quot;Entschuldigen Sie, ...&quot; (&quot;Pardon, ...&quot;) as in &quot;Entschuldigen Sie, wir würden gern zahlen&quot; (Pardon me, we would like to pay&quot;).&lt;/small&gt; 

&lt;small&gt; ** Although it is perfectly OK to say “Bedienung” or “Kellner” when talking about a waiter or a waitress, you should not address the waiter by saying &quot;Bedienung!&quot; or even “Fräulein!” which is regarded very impolite since the 1980s. &lt;/small&gt;

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Dieser-forms|Section Problems]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Procedure==
#In a small bowl stir up the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, add a pinch of unrefined sugar. Let the yeast activate for 10 minutes.
#To a large mixing bowl add the other 1/2 cup water, milk, unrefined sugar, melted vegan margarine, salt, tofu, and whole wheat flour. Stir with wooden spoon until creamy.
#Add the yeast mixture which should be foamy by now. Add walnuts. Add in the unbleached wheat flour a little at a time. Stir until the dough is too thick for the spoon then put the dough on a lightly floured cutting board or counter top and mix by hand. When all the flour is added, knead dough for around 5-7 minutes. Cover dough with a towel and let rise for around 1 to 1.5 hours. Dough should double in size.
#Knock the dough down once then place 2 equal portions of the dough into 2 greased pans. If you want the loaves to look fancy do this: roll dough into 4 separate dough &quot;snakes&quot;. Twist 2 of these together to make a nice looking intertwined loaf. Let rise about 45 minutes.
#Brush tops of loaves with melted margarine (keeps them from drying out) and dust with [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], uncooked oatmeal or white flour (aesthetics). Bake in oven preheated to 375F for around 35 minutes. When done, loaves will sound hollow when tapped.

Investing counselors advise that the best way to get a return on money is by starting up a business. This can take up many forms, from home-based business to a storefront to franchising. ''' Franchising ''' is a safe way to get into business for an inexperienced person because a corporation gives extensive help in getting the new venture started.</text>

The stock markets are a means to buy and sell, but they are a market place: when, what, and how often and how much one buys, accumulates or sells is NOT the province of the market: that is the province of the field of investment which is covered elsewhere.  Investment in general is a rich and complex field as it serves all kinds of investors, government, corporations, services, groups and individuals: each investor has her own objective, her own access to capital which to invest.  Indeed, the subject of investing can well be approached from the investors point of view.
Given that I am writing this here in a wiki, an information forum open to and created by the community of the world, it might be appropriate to direct this summary to the individual small investor, who invests as part of a long term and life long plan of savings for herself, her family and heirs. Again, the market is a place where one trades (buys and sells) financial instruments, such as stock, bonds and the many forms of these instruments, and is not itself concerned with investing, ie, the strategy for making a profit under many many varied desires and circumstances. 
This section under the stock market should be dry, technical and thorough, and should serve as a reference.  However, to understand the vehicles, form a coherent view of ones own objectives and the appropriate vehicles: stocks (common, preferred) bonds (convertible or not) one should start with an introduction to investing, and most likely, focusing at first on individual investing, which should be the most straight forward and the most useful.


Traditionally the US stock exchange has given an annual average return of seven percent after adjusting for inflation. This makes it one of the most  lucrative investments available. Granted, there is no guarantee that the market will behave in the future as it has in the past, but it has been consistent in some respects over its 70+ year history.

The challenge and lure of Investing come from the fact that it is an inexact science. In physics, there are a few laws which govern a large variety of physical phenomena. In Investing, there are no such comparable laws. Investing is all about predicting the future. Since, there are a large number of factors influencing the future price of a stock, there is always a degree of uncertainty with any position.

Stocks are just one kind of financial instruments. The field is complicated by the fact that there are mutual funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), options, futures , bonds and several other kind of financial instruments. It takes almost a year to just familiarize oneself with the jargon of the field.


== Finding  a broker ==
There are several options to consider when finding a broker.  These include but are not limited to the following:  Full service brokers, discount brokers, and financial advisors.  Each have their advantages and disadvantages. Transaction cost, experience, history and strategy are all factors to consider when hiring a broker.

A full service broker is a broker that will generally come with the highest up front costs.  These costs are probably the full service broker's biggest disadvantage.  However, the broker history plays a large role in the weight of this disadvantage.  If the full service broker proves to have a history of high returns, they may be worth the initial fee, with the assumption they may be able to make you more than your average expected return after the fees are paid.  When choosing a full service broker, one should interview several brokers.  This serves as a good way to view their history, ask about their experience, costs and finally their strategy.  Their strategy is what stocks and funds they are most familiar with and their justification as to why they pick the stocks they do.  If one is adverse to larger transaction costs and doesn't mind using a more hands on approach,  then he may want to look at more cost effective methods, such as a discount broker.  Generally these brokers will be cheaper than their full service cousins (hence the name 'discount'), but they may require more interaction from the user.

Ameritrade, Brown &amp; Co, and Interactive Brokers are some of the most cost effective brokers around. Barron's and Forbes periodically compare these brokers.

==Understanding Stock Fundamentals==
Stock market prices fluctuate everyday, and no stock is completely safe. However, there are certain things that you can look at to try to determine the best stocks. The price of stocks is based on two things: hype, and the fundamental value of the company. You must be careful about stocks with lots of hype that lack strong fundamentals, because they have strong potential to lose much of their value rather quickly. 

When looking at a company, you will first notice its price. The listed price is generally taken as the most recent trade price on an open market. If you multiply the total shares outstanding by the price per share, you get the market capitilization (abbreviated market cap), which reflects the current market value of the company. The book value is the value of the various assets that make up the company. Many companys' market values are many times the book value, which reflects non-tangible assets like customer relationships.

What really drives the prices, however, is earnings. The earnings are the money made, which is the sales or revenue minus the costs of doing business, among other things. Earnings are analyzed in relation to price by a value called the P/E or price to earnings ratio.  The primary way to use the P/E ratio is in a relative valuation.  That means, how cheap is this company/stock compared to similar companies.  If company A and B are equally profitable, have similar levels of assets and debt, and are growing at similar rates, then the stock with the lower P/E would appear to be a &quot;better deal&quot; or is possibly undervalued.  The major pitfall in this approach comes when both companies A and B are presently overvalued, which could precede a drop in the stock price.  There were numerous examples of this during the dot-com &quot;bubble&quot; and it's subsequent &quot;burst&quot;.

Again, as a warning, it is imperative to note that one of the major conditions for determining relative value using P/E ratios is the growth rate of a company. If company A has a higher P/E ratio than company B, it is highly likely that the higher ratio is justified by a higher growth rate of company A's earnings.

==Understanding Stock Technicals==

{{mergefrom|Technical Analysis}}

Some people give lots of importance to the price/volume behavior of stocks. The price and volume of a stock can be charted against time. A good thing about the price/volume history is that it does not lie.

Also, you will read the disclaimer in several places that past performance  does not predict the future. If the past performance, does not mean anything to future, why even study it? No amount of chart reading would have predicted the Enron Collapse.

The rationale for looking at the charts is that it helps you identify the patterns and/or trends. Fundamental analysis tells you what to buy and technical analysis is supposed to tell you when to buy.

== Choosing stocks ==

The first thing to remember is that stocks are risky, and even the least risky stock can on occasion go down in value or even bankrupt. You can find out about companies from all over, but before buying you should thoroughly research the company. Also, keep in mind that many people including so-called professionals are often wrong. 
Over 80% of actively managed mutual funds do not generate better returns (after they take their fees) than the major indexes. 

A well known investor named Warren Buffett claims that &quot;Rule number one&quot; is, &quot;don't lose money.&quot;  This is easier said than done and if you can not tolerate modest, near term, temporary losses, simply buy new issue Treasury Bonds, hold them to maturity and do not expect much income (that will be taxed like wages, at higher rates), after inflation. Historically, stocks have generally provided better returns albeit with added risk. The older you are the less risk you should be willing tolerate.

Warnings aside, the first thing to consider is risk. How much debt does the company have? Are they earning money, and will they continue earning money. Read their annual report, and look at their business, and think about what could happen that could hurt their business. Listening to conference calls is a rarely used but great way to assess the company's management. You can hear if the presentation of results and predicitons made sound honest and realistic.  Risky stocks may be a good investment, but you should always be aware of the risks beforehand, and decide what you are going to do if the worst comes to pass.

After taking a hard look at the risks, you also have to look at the potential for the company, and the likelihood that it will happen. For example a solar cell company, may have huge potential if the government mandated solar cells on top of every building, but that is very unlikely to happen.

Look at the current price/earnings(P/E) ratio and what it would be in the future with various levels of growth. Also, look and see if  the company pays dividends. Often, the earning number is inflated  through accounting tricks, but the dividend is what the company paid stockholders last year. If the company has a good dividend, you can make a bit every year while continuing  to hold the stock.

While the fundamentals, and how much money the company makes will affect it over the long term, other factors  often dominate the markets in the short term. During the late 90's tech stocks got bid up, because they were hyped up in the media. After September 11, investors worried about terrorism, and stocks were priced accordingly. The market has day-to-day fluctuations, but usually there are certain themes from the media that hype something, that over-values or under-values certain stocks and segments of the market. However, when the theme goes away--often rather quickly--those stocks will correct (go up or down to their intrinsic or fundamental value). One short-term strategy would be to try to ride the themes, and profit, but it can at times be quite difficult, and mistakes often result in heavy losses. If you are going to buy a stock that you think will go up on hype use extreme caution. A more sensible approach is to try to buy things that are fundamentally undervalued before you think a cycle will start hyping that particular area of the market.

The value of a share of stock is based on many things but how much the &quot;market&quot; thinks the company will make in the future is the usually the biggest factor in what dicatates the current selling price.

Anticipating price movements will generally give much better results than reacting to them, in both the short and long term.  It is important to recognize that the past does not dictate the future, but it can give some insight.  Stocks with long histories of increasing value (including dividends when applicable) are more likely to continue appreciating than those with an erratic past.  

Recognize that the sector a company is in can be as or even more important to the share price as the company's fundamental future earnings expectations.  Chasing after stocks with significant recent price appreciation may work but more likely buying an already over priced stock will cause losses.  An important truism is that, &quot;The wise man(woman) does first what a foolish one does last.&quot;  Ask anyone who waited until late 1999 to buy tech stocks because they decided, &quot;everyone is getting rich except me.&quot;      

Consider reviewing the past price performance of each security you consider buying or selling as a small part of your fundamental analysis.  This is best achieved by using price charts of varying lengths of time.

The easiest part of stock investing is buying; you just need money.  The hardest part is deciding if and/or when to sell; that requires wisdom.  Failing to sell or buying an overvalued stock will almost always lead to losses and vice versa.  It is wise to decide on your selling price and loss limit before you buy a stock (and sticking to them).  

Never let tax consequences dictate you purchases and sales but keep in mind there are tax incentives (different tax rates on gains and losses) for holding shares with gains for a year and a day.  This also serves to diminish the tax benefit if you have losses.  It is always better to pay a high tax on a high gain than a low tax on a high gain that evaporates into a low gain.

No one likes to lose money but it is part of all but the most conservative investment strategies; no one honestly bats 1000.  Try very hard not to allow emotions, hope or pride to affect your decisions.  It is far better to acknowledge a mistake and take a small loss (that is not likely to be short lived) than to let to let it become a large loss.  Never chide yourself for buying or selling too early.  It is far better than waiting until it is too late and realizing a larger loss.  There are very few stocks that you can buy and hold for a lifetime.

If you are unwilling to learn about a company/industry/sector on a fundamental basis you should not attempt to pick individual stocks. It is more appropriate to buy an index, mutual, or exchange traded fund based on your views of the future. This entails less risk (as well as lower returns) than stock picking, reducing possible losses. If you have the inclination and time to learn how and do fundamental analysis you will generally realize better results over time.  

You must also recognize that share prices can sometimes become completely disconnected and unrelated to fundamental, intrinsic value not merely over or under priced.  That is the greatest opportunity for gains (or losses) as noted above over the long term. 

There is only one true thing about the stock market and stock prices; they will fluctuate.  This observation is attributed to JP Morgan.

==Risk, Risk Premiums and Diversification==
Stocks are risky.  There is no guarantee that the return on a particular stock will beat the market average or even be positive.  The riskier a stock is the greater its average return (but with a greater risk of no return or worse).  This is called the &quot;risk premium&quot;.  Essentially, the seller is giving a discount to the buyer in return for taking on risk.

Risk can be reduced through diversification while retaining the same average return (called the &quot;expected return&quot;).  Imagine a stock (stock A) costing $10 with a 50% chance of paying $2 and a 50% chance of paying $0.  This stock would have an expected return of $1 (the average of 2 and 0) but would be risky.  Now imagine that instead of buying 10 shares of stock A we bought 5 shares plus 5 shares of stock B.  The cost and payback of B is identical to A with the caveat that B is a stock in an industry totally unrelated to A, and thus is not linked in its results.  The stock A + B combination now has exactly the same expected return as A alone, but with lower risk!  In other words:

DIVERSIFICATION LOWERS RISK WHILE MAINTAINING RETURNS.

The more diverse a portfolio is, the less risky it is.  This is one of the rationals behind the new breed of index funds which recreate broad indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Wiltshire index.  For long-term investing, index funds of this type are an excellent choice.

==When to Sell==
Knowing when to sell is often the most difficult part of buying and selling stocks. When a stock goes down, it is often difficult to admit that you made a mistake. When a stock goes up, will it keep going up? It is easy in hindsight to think that you should have held onto stock when you see it go up after you sold. 

You generally don't know when a stock has really reached its peak, or whether it will go back up again, but there are some things to look for. Remember the reason you bought the stock. Considering all currently available data, is that reason still valid? Try to avoid coming up with new justifications for holding a falling stock. If you bought the stock, because you thought the company's new product would do really well, and it hasn't it may be time to sell. 

There is nothing wrong with admitting you were wrong. However, you also need to be careful you aren't just selling to buy into the latest fad, either. The way the stock market works has been fairly consistent for many years. Different sectors have become hot, and later become not so hot. If you are going to revise your strategy, make you sure you still consider long term trends.

However, if something doesn't continue to fit your strategy, sell it. It doesn't matter if it has gone up a lot, or is almost worthless. Unless, you still think it fits with your strategy sell it. Remember, just because it may have a chance of going up a lot, doesn't mean there isn't another stock out there that is better. Selling based simply on past performance is generally a bad idea.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rental properties are a way to have a long-term monthly income as well as build equity, meaning that the property has value in itself that can be recovered upon sale. 

= Me, a landlord? =
You, yes, you, can be a landlord.  Well, maybe not *you*, but that other guy over there.  Yes, him.

He's got reasonably good credit, some initial cash, plus a moderate amount of time and patience to deal with initial paperwork and projects.  He's willing to make his life more complicated now in the hope that he might be exchanging it for greater wealth later.  And he lives very near an area where people are looking to rent.

To be a landlord, he will need: a place to rent (fully insured), tenants in that place, and carefully constructed written agreements with the tenants (leases) that talk about how everyone is expected to behave, including how much the tenants will pay.  If he doesn't have a place already, he'll need to buy it, which will mean negotiating with the previous owners (or their agents) and bankers. 

If the landlord can find a place to buy such that his monthly total of mortgage payments, insurance, taxes, utility, repair and miscellaneous costs are less than the rent he's taking in, he'll be making money.  This may not be realistic at the start.  A high property cost, low amount of down payment, a less than ideal interest rate, high taxes and critical property repairs could push expenses too high for profit.  But he'll never know for sure until he researches his local market and starts making calls.

= Choosing a property =
== Single Family Houses ==
Houses are a higher risk than apartments and condominiums simply because usually a house costs more and therefore you have a higher risk of negative monthly cash flow if your property is vacant.  With a condo, since the overall cost is usually less, your exposure to risk is less.  Likewise in an apartment since there are more units to rent if one is vacant there will still be some rent collected every month.  For instance if an investor buys a 4 unit building (four-plex), with 2400 total square feet, then rents each 600 square foot unit for $500/month, the total rent collected is $2000 dollars.  Lets say this same investor buys a 2400 square foot single family home and rents it for the same $2000 a month.  The risk is obvious; the single family tenant could decided to leave, then the investor is stuck with a property with zero dollars collected for rent.  While the four-plex only has one unit vacant, the other three are still rented thus the investor has $1500 of rent still coming in.  The four-plex is a much smaller risk.  

The other negative is a multi-unit investment property usually rents at a higher rate per square foot than a single family house.  Lets assume this same investor can get around $0.83 per square foot for a single family house while the four-plex will rent at $1 per square foot.  That is $2400 of total potential rent for the four-plex, and $2000 for the single family house.  It is obvious multi-family investing is better for maximizing positive cash-flow for a real estate investor.

On a positive note single-family houses have tended to appreciate faster and more steadily than condos, in a steady real estate market, although that's no guarantee of future price changes. For this reason the single family house may equalize the monthly cash flow of a condominium when looking at a long-term investment (5 to 10 years +).  It is important to look at the history of the neighborhood and region you are investing in to determine the best strategy that meets your financial goals before investing in single family houses. But remember, history is only a guide - the future may be very different and can't be predicted. Even the nicest area now can become a slum in the future.

== Multiplexes ==
== Apartments ==
== Condos ==
Condos are a great place to start for first time investors, simply because they require very little 'exterior' maintenance. Usually you pay an 'Association Fee' (HOA) that does all the 'Common Area' maintenance. This leaves you free to concentrate on the inside and taking care of the renters.

Be wary, however.  In a condo agreement, you are vulnerable to risks associated with the other condos.  If another condo owner in the association goes bankrupt, you may be subject to higher HOA fees.  Likewise, if another condo falls into disrepair it may become very difficult to rent or sell your unit.  The larger fraction of ownership each associate owns, the greater the risk.  Condo rules may change without your consent, as they are subject to majority votes; imagine the association deciding the units can no longer be rented!

== Public Housing ==
== Vacation Properties ==

= Buying the property =
== Financing the purchase ==
You don't actually need to have a lot of cash on hand to buy a property.  All you need is to have access to cash.  This can be through equity that you withdraw from your home through a second mortgage or line of credit, or the cash a partner in a joint venture provides.  This initial cash - whatever the source - provides your down payment.

When you have a down payment that is sufficiently large (10% of purchase price, 25% or some other amount), a lender can lend you the rest.  This lent sum will normally be secured against the value of the property, through a mortgage.

Remember though the interest you are paying on the loan reduces your profit and the level of your risk increases the more you borrow... if your property is empty you still need to pay the mortgage.


= Renting the property =
Predicting rental income from a property is important because it is your only source of active income from the investment.  The property may gain value over time and provide you with return upon sale of the property in the future, but it should not expected.  Your rental property investment should be profitable on the rental income alone.

There are several ways to estimate rental income.  In rough order of accuracy:
* The property may be currently rented, or have a rental history.  Request this information from the seller.
* Ask your real estate agent for a list of rental income statements from properties in the immediate area.  Highlight those that are similar to the property of interest (# of beds/baths, sq. ft, general appearance, amenities, etc).  This can be very easy if a subdivision has identical homes, or rather difficult if the area is diverse (socioeconomically, and building type).  Pay close attention to location nuances; depending on your target renter you may note public school district boundaries, busy streets, parks/stores/entertainment, nearby colleges etc.  Try to compare the differences between your potential investment and the similar homes.  Keep track of positive and negative characteristics and do your best to estimate rental income.
* Use the 'Rent Zestimate' from Zillow.com.  Zillow provides a range for this estimate; the smaller the range, the more certain the Zestimate is.  Keep in mind Zillow may not have complete or accurate information about the property.  It's up to you verify the statistics Zillow presents.  Hint!  If the information on Zillow is not current, your seller's agent is inexperienced or an old timer.  Either way, the audience of potential buyers for the property is smaller and you may be able to negotiate more aggressively.

Once you have estimated the rental potential, it's time to correct the figure for vacancy and management costs.  If you plan to manage the property yourself, do not correct for management.  Management costs range from 8 to 12% of rental income on average.  Skimping here may result in unruly tenants, more vacancy, and unchecked maintenance.  Paying a premium may save you in the vacancy and maintenance department.  10% is a good rule of thumb for initial calculations.  Vacancy should be expected and projected as well.  Rule of thumb: 7% (about 1 month a year).  Therefore, if you estimate rent to be $1,000 a month, multiply by .9 and then by .93 to obtain $837.  Sobering, but if you calculate conservatively your risk will be mitigated.

JAL 328 H1S - Writing Systems
2003

This course examines the nature of writing and its relationship to language. We look at the major writing systems of the world from four perspectives:

a. History
b. Internal structure
c. Relation to the language
d. Sociolinguistics

For example, for Chinese, we will look at

The earliest history of Chinese writing (oracle-bone inscriptions).
Some of the major calligraphic styles of Chinese writing over the ages.
The relationship of Chinese writing to the language (essentially, each syllable is written with one character, and different morphemes are written differently).
How many characters there are in Chinese. How characters are ordered in a dictionary. How borrowed words are written with characters.
Traditional and simplified (20th century) forms of characters .
The role of writing in Chinese society, e.g., the Civil Service Examinations.
The borrowing of Chinese characters to write Japanese and Korean.

Phthong is an interactive program to teach the phonemic transcription of English. Two versions exists ­ one for LIN 100 and one for LIN228. They differ primarily in the symbols they use; LIN228 has standard IPA symbols. Phthong was developed at the University of Toronto by Henry Rogers and Michael Stairs.

The version available here shows broad phonemic pronunciations for Toronto English.

Phthong has been developed over a number of years by Henry Rogers and Michael Stairs. Originally, it was written in HyperCard for the Macintosh computer and has been used in that form successfully for a number of years at the University of Toronto. Stairs has been responsible for the computer design and programming of both the HyperCard and JAVA versions; Rogers has been responsible for the pedagogical design. Michael Stairs works for the CHASS facility (Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences) at the University of Toronto.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thoughts on Logan's The Alphabet Effect
by Dominic Yu
2003 January 3 

In Chapter 3 (&quot;A Comparison of Eastern and Western Writing Systems and Their Impact on Cultural Patterns&quot;) of Robert K. Logan's The Alphabet Effect, Logan claims that &quot;the absence of Western-style abstractions and classification schemes in Chinese culture&quot; (47), including such things as systematic logical reasoning, codified legal systems, and monotheism, is due to the fact that Western writing is alphabetic, whereas Chinese writing is not. In this essay, I will show that most of Logan's arguments are flawed, and that Logan's main points, although interesting, ultimately tell us little more than the fact that Chinese characters are complex. 

Logan's basic premise, that Chinese characters are inherently less abstract than alphabetic characters, is incorrect. He states that &quot;the alphabet is used phonetically to visually represent the sound of a word,&quot; whereas &quot;Chinese characters are used pictographically to represent the idea of a word and hence are less abstract than alphabetic writing&quot; (47, emphasis mine). However, this is an inaccurate description of Chinese writing. While there do exist characters which are historically derived from pictograms, all Chinese characters represent sounds, just as the symbols from all other writing systems in the world represent sounds. Moreover, the forms of Chinese characters have been revised and simplified so many times in the course of their development that the vast majority of them are no longer transparently recognizable (one would need the help of historical texts). Thus, the description of Chinese writing as &quot;pictographic&quot; applied to the standard characters that have been used for the last two thousand years or so is not appropriate. Take, for example, the character ?, representing the third person singular pronoun &quot;ta&quot;. The left hand component, the &quot;person&quot; radical, indicates that this character vaguely has something to do with a person or people. I say &quot;vaguely&quot; because this is a very common radical is also used in characters such as ?, ?, and ?, meaning, &quot;portion,&quot; &quot;fake,&quot; and &quot;to do,&quot; respectively. The right side is a phonetic component indicating that (at some earlier stage of Chinese), this character rhymed with ?, now pronounced &quot;ye?.&quot; Nothing in this character indicates the idea of &quot;third person singular pronoun.&quot; From this example, we can see that Chinese characters mainly represent sounds, and only represent ideas in a rather insignificant way. Thus, Logan's claim that Chinese characters represent the &quot;idea of a word&quot; is baseless. 

In his first concrete example, Logan talks about the Chinese legal system, saying that Chinese law was not codified. While this may be a true statement, Logan provides no evidence that this has anything to do with the writing system. He only states that &quot;the Chinese developed two concepts of law: 'fa' and li'&quot; (50), and then proceeds to explain these two concepts. What he overlooks, though, is that this has nothing to do with the writing system; the number and/or types of concepts associated with any concept, including law, is independent of the writing system. The concepts develop, and people subsequently find ways of writing them down on paper. Indeed, concepts are borrowed from culture to culture throughout history; with the influence of Buddhism from India, for example, Chinese writing adapted by making up new characters or adapting old ones for new uses. Another example: many of the philosophers/thinkers of the Enlightenment in seventeenth century Europe, such as Leibniz and Voltaire, were inspired by Chinese philosophy. But I digress. 

Next, Logan claims that &quot;the Chinese ideographic script&quot; was one of the &quot;inhibitory factors to the growth of modern science&quot; (54), for two reasons: first, the Chinese script has subliminal or hidden effects which are adverse to abstract scientific thinking; second, the alphabet, being a natural tool for classification, served as a paradigm for scientific classification (55). Logan gives absolutely no evidence to support the first claim. He merely lists, in his Table III (56), twelve characters, the scientific term in English that each character is supposed to represent, and a description of what the original symbol represented. For example, the character ?, meaning &quot;to begin,&quot; is described as &quot;a drawing of a woman and a fetus.&quot; Logan states: 

an examination of the table reveals that even the most abstract scientific term must be rendered in a concrete form when it is written. This, no doubt, has had a subliminal effect on Chinese scientific thinking. (55) 

As we have argued above, the forms of the Chinese characters in use for the last two thousand years can hardly be described as &quot;concrete.&quot; In fact, I would guess that most readers of Chinese would not even think of the character for &quot;begin&quot; as being a drawing of a woman and a fetus (if indeed that is what it is; it seems like a simple phonetic to me, as it rhymes with things like ?, ?, and ?), and even if they had read elsewhere that that was what the character originally represented, their minds have better things to do than to dwell upon that fact every time they come across the character in their readings. Thus, in the spirit of the scientific method, I would suggest that the subliminal effect that Chinese characters have on scientific thinking is a topic to be investigated, rather than the foregone conclusion that Logan thinks it is. 

Logan's second reason, that alphabetic writing served as a paradigm for scientific classification and therefore abstract scientific thought, also stands on shaky ground. First of all, Chinese characters can certainly be classified, in any number of ways: by radical, stroke order, stroke count, or even phonetically. In fact, the sheer number of them necessitates some sort of classification scheme. But even granted that the Chinese script is complex (e.g., it has been said that Chinese phone books are hard to use, and looking in a dictionary for a character which one does not know the pronunciation of can certainly bring up its own difficulties), we must first discuss a more fundamental issue, and that is the nature of modern science. Logan seems to think that classification is key to modern science. In fact, classification is a fundamental cognitive process, and humans have been engaging in it for millenia. What is unique about modern science, it seems to me, is not classification, but the entire process which we call the scientific method: observation, analysis, construction of a hypothesis, and testing of said hypothesis, which goes back to observation and analysis. Modern science is about building unified theories and models that help up explain and predict the world; it is not about classifying things into a set number of categories. 

Logan's most ridiculous claim is that the development of monotheism was encouraged by alphabetic writing. (Indeed, there is no reason to think that polytheism vs. monotheism even falls into the concrete/abstract distinction that Logan makes, but this is beyond the scope of this essay.) Of the major religions practiced today, all three monotheistic ones—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--can be said to be derived from the same source, the religion of the Israelites, which began, let's say, with Moses around 1300 BCE. This was several centuries before the Greek alphabet (the first true alphabet) was developed, around 1000 BCE. Note also that Greek religion was by no means monotheistic, even though their writing system was alphabetic. The other noteworthy monotheistic religion, Zoroastrianism, came about around 600 BCE in modern-day Afghanistan/Iran, where at that time they were still using cuneiform. 

We have seen above that Logan's arguments about the impact of Chinese logographic writing on law, science, and religion are completely without basis. Moreover, Chinese characters, though complex, are not more concrete than alphabetic writing in any essential way, and certainly not pictographic, as he describes. The history of cultures and ideas is complex, with many different concepts and entities interacting. In view of this, the impact that the form of a writing system makes on concepts such as science, law, and religion must be very negligible indeed.

So who really invented the alphabet?  
Stephanie Saldana The Daily Star 
March 18, 2002  
 
Lebanese, Syrians and Egyptians all vie for a piece of ABC history
 
Ask the folks in Byblos who invented the alphabet and chances are high that they’ll claim they did. Up and down the cobbled alleys of the souq, shop windows display tablets proclaiming the first alphabet as Phoenician, and locals insist that the earliest remnants of it were unearthed in ruins nearby. 

“Of course it was invented here,” said souvenir shop owner Tony Karam from behind the counter of his shop downtown. 

If the Phoenicians invented the alphabet in Byblos, apparently no one ever told that to the Syrians hanging out near their port city of Lattakia. Here, outside of the archaeological site of Ras Shamra, locals peddle postcards headlined Earliest Alphabet in the World, but display a picture of a different alphabet altogether: the Ugaritic. 

Local guide Saji Qorqmaz, who leads tours through the crumbling Royal Palace where that alphabet was discovered, holds fast to his own explanations of alphabetic origins. “The idea for the alphabet was created in Egypt, the invention was in Ugarit, and the distribution was in Byblos,” he said. Byblos? Ugarit? Egypt? If the alphabet is really as easy as ABC, how did so many people become confused about its origins? According to Jo Ann Hackett, professor of Near Eastern languages at Harvard University and an expert on the alphabet, Syria and Lebanon might both have claims to developing “an alphabet,” but today scholars are looking toward Egypt for true alphabetic origins. 

“The Ugaritic alphabet and the Phoenician, or linear alphabet, were separate inventions, so they can’t really be compared as if they were on the same timeline,” she said in an interview via email. “Still, both the Syrians and perhaps the Lebanese can claim that their ancestors developed ‘an’ alphabet.” 

Robert Fradkin, professor of Asian and East European languages at the University of Maryland, agrees. “Quite a controversy indeed, but I don’t think it’s worth arguing over who was first, as if ‘the alphabet’ was a conscious concrete goal like a race to land a man on the moon,” he said. “It was part of a large cultural trend.” 

While tour guides might be anxious to build on earliest alphabet hype, scholars argue that the search for the origins of the alphabet involves far more than merely digging up and deciphering old inscriptions. The alphabet evolved over thousands of years, possibly in response to trade in the ancient Middle East. The fact that people, products and alphabets moved from place to place makes it nearly impossible for archaeologists to be certain if the alphabets they dig up originated where they found them, or were carried there from somewhere else. 

“How did the alphabet develop? There is no final or conclusive evidence on the origin of the alphabet,” said Helen Sader, professor at the American University of Beirut and an expert on Semitic languages. “What is certain is that it did not develop overnight.” 

Recently Yale Egyptologist John Darnell stumbled upon evidence that may shed light upon the alphabet debate. Surveying ancient travel routes in southern Egypt in 1993-94, he and his wife Deborah came upon strange graffiti marked into walls near Wadi al-Hol located across from the ancient city of Thebes. 

In 1999, scholars determined that the graffiti was an alphabet that predates the Byblos Phoenician example by 800 years. Not yet deciphered, the Semitic script, written with Egyptian influences between 1900-1800 BC, seems to have been developed by Semitic people working in Egypt. Unable to read thousands of Egyptian pictographs, Semites may have developed their own crude alphabet for communication. 

Yet like most things involving the alphabet, scholars disagree on origins. 

“We don’t actually know where this alphabet was invented,” said Hackett of the finds. Bruce Tuckerman, who photographed the inscriptions, told The New York Times wryly: “This is fresh meat for the alphabet people.” 

The Egyptian discovery may help scholars understand why Phoenicians in Byblos used the alphabet they did some 800 year later. Scholars believe that Darnell’s alphabet ­ based partially on sounds represented by Egyptian pictographs, may have traveled north over centuries toward Lebanon, changing and modernizing along the way. 

Evidence of an alphabet dating from 1600 BC ­ 200 years after the Wadi al-Hol alphabet ­ has been discovered by archaeologists in Semitic speaking territory in the Sinai peninsula and farther north in the Syria-Palestine region occupied by Canaanites. Not only do these alphabets bear similarities to those of Wadi al-Hol, but they also appear to be the ancestors of what would later become the Phoenician alphabet, the most famous inscription of which was found in Byblos on the tomb of Ahram dating from 1000 BC. 

“The linear (Phoenician) alphabet seems to have been developed by Semites in Egypt and adapted by Canaanites,” said Sader, adding that evidence for this development was found mainly in Palestine in the 13th and 12th centuries BC. The Phoenicians adapted the script even further, laying the foundations for the Greek and Latin alphabets. 

As to why so many Lebanese still believe that Phoenicians invented the alphabet, Sader blames the Greeks. “Today nobody believes that one man sat down and had the genius to invent the alphabet … Greek legend attributes the discovery of the alphabet to the Phoenicians, because they did not know of the development of their alphabet before then,” she said. “What the Phoenicians have done is … spread the alphabet through all of Europe.” 

While this clears up the confusion between Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt, it still doesn’t explain how Syrians found their way into the alphabet soup. Strangely, the story of Syria’s claims to creating the alphabet involve not just another country, but different people and another alphabet altogether. 

In the late 1940s, archaeologists excavating in the Royal Palace of Ras Shamra in coastal Syria uncovered something rather extraordinary ­ an entire library of ancient clay tablets, sacred and administrative documents impressed with unusual wedge shaped letters. Further investigation revealed that these shapes were in fact the components of what would later be known as the “Ugaritic” alphabet, a simplified system of 30 symbols, each symbol representing a different consonant sound of the local Ugaritic language. Developed between the 14th and 12th centuries BC, the Ugaritic alphabet was in use at virtually the same time as the predecessors of the Phoenician or “linear” alphabet. By the 14th century, communities in the Middle East were using different alphabets simultaneously. 

Unlike the linear or “Phoenician” alphabet, which seems to have developed from Egypt, partially from pictographs, the Ugaritic is a cuneiform alphabet based on wedge shaped consonants, with origins that remain mysterious to this day. That means that while Syrians can’t claim to have the earliest alphabet in the world, they can at least claim the earliest known “cuneiform” alphabet. 

Yet even this could change. 

Scholars admit that, limited by archaeology, they may never understand the origins of the alphabet. And in the meantime, this won’t keep tour guides from claiming the alphabet as their own. 

“Guides all want to be proud of their own place ­ in Syria you’ll hear Ugarit, in Lebanon you’ll hear Byblos, in Egypt you’ll hear I don’t know what,” admitted Waad Khalife, a Byblos tour guide. 

“Colleagues and local civilians are not the most objective in their jobs.”</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vigenère Cipher==
One of the most famous and simple polyalphabetic cipher is the Vigenere Cipher developed by Blaise de Vigenere in the 16th century. The Vigenère cipher operates in a manner similar to a [[../Caesar cipher/]], however, rather than shifting the plaintext character by a fixed value n, a keyword (or phrase) is chosen and the ordinal values of the characters in that keyword are used to determine the offset. The process that creates encrypted text is simple, but it was unbroken for 300 years.The system is so simple that the Vigenere encryption system has been discovered and rediscovered dozens of times.

For example, if the keyword is &quot;KEY&quot; and the plaintext is &quot;VIGENERE CIPHER,&quot; then first the key must be repeated so that it is the same length as the text (so key becomes keykeykeykeyke).  Next, the ordinal value of V (22) is shifted by the ordinal value of K (11) yielding F (6), the ordinal value of I (9) by the ordinal value of E (5) yielding M (13), etc. The keyword is repeated until the entire message is encrypted: 

&lt;pre&gt;
P: VIGENERECIPHER
K: KEYKEYKEYKEYKE
C: FMEORCBIASTFOV
&lt;/pre&gt;

An easier, but equivalent way of encrypting text is by writing out each letter of the alphabet and the key, and simply matching up the letters:

&lt;pre&gt;
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJ
EFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCD
YZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX
&lt;/pre&gt;

First The V in the first row would up with the F in the second.  Then, one would go down a row, and see that the I in the first row lines up with the M in the third.  After one reaches the bottom row, then they would continue lining up letters with the second row.  This uses exactly the same cipher, and is simply an easier method of performing the encryption when doing so by hand.

The Caesar cipher could be seen as a special case of the Vigenère cipher in which the chosen keyword is only a single character long.

An algorithmic way of expressing this cipher would be:

&lt;pre&gt;(plain_text_letter + (key_letter - 1)) mod 26 = cipher_text_letter&lt;/pre&gt;

=== GROMARK cipher ===

The Gronsfeld cipher is variation of Vigenere using a pseudo-random decimal key.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161-118991863961?journalCode=ucry20 &quot;The GROMARK cipher, and some relatives&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The cipher developed by Count Gronsfeld (Gronsfeld's cipher) was used throughout Europe.
It is enciphered and deciphered identically to the Vigenere cipher,
except the key is a block of decimal digits (repeated as necessary) shifting each plaintext character 0 to 9, rather than a block of letters (repeated as necessary) shifting each plaintext character 0 to 25.
It was more popular than the Vigenère cipher, despite its limitations.

An algorithmic way of expressing this cipher would be:&lt;ref&gt;

== running key cipher ==
{{Wikipedia | running key cipher}}
The running key cipher is a type of polyalphabetic substitution cipher in which a text, typically from a book, is used to provide a very long keystream. Usually, the book to be used would be agreed ahead of time, while the passage to use would be chosen randomly for each message and secretly indicated somewhere in the message.

A cryptanalyst will see peaks in the ciphertext letter distribution corresponding to letters that are formed when high-frequency plaintext letters are encrypted with high-frequency key text letters.&lt;ref&gt;
Sravana Reddy; Kevin Knight.
[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P12-2016 &quot;Decoding Running Key Ciphers&quot;].
2012.
&lt;/ref&gt;

If a cryptanalyst discovers two ciphertexts produced by (incorrectly) encrypting two different plaintext messages with the same &quot;one-time&quot; pad,
the cryptanalyst can combine those messages to produce a new ciphertext that is the same as using one of the original plaintext messages as a running key to encrypt the other original plaintext, then use techniques that decode running key ciphers to try to recover both plaintexts.

 What Character Is That? Chinese dictionary by Go Ping-Gam 

This dictionary is a Â¡Â°mustÂ¡Â± for all Americans who want to easily learn to read ,write and speak Chinese. To tour and work in mainland China, I needed a dictionary which would allow me, a non-native speaker, to read Chinese characters on maps, street signs, menus etc. I found all other Â¡Â°Chinese to EnglishÂ¡Â± dictionaries at bookstores in the USA totally useless to me. Why? They were organized phonetically by Chinese words in alphabetical order. This meant I had to already know Chinese to find out what the character meant! 
I was a Yale language major many years ago, joined the Foreign Service and taught English in Brazil. Several years ago, at age 64, I returned to my earlier profession and taught English in southern China. With the help of this extraordinary book, I was able to read and write letters in Chinese characters. It also helped me learn to speak Chinese at the basic level in both Mandarin and Cantonese dialects. I am now 66 years old and continue to learn. 

Recently I happily married a Chinese woman from Beijing who is only 50 years old. Without Mr.Gos books, I doubt that my new, great happiness in life would be possible. 

Customer Review #2: 

 A Quick, Easy Guide Worth the Money 

I was looking for a dictionary with maximum characters, and I found this one to be a great resource if you can pick out the character radical right away. Its much quicker than my other dictionary, and used in tandem with something like Oxfords Chinese Dictionary, it can cover all the bases of most characters you will encounter. My main need was a book that gave me less common characters used to transliterate foreign names and for characters that I couldnt find in my main dictionary. This book breaks down the radicals so simply that I think it makes them easier to learn as well. If you dont know the radical or cant easily identify it, I found I still needed the Oxford. As for the other reviewers who complained about the printing and the fact that it was self-published, I would recommend this book anyway because it doesnt look bad at all and the information is well worth the purchase. 

Customer Review #3: 

 The Best Chinese Dictionary for an english speaking person. 

I practically collect chinese dictionaries and books and this is the best book on the subject I own. Its the easiest dictionary to use for an english speaking person because its alphabetically arranged around the *english* names of the radicals and words.
If I would have to keep only one of my books and dictionaries, I would keep this one and I wouldnt miss a thing.

 The Perfect Dictionary For China, December 14, 2002 
 Reviewer: Matt (see more about me) from Portland, Oregon  
I took a quick course in conversational Chinese. Being a bad student, all I really learned was basic phrases and how to read pinyin. Suddenly I was offered a chance to go to Shanghai for two months to stay with a friend of my Chinese teacher. His friend ran a middle school and wanted an American to talk with the students. I agreed, but between the time I agreed and when I arrived in Shanghai, the agreement changed from talking with the students to teaching four hours of classes a day! Having very bad Chinese skills (almost none), this was a little daunting. I somehow managed to get through teaching 13 year-old Chinese students with only a few years of English training, even while I knew almost no Chinese. There is one main reason I was able to do this: Langenscheidt's Pocket Chinese Dictionary. This book saved me every day, and that is no exaggeration.

The book gives single words, but it also gives common phrases in which that word is used. The radical index is pretty good, though like others have said, it leaves some characters out. Most of the ones I couldn't find were (I discovered) local characters used mostly in the Shanghai area. When I was standing around trying to read signs, I often would consult this book. Since I had a conversation class, I didn't know how to read anything when I arrived. Once I was able to learn how to pick out a radical, though, I was usually able to find out what the word was just by using this dictionary. During class, when I had written an English word on the board and wanted to write the Chinese word, all I had to do was look up the English word in here. You not only will find the Chinese pinyin next to it, but also the character(s) for writing it. When I wanted to find something, I could do the same thing. Even if I didn't say the pinyin right, I could point to the characters in the book, and almost always people would immediately know what it was and would help me get it. 

Like others have said, the cover is rubbery, and stands up well to wear and tear. As I accidentally found out, this also means you can cover it with marker writings, or spill coffee and tea on the cover, yet it will wipe away clean. 

In the back of the book is a quick number section for dealing with all numbers, big and small. It also shows you the characters for writing numbers on checks, which are different than the characters for the regular use of numbers. 

The book also has the Chinese way of saying a lot of useful in-country phrases, like Communist Party, CCTV, People's Republic of China, and other things like that. It has slang and formal words in it, and covers thousands of words. I cannot believe how many things the dictionary has. I was teaching 13 year-olds, and like most kids that age, they wanted to know how to say some rather weird phrases in English. When they would write the Chinese, I could use the radical chart and look it up. Or, if they spoke it, I could find the pinyin using the Chinese side of the dictionary. I still cannot believe how many seemingly random words were in there. I'd say I could find any word (and I mean ANY word) about 95% of the time (one notable lack I found one day: &quot;caravan&quot; - can't have them all I guess). It is amazing.

I have put this book to the test. The sides of the pages are covered in dirt. The blue L on the front is slowly starting to wear off (not surprising after all I put it through). Physically, as well as language-wise, this book is great. I used it every day, flipping through and referencing it nearly non-stop. It has pulled me through every time. 

I've never really used another dictionary much, but I've never really had to. This one is great. If you are going to China and need a quick, handy, durable, and travel-friendly dictionary, this is what you want. Believe me, after two intense months of being one of the few English-speakers in a suburb of Shanghai, I know for a fact, this dictionary is good. Get it. You won't be disappointed. 

 OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD, August 17, 2002 
 Reviewer: A reader from Midwest  
I found this dictionary very help for beginning Mandarin. I thought I once bought a better dictionary but they are almost exactly the same. I reccomend this dictionary to anyone. 

 Probably The Best, Still Not Ideal., March 5, 2002 
 Reviewer: BENJAMIN GEORGE (see more about me) from Richmond, TX United States  
I've been studying Chinese in Suzhou (Jiangsu State) for about 4 months now, and of all the dictionaries I've bought this one has the most China-street-grime on it's pages. It is my everyday dictionary, I use it all the time. 

It's layout is nice and clean, no eye straining here, the character lookup uses a nice big font. I LOVE the tough rubber cover, it's nice and rugged. 

Wishlist:

1: A Traditional character lookup. 

2: A Stroke order index for characters with obscure radicals (the ABC Dictionary has this). Many of the very most common characters have very weird radicals. 

3: Markings for the different types of Chinese parts of speech, as a previous reviewer also noted, the parts of speech in Chinese are a little different. For example: &quot;tiaowu&quot; means &quot;to dance&quot;, but is it's &quot;le&quot; form &quot;tiaowule&quot; or &quot;tiaolewu&quot;? Help us out here folks, just mark it as a splittable verb. 

4: Update the vocab. When you wanna say &quot;cell phone&quot; you say &quot;shouji&quot;, but that's not the word they give, and in fact if you go to lookup &quot;shouji&quot; it's not there. All in all though this book has the most up to date lexicon of any of the dictionaries that I've seen. And like a previous reviewer said, it has all the words that other prudist editors leave out. 

5: More usage notes on the grammer type words, less on the nouns, I don't need usage notes for &quot;banana&quot; or whatever, but i would really like it if they told me how to use &quot;chule&quot; (kinda like &quot;unless&quot; but not exactly)

6: Mark which single character entires can be used alone and which must be used in combo with other characters. But for Pete's sake DON'T get rid of the single character entries, they are invaluble for learning Chinese, even if you can't use them on their own. More single character entries would be better.

7: Do a little more research on the frequency of words, I always end up sounding [bad] cause I use some stodgy word, while the dictionary doesn't even HAVE the common way to say it. 

8: Mark written-vs-spoken words. Chinese has a big split in the written and spoken languages. 

Hmm, everyday I think of other ways to improve this dictionary, but the fact that I use it everyday tells you something, the other dictionaries sit at home on my shelf. 

 very good over all but a few things missing, September 4, 2001 
 Reviewer: John Williams from Austin, TX USA  
This is the best Chinese dictionary I could find when I shopped around at several local bookstores. It covers simplified Chinese organized first by pinyin romanization and then by tones, which is generally helpful except when looking up multicharacter words because all entires starting with the same character do not always fall together.

The type face is very clear and easy to read and the entries are clearly laid out, presenting all the necessary information (including liberal usage notes) with no frills (such as pronunciation of English words, etc.) It is clearly designed more for English speakers than Chinese speakers. The vocabulary seems up to date (including, for instance, DVD) and also includes all the &quot;dirty&quot; words that prudish editors leave out. The book focuses on words used in mainland China but has a three-page appendix of Taiwanese equivalents of some terms.

I like the small size of this dictionary, and the plastic cover means it's probably durable enough to survive being carried around in a book bag quite a bit. My main gripe is that &quot;Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary&quot; spoiled me--I miss the character etymologies and having multiple indicies for looking up characters, but in practice the single radical index in this dictionary seems to work just as well if not better. I gave this dictionary four stars instead of five because I would have liked some treatment of traditional characters, an appendix listing measure words like in the compact Oxford dictionary, and information about parts of speech that more closely reflects Chinese grammar instead of just the standard English parts of speech. 

An excellent little dictionary, July 26, 2001 
 Reviewer: hbridge from New York, NY USA  
I bought this dictionary a month ago, in preparation for a trip to Beijing. Many people who study chinese are probably familiar with the &quot;little red&quot; chinese dictionary, this one is superior for a number of reasons.

First of all, the size is slightly wider and thinner, which is much less akward to carry around. 

Second, it's translations are usually more accurate; Time and time again have I looked a word up in english with other dictionaries, only to be scolded by my chinese teacher when the meaning wasn't quite right - this books example sentences are very... didao. 

Also, for someone who speaks less chinese this dictionary is far better because it is orgainized completely alphabetically by pinyin - not by pinyin then leading character. This could be annoying for someone who speaks the language (especially for writing), but for someone new to it, it's a blessing. The organization is the only reason i give it a 4, not a 5. 

 Langenscheidt is logical, May 8, 2001 
 Reviewer: z_simpsoncv (see more about me) from Auburn, Alabama USA  
I use this brand for latin and spanish as well. the dictionaries are laid out very logically and easy to understand. 

first half is eng to chinese and the second is chinese to eng. However until you know chinese pronouciation rules for pinyin. it is difficult to actually speak it for chinese people to understand you. How ever if you merely show them the characters that correspond to the word you looked up the people instantly know what you are trying to convey. Some of my friend who went with me on the trip bought dictionaries overthere but they are not as good.

Customer Reviews
A great addition to my collection, January 28, 2003
Reviewer: A reader from Seattle, WA USA
This book is one of my favorite Christmas presents! I've been interested in Chinese language for a number of years, and particularly in the written language and its history. I'm certain my Chinese friends have gotten tired of my questions: How did this evolve, when did this enter the language, why, etc. Now I own a book that will help me solve some of the puzzles. Very interesting, accurate, and fun to explore.

extremely useful, January 21, 2003
Reviewer: esseyo from Jersey City, NJ United States
The traditional way of ordering Chinese characters is so woefully inadequate and antiquated. It is so much easier to find the character you want using this dictionary. The typography is very nice and easy on my eyes.

The online version is a very handy supplement because you can click on any Chinese character in the entry and it will take you there (no more looking in the indices). Additionally the associated etymology tree is right there underneath (not on the next page or 3 pages back). Additionally for each character there is a link to the Cantonese pronunciation (.wav file) as well as various other dictionaries/db.

If you need more words, I suggest complementing this book with the FarEast Books' Chinese-English dictionary (one version in traditional, another in simplied (with traditional characters listed for reference but referred to as &quot;corrupt forms&quot;), and several pocket-size versions (but you shouldn't need to consider those)). It has much more depth than any other Chinese-English dictionaries you normally find.

Fascinating and Unique Approach for a Dictionary, September 2, 2002
Reviewer: professordavid from Zionsville, IN USA
Guess I should have gathered that from its title, but my initial mistake was thinking it was a traditional dictionary. I am now in my second year of learning Chinese. Two titles are indispensible, this one and the brief McNaughton one (revised, 1999). I continue to see increasing value in the Harbaugh approach: variable ways to find words and a thoroughly exhaustive entry on a word. As pointed out by other reviewers, entries include permutations of the word you are looking up with other words (in any order). Examining the genealogy helps you remember the character because of its origins, similar to McNaughton (but perhaps not with the humor that McNaughton displays occasionally).

On the down side, definitions don't give many contextual examples, so occasionally you might mis-use a word. This is a problem with any dictionary however, so I'm not sure it's a fair criticism.

Not to labor the point, this book dramatically improves with one's own knowledge of Chinese. It's remakably complete given its size and your ability to actually see the type.

I've used both the paper-edition and the online edition. I think the paper edition is easier to browse.

Now, if he only had an accompanying CD with all the words pronounced, I would be in heaven. But this book is a deal...

Great for searching and mnemonics; NOT accurate on origins, May 2, 2002
Reviewer: Kent Suarez from Taipei Taiwan
This a superb book for finding characters you don't know, when you only know one part of them (not necessarily the dictionary classifier, often mis-termed ¡§radical¡¨). It's also great as a mnemonic device, breaking characters down into their parts to help you learn them. The innovative organization into family trees teaches you the graphic relationships between the modern forms of the characters, although the reader should be forewarned that some of these relationships are spurious; they don't necessarily mean the characters originally had any relationship between them.

A caveat is in order: the so-called ¡§etymologies¡¨(explanations of character origins) in it are based on an out-of-date, 2000-year-old book, the Shuowen Jiezi. Some are even misreadings of Shuowen. Harbaugh unfortunately totally ignores the last hundred years' research based on oracle bones (Shang dynasty writings from ca 1300 BCE on turtle shells and livestock scapulae), which gives us a better picture of the true origins of the characters. While this was also a fatal problem with Wieger¡¦s Chinese Characters (and Wilder and Ingram¡¦s Analysis of Chinese Characters, which is a Wieger re-hashing), it is perhaps forgivable for Wieger, who began writing so soon after the oracle bones were found, around the turn of the 20th century. But it is much less forgivable for more recent authors like Harbaugh, and Tan Huay Peng, who did the Fun With Chinese Characters cartoon books (Straits Times Collection).

In fact, decent books on Chinese etymology are virtually non-existent. The best I¡¦ve found are Teresa L. Wu¡¦s out-of-print Origin and Dissemination of Chinese Characters (1990; Caves Books, Taipei ISBN 957-606-002-8; fairly good; if you find a used copy, snap it up!), and Xie Guanghui¡¦s fairly good and in-print Composition of Common Chinese Characters: An Illustrated Account (Peking (sic) University Press; ISBN 7-301-03329-x; 1997). I can't say I agree 100% with the etymologies in Wu and Xie, but they're as good as it gets, in English works. They both have examples of old forms for each character: Wu consistently has the oracle bone, bronze, seal, and clerical forms (hand-copied), while Xie tends to list fewer (but in facsimile).

No disparagement of Harbaugh is intended; his work fulfills admirably its goal as a tool for non-scholarly, graphically based character searches, and the etymologies in it are mnemonically useful. But it most definitely should NOT be 

relied on or trusted as a real reference on etymology.

Find a character with ease, March 15, 2002
Reviewer: solidoak from Pennsylvania &amp; Taiwan
What a cleverly designed book!
• Search by pinyin (romanization)
• Search by bopomofo (zhuyinfuhao)
• Search the English word list
• Search by THE PART OF THE CHARACTER YOU RECOGNIZE (doesn't have to be the radical)
• Or, ok, search by stroke or radical
• Another way to search, not mentioned in other reviews or even in the intro to the book itself: search by looking for a character that goes with the target character (i.e. I have no idea what this character is, but I just saw it printed right after the word for water. Fine, I'll just look up water, and there's my mystery character). And the definitions show plenty of combinations as well. After all, what is a zi (character) by itself?

With this book, you will not be squinting through row after row of tiny characters as with, say, the Far East brand dictionary. You can find a word or combination in seconds, I promise.

Focuses on &quot;traditional&quot; characters, as used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc, the same characters that have been used for the last 2000 years. Also, includes simplified form in brackets, which have been used in Mainland China for 50 years.

If you don't care about written Chinese, and you just want to look up what you hear, then John DeFrancis' ABC Dictionary is surely the book for you. (It has simplified characters searchable by pinyin combinations).

If you love Chinese writing, and long to look up every word you see, but are tired of asking your friend to explain it to you, then this book, 'Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary by Rick Harbaugh' is perfect.

One thing on the website which is missing from the book: reference numbers linking the character to Wieger's etymology, which (correctly or not) attempts to further explain a character's origins with samples of gu-wen (ancient writing).

Notice that this book currently takes 1-2 weeks to ship.

The best Chinese dictionary I've met so far!, February 16, 2002
Reviewer: sema
I do not speak Chinese, just use this book to read the legends on old money which I collect. It's also helpful when I have to read the coin catalogs in Chinese. Though I have some other dictionaries, this one is the best.

Easy to use even for a person who does not know Chinese!

This dictionary is great organized for searching the traditional characters, but it also gives simplified form for these characters.

Useful in some respects, February 7, 2002
Reviewer: mizhi from Easton, PA United States

I bought this book when I began studying the Chinese language and after I had become acquainted with the author's excellent website. Unfortunately, this book is mostly useful for students learning the traditional character set. It does include the simplified versions of characters; however, the layout and organization are heavily biased towards the traditional way of writing the characters. For those students who are learning the simplified way of writing characters (the set used by mainland China), I recommend the Concise English-Chinese Chinese-English Dictionary by Oxford University Press that can be found elseware on amazon.

This book is the most consisce ans efficent Chinese dictionary out there. due to it's layout it is perfect for memorizing characters, their roots, and meanings.

Most useful dictionary for a foreign student of Chinese, November 27, 2001
Reviewer: Christina Ng Bergstrom from New Orleans, LA United States
This dictionary is compact, so it is easy to carry in a bookbag or while travelling. But perhaps the most important part is that it is extremely easy to use. There are indexes to search for words via radicals, the bopomofo alphabet, total stroke number, pinyin, and english. Moreover, the dictionary is organized &quot;etymologically&quot;, that is, characters with similar stems are located together. For example, (if you're a student you may know these words) cheng-to become, cheng-honesty, cheng-city all have a common stem. They are all on the same page. I found this vastly interesting in terms of learning how characters were formed (each definition contains a brief etymological description). Additionally, by viewing easily mistakable words in this context I was better able to distinguish them later, and this process has given me a better understanding of the written language.

The particular organization of this dictionary also speeds up the process of finding words that I don't know. For example, say I didn't know the word cheng-honesty, but i recognize that it resembles cheng-to become. I can look up cheng-to become phonetically, find it in the dictionary and voila there is cheng-honesty. For someone unaccustomed to the seemingly impossible practice of searching via radicals, this method is extremely useful. I 

took this dictionary with me when I travelled in Asia. I highly recommend it.

HOW THE FIRST LETTER WAS WRITTEN

ONCE upon a most early time was a Neolithic man. He was not a
Jute or an Angle, or even a Dravidian, which he might well have
been, Best Beloved, but never mind why. He was a Primitive, and
he lived cavily in a Cave, and he wore very few clothes, and he
couldn't read and he couldn't write and he didn't want to, and
except when he was hungry he was quite happy. His name was
Tegumai Bopsulai, and that means, 'Man-who-does-not-put-his-foot-
forward-in-a-hurry'; but we, O Best Beloved, will call him
Tegumai, for short. And his wife's name was Teshumai Tewindrow,
and that means, 'Lady-who-asks-a-very-many-questions'; but we, O
Best Beloved, will call her Teshumai, for short. And his little
girl-daughter's name was Taffimai Metallumai, and that means,
'Small-person-without-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked'; but
I'm going to call her Taffy. And she was Tegumai Bopsulai's Best
Beloved and her own Mummy's Best Beloved, and she was not spanked
half as much as was good for her; and they were all three very
happy. As soon as Taffy could run about she went everywhere with
her Daddy Tegumai, and sometimes they would not come home to the
Cave till they were hungry, and then Teshumai Tewindrow would
say, 'Where in the world have you two been to, to get so shocking
dirty? Really, my Tegumai, you're no better than my Taffy.'

Now attend and listen!

One day Tegumai Bopsulai went down through the beaver-swamp to
the Wagai river to spear carp-fish for dinner, and Taffy went
too. Tegumai's spear was made of wood with shark's teeth at the
end, and before he had caught any fish at all he accidentally
broke it clean across by jabbing it down too hard on the bottom
of the river. They were miles and miles from home (of course they
had their lunch with them in a little bag), and Tegumai had
forgotten to bring any extra spears.

'Here's a pretty kettle of fish!' said Tegumai. 'It will take me
half the day to mend this.'

'There's your big black spear at home,' said Taffy. 'Let me run
back to the Cave and ask Mummy to give it me.'

'It's too far for your little fat legs,' said Tegumai. 'Besides,
you might fall into the beaver-swamp and be drowned. We must make
the best of a bad job.' He sat down and took out a little leather
mendy-bag, full of reindeer-sinews and strips of leather, and
lumps of bee's-wax and resin, and began to mend the spear.

Taffy sat down too, with her toes in the water and her chin in
her hand, and thought very hard. Then she said--'I say, Daddy,
it's an awful nuisance that you and I don't know how to write,
isn't it? If we did we could send a message for the new spear.'

'Taffy,' said Tegumai, 'how often have I told you not to use
slang? &quot;Awful&quot; isn't a pretty word, but it could be a
convenience, now you mention it, if we could write home.'

Just then a Stranger-man came along the river, but he belonged to
a far tribe, the Tewaras, and he did not understand one word of
Tegumai's language. He stood on the bank and smiled at Taffy,
because he had a little girl-daughter Of his own at home. Tegumai
drew a hank of deer-sinews from his mendy-bag and began to mend
his spear.

'Come here, said Taffy. 'Do you know where my Mummy lives?' And
the Stranger-man said 'Um!' being, as you know, a Tewara.

'Silly!' said Taffy, and she stamped her foot, because she saw a
shoal of very big carp going up the river just when her Daddy
couldn't use his spear.

'Don't bother grown-ups,' said Tegumai, so busy with his
spear-mending that he did not turn round.

'I aren't, said Taffy. 'I only want him to do what I want him to
do, and he won't understand.'

'Then don't bother me, said Tegumai, and he went on pulling and
straining at the deer-sinews with his mouth full of loose ends.
The Stranger-man--a genuine Tewara he was--sat down on the grass,
and Taffy showed him what her Daddy was doing. The Stranger-man
thought, this is a very wonderful child. She stamps her foot at
me and she makes faces. She must be the daughter of that noble
Chief who is so great that he won't take any notice of me.' So he
smiled more politely than ever.

'Now,' said Taffy, 'I want you to go to my Mummy, because your
legs are longer than mine, and you won't fall into the
beaver-swamp, and ask for Daddy's other spear--the one with the
black handle that hangs over our fireplace.'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, 'This is a very,
very wonderful child. She waves her arms and she shouts at me,
but I don't understand a word of what she says. But if I don't do
what she wants, I greatly fear that that haughty Chief,
Man-who-turns-his-back-on-callers, will be angry.' He got up and
twisted a big flat piece of bark off a birch-tree and gave it to
Taffy. He did this, Best Beloved, to show that his heart was as
white as the birch-bark and that he meant no harm; but Taffy
didn't quite understand.

'Oh!' said she. 'Now I see! You want my Mummy's living-address?
Of course I can't write, but I can draw pictures if I've anything
sharp to scratch with. Please lend me the shark's tooth off your
necklace.'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) didn't say anything, So
Taffy put up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and
seed and shark-tooth necklace round his neck.

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) thought, 'This is a very,
very, very wonderful child. The shark's tooth on my necklace is a
magic shark's tooth, and I was always told that if anybody
touched it without my leave they would immediately swell up or
burst, but this child doesn't swell up or burst, and that
important Chief, Man-who-attends-strictly-to-his-business, who
has not yet taken any notice of me at all, doesn't seem to be
afraid that she will swell up or burst. I had better be more
polite.'

So he gave Taffy the shark's tooth, and she lay down flat on her
tummy with her legs in the air, like some people on the
drawing-room floor when they want to draw pictures, and she said,
'Now I'll draw you some beautiful pictures! You can look over my
shoulder, but you mustn't joggle. First I'll draw Daddy fishing.
It isn't very like him; but Mummy will know, because I've drawn
his spear all broken. Well, now I'll draw the other spear that he
wants, the black-handled spear. It looks as if it was sticking in
Daddy's back, but that's because the shark's tooth slipped and
this piece of bark isn't big enough. That's the spear I want you
to fetch; so I'll draw a picture of me myself 'splaining to
you. My hair doesn't stand up like I've drawn, but it's easier to
draw that way. Now I'll draw you. I think you're very nice
really, but I can't make you pretty in the picture, so you
mustn't be 'fended. Are you 'fended?'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) smiled. He thought, 'There
must be a big battle going to be fought somewhere, and this
extraordinary child, who takes my magic shark's tooth but who
does not swell up or burst, is telling me to call all the great
Chief's tribe to help him. He is a great Chief, or he would have
noticed me.

'Look,' said Taffy, drawing very hard and rather scratchily, 'now
I've drawn you, and I've put the spear that Daddy wants into your
hand, just to remind you that you're to bring it. Now I'll show
you how to find my Mummy's living-address. You go along till you
come to two trees (those are trees), and then you go over a hill
(that's a hill), and then you come into a beaver-swamp all full
of beavers. I haven't put in all the beavers, because I can't
draw beavers, but I've drawn their heads, and that's all you'll
see of them when you cross the swamp. Mind you don't fall in!
Then our Cave is just beyond the beaver-swamp. It isn't as high
as the hills really, but I can't draw things very small. That's
my Mummy outside. She is beautiful. She is the most beautifullest
Mummy there ever was, but she won't be 'fended when she sees I've
drawn her so plain. She'll be pleased of me because I can draw.
Now, in case you forget, I've drawn the spear that Daddy wants
outside our Cave. It's inside really, but you show the picture to
my Mummy and she'll give it you. I've made her holding up her
hands, because I know she'll be so pleased to see you. Isn't it a
beautiful picture? And do you quite understand, or shall I
'splain again?'

The Stranger-man (and he was a Tewara) looked at the picture and
nodded very hard. He said to himself,' If I do not fetch this
great Chief's tribe to help him, he will be slain by his enemies
who are coming up on all sides with spears. Now I see why the
great Chief pretended not to notice me! He feared that his
enemies were hiding in the bushes and would see him. Therefore he
turned to me his back, and let the wise and wondetful child draw
the terrible picture showing me his difficulties. I will away and
get help for him from his tribe.' He did not even ask Taffy the
road, but raced off into the bushes like the wind, with
the birch-bark in his hand, and Taffy sat down most pleased.

Now this is the picture that Taffy had drawn for him!

'What have you been doing, Taffy?' said Tegumai. He had mended
his spear and was carefully waving it to and fro.

'It's a little berangement of my own, Daddy dear,' said Taffy.
'If you won't ask me questions, you'll know all about it in a
little time, and you'll be surprised. You don't know how
surprised you'll be, Daddy! Promise you'll be surprised.'

'Very well,' said Tegumai, and went on fishing.

The Stranger-man--did you know he was a Tewara?--hurried away
with the picture and ran for some miles, till quite by accident
he found Teshumai Tewindrow at the door of her Cave, talking to
some other Neolithic ladies who had come in to a Primitive lunch.
Taffy was very like Teshumai, especially about the upper part of
the face and the eyes, so the Stranger-man--always a pure
Tewara--smiled politely and handed Teshumai the birch-bark. He
had run hard, so that he panted, and his legs were scratched with
brambles, but he still tried to be polite.

As soon as Teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything
and flew at the Stranger-man. The other Neolithic ladies at once
knocked him down and sat on him in a long line of six, while
Teshumai pulled his hair.

'It's as plain as the nose on this Stranger-man's face,' she
said. 'He has stuck my Tegumai all full of spears, and frightened
poor Taffy so that her hair stands all on end; and not content
with that, he brings me a horrid picture of how it was done.
Look!' She showed the picture to all the Neolithic ladies sitting
patiently on the Stranger-man. 'Here is my Tegumai with his arm
broken; here is a spear sticking into his back; here is a man
with a spear ready to throw; here is another man throwing a spear
from a Cave, and here are a whole pack of people' (they were
Taffy's beavers really, but they did look rather like people)
'coming up behind Tegumai. Isn't it shocking!'

'Most shocking!' said the Neolithic ladies, and they filled the
Stranger-man's hair with mud (at which he was surprised), and
they beat upon the Reverberating Tribal Drums, and called
together all the chiefs of the Tribe of Tegumai, with their
Hetmans and Dolmans, all Neguses, Woons, and Akhoonds of the
organisation, in addition to the Warlocks, Angekoks, Juju-men,
Bonzes, and the rest, who decided that before they chopped the
Stranger-man's head off he should instantly lead them down to the
river and show them where he had hidden poor Taffy.

By this time the Stranger-man (in spite of being a Tewara) was
really annoyed. They had filled his hair quite solid with mud;
they had rolled him up and down on knobby pebbles; they had sat
upon him in a long line of six; they had thumped him and bumped
him till he could hardly breathe; and though he did not
understand their language, he was almost sure that the names the
Neolithic ladies called him were not ladylike. However, he said
nothing till all the Tribe of Tegumai were assembled, and then he
led them back to the bank of the Wagai river, and there they
found Taffy making daisy-chains, and Tegumai carefully spearing
small carp with his mended spear.

'Well, you have been quick!' said Taffy. 'But why did you bring
so many people? Daddy dear, this is my surprise. Are you
surprised, Daddy?'

'Very,' said Tegumai; 'but it has ruined all my fishing for the
day. Why, the whole dear, kind, nice, clean, quiet Tribe is here,
Taffy.'

And so they were. First of all walked Teshumai Tewindrow and the
Neolithic ladies, tightly holding on to the Stranger-man, whose
hair was full of mud (although he was a Tewara). Behind them came
the Head Chief, the Vice-Chief, the Deputy and Assistant Chiefs
(all armed to the upper teeth), the Hetmans and Heads of
Hundreds, Platoffs with their Platoons, and Dolmans with their
Detachments; Woons, Neguses, and Akhoonds ranking in the rear
(still armed to the teeth). Behind them was the Tribe in
hierarchical order, from owners of four caves (one for each
season), a private reindeer-run, and two salmon-leaps, to feudal
and prognathous Villeins, semi-entitled to half a bearskin of
winter nights, seven yards from the fire, and adscript serfs,
holding the reversion of a scraped marrow-bone under heriot
(Aren't those beautiful words, Best Beloved?). They were all
there, prancing and shouting, and they frightened every fish for
twenty miles, and Tegumai thanked them in a fluid Neolithic
oration.

Then Teshumai Tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged Taffy very
much indeed; but the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai took
Tegumai by the top-knot feathers and shook him severely.

'Explain! Explain! Explain!' cried all the Tribe of Tegumai.

'Goodness' sakes alive!' said Tegumai. 'Let go of my top-knot.
Can't a man break his carp-spear without the whole countryside
descending on him? You're a very interfering people.'

'I don't believe you've brought my Daddy's black-handled spear
after all,' said Taffy. 'And what are you doing to my nice
Stranger-man?'

They were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes
turned round and round. He could only gasp and point at Taffy.

'Where are the bad people who speared you, my darling?' said
Teshumai Tewindrow.

'There weren't any,' said Tegumai. 'My only visitor this morning
was the poor fellow that you are trying to choke. Aren't you
well, or are you ill, O Tribe of Tegumai?'

'He came with a horrible picture,' said the Head Chief,--'a
picture that showed you were full of spears.'

'Er-um-Pr'aps I'd better 'splain that I gave him that picture,'
said Taffy, but she did not feel quite comfy.

'You!' said the Tribe of Tegumai all together.
'Small-person-with-no-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked! You?'

'Taffy dear, I'm afraid we're in for a little trouble,' said her
Daddy, and put his arm round her, so she didn't care.

'Explain! Explain! Explain!' said the Head Chief of the Tribe of
Tegumai, and he hopped on one foot.

'I wanted the Stranger-man to fetch Daddy's spear, so I drawded
it,' said Taffy. 'There wasn't lots of spears. There was only one
spear. I drawded it three times to make sure. I couldn't help it
looking as if it stuck into Daddy's head--there wasn't room on
the birch-bark; and those things that Mummy called bad people are
my beavers. I drawded them to show him the way through the swamp;
and I drawded Mummy at the mouth of the Cave looking pleased
because he is a nice Stranger-man, and I think you are just the
stupidest people in the world,' said Taffy. 'He is a very nice
man. Why have you filled his hair with mud? Wash him!'

Nobody said anything at all for a longtime, till the Head Chief
laughed; then the Stranger-man (who was at least a Tewara)
laughed; then Tegumai laughed till he fell down flat on the bank;
then all the Tribe laughed more and worse and louder. The only
people who did not laugh were Teshumai Tewindrow and all the
Neolithic ladies. They were very polite to all their husbands,
and said 'Idiot!' ever so often.

Then the Head Chief of the Tribe of Tegumai cried and said and
sang, 'O
Small-person-with-out-any-manners-who-ought-to-be-spanked,
you've hit upon a great invention!'

'I didn't intend to; I only wanted Daddy's black-handled spear,'
said Taffy.

'Never mind. It is a great invention, and some day men will call
it writing. At present it is only pictures, and, as we have seen
to-day, pictures are not always properly understood. But a time
will come, O Babe of Tegumai, when we shall make letters--all
twenty-six of 'em,--and when we shall be able to read as well as
to write, and then we shall always say exactly what we mean
without any mistakes. Let the Neolithic ladies wash the mud out
of the stranger's hair.'

'I shall be glad of that,' said Taffy, 'because, after all,
though you've brought every single other spear in the Tribe of
Tegumai, you've forgotten my Daddy's black-handled spear.'

Then the Head Chief cried and said and sang, 'Taffy dear, the
next time you write a picture-letter, you'd better send a man who
can talk our language with it, to explain what it means. I don't
mind it myself, because I am a Head Chief, but it's very bad for
the rest of the Tribe of Tegumai, and, as you can see, it
surprises the stranger.'

Then they adopted the Stranger-man (a genuine Tewara of Tewar)
into the Tribe of Tegumai, because he was a gentleman and did not
make a fuss about the mud that the Neolithic ladies had put into
his hair. But from that day to this (and I suppose it is all
Taffy's fault), very few little girls have ever liked learning to
read or write. Most of them prefer to draw pictures and play
about with their Daddies--just like Taffy.


THERE runs a road by Merrow Down--
  A grassy track to-day it is
An hour out of Guildford town,
  Above the river Wey it is.

Here, when they heard the horse-bells ring,
  The ancient Britons dressed and rode
To watch the dark Phoenicians bring
  Their goods along the Western Road.

And here, or hereabouts, they met
  To hold their racial talks and such--
To barter beads for Whitby jet,
  And tin for gay shell torques and such.

But long and long before that time
  (When bison used to roam on it)
Did Taffy and her Daddy climb
  That down, and had their home on it.

Then beavers built in Broadstone brook
  And made a swamp where Bramley stands:
And hears from Shere would come and look
  For Taffimai where Shamley stands.

The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai,
  Was more than six times bigger then;
And all the Tribe of Tegumai
  They cut a noble figure then!




HOW THE ALPHABET WAS MADE

THE week after Taffimai Metallumai (we will still call her Taffy,
Best Beloved) made that little mistake about her Daddy's spear
and the Stranger-man and the picture-letter and all, she went
carp-fishing again with her Daddy. Her Mummy wanted her to stay
at home and help hang up hides to dry on the big drying-poles
outside their Neolithic Cave, but Taffy slipped away down to her
Daddy quite early, and they fished. Presently she began to
giggle, and her Daddy said, 'Don't be silly, child.'

'But wasn't it inciting!' said Taffy. 'Don't you remember how the
Head Chief puffed out his cheeks, and how funny the nice
Stranger-man looked with the mud in his hair?'

'Well do I,' said Tegumai. 'I had to pay two deerskins--soft ones
with fringes--to the Stranger-man for the things we did to him.'

'We didn't do anything,' said Taffy. 'It was Mummy and the other
Neolithic ladies--and the mud.'

'We won't talk about that,' said her Daddy, 'Let's have lunch.'

Taffy took a marrow-bone and sat mousy-quiet for ten whole
minutes, while her Daddy scratched on pieces of birch-bark with a
shark's tooth. Then she said, 'Daddy, I've thinked of a secret
surprise. You make a noise--any sort of noise.'

'Ah!' said Tegumai. 'Will that do to begin with?'

'Yes,' said Taffy. 'You look just like a carp-fish with its mouth
open. Say it again, please.'

'Ah! ah! ah!' said her Daddy. 'Don't be rude, my daughter.'

'I'm not meaning rude, really and truly,' said Taffy. 'It's part
of my secret-surprise-think. Do say ah, Daddy, and keep your
mouth open at the end, and lend me that tooth. I'm going to draw
a carp-fish's mouth wide-open.'

'What for?' said her Daddy.

'Don't you see?' said Taffy, scratching away on the bark. 'That
will be our little secret s'prise. When I draw a carp-fish with
his mouth open in the smoke at the back of our Cave--if Mummy
doesn't mind--it will remind you of that ah-noise. Then we can
play that it was me jumped out of the dark and s'prised you with
that noise--same as I did in the beaver-swamp last winter.'

'Really?' said her Daddy, in the voice that grown-ups use when
they are truly attending. 'Go on, Taffy.'

'Oh bother!' she said. 'I can't draw all of a carp-fish, but I
can draw something that means a carp-fish's mouth. Don't you know
how they stand on their heads rooting in the mud? Well, here's a
pretence carp-fish (we can play that the rest of him is drawn).
Here's just his mouth, and that means ah.' And she drew this. 
(1.)

'That's not bad,' said Tegumai, and scratched on his own piece of
bark for himself; but you've forgotten the feeler that hangs
across his mouth.'

'But I can't draw, Daddy.'

'You needn't draw anything of him except just the opening of his
mouth and the feeler across. Then we'll know he's a carp-fish,
'cause the perches and trouts haven't got feelers. Look here,
Taffy.' And he drew this. (2.)

'Now I'll copy it.' said Taffy. 'Will you understand this when
you see it?'

'Perfectly,' said her Daddy.

And she drew this. (3.) 'And I'll be quite as s'prised when I see
it anywhere, as if you had jumped out from behind a tree and said
'&quot;Ah!&quot;'

'Now, make another noise,' said Taffy, very proud.

'Yah!' said her Daddy, very loud.

'H'm,' said Taffy. 'That's a mixy noise. The end part is
ah-carp-fish-mouth; but what can we do about the front part? Yer-
yer-yer and ah! Ya!'

'It's very like the carp-fish-mouth noise. Let's draw another
bit of the carp-fish and join 'em,' said her Daddy. He was quite
incited too.

'No. If they're joined, I'll forget. Draw it separate. Draw his
tail. If he's standing on his head the tail will come first.
'Sides, I think I can draw tails easiest,' said Taffy.

'A good notion,' said Tegumai. &quot;Here's a carp-fish tail for the
yer-noise.' And he drew this. (4.)

'I'll try now,' said Taffy. ''Member I can't draw like you,
Daddy. Will it do if I just draw the split part of the tail, and
the sticky-down line for where it joins?' And she drew this. (5.)

Her Daddy nodded, and his eyes were shiny bright with 'citement.

'That's beautiful,' she said. 'Now make another noise, Daddy.'

'Oh!' said her Daddy, very loud.

'That's quite easy,' said Taffy. 'You make your mouth all around
like an egg or a stone. So an egg or a stone will do for that.'

'You can't always find eggs or stones. We'll have to scratch a
round something like one.' And he drew this. (6.)

'My gracious!' said Taffy, 'what a lot of noise-pictures we've
made,--carp-mouth, carp-tail, and egg! Now, make another noise,
Daddy.'

'Ssh!' said her Daddy, and frowned to himself, but Taffy was too
incited to notice.

'That's quite easy,' she said, scratching on the bark.

'Eh, what?' said her Daddy. 'I meant I was thinking, and didn't
want to be disturbed.'

'It's a noise just the same. It's the noise a snake makes,
Daddy, when it is thinking and doesn't want to be disturbed. 
Let's make the ssh-noise a snake. Will this do?' And she drew
this. (7.)

'There,' she said. 'That's another s'prise-secret. When you draw
a hissy-snake by the door of your little back-cave where you mend
the spears, I'll know you're thinking hard; and I'll come in most
mousy-quiet. And if you draw it on a tree by the river when you
are fishing, I'll know you want me to walk most most mousy-quiet,
so as not to shake the banks.'

'Perfectly true,' said Tegumai. And there's more in this game
than you think. Taffy, dear, I've a notion that your Daddy's
daughter has hit upon the finest thing that there ever was since
the Tribe of Tegumai took to using shark's teeth instead of
flints for their spear-heads. I believe we've found out the big
secret of the world.'

'Why?' said Taffy, and her eyes shone too with incitement.

'I'll show,' said her Daddy. 'What's water in the Tegumai
language?'

'Ya, of course, and it means river too--like Wagai-ya--the Wagai
river.'

'What is bad water that gives you fever if you drink 
it--black water--swamp-water?'

'Yo, of course.'

'Now look,' said her Daddy. 'S'pose you saw this scratched by the
side of a pool in the beaver-swamp?' And he drew this. (8.)

'Carp-tail and round egg. Two noises mixed! Yo, bad water,'
said Taffy. ''Course I wouldn't drink that water because I'd
know you said it was bad.'

'But I needn't be near the water at all. I might be miles away,
hunting, and still--'

'And still it would be just the same as if you stood there and
said, &quot;G'way, Taffy, or you'll get fever.&quot; All that in a
carp-fish-tail and a round egg! O Daddy, we must tell Mummy,
quick!' and Taffy danced all round him.

'Not yet,' said Tegumai; 'not till we've gone a little further.
Let's see. Yo is bad water, but So is food cooked on the fire,
isn't it?' And he drew this. (9.)

'Yes. Snake and egg,' said Taffy 'So that means dinner's ready.
If you saw that scratched on a tree you'd know it was time to
come to the Cave. So'd I.'

'My Winkie!' said Tegumai. 'That's true too. But wait a minute. 
I see a difficulty. SO means &quot;come and have dinner,&quot; but sho
means the drying-poles where we hang our hides.'

'Horrid old drying-poles!' said Taffy. 'I hate helping to hang
heavy, hot, hairy hides on them. If you drew the snake and egg,
and I thought it meant dinner, and I came in from the wood and
found that it meant I was to help Mummy hang the two hides on the
drying-poles, what would I do?'

'You'd be cross. So'd Mummy. We must make a new picture for sho.
We must draw a spotty snake that hisses sh-sh, and we'll play
that the plain snake only hisses ssss.'

'I couldn't be sure how to put in the spots,' said Taffy. 'And
p'raps if you were in a hurry you might leave them out, and I'd
think it was so when it was sho, and then Mummy would catch me
just the same. No! I think we'd better draw a picture of the
horrid high drying-poles their very selves, and make quite sure.
I'll put them in just after the hissy-snake. Look!' And she
drew this. (10.)

'P'raps that's safest. It's very like our drying-poles, anyhow,'
said her Daddy, laughing. 'Now I'll make a new noise with a
snake and drying-pole sound in it. I'll say shi. That's Tegumai
for spear, Taffy.' And he laughed.

'Don't make fun of me,' said Taffy, as she thought of her
picture-letter and the mud in the Stranger-man's hair. 'You draw
it, Daddy.'

'We won't have beavers or hills this time, eh?' said her Daddy,
'I'll just draw a straight line for my spear.' and he drew this.
(11.)

'Even Mummy couldn't mistake that for me being killed.'

'Please don't, Daddy. It makes me uncomfy. Do some more noises.
We're getting on beautifully.'

'Er-hm!' said Tegumai, looking up. 'We'll say shu. That means
sky.'

Taffy drew the snake and the drying-pole. Then she stopped. 'We
must make a new picture for that end sound, mustn't we?'

'Shu-shu-u-u-u!' said her Daddy. 'Why, it's just like the
round-egg-sound made thin.'

'Then s'pose we draw a thin round egg, and pretend it's a frog
that hasn't eaten anything for years.'

'N-no,' said her Daddy. 'If we drew that in a hurry we might
mistake it for the round egg itself. Shu-shu-shu! 'I tell you
what we'll do. We'll open a little hole at the end of the round
egg to show how the O-noise runs out all thin, ooo-oo-oo. Like
this.' And he drew this. (12.)

'Oh, that's lovely ! Much better than a thin frog. Go on,' said
Taffy, using her shark's tooth. Her Daddy went on drawing, and
his hand shook with incitement. He went on till he had drawn
this. (13.)

'Don't look up, Taffy,' he said. 'Try if you can make out what
that means in the Tegumai language. If you can, we've found the
Secret.'

'Snake--pole--broken--egg--carp--tail and carp-mouth,' said
Taffy. 'Shu-ya. Sky-water (rain).' Just then a drop fell on her
hand, for the day had clouded over. 'Why, Daddy, it's raining.
Was that what you meant to tell me?'

'Of course,' said her Daddy. 'And I told it you without saying a
word, didn't I?'

'Well, I think I would have known it in a minute, but that
raindrop made me quite sure. I'll always remember now. Shu-ya
means rain, or &quot;it is going to rain.&quot; Why, Daddy!' She gotup and
danced round him. 'S'pose you went out before I was awake, and
drawed shu-ya in the smoke on the wall, I'd know it was going to
rain and I'd take my beaver-skin hood. Wouldn't Mummy be
surprised?'

Tegumai got up and danced. (Daddies didn't mind doing those
things in those days.) 'More than that! More than that!' he said.
'S'pose I wanted to tell you it wasn't going to rain much and you
must come down to the river, what would we draw? Say the words
in Tegumai-talk first.'

'Shu-ya-las, ya maru. (Sky-water ending. River come to.) what a
lot of new sounds! I don't see how we can draw them.'

'But I do--but I do!' said Tegumai. 'Just attend a minute, Taffy,
and we won't do any more to-day. We've got shu-ya all right,
haven't we? But this las is a teaser. La-la-la' and he waved his
shark-tooth.

'There's the hissy-snake at the end and the carp-mouth before the
snake--as-as-as. We only want la-la,' said Taffy.

'I know it, but we have to make la-la. And we're the first people
in all the world who've ever tried to do it, Taffimai!'

'Well,' said Taffy, yawning, for she was rather tired. 'Las
means breaking or finishing as well as ending, doesn't it?'

'So it does,' said Tegumai. 'To-las means that there's no water
in the tank for Mummy to cook with--just when I'm going hunting,
too.'

'And shi-las means that your spear is broken. If I'd only thought
of that instead of drawing silly beaver pictures for the
Stranger!'

'La! La! La!' said Tegumai, waiving his stick and frowning. 'Oh
bother!'

'I could have drawn shi quite easily,' Taffy went on. 'Then I'd
have drawn your spear all broken--this way!' And she drew. (14.)

'The very thing,' said Tegumai. 'That's la all over. It isn't
like any of the other marks either.' And he drew this. (15.)

'Now for ya. Oh, we've done that before. Now for maru.
Mum-mum-mum. Mum shuts one's mouth up, doesn't it? We'll draw a
shut mouth like this.' And he drew. (16.)

'Then the carp-mouth open. That makes Ma-ma-ma! But what about
this rrrrr-thing, Taffy?'

'It sounds all rough and edgy, like your shark-tooth saw when
you're cutting out a plank for the canoe,' said Taffy.

'You mean all sharp at the edges, like this?' said Tegumai. And
he drew. (17.)

''Xactly,' said Taffy. 'But we don't want all those teeth: only
put two.'

'I'll only put in one,' said Tegumai. 'If this game of ours is
going to be what I think it will, the easier we make our sound-
pictures the better for everybody.' And he drew. (18.)

'Now, we've got it,' said Tegumai, standing on one leg. 'I'll
draw 'em all in a string like fish.'

'Hadn't we better put a little bit of stick or something between
each word, so's they won't rub up against each other and jostle,
same as if they were carps?'

'Oh, I'll leave a space for that,' said her Daddy. And very
incitedly he drew them all without stopping, on a big new bit of
birch-bark. (19.)

'Shu-ya-las ya-maru,' said Taffy, reading it out sound by sound.


'That's enough for to-day,' said Tegumai. 'Besides, you're
getting tired, Taffy. Never mind, dear. We'll finish it all to-
morrow, and then we'll be remembered for years and years after
the biggest trees you can see are all chopped up for firewood.'

So they went home, and all that evening Tegumai sat on one side
of the fire and Taffy on the other, drawing ya's and yo's and
shu's and shi's in the smoke on the wall and giggling together
till her Mummy said, 'Really, Tegumai, you're worse than my
Taffy.'

'Please don't mind,' said Taffy. 'It's only our 
secret-s'prise, Mummy dear, and we'll tell you all about it the
very minute it's done; but please don't ask me what it is now, or
else I'll have to tell.'

So her Mummy most carefully didn't; and bright and early next
morning Tegumai went down to the river to think about new sound
pictures, and when Taffy got up she saw Ya-las (water is ending
or running out) chalked on the side of the big stone water-tank,
outside the Cave.

'Um,' said Taffy. 'These picture-sounds are rather a bother!
Daddy's just as good as come here himself and told me to get more
water for Mummy to cook with.' She went to the spring at the back
of the house and filled the tank from a bark bucket, and then she
ran down to the river and pulled her Daddy's left ear--the one
that belonged to her to pull when she was good.

'Now come along and we'll draw all the left-over sound-pictures,'
said her Daddy, and they had a most inciting day of it, and a
beautiful lunch in the middle, and two games of romps. When they
came to T, Taffy said that as her name, and her Daddy's, and her
Mummy's all began with that sound, they should draw a sort of
family
group of themselves holding hands. That was all very well to draw
once or twice; but when it came to drawing it six or seven
times, Taffy and Tegumai drew it scratchier and scratchier, till
at last the T-sound was only a thin long Tegumai with his arms
out to hold Taffy and Teshumai. You can see from these three
pictures partly how it happened. (20, 21, 22.)

Many of the other pictures were much too beautiful to begin with,
especially before lunch, but as they were drawn over and over
again on birch-bark, they became plainer and easier, till at last
even Tegumai said he could find no fault with them. They turned
the hissy-snake the other way round for the Z-sound, to show it
was hissing backwards in a soft and gentle way (23); and they
just made a twiddle for E, because it came into the pictures so
often (24); and they drew pictures of the sacred Beaver of the
Tegumais for the B-sound (25, 26, 27, 28); and because it was a
nasty, nosy noise, they just drew noses for the N-sound, till
they were tired (29); and they drew a picture of the big
lake-pike's
mouth for the greedy Ga-sound (30); and they drew the pike's
mouth
again with a spear behind it for the scratchy, hurty Ka-sound
(31);
and they drew pictures of a little bit of the winding Wagai river
for the nice windy-windy Wa-sound (32, 33); and so on and so
forth
and so following till they had done and drawn all the
sound-pictures
that they wanted, and there was the Alphabet, all complete.

And after thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and
after Hieroglyphics and Demotics, and Nilotics, and Cryptics, and
Cufics, and Runics, and Dorics, and Ionics, and all sorts of
other ricks and tricks (because the Woons, and the Neguses, and
the Akhoonds, and the Repositories of Tradition would never leave
a good thing alone when they saw it), the fine old easy,
understandable Alphabet--A, B, C, D, E, and the rest of 'em--got
back into its proper shape again for all Best Beloveds to learn
when they are old enough.

But I remember Tegumai Bopsulai, and Taffimai Metallumai and
Teshumai Tewindrow, her dear Mummy, and all the days gone by. And
it was so--just so--a little time ago--on the banks of the big
Wagai!

OF all the Tribe of Tegumai
  Who cut that figure, none remain,--
On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry
  The silence and the sun remain.

But as the faithful years return
  And hearts unwounded sing again,
Comes Taffy dancing through the fern
  To lead the Surrey spring again.

Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds,
  And golden elf-locks fly above;
Her eyes are bright as diamonds
  And bluer than the skies above.

In mocassins and deer-skin cloak,
  Unfearing, free and fair she flits,
And lights her little damp-wood smoke
  To show her Daddy where she flits.

For far--oh, very far behind,
  So far she cannot call to him,
Comes Tegumai alone to find
  The daughter that was all to him.</text>

The Alphabet is Historic: The Phoenicians and the Beginnings of the Alphabet
Lesson One of Curriculum Unit:

The Alphabet is Historic

Introduction

Our first lesson will be about the Phoenicians, who invented the alphabet inherited by the Greeks, Romans, and eventually, us. 

Guiding Questions:
Who were the Phoenicians and where did they live?
When and why did they invent the alphabet? 
What did their alphabet look like? 
Can we see some early forms of our own letters in this very old alphabet? 

Learning Objectives:
After completing this lesson students will be able to: 
Describe the Phoenicians as a trading people who lived long ago on the shores of the Mediterranean. 
Understand that the Phoenicians invented the first form of our alphabet. 
Say why the alphabet was important for the Phoenicians. 
Compare some of the Phoenician letters to our letters. 
Write a short paragraph (with the teacher or alone) on a topic related to learning or using the Phoenician alphabet. 

Preparing to teach the lesson: 
The Phoenician Alphabet

A short narrative description of the Phoenicians is included below. You could use it, together with the maps and illustrations provided, to introduce your students to the Phoenicians. In order to do the activities outlined here you will need to download or project the The Phoenician World and the The NEH Phoenician Alphabet Page.

Other useful maps may be found at A Bequest Unearthed, Phoenicia. Click on “The Phoenician World with Cities “ and &quot;Phoenician Land and Sea Voyages&quot;. Images of Phoenician ships can be also be downloaded at this site. 

Project or Show the map of the Mediterranean as you introduce the Phoenicians. 

Historical Introduction: 
The Phoenicians were a trading people who came from the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Their two main cities were Sidon and Tyre. They had very wonderful ships, built with timber from Lebanon, and they traded in all sorts of good things: metals, cloth, purple dye, fine jewelry and craft work, salt, wine and olives, grain, and many other things. The Phoenicians were sailors and city dwellers, and as they grew more and more prosperous and populous they did not spread out into the land as other people might. Rather, they founded many new cities, or colonies, all around the Mediterranean Sea. Be sure to show your students that some of these colonies were as distant from Phoenicia as the southern coast of Spain. You could also point out Carthage, in North Africa. Carthage was the most famous of the Phoenician colonies. It became a very powerful city, and later on in time it became Rome's adversary in a battle for dominance over the western Mediterranean. 

Two Activities based on the Phoenician Alphabet
Phoenician Alphabet Activity: Speak about the Phoenicians' extensive trading all around the Mediterranean and show your students some pictures of the Phoenician ships. 
Now use your map to show the students Tyre and Athens, Greece. (We'll be using Athens again in the Greek part of the unit.) Ask the children to pretend that they are Phoenician merchants trading purple cloth from Tyre for olive oil from Athens. They are stationed at Athens, and they must stay there to continue with their business. But they must also report back to Tyre about how much they've sold and what new supplies they will need. How will they send the message? (Answer: They will have to send a letter, probably with the next ship.) 
Then ask the students if the Phoenician traders could write a letter if they didn't have an alphabet. Using the NEH Phoenician Alphabet page the teacher could show the students the Phoenician alphabet. S/he could say something like: &quot;Three thousand years ago, when the ancient Phoenicians wrote letters, this is the alphabet they used.&quot; Do the children recognize any of the old Phoenician letters? Several are easy to recognize once you see that the form is slightly different from what we are used to. 
Point out that A and S, for instance, are nearly the same as they are now, except that they are lying sideways [&quot;S&quot; is the second to last letter of this alphabet]. 
Again, the teacher could show the students that O looks just the same now as it did three thousand years ago, and so does T. 
Encourage your students to draw further comparisons. (Ask about the letters in the “D” and “E” position, for instance. Do they look somewhat familiar?)

Congratulate the children on being able to identify letters that are about 3,000 years old and come from a different language! Let the children count the letters and copy some of the strange ones. They'll see that this first alphabet has fewer letters than ours, and they will notice many other differences. 

You could talk with the class about how things change form and appearance as they develop. For instance, you could ask the children if they think that they will look the same when they are 12, or when they're grown up, as they do now. Just like people, the alphabet changes its appearance over time. 

Possible assignments: 
Ask the children to write (or write with them) a short story or descriptive paragraph about a Phoenician child who is learning the alphabet. 
Alternatively, write with them, or ask them to write, the letter the Phoenicians traders wrote back to Tyre. They could tell about their success at Athens and request more things to sell. 
Assessment Activity:
Conclude the lesson by asking the children to identify Phoenicia and the Mediterranean Sea on the map. Can the children trace the route from Tyre to Athens? Can they show the Phoenician colonies? Ask the children what sorts of things the Phoenicians loaded onto their boats to trade. 

Finally, ask the children who invented the alphabet that would someday become our alphabet. Why would a trading people need an alphabet? Can they remember some of the letters the Phoenicians invented that we still use? 

Extending the Lesson: 
If any of your students suggested that it might be just as easy to write with pictures, there are two wonderful Just So stories by Rudyard Kipling—through the EDSITEment-reviewed Internet Public Library—that show in a very amusing way why it is so important to have letters. They are called &quot;How the First Letter was Written&quot; and &quot;How the First Alphabet was Made&quot;. They would also be available in any collection of Kipling's stories for children.

Living Phoenicians
Who is Phoenician and who is Arab today? 
“The invaders of Phoenicia NEVER REPLACED the original population even when they added to their genetic diversity.”

“Are we arab? Are we Phoenician?”

“The majority come from the original Phoenicians who speak a language (or dialect) which is a mixture of Syriac, Aramaic, Turkish, and colloquial Arabic, as well as a some other languages.”
 
 Multicultural, Multiethnic, Poly-religious, Poly-sectarian Middle East and the Need for Tolerance 
Political Statement:
The tensions and turmoils that continue to haunt the world cannot be solved without genuine will for coexistance, tolerance and peaceful dialogue. The complex makeup of minorities from all religions, sects, ethnic or cultural groups of the Near East must be allowed free expression of their unique characteristics, traditons and cultures within the accepted freedoms of the civilized world. Such communities should be protected from persecution, extermination, intimidation or subordination by majorities that choose to employ religious laws that infringe on the human rights of others. The multicultural, multiethnic, poly-religious and poly-sectarian communities of this part of the world must exercise extreme caution in preserving the uniquness of their diverse society which is the corner stone in enriching their part of the world. 

 Religion and Culture
A MUST SEE:

After the Arab invasion of the Middle East in the 7th Century and the enforced conversion of most of the population to Islam, the cultures of the various peoples under this occupation became diluted into the new order. However, ancient cultures survived in the rites of various churches of the East. The mosaic of religions in the Middle East became the repository of culture while the unique identities of the peoples of that part of the Mediterranean was changed for ever. For example, the Assyrian Church and Chaldean Church (or see &quot;Who are the Chaldeans&quot;) in Iraq, Georgia, Persia, and Turkey preserved the cultures of the ancient Assyrians and Babylonians; the Coptic Church in Egypt preserved the culture of Pharaonic Egypt; the Syriac Orthodox Church, (whose Patriach Ignatius Khalaf 1455-1483 may have been my ancestor; see also Suryoyo) -- relative to Syriac language, dialect of Aramaic -- in Syria, Lebanon, Persia and Iraq preserved the culture of the Syrian Jacobites/Phoenicians; the Greco-Phoenician of the Byzantine Church (or see The History of Melkites in this site and Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East and Greek Catholic Melkite Patriarchate of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria and All the East in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Egypt and Israel/Palestine preserved the Greek Byzantine culture; and the Maronite Church in Lebanon, Syria, Israel/Palestine, and Cyprus preserved the culture of the Phoenicians. Several of the aforesaid churches are or have sister easter Catholic rites churches which did separate from their original churches and came in communion with the Papacy (see Opus Libani) while the others remained in their Eastern Orthodox tradition. Further, all of these churches and their cultures have immigrant branches all over the world. For a detailed list of links about the various peoples and churches mentioned herewith, please refer to &quot;Related resources and links about Phoenicia and the Forgotten Christians of the East&quot; (Related Links About Phoenicia) on this website.

It must be noted, in this brief summary, that a predominent majority of the Phoenician Christian community which resided in cities of Phoenicia Maritima became Byzantinized or took on &quot;western&quot; Byzantine customes, dress, rites and liturgy. Meanwhile, Phoenician communities of the mountains, which were cut off from contact with the outside world, maintained a more authentic Phoenician Maronite and Syriac traditions, customes, rites, language and culture.

Byzantine Psaltica Chants 
During ceremonial Holy Liturgy, chants honoring Lebanese bishops and archbishops continue to be recited to this day proclaiming them &quot;Metropolitan Archbishops of Phoenicia Maritima.&quot; 

Following are translations of the text of two of these Byzantine chants, as well as link to their MP3 audio files.

Archbishop of Beirut, specifically composed and written to the late Metropolitan Archbishop Eliya Saleebi:

&quot;Father of fathers and shepherd of shepherds, Eliya, most virtuously righteous and most honorable, who is appointed by God as bishop of Beirut and its suburbs. He who is most revered in graciousness and who is most preeminent in leadership, Metropolitan of Phoenicia Maritima. Our father and archbishop, may his years be many.&quot; (performed with difficulty by the author* of this site) (MP3 file Beirut)

* I used to hear this chant when I went to Holy Liturgy at the Orthodox Monastery in my hometown when archbishop Eliya Saleebi was the celebrant. I am not absolutely sure of the right words but I believe I got the hymnology as close to the original as I can remember.

Archbishop of Tripoli, specifically composed and written to the Metropolitan Archbishop Elias:

&quot;May God the Lord Almighty keep for many years, his beatitude and most revered graciousness, Metropolitan of Tripoli and all of Phoenicia Maritima, our father and our master, Kyrios Elias. God keep for many years.&quot; (performer unknown) (MP3 file, Tripoli)

Who is Arab? The origin of the word &quot;Arab&quot;
Hitherto, the first actual use of the word Arab in history is to be found in an Assyrian inscription of 853 B.C., commemorating the defeat of a mutinous chieftain, called Gindibu the Aribi during the reign of king Shalmaneser III (858-824 B.C.). Arabs are then mentioned quite often, until the 6th century B.C. as Aribi or Arabuthat indicates a vassalage to the Assyrians. The first Greek who is accredited to have acquired some geographical knowledge was Homer, who flourished in 1000 or 800 B.C. He has referred to the Syrians under the name Arimi (the Biblical, Aram) and the Arabs under the name of Erembi. The place-name Arabia occurs for the first time in Greek writings. Herodotus (484-425 B.C,), followed by most other Greek and Latin writers, extended the term Arabia and Arab to the whole peninsula and everything in it, even including the eastern desert of Egypt between the Red Sea and the Nile. References to the Arabs, in addition, are also found in the anonymous &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (between 95 A.D. and 130 A.C.). The word Saracen, first used in Greek literature too, is a transcription of an Arabic word meaning &quot;easterner.&quot; As for the Arabs' use of the word, it occurs for the first time in the ancient epigraphical material originating in southern Arabia, where it is clearly used for Bedouin. In the north, the word is used firstly in the 4th century A.D., in one of the oldest surviving records of the language that became classical Arabic. 

Further account of the Arabs comes in the 10th chapter of Genesis of the Old Testament, which names the descendants of Noah, whose elder son, Shem is regarded as the ancestor of the Hebrews, Arabs and Armaens, - the speakers of Semitic language. But the term Arabs is not explicitly mentioned in Genesis. It is however suggested that the &quot;mixed multitude&quot; (Hebrew, erev) mentioned in Exodus (xii, 38) as having accompanied the Israelites into the wanderness from Egypt may be for Arabs. According to &quot;Dictionary of the Bible&quot; (ed. by James Hastings, New York, 1898, 1st vol., p. 135), &quot;The employment of the name Arab for an inhabitant of any portion of the vast peninsula known to us as Arabia, begins somewhere in the 3rd century B.C., though the only trace of it in Old Testament is in the 2 ch., 21, where the Arabians that are near the Ethiopeans' would seem naturally to refer to the neighbours of the Habasha, whence there are grounds for placing in the extreme south of Yamen.&quot; The word arabia is expressly given to this country in the Old Testament (I Kings x. 15) when describing the visit of the Queen Sheba to Sololmon, which took place 1005 B.C. We also find the word arabah in Deut. i. 7 and ii. 8. Some writers hold that the village called Arabah, situated near Tehama, may be the name for the whole peninsula, an opinion scarcely deserving the least notice. 

In the Bible, the name Arab is the first word used in the second book of Chronicles (xvii, 11) to refer to nomads from the east bank of the Jordan river in the time of king Jehosophat (900-800 B.C.), such as &quot;...and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he- goats.&quot; 

The word arab or arabah is probably derived from a Semitic root related to nomadism. In the Arabic language, the word arab (derived from i'rab), means &quot;those who speak clearly&quot; as contrast with ajam (those who speak indistincly). In Holy Koran, the word arab has never used for the country of Arabia, but characterised the residence of Ismail, the son of Abraham as an &quot;uncultivated land.&quot; In the time of Ismail his place of residence had no name, therefore, it was given the name of an &quot;uncultivated land.&quot; In the Old Testament, the word midbar is used for Ismail's home, meaning a desert or a barren land, which closely corresponds to the Koranic description. 

The peninsula was divided by the ancient geographers into Arabia Petraea, Arabia Felix and Arabia Deserta. The Arabia Petraea corresponded to the present Hijaz and eastern Najd. Arabia Felix to Yamen and Hazarmawt and Arabia Deserta comprised the rest of the country. Arab Peninsula (jazirat al-Arab) is situated in south-west Asia, embosomed with sea waters on its three sides, i.e., the Red Sea in the west, the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the east, and the Arabian Sea in the south; is considered to be a largest peninsula in the world with an area of about 1,230,000 sq. miles, i.e., about one third of Europe, or almost six times bigger than France, ten times that of Italy and eight times bigger than Switzerland. Geographically it is an extention of the Sahara desert. It is divided into various parts of which Hijaz, Najd, Yamen, Hazarmawt and Oman are most important. The whole land is almost barren. The climate is extremely hot in summer and the coastal tracts are among the most torrid regions. 

Where are the Phoenicians today?
“The invaders of Phoenicia NEVER REPLACED the original population even when they added to their genetic diversity.”
“Are we arab? Are we Phoenician?”
“The majority come from the original Phoenicians who speak a language (or dialect) which is a mixture of Syriac, Aramaic, Turkish, and colloquial Arabic, as well as a some other languages.” 
As indicated earlier, the inhabitants of the countries that fell under Arab domination were forced to convert to Islam. However, a considerable number refused the new faith and remained steadfast in their Christian faith. Therefore, many Phoenician Christians became Muslims and their identity, as a separate people, was lost. At the same time, other Phoenician Christians kept their Byzantine, Maronite, Syriac, Assyrian or Chaldean (Coptic in Egypt) faith and are now able to identify their culture. These Phoenicians whether Christian or Muslim (who do not have a possible identifier of their Phoenician origin such as those of the Christian sects) -- see &quot; Am I Phoenician?&quot; in this site -- are spread all over the world. Despite the illusion that the Phoenicians of today live in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel/Palestine, or come from these countries; they can be found almost any where around the globe; and come from Phoenicia proper or its far away colonies. Many people from Spain, Tunisia, Sicily, Sardinia and other Mediterranean shores are of Phoenician descent (or descendants of immigrants from these places). They still proudly claim their Phoenician origin.

There are very few places in the world where one does not find a Phoenician buying or selling something under the pseudonym of Lebanese descendent. Phoenician trade is very much alive and well whether in Seattle, Washington, USA; Sydney, Australia; Cape Town, South Africa; São Pãulo, Brazil; or Paris, France.

 Who is Phoenician and who is Arab today?
A question which many people struggle with today. 

In response to this question which I get asked very often, I am publishing below one of my standard explanation or responses to this question. I am publishing exerpts of the letter as is, in a letter form, until I produce a detailed essay on the subject:

You question is very valid especially at a time when the Lebanese of the old 
country are defeated with too many powers that pull and push on them in many 
ways: politically, emotionally, economically and spiritually. 

It is not really possible for me to give you a complete, full and logical 
answer to your question in a short e-mail. I will, however, give you a 
summery of my studies and direct you to my website where a brief and 
incomplete attempt to answer the question is further developed. 

Simply put, the Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians come from mostly 
Phoenician blood which is a mix of the original Canaanites and the blood of 
invading armies that occupied that part of the world. Though the original 
stock of the population got mixed with invaders along the ages, they (the 
invaders) never **REPLACED** the population. This means that up till around 
the year 630+ A.D. Phoenicia as a political entity was still there and so 
were its people. Invading Arabs did NOT replace the population but 
subjugated many of them into Islam while the rest remained Christian. 
Simply put the population of the eastern Mediterranean is mostly made of the 
original Canaanite Phoenician people. The present population both Christian 
and Muslim continues to be Phoenician stock and those people were NOT put to 
death or exterminated and replaced by Arabs. To learn more about this 
particular subject, please visit my web page entitled &quot;Living Phoenicians&quot; 
http://phoenicia.org/today.html (actually this very page). 

Having said this, I am not saying that all the Muslims in Lebanon, Syria and 
Palestine are pure Phoenicians but that in their majority they come from 
Phoenician blood. The problem with the Muslim community is the fact that 
they have no repository of heritage that survives to this day because Islam 
separated them from that heritage. The repository of heritage is to be 
found in Christian sects and their rites, chants, iconography, building and 
language: Syriac and Aramaic languages of the Syraic Orthodox and Syriac 
Catholic churches, Maronites. The Byzantine Orthodox and Catholic were 
westernized or Byzantinized Phoenicians who employed Greek -- much like the 
Lebanese speak French today. All this is explained in the page mentioned 
above. 

Finally, I must include that few, very few Arabs and Christians were mixed 
into the Phoenician community. Specifically, the Ghassanides (Ghassasina in 
Arabic) were Yemeni Christians who immigrated to the area of north Jordan 
and south Syria. They were Sabaeans which many historians do not consider 
Arab based on archaeological evidence while the Koran mentions them as 
Arabs. Anyway, these Ghassanides were thought to be Arab because they came 
from Yemen after the Dam of Maarib broke and their economic life was messed 
up in Yemen. These people were of dark complexion, frizzy hair and thin 
lips. The Christian Gibarah family of Marj3yoon has roots from these 
people. It is important to note that the Gibarah family dialect or language 
is considerably other Aramaic and Syriac rich language of other Lebanese. 
Some other families may have had Ghassanide blood but knowing how far the 
persecution of Christians and their forced conversion to Islam over the 
centuries decimated the Christian communities of the east, it is very 
unlikely that many Ghassanides survived the ravages of history. Many of 
them were Jacobites who were persecuted into extermination. 

Converts to Christianity were very very few in the whole Middle East with 
the exception of some of the Princes of Lebanon such the Chehab, 
Abillamah...etc. Most Christians converted to Islam than otherwise. This 
means to say that the higher percentage of Arab blood among the Phoenician 
Muslim population may have come to the Christian community but in very 
minute measures. 

So, to answer your question &quot;Are we arab? Are we Phoenician,&quot; I would 
confirm to you in the majority we are Phoenicians who speak a mixture of 
Syriac, Aramaic, and colloquial Arabic. This applies to most of the 
Lebanese and the Syrians, especially all the way up on the Mediterranean 
shore. Many Palestinians are of Phoenician origin too. 

If you come from Christian or Muslim origin from that part of the world, you 
are Phoenician by heritage. If I were you, I would be proud of that and 900 
pages in my website is out there for you to learn from. 

How many Phoenician words do you know?
A study is underway to analyze spoken Lebanese and other similar languages/dialects of the Near East with Aramaic and Syriac to determine how these latter ancient languages continue to be used in the very-day language of people. Further, the study will include similarities with Maltese, the language of Malta, and identify similarity with Lebanese.

Phoenician Alphabet, Mother of Modern Writing 

Alphabetic writing was already well established in the Late Bronze Age at Ugarit where a cuneiform script was used. The Phoenician alphabetic script was borrowed to write well before the first millennium BC.

The Phoenicians were not mere passive peddlers in art or commerce. Their achievement in history was a positive contribution, even if it was only that of an intermediary. For example, the extent of the debt of Greece alone to Phoenicia may be fully measured by its adoption, probably in the 8th century BC, of the Phoenician alphabet with very little variation (along with Semitic loan words); by &quot;orientalizing&quot; decorative motifs on pottery and by architectural paradigms; and by the universal use in Greece of the Phoenician standards of weights and measures. Having mentioned this, the influence on or from Linear A and B scripts is unknown.

Phoenician words are found in Greek and Latin classical literature as well as in Egyptian, Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew writings. The language is written with a 22-character alphabet that does not indicate vowels.

Although the Phoenicians used cuneiform (Mesopotamian writing) in what we call Ugaritic, they also produced a script of their own. The Phoenician alphabetic script of 22 letters was used at Byblos as early as the 15th century B.C. This method of writing, later adopted by the Greeks, is the ancestor of the modern Roman alphabet. It was the Phoenicians' most remarkable and distinctive contribution to civilization.

The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder was a great admirer of the Phoenicians, he credited them with many discoveries, including the invention of trade. Although Pliny was not adverse to exaggerating, scholars do accept his evidence that Phoenicians were the first traveling salesmen. Because they needed an efficient method of keeping records, they invented an alphabet from which every alphabet of the world has descended. Along with an alphabet came the equipment for using it: pen, ink and, of course, papyrus, parchment and finally paper. A wax-writing tablet was found in an ancient Uluburun shipwreck (most likely to have been Canaanite Phoenician) off the coast of Turkey. Please see an image of the original wax tablet below.

The oldest of the attested Semitic languages, Akkadian, was the vehicle of a great ancient literature written in a logosyllabic cuneiform writing system of Sumerian origin. Records of other ancient Semitic languages exist in various forms. Amorite, another ancient Semitic language, is known from proper names; Ugaritic (please see image of Ugaritic cuneiform, top left) was written in a quasi-alphabetic cuneiform script unconnected with the Akkadian. The Canaanites of Phoenicia used a still undeciphered syllabic script, the Proto-Byblian, in the 2nd millennium BC, while those of Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula employed another undeciphered writing, the Sinaitic script, which may be alphabetic in nature. All the other Semites used and, for the most part, still use consonantal quasi-alphabets with no means or only imperfect means to distinguish the vowels. All such alphabets -- of which the more important are the Hebrew, the Aramaic/Syriac, and the Arabic -- are descended from the Phoenician linear quasi-alphabet of 22 signs, first attested at Byblos and externally similar to the Proto-Byblian script. All the European alphabets are descendants of the Phoenician, and all the Asiatic alphabets are descendants of the Aramaic variants of the Phoenician.

From a South Arabian variant of the earliest Semitic alphabet the Ethiopians developed a syllabic writing still in use for the languages of Ethiopia. Maltese uses the Latin alphabet.

The Phoenician alphabet in all its variants changed from its North Semitic ancestor only in external form -- the shapes of the letters varied a little in mainland Phoenician and a good deal in Punic (in North African Phoenician colonies) and neo-Punic. The alphabet remained, however, essentially a Semitic alphabet of 22 letters, written from right to left, with only consonants represented and phonetic values unchanged from the North Semitic script.

Phoenician Alphabet, Adopted by the Greeks 
According to the ancient Greek historian, Herodotus, the Phoenicians introduced their alphabet to Greece. Cadmus the Phoenician is attributed with the credit for this introduction. Further, Phoenician trade was the vessel which speeded the spread of this alphabet along side Phoenician trade which went to the far corners of the Mediterranean. Phoenician alphabet is the ancestor of the Greek alphabet and, hence, of all Western alphabets. 

The earliest Phoenician inscription that has survived is the Ahiram epitaph at Byblos in Phoenicia, dating from the 11th century BC and written in the North Semitic alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet gradually developed from this North Semitic prototype and was in use until about the 1st century BC in Phoenicia proper. 

Phoenician colonial scripts, variants of the mainland Phoenician alphabet, are classified as Cypro-Phoenician (10th-2nd century BC) and Sardinian (c. 9th century BC) varieties. A third variety of the colonial Phoenician script evolved into the Punic and neo-Punic alphabets of Carthage, which continued to be written until about the 3rd century AD. Punic was a monumental script and neo-Punic a cursive form. Following is the account from Herodotus on the origins of the Greek Alphabet in words of Herodotus.

Herodotus on the origins of the Greek Alphabet 
(5.58-61) from Herodotus, The Histories, transl. Audrey de Selincourt, 
Penguin Books, 1972. ISBN 0-14-044034-8

Repulsed from Sparta, Aristagoras went on to Athens, which had been liberated from autocratic government in the way which I will now describe. Hipparchus, the son of Pisistratus and brother of the despot Hippias, in spite of a vivid dream which warned him of his danger, was murdered by Harmodius and Aristogiton, two men belonging to the family of the Gephyraei; the murder, however, did the Athenians no good, for the oppression they suffered during the four succeeding years was worse than before. Hipparchus had dreamt, on the night before the Panathenaic festival, that the tall and beautiful figure of a man stood over his bed and spoke to him these obscure and riddling words:


O lion, endure the unendurable with enduring heart; 
No man does wrong and shall not pay the penalty.
At dawn next morning he was seen communicating his dream to the interpreters; but later he put it out of his mind and took part in the procession, during which he was killed.

The Gephyraei, to whom the two men who killed Hipparchus belonged, came, by their own account, originally from Eretria; but I have myself looked into the matter and find that they were really Phoenicians, descendants of those who came with Cadmus to what is now Boeotia where they were allotted the district of Tanagra to make their homes in. After the expulsion of the Cadmeans by the Argiva, the Gephyraei were expelled by the Boeotians and took refuge in Athens, where they were received into the community on certain stated terms, which excluded them from a few privileges not worth mentioning here. The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus - amongst whom were the Gephyraei - introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks. At first they used the same characters as all the other Phoenicians, but as time went on, and they changed their language, they also changed the shape of their letters. At that period most of the Greeks in the neighbourhood were Ionians; they were taught these letters by the Phoenicians and adopted them, with a few alterations, for their own use, continuing to refer to them as the Phoenician characters - as was only right, as the Phoenicians had introduced them. The Ionians also call paper 'skins' - a survival from antiquity when paper was hard to get, and they did actually use goat and sheep skins to write on. Indeed, even today many foreign peoples use this material. In the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Theba in Boeotia I have myself seen cauldrons with inscriptions cut on them in Cadmean characters - most of them not very different from the Ionian. There were three of these cauldrons; one was inscribed: 'Amphityron dedicated me from the spoils of the Teleboae' and would date from about the time of Laius, son of Labdacus, grandson of Polydorus and great-grandson of Cadmus. Another had an inscription of two hexameter verses:

Scaeus the boxer, victorious in the contest, 
Gave me to Apollo, the archer God, a lovely offering
This might be Scaeus the son of Hippocoon; and the bowl, if it was dedicated by him and not by someone else of the same name, would be contemporary with Laius' son Oedipus. The third was also inscribed in hexameters:

Laodamas, while he reigned, dedicated this couldron 
To the good archer Apollo - a lovely offering.
It was during the reign of this Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, that the Cadmeans were expelled by the Argives and took refuge with the Encheles. The Gephyraei remained in the country, but were later forced by the Boeoeians to withdraw to Athens, where they have certain temples set apart for their own special use, which the other Athenians are forbidden to enter; one of them is the temple of Demeter Achaeia, in which secret rites are performed.

Preface
The largest web compilation &amp; repository of studies about the origin, history, geography, religion, arts, crafts, trade, industry, climate, mythology, language, literature, music, politics, wars, archaeology and culture of the Canaanite Phoenicians.
Note: Phoenicians, Canaanites and Punic/Carthaginians are the same people: Eastern Canaanites called Phoenicians by the Greeks and Western Canaanites called Punic by the Romans.

Missionaries of Civilization
The Phoenicians were instrumental in disseminating their form of writing which became our modern alphabet and in opening up various civilizations and cultures of the Mediterranean basin to each other. Both sciences and pseudosciences spread from Egypt and Mesopotamia to Phoenicia and Anatolia. The Phoenicians, in particular, transmitted much of this knowledge to the various lands of the Mediterranean, especially to the Greeks. The direction taken by these influences can be followed from Egypt to Phoenicia, Syria and Cyprus. The evidence comes thanks to a combination of excavated art forms that prove the direction of movement, as well as to Greek tradition. The latter lays great stress on what the early Greek philosophers learned from Egypt. Mesopotamian influence can be traced especially through the partial borrowing of Babylonian science and divination by the Hittites and later by the transmission of information through Phoenicia. The Egyptians and Mesopotamians wrote no theoretical treatises; information had to be transmitted piecemeal through personal contacts.

Phoenician, what's in a name?
It is not certain what the Phoenicians called themselves in their own language; it appears to have been Kena'ani (Akkadian: Kinahna), &quot;Canaanites.&quot; In Hebrew the word kena'ani has the secondary meaning of &quot;merchant,&quot; a term that well characterizes the Phoenicians. 

The name 'Phoenicians,' was not what the Phoenicians called themselves but what the Greeks called them; the word means dark red in Greek and refers to the royal Tyrian purple dye that Phoenicians extracted from murex shells to dye cloth with and sold to the rich of the ancient world. The name appears in Psalm 45:14, in the phrase bat melek Ponnima (daughter of the king of the Phoenicians), which parallels bat Sor (daughter of Tyre) of verse 13. The same term, Ponnim (meaning the Phoenician language), appears in a comedy called Poenulus, by the Roman playwright T. Maccius Plautus (died 184 B.C.). The Latin poenus (noun) and punicus (adjective), as well as Greek phoinikos, refer to the term Phoenician.

Ethnic Origin and Language
The Phoenicians probably arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean about 3000 B.C., however, nothing is known of their original homeland. What may be the most common ethnic origin they are considered to be is Semitic; however, some studies suggest that their original homeland may have been in the Indian sub-continent long before 3000 B.C. while other studies trace their origin, according to Irish records, to suggest that they descend from a Scythian King named Phoeniusa Farsa...according to the Irish this kings' descendents eventually populated the country of Phoenicia and named the country in his honor...Phoeniusa son.

They spoke Phoenician which is very close to Aramaic. Phoenicians had a language and culture like those of other Semitic peoples in the general area and may be said to have been identical with the Canaanites of North Palestine.

Political Structure and Colonies
Their city states had a loose alliance and they established colonies in the far corners of the Mediterranean.

Religion and Mythology
They worshiped fertility gods and goddesses and their belief system was influenced by other religions in the Eastern Mediterranean and had some influence on Greek and Roman mythologies. At the beginning of the Christian era, Phoenicians were the first to accept the new faith after the Jews.

Troubled History
Phoenician cities, at the cross-roads of the East, were often invaded and subjugated by foreign conquerors which include Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Macedonians, Persians, and Romans, in addition to others. However, the Phoenicians were basically traders not warriors; and trade and war do not work well together.

Creators of Alphabet
They created a form of alphabet which evolved and was adapted by the Greeks to become the backbone of modern alphabet.

Commerce and Other Achievements
The Phoenicians were sea-faring traders who carried merchandise and goods across the Mediterranean. They circumnavigator Africa and used the Polar Star as a navigational guide.

Phoenician Art, Crafts, Music, and Literature
They dyed cloth which was the prized possession of the rich and worked in precious metals and ivory. Most Phoenician literature is unknown or was lost. However, second hand information and some ecclesiastical Phoenician works survive. Traces of their music may still be found in some church music today.

The Logo or Coat of Arms ©
The logo or Coat of Arms is my own creation and it represents Phoenician achievements and mythology. The two creatures or mythological monsters -- part horse, part fish -- called hippocampus come from Phoenician antiquity and represent Phoenician mythology. (The Trade link, under the subtitle Transit Trade, contains an image of a Phoenician silver coin with an impression of the hippocampus monster and a Phoenician ship.) Further, on the top of the logo, a piece of marble with Phoenician script represents Phoenician alphabet. Beneath it, the cloth represents famous Phoenician dyed cloth. At the very bottom, amphorae represent vessels which were used to carry Phoenician merchandise, as they traded about the Mediterranean.

Approach to This History
While researching material for this Web site, I have tried to be open to all new and sometimes controversial subjects. This is why some sections may contradict others in the same site, as well as contain quasi archaeology. Also, I have tried to be non-dogmatic in my approach, except when faced with blatantly outrageous claims. I am always willing and ready to shift paradigm. Further, I must insist, stress and categorically affirm that I have NO political, religious or ethnic agenda in promoting and disseminating information about my Phoenician Canaanites ancestors. Suggestions of nationalism, fanaticism or political propaganda are emphatically rejected. 
Phoenicia Died Out Misinformation
A number of historians ignorantly claim that the name, Phoenicia ceased from use in 64 BC, when it became part of the Roman world. However, official records indicate that in 425 AD Phoenicia Prima was subdivided into two provinces, Phoenicia Maritima and Phoenicia Libanensis by the Romans. Further, excavations of at Tel Kadesh (158 BC) in Israel as well as the witness of Saint Augustine (400 AD), Church Councils of Tyre (449 &amp; 515 AD), the Fall of Phoenicia to the Arabs (640 AD) and the honorary living title &quot;Metropolitan of Phoenicia Maritima&quot; which Lebanese bishops continue to carry today (MP3 Byzantine psaltica chants: Bishop of Beirut &amp; Bishop of Tripoli -- see page with translation) are a few of many solid proofs that Phoenicia and its people live on despite the misinformation.

The Bible and/or Tanach and History
Though there is some history in the Bible, Torah, Tanach and Apocryphal writings, using any of these books of faith for historical research and discussions is unacceptable. Having said this, I must confess that I am a Christian and do respect the Bible as a didactic source of faith. The said ancient scriptures and their mythological stories are unreliable historical sources; however, some historical outlines from the same books may be used in very general terms. This position may sound like that of the minimalist or nihilists (mentioned below) but it does not go to their extremes. Hence, the historicity of Kings Hiram, David and Solomon, Queen Jezebel, Ahab...etc. are allowable exceptions, in my opinion. So-called proofs of historical or genealogical significance based on these books are respectfully rejected dogma.

The Semites
Bible fanatics continue to write to me about the Semites being the descendents of Shem using the Bible as supporting evidence. This claim is completely unfounded. The term Semites is applied to a group of people closely related in language but not necessarily of the same ethnic origin -- Arabs, Israelis, Phoenicians, Aramaeans, Syriac...etc. They inhabited parts of the Levant. Though the expression is derived from the Biblical &quot;table&quot; of nations and the people are supposed to be descendants of Noah's son Sem (Shem), the term does not have any historical origin. It came into use at the end of the 18th century* and thereafter became a standard technical term. Like many other common mistakes -- such as lumping all the peoples of the Middle East into one pan-Arab group -- the term Semite was adopted and used without denoting true ethnicity.
________________
* The term Semite was proposed at first for the languages related to the Hebrew by Ludwig Schlözer, in Eichhorn's &quot;Repertorium&quot;, vol. VIII (Leipzig, 1781), p. 161. Through Eichhorn the name then came into general usage (cf. his &quot;Einleitung in das Alte Testament&quot; (Leipzig, 1787), I, p. 45. In his &quot;Gesch. der neuen Sprachenkunde&quot;, pt. I (Göttingen, 1807) it had already become a fixed technical term. The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XIII

For Stifling Phoenician History, I Accuse:
Eurocentrism, Judeocentrism, Arabists and Fundamentalist Christians
It became evident to me during my research that various forces impacted almost all Phoenician/Canaanite subjects. In short, I found that historians and archaeologists were predominantly inclined to Eurocentrism or Judeocentrism. Specifically, Phoenician thinkers were ignored and their work credited to the Greeks, Romans or Israelites.

N.B. The red-highlighted &quot;formulae&quot; are to be applied to all the paragraphs that follow though they don't negate racial intermarriages. Comments or correspondence regarding these points are regretfully not open for discussion. Abuse of open dialogue has made this measure necessary.

Phoenicians are not = to Arab, Israelis, sub-Saharan (black) Africans;
Canaanites are = Phoenician Canaanites, Punic (north African Phoenicians)

On the other hand, Minimalists/Nihilists (as referred to by Biblical Archaeologists) dismiss the 5 books of Moses and with them the exile in Egypt of Israelites, Exodus...etc as nothing but fiction written later than 1000 BC. With that they dismiss the existence of Kings David and Solomon. Their position is considered anti-Semitic by some; and they claim that the Israelites were actually Canaanites themselves. By doing that they confuse Phoenician Canaanite history with Israeli history (see the page entitled &quot;Stealing&quot;). The same is further aggravated by some fundamentalist Christian's British Israelism and the confusion over equating Dan, the lost tribe of Israel, with the Phoenicians. 

Roman Bad Press, Bible Writers, and Fanatics
Also, anti-Phoenician sentiments were the result of bad press by Roman historians, particularly after the Punic wars, and Jewish zealotism and hate of Phoenician religion by Bible writers. This was particularly so because of the infestation of pagan worship in the religion of the Israel caused by Queen Jezebel of Israel (a Phoenician Princess). Fundamentalist obsession with the literal interpretation of their religious book or political fanaticism of others with various agenda cloud the truth.

Arabists and Arab nationalists' antagonism of Phoeniciology and their &quot;Phoenician Complex&quot;
Many of various religious backgrounds from Arab countries, especially Lebanon and Levant Arabists simply cannot tolerate the mention of the Phoenicians or their descendent in the modern world. They assume such a mention has political and religious overtones. However, Phoenician blood runs through their own veins themselves and most people in the region -- Phoenician does not mean Maronite Christian only, something which nobody claims but which Arabists assume. Further, there is no reason for those aforementioned who suffer from this Phoenician Complex to deny their heritage. Such people have no shame and are fools to ignore their great heritage. Many people of the Western Mediterranean including European and North African Muslim, Arab countries proudly accept Phoenician as their heritage and ancestry. (see the page on Tunisia). Canaanite Phoenicians pre-date the Arabs, anyway.

Afrocentrism
Afrocentrism is not without blame in smothering Phoenician contribution to the ancient world. Many historians and archaeologists of that persuasion claim that the Phoenicians Canaanites themselves where sub-Saharan African based on unscientific Biblical myths or some unfounded claims that associates Canaanites with Egyptians. They, therefore, deny the Canaanites their proper place in history . Phoenicians of the Eastern Mediterranean or the Western Mediterranean (such as famous Hannibal or the Phoenicians of Carthage, Spain, Portugal, Sicily...etc.), the Punic, were Semites*

* This statement does not negate the theory that all humans first evolved in Africa and thereafter populated the world.

Note: The excerpts and conclusions which are herewith provided are mere speculations. They are kindly presented by a scholar who wishes to remain anonymous. The author/compiler of this Web site presents them for your consideration. They do not necessarily represent his opinion even when he is open to higher criticism.

There are contradictory leads regarding the 'Celtic connection' to the Phoenicians, and they need to be considered as mere leads even when they may seem confusing to individuals who are already familiar with contradictory leads. There seems to be an ongoing debate, among the experts, regarding the origins and definition of the 'Celts'. Therefore, it is imperative to examine what is herewith presented in this light. 
 
Are the Phoenicians and Celts related?
The Phoenicians and the Celts may have originated in the Indus Valley, and also the Knossus Civilization of Crete, circa 2600 BC, plus perhaps the Sumerians, who came by sea to Sumer around 3800 BC. Or... perhaps the Phoenician, but NOT the original &quot;Celts&quot; were from the Indus Valley, and today's Celts are actually a mixture of the Phoenicians plus a &quot;pre-Celtic&quot; group. This and many other related questions remain open.

The following information asserts the above idea and excerpts are presented for debate.

&quot;Today a complete unanimity of opinion among physical anthropologists that the term Celt, if used at all, belongs to the brachycephalic (round headed) darkish population of the Alpine (Swiss) highlands..... totally lacking in the British Isles.&quot; -- W.Z. Ripley, Races of Europe. 124, 126, 305.

&quot;....scientific anthropologists and classic historians have proved that the &quot;Celts&quot; of history were the non-Aryan, round-headed, darkish small statured race of south Germany and Switzerland, and that the &quot;Celts&quot; properly so called are &quot;totally lacking in the British Isles.&quot; Thus, to speak as is so commonly done, of &quot;Celtic ancestry,&quot; the &quot;Celtic &quot;temperament,&quot; and &quot;Celtic fire&quot; amongst any section of the natives of these islands, is, according to anthropologists merely imagination. &quot;The term &quot;Celt&quot; or &quot;Celt&quot; is entirely unknown as the designation of any race or racial element of language in the British Isles, until arbitrarily introduced there a few generations ago. Nor does the name even exist in the so-called &quot;Celtic&quot; languages, the Gaelic, Welsh and Irish. It is, on the contrary, the classic Greek and Latin title of a totally different race of a totally different physical type from that of the British Isles, and that the word was only produced there by unscientific phlogistic and ethnologists some decades ago....&quot; -- L.A. Waddell, &quot;Phoenician origin of Britons, Scots and Anglo-Saxons&quot;, p 127f.

&quot;It will thus be noticed that this &quot;Celtic&quot; area corresponds generally in Scotland with the area in which the &quot;Picts&quot; suddenly disappeared, and in whose place have suddenly appeared the people called &quot;Celts&quot;. In Ireland also the &quot;Celtic&quot; area generally corresponds with that part of the country specially associated with the Bans, Van or Early Feins, who, we have found, were Picts. &quot;This new line of evidence leads us to the conclusion that the early &quot;Celts&quot; or &quot;Kelts&quot; were presumably the early Picts calling themselves &quot;Khaldis&quot; or &quot;Khaltis&quot;. They were a primitive people, who, I find from a mass of evidence, were early &quot;Chaldees&quot; or Galat (1) and &quot;Gal (2)&quot; of Van and Eastern Asia Minor and Mesopotamia in the Stone Age.&quot; -- L.A. Waddell, &quot;Phoenician origin of Britons, Scots and Anglo- Saxons&quot;, p. 139.

History tells us that England was settled by the Phoenicians who sailed to England to mine the tin. The Phoenicians invaded England in 1103 BC and when they arrived they found England to be inhabited by the Picts. Picts were a small people and were considered aborigines. Over a period of time the Phoenicians were assimilated. Today the small descendants of this intermarriage between the Picts and the Phoenicians have been incorrectly termed Celts.

&quot;.......the daring Phoenician pioneers were not Semites as hitherto supposed, but were Aryans in Race, Speech and Script. They were, besides, disclosed to be the lineal blood ancestors of the Britons and Scots -- properly so-called, that is, as opposed to the aboriginal, dark Non-Aryan people of Albion, Caledonia, Hibernia, the dusky small-statured Picts and kindred &quot;Iberian&quot; tribes. -- p. vi of &quot;The Phoenician Origin of Britons, Scots and Anglo-Saxons&quot; (1924)

It is incorrect to say &quot;British royalty&quot;. The royal line is English. (The latter statement is severely disputed in a letter to the editor, please follow this link to the related page where the counter argument is profusely presented). The English are Anglo-Saxons from Germany. They came to England about the 5th Century. The British are descendants of the Britons from Phoenicia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Rig Veda: A History Showing how the Phoenicians had their earliest home in India.
A Bengali Essay on the Subject by Rajeswar Gupta 

 Preface 

Many truths lie buried in the dark depth of the past covered over by numerous strata of forgotten events. I propose to dig up one of them, one that would have to combat the history of the primitive ages as it is commonly accepted and also the cherished theories of the scholars of the east and the west, both old and new. What I fear is that the importance of the discovery may fail to attract the attention of the learned world through my own insignificance, utterly unknown to fame as I am. But I consider the task I have set upon myself to be of great moment, and nothing undaunted I intend to strike out the path, for diligence in the cause of truth is destined to bring its reward and recognition of the truth
I begin by recapitulating first the results of my investigation to create, if possible, an interest in the subject at the outset. They are the following:

A great war broke out in the remote old days between the Indian Aryans and the Phoenicians in which the latter were defeated and compelled to leave wholly or partially the land of the Aryans. 
Most of the Suktas of the Rig Veda either describe or refer to this and many other wars. 
The Rig Veda, therefore, is not a poem only but a history. The current meanings of most of the Suktas will accordingly have to be altered and the Rig Veda SANHITA itself explained in a way different from the accepted one. 
The Phoenicians were the first of the civilized nations of the world. The civilization of Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, Greece and other ancient countries owed its origin to the union of the civilization of the Aryans with that of the Phoenicians. 
The Phoenicians originally lived in Afghanistan or in some part of India, whence driven out they migrated gradually westwards. While still residing in the neighbourhood of India they colonized and traded with Arabia and the countries bordering on the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. 
The Phoenicians had colonies in many countries from each of which they were driven away by the natives after severe struggles. In this way they were expelled from India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, or they mixed with the natives when they lost their supremacy in those countries. 
The primitive civilization of the world was born long before the time known to us. 
In ancient time the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea were connected together by a strait through which the Phoenician and Aryan trading ships entered the Mediterranean Sea and Indian goods were taken to Europe. As that passage gradually silted up the connection between India and Europe broke off. 
These conclusions will lead on to many others which it is neither the place nor the time to dilate upon. They are sure to revolutionize the history of the world, chalk out a new path for linguistic researches, and recast the classification of the human races when the agitation caused by their novelty has calmed down and they have found acceptance with the learned world. A careful investigation, I am confident, will reveal the truth of these statements to honest enquirers, and the feeble track I lay out will before long turn to a high road in skilled hands of willing labourers in the cause.

 The Panis

The word Pani occurs in not less than 36 riks of the Rig Veda It is used in one form or another in all the Mandalas except the fifth and the ninth, the forms being Panih, Panim, Paneen and Panayah. In the Sukta no. 108 alone of the tenth mandala the word is employed eight times. There are 11 riks in the 108th Sukta of the tenth mandala, and ill six of them Pani is the god. In some of the books the god is mentioned as Panayah and in other as Panayásura

It should be noted here that the names of the gods and the Rishis with which each Sukta begins were selected long after the collection of the VEDAS. These were determined in the Index known as the Anukramanee. The Anukramanee which has been followed in the Rik-Sanhita in adopting the names of the gods and the rishis, was composed by Katyayana Katyayana came after Yáska and it is therefore evident that the names were invented many centuries afterwards without having any historic truth in them. There is nothing in the Suktas themselves which can throw any light in elucidating these words. Moreover in some of the riks two or three names are mentioned of which only one is to be taken as the god. It is clear the commentator himself was at a loss to decide the point. It would not have been the case had the composer of the Sukta made the selection himself. Had he done so he would surely have mentioned only, one god instead of many. Take for example the 58th Sukta of the fourth mandala. The gods named therein are: -- Agni (Fire), Surya (the Sun), Ap (Water), Gabo (the Cows), or Ghrita (clarified butter). The same remarks apply to the use of the names of the rishis, vide the 2nd Sukta of the fifth mandala in which the names of the rishis are: -- KUMÁRA the son of ATRI, or KRISA, the son of JAR, or both. The inference therefore is that the names of the rishis, the gods arid the chandas heralding each Sukta, were inserted many years after the composition of the Sanhita itself, and must accordingly, be taken at their proper worth. Pani and Asura are two different words with different meanings. The Panis were not Asuras. The application of the word Panyásura as the name of the god in the 168th rik, quoted above, is to be taken to date from the Pauranic period and not the Vedic.

 The Stealing of Cows

The stealing of cows by the Panis forms one of the most important factors of the Rik-Sanhita. The Suktas in which the Panis are mentioned, in which allusion is made to cows, or in which Indra is the god, are mostly related, directly or indirectly, to the stealing of cows. The commentator Sáyanáchárya admits this to be the case almost everywhere. Mr. Romesh Chunder Dutt, following the footsteps of Professor Max Muller, finds those of the Suktas or riks to contain the story of the stealing of cows in which the word Pani occurs, and considers the views of Sáyana as far fetched with regard to other Suktas and riks

In the commentary Sáyana makes reference to the Panis in explaining Sukta 33 of the first mandala (Vide page 79 of Mr. Dutt's edition), which runs . &quot;Desiring to get back the cows, stolen by the Asuras known as the Panis, &amp;c.&quot; Mr. Dutt rejects, this allusion to the Panis on the ground that they are not mentioned in the Sukta. The list I have prepared will. however, show that the word Pani does occur in rik 3 of the Sukta and it may be noticed that Mr. Dutt has made no attempt to prove Sáyana wrong in his explanation there In my opinion Sáyana's exposition appears to be the correct one when we study the Sukta as a whole. Sáyana refers again to the story of the stealing of cows when he begins his commentary on Mandala 11, Sukta 24, rik 6, and states how the homes of the Asuras of the Pani tribe were burned by the messengers of the Devas (gods) when they were discovered with the stolen cows by the hound Saramá. Sukta 108 of the tenth mandala will bear this out as nowhere else is the story related more fully and clearly. But Mr. Dutt, on the authority no doubt of European scholars, sets down this simple affair as merely an allegory without having any underlying historical basis.

Prof. Max Muller says . &quot;It is a reproduction of the old story of the break of day. The bright cows the rays of the Sun or the rain clouds, for both go by the same name, have been stolen by the Powers of darkness, by the Night and her manifold progeny. Gods and men are anxious for their return. But where are they to be found? They are hidden in a dark or strong stable, or scattered along the ends of the sky, and the robbers will not restore them. At last, in the furthest distance the first signs of the Dawn appear, she peers about and runs with lightning quickness, it may be, like a hound after a scent, across the darkness of the sky. She is looking for, and following the right path, she has found it. She has heard the lowing of the cows, and she returns to her starting place with more intense splendour. After her return Indra arises, the God of light ready to do battle in good earnest against the gloomy Powers, to break open the strong stable in which the bright cows were kept, and to bring light and strength and life back to his pious worshippers.&quot; Science of Language, Vol II PP. S 13-514.

The following points. however, require elucidation before we can accept the theory of the Western scholars:

The Dawn never returns after it has once disappeared, before the same Sun-rise. 
The allegory as described does not correspond with the story as related in the original. 
If by the God of light the Sun is meant, what becomes of Indra? 
 Saramá

To ascertain the meaning of a Vedic word it is necessary to have some acquaintance with the expounders of the Vedas. If I hold that at to know the Vedas correctly we need not follow the Western scholars, it must not be inferred that I disregard them. I am not however prepared to honour them before the scholars of my own country. To put without rhyme or reason a different construction on the exposition of the Vedic scholars of India, is to ignore them and as it were to persecute the M.

The writers of the Niruktas were the first expounders of the Rig Veda. The works of three of them, out of four whose names are available, are not forthcoming. Yáska, whose writings have been preserved, was the fourth writer of the series. According to Mr. R. C. Dutt Yáska flourished in the 9th century B.C., and if it be admitted that the Rig Veda was composed two thousand years before the birth of Christ, Yáska must have had to elucidate the Vedic words tracing their evolution through the history of the country for eleven hundred years. But it is impossible that he could have done so, and I do dot think I need adduce any reasons for my assertion. He had to explain the unintelligible riks with the help of tradition and the dictionaries extant. Achárya Sáyana also followed the same course for the purpose, only that his profound wisdom and valuable researches shed a brighter lustre on it. Prof. H. H. Wilson thus speaks of Sáyana: &quot;He undoubtedly had a knowledge of his text far beyond the pretension of any European scholar, and must have been in possession either through his own learning or that of his assistants, of all the interpretations which had been perpetuated by traditional teaching C. 1 earliest time.

The Western scholars take the Rig Veda to be a collection of hymns in praise of nature. This theory they have consistently followed without looking to history for the correct exposition of the Vedas. In fact they have gone the other way of deducing history from the Vedas. But I would follow the scholars of my own country who did not try to create a history out of the Vedas. I would make history my guide in opening up the secrets of those sacred books. I must however at the outset say that my acknowledgments are due to the scholars who have already taken the lead in unfolding the mysteries of the Vedas, as also to Mr. R, C. Dutt in particular.

The dispute is in regard to the correct meaning of the three words, Pani, saramá and go. For the meaning of the first Prof. Max Muller depends on the meaning of the second. According to Prof. Kuhan, Saramá means storm. He says that Saramá is only a different form of the Teutonic Storm and the Greek herme. The word Saramá is derived from the root Sar with the suffix amá and Sar means to go. Saramá therefore means a runner or one who goes quickly. But storm or wind does not appear to be the correct meaning of the word Saramá as used in the Vedas. There Saramá is a messenger of Indra; she seeks out the lost cows and goes about to distant places. For her services she is rewarded with food for her son, (I. 62. 3) and she gets a large quantity of milk from Indra and others (1. 72. 8). So Saramá cannot mean the storm or the wind.

Prof. Max Muller would think that saramá and the early dawn were one and the same thing. He says: &quot;There can be little doubt that she (Saramá) was meant for the early dawn, and not for the storm. In the ancient hymns of the Rig Veda she is never spoken of as a dog, nor can we find there the slightest allusion to her canine &quot;nature. This is evidently a later thought.&quot; Science of Language, Vol. II. R 5 51. I agree with the learned Professor in holding that

Saramá was not a dog. The Panis concealed the cows: Saramá discovered them and informed Indra. It would appear that in those days whoever found out a lost thing after a careful search -- an informer -- was called Saramá and naturally the word came to mean a dog long after the Vedic days. To reconcile the meaning of the word in the Vedas, Sáyana ascribes to her supernatural powers, or how could a dog speak? Nothing, was impossible in the land of the gods.

In the Rig Veda Saramá has been given a number of attributes. She is the messenger of Indra (X. 108 2); she is beautiful, fortunate (X. 108 5); she is fair-footed or swift-footed. Surely these cannot be attributed to a dog.

Prof. Max Muller says. &quot;It is Ushás the Dawn, who wakes first (I 123. 1); who comes first to the morning prayer (1. 123. 2). The-, sun follows behind as a man follows a woman (Rv I. 115. 2). Of whom is it said, as of Saramá, that she brings to light the precious things hidden in darkness? It is Ushás, the Dawn, who reveals the bright treasures that were covered by the gloom (1. 123. 6). She crosses the water unhurt (VI. 64. 4); she lays open the ends of heaven (1. 92 11); those very ends where, as the Panis said, the cows were to be found. She is said to break the strongholds and bring back the cows (VII. 75. 7; 79. 4). It is she who, like Saramá, distributes wealth among, the sons of men (1. 92. 3; 123. 3). She possesses the cows (1. 123. 12. &amp;C.) she is even called the mother of the cows (IV. 52. 2). The Angiras, we read, asked her for the cows (VI. 65. 5), and the doors of the dark stable are said to be opened by her (IV. 5 1 2). In one place her splendour is said to be spreading as if she were driving forth cattle (1. 92. 12); in another the splendours of the Dawn are themselves called a drove of cows (IV. 51. 8; 52. 5). Again, as it was said of Saramá that she follows the right path, the path which all heavenly powers are ordained to follow, so it is particularly said of the Dawn that she walks in the right way (1. 12 4. 3; 1 13. 12). Nay even the Penis, to whom Saramá was sent to claim the cows, arc mentioned together with Ushás, the Dawn. She is asked to wake those who worship the gods, but not to wake the Panis ( ( 1 124. 10). In another passage (IV 51. 3) it is said that the Panis ought to sleep in the midst of darkness while the Dawn rises to bring treasures for man.

It is more than probable, therefore, that Saramá was but one of the many names of the Dawn &quot;

From these the Professor concludes that Saramá and Ushá or the dawn are the same thing. But I am unable to subscribe to this view. If Saramá could not be the storm, it could neither be the dog. It is absurd that such epithets as fair-footed and beautiful should qualify a dog, or that such expressions as returning to Indra and crossing a stream should be predicated of a storm.

The learned Professor was so charmed with the Greek stories of the light, the darkness 1 a and the dawn, that he was led to trace the allegory in the Vedas even. And it was very natural. The son of a famous German poet he was taught from his infancy to look upon the world with the eyes of a poet as full of poetry. He loved poetry and saw it everywhere in nature all around. To him the Rig Veda therefore was nothing but a poem, a book of hymns, and hence the allegorical expositions. Thus what was meant to be a history was taken to be a poem. Let me however point out that the Rig Veda is not a poem but a history, the first and the most ancient history of the world. It is impossible for a nation to have a poem without having a history of its own. Prof. Max Muller would even trace the origin of the Trojan war in the epic of the immortal HOMER to the stories of the Panis and Sarainá in the Rig Veda. To discover the original meaning of old and obsolete words it is necessary to know (I) the condition or history of the then society, (2) the intellectual progress attained by the men of the time, and (3) the changes in the meaning which the words themselves have undergone from time to time. I would only point out here that at least the first two requisites were not fulfilled by the Western scholars in ascertaining the meaning of the Vedic words. In fact the allegorical explanations they have given to various words and passages of the Rig Veda would point to an intellectual state of our forefathers which it was not possible for them to have attained in those early days. Development of the Imagination must follow, and not precede the maturity of the Intellect.

The misconceptions of the Western scholars are more-over largely due to their acceptance of the current meanings ideas and of the Vedic words in explaining long-forgotten usages. It should be remembered that the modern meanings of words have reference to the modern state of the human society. An attempt to explain the Vedas, which are four or five thousand years old, in the light of present day signification of words is undoubtedly vain and useless. In two or three hundred years even many words and their meanings as well become obsolete and antiquated. What wonder, therefore, that a large number of words of an ancient work like the Vedas should be entirely forgotten after the lapse of so many centuries? The use of many words in their original Vedic sense has been forbidden even after the days of Sáyana. The dictionaries which are the repositories of words and their meanings were themselves compiled long after the Vedas when a great many of the words had lost their etymological signification; and the grammar has only puzzled the scholars in arriving at the correct import of the Vedic words, as it deals with but a few of the various meanings which particular words conveyed. Hence it is that the principal Vedic words have been made to mean what was not contemplated by the sages of old who used them first. The words Sarainá, Pani, Go, Indra, Soma, the twins Asvi, etc., are of this class and difficult to unravel.

 The Meaning of the Word Pani

I wish Prof. Max Muller had taken the same pains to ascertain the meaning of the word Pani as he had done for Saramá. To get at the correct meaning of the latter it is desirable that we should first know the correct meaning of the former. And so I begin with the word Pani.

I have already said that the word Pani is mentioned no less than 36 times in the Rig Veda. The word Pani forms as it were the backbone of the Rig Veda: it is the key that unfolds the meaning of the sacred book, Not only do the stories of Saramá and Pani, but also good many riks depend for their proper interpretation upon the correct meaning of the word Pani itself. The rules of grammar relating to numbers and inflections have not been observed in the Rig Veda and it is not unusual for a word in the singular number to denote plural ideas or objects.

The expression Revatá Paniná (4. 25. 7) shows that the Panis were rich. 
The expression Paner maneeshán (3. 58. 2) shows that the Panis were wise. 
Abasam Panim (6. 61. I) would show that the Panis were given to introspection. 
The rik 7-6-3 tells us that the Panis did not perform any Yajnas or sacrifices; were garrulous, arrogant or haughty; had no respect for Yajanas and were Dasyus i.e., idlers or robbers. According to Sáyama they were usurers also. 
In 1. 33. 3 the word Pani is used for traders. Mr. Dutt, evidently following the European scholars, adopts the meaning of the term as traders in this rik. It is therefore clear that the Panis were a trading people and sold things for their value. 
The rik 6. 5 1 14 represents the Panis as gluttons. For their voracious eating they were regarded as monsters. The word is also explained to mean illiterate traders. 
All these would go to show that the word Pani could never mean darkness. It must mean men or some creatures akin to men. They were indeed a nation of traders without sacrifices, selfish, illiterate and usurious.

A nation of traders of those ancient days recalls the Phoenicians of old, for they were the only trading people then. In those days the Phoenicians were known as the Panis. The Aryans spoke of them as the Panih and the Romans as the Punic.

The question now is, how did the Panis come to be the neighbours of the Aryans?

Prof. Keightly says that the Phoenicians called themselves Kedmus In the Semitic language Kedmum means the East. it is probable that the Phoenicians came from the East and so gloried in the name of Kedmus, i.e., an Eastern people. This again would show that civilization had travelled from the east and had not its origin in Egypt.

Herodotus, known in the West as the father of History, was born in Asia Minor in 434 B.C. He travelled over many countries and recorded the experiences of his travels. He says: &quot;The more learned of the Persians assert the Phoenicians to have been the original exciters of contention. This nation migrated from the borders of the Red Sea to the place of their present settlement, and soon distinguished themselves by their long and enterprising voyages. They exported to Argos, amongst other places, the produce of Egypt and Asia.&quot; Chapter I. Book 1.

Prof. Larchar of Ireland says: &quot;Some authors make the Phoenicians to have originated from the Persian Gulf.&quot; And in Pockock's 'India in Greece' we have (vide page 218), &quot;There to the north dwelt the singularly ingenious and enterprising people of Phoenicia Their first home was Afghanistan

I could multiply such quotations in support of my views. These lead me to conclude that from Afghanistan the Phoenicians went to the coast of the Persian Gulf, from the Persian Gulf to the borders of the Red Sea in Arabia and thence to Phoenicia, their last colony and home. I should like to observe here that they had, before their occupation of Phoenicia, colonized Egypt and the islands of the Mediterranean Sea. They had colonies in Greece and in the adjacent countries even. In fact with the Phoenicians or Panis the light of civilization travelled from the cast to the west.

The Phoenician held their own civilization to be the most ancient and declared it to be thirty thousand years old. There is however no doubt that they were one of the first civilized nations of the world, if not the first, and that Phoenicia was not their first home. Instead of tracing them to their first settlements on the coasts of Arabia or Persia or in Afghanistan the historians of Europe have located them at once in Phoenicia, and hence the mistake that points to the origin of all civilization in Egypt. I would not discuss here the question whether Afghanistan was the first home of the Phoenicians or not. But I would affirm that the Panis or Panih of the Rig Veda were the same people as the ancient Phoenicians of Afghanistan.

 The Meaning of the Word Go

After ascertaining the meaning of the word Pani I take up next the Vedic word Go Saramá will be the last word of my investigation.

The word go occurs in almost all the riks in which the word Pani is used, and also in those Sutras in which Indra is the god or Ushá is the goddess. Prof. Max Muller has generally explained go as the rays of the Sun. I have not yet been able to know how other Western scholars explain the word. Mr. Dutt has followed Prof. Max Muller and has presented his view as shared by, a number of Vedic scholars. Sáyana interprets the word as water in certain passages, and as the re rays of the Sun in others, vide 4. 5 1. 3 and 4. 52. 2. There are, again, places where he gives no synonym for the word at all

Sáyana flourished in the fourteenth century A.D., when the Sanscrit vocabulary had been almost perfected. The word go then had for its synonyms Heaven, ray, thunder, the moon, the sun, animal, the cow-sacrifice, cow, water, organ or sense, word, etc. And yet with all these before him Sáyana did not try to explain away the word go when he came across it in the incidents relating to the theft of the go by the Panis. A reference to the various passages will show that in such cases he has taken the word go to mean the cow or cows and not the rays of the sun.

Let us see how the Rig Veda can itself help us in ascertaining the meaning of the word go.

It is said in 4.58.4 that the Panis kept concealed in the go three kinds of butter and the gods came to know of it. It is absurd to suppose that go which produced milk, curd and butter were rays of the sun and not cows. There cannot be the least doubt that go meant cows.

'The conversation between the Panis and Saramá in the 108th Sukta of the tenth mandala, as translated into Bengali by Mr. Dutt, convincingly shows that the word go could not mean any thing but cows, that it meant some animal and not rays of the sun.

I quote below the passage as rendered in English by Professor Max Muller

The Panis said: 'With what intention (did Saramá reach this place! for the way is far, and leads tortuously away. What was your wish with us? How was the night? How did you cross the waters of the Rasá?' 
Saramá said: 'I come, sent as the messenger of Indra, desiring, O Panis, your great treasures; this preserved me from the fear of crossing and thus I crossed the waters of the Rasá.' 
The Panis: 'What kind of man is I Indra O Saramá? What is his look, he as whose messenger thou camest from afar? Let him come hither, and we will make friends with him, and then he may be the cowherd of our cows.' 
Saramá: 'I do not know that he is to be subdued, for it is he himself that subdues, he as whose messenger I came hither from afar. Deep streams do not overwhelm him; you, Panis, will lie prostrate, killed by Indra.' 
The Panis: 'These are the cows, O Saramá which thou desirest, flying about the ends of the sky, O darling. Who would give them up to thee without fighting? For our weapons too are sharp.' 
Saramá: 'Though your words, O Panis, be unconquerable, though your wretched bodies be arrowproof, though the way to you be hard to go. Brihaspati will not bless you for either.' 
The Panis: 'That store, O Saramá, is fastened to the rock furnished with cows, horses, and treasures. Panis watch it who are good watchers; thou art come in vain to this bright place.' 
Saramá: 'Let only the Rishis come here fired with Soma, Ayasya (Indra) and the ninefold Angiras; they will divide this stable of cows; then the Panis will vomit out this speech 
The Panis: 'Art thou, 0 Saramá, come hither driven by the violence of the Gods? Let us make thee our sister, do not go away again; we will give thee part of the cows, 0 darling.' 
Saramá: 'I know nothing of brotherhood or sisterhood; Indra knows it and the awful Angiras. They seemed to me anxious for their cows when I came therefore get away from here, 0 Panis, far away.' 
'Go far away, Panis, far away; let the cows come out straight the cows which Brihaspati found hid away, Soma, the stones, and the wise Rishis.' 
 The Meaning of the Word Saramá

If Pani means the Phoenician merchant and go the cow, it can easily be understood that Saramá cannot mean either the (she) Dog of the gods or the Dawn. Professors Max Muller, Monier Williams and others have taken the Vedic story of the theft of cows as an allegorical representation of the conflict between light and darkness or day and night Hence they have explained a good many riks as hymns in praise of Nature I am sure these scholars have not at every step followed the proper meaning of the Vedic words but have adopted what they themselves thought to be their plausible meaning.

Saramá introduces herself to the Panis as the messenger of Indra. I can safely affirm without stopping to enquire who Indra was, that Saramá is neither a dog, nor the Dawn, but she is human and she is a woman. It may be of interest to note that the Panis do not ask her who she is, but who Indra is, by whom she is sent to them. It is evident she is already known to them. The very conversation between them shows that they are not strangers. This leads me-to infer that by Saramá is meant those Pani-women who with their children had been imprisoned by the Angiras.

The Angiras and their party had compelled these Saramás or messengers to capitulate for them with the Panis. They could not leave their children without making due provisions for them (1-62-3) as they were afraid of being detained by the Panis. Or it may be that the Angiras forced the mothers to go out to the Panis as their messengers and kept the children as hostages for the successful performance of their duty.

It would seem that for some reason or other the study of the Rig Veda was for many centuries forbidden, and so the present confusion about the meaning of the Vedic words. The age of the Puranas evidently had its origin in an attempt to discover the original meaning of those words. In their ignorance of the proper signification of the epithets the commentators thought out gods and goddesses hoping to give a rational explanation of the sacred books. Thus they were led to ascribe to inanimate objects desires and functions which they could never exercise or possess, forgetting that the words in question in the Vedas related to men and their actions. And thus did the age of the Puranas or Mythology come into existence clothing the Vedas with absurdities. Still however in the hands of the Indian scholars like Sáyana and others the Vedas were not wholly divested of their historical garb. But the Western scholars, on the other hand, led by Professor Max Muller, have gone a step further -- they have declared the Vedas to be nothing more than hymns in praise of Nature. Hence the difference in the interpretations of the Rig Veda by the savants of the East and the West. Investing the Vedas with mythical ideas Sáyana has interpreted Saramá to be the Dog-messenger of the gods, while to Max Muller and his followers she is only the storm or the Dawn to suit their theory that the Vedas are but a collection of hymns. In the latter is lost the vestige of historic worth of the Vedas that is still traceable in the former. I am led to discard both these views . I accept the Vedas as a history recording the actions of men-that this -- view is correct will be amply demonstrated in this treatise .

Sukta 108, quoted above,' if properly interpreted, will show that Saramá could have been nothing but a woman. In fact the expressions used therein cannot be correctly and rationally explained except in relation to man. For this and various other reasons I have interpreted Saramá as an imprisoned (or prisoner) Pani (Phoenicians) woman.

Another point worthy of notice in this connection is that all primitive words originally meant objects or things. Abstract or metaphorical meanings, as they implied intellectual development, came in long afterwards. The Rig Veda was composed in the primitive age of words and it was almost impossible for them to have been used metaphorically at that stage. The metaphorical and allegorical interpretation of the Vedas by the Western scholars cannot therefore be considered sound and reasonable.

 The Cause of the War

I may now say with Sáyana that the Panis stole the cows of the Angirás or of their friends. The Angirás defeated the Panis with the help of Indra and other powerful allies and regained their cows. I must however admit here that I am not yet certain whether the Panis stole the cows of the Angiras or the Angiras attempted to take by force the cows belonging to the Panis, for the Angiras and their partisans would not unoften seize the cows of others: vide Suktas 6-45-24 and 6-45-32. This shows that the Angiras would ask for cows from Kavitsa and Bribu. Some of the owners would part with their cows without any objection to continue their friendship with the Angiras, but some would object and a fearful strife would ensue. The Angiras would ask the Panis to give them their cows, but they would not do so willingly. So the Angiras sometimes took their cows by force -- vide 1-93-4. Many of the Aryan families were afraid of the Angiras and they would not oppose them. But the Panis were 'rich and powerful and possessed many hill forts and fortified towns: 6-45-9. So they were not afraid to defy Angiras.

In riks 4-93-1 and 1-39-6 the cow is mentioned as in article of food. It is therefore evident that the Angiras were in the habit of taking beef and other meat. I have shown before elsewhere in my Bengali journal the Anjali, (Part 12, Vol. 1) that the Indian Aryans used to take animal food and intoxicating drinks, for which they fought amongst themselves I am not yet sure if the Panis were Aryans, but there is no doubt that they had a terrific quarrel with the flesh eating Angiras and their party for their cows and other cattle

It is now necessary to determine who the Angiras were. They were the principal branch of the Aryans. Rik 2-24-6 describes them as learned. Brahmanspati or Brihaspati was their leader or headman. In rik, 5-101-1 Sáyana interprets Brahmané in relation to the caste or the family. of the Brahmans or the Angiras. This would show that the Brahmans of the later days were no other than the Argiras of the Vedic period. The word Brahmavih occurs in rik 9-33-1 . Sáyana explains it as Mantraíh that is by incantations or the sacred words. According to Pandit Ramanath Sarasvati the word means by the worshippers. Mr. Dutt however following Professor Wilson (and perhaps accepting the reading Nibrahmavih) makes it mean by those who were tenable to accept the mantras, but says in the note that the meaning of the passage is not clear. I think the meaning would be clear enough if the word were taken to denote the Angiras. It should be remembered that according to Sáyana the Brahmans are the descendants of the Angiras.

The Angiras were flesh-eaters whilst the Panis were cowherds. That the flesh-eaters would often oppress the herdsmen can easily be understood. The Panis prepared three kinds of articles of food from the milk of their cows. Sáyana has described them as Ksheer or condensed milk, Dadhi or curd and Chrita or Clarified butter. I think the Persian Panir (cheese) is one of these three preparations. Most probably it is a modification of the first condensed milk. The article was first prepared by the Panis and so the name Panir The Panis not only made these preparations but also traded in them, and hence their love and care of cows and other cattle. Their rivals the Angiras, however, would kill the animals for the sake of their meat. Their interests were thus diametrically opposed and they fought for the cows. I hold the Angiras to have been the aggressors.

I should mention here that to make the various preparations of milk the Panis required earthen pots and therefore knew the art of pottery and other kindred arts for making the requisite tools, etc. They also knew the art of cooking. The god &quot;Chatuh Sringah&quot; that is, having four horns, was nothing but a rod for churning milk and was used for preparing clarified butter. Another instrument was named the Dasa Yantra Utsa (6-44-24) It must have been a sort of lactometer. Different Vedic scholars have explained it differently though. There is however no doubt that the Panis knew how to cook and used to take cooked food. But the Angiras simply roasted their meat and other articles of food before taking them. This operation of roasting was known by such names as Kratu and Yajna, i.e., sacrifice. It may be that particular terms were applied as the occasions were ordinary or special. The Angiras hated the Panis and called them Akratu and Ayajna (that is men who did not perform the sacrifice), as the latter were not in the habit of roasting their articles of food. On the other hand it can easily be imagined that the Panis treated the Angiras with contempt for their sacrificial observances. Such epithets as vain, arrogant, etc., applied to the Panis would show that the feeling of hatred originated with them. The hatred of the Angiras was merely reciprocal The fact that the Panis were More advanced would only confirm my theory.

 The Rivals 

In ancient times it was impossible for men to live in villages as at present. If they were afraid of the depredations of wild beasts, they were no less afraid of the outrages of human enemies which were yet more violent. For this the custom then was to live in Gosthis that is clans or communities. The Panis formed one such clan and they were further subdivided into houses or families. Each clan or house in those days lived in what is now called a Busti in the Upper Provinces of India. The bustis or localities were known as nagars or towns. The towns were protected by walls or trenches around them. I have already said that the Panis had many towns and forts and also an army. The clans of the Asuras, the Ilbis, the Ahis, the Bals, etc. were friends of the Panis and were opposed to the Angirás, the Agnis, the Bayûs, the Marûts, etc. The war they were engaged in might fittly be called the first Kurukshetra war, I believe all the rising families of ancient India took part in this great fight siding with one or the other party. and I have no doubt that branches of the Dása or the primitive families also had their share in it.

I take Agni, Bayû, Marût and others to represent different families or clans like the Panis. This I could prove not only, from the Rig Veda but from various other ancient works also. It is easy to see that the terms as used in the Suktas of the Vedas refer to men. Their present interpretation to denote natural phenomena or the elements in the various passages in which they occur in the Vedas, is more modern: the words originally meant families of men, but underwent a change in the course of time to acquire their present meaning. Professors Max Alluller, Kuhan and others have tried to fix their meaning tracing them to their root., It should be remembered that the Vedic words had already lost their original impart when their roots were formulated, and an attempt to explain them in the light subsequently obtained could not meet with unqualified success.

The Panis and their party have been mentioned as Adevas (a=no or not, and devas = gods). It is therefore not strange if their animals, and their friends have been called Devas. The word Arya is of comparatively modern origin though it, like the word Dása occurs in several Suktas, and so I cannot agree with those who hold the Vedic war 'to have been a war between Aryans and non-Ayans. The word Arya came to be applied to all the clans including the Panis, the Asuras, the Bals the Angiras and others, at a later period.

The frequent application in the Plirva (old) and nûtana (new) the Rig Veda of the words is worthy of notice, as also the mention of Indra as Yuvá -- a word used to qualify other gods also. According to Mr. Dutt, yuvá in several places young. But I think it means new to distinguish the Indra of later days from the Indra of old. The constant use of these three words -- purva, nútana and yuvá leads me to infer that the Rig Veda contains a description not of one but of two great wars one the Panik or Phoenician and the other the Asúrik or pertaining to the Asúras. The Phoenician war was the earlier of the two and it was in the days when the old rishis or sages flourished: the Asúrik war came after when new rishis appeared. The Indra who figured in the Panik war had riot the distinctive term yuvá which characterised the Indra of the Asurik war. There may be Suktas relating to other wars, but these two lasted long and were the most terrible in those old Verdic days. The Panis were not, however, the only trading people hose old Vedic days. Many other nations and races either singly or jointly all or most traded with the Panis in various parts of the then known world while some families espoused the cause of the Angiras. Perhaps vide 31, 32 and 33 of Sukta 45, mandala 6, relate regarding the Bribus. These Bribus, I think, were no other than the modern Brahui or Brahoe of Beluchistan for which reference may be made to Chamber's Encyclopaedia Vol II, or Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. III. They were skilled carpenters. The Tvastas were a branch of these Bribus, Professor Max Aluller has given an account of the Bribus in Vol. 11 of his &quot;Chips from a German Workshop&quot; According to him they were a family of carpenters from whom the Rhiblús also learnt the art. I think the Rhiblús who were allies of the Angiras learnt the art of carpentry from the Bribus who sided with the Panis. The fact is that all of them were men and not gods. vide Suktas 20 and 40 of the first mandala.

The word Pûshá is mentioned in Sukta 42 of the first Mandala and also in several other Suktas. The Angiras were not acquainted with the whereabouts of the Panis and so sought the help of the Pushas in finding them out. The Pushas were thus the guide of the Angiras. If we eliminate the more modern and the special Suktas we shall find that the Rig Veda is a history of the Panik and the Asurik wars. The gods mentioned in them were friends of one or other of the parties engaged in the wars. They were all different branches of the ancient human race and not gods of the elements, nor deified powers of Nature.

 Mutual Hostility

I have already said that the Angiras were hated by the Panis for their sacrificial rites. In fact the hatred was carried so far that the Panis appeared wherever the Angiras performed their sacrifices and caused great disturbances. The Angiras retaliated by seizing and destroying the commodities of butter and cheese of the Panis. The practice of offering up ghee or clarified butter to the sacred fire may be traced to the attempt of the Angiras to burn the ghee they obtained by Plunder from the Panis. In this act the Angiras had had the support of their friends Mitra and Varuna: vide 1-2-7 in which they invoked the latter to their help. Mercilessness in the treatment Of the fallen enemy characterised the spirit of vengeance in those &quot;remote old days. I cannot say that the humanitarian civilisation the present day is without any trace of it. The captives were then kept in dark dungeons strongly bound in chains or cords, in the custody of the Varunas who acted as gaolers and were known as Pasees or Binders. It was the duty of the latter to secure the enemies in the field of battle When conquered and put them in chains. Sometimes they would go out as pirates and surprise their enemies whom they would bring away in chains or cords. In the Suktas 24 and 25 of the first mandala the rihsi is mentioned as Súnah Sep would Sep which would appear to have been used as a general term for the Phoenician prisoners These Suktas describe how they were secured by means of pás, that is, chain or cord. The following passages will help to make me clear: -- &quot;Of the gods of various orders whose graceful name shall I utter? Who will again set me free in this wide world: that I may see my parent &quot;May he (Varuna) chastise the enemy who has pierced my heart.&quot; 1-24-28. I pray to you for long life.&quot; May the king set us at liberty.&quot; 1 24-12.

Unfasten from above, O Varuna, the upper cords that bind us down and the lower ones from below. Loosen also the ties in the middle. We shall then, 0 thou son of Aditi, live sinless without breaking thy vows.&quot; 1.24-25.

The above extracts show that those who were thus lamenting and asking for mercy did not know the gods well They only besought him for clemency who they thought could release them. It is therefore clear that lamantations who arose parties of the Adevas (no-gods) were subjected to the cruellest torture when imprisoned by their enemies.

The enemies and their houses were burnt down in retaliation: They (the Angiras) made fire with their own hands and hurled it on to the hills (the hill forts of the Panis), for the destroying fire was not there before.&quot; 2-24-7.

&quot;Thou hast burnt to ashes the robber captured from the land of the Deva.&quot; I-33-7.

Jealousy and envy brought about a difference in the customs and usages of the opposing parties. I would trace the different modes of writing from right to left and from left to right to the mutual enmity of the Devas and the Adevas -the latter writing from right to left and the former from left to right. The Panis as traders had learnt early the art of writing for which the Devas disliked them. Even the Vedas remained unwritten for many centuries and continued as Srutis being committed to memory and thus handed down from generation to generation. From an aversion to writing anything written was scorned or ridiculed as after the fashion of the Panis or Panisads. Panisad would appear to be the Greek name for Pani. Hence the name &quot; U-Panisad &quot; or &quot; Upanisad&quot; derived from a dislike to writing. In very many riks the term &quot;U&quot; or &quot;Uh&quot; has an interjectional use and is expressive of an emotion of pain or scorn. I think the word Upanisad (Upanishad), is born of scorn for the Panis. It is remarkable that the derivation of this word Upanishad is not yet satisfactorily traced A reference to the authorities extant will bear me out.

 The Date of the Panik War

On the date of the civilisation of the world must count from that date. It would at present appear, that history has not recorded any event earlier than this war, and as our early civilisation is mainly related to the Panis and their times the date of this war must be a very important factor in our researches.

I hold with the Panis that they are the first of the a civilised nations of the earth. If they were the first to see the light of civilisation, they did also, under the guidance of Providence; spread that light among various peoples in the ancient world; in fact they carried it from one country into another either to be expelled in the end or to merge themselves in the nationality of the people with whom they came in, contact. The Panis had colonies in Afghanistan, Persia, Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Greece, and their supremacy gained ground in one when it declined in another. It will be enough for me to say for the present that facts are on record which conclusively prove that the Panis at least visited all these countries for purposes of trade and they introduced India to other ancient countries of the world in those days.

Many are the adherents of the theory propounded by the Western scholars that from Central Asia the Aryans migrated to India and the other countries. It is not easy to determine exactly who these Aryans were. I am inclined to think that originally there was no nation bearing that name. The word as used in some of the riks of the Rig Veda does not appear to refer to any particular nation. The word &quot;Aryan&quot; came to be used after the Phoenician War. It is probable that the Angiras and their allies were given that name for their agricultural pursuits. This would nullify the theory of their migration from Central Asia. After the Great War the survivors of the rival parties who were left together formed into a new nation under the name of the Aryans. The word Asura has been repeatedly used in the Rig Veda, and I have already shown elsewhere that

Assyria was named after them to denote the country they lived in. After the war a branch of the great Asura clan passed over into Asia Minor and founded Assyria, In India they as well as their country had been known by the name of Asura This leads me to conclude that it was from India and not from Central Asia that the Aryans -migrated into different lands using the trading ships of the Panis in their travels- a conclusion which dispenses with the theory of their migration overland also.

The Phoenician ships sailed from the coasts of India and entered direct the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Suez, for in those remote days Suez was a strait and not an isthmus as it afterwards became through the silting up of the channel. The subsequent closure of the passage not only broke off the communication between the East and the West but also separated the Panis inhabiting the two quarters. Hence it was that long afterwards India appeared as a dream land to the ancient Greeks and other nations. The Panik War had taken place long before the strait of Suez was closed. That Suez was originally a strait will be evidenced by the facts here adduced. The present isthmus is sandy, which shows that there was a time when it formed part of the sea. Geology will bear testimony to this. The following extracts also support my view:

&quot;From hence inland to Heliopolis the country of Egypt is a spacious plain, which, though without water, and on a declivity, is a rich and sandy soil.&quot;

Herodotus. Book 11, Chap. VII.

Again: &quot;The greater part of the country (Egypt ) described above, as I was informed by the priests, (and my own observation induced me to be of the same opinion) has been a gradual acquisition to the inhabitants. The country above Memphis, between the hills before mentioned, seems formerly to have been an arm of the sea!'

Ibid. Book II, Chap X Heliopolis forms the basis of the great delta of the Nile in Egypt. To the east and the west of Heliopolis the soil is soft and clayey which conclusively proves that it has been formed by the alluvia of the Nile and that the cities of Heliopolis and Memphis stood in the olden days on the shores of the sea. It is therefore patent -that the entire land to the east and the west in a line from Heliopolis to Memphis was under the sea, the Mediterranean and the Red Seas being connected together by the Strait of Suez. In support of this I quote Prof. Pocock who says, &quot;The soil of Egypt, except what it has received from the overflowing of the Nile, is naturally sandy, it is full of nitre and salt.&quot;

I am further confirmed in my statement by Prof. Larcher, for he says: &quot;If it be true, all the country from Memphis to the sea must have been formerly a gulf of the Mediterranean parallel to the Arabian gulf, the land must have been raised up little and little from a deposit of the mud which the water of the Nile carry away with them.&quot;

All this would show that there was a time when Suez was under water through which the Phoenician vessels sailed to the Mediterranean, and Heliopolis was an important port of the Panis. It was when Suez was a branch of the sea with Heliopolis on it, or before that age even, that the great Phoenician war broke out. The union between the east and the west broke off as Suez turned into an isthmus.

The Strait of Suez had nearly silted up when Moses crossed the Red Sea and the Israelites safely passed over the shallow water. According to many Moses flourished two thousand years before Christ, and it must have taken two thousand years more for Suez to have filled up. The fact that Heliopolis had then fallen into decay before the growing fame of Memphis, would support this theory. It is said that Menes, the first king of Memphis, founded the city more than four thousand years before Christ, and according to the Greeks the gods of the name of Helios reigned in Egypt long before that date extending over a period of about fourteen thousand years. There can be no doubt that these rulers of Heliopolis, the so called gods Helios, were none other than the Pani of old Heliopolis therefore must have fallen into ruins at least four thousand, if not six thousand years before Christ. It should be noted here that Heliopolis was the cradle of the Egyptian civilisation of which, the Panis were undoubtedly the originators.

According to the Western scholars the Rig Veda was composed in 2000 B.C. As I have already shown the Phoenician war to have taken place in 4000 BC the Rig Veda may safely be assumed to have been 'composed about that time. It should be remembered that the great Book took many years to compile and it is not improbable that a number of the Suktas were composed in 4000 B.C. I would even say that the Pauranic or Poetic Age began two thousand years before Christ. It is not therefore unlikely that the historical part of the Rig Veda was anterior to the Pauranic age by another two thousand years. Mr. Tilak, the well known Mahratta scholar, has, in explaining the astronomical import of a particular Sukta, demonstrated that the Rig Veda was composed six or seven thousand years before Christ. The Phoenician war, as recorded in the Rig Veda, may therefore be referred to a date at least six or seven thousand years before the Christian era, if not earlier.

 Conclusion

With a few words more I shall conclude the subject. In every nation or race, old or new, civilised or uncivilised, war-songs have been handed down from generation to generation. The small stock of songs that the wild hill tribes possess is only a collection of war-songs Colonel Todd's history of Rajasthan is based on such songs. In fact the songs of Bháts or eulogists, so well known in this country were current even in the Vedic age, and I have no hesitation in affirming that in war-songs and songs of victory the Rig Veda had its origin, at least they form the bulk of the great work. The old war songs of ancient India composed the true Rig Veda and many other songs on various subjects came to be added to them I subsequently The Rig Veda is thus not a collection of hymn and anthems but of war songs recording the primitive history of the world. It may therefore be concluded that the first history of each nation or race of man began with war songs.

I have in the previous section already mentioned the city of Heliopolis of Egypt. In Greek &quot;Heliopolis&quot; means &quot;the city of the sun. In India also there was an ancient city of that name which would appear to have belonged to some family of the Panis. A city or town in those days would be named after the family or clan that inhabited it, and so the clan of the Heliopolis named their towns after their own wherever they went. This I conclude from the name Ilibis which occurs in the Rig Veda, the word being only another form of Heliopolis. All the towns of the name of Heliopolis -in India, in Egypt, or elsewhere were founded by the llibis.

Modern Morea in Greece had for its ancient name Peloponnesus which I think originally meant palli or residence of the Panis. That Greece was not unknown to the people of ancient India has been very ably shown by Prof. Pococke in his work &quot;India in Greece.&quot; In fact the fame of India was carried throughout the ancient world by such races as the Ilibis, the Panis, the Bals, the Asuras and others.

If may be safely affirmed that Balkh, Baalbek and other ancient cities bearing similar names were founded by the Bals. We know from the Rig Veda itself that the north west of ancient India was inhabited by these races who used to fight amongst themselves. The Rig Veda is therefore not only a history of ancient India but of the antire ancient world, and so the whole human race is interested in its correct and proper exposition. And as more light is thrown on the subject new truths will be discovered in the various branches of human knowledge. For this purpose it is necessary that the great work should be translated in the different languages of the world.

When in the old days the isthmus of Suez was a strait connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean not only was there an exchange of merchandise between the countries on either side but also of thoughts and experiences. With the closing up of the passage such exchange ceased and the nations and races grew up independently each in its own way, the western nations making rapid progress in material prosperity and the eastern in spiritual. Many centuries after Suez has again been opened up to renew the lost connection between the east and the west to fulfil the purposes of a beneficent Providence.

As Bháts or eulogists in the present days sing in praise of heroes and dynasties, so in the old days the Rig Veda was sung by the Rishis or sages and the assembled people heard with rapture the glories of their forefathers. In explanation of the discontinuance of the Vedic songs and psalms in India I can only say what I myself think on the subject. In many places of the Rig Veda mention is made of bovine food which the antagonists of the Panis were in the habit of taking. I am not sure if the word at first meant cattle generally, but it is certain that subsequently it represented the cows only. And it is easy to conceive how the study of the Rig Veda came to be interdicted as containing obnoxious passages when cow-killing was considered a great sin at least in the Pauranic age. In fact the Rig Veda fell into disuse with the introduction of the worship of the cow, nay the unfortunate householder who dared to possess the work was cursed to death from thunder and lightning. The result was that at last not only the doomed Rig Veda, but the entire Vedas fell into oblivion leaving behind only an unshaken veneration for them in the minds of people of the country.

Professor Sergi holds that the ancient civilisation of Europe is derived from the coasts of Mediterranean and he doesn't accept the theory that the Aryan civilization was the first and most ancient in the scale. I believe I have been able to show in this examination of the Rig Vida -- which is a repository of facts not action -- that it was not from Central Asia, as is ordinary supposed, but from India -- the land of Ilibis, the Panis, the Asuras, the Angiras and others -- that the light of civilisation spread far and wide to wake up the whole world to progress and enlightenment.

 Appendix

The Phoenicians derived their name from Phoenicia, meaning the inhabitants of Phoenicia. The diphthong oe in the word shows that with the sound of o (as in order) it should read as Phonicia and with the sound of e as Phënicia. It is thus clear that by some the word was pronounced as Phënicia, and Phonicia had its origin in Phonis. The pronunciation of P and Ph are so closely allied that it is not unoften that the one takes the place of the other Ph is P hard. The conclusion therefore is that Panis is only a different form of Phonis and the Panis of old were known as the Phoenicians in later days. In fact the word Phoenician has sprung from the word Panis which was the original name of the race. The country inhabited by the Panis came to be known as Pânisé Pânisia -- transformed into Phönicia or Phoenicia, and as time went on the inhabitants of Phoenicia were called Phoenicians instead of Panis.

Two eminent scholars of the day have already expressed their opinion off the subject of this treatise regarding the historical aspect of the vedas. I append them below as they may encourage others like me in this interesting study.

1. Translation of a letter in Bengali addressed to the author by Mr. R. C. Dutt, member of the Indian Civil Service:

I have read your assay on the Panic War. I am glad to see the scholarship and research you have brought to bear on the subject.

I see nothing improbably in the theory that there was a race called Pani or Panis, that the Indian Aryan seized their cows and that many of the suktas of the Rig Veda were composed to record historical events. In fact your exposition seems more plausible than that of Prof. Max Muller. But I am unable to decide which of these two expositions is correct: indeed I cannot say if it is possible to come to a decision on the subject after so many thousand years.

To what nation or race did the Panis belong, if they were really men? You say they were Phoenicians. A good many proofs are wanted before the statement can be accepted. That the Phoenicians always came to ancient India by the land route: that they quarreled and fought with the Indian Aryans, and that the latter knew them as Panis: or, that the Phoenicians have in their own works mentioned the Aryans living on the banks of the Indus -- these are conclusions which require to be amply demonstrated. I do not say that your theory is a groundless one, but still it is only a theory for the present. Hundreds of hill tribes inhabited Afghanistan, and it s not improbable that they quarrelled with the Indian Aryans for cattle (cows), and that some of them were referred to as the Panis in the Suktas of the Vedas.

I cannot accept your meaning of the word Saramá as correct. It may be taken to mean the Dawn even if the word Pani signifies some hill tribe or a trading people -- &quot;at dawn of day the Aryans discovered the concealed cows and recovered them with the help of Indra.&quot;

There can however be no doubt that the word go means cows if your interpretation of the word Pani be correct.

Sd. Romesh Chunder Dutt
May 1, 1902

[The Phoenicians dwelt in some part of Afghanistan long before they colonised Phoenicia, and the wars described in the Vedas refer to those days. Defeated in those wars or for some other reasons they migrated westward and founded the colony of Phoenicia. Or it may be that Phoenicia was their principal colony in those remote Vedic days, and after their defeat in the wars referred to in the sacred books they removed there for good. Mr. Dutt's suggestion, therefore, that the Phoenicians came to India by land, is not borne out by my conclusions -- Author.]

2. The following appeared in the columns of the Indian Mirror (Calcutta), of the 22nd May 1902, from the pen of the eminent Sanscrit scholar Prof. Satis Chandra Acharya Vidyabhusan M. A. of the Presidency College (Calcutta):

&quot; It was nearly ten years ago that I marked with surprise several passages in the Rig Veda (as for instance, in Mandala VI, Sukta 53) where the word Pani repeatedly occurred. Looking into the commentary of Sayanacharya, I found the word Pani interpreted as Vaninj, a merchant. In the Chapter on Unádi suffixes in Panini's Sanskrit Grammar, the word Vanij was found to be derived from the root Pan. I then suspected that the word Pani, meaning a merchant and occurring in the Rig Veda, might refer to the Phoenician race. Eventually I gave expression to the fact in several places, and lately in the introduction to my edition of Kachchayana's Pali Grammar. I expressed my view on the subject With great diffidence. Now I am very glad to find my view confirmed by our learned friend; Babu Rajeswar Gupta, Head Master of the Rangpore Normal School, and Editor of Anjali, who has published a long and interesting article on the subject in the Chaitra number of his journal. The article is an admirable one and is a product of deep researches into the Vedic literature. It reflects great credit on the scholarship of the writer and has brought to light some very important facts of earliest history.&quot;

- An encounter with history -

By Carlos Malem

50 kilometres from Damascus, at an altitude of more than 1500 metres, in the direction of Lebanon, Maalula perches on the slopes of the Kalamun Mountains as if it were in reality a gigantic bee-hive on the edge of a precipice. The landscape is bathed in an unreal luminosity. A vast gleaming carpet of green is found at the base of the mountains made up of figs, flowering damsons, grapevines and poplar trees ill at ease with the presence of tiny birds......This exceptionally hospitable village seems to float above implacable nature. Maalula has a mellowness of character which it has known how to preserve during its many centuries. It is now many years since the early days, when it was a settlement in the Homs kingdom..... or during the Roman era when it was called Seliocopolis.  

Maalula will always be an authentic encounter with history. Nowadays it has a population of 2,000. The peaceful and hardworking inhabitants devote themselves to the fundamental task of living in dignity. A hardworking atmosphere does not mask the principal preoccupation, that of preserving its language, its traditions and its rich history. The least mysterious way of safeguarding a necessary future. From the moment of arrival, the visitor has the sensation of having been transported into a magical world where the things that happen to the characters follow each other at a fierce rhythm. The first thing that touches the spirit is the beauty of the faces, the great charm of the orient. But later there are the gestures and smiles that permit one to perceive the natural disposition that the Maalulis possess to convey what at first sight seems invisible. Maalula is above all a facet of the sensual world. Maalula is a place of images: images that devour and tear the observer to pieces; rude, coarse, perfect, sublime images that cannot be evaded. Maalula is the vines creeping through the balconies. A peasant drinking the best home-made arak in the world. And always the young Maaluli girls with their sun-drenched bodies. But Maalula is also a winter of hungry snow. Maalula is an unforgettable blueness.  

The Aramaeans  

The inhabitants of Maalula are the natural descendants of those Semitic tribes which populated the Syrian desert and part of Mesopotamia 14 centuries before our time. Old manuscripts reveal that these tribes went by the name of Aramu or Ahlamu. The Aramaeans were in reality composed of a multitude of kingdoms which did not have strong ties of union between themselves. Towards the year 1000, the Aramaeans occupied a vast territory which extended as far as the banks of the Euphrates. But the power of its armies was systematically weakened by the assaults of the kings of Assur. Decadence started to become apparent. The different principalities and Aramaean kingdoms were incapable of co-ordinating their efforts and were defeated one by one. Arpat, Cobah and Hamat lost control of their possessions. The Assyrians won. In the year 730 BC their luck had run out and Assur formed the border with Egypt..  

Aramaic, The Language of the Future  

The Aramaic language was the main language used for intercommunication between the Semitic peoples in the ancient middle east. Around the 8th century BC, the empire of the Aramaic language extended from Egypt to remote and isolated regions in Asia. The first documentary evidence of the Aramaic language was found on the tomb of king Kilamu (4th - 8th century BC), or in Neirab on the funeral remains of the Moon god south of Aleppo.  

As of the 7th century AD, Aramaic was used throughout the Assyrian empire. Furthermore, the Persians adopted Aramaic as their official language around the 5th century BC. Writing with alphabetic characters spread rapidly. The book of Esdras shows us that Aramaic was also used in Palestine. Once the size of the Persian empire had increased, the use of Aramaic became universal. Documents found in India (3rd century BC) show that Aramaic was used throughout Asia Minor. The Jews of Palestine used Aramaic until the second century AD. After the finding of the Qumran manuscripts on the banks of the Dead Sea, the overall opinion about spoken and written Aramaic has been noticeably modified and it is possible that it will continue to be modified in proportion to other discoveries of this type which come to light. In any case, it is a language in full development, rich and dynamic. It is clear that the words of Christ were disseminated in Aramaic because it was the language spoken and written by him and his disciples. What we today call Syrian is in reality a dialect of Aramaic spoken in Mesopotamia (nowadays known as Urfa in Turkey), which later became the language of the Christians in Syria. At the same time, pressure was exerted on Syriac by the Arabic invaders especially after the 5th century AD. Syriac succumbed to this pressure in the end. The Arabs won the battle. However some pockets of resistance still exist. Maalula is an example of this. It is very difficult to know with any certainty if Syriac will have an assured future. In any case it is hoped that Syriac will become a language of the future. It comes as no surprise that there is a feeling of solidarity among the people who currently speak it:- the Jacobists of Turkey, the mountain dwellers of Mosuk (Iraq), the Nestorians and the Caldeos. The distinction between Eastern Syriac and Western Syriac (the latter is spoken in Maalula) also appear in the written script. Eastern Syriac uses the old uncial characters, or in other words it is written in capital letters whereas western Syriac is written in italics. Regrettably, in Maalula there is currently an almost complete loss of Syriac script. It is to be hoped that some of the young people, who have a strong respect for the culture of their elders, will assume the task of reintroducing the Syriac script into daily life.  



Inventory of Historic Monuments  

The past, which is present at every turn in Maalula, is found in the Monastery of Mar Sarkis (Saint Sergius). The monastery was built in the fourth century on the ruins of a pagan temple. It's Byzantine style and lean shapes contain one of the first Christian altars. Since its construction until the present day, this monastery has been used as a place of worship which gives it an even greater sense of mystery. The monastery owns a very interesting collection of religious icons from the 16th to the 18th century; among which the most noteworthy are: the beautiful icon of the Virgin Mary and another of the martyrs Sergius and Bakhos. Furthermore, the monks have inscribed some prayers in Western Aramaic for the visitors. This monastery was named in honour of Saint Sarkis who died as a martyr during the reign of Maximillian. On the road that leaves the the village there is a steep path on the right that leads to a terrace where a small waterfall welcomes the pilgrims. Here we find ourselves in the Convent of Mar Tekla, of the orthodox faith. The building was constructed on several levels which gives it a sumptuous feel. Following the stairs, we arrive on the top floor where we find a modern church with a dome and a cave into which filters water with miraculous properties. This curious religious monument receives an unending stream of devotion not only from Christian pilgrims but also from many Moslems who are convinced of its holiness. The convent jealously guards the remains of Saint Tekla, daughter of prince Seljukida, a follower of Saint Peter. Other religious relics can be found in the convent but what strikes one most is the peaceful atmosphere of the place. It offers an unbeatable opportunity to meditate and enter into a communion with the beauty of the landscape. It is also worth mentioning that there is a mosque.  

Festivals and Commemorations  

The Maalulas have a collection of religious and festive songs that are unique in their variety and imagination. They have a great sense of community and festivity. There are three big folklore festivals which mark out the year for the inhabitants of this wonderful place. The first is on 14th September to pay tribute to Saint Cross, there is another on 22nd September which is the festival of Mar Tekla and on the 7th October there is the festival of Mar Sarkis. Hundreds of visitors attend these celebrations and they enjoy some of the most imaginative festivals in the whole of Syria.  

How to get to Maalula.  

There is no international airport in Maalula so it is preferable to fly to Damascus and catch the minibus which takes approximately 1 hour. To get to the minibus station, catch a bus from Choukri Kouatli Avenue in the direction of Kabun and get off at the Abassidas Square next to the football stadium. Go down the Boulevard of Nassirah and keep going until you find the minibus station for Maalula. It's impossible to get lost. The minibuses don't have a fixed timetable and they leave when they are full. The last minibus, in both directions, is at 5pm. The drivers are extremely kind. If on your journey you are lucky enough to be driven by Elias Malem don't forget to send him the regards of his cousin Carlos (a price reduction of the fare is almost guaranteed).  

Where to stay  

There is only one four-star hotel which is the Hotel Safir. It has a restaurant, bars and a swimming pool. It was built in 1988 right next to the Mar Sarkis Monastery. It has magnificent views and gives very good service. It is well worth it if you can afford the expense. It costs approximately 85 dollars per room. For those with more limited budgets it is a good idea to stay in Damascus and travel there each day. On the other hand there are several places where you can eat well without spending too much.

Un lugar llamado Maalula 

- una cita con la historia -

Por Carlos Malem

A 50 kilómetros de Damasco, y a más de 1500 metros de altura, en dirección del Líbano, Maalula se recuesta sobre los Montes Kalamun como si en realidad se tratara de una gigantesca colmena al borde del precipicio. Este pueblo, excepcionalmente acogedor, flota sobre una naturaleza implacable. El paisaje está ampliamente impregnado de una luminosidad irreal. Una vasta extensión de verdes relampaguean en la base de los montes... higueras, damascos en flor, álamos incómodos por la presencia de minúsculos pájaros aguerridos, viñas... Una suavidad de carácter que Maalula ha sabido preservar a lo largo de sus siglos. Lejos de sus primeros pasos, cuando este caserio formaba parte del Reino de Homs... o cuando durante la época romana se llamaba Seliócopolis.  

Maalula será siempre una auténtica cita con la historia. Hoy en día este pueblo cuenta con unos 2000 habitantes. Una población pacífica y laboriosa entregada a la tarea elemental de vivir dignamente. Una atmósfera de trabajo que no enturbia su vocación primera, la de preservar su lengua, sus tradiciones; y su rica historia. La manera menos misteriosa de salvaguardar un futuro necesario. Desde su llegada el viajero tiene la sensación de haber sido transportado a un mundo mágico donde los personajes se suceden unos a otros a una cadencia feroz. Lo primero que viene al espíritu es la belleza de los rostros; el gran encanto de ese Oriente. Pero luego son los gestos y la sonrisa que permiten adivinar la natural disposición que poseen los maalulis para comunicar lo que es invisible a simple vista. Maalula es ante todo un aspecto del mundo sensual. Maalula es un espacio de imágenes. Imágenes que devoran, que trituran al observador. Imágenes sin escapatoria, rudas, perfectas, sublimes. Maalula son las viñas derritiéndose a través de los balcones. Un campesino bebiendo el mejor arak casero del mundo. Y siempre esas jóvenes maalulis con los cuerpos inundados de sol. Pero Maalula es también un invierno de nieves hambrientas... Maalula es un azul inolvidable.  

Los arameos  

Los habitantes de Maalula son los herederos naturales de aquellas tribus semitas que en el siglo XIV antes de nuestra era poblaban el desierto sirio y parte de la Mesopotamia. Inscripciones antiguas dan cuenta de estas tribus bajo el nombre de Aramu o Ahlamu. Los arameos estaban en realidad organizados en una multitud de reinos sin lazos fuertes de unión. Hacia el año 1000 los arameos ocupan un vasto territorio qua alcanza las orillas del Eufrates. Pero el poderío de sus ejércitos es sistemáticamente debilitado por los asaltos de los reyes de Assur. La decadencia comienza a llamar a sus puertas. Los diferentes principados y reinos arameos, incapaces de coordinar sus esfuerzos, van siendo derrotados uno a uno. Arpat, Cobah, Hamat pierden el control de sus posesiones. Los asirios vencen. Prácticamente en el año 730 antes de Cristo la suerte queda echada, Assur llama a la frontera de Egipto.  

El arameo, la lengua del futuro  

La lengua aramea constituye en la antiguedad del Medio Oriente el lazo de comunicación preponderante entre los pueblos semitas. Alrededor del siglo VIII a. de C. prácticamente el imperio de la lengua aramea se extiende desde Egipto hasta regiones muy apartadas de Asia. Los primeros testimonios en lengua aramea se hallan sobre la tumba del rey Kilamu (siglos IX-VIII a. de C.), o en Neirab sobre las estelas funerarias del dios Luna al sur de Alepo.  

A partir del siglo VII a. de C. el arameo es utilizado en todo el Imperio Asirio. Hacia el año 500 a. de C. también los persas adoptan el arameo como lengua &quot;oficial&quot;. La escritura con caracteres alfabéticos se extiende rápidamente. El libro de Esdras nos muestra que el arameo también es utilizado en Palestina. Una vez que el Imperio Persa se extiende el arameo se generaliza. Documentos encontrados en la India (siglo III a. de C.) nos muestran que el arameo se utilizaba en toda Asia Menor. Los judios de Palestina utilizan el arameo hasta el siglo II d. de C. Luego del hallazgo de los manuscritos de Qumran a orillas del Mar Muerto la visión del arameo hablado y escrito se ha modificado sensiblemente; y es posible que siga modificándose a medida que otros descubrimientos de ese tipo salgan a la luz. En todo caso se trata de una lengua en plena evolución, rica y dinámica. Nos queda claro que la palabra cristiana fue difundida por Cristo y sus discipulos en arameo; idioma hablado y escrito por ellos. Lo que hoy llamamos siriaco es en realidad un dialecto del arameo hablado en Mesopotamia (y en lo que hoy es Urfa, Turquía), y que luego se convirtió en la lengua de los cristianos de Siria. A su vez, el siriaco sufre la presión de los invasores árabes sobre todo a partir del siglo V de nuestra era. El siriaco termina por sucumbir. Los árabes ganan por esta vez la batalla. Ello no obstante algunos focos de resistencia subsisten... Maalula es un ejemplo de ello. Es muy difícil aventurarse sobre un pronóstico para saber si el siriaco (que unos llaman siriani, arameo o neoarameo; y otros asirio ) tendrá un futuro asegurado. En todo caso es de esperar que el siriaco se convierta en la lengua del futuro. No sorprende que un sentimiento de solidaridad entre gentes que hablan una misma lengua se haga sentir actualmente. Entre los jacobistas de Turquía, los montañeses asirios de Mosul (Irak), los nestorianos y caldeos que viven aún en Irán... La distinción entre siriaco oriental y siriaco occidental (este último hablado en Maalula) aparece también en la escritura. El siriaco oriental utiliza los viejos caracteres unciales, es decir una escritura en mayúsculas; mientras que la escritura del siriaco occidental es más bien cursiva. Lamentablemente en Maalula asistimos actualmente a una pérdida casi por completo de la escritura siriaca. Es de desear que algunos jóvenes impreganados de la cultura de sus mayores asuman un día la grata misión de reintroducir la escritura siriaca en la vida cotidiana.  

Inventario de monumentos históricos  

El pasado, presente en cada rincón de Maalula encuentra en el Monasterio de Mar Sarkis (San Sergio) un testigo de lujo. El monasterio fue construido en el siglo IV sobre las ruinas de un templo pagano. De estilo bizantino y formas despojadas guarda en su seno uno de los primeros altares cristianos. Desde su construcción hasta la fecha este monasterio ha sido utilizado como lugar de culto; lo que le confiere un soplo de misterio aún mayor. El monasterio es propietario de una interesantísima colección de íconos religiosos de los siglos XVI al XVIII; entre los que se destacan un bello ícono de la Santa Virgen Maria y otro de los mártires Sergio y Bakhos. Además los monjes de monasterio han grabado algunas oraciones en arameo occidental a la intención de los visitantes. Este monasterio fue así llamado en honor de San Sarkis, caído en mártir durante el reinado de Maximianos. Saliendo del pueblo; y a la derecha de la ruta, se encuentra un camino escarpado que conduce a una terraza donde una pequeña cascada da la bienvenida al peregrino. Estamos en el Convento de Mar Tekla, de rito ortodoxo. El edificio fue construído sobre varios pisos lo que le confiere una presencia suntuosa. Siguiendo las escalaras llegamos al último piso donde nos aguardan una iglesia moderna con cúpula y una gruta que deja filtrar un agua que ha dado prueba de prodigios. Curioso monumento religioso que recibe incesantes muestras de devoción, no sólo de peregrinos cristianos; sino además de muchos musulmanes convencidos de la santidad del lugar. El convento guarda celosamente los restos de Santa Tecla, hija de un principe Seljukida, y adepto de San Pablo. Otros vestigios de la vida religiosa pasada se atesoran en el convento. Pero lo que sin duda atrae al curioso es la paz del lugar. Una ocasión insuperable para meditar y entrar en comunión con la belleza del paisaje. Algunas otras iglesias, quizá menos prestigiosas, atestiguan de un fervor religioso intacto. Cabe también destacar la existencia de una mezquita.  

Fiestas y conmemoraciones  

Los maalulis atesoran, oralmente, un cancionero religioso-festivo único por su variedad e imaginacion. Y desde luego un gran sentido comunitario y festivo. Tres grandes fiestas folklóricas ritman la vida de los habitantes de este magnífico lugar. El 14 de septiembre en honor de la Santa Cruz. El 22 de septiembre fiesta de Mar Tekla. Y el 7 de Octubre fiesta de Mar Sarkis. Durante esos días centenas de turistas acuden a gozar de uno de los festivales más imaginativos de toda Siria.

Cómo llegar a Maalula  

No existe por el momento un aeropuerto internacional en Maalula por lo cual es preferible utilizar el de Damasco. El trayecto desde Damasco en minibus dura aproximadamente una hora. Para llegar a la estación de minibuses coger en la Avenida Choukri el Kouatli un autobus en dirección a Kabun; y bajarse en la Plaza de los Abassidas del lado del Estadio de Fútbol. Coger el bulevar de Nassirah, y continuar hasta encontrar la estación de minibuses para Maalula. Imposible perderse. Los minibuses no tienen horario fijo y salen cuando están completos. El servicio se interrumpe a la 5 de la tarde en uno y otro sentido. Los choferes son de una amabilidad sin fisura. Si durante el trayecto tiene la suerte de ser conducido por Elias Malem, uno de los choferes más demostrativos de la empresa, no deje de saludarlo de parte de su primo Carlos (una reducción sobre el precio del pasaje está casi asegurada).  

Dónde alojarse  

Existe en Maalula un solo hotel de categoria superior. El Safir Hotel (****) cuenta con restaurante, bares y piscina. Construido en 1988, justo al lado del Monasterio de Mar Sarkis. Vista magnífica y servicio bastante esmerado. Vale la pena para aquellos que puedan pagarlo. Aproximadamente 85 dólares la habitación. Para presupuestos más modestos conviene alojarse en Damasco y hacer el trayecto a diario. En cambio existen múltiples lugares donde comer correctamente sin gastar demasiado.

The Phoenicians were probably Semitic -- neither Europeans nor Africans
Before going into the long and, sometimes, controversial origin of the Phoenicians, two things musts be made clear. The Phoenicians do not have their origin in Europe or in Africa. They were neither European nor where they black Africans. Their origin is probably Semitic though some references trace them back to as far away as India about 10,000 BC. Further, the Phoenician colonies which spread all over the coastline of the Mediterranean and even the Atlantic coasts were inhabited by Phoenician Semitic immigrants. No one can claim that the Phoenicians of North Africa were black or the Phoenicians of Spain, Gibraltar, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta...etc. were European. Statues, bursts, and artwork of the Phoenicians are found all over this website and upon close observation one can clearly see how closely they resemble the inhabitants of the shores of present day Mediterranean. (Note the images of the young Phoenician man and woman below). There are some who use the Bible for genealogical reference and actually believe Biblical characters such as Noah, Shem, Ham...etc. really existed and thereafter the Semites came from Shem and the Hamites from Ham...etc. These claims are categorically rejected and have no basis in purely scientific genealogical studies of ethnic origins and races. The Bible is about religion and many parts of the Old Testament should be looked at in that light. The Bible should not be taken as li

Phoenician origin of the Celts?
Excerpts from studies and conclusions are herewith provided as mere speculations that the Phoenicians were the ancestors of the Celts and who displaced the Picts.

Ethnic Origin and Language
The Phoenicians probably arrived in the eastern Mediterranean about 3000 B.C., however, nothing is known of their original homeland for sure. What may be the most applied hypothesis of the ethnic origin of these people is Semitic, though some studies, according to Irish records, suggest that they descend from a Scythian King named Phoeniusa Farsa...according to the Irish this kings' descendents eventually populated the country of Phoenicia and named the country in his honor...Phoeniusa son; other studies trace their origin to a very distant past in India where they were closely associated with the Aryans. This somewhat controversial study by Rajeswar Gupta is published in full as originally translated from Bengali. It is based on the ancient Rig Veda and puts forth the following suggestions regarding the origin of the Phoenicians:

A great war broke out in the remote old days (maybe 10,000 B.C.) between the Indian Aryans and the Phoenicians in which the latter were defeated and compelled to leave wholly or partially the land of the Aryans. 
The Phoenicians were the first of the civilized nations of the world. The civilization of Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, Greece and other ancient countries owed its origin to the union of the civilization of the Aryans with that of the Phoenicians. 
The Phoenicians originally lived in some part of India, whence driven out they migrated gradually westwards. While still residing in the neighborhood of India they colonized and traded with Arabia and the countries bordering on the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. 
The Phoenicians had colonies in many countries from each of which they were driven away by the natives after severe struggles. In this way they were expelled from India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, or they mixed with the natives when they lost their supremacy in those countries. 
In ancient time the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea were connected together by a strait through which the Phoenician and Aryan trading ships entered the Mediterranean Sea and Indian goods were taken to Europe. As that passage gradually silted up the connection between India and Europe broke off. 
It must be noted that historians and archaeologist do theorize about supposed various origins of the Phoenicians with little hard evidence and one is left with nothing more than mere hypotheses.

The Phoenician, as a people, even though they may come from Semitic origin or from India, did survive the ages as an ethnically pure race. Invading Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonian, Hittites, Persians, Macedonians, Greeks, and Romans, in addition to many others, added genetic material and culture to the Phoenicians. They in turn through their trade and frequent contact with cultures and races of the Mediterranean world added new dimensions to their stock from lands as close as Cyprus or as far as Spain or even Britain.

A form of Aramaic was the language of the Phoenicians. It was a Semitic language of the Northern Central, or Northwestern, group that was originally spoken in Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and neighboring towns and in other areas of the Mediterranean colonized by Phoenician people known as Aramaeans. It was most closely related to Hebrew, Syriac, and Moabite which were written in a script derived from the Phoenician alphabet. The earliest Phoenician inscription deciphered dates probably from the 11th century BC; the latest inscription from Phoenicia proper is from the 1st century BC, when the language was already being superseded by Aramaic proper.

They are part of the full service in Aramaic which was held in Maalula, Syria (a town which were Aramaic is still spoken today), 1994, for the first time in 300 years. The Melkite Greek Catholic Patriachal Office of the Cathechism holds the copyright and is indebted for providing this rare service.

In addition to being used in Phoenicia, the language spread to many of its colonies. In one, the North African city of Carthage, a later stage of the language, known as Pun which was influenced by the Barber, became the language of the Carthaginian empire. Phoencian survived in use as a vernacular in some of the smaller cities of North Africa at least until the time of St. Augustine, bishop of Hippo (5th century AD) and continued to be used by North African peasants until the 6th century AD.

Phoenician words are found in Greek and Latin classical literature as well as in Egyptian, Akkadian, and Hebrew writings. The language is written with a 22-character alphabet that does not indicate vowels.

The Byblos Syllabic texts is the earliest known example of mixing a Semitic language with modified Egyptian hieroglyphic characters. It appeared as an inscriptions (eighteenth century A.D.), from the city of Byblos on the Phoenician coast. This script is described as a &quot;syllabary [that] is clearly inspired by the Egyptian hieroglyphic system, and in fact is the most important link known between the hieroglyphs and the Canaanite alphabet.&quot;

During the period of the Roman Empire the native Phoenician language died out and was replaced by Aramaic as the vernacular. Latin, the language of the soldiers and administrators, in turn fell before Greek, the language of letters of the eastern Mediterranean, by the 5th century AD.

Literature and Thought -- Suggestions
With respect to the extent and range of the Phoenician book literature, the little that can be gathered from the notices remaining to us in the Greek and Roman writers is the following. In Phoenicia Proper there were historical writers at least from the time of Hiram, the contemporary of David, who wrote the annals of their country in a curt dry form somewhat resembling that of Kings and Chronicles.[1] The names of the kings and the length of their reigns were carefully recorded, together with some of the more remarkable events belonging to each reign; but there was no attempt at the philosophy of history, nor at the graces of composition. In some places, especially at Sidon, philosophy and science were to a certain extent cultivated. Mochus, a Sidonian, wrote a work on the atomic theory at a very early date, though scarcely, as Posidonius maintained,[2] one anterior to the Trojan war. Later on, the Sidonian school specially affected astronomy and arithmetic, in which they made so much progress that the Greeks acknowledged themselves their debtors in those branches of knowledge. It is highly probable, though not exactly capable of proof, that the Tyrian navigators from a very remote period embodied in short works the observations which they made in their voyages, on the geography, hydrography, ethology, and natural history of the counties, which were visited by them. Hanno's &quot;Periplus&quot; may have been composed on a model of these earlier treatises, which at a later date furnished materials to Marinus for his great work on geography. It was, however, in the Phoenician colony of Carthage that authorship was taken up with most spirit and success. Hiempsal, Hanno, Mago, Hamilcar, and others, composed works, which the Romans valued highly, on the history, geography, and &quot;origines&quot; of Africa, and also upon practical agriculture. Mago and Hamilcar were regarded as the best authorities on the latter subject both by the Greeks and Romans, and were followed, among the Greeks by Mnaseas and Paxamus,[3,4] among the Romans by Varro and Columella. So highly was the work of Mago, which ran to twenty-eight books, esteemed, that, on the taking of Carthage, it was translated into Latin by order of the Roman Senate. After the fall of Carthage, Tyre and Sidon once more became seats of learning; but the Phoenician language was discarded, and Greek adopted in its place. The Tyrian, Sidonian, Byblian and Berytian authors, of whom we hear, bear Greek names. Philo of Byblus and Marinus of Tyre are the only two authors of this later period who held to Phoenician traditions, and, presumably, conveyed on to later ages Phoenician ideas and accumulations. If neither literature nor science gained much from the work of the former, that of the latter had considerable value, and, as the basis of the great work of Ptolemy, must ever hold an honourable place in the history of geographical progress.[5,6,7,8]

Literature of Phoenicia
Phoenician inscriptions, both from the Phoenician coast and from other areas of the eastern Mediterranean are very limited in genre, and relatively few are more than a few lines long with very minor exceptions.

Uninscribed materials from excavated sites supplement the picture. However, criteria for identifying literary or religious materials have not always been carefully considered. It is often difficult to correlate with confidence written and unwritten materials.

Despite growing knowledge, the resulting picture is still very irregular. While there is an unparalleled variety of sources, covering a century and a half, from the large cosmopolitan city of Ugarit, other written materials give a much more limited picture. For many periods, areas, and topics there are no written remains. Descriptions are extremely limited and superficial. Generalizations about the eastern Mediterranean may well prove to have significant exceptions as some of these gaps are filled by new discoveries. However, some exceptions have surfaced as indicated below.

Ugaritic Narrative Poetry
More than 500 years before the Odyssey and the Iliad, before the biblical books of Genesis or Job, Canaanite Phoenician masters of the epic lived and wrote on the Mediterranean coast.

Following are minor excerpts from some of the Ugaritic Narrative Poetry translated into English and edited by Simon B. Parker.

From The Rapiuma, translated by Theodore J. Lewis


Behold your son, behold...
Your grandson, your shrine; 


Behold ... your hand.
The small one will kiss your lips. 


There, shoulder to shoulder.
Brothers, attendants of El... 


There mortals .. the name of El,
... heroes bless the name of El. 


There the shades of Baal ...
Warriors of Baal
Warriors of Anat. 


There armed forces encircle
The eternal royal princes 


As when Anat hastens to the hunt
Sets to flight the birds of the heavens. 


They slaughtered oxen; sheep as well;
They felled bulls, fatlings too, 


Also rams and year old calves,
They butchered lambs ad even kids. 


Olive oil -- like silver to travelers,
... -- like gold to travelers. 


... a table set with fruit,
Laid with fruit fit for kings, 


Day long they pour the wine,
... must-wine, fit for rulers. 


Wine, sweet and abundant,
Select wine... 


The choice wine of Lebanon,
Must nurtured by El. 


One day passes, then a second,
The shades eat, the drink; 


A third day, then a fourth;
A fifth day, then a sixth;
The shades eat, they drink. 


To the banquet house on the summit,
... in the heart of Lebanon. 

From The Epic of Kirta, translated by Edward L. Greenstein


&quot;What too me is silver, or even yellow gold,
Together with its land and slaves forever mine? 


A Triad of chariot horses
From the stables of a slave woman's son? 


What is not in my house you must give me:
You must give me Lady Huraya,
The Fair One, your firstborn child! 


Who is as fair as the goddess Anath,
Who is as comely as Astarte; 


Whose eyes are lapis lazuli
Eyeballs, gleaming alabaster; 


Whom El has given in my dream,
The Father of Man in my vision; 


Who will bear a child for Kirta
A lad for the Servant of El.&quot; 

Sanchuniathon, Phoenician writer
(fl. 14th/13th century BC?), ancient Phoenician writer. All information about him is derived from the works of Herennius Philo of Byblos (flourished AD 100). Excavations at Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) in Syria in 1929 revealed Phoenician documents supporting much of Sanchuniathon's information on Phoenician mythology and religious beliefs. According to Philo, Sanchuniathon derived the sacred lore from inscriptions on the Ammouneis (i.e., images or pillars of Baal Amon), which stood in Phoenician temples.

Charles Anthon* is said to have written &quot;The history of Phoenicia by Sanconiatho, who was a contemporary with Solomon, would have been entirely lost to us, had it not been for the valuable fragments preserved by Eusebius.&quot;

&quot;Sanchoniathon, a Phoenician author, who if the fragments of his works that have reached us be genuine, and if such a person ever existed, must be regarded as the most ancient writer of whom we have any knowledge after Moses. As to the period when be flourished, all is uncertain. He is the author of three principal works, which were written in Phoenician. They were translated into the Greek language by Herennius Philo, who lived in the second century A.D. It is from this translation which we obtain all the fragments of Sanchoniathon that have reached our times. Philo had divided his translation into nine books, of which Porphyry made use in his diatribe against the Christians. It is from the fourth book of this lost work that Eusebius took, for an end directly opposite to this, the passages which have come down to us. And thus we have those documents relating to the mythology and history of the Phoenicians from the fourth hand.&quot;

Sanchoniathon makes mention of a history which he once wrote upon the worship of the serpent. The title of this work, according to Eusebius, was Ethothion, or Ethothia. Another treatise upon the same subject was written by Pherecydes Tyrus, which was probably a copy of the former; for he is said to have composed it from some previous accounts of the Phœnicians. The title of his book was the Theology of Ophion, styled Ophioneus, and his worshippers were called Ophionidæ. Thoth and Athoth were certainly titles of the Deity in the Gentile world; and the book of Sanchoniathon might very possibly have been from hence named Ethothion, or more truly, Athothion. But, from the subject upon which it was written, as well as from the treatise of Pherecydes, we have reason to think that Athothion, or Ethothion, was a mistake for Ath-Ophion, a title which more immediately related to that worship of which the writer treated. Ath was a sacred title, as we have shewn, and we imagine that this dissertation did not barely relate to the serpentine Deity, but contained accounts of his votaries, the Ophitæ, the principal of which were the sons of Chus.

Philo of Byblos and Porphyry of Tyre

Phoenicia produced a number of important writers in Greek, most notably Philo of Byblos (64-141), and in the 3rd century Porphyry of Tyre. Porphyry played a key role in disseminating the Neoplatonic philosophy of his master Plotinus, which would influenced pagan and Christian thought in the later Roman Empire.

Literary (of mytho-literary) work
The great cycle of narratives about Baal from Ugarit in its present form is clearly a literary work rather than a myth, it is doubtlessly composed of religiously significant mythic material. While there are Greek and Latin sources such as De Dea Syra (&quot;About the Syrian Goddess&quot;) from the 2nd century AD, attributed to Lucian of Samosata, and the section of Eusebius of Caesarea's Praeparatio evangelica (&quot;Preparation for the Gospel&quot;; 4th century AD) that cites extracts from a History of Phoenicia by Philo of Byblos (c. AD 100); Philo himself claimed to be translating the work of an early Phoenician priest, Sanchuniathon (referenced earlier). They are mostly works that deal with religious material and not literary per say. Further, there is not enough material that has survived the centuries of Phoenician history to the present for higher literary criticism. The most outstanding or major literary work is The Baal Cycle which is summarized herewith.

The Baal Cycle
Baal (Hadad) is regularly denominated &quot;the son of Dagan,&quot; although Dagan (biblical Dagon) does not appear as an actor in the mythological texts. Baal also bears the titles &quot;Rider of the Clouds,&quot; &quot;Almighty,&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Earth.&quot; He is the god of the thunderstorm, the most vigorous and aggressive of the gods, the one on whom mortals most immediately depend. Baal resides on Mount Zaphon, north of Ugarit, and is usually depicted holding a thunderbolt. He is the protagonist of a cycle of myths from Ugarit. These tell of a challenge from Yamm (&quot;Sea&quot;), to which Baal responds. Armed with magical weapons made by the craftsman god, Kothar, Baal manages to overcome Yamm. Another major episode is instigated by Baal's lack of a house. With the assistance of Asherah and Anath, Baal gets El's approval to build a house; Kothar accomplishes the construction; and Baal celebrates by inviting the gods to a feast. The other major story concerns Baal's relations with Mot (&quot;Death&quot;), whom he initially defies, but to whom he eventually succumbs. The attempt to find a god adequate to assume Baal's role fails. Anath disposes of Mot, and then El learns in a dream that Baal is again alive. Mot also reappears, and he and Baal fight until the sun goddess warns Mot of the consequences. There is apparently a final definition of their respective spheres of influence.

After Baal is swallowed up by Mot, his sister Anath, called &quot;the Maiden,&quot; longs for him like a mother. She finds Baal and buries him. She then defeats Mot and disposes of his body as if it were grain, grinding him up and scattering him over land and sea. Elsewhere in the text Anath refers to her victories over various monstrous enemies in single combat, and she is depicted in scenes of bloody slaughter. She is the &quot;villain&quot; of the tale of Aqhat, also from Ugarit. In this story the gods grant the childless Danel a son, Aqhat, on whom Danel confers a bow made by the craftsman god, Kothar. Anath offers Aqhat riches and immortality in exchange for the bow, but Aqhat refuses her offers. After bullying El into letting her have her way with Aqhat, she proceeds, with the aid of her henchman Yutpan, to have Aqhat killed. Danel performs various rites to try to remove the consequent blight on the land, until he is informed of his son's murder. He then seeks his remains and buries him, curses the towns closest to the site of the murder, and mourns for seven years, after which he gives his blessing to his daughter's proposed mission to avenge Aqhat's death. She sets out and comes to the camp of Yutpan, where the two of them start drinking--at which point the preserved portion of the tale ends. Anath is often associated with Athtart (later Hebrew Ashtoreth, Greek Astarte). Both are renowned for their beauty, and both are closely associated with Baal.

Another group of gods play important subordinate roles in the myths. The sun goddess, Shapash, &quot;Light of the Gods,&quot; helps Anath in her retrieval of the dead Baal and intervenes in the final conflict between Baal and Mot. The craftsman god, known as both Kothar (&quot;Skilled&quot;) and Hasis (&quot;Clever&quot;), makes the weapons with which Baal disposes of Yamm and builds the palace for Baal. He is the source of Aqhat's bow, coveted by Anath. The Kathirat are goddesses of marriage and pregnancy, who appear before the conception of Aqhat and in a brief myth about the marriage of Yarikh (&quot;Moon&quot;) and his Mesopotamian consort Nikkal. Shahar and Shalim are the gods of dawn and dusk, whose conception and birth are recounted in a liturgical myth.

While the great cycle of narratives about Baal from Ugarit in its present form is clearly a literary work rather than a myth, it is doubtlessly composed of religiously significant mythic material. It depicts the prevailing order of things as the result of struggles among the gods--successive bids for power in which Yamm and Mot are confined to their present bounds and Baal and Anath (associated with fertility and military prowess, respectively) prevail. Having descended into the underworld and survived Death, Baal embodies the assertiveness and continuity of life.

It is the official documents of religious practice--god lists, sacrificial lists, and temple rituals, as well as the inscribed monuments--that disclose most directly the gods favored by the authorities of the time. While virtually all the gods of the myths are Semitic in name, the gods of the cult are much more diverse.

Baal Cycle Text

Now Mighty Baal, son of Dagon, desired the kingship of the Gods. He contended with Prince Yam-Nahar, the Son of El. But Kindly El, Father Shunem, decided the case in favour of His son; He gave the kingship to Prince Yam. He gave the power to Judge Nahar.

Fearsome Yam came to rule the Gods with an iron fist. He caused Them to labor and toil under His reign. They cried unto Their mother, Asherah, Lady of the Sea. They convinced Her to confront Yam, to interceed in Their behalf.

Asherah went into the presence of Prince Yam. She came before Judge Nahar. She begged that He release His grip upon the Gods Her sons. But Mighty Yam declined Her request. She offered favours to the Tyrant. But Powerful Nahar softened not His heart. Finally, Kindly Asherah, who loves Her children, offered Herself to the God of the Sea. She offered Her own body to the Lord of Rivers.

Yam-Nahar agreed to this, and Asherah returned to the Source of the Two Rivers. She went home to the court of El. She came before the Divine Council, and spoke of Her plan to the Gods Her children.

Baal was infuriated by Her speech. He was angered at the Gods who would allow such a plot. He would not consent to surrendering Great Asherah to the Tyrant Yam-Nahar. He swore to the Gods that He would destroy Prince Yam. He would lay to rest the tyranny of Judge Nahar.

Yam-Nahar was made aware of the words of Baal. He sent His two messengers to the court of El:

&quot;Depart Lads!
Do not sit!
Then Ye shall surely set face
Toward the Convocation of the Assembly 
In the midst of the mountain of Night.
At the feet of El do not fall,
Do not prostrate Yourselves before the Convocation of the Assembly,
But declare Your information!
And say to The Bull, My father, El,
Declare to the Convocation of the Assembly:
'The message of Yam, Your Lord,
Of Your master Judge River:
Give up, O Gods, Him whom You harbor,
Him whom the multitude harbor!
Give up Baal and His partisans,
Dagon's Son, so that I may inherit His gold!'&quot;

The lads depart
They do not Sit.
Then They set face
Toward the Mountain of Night,
Toward the Convocation of the Assembly.
The Gods had not even sat down,
The Deities to dine,
When Baal stood up by El.

As soon as the Gods saw Them,
Saw the messengers of Yam
The emissaries of Judge Nahar,
The Gods lowered Their heads upon Their knees.
Yea, upon the thrones of Their lordships.

Baal rebukes Them:
&quot;Why, O Gods, have Ye lowered 
Your heads on top of Your knees,
Yea, upon the thrones of Your lordships?
Let a pair of Gods read the tablets of the messengers of Yam,
Of the emissaries of Judge Nahar!
O Gods, lift up Your heads
From the top of Your knees
Yea, from the thrones of Your lordships!
And I shall answer
The messengers of Yam
The emissaries of Judge Nahar!&quot;
The Gods lift Their heads
From the top of Their knees
Yea, from the thrones of thier lordships.

After there arrive the messengers of Yam,
The emissaries of JudgeNahar.
At the feet of El They do not fall,
They do not prostrate Themselves before the Convocation of the Assembly.
Arise, for They declare Their information.
A fire, two fires!
He sees a burnished sword!
They say to The Bull, His father, El:
&quot;The message of Yam, Your lord,
Of Your master, Judge Nahar:
'Give up, O Gods, Him whom Ye harbor,
Him whom the multitudes harbor!
Give up Baal and His partisans,
Dagon's Son, so that I may inherit His gold!'&quot;

And The Bull, His father, El, replies:
&quot;Baal is Thy slave, O Yam!
Baal is Thy slave O Yam!
Dagon's Son is Thy captive!
He will bring Thy tribute like the Gods.
Like the Deities, Thy gift!&quot;

But Prince Baal was infuriated.
A knife He takes in the hand
A dagger in the right hand.
To smite the lads He flourishes it.
Anath siezes His right hand,
Astarte seizes His left hand:
&quot;How canst Thou smite the messengers of Yam?
The emissaries of Judge Nahar?
They have merely brought the words of Yam-Nahar.
Word of Their Lord and Master.&quot;

But Prince Baal is infuriated. He spares the lives of the messengers; He sends Them back to Their master. He instructs Them to give His information: Baal will not bow to Prince Yam. He will not be the slave of Judge Nahar. He declares once more that He shall slay the Tyrant lord of the Gods.

&quot;To the earth let Our mighty one fall!
Yea, to dust Our strong one!&quot;
From His mouth the word had not yet gone forth,
Nor from His lips, His utterance.
And His voice was given forth
Like a mountain under the throne of Prince Yam.

And Kothar-u-Khasis declared:
&quot;Did I not tell Thee, O Prince Baal,
Nor declare, O Rider of Clouds?
'Lo, Thine enemies, O Baal,
Lo, Thine enemies wilt Thou smite
Lo, Thou wilt van quish Thy foes.
Thou wilt take Thine eternal kingdom;
Thine everlasting sovereignty!'&quot;

Kothar brings down two clubs
And proclaims Their Names.
&quot;Thy Name, even Thine, is Yagrush!
Yagrush, expel Yam
Expel Yam from His throne
Nahar from the seat of His sovereignty!
Thou shalt swoop from the hands of Baal
Like an Eagle from His fingers!
Strike the shoulders of Prince Yam
Twixt the hands of Judge Nahar!&quot;

The club swoops from the hands of Baal
Like an eagle from His fingers.
It strikes the shoulders of Prince Yam,
Twixt the hands of Judge Nahar.
Yam is strong;
He is not vanquished,
His joints do not fail,
Nor His frame collapse.

Kothar brings down a second club,
And proclaims His Name.
&quot;Thy Name, even Thine, is Aymur!
Aymur, drive Yam,
Drive Yam from His throne!
Nahar from His seat of His sovereignty!
Thou shalt swoop from the hands of Baal
Like an Eagle from His fingers!
Strike the head of Prince Yam
Twixt the eyes of Judge Nahar!
Let Yam sink
And fall to the earth!&quot;

And the club swoops from the hands of Baal
Like an eagle from His fingers.
It strikes the head of Prince Yam,
Twixt the eyes of Judge Nahar.

Yam sinks,
Falls to the earth.
His joints fail
His frame collapses.
Baal drags and poises Yam
Destroys Judge Nahar.

By Name, Astarte rebukes:
&quot;Shmae, O Aliyan Baal,
Shame, O Rider of the Clouds!
For Prince Yam was Our captive
For Judge River was Our captive.&quot;

And there went out Baal,
Verily ashamed is Aliyan Baal
And Prince Yam is, indeed, dead.
So let Baal reign!

Baal was now King of the Gods. Lord of the Mountain of Saphon. But Baal had no palace like the other Gods. He speaks His word to Kothat-u-Khasis:

&quot;There are the dwelling of El,
The shelter of His sons.
The dwelling of Lady Asherah of the Sea,
The dwelling of the renowned brides.
The dwelling of Pidray, girl of Light,
The shelter of Tallay, girl of rain,
The dwelling of Arsay, girl of Yaabdar.

Also, something else I'll tell Thee.
Go to!
Beseech Lady Asherah of the Sea,
Entreat the Creatress of Gods!&quot;

The Skilled One goes up to the bellows.
In the hands of Khasis are the tongs.
He pours silver,
He casts gold.
He pours silver by thousands of shekels,
Gold He pours by myriads.
A glorious crown studded with silver,
Adorned with red gold.
A glorious throne,
A dais above a glorious footstool,
Which glisters in purity.
Glorious shoes of reception,
Thereover He brings them gold.
A glorious table that is full.
A glorious bowl, fine work of Kamares,
Set like the realm of Yam,
In which there are buffaloes by myriads.

Kothar-u-Kasis goes to the Lady Asherah of the Sea, Mother of the Seventy Gods. He offers these gifts unto Her.

He adorns Her with the covering of Her flesh.
She tears Her clothing.
On the second day
He adorns Her in the two rivers.
She sets a pot on the fire
A vessel on top of the coals.

She propitiates The Bull, God of Mercy,
Entreats the Creator of Creatures.
On lifting Her eyes
She sees.
Asherah sees Baal's going,
Yea the going of the Virgin Anath,
The tread of the Progenitress of Heroes.

After Aliyan Baal came,
And came the Virgin Anath,
They besought Lady Asherah of the Sea.
Yea entreated the Creatress of the Gods.
And Lady Asherah of the Sea replied:
&quot;How can Ye beseech Lady Asherah of the Sea,
Yea entreat the Creatress of the Gods?
Have Ye besought The Bull, God of Mercy,
Or entreated the Creator of Creatures?

And the Virgin Anath replied:
&quot;We do beseech Lady Asherah of the Sea.
We entreat the Creatress of Gods.
The Gods eat and drink,
And those that suck the breast quaff
With a keen knife
A slice of fatling.
They drink wine from a goblet,
From a cup of gold, the blood of vines.&quot;

Asherah of the Sea declares:
&quot;Saddle an ass,
Hitch a donkey!
Put on a harness of silver,
Trappings of gold.
Prepare the harness of My jennies!

Qadish-u-Amrar hearkens.
He saddles an ass
Hitches a donkey.
Put on a harness of silver,
Trappings of gold.
Prepares the harness of Her jennies!
Qadish-u-Amrar embraces;
He sets Asherah on the back of the ass,
On the beautiful back of the donkey.
Qadish begins to light the way,
Even Amrar like a star.
Forward goes the Virgin Anath,
And Baal departs for the heights of Saphon.

Then She sets face toward El,
At the sources of the Two Rivers,
In the midst of the streams of the Two Deeps.
She enters the abode of El,
And comes into the domicile of the King, Father Shunem.
At the feet of El She bows and falls,
She prostrates Herself and honors Him.

As soon as El sees Her,
He cracks a smile and laughs.
His feet He sets on the footstool,
And twiddles His fingers.
He lifts His voice
And shouts:
&quot;Why has Lady Asherah of the Sea come?
Why came the Creatress of Gods?
Art Thou hungry?
Then have a morsel!
Or art Thou thirsty?
Then have a drink!
Eat!
Or drink!
Eat bread from the tables!
Drink wine from the goblets!
From a cup of gold, the blood of vines!
If the love of El moves Thee,
Yea the affection of The Bull arouses Thee!&quot;

And Lady Asherah of the Sea replies:
&quot;Thy word, El, is wise;
Thou art wise unto eternity;
Lucky life is Thy word.
Our king is Aliyan Baal,
Out judge, and none is above Him.
Let both of Us drain His chalice;
Both of Us drain His cup!&quot;

Loudly Bull-El, Her father, shouts,
King El who brought Her into being;
There shout Asherah and Her sons,
The Goddess and the band of Her brood:
&quot;Lo there is no house unto Baal like the Gods.
Not a court like the sons of Asherah:
The dwelling of El,
The shelter of His sons.
The dwelling of Lady Asherah of the Sea,
The dwelling of the renowned brides.
The dwelling of Pidray, girl of Light.
The shelter of Tallay, girl of rain.
The dwelling of Arsay, girl of Yaabdar.&quot;

And the God of Mercy replied:
&quot;Am I to act as a lackey of Asherah?
Am I to act like the holder of a trowel?
If the handmaid of Asherah will make the bricks
A house shall be built for Baal like the Gods.
Yea a court like the sons of Asherah.&quot;

And Lady Asherah of the Sea replied:
&quot;Thou art great, O El,
Thou are verily wise!
The gray of Thy beard hath verily instructed Thee!
Here are pectorals of gold for Thy breast.

Lo, also it is the time of His rain.
Baal sets the season,
And gives forth His voice from the clouds.
He flashes lightning to the earth.
As a house of cedars let Him complete it,
Or a house of bricks let Him erect it!
Let it be told to Aliyan Baal:
'The mountains will bring Thee much silver.
The hills, the choicest of gold;
The mines will bring Thee precious stones,
And build a house of silver and gold.
A house of lapis gems!'&quot;

The Virgin Anath rejoices.
She jumps with the feet
And leaves the earth.
Then She sets face toward the Lord of Saphon's crest
By the thousand acres,
Yea the myriad hectares.
The Virgin Anath laughs.
She lifts Her voice
And shouts:
&quot;Be informed, Baal!
Thy news I bring!
A house shall be built for Thee as for Thy brothers,
Even as a court as for Thy kin!
The mountains will bring Thee much silver.
The hills, the choicest of gold;
The mines will bring Thee precious stones,
And build a house of silver and gold.
A house of lapis gems!&quot;

Aliyan Baal rejoices.
The mountains bring Him much silver,
The mines bring Him precious stones.

Kothar-u-Khasis is sent.
After Kothar-u-Khasis arrived,
He sets an ox in front of Him.
A fatling directly before Him.
A chair is placed,
And He is seated
At the right of Aliyan Baal,
Until They have eaten
And drunk.

And Aliyan Baal declares:
&quot;Hurry, let a house be built.
Hurry, let a palace be erected!
Hurry, let a house be built.
Hurry, let a palace be erected
In the midst of the heights of Saphon!
A thousand acres the house is to comprise,
A myriad hectares, the palace!&quot;

And Kothar-u-Khasis declares:
&quot;Hear, O Aliyan Baal!
Percieve, O Rider of Clouds!
I shall surely put a window in the house,
A casement in the midst of the palace!&quot;

And Aliyan Baal replies:
&quot;Do not put a window in the house,
A casement in the midst of the palace!
Let not Pidray, girl of Light,
Nor Tallay, girl of rain,
Be seen by El's beloved Yam Nahar!&quot;
The Lord reviles and spits.

And Kothar-u-Khasis replies:
&quot;Thou wilt return, Baal, to My word.&quot;

Of ceders His house is to be built,
Of bricks is His palace to be erected.
He goes to Lebabob and it's trees,
To Syria and the choicest of it's cedars.
Lo, Lebanon and it's trees,
Syria and it's cedars.
Fire is set on the house,
Flame on the palace.
Behold a day and a second,
The fire eats into the house,
The flame into the palace.
A fifth, a sixth day,
The fire eats into the house,
The flame in the midst of the palace.
Behold, on the seventh day,
The fire departs from the house,
The flame from the palace.
Silver turns from blocks,
Gold is turned from bricks.

Aliyan Baal rejoices.
&quot;My house have I built of silver.
My palace of gold have I made.&quot;

His house, Baal prepairs.
Hadad prepares the housewarming of His palace.
He slaughters great and small cattle
He fells oxen and ram-fatlings.
Yearling calves,
Little lambs and kids.
He called His brothers into His house.
His kinsmen into the midst of His palace.
He called the Seventy sons of Asherah.
He caused the shep Gods to drink wine.
He caused the ewe Goddesses to drink wine.
He cause the bull Gods to drink wine.
He caused the cow Goddesses to drink wine.
He caused the throne Gods to drink wine.
He caused the chair Goddesses to drink wine.
He caused the jar Gods to drink wine.
He caused the jug Goddesses to drink wine.
Until the Gods had eaten and drunk,
And the sucklings quaffed
With a keen knife
A slice of fatling.
They drink wine from a goblet,
From a cup of gold, the blood of vines.

Lord Baal went on to take possesion of many earthly cities. Sixty-six, Seventy-Seven towns He took. Eighty, Ninety was the total number of cities that fell to the posession of Mighty Hadad. Thus Baal returned to His home as Lord of all the World.

As Baal went into the midst of the house
Aliyan Baal declared:
&quot;I would install, Kothar, son of the Sea,
Yea Kothar, son of the assembly!
Let a casement be opened in the house;
A window in the midst of the palace,
And let the clouds be opened with rain
On the opening of Kothar-u-Khasis.&quot;

Kothar-u-Khasis laughed.
He lifts His voice
And shouts:
&quot;Did I not tell Thee, O Aliyan Baal,
That Thou wouldst return, Baal, to My word?
Let a casement be opened in the house,
A window in the midst of the palace!&quot;

Baal opened the clouds with rain,
His holy voice He gives forth in the heavens.

The enemies of Baal seize the forests,
The foes of Hadad, the fringes of the mountain.
And Aliyan Baal declares:
&quot;Enemies of Hadad, why do Ye invade?
Why do Ye invade the arsenal of Our defense?&quot;
Weeping, Baal returns to His house:
&quot;Whether king
Or commander
Be invested with sovereignty over the land,
Respects I shall not send to Mavet,
Nor greetings to El's beloved, the Hero!&quot;

Mavet calls from His throat,
The Beloved meditates in His inwards:
&quot;I alone am He who will rule over the Gods.
Yea command Gods and men.
Even dominate the multitudes of the earth.&quot;

Aloud Baal cries to His lads:
&quot;Look, Gupan and Ugar, sons of Galmat,
Errand lads, sons of Zalmat
The lofty and distinguished!
Then surely set face
Toward the mountain of Tergezz,
Toward the mountain of Shermeg,
Toward the furrow of the thriving of the earth.
Lift the mountain on the hands,
The hill on top of the palms,
And go down into to nether-reaches of the earth
So that You will be counted amoung those who go down into the earth!
Then shall Ye set face
Toward His city, Hemry.
Lo, the throne on which He sits
In the midst of the land of His inheritance
And the guards of the defense of the Gods.
Do not draw near the God Mavet,
Lest He make You like a lamb in His mouth,
Like a kid in His jaws Ye be crushed!
The Torch of the Gods, Shapash, burns;
The heavens halt on account of El's darling, Mavet.
By the thousand acres,
Yea the myriad hectares
At the feet of Mavet bow and fall.
Prostrate Yourselves and honor Him!
And say to the God Mavet,
Declare to El's beloved, the Hero:

And Baal spoke His word to His lads. He sent His message to Mavet. The Lord Hadad refused to pay tribute to the Beloved of El. Mavet was enfuriated, and sent His word back to Baal. He declared that, because Baal had destroyed the Serpent Lotan, He would exact revenge by devouring Baal. The messengers of Baal informed Baal that Mavet would open His mouth wide.

&quot;A lip to earth,
A lip to heaven,
And a tounge to the stars
So that Baal may enter His inwards,
Yea, descend into His mouth
As scorched is the olive,
The produce of the Earth,
And the fruit of the Trees.&quot;

Aliyan Baal fears Him,
The Rider of the Clouds dreads Him.
&quot;Depart! Speak to the God Mavet.
Declare to El's Beloved, the Hero:
The message of Aliyan Baal,
The word of Aliy the Warrior:
'Hail, O God Mavet!
Thy slave am I,
Yea Thine forever.'&quot;

The Gods depart and do not sit.
Then They set face toward the God Mavet.
Toward His city, Hemry.
Behold it is the throne of His sitting,
Yea the land of His inheritance!
They lift Their voices
And shout:
&quot;The message of Aliyan Baal
The word of Aliy the Warrior!
&quot;Hail, O God Mavet!
Thy slave am I,
Yea Thine forever!&quot;

The God Mavet is glad. Baal will be delivered unto Him, and the fertility of the land will die with Him. Baal feasts His last meal, and Mavet commands Him:

&quot;I shall put Him in the grave of the Gods of the earth.
And Thou, take Thy clouds,
Thy wind, Thy storm, Thy rains!
With Thee Thy seven lads,
Thine eight swine.
With Thee, Pidray, girl of Light,
With Thee, Tallay, girl of rain.
Then Thy face shalt Thou set toward the mountain of Kenkeny.
Lift the mountain on the hands,
The hill on top of the palms,
And go down to the nether reaches of the earth
So that Thou mayest be counted amoung those who do down into the earth,
And all may know that Thou art dead!&quot;

Aliyan Baal hearkens.
He loves a heifer in Deber,
A young cow in the fields of Shechelmemet.
He lies with Her seventy-seven times,
Yea, eighty-eight times,
So that She conceives
And bears Moshe.

Baal was found dead there in the fields of Shechelmemet, in the land of Deber. The news reaches the ears of El, Father of Shunem:

Thereupon the God of Mercy
Goes down from the throne,
Sits on the footstool,
And from the footstool sits on the earth.
He pours the ashes of grief on His head,
The dust of wallowing on His pate.
For clothing, He is covered with a doubled cloak.
He roams the mountain in mourning,
Yea through the forest in grief.
He cuts cheek and chin,
He lacerates His forearms.
He plows His chest like a garden;
Like a vale He lacerates His back.
He lifts His voice
And shouts:
&quot;Baal is dead!
Woe to the people of Dagon's son!
Woe to the multitudes of Athar-Baal!
I shall go down into the earth.&quot;

Also Anath goes
And treads every mountain to the midst of the Earth.
Every hill to the midst of the fields.
She comes to the goodness of the land of Deber,
The beauty of the fields of Shechelmemet.
She comes upon Baal prostrate on the earth.

For clothing She is covered with a doubled cloak.
The mountain in mournig She roams.
In grief, through the forest.
She cuts cheek and chin.
She lacerates Her forearms.
She plows lake a garden Her chest,
Like a vale She lacerates the back.
&quot;Baal is dead!
Woe to the people of Dagon's son!
Woe to the multitudes of Athar-Baal!
Let us go down into the earth.&quot;

With Her goes down the Torch of the Gods, Shapash.
Until She is sated with weeping,
She drinks tears like wine.
Aloud She cries to the Torch of the Gods, Shapash:
&quot;Load Aliyan Baal on to Me!&quot;

The Torch of the Gods, Shapash, hearkens.
She lifts Aliyan Baal,
On the shoulders of Anath She places Him,
She raises Him into the heights of Saphon.
She weeps for Him and buries Him.
She puts Him in the grave of the Gods of the earth.

She sacrifices seventy buffaloes
As an offering for Aliyan Baal.
She sacrifices seventy oxen
As an offering for Aliyan Baal.
She sacrifices seventy head of small cattle
As an offering for Aliyan Baal.
She sacrifices seventy deer
As an offering for Aliyan Baal.
She sacrifices seventy wild goats
As an offering for Aliyan Baal.
She sacrifices seventy asses
As an offering for Aliyan Baal.

Then She sets face toward El
At the sources of the Two Rivers,
In the midst of the streams of the Two Deeps.
She enters the abode of El,
Goes into the domicile of the King, Father Shunem.
At the feet of El She bends and falls,
Prostrates Herself and honors Him.
She lifts Her voice
And shouts:
&quot;Let Asherah and Her sons rejoice,
The Goddess and the band of Her brood!
For dead is Aliyan Baal,
For Perished is the Prince, Lord of Earth!&quot;

Aloud cries El to Asherah of the Sea:
&quot;Hear, O Lady Asherah of the Sea!
Give one of Thy sons that I may make Him king!&quot;

And Lady Asherah of the Sea replies:
&quot;Let Us make king one who knows how to govern!&quot;

And the God of Mercy declares:
&quot;One feeble of frame will not vie with Baal,
Nor wield a spear against Dagon's son.&quot;

When the parley is finished,
Lady Asherah of the Sea declares:
&quot;Let Us make Ashtar the Terrible king!
Let Ashtar the Terrible reign!&quot;

Thereupon Ashtar the Terrible
Goes into the heights of Saphon
That He may sit on the throne of Aliyan Baal.
His feet do not reach the footstool,
Nor does His head reach it's top.
And Ashtar the Terrible says:
&quot;I cannot rule in the heights of Saphon!&quot;
Ashtar the Terrible goes down,
Goes down from the throne of Aliyan Baal,
That He may rule over all the grand earth.

Anath goes now to face Mavet, the Darling of El, the Hero.

As with the heart of a cow toward her calf,
As with the heart of an ete toward her lamb,
So is the heart of Anath toward Baal.
She seizes Mavet, in ripping His garment.
She closes in on Him, in tearing His clothes.
She lifts Her voice
And shouts:
&quot;Come, Mavet, yield My brother!&quot;

And the God Mavet replies:
&quot;What does Thou ask, O Virgin Anath?
I was going,
And roaming
Every mountain to the midst of the earth,
Every hill to the midst of the fields.
A soul was missing amoung men,
A soul of the multitudes of the earth.
I arrived at the goodness of the land of Debar,
The beauty of the fields of Shechelmemet.
I met Aliyan Baal;
I made Him like a lamb in My mouth.
Like a kid in My jaws was He crushed.&quot;

The Torch of the Gods, Shapash, glows,
The heavens stop on account of the God Mavet.
A day, two days pass.
From days to months.

The maiden Anath meets Him.
As with the heart of a cow toward her calf,
As with the heart of an ete toward her lamb,
So is the heart of Anath toward Baal.
She siezes the God Mavet.
With a sword She cleaves Him,
With a pitchfork She winnows Him,
With a fire She burns Him,
In the millstones She grinds Him,
In the fields She plants Him,
So that the birds do not eat His flesh,
Nor the fowl destroy His portion.
Flesh calls to flesh.

The Great El, Father Shunem, declares of the lost God Baal:

&quot;For perished is the Prince, Lord of Earth.
And if Aliyan Baal is alive,
And if the Prince, Lord of Earth, exists,
In a dream of the God of Mercy,
In a vision of the Creator of Creatures,
Let the heavens rain oil,
The wadies run with honey,
That I may know that Aliyan Baal is alive,
That the Prince, Lord of Earth, exists.&quot;

In a dream of the God of Mercy,
In a vision of the Creator of Creatures,
The heavens rain oil,
The wadies run with honey,
The God of Mercy rejoices.
His feet He sets on the footstool.
He cracks a smile and laughs.
He lifts His voice
And shouts:
&quot;Let Me sit and rest,
And let My soul repose in My breast.
For Aliyan Baal is alive,
For the Prince, Lord of Earth, exists.&quot;
Aloud shouts El to the Virgin Anath:
&quot;Hear, O Virgin Anath,
Say to the Torch of the Gods, Shapash:
'Over the furrows of the fields, O Shapash,
Over the furrows of the fields let El set Thee.
As for the Lord of the Plowed Furrows,
Where is Aliyan Baal?
Where is the Prince, Lord of Earth?'&quot;

The Virgin Anath departs.
Then She sets face toward the Torch of the Gods, Shapash.
She lifts Her voice
And shouts:
&quot;The message of Bull-El, Thy father,
The word of the God of Mercy, Thy begetter:
'Over the furrows of the fields, O Shapash,
Over the furrows of the fields let El set Thee!
As for the Lord of the Furrows of His plowing,
Where is Aliyan Baal?
Where is the Prince, Lord of Earth?'&quot;

And the Torch of the Gods, Shapash, replies:
&quot;I shall seek Aliyan Baal!&quot;

And the Virgin Anath answers:
&quot;As for Me, tis not I, O Shapash!
As for Me, tis not I, but El summons Thee!
May the Gods guard Thee in Sheol!&quot;

Shapash descends into the underworld. She enters the relm of Sheol. Upon Her return to the world above, She carries Great Baal with Her. Ball goes into the heights of Saphon. He confronts Mavet, the Hero.

Baal seizes the son of Asherah.
The great one He smites on the shoulder.
The tyrant He smites with a stick.
Mavet is vanquished,
Reaches earth.

Baal returns to the throne of His kingship,
Dagon's son to the seat of His sovereignty.
From days to months,
From months to years,
Lo in the seventh year.

And the God Mavet addresses Himself to Aliyan Baal.
He lifts His voice
And shouts:
&quot;Because of Thee, O Baal, I have experienced humiliation.
Because of Thee, experienced scattering by the sword.
Because of Thee, experienced burning in the fire.
Because of Thee, experienced grinding in the millstones.
Because of Thee, experienced winnowing by the pitchfork.
Because of Thee, experienced being planted in the feilds.
Because of Thee, experienced being sown in the sea.&quot;

Thereupon Mavet threatens to destroy Baal in revenge. He threatens to take the kingship of Baal. Baal expels Him, drives Him out of the heights of Saphon. Mavet vows His revenge eupon Baal:

&quot;And lo, as a brother of Yam Thou art made, Baal is given
As retribution for the destroyed sons of My mother!&quot;

He returns to the Lord of the heights of Saphon,
He lifts His voice
And shouts:
&quot;A brother of Yam Thou art made, O Baal!
As retribution for the destroyed sons of My mother!&quot;

They shake each other like Gemar-beasts,
Mavet is strong, Baal is strong.
They gore each other like buffaloes,
Mavet is strong, Baal is strong.
They bite like serpents,
Mavet is strong, Baal is strong.
They kick like racing beasts,
Mavet is down, Ball is down.

Up comes Shapash.
She cries to Mavet:
&quot;Hear, O God Mavet!
How canst Thou fight with Aliyan Baal?
How will Bull-El, Thy father, not hear Thee?
Will He not remove the supports of Thy throne?
Nor upset the seat of Thy kingship?
Nor break the scepter of Thy rule?&quot;

The Got Mavet is afraid,
El's Beloved, the Hero, is frightened.
Mavet is roused from His prstration.

The God of Sterility submits to Baal. He conceeds the kingship to the Lord of Earth. Baal returns to the Heights of Saphon, but Anath does not go with Him. She turns Her anger to the enemies of Baal. To those who were fickle against Baal in His trials. The attacks mankind.

Like the fruit of seven daughters,
The scent of kids and anhb-animals,
Both gates of Anath's house.

And the lads chance upon the Lady of the Mountain.
And lo, Anath smites in the valley,
Fighting between the two cities.
She smites the people of the seashore,
Destroys mankind of the sunrise.
Under Her are heads like vultures.
Over Her are hands like locusts,
Like thorns, the hands of troops.
She piles up heads on Her back,
She ties up hands in Her bundle.
Knee-deep She plunges in the blood of soldiery,
Up to the neck in the gore of troops.
With a stick She drives out foes,
Against the flank She draws Her bow.

And lo, Anath reaches Her house,
Yea the Goddess enters Her palace,
But is not satisfied.
She had smitten in the valley,
Fought between the two cities.

She hurls chairs at the troops,
Hurling tables at the soldiers,
Footstools at the heroes.
Much She smites and looks,
Fights and views.
Anath gluts Her liver with laughter.
Her heart is filled with joy,
For Anath's hand is victory.
For knee-deep She plunges in the blood of soldiery,
Up to the neck in the gore of troops.

Until She is sated She smites in the house,
Fights between the two tables,
Shedding the blood of soldiery.

Pouring the oil of peace from a bowl,
The Virgin Anath washes Her hands,
The Progenitress of Heroes, Her fingers.
She washes Her hands in the blood of soldiery,
Her fingers in the gore of troops.

Arranging portions by the chairs,
Tables by the tables,
Footstools She arranges by the footstools.
She gathers water and washes
With dew of heaven,
Fat of earth,
Rain of the Rider of Clouds,
The dew that the heavens pour,
The rain that the stars pour.
The anhb-animals leap by the thousand acres,
The zuh-fish in the sea, by the myriads of hectares.

Literature of the Colonies (Punic Literature)
by Maurice Sznycer, Chargé de Recherches at the National Centre for Scientific Research (France)
&quot;... there was a great deal of virtue and wisdom in the Punic books&quot; St. Augustine

In a recent book on Carthage the English historian Warmington did not hesitate to affirm that there is no Punic literature. Indeed, at first sight, to talk of literature in connection with the few surviving Punic writings might seem like, tempting Providence. First of all we must establish our definition of the word &quot;literature&quot;. The Oxford Dictionary gives a vague definition: &quot;the writings of a country or period or of the world in general&quot;, but this was controverted long ago by Voltaire in his Dictionnaire Philosophique (&quot;literature: this is one of those meaningless terms which are so common in all languages&quot;). It is plain that the concept is still in the process of evolving, as it has done throughout the course of every culture, period, taste and fashion. For a long time, an aura of immense prestige surrounded the word, but this was already beginning to dissipate with the famous saying of Verlaine: &quot;all the rest is literature and now it often signifies everything artificial and hollow in an overall pejorative sense.

Today above all the definition of literature is always under review, but nevertheless the criterion most frequently applied to a literary work is the information it conveys. Looking at the question from this point of view, if we accept, for example, the definition of American poet Ezra Pound: Literature is news that stays news&quot;, it can be stated without reservation that there is a considerable body of Punic literature. Indeed, several thousand inscriptions are known which, in spite of their comparative uniformity and aridity of style, constituted a priceless source of information, and their value as so much direct evidence is replaceable. These, it must be emphasized are no more than the vestigial re remains of all the literature which the Punic civilisation created during the thousand years of its blossoming.

The Extent of Punic Literature
Over and above the thousands of inscriptions from Carthage itself and the areas in contact with Punic culture which are the only known records actually written in the Punic language, we have a certain number of Punic texts transcribed into Greek or Latin script. The most important of these are the passages inserted in the Poenulus of Plautus and several versions of Punic texts translated into Greek and Latin, particularly the Periplus of Hanno, the Oath of Hannibal and a few fragments of Mago's treatise on agriculture.

The rest of Punic literature -- that is to say nearly all of it -- is lost, but I cannot accept that it is beyond recovery. The example of Ras Shamra Ugarit reminds us, that the miracle of a great discovery is never impossible. Who indeed would have dared to believe before 1929 (the date of the discovery) that the soil of Phoenicia, where, as regards Phoenician documents, only inscriptions had hitherto been found, less numerous indeed than those of Carthage, would suddenly reveal a whole library containing among other things great poems worthy of comparison with the Biblical texts or even with Homer?

When one is conscious of the value of the Cartahaginian civilisation and its flowering (in Numidia, Libya, Spain, Sicily and Sardinia, etc.), it is impossible to doubt the existence of a rich literature. This claim rests not only on deduction and comparison with other oriental Semitic civilisations, but also pre-eminently on a body of precise evidence. First of all, the little of it which survives -- comprising on the one hand the bulk of the somewhat repetitive Punic inscriptions and on the other the fragments of Greek Latin translations -- and still attests the existence of several different branches of Punic literature on subjects such as religion, history, law, politics and travels, etc. Moreover, the clues, which can be gleaned from the various ancient authorities, leave no doubt as to the extent and importance of this literature.

It is definitely known that Carthage established vast libraries. Most of these must have been lost during the destruction of the city by the Romans in 146 B.C. Not all, however, since the Elder Pliny tells us that &quot;after the capture of Carthage the Senate presented the libraries of the town to the region's princes&quot; (1). One always wonders, as does Stephen Gsell for example, whether these libraries had been established only at the time of the Punic wars, on the model of that of Alexandria, or whether, much earlier, the Carthaginians had copied the example of the Assyrian King Assurbanipal in the seventh century B.C. The relevant point is, however, that the formation of a library postulates the existence of a vast body of Punic literature which had been accumulating for centuries, some of it going back as far as the foundation of Carthage. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that the Tyrian colonists setting out to found Phoenician establishments on the distant shores of Western Mediterranean under the patronage of the gods of the mother city would not have brought with them their sacred books, their mythological tales and their epic poetry. We can form of which an idea from the Ugaritic texts from Ras Shamra, their rituals and laws. It moreover, equally unlikely that they would not rapidly elaborate on their own epics, narrating the fabulous feature of Queen Dido-Elissa, the legend, founder of Carthage. In the first place several ancient authors refer to Punic chronicles setting down the history the city's foundation. These facts, in conjunction with everything we can discover about Punic religion, thanks in large part to the inscriptions, confirm that there actually existed in Carthage a body of religious literature probably very extensive. They were forming, in other Phoenician cities, the most important part of all Punic literature. Moreover, in a work of Plutarch there is a reference to sacred writing kept in the temples and accessible only to priests and initiates, which were secretly buried at the time of the sack of Carthage. Although he was referring to an action attributed to an imaginary person, unlike Gsell, I do not believe that his evidence should be completely rejected. It is certainly an echo, even if somewhat distorted of an historical fact.

Alongside the rich and extensive religious literature we know that true historical literature existed at Carthage. The existence of Punic chronicles is mentioned not only by Pseudo-Aristotle (3) and the Greek historian Timacus of Tauromenion (third century B.C.), but also, in the fourth century A.D., by Servius Honoratus, the Latin scholiast on Vergil, speaking of &quot;historia Poenorum&quot; and of &quot;Punica historia&quot; (4). All this leads us to the conclusion that there were actual historiographers at Carthage whose task it was to record in writing the most notable events in the life and history of the city. Further, over the course of the centuries, they must have elaborated a whole series of chronicles and historical writings, probably in the form of annals. We know, moreover, that the Carthaginians were in the habit of recording their outstanding deeds in long commemorative inscriptions, usually placed in the temples. Livy tells us, too, that during the Punic War &quot;Hannibal spent the summer near the Temple of Juno Lacinia. He had an altar erected with a long carved inscription detailling his exploits in Punic and Greek characters&quot; (5). This inscription in the Temple of Hera Lacinia at Croton was painstakingly studied by Polybius (6). It contained in particular an account of the troops exchanged between Spain and Africa and of those left in Spain by Hasdrubal at the start of the war in 219 B.C. Another example of this custom is the Periplus of Hanno, which we shall discuss later. On his return from his expedition on the ocean, Hanno had his records carved &quot;on plaques hung up in the Temple of Chronos&quot;.

The existence of historical and commemorative inscriptions is attested not only in territories under the direct control of Carthage; it was equally common in the whole Punic sphere of influence, particularly Numidia. In one of his speeches for the prosecution, Cicero describes a misfortune, which befell King Massinissa of Numidia in Malta. &quot;Tradition has it that a fleet of Massinissa landed at this spot, that the King's prefect took from the temple some ivory tusks of unbelievable size, and carried them off to give to the king. At first the king was delighted with the gift, but later, when he found out where they came from, he sent trustworthy men in a quinquireme to put them back in the temple. That is why it is recorded there in Punic lettering that Massinissa accepted them in ignorance of their provenance&quot; (7). This story is confirmed by a comment of Valerius Maximus in the first century A.D. in his Memorable Deeds and Sayings. It is known, moreover, that the Numidian kings made use of Punic geographies and histories. The Roman writers Solinus and Ammianus, who may both have drawn on the same source for their material, refer to Punic books (libri Punici) consulted Juba II of Numidia. Solinus says &quot;The Nile rises in a mountain of lower Mauretania on the sea coast. This is stated, in the Punic books, and confirmed by King Juba, as we know. Ammianus says: &quot;King Juba II, said that. according to the Punic books the source of the Nile is in a mountain in Mauretania overlooking the Ocean. Moreover, Sallust states that Hiempsal of Numidia wrote one or more works in Punic:&quot; I will summarize briefly my information on the Punic books attributed to King Hiempsal (10).

When Hellenism began to influence Carthage and the Greeks settled there (in the fourth century B.C. there was still an important Greek colony there, according to Diodorus Siculus), a bilingual literature seems to have developed, with books in both Greek and Punic. We know of the existence of a History of the First Punic War by Philinus of Agrigentum, and the records of the campaigns of Hannibal compiled by his friends and teachers the Spartan Sosylus and Silenus, a fragment of which, the famous Hannibal's Dream, has been preserved in the works of Cicero and Livy. Hannibal himself, it is said, wrote several works in Greek and Punic. In his Lexicon Suidas mentions a certain Charon of Carthage who wrote a whole series of Lives of famous men and women as well as a history of the tyrants of Europe and Asia.

All that we know so far about the history of Carthage at home and abroad and everything we learn from the Punic inscriptions indicates the existence of a body of legal and political writings, doubtless very advanced. Statutes, codes, the decisions of the jurisprudents and some of the speeches made before the various assemblies must undoubtedly have been written down. It is unlikely, for instance, that the constitution of Carthage, which Aristotle held up as a model, was only known to him from hearsay. It is, moreover, reasonable to assume that Carthage too had actual didactic works of the type so common in the Semitic Orient, as well as a popular literature that would mostly be oral. However, parts of which must certainly have been taken down in writing in the form of collections of maxims, sayings, stories and proverbs after the manner of the Saying of Ahiqar. An original Punic proverb is preserved in a sermon of St. Augustine: &quot;There is a well known Punic proverb which I will tell you in Latin because not all of you understand Punic. Here it is: 'if the plague asks you for a crown, give it two and may it go away' (11). St. Jerome too refers to the existence of what is known today as erotic poetry in Punic. He believed it to be pernicious and described it as &quot;lewd&quot; (Latin: procacia) (12).

One may wonder about the possibility of the existence of philosophical works in Punic, an idea that I do not for a moment exclude. Such works certainly would not be entirely Punic in inspiration, and were probably affected by Hellenic influence. But even if they only reflect various movements in Greek philosophy, they must, on being translated into Punic, have been influenced to some extent by Punic thought and religion. On this subject one can cite the example of the stelae of Ghorfa, where the Neo-Pythagorean themes are clearly Punicised. We know, moreover, that long before the fall of Carthage there were several schools of Greek philosophy in the city, notably the Pythagorean, or Neo-Pythagorean, as well as the Neo-Academician. An outstanding name among the latter school was Hasdrubal, who was born in Carthage in the second century B.C. and went to Athens, where he became a celebrated philosopher under the name of Clitomachus. Diogenes Laertius refers to him in his Lives of the Philosophers: &quot;Clitomachus of Carthage was named Hasdrubal, and it was under his real name that he practiced at home. When he came to Athens at the age of forty he went to hear Carneades. The latter, seeing his great enthusiasm, made him a man of letters and educated him. His pupil worked so hard that he produced more than forty books. He took Carneades' place and annotated his best theories in his books. He contributed extensively to three different schools of thought -- the Academic, the Peripatetic and the Stoic&quot; (13). It could also be added that it is only through Hasdrubal-Clitomachus that we know something of the philosophy of Carneades, whom he succeeded in 129 B.C. As a specialist on Diogenes Laertius remarks, &quot;Hasdrubal seems to have added to the probabilism of Arcesilas a critical interpretation of certitude, and this makes him a forerunner of modem thought&quot;.

Punic Inscriptions
By far the largest part of the main body of known Punic inscriptions (several thousand, as we mentioned before) can be classed as religious literature. The longest and usually the most interesting of them are those dealing with the customary sacrifices in the Punic sanctuaries. These are the sacrificial tariffs promulgated by the magistrates in charge of the administration of the cult, who laid down the share due to the priests, according to the animal and the nature of the offering. Every sanctuary had its own particular tariff. Fragments of these lists have been found at Carthage, but the most complete text is that found at Marseilles in 1844 in the old port district (now in the Musée Borély), which originally came from Carthage. It read as follows:

&quot;Temple of Baal [tsaphon. Tariff of du] es which [the thirty men in charge of the du] es have fixed, in the time [of the magistracy of Khilletz] baal the Suffete, son of Bodtanit, son of Bod [eshmun and Khilletzbaal] 
the Suffete, son of Bodeshmun, son of Khilletzbaal and their col [leagues].&quot; 
&quot;For an ox, in expiatory sacrifice or in communion sacrifice or in holocaust: for the priests, ten (shekels) of silver each. And in expiatory sacrifice, they shall have, in addition to these dues, [a weight of 300 (shekels) of flesh 
and in communion sacrifice, the breast and the (right) thigh. The skin, the ribs (?), the feet and the rest of the flesh shall belong to the master of the sacrifice.&quot; 
&quot;For an uncastrated calf not yet horned, or for a deer, in expiator: sacrifice or in communion sacrifice or in holocaust: for the priests, five (shekels) of silver [each. In expiatory sacrifice, they shall have, 
in] addition to these dues, a weight of 150 (shekels) of flesh and, in communion sacrifice, the breast, and the thigh The skin, the ribs (?), the feet and the rest of the flesh shall belong to the master of the sacrifice].&quot; 
&quot;For a ram or a he-goat, in expiatory sacrifice or in communion sacrifice or in holocaust: for the priests, one shekel two zar of silver each. In communion sacrifice, they shall have, [in addition to these dues, the breast] 
and the (right) thigh. The skin, the ribs (?), the feet and the rest of the flesh shall belong to the master of the sacrifice.&quot; 
&quot;For a lamb or a kid or a fawn, in expiatory sacrifice or in communion sacrifice or in holocaust: for the priests, three-quarters (of a shekel) of silver and [two] zar [each. In communion sacrifice, they shall have, in addition] 
to these dues, the breast and the (right) thigh. The skin, the ribs (?), the feet and the rest of the flesh shall belong to the master [of the sacrifice].&quot; 
&quot;For a farmyard bird or a wild fowl, in holocaust or in exorcism sacrifice or in sacrifice for an augury: for the priests, three-quarters (of a shekel) of silver each. And the flesh shall belong to the master of the sacrifice].&quot; 
&quot;For an (other) bird or holy first fruits or for an offering of flour or an offering of oil: for the priests, ten ag[urot] of silver each...&quot; 
&quot;For each communion sacrifice which is offered before the god, the breast and the thigh shall belong to the priests. In communion sacrifice...&quot; 
&quot;For cake, for milk, for fat and for all sacrifices offered by a man in minkhat...&quot; 
&quot;For each sacrifice which is offered with cattle or with fowl, the pri[ests] shall have nothing.&quot; 
&quot;Every guild MZRH, every clan and every thiasos of the divinity and all men who shall offer sacrifice...&quot; 
&quot;These men (shall pay) the dues on one sacrifice only, according to what has been fixed in the writing ...&quot; 
&quot;All dues which are not set out on this table shall be given according to the writing [made by the thirty men in charge of the dues, in the time of the magistracy of Khilletzbaal, son of Bodtani]t and 
and of Khilletzbaal, son of Bodeshmun, and their colleagues.&quot; 
&quot;Every priest who shall collect dues other (?) than those fixed on this table, will be smitten with a fine...&quot; 
&quot;Every master of the sacrifice who shall not give [the money ? ac]cording to the dues...&quot; 
This Carthaginian sacrificial tariff is strikingly reminiscent, in its contents as well as its style, of the sacrificial rulings of the Israelites as they are detailed in the book of Leviticus.

The larger part of the religious texts comprises the innumerable votive inscriptions, mostly dedicated to the goddess Tanit or the god Baal Hammon, the chief deities of Carthage. These votive inscriptions are engraved on limestone stelae, often very ornate, which were apparently set up in various sanctuaries. The contents of the inscriptions are generally very much alike. They follow sacred formulae established once and for all, but fortunately an occasional sentence is found with some slight modification, innovation or addition. If these texts seem monotonous to the historian or to the unprejudiced observer, the same cannot be said of the epigraphist. Studied judiciously and minutely (which has not yet been done) they could without a doubt reveal a great deal of valuable information about religious, economic, social and even political life in Carthage. Here are some samples.

&quot;To the lady Tanit, the Face of Baal, and to the lord Baal Hammon, dedicated by Milkyaton, son of Maharbaal, son of Milkyaton, son of Aderbaal the Suffete, son of Hannibal&quot; (14).

&quot;To the lady Tanit, the Face of Baal, and to the lord Baal Hammon, dedicated by Abdmelqart, son of Ashtartyaton, who is of the attendants of the temple of Melqart&quot; (15).

&quot;To the lady Tanit, the Face of Baal, and to the lord Baal Hammon, dedicated by Muttunbaal, wife of Abdmelqart, son of Baalhanno, son of Bodashtart. Because they have heard her voice may they bless her.&quot; (16)

&quot;Has dedicated (this stele), Baalshillek, son of Akbar, for his son. May you hear his voice, may you bless him.&quot; (17)

'To the lady Tanit, the Face of Baal, and to the lord Baal Hammon, dedicated by Kanmi. servant (perhaps slave) of Eshmunamash, son of Baalyaton, for his flesh. May she bless him. And whosoever shall remove this stone against my will, or against the will of one acting in my name, may Tanit, the Face of Baal, condemn that man's spirit (soul).&quot; (18)

These examples suffice to show, in a manner of speaking, the variations in the apparent uniformity of the votive stelae. It is this variety, very much greater in reality than is generally apparent, which gives these brief inscriptions their importance.

Another, much less numerous, category is composed of funerary inscriptions. I will confine myself to two examples.

&quot;This is the tomb of Baalhanno, son of Bodashtart, son of Germelqart, son of Bodmelqart, the Mequim of the divinity.&quot; (19)

&quot;This is the tomb of Arishat, daughter of Philosir, son of Abdosir, wife of Abdeshmun, son of Himilco.&quot; (20)

The most interesting of the Punic epitaphs and also, unfortunately, the most difficult to read and interpret, is without a doubt that of Milkpilles, which was erected in his memory by a faithful friend. It also comes into the category of Punic texts relating to wills. What follows is the translation proposed by Mr. J.-G. Février (21).

&quot;Milkpilles, son of Bodmelqart, son of Milkpilles, son [...] Milkpilles, son of Melqartpilles, organizer of the sacred affairs, son [...] Milkherem. A stele in righteous aid I, Ashtzaph... in memory above the burial place of his remains, I have erected because he delighted in holy things... because, as a priest, he made holy offerings and served the gods with all his might during his lifetime, according to the writing and the plan; and I have written his name on high on the front (of the stele) for ever... in goodwill to him and for the greater glory of his remains. The chief of the clan, Sa[karbaal, son of] Yaroah. The temple of Isis. And I have engraved the inscription on [this] tablet.&quot; (22)

Commemorative inscriptions, although rare, are particularly interesting. All the known examples were, until the present, dedications of religious monuments. A short time ago, however, a new Punic inscription was found at Carthage, which was the first to commemorate a great public work, probably of the third century B.C. This inscription will be published by the young Tunisian scholar Mr. Mohamed Hassine Fantar. Rather than offer my own translation, which, in view of the difficulties of the Punic text, would require a detailed philological study for which this present article is unsuitable, I prefer to quote an English translation of the suggested version with notes and comments by Mr. André Dupont-Sommer (23).

&quot;Opened and made this street in the direction of the square at the New Gate in the south (?) wa[II, the people of Carthage, in the year] of the Suffetes Shafat and Adonibaal, in the time of the magistracy of Adonibaal, son of Eshmunkhilletz, son of... [son of Bodinel]qart, son of Hanno and their colleagues. (Were) in charge of this work Abdmelqart [son of.... son of. ---(as) foreman (?)]; Bodmelqart son of Baalhanno, son of Bodmelqart (as) chief engineer of public highways; Yehawwielon brother [of Bodmelqart (as) quarrier (?)]. [Also contributing to the enterprise were all] the merchants, the porters, the packers (?) who dwell in the level ground of the city, the weighers of small coinage (?) and [those] who have no [money, neither gold [?] nor silver (?), and also] those who have (money), the goldsmiths, the potters (?) and the (staff of) the workshops with kilns, and the sandal-makers (?) (all) together. And [if anyone shall (erase) this inscription] our accountants shall punish that man with a fine of 1000 (shekels of) silver -- one thousand -- in addition to [X] minae [to pay for the inscription (?)].&quot;

The Punic Passages in the &quot;Poenulus&quot; of Plautus
By far the most important of the Punic texts and glosses in Greek and Latin transcription are the passages in the Poenulus of Plautus. This unusual transcription poses a number of philological, epigraphic, literary and historical Problems. Even a brief summary would be impossible here, but 1 shall refer, if 1 may, to my own work on the subject (24). The main passage is a speech by the Carthaginian Hanno who has come to his native town in the hope of rediscovering his daughters, who were brought up from an early age in Carthage. The following is my own translation. &quot;I invoke the gods and goddesses of this place: I pray them to bring my endeavour to a successful outcome and to bless my journey. May 1, by the protection and justice of the gods, take back my daughters and my nephew here. Long ago my host was Antimidas ; they tell me his course is run. As to his son, of whom I spoke, I have been told that Agorastocles is to be found here. I have brought with me as proof this tessera hospitalis. I have heard that (Agorastocles) lives hereabouts. I will keep watch and find out from the people who come out.&quot; This comparatively extensive text is without doubt &quot;literary&quot; in character. But in fact it is nothing more than a translation into Punic of a Greek or Latin text (we cannot exclude the possibility that Plautus borrowed this text as it was from a Greek model), and the importance of this translation from our point of view lies in its evidence for the characteristics of Punic language and literature.

The &quot;Periplus&quot; of Hanno
We shall now revert to the record of the voyage which the famous Carthaginian leader Hanno undertook, probably on the orders of the Senate, beyond the Pillars of Hercules -- that is to say, on the Ocean. The Punic text of the record of this journey was engraved in the Temple of Chronos (Baal Hammon) at Carthage. There is only one Greek version, dating perhaps to the third century B.C. As J. Carcopino has shown, this has been modified to suit Greek tastes. The Greek text is no doubt less complete than the Punic original, but certain philological oddities can be found in it which indicate, as I believe, that it is an actual translation of a Punic text. It runs as follows:

&quot;Record of the voyage of King Hanno of Carthage round the lands of Libya which lie beyond the Pillars of Hercules. It has been engraved on tablets hung up in the Temple of Chronos.

&quot;The Carthaginians decided that Hanno should go past the Pillars and found Carthaginian cities. He set sail with sixty pentekontas carrying thirty thousand men and women with provisions and other necessities. After passing the Pillars of Hercules and sailing for two days beyond them we founded the first city, which was named Thymiaterion. Around it was a large plain. Next we went on in a westerly direction and arrived at the Libyan promontory of Soloeis, which is covered with trees; having set up a shrine to Poseidon, we set sail again towards the rising sun for half a day, after which we arrived at a lagoon close to the sea covered with many tall reeds. Elephants and large numbers of other animals were feeding on them. Leaving this lagoon and sailing for another day, we founded the coastal cities named Carian Wall, Gytte, Acra, Melitta and Arambys.

&quot;Leaving this place we arrived at the great river Lixos which comes from Libya. On the banks nomads, the Lixites, were feeding their flocks. We stayed for some time with these people and made friends with them. Upstream from them lived the unfriendly Ethiopians whose land is full of wild beasts and broken up by high mountains where they say the Lixos rises. They also say that about these mountains dwell the strange-looking Troglodytes. The Lixites claim that they can run faster than horses. Taking Lixite interpreters with us we sailed alongside the desert in a southerly direction for two days, then towards the rising sun for one more day. We then found at the far end of an inlet a little island five stades in circumference. We named it Cerne and left settlers there. judging by our journey we reckoned that it must be opposite Carthage, since we had to sail the same distance from Carthage to the Pillars of Hercules as from the Pillars of Hercules to Cerne. From there, sailing up a big river named the Chretes, we arrived at a lake in which there were three islands, all larger than Cerne. Leaving these islands, we sailed for one day and came to the end of the lake, which was overshadowed by high mountains full of savages dressed in animal skins that threw stones at us and thus prevented us from landing. From there we entered another river, which was big and wide, full of crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Then we retraced our journey back to Cerne.

&quot;From there we sailed south along a coast entirely inhabited by Ethiopians, who fled at our approach. Their language was incomprehensible even to the Lixites, whom we had with us. On the last day we disembarked by some high mountains covered with trees with sweet-smelling multicoloured wood. We sailed round these mountains for two days and arrived in a huge bay on the other side of which was a plain; there we saw fires breaking out at intervals on all sides at night, both great and small. Having renewed our water supplies, we continued our voyage along the coast for five days, after which we arrived at a huge inlet, which the interpreters called the Horn of the West. There was a big island in this gulf and in the island was a lagoon with another island. Having disembarked there, we could see nothing but forest by day ; but at night many fires were seen and we heard the sound of flutes and the beating of drums and tambourines, which made a great noise. We were struck with terror and our soothsayers bade us leave the island.

&quot;We left in haste and sailed along by a burning land full of perfumes. Streams of fire rose from it and plunged into the sea. The land was unapproachable because of the heat. Terror-stricken, we hastened away. During four days' sailing we saw at night that the land was covered with fire. In the middle was a high flame, higher than the others, which seemed to reach the stars. By day we realised that it was a very high mountain, named the Chariot of the Gods. Leaving this place, we sailed along the burning coast for three days and came to the gulf named the Horn of the South. At the end of it was an island like the first one, with a lake in which was another island full of savages. The greater parts of these were women. They had hairy bodies and the interpreters called them Gorillas. We pursued some of the males but we could not catch a single one because they were good climbers and they defended themselves fiercely. However, we managed to take three women. They bit and scratched their captors, whom they did not want to follow. We killed them and removed the skins to take back to Carthage. We sailed no further, being short of supplies.&quot; Considered solely from the literary viewpoint, this can only be regarded as a marvellous record of a journey, a true and highly readable adventure story. What strikes me particularly in this composition is the quality, I might even say the modernity, of the style.

Mago's Treatise on Agriculture
Although they were best known as traders and navigators, the Carthaginians were also, after a certain period at least, highly expert farmers. Various references and notes in Greek and Roman authors such as Diodorus Siculus, Polybius and Ennius state plainly that Carthaginian agriculture was in a prosperous condition. That the Carthaginians looked on the improvement of agriculture as a real science is proved by the existence at Carthage of several highly renowned works on agriculture. The best known of these was unquestionably that of Mago, which was known, appreciated and copied by the Greeks and Romans, as it was later by the Byzantines and the Arabs. This monumental work in twenty-eight books was the only one -- of all those saved from the fire which destroyed the libraries of Carthage in 146 B.C. -- to be appropriated by the Romans and accorded the distinguished honour of an official Latin translation. We are told by Pliny the Elder: &quot;After the sack of Carthage, our Senate presented the libraries of the town to the African princes, with the sole exception of the twenty-eight books of Mago, which they decreed should be translated into Latin. However, Cato had already written his own work on the subject. The text was entrusted to scholars learned in the Punic language. The chief part was taken by D. Silanus, a man of high birth.&quot; (25) The treatise was also translated into Creek by Cassius Dionysius of Utica.

It goes without saying that nothing has survived of the original work of Mago in Punic ; and ever the Greek and Latin versions are lost. We have in all about forty quotations of varying length from Mago's work, scattered here and there in the work of various Roman authors, principally Varro, Columella, Pliny and others such as Gargilius Martialis. We know that Mago's work covered all branches of agriculture. It is not impossible that he consulted some Greek works on the subject, but his treatise is pre-eminently a native Punic product concerned with farming in North Africa. The surviving quotations mostly deal with cereal crops, vines, olive and other fruit trees, vegetables, the breeding of horses, mules and oxen, farmyard animals, bee-keeping, and the internal organisation of the farm. To give an idea of the style and literary construction of Mago's work (if, indeed, it is possible to discern them from Latin translation), I shall quote some typical passages.

In the section on cereals, for example, there is a recipe for grinding wheat and barley:

&quot;Soak the wheat in plenty of water and then pound it with a pestle, dry it in the sun and put it back under the pestle. The procedure for barley is the same. For twenty setiers of barley you need two setiers of water&quot; (26).

The Carthaginians made raisin wine that was very popular with the Romans, and we are fortunate enough to know Mago's instructions for making it:

&quot;Pick some well-ripened early grapes ; discard any which are mildewed or damaged. Drive into the ground forked branches or stakes made of rods tied into bundles, at a distance of about four feet apart. Lay reeds across them and spread the grapes out in the sun on top. Cover them at night so that the dew will not moisten them. When they are dried, pick the grapes off the stems and put them in a jar or pitcher. Add some unfermented wine, the best you have, until the grapes are just covered. After six days, when the grapes have absorbed it all and are swollen, put them in a basket, put them through the press and collect the resulting liquid. Next press the marc, adding fresh unfermented wine made with other grapes which have been left in the sun for three days. Stir it well, and put it trough the press. Bottle at once in luted vessels the liquid produced by this second pressing, so that it will not turn sour. After twenty or thirty days when the fermentation is over, decant it into fresh vessels. Coat the lids with plaster and cover them with leather&quot; (27).

Finally, here are Mago's instructions on how to select oxen.

&quot;They must be young, stocky and sturdy of limb with long horns, darkish and healthy, a wide and wrinkled forehead, hairy ears and black eyes and chops, the nostrils well-opened and turned back, the neck long and muscular, the dewlap full and descending to the knees, the chest well-developed, broad shoulders, the belly big like that of a cow in calf, the flanks long, the loins broad, the back straight and flat or a little depressed in the middle, the buttocks rounded, the legs thick and straight, rather short than long, the knees straight, the hooves large, the tail long and hairy and the hair on the body thick and short, red c brown in colour and very soft to the touch.&quot; (28)

It must be admitted that this long description with its remarkably precise choice of words, has a flavour and beauty all its own. It is not difficult to understand why this admirable work of Mago was so famous for so long. Precision, brevity and sobriety as they are exemplified here were, in general, the dominant characteristics of Punic literature. These Phoenicians of the West, although at heart they were closely related to their eastern brothers, knew how to restrain their imagination better than the Orientals. The Carthaginians' imagination was always tempered by their alert intelligence and their outstanding common sense. However, their creative power, sensitivity and feeling, although often veiled, breaks out from time to time through the apparent aridity of style and thought, as we see from the Periplus of Hanno, the extracts from Mago, and even from some of the inscriptions.

In the fourth century A.D. when Punic was still spoken as a living language, St. Augustine had no reservation in stating in a letter addressed to the orator Maximus Madaurus that: &quot;on the word of many scholars, there was a great deal of virtue and wisdom in the Punic books&quot;. This certainly appears to be true of Carthaginian literature when it is studied from the inside, and not just via the distorting mirror held up by their enemies and rivals, the Greeks and Romans.

The Motherland, Phoenicia Proper -- Canaan 
   
The Motherland, Phoenicia Proper

By the 2nd millennium BC the Phoenicians had already extended their influence along the coast of the Levant by a series of settlements, some well known, some virtually nothing but names. Well known throughout history are Joppa (Tel Aviv-Yafo) and Dor (later Tantura, modern Nasholim) in the south.

The gays boundaries of the territory were Phoenicians lived are vague, and the name Phoenicia may be applied to all those places on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean where the Phoenicians established colonies in Cyprus, North Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, and Iberia. More often it refers to the heart of the territory where the great Phoenician cities, notably Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos stood (corresponding roughly to the coast of present-day Lebanon with adjoining parts of modern Syria, Turkey and Israel -- probably somewhere around the lower right edge of Turkey on the Mediterranean in the North and the upper cost of Sinia in the South through the coastal area from Arvad in the north to Acco in the south is a more realistic identification of what constituted Phoenicia). Further, important Phoenician centers existed c.2800 B.C. at Jerusalem, Jericho, Ai, and Megiddo. These territories expanded and contracted depending the political climate and military influences that came into play. Hence, Phoenicia meant different territorities in different times but always include the Phoenician heartland around the aforesaid great Phoenician cities.

During the Roman Empire territories and provinces changed hands and form depending on the political climat in Rome and arbitrary partitions which were applied to various parts of the empire. The province of Syria was partitioned into two parts: Syria Coele (&quot;Hollow Syria&quot;), comprising a large region loosely defined as north and east Syria; and Syria Phoenice in the southwestern region, which included not only coastal Phoenicia but also the territory beyond the mountains and into the Syrian desert. Under the provincial reorganization of the Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius II in the early 5th century AD, Syria Phoenice was expanded into two provinces: Phoenice Prima (Maritima), basically ancient Phoenicia; and Phoenice Secunda (Libanesia), an area extending to Mt. Lebanon on the west and deep into the Syrian desert on the east. Phoenice Secunda included the cities of Emesa (its capital), Heliopolis, Damascus, and Palmyra. In many respects, the two most important cities of Lebanon during the time of the Roman Empire were Heliopolis and Berytus. At Heliopolis the Roman emperors, particularly the Severans, constructed a monumental temple complex, the most spectacular elements of which were the Temple of Jupiter Heliopolitanus and the Temple of Bacchus. Berytus, on the other hand, became the seat of the most famous provincial school of Roman law. The school, which probably was founded by Septimius Severus, lasted until the destruction of Berytus itself by a sequence of earthquakes, tidal wave, and fire in the mid-6th century. Two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, both natives of Lebanon, taught as professors at the law school under the Severans. Their judicial opinions constitute well over a third of the Pandects (Digest) contained in the great compilation of Roman law commissioned by the emperor Justinian I in the 6th century AD. In 608-609 the Persian king Khosrow II pillaged Syria and Lebanon and reorganized the area into a new satrapy, excluding only Phoenicia Maritima. Between 622 and 629 the Byzantine emperor Heraclius mounted an offensive and restored Syria-Lebanon to his empire. This success was short-lived; in the 630s Muslim Arabs conquered Palestine and Lebanon, and the old Phoenician cities offered only token resistance to the invader.

Tyre

Coastal town and a major Phoenician seaport from about 2000 BC onwards through the Roman period. It is frequently mentioned in the works of the Hirodotus when he made visits to the city and its temples.

It was built on an island and the neighbouring mainland, and was probably originally founded as a colony of Sidon to the north and was mentioned in Egyptian records of the 14th century BC as being subject to Egypt. It became independent when Egyptian influence in Phoenicia declined and soon surpassed Sidon as a trade centre, developing commercial relations with all parts of the Mediterranean world. In the 9th century BC colonists from Tyre founded in northern Africa the city of Carthage, which later became Rome's principal rival in the West. The town is frequently mentioned in the Bible as having had close ties with Israel. Hiram, king of Tyre, furnished building materials for Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem (10th century), and the notorious Jezebel, wife of King Ahab, was the daughter of Ethbaal &quot;king of Tyre and Sidon.&quot; In the 10th and 9th centuries Tyre probably enjoyed some primacy over the other cities of Phoenicia and was ruled by kings whose power was limited by a merchant oligarchy.

For much of the 8th and 7th centuries the town was subject to Assyria, and in 585-573 it successfully withstood a prolonged siege by the Babylonian king Nebuchadrezzar II. Between 538 and 332 it was ruled by the Achaemenian kings of Persia. In this period it lost its hegemony in Phoenicia but continued to flourish. Probably the most famous episode in the history of Tyre was its resistance to the army of the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great, who took it after a seven-month siege in 332, using floating batteries and building a causeway to gain access to the island. After its capture, 10,000 of the inhabitants were put to death, and 30,000 were sold into slavery. Alexander's causeway, which was never removed, converted the island into a peninsula.

Tyre was subsequently under the influence of Ptolemaic Egypt and in 200 became part of the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom; it finally came under Roman rule in 68 BC. It was often mentioned in the New Testament and was famous in Roman times for its silk products and for a purple dye extracted from snails of the genus Murex. By the 2nd century AD it had a sizable Christian community, and the Christian scholar Origen was buried there (c. 254). Under Muslim rule from 638 to 1124, Tyre grew prosperous as part of the kingdom of Jerusalem, a crusader state in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Holy Roman emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, who died on the Third Crusade, was buried in its cathedral (1190). Captured and destroyed by the Muslim Mamluks in 1291, the town never recovered its former importance.

The silted up harbour on the south side of the peninsula has been excavated by the French Institute for Archaeology in the Near East, but most of the remains of the Phoenician period still lie beneath the present town. Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.

Sidon

One of the ancient Phoenician cities on the Mediterranean coast, was founded in the 3rd millennium BC and became prosperous in the 2nd. It is frequently mentioned in the works of the Greek poet Homer and in the Old Testament; and it was ruled in turn by Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Alexander the Great, the Seleucids of Syria, the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, and the Romans. At that time Sidon was famous for its purple dyes and glassware. Herod I the Great embellished the city, and Jesus visited it. During the Crusades, Sidon changed hands several times and was destroyed and rebuilt.

A large necropolis has yielded numerous sarcophagi (stone coffins), including those of two Sidonian kings of the Phoenician period, Eshmunazar and Tennes, and the famous Alexander sarcophagus, depicting battle and hunting scenes, now at Istanbul. Other ruins include two crusader castles and the Phoenician Temple of Eshmun (Eachmoun).

Berytus (Beritus/Beritos) -- Modern Beirut

The antiquity of Berytus is indicated by its name, derived from the Canaanite name of Be`erot (Wells), referring to the underground water table that is still tapped by the local inhabitants for general use. Although the city is mentioned in Egyptian records of the 2nd millennium BC, it did not gain prominence until it was granted the status of a Roman colony, the Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Berytus, in 14 BC. The original town was located in the valley between the hills of Al-Ashrafiyah and Al-Musaytibah. Its suburbs were also fashionable residential areas under the Romans. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, Berytus was famous for its School of Law. The Roman city was destroyed by a succession of earthquakes, culminating in the quake and tidal wave of AD 551. When the Muslim conquerors occupied Berytus in 635, it was still mostly in ruins.

Berytus was conquered by the military forces of the First Crusade and was organized, along with its coastal suburbs, as a fief of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem.

As a crusader outpost, Berytus conducted a flourishing trade with Genoa and other Italian cities and became the chief port of call in area for the spice merchants from Venice.

Byblos

Biblical GEBAL, ancient seaport, the site of which is located on the Mediterranean coast about 20 miles (32 km) north of the Berytus; it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world. The name Byblos is Greek; papyrus received its early Greek name (byblos, byblinos) from its being exported to the Aegean through Byblos. Hence the English word Bible is derived from byblos as &quot;the (papyrus) book.&quot;

Systematic excavations were begun at Byblos by Pierre Montet in 1921; in 1926 Maurice Dunand resumed the work and continued it for many years. The excavations revealed that Byblos was occupied at least by the Neolithic period (c. 8000-c. 4000 BC) and that during the 4th millennium BC an extensive settlement developed.

Because Byblos was the chief harbour for the export of cedar and other valuable wood to Egypt, it soon became a great trading centre; it was called Kubna in ancient Egyptian and Gubla in Akkadian, the language of Assyria. Egyptian monuments and inscriptions found on the site attest to close relations with the Nile valley throughout the second half of the 2nd millennium. During Egypt's 12th dynasty (1938-1756 BC), Byblos again became an Egyptian dependency, and the chief goddess of the city, Baalat (&quot;The Mistress&quot;), with her well-known temple at Byblos, was worshiped in Egypt. After the collapse of the Egyptian New Kingdom in the 11th century BC, Byblos became the foremost city of Phoenicia.

Byblos has yielded almost all of the known early Phoenician inscriptions, most of them dating from the 10th century BC. By that time, however, the Sidonian kingdom, with its capital at Tyre, had become dominant in Phoenicia, and Byblos, though it flourished into Roman times, never recovered its former supremacy. The crusaders captured the town in 1103 and called it Gibelet, but they later lost it to the Ayyubid sultan Saladin in 1189.

The ruins today consist of the crusader ramparts and gate; a Roman colonnade and small theatre; Phoenician ramparts, three major temples, and a necropolis.

Ugarit

The site was first occupied in the neolithic period, that is, the 4th millenium BC. Like so many other sites, it went through periods of habitation and destruction. It was destroyed by fire sometime between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC. It was allied with Egypt during the 19th and 18th centuries, which proved to be its most prosperous time. In the 18th century it was conquered by the Hurrians and ruled by them until the 16th century. It suffered a terrible earthquake in the 1300's but was rebuilt only to be destroyed about 1200 BC by the Sea Peoples.

A more detailed history will follow.

Baalbeck

In many respects, the two most important cities of Phoenicia during the time of the Roman Empire were Heliopolis and Berytus. At Heliopolis the Roman emperors, particularly the Severans, constructed a monumental temple complex, the most spectacular elements of which were the Temple of Jupiter Heliopolitanus and the Temple of Bacchus.


Phoenician Colonies 
 
Phoenician Settlements Outside the Motherland 

North Africa and Spain 
The Mediterranean and North African coast (with the exception of Cyrenaica) entered the mainstream of Mediterranean history with the arrival in the 1st millennium BC of Phoenician traders, mainly from Tyre and Sidon in the eastern Mediterranean. The Phoenicians were not looking for land to settle but for anchorages and staging points on the trade route from Phoenicia to Spain, a source of silver and tin. Points on an alternative route by way of Sicily, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands also were occupied. The Phoenicians lacked the manpower and the need to found large colonies as the Greeks did, and few of their settlements grew to any size. The sites chosen were generally offshore islands or easily defensible promontories with sheltered beaches on which ships could be drawn up. Carthage -- Cartagine in italiano --(from the Phoenician Kart-Hadasht, New City or Land, founded by Queen Elissar of Tyre), destined to be the largest Phoenician colony and in the end an imperial power, conformed to the pattern.

Tradition dated the foundation of Gades (modern Cádiz; the earliest known Phoenician trading post in Spain) to 1110 BC, Utica (Utique) to 1101 BC, and Carthage to 814 BC. The dates appear legendary, and no Phoenician object earlier than the 8th century BC has yet been found in the west. At Carthage some Greek objects have been found, datable to about 750 or slightly later, which comes within two generations of the traditional date. Little can be learned from the romantic legends about the arrival of the Phoenicians at Carthage transmitted by Greco-Roman sources. Though individual voyages doubtless took place earlier, the establishment of permanent posts is unlikely to have taken place before 800 BC, antedating the parallel movement of Greeks to Sicily and southern Italy.

Material evidence of Phoenician occupation in the 8th century BC comes from Utica, and of the 7th or 6th century BC from Hadrumetum (Susah, Sousse), Tipasa (east of Cherchell), Siga (Rachgoun), Lixus, and Mogador (Essaouira), the last being the most distant Phoenician settlement so far known. Finds of similar age have been made at Motya (Mozia) in Sicily, Nora (Nurri), Sulcis, and Tharros (San Giovanni di Sinis), Bithia and Olbia in Sardinia, and Cádiz and Almuñécar in Spain. Unlike the Greek settlements, however, those of the Phoenicians long remained politically dependent on their homeland, and only a few were situated where the hinterland had the potential for development. The emergence of Carthage as an independent power, leading to the creation of an empire based on the secure possession of the North African coast, resulted less from the weakening of Tyre, the chief city of Phoenicia, by the Babylonians than from growing pressure from the Greeks in the western Mediterranean; in 580 BC some Greek cities in Sicily attempted to drive the Phoenicians from Motya and Panormus (Palermo) in the west of the island. The Carthaginians feared that if the Greeks won the whole of Sicily they would move on to Sardinia and beyond, isolating the Phoenicians in North Africa. The successful defense of Sicily was followed by attempts to strengthen limited footholds in Sardinia; a fortress at Monte Sirai is the oldest Phoenician military building in the west. The threat from the Greeks receded when Carthage, in alliance with Etruscan cities, backed the Phoenicians of Corsica in about 540 BC and succeeded in excluding the Greeks from contact with southern Spain.

Venerable historical traditions recount the Phoenician voyages to found new cities. Utica, on the Tunisian coast of North Africa, was reputedly founded in 1178 BC, and by 1100 BC the Phoenician city of Tyre supposedly had a Spanish colony at Gadir (Cadiz). Although intriguing, these historical traditions are unsupported by evidence. Excavations confirm that the Phoenicians settled in southern Spain after 800 BC. Their search for new commodities led them ever farther westward and was the reason for their interest in southern Spain's mineral wealth. The untapped lodes of silver and alluvial deposits of tin and gold provided essential raw materials with which to meet the increasing Assyrian demands for tribute. By 700 BC silver exported from the Río Tinto mines was so abundant that it depressed the value of silver bullion in the Assyrian world. This is the background for Phoenician interest in the far west.

Phoenician commerce was conducted by family firms of shipowners and manufacturers who had their base in Tyre or Byblos and placed their representatives abroad. This accounts for the rich tombs of Phoenician pattern found at Almuñécar, Trayamar, and Villaricos, equipped with metropolitan goods such as alabaster wine jars, imported Greek pottery, and delicate gold jewelery. Maritime bases from the Balearic Islands (Ibiza) to Cadiz on the Atlantic were set up to sustain commerce in salted fish, dyes, and textiles. Early Phoenician settlements are known from Morro de Mezquitilla, Toscanos, and Guadalhorce and shrines from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar and the Temple of Melqart on the island of Sancti Petri near Cadiz. After the fall of Tyre to the Babylonians in 573 BC and the subjugation of Phoenicia, the early prosperity faded until the 4th century. Many colonies survived, however, and Abdera (Adra), Baria (Villaricos), Carmona (Carmo), Gadir (Cadiz), Malaca (Málaga), and Sexi (Almuñécar) thrived under the trading system established by Carthage for the central and western Mediterranean. Eivissa (Ibiza) became a major Carthaginian colony, and the island produced dye, salt, fish sauce, and wool. A shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuyram, and the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. In 237 BC, just before the Second Punic War, Carthage launched its conquest of southern Spain under Hamilcar Barca, founded a new capital city at Cartago Nova (Cartagena) in 228 BC, and suffered crushing defeat by the Romans in 206 BC.

The Colonies, Phoenicia's Diaspora

Among the most outstanding colonies or trading posts which the Phoenicians had established were the cities of Genoa, where they went in with the Celts and established a flourishing colony, and Marseille which they started as nothing more than a trading post before it became fully Hellenized.

It is very probable that the tremendous colonial activity of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians was stimulated in the 8th to 6th centuries BC by the military blows that were wrecking the trade of the Phoenician homeland in the Levant. Also, competition with the synchronous Greek colonization of the western Mediterranean cannot be ignored as a contributing factor.

The earliest site outside the Phoenician homeland known to possess important aspects of Phoenician culture is Ugarit (Ras Shamra), about six miles north of Latakia. The site was already occupied before the 4th millennium BC, but the Phoenicians only became prominent there around 1991-1786 BC.

According to Herodotus, the coast of Libya along the sea which washes it to the north, throughout its entire length from Egypt to Cape Soloeis, which is its furthest point, is inhabited by Libyans of many distinct tribes who possess the whole tract except certain portions which belong to the Phoenicians and the Greeks.

Tyre's first colony, Utica in North Africa, was founded perhaps as early as the 10th century BC. It is likely that the expansion of the Phoenicians at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC is to be connected with the alliance of Hiram of Tyre with Solomon of Israel in the second half of the 10th century BC. In the following century, Phoenician presence in the north is shown by inscriptions at Samal (Zincirli Hüyük) in eastern Cilicia, and in the 8th century at Karatepe in the Taurus Mountains, but there is no evidence of direct colonization. Both these cities acted as fortresses commanding the routes through the mountains to the mineral and other wealth of Anatolia.

Cyprus had Phoenician settlements by the 9th century BC. Citium, known to the Greeks as Kition (biblical Kittim), in the southeast corner of the island, became the principal colony of the Phoenicians in Cyprus. Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, several smaller settlements were planted as stepping-stones along the route to Spain and its mineral wealth in silver and copper: at Malta, early remains go back to the 7th century BC, and at Sulcis and Nora in Sardinia and Motya in Sicily, perhaps a century earlier. According to Thucydides, the Phoenicians controlled a large part of the island but withdrew to the northwest corner under pressure from the Greeks. Modern scholars, however, disbelieve this and contend that the Phoenicians arrived only after the Greeks were established.

In North Africa the next site colonized after Utica was Carthage (near Tunis). Carthage in turn seems to have established (or, in some cases, reestablished) a number of settlements in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, the Balearic Islands, and southern Spain, eventually making this city the acknowledged leader of the western Phoenicians.

Leptis Magna, a titular see of Tripolitana was founded by the Sidonians in a fine and fertile country, it was the most important of the three towns which formed the Tripoli Confederation (Libya toay). The remains of the ancient Phœnician town are still visible, with the harbour, quays, walls, and inland defence, which make it look like Carthage. This city subsequently became the centre of a Greek city, Neapolis, of which most of the monuments are buried under sand. Notwithstanding Pliny (Nat. Hist., V, xxviii), who distinguishes Neapolis from Leptis, there is no doubt, according to Ptolemy, Strabo, and Scyllax, that they should be identified. Leptis allied itself with the Romans in the war against Jugurtha. Having obtained under Augustus the title of civitas it seems at that time to have been administered by Carthaginian magistrates; it may have been a municipium during the first century of the Christian Era and erected by Trajan into a colony bearing the name of Colonia Ulpia Trajana, found on many of its coins. The birthplace of Septimius Severus, who embellished it and enriched it with several fine monuments, it was taken and sacked in the fourth century by the Libyan tribe of Aurusiani (Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVIII, vi) and has never since completely recovered. It was at that time the seat of the military government of Tripolitana. 

Carthage

Phoenician KART-HADASHT, Latin CARTHAGO, great city of antiquity, traditionally founded on the north coast of Africa by the Phoenicians of Tyre in 814 BC. It is now a residential suburb of the city of Tunis. Its Phoenician name means New Town or Land.

A brief treatment of ancient Carthage follows. For full treatment, see North Africa: History.

Various traditions concerning the foundation of Carthage were current among the Greeks, who called the city Karchedon; but the Roman tradition is better known because of the Aeneid, which tells of the city's foundation by the Tyrian princess Elissar or Elyssa (Dido in Greek), who fled from her brother Pygmalion (the name of a historical king of Tyre who ruled a century after Hiram). The inhabitants were known to the Romans as Poeni, a derivation from the word Phoenikes (Phoenicians), from which the adjective Punic is derived. According the Greek historian Timaeus (c. 356-260 B.C.), Carthage was founded in 814 B.C. by a Elyssa who gathered up the royal treasury and a group of supporters and traveled to Cyprus, another Phoenician colony. Thereafter she traveled to North Africa where present day country of Tunis is.

The site chosen for Carthage in the centre of the shore of the Gulf of Tunis was ideal: the city was built on a triangular peninsula covered with low hills and backed by the Lake of Tunis with its safe anchorage and abundant supplies of fish. The site of the city was well protected and easily defensible. On the south the peninsula is connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land. The ancient citadel, the Byrsa, was on a low hill overlooking the sea. It is said, the local Berber permitted Elyssa and her people to have as much land at that which could be covered with a single oxhide. Hence, she was supposed to have cut an oxhide into thin strips and encircled the hill. Some of the earliest tombs have been found there, though nothing remains of Carthage's domestic and public buildings. Byrsa means fortress in Phoenician. Byrsa in Greek and Latin mean hide from which bourse or stock-market, and purse are derived.

The standard of cultural life enjoyed by the Carthaginians was probably far below that of the larger cities of the classical world. Punic interests were turned toward commerce. In Roman times Punic beds, cushions, and mattresses were regarded as luxuries, and Punic joinery and furniture were copied. Much of the revenue of Carthage came from its exploitation of the silver mines of North Africa and southern Spain, begun as early as 800 BC.

From the middle of the 3rd century to the middle of the 2nd century BC, Carthage was engaged in a series of wars with Rome called the Punic Wars. These wars, which are known as the Punic Wars, ended in the complete defeat of Carthage by Rome. When Carthage finally fell in 146 BC, the site was plundered and burned, and all human habitation there was forbidden.

Around Memphis

Phoenicians from the city of Tyre dwell all round memphis, and the whole place is known by the name of &quot;the camp of the Tyrians.&quot; Within the enclosure stands a temple, which is called that of Venus the Stranger.

Phoenician Mathematical Geography, Maps and Masters of Cartography in the Ancient World

* http://www.phoenicia.org/maphall.htm
* http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/

Marinus of Tyre, Phoenicia, (ca. 70-130 A.D.) was a geographer and mathematician, as well as the founder of mathematical geography. His chief merits were that he assigned to each place its proper latitude and longtitude with equal spacing for lines (ca. 100 A.D.), and introduced improvements to the construction of maps and developed a system of nautical charts. His charts used the city of Rhodes as a central point of reference. He also carefully studied the works of his predecessors and the diaries of travellers. His maps were the first in the Roman Empire to show China. 

Around 120 A.D., Marinus wrote that the habitable world was bounded on the west by the Fortunate Islands. The status of the Fortunate Islands as the western edge of the known world was more formally established when Claudius Ptolemy (90 - 168 A.D.) adopted the Fortunate Islands as the prime meridian for his Geographia, written ca. 150 A.D. He acknowledged his great obligations to Marinus. Geographia was lost to the west during most of the Medieval period, but was rediscovered during the fifteenth century. It was the most famous classical map of the world, unsurpassed for almost 1500 years. The sources that Ptolemy cited most consistently were the maps and writings of Marinus, as well as adopting his ideas and practices. Ptolemy’s commentaries on Marinus are the only records remaining about the latter’s work, as none of his maps or texts has survived. 

1700 years before the modern discovery of the source of the Nile, Marinus wrote an account of a journey to the Ruwenzori ca. 110 A.D. He related the tale of a Greek merchant, Diogenes who claimed a 25 day journey inland from the African East coast to &quot;two great lakes and the snowy range of mountains where the Nile draws it's twin sources.&quot; Ptolemy and Marinus were major authorities used by Columbus in determining the circumference of the globe.

Phoenicia's Hall of Maps 
The collection of maps in this virtual hall provides a visual tour on the evolution of cartography through centuries, from 6200 B.C. till the Roman era. In addition, maps of Phoenicia Prima, the Phoenician Colonies, Settlements and Trading Posts, and a unique Phoenician coin which is believed to contain a map of the world.

Recognition: This page and the related Phoenicia's Hall of Maps were inspired by Dr. Gavin Francis, a physician and history enthusiast with The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Research station located Latitude 75°35' S, Longitude 26°34' W, Brunt Ice Shelf, Coats Land, Antartica. I am indebted to Dr. Francis for writing to me about this important subject.

Phoenician Canaanite Names of Towns and Cities

* http://www.phoenicia.org/imgs/canaantwns.jpg

The above map clearly shows that the Phoenician/ Canaanites had settled the mountains quite extensively, contrary to what was previously believed. 

Both researchers, Wild and Kuschke, are aware there are many more Canaanite settlements whose names had shifted from Canaanite to Aramaic and then some to Arabic.

Limiting names at present to Phoenician/Canaanite ones, presents the least extention of their settlements. Further study is needed to map the full extent of Canaanite settlement in the Lebanese mountains.

The numbers refer to the placement of the locations on the map. In this list A. Kuschke includes the 50 place-names which Stephan Wild (in his Libanesische Ortsnamen) considers to be Canaanite. Kuschke adds 25 more names which he deems to be of Canaanite origin. 

The aim of Kuschke with his article is to map the distribution of Canaanite/Phoenician settlement in Lebanon.

Summary  
PharaohsU distant ancestors left a stunning legacy that has remained hidden for 6,000 years: hundreds of intricate rock carvings that tell about their lifestyle and their deepest beliefs. &quot;Genesis of the Pharaohs&quot; traces the discovery of these ancient records, and discovers the answer to the question of where, when, and how ancient Egypt began. 88 illustrations.

Review  
Modern scholars have tended to accept that the brilliant civilization of the pharaohs is the product of the rich agricultural surpluses of the Nile floodplain. But ancient rock carvings tell a different story, according to this illustrated treatise on ancient Egypt. Archaeologist Wilkinson specializes in rock art in the region between the Nile and the Red Sea dating from the 5th millennium B. C., when this now-desert area was verdant grassland. These pre-Pharaonic carvings, he argues, are a complex mixture of motifs, depicting crocodiles, hippos and boats from the Nile alongside ostriches and giraffes from the savannah, and suffused with cattle imagery and the religious symbolism that would characterize classical Egyptian art. This evidence, he asserts, shows that pre-Pharaonic Egyptians were not settled flood-plain farmers, but semi-nomadic herders who drove their cattle in between the lush riverbanks and the drier grasslands-a legacy evident, for example, in the Egyptian royal sceptre, which looks like a shepherd's crook. Wilkinson argues for Egyptian civilization's deep roots in a distinctive African landscape. His theory tacitly challenges an orthodoxy that holds that civilization sprang from efforts to irrigate land around the great rivers of Egypt, Mesopotamia and China; &quot;cultural complexity,&quot; he writes, &quot;was not borne of an easy agricultural lifestyle by the banks of the river, but of the fight for survival in more difficult terrain.&quot; Wilkinson wears his erudition lightly and provides an engaging and clearly written guide to the arcana of pre-historic Egyptology. His book is an invigorating contribution to a vital historiographical debate. 87 illustrations, 25 in color. (June) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.

Summary  
Sabra Moore offers a treasury of faithful artistic renderings of ancient native art from all regions of the North American continent. Accompanying her drawings are descriptions designed for the general reader that provide information on the location of each work of art; the culture from which it came; and what is known about its significance and meaning for the people who created it. The images include animals and objects, humans, hybrid human-animal forms, symbols, calendars and star markers, and celestial beings incised in caves, on cliffs and boulders, on artifacts, and even under water. This book is an appealing introduction to this unique art form -- its range, diversity, and locations -- as well as a record of many sites that are endangered or damaged or have recently been destroyed. Sabra Moore is an artist residing in New Mexico. She has created fifteen artist's books, some of which are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and other institutions. She has exhibited extensively in New York, Canada. New Mexico, and Brazil, and her drawings appear in Through Indian Eyes and a recent edition of Bulfinch's Mythology.

Review  
Though not intended as a survey (the subject matter is too broad), this book provides a glimpse of the beautiful artwork created by Native Americans through the centuries with 106 excellent renderings of petroglyphs and pictographs taken from such diverse media as rocks and shells. Carefully drawn by Moore, a professional artist, the pictures provide more detail than is often conveyed by photographs. Images from across the United States are subdivided by region. Also included are regional listings of sites where tourists can view some of the originals, though names and phone numbers of places to contact for information are unfortunately not included. The pictures are accompanied by descriptive text that helps put the artwork in context both historically and artistically. While the book does include a bibliography, it does not show the type of scholarly rigor that would make it of interest to academic collections. Recommended for public libraries.--John Burch, Hagan Memorial Lib., Williamsburg, KY

Review  
Crosby spent a large part of the 1960s and1970s doggedly ferreting out prehistoric rock art sites in the mid-peninsula region of Baja. This complete revision of a shorter work first published in 1975 reveals that it was not only a labor of love, but perhaps an obsession as well. Produced by an as-yet-unknown culture Crosby quaintly calls &quot;The Painters,&quot; these cave paintings are stunning pictographs that rival the finest rock art and cave paintings in the world. But the text is a plodding, repetitious litany of every back country foray he undertook for some 20 years to discover those neglected sites. Not until the last chapter, &quot;The Practices and Puzzles of the Painters,&quot; do we receive anything approaching speculation as to who it was that created these marvelous images. Crosby seems too interested in explaining the difficulty in reaching every cave and how disappointed he was by the woefully deteriorated condition of many of the murals. The photographs, too, tend to be similarly weighted toward the process rather than the outcome: too many of the 71 color photos are given over to man-with-mural, where mural alone might have been clearer. Without better pictures, or more thorough analysis of findings, this book becomes a sort of unsatisfying anthropological travelogue. 11 b&amp;w photos; 108 color illustrations. (Feb.)

[[w:Perl 6|Perl 6]] will separate parsing and compilation and runtime, making the virtual machine more attractive to developers looking to port other languages to the architecture.

[[w:Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] is the Perl6 runtime, and can be programmed at a low level in Parrot assembly language. Parrot exists in a limited form as of June, 2003, and a small number of languages (Jako, Cola, Basic, Forth and a subset of Perl 6) exist simply to be 'compiled' down to Parrot assembly language opcodes.

While Perl6 is being developed, the best way to stay informed about what's happening is to keep an eye on the front-page of http://www.perl.com/ and look out for articles.  As each new language-feature is being developed, it gets discussed on Perl.com and the associated mailing lists, so subscribe to some of those to see glimpses of what Perl6 will be like.

=== Obfuscated code ===

Some people claim Perl stands for 'Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister' due to the high use of meaningful punctuation characters in the language syntax.

In common with [[Programming:C|C programming language]], obfuscated code competitions are an interesting feature of the Perl culture.
Similar to obfuscated code but with a different purpose, Perl Poetry is the practice of writing poems that can actually be compiled by perl. This practice is fairly unique to Perl, due to the large number of regular English words used in the language. New poems can regularly be seen in [http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Perl%20Poetry the Perl Poetry section of perlmonks.org].

=== A Question ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
# which art form is practiced and appreciated by lawyers and perl programmers alike?
use strict; my $scupture = join(&quot;&quot;,&amp;lt;DATA&amp;gt;);$scupture =~ s/^\s*(.*?)\s*$/$1/; print unpack(&quot;A*&quot;, eval($scupture));
__DATA__
&quot;\x20\x20\x0d\x0a\x6f\x62\x66\x75\x73\x63\x61\x74\x69\x6f\x6e\x0d\x0&quot;
# Kevin Bade
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Just another Perl Hacker ===

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a one-liner perl script which displays the phrase &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot; (including the comma, and capitalization as shown).  If successful, you win the right to use it as an email signature identifying yourself as a Perl hacker.  Entries will be judged on how smart-ass the code is. Around 100 of the first JAPHs and some funky obfu Perl can be seen [http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh on CPAN].

=== Acme ===

There's always a place in Perl for odd modules, and one such place is the Acme:: namespace.  If you have a module which knows how long a piece of string is, or one which converts your perl script into an image of Che Guevara, post it here.

=== Golf ===

Perl is a very compact language. So compact, that some have even create a game around perl's terseness called perlgolf. In perlgolf, you are given a problem to solve. You must solve it in the fewest number of characters possible. A scorecard is kept, and after 18 &quot;holes&quot;, a winner is announced.

Regular expressions are tools for complex searching of text, considered one of the most powerful aspects of the Perl language.  A regular expression can be as simple as just the text you want to find, or it can include wildcards, logic, and even sub-programs.

To use regular expressions in perl, use the =~ operator to bind a variable containing your text to the regular expression:

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
  $Haystack =~ /needle/;
&lt;/source&gt;

This returns 1 if &quot;needle&quot; is contained within $HayStack, or 0 otherwise.

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
  $Haystack =~ /needle/i;    # The i means &quot;case-insensitive&quot;

  $Haystack =~ /(needle|pin)/;  # Either/Or statements

  $Haystack =~ /needle \d/;     # &quot;needle 0&quot; to &quot;needle 9&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Regular expression can also be used to modify strings. You can search and replace complex patterns by using the regex format s///

&lt;source lang=Perl&gt;
  $msg = &quot;perl is ok&quot;;
  $msg =~ s/ok/awesome/;           # search for the word &quot;ok&quot; and replace it with &quot;awesome&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
($msg is now &quot;perl is awesome&quot;)

=== Match a string ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 # Shorthand form uses // to quote the regular expression
 $Text =~ /search words/;

 # The m function allows you to use your choice of quote marks
 $Text =~ m|search words|;
 $Text =~ m{search words};
 $Text =~ m&lt;search words&gt;;
 $Text =~ m#search words#;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Split a string into parts ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 # The split function allows you to split a string wherever a regular expression is matched
 @ArrayOfParts = split( /,/, $Text);     # Splits wherever a comma is found
 @ArrayOfParts = split( /\s+/, $Text);   # Splits where whitespace is found
 @ArrayOfParts = split( /,\s*/, $Text);  # Comma followed by optional whitespace
 @ArrayOfParts = split( /\n/, $Text);    # Newline marks where to split
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Search and replace a string ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 # The s function allows you to search and replace within a string. s(ubstitute)
 $Text =~ s/search for/replace with/;
 $Text =~ s|search for|replace with|;
 $Text =~ s{search for}{replace with};

 # Putting a g (global) at the end, means it replaces all occurances and not just the first
 $Text =~ s/search for/replace with/g;

 # As with everything, putting an i (insensitive) at the end ignores the differences between
 # uppercase and lowercase.
 Use Locale;
 $Text =~ s/search for/replace with/i;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Extracting values from a string ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 # This function sets the variables $1, $2, $3 ... 
 #   to the information that it has extracted from a string.
 
 $Text =~ m/before(.*)after/;
 # So, if $Text was &quot;beforeHelloafter&quot;, $1 is now &quot;Hello&quot;
   
 $Text =~ m/bef(.*)bet(.*)aft/;
 # This time, if $Text was &quot;befOnebetTwoaft&quot;, $1 is now &quot;One&quot; and $2 is &quot;Two&quot;

 # It can also be used to extract certain kind of information.
 $Text =~ m|([^=]*)=(\d*)|;
   
 #If $Text was &quot;id=889&quot;, $1 now equals &quot;id&quot; and $2 equals 889.
&lt;/source&gt;

A huge collection of freely usable perl modules, ranging from advanced mathematics to database connectivity, networking and more, can be downloaded from a network of sites called CPAN. Most or all of the software on CPAN is also available under either the Artistic License, the GPL, or both. CPAN.pm is also the name of the perl module that downloads and installs other perl modules from one of the CPAN mirror sites; such installations can be done with interactive prompts, or can be fully automated.

[http://search.cpan.org/ Look for modules on CPAN]

== Installing modules ==

=== With ActivePerl (Windows systems) ===

From a command-line, type the command 

 ppm

This will give you a &quot;Perl Package Manager&quot; prompt, which allows you to download and install modules from the internet.  For example, to install the Time::HiRes module, type:

 search time::hires

That will give you a list of modules which match your search query.  Once you know the module is available and what its exact name is, you can install the module with:

 install Time::HiRes

=== With Perl ===

If you're using a normal version of Perl, the way to activate the package manager is this:

 perl -MCPAN -e shell;

This will load the CPAN module, and let you search for, download, install, and manage the modules on your computer the same as PPM.

=== With Perl (cpanm) ===

The Perl module cpanm (CPAN Minus) is another alternative for installing modules from the CPAN library http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.1001/lib/App/cpanminus.pm.

cpanm can be installed and used like this on a UNIX-like system:

 curl -L &quot;http://cpanmin.us&quot; &gt;cpanm
 chmod +x cpanm
 ./cpanm LWP::Bundle

One must have root privileges in order to install module in the system-wide directories, however alternatives exist such as local::lib, which allows regular users to install and use Perl modules in their home folder http://search.cpan.org/~getty/local-lib-1.006007/lib/local/lib.pm.

=== With Strawberry Perl (Windows systems) ===

Strawberry Perl also includes the CPAN module, so you can use the command above to activate the package manager.

The start menu, however, also includes a shortcut (with the name of &lt;tt&gt;&quot;CPAN Client&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;) so that you don't have to go to a command line to do so.

A number of modules are already included in Strawberry Perl, beyond what comes with a normal version of Perl, or what comes with ActivePerl, so you may wish to check if the module you want is already installed before you start the CPAN client.

== Using a module in your program ==

To incorporate a module into your program, use the Use keyword:

 use Time::HiRes;

You can supply an optional list of the functions you want to use from this module, if you're worried that some of the function names in the module are too similar to functions you're already using:

 use Time::Hires qw(time gmtime);

With that done, you can simply use the supplied functions as normal.  Most modules have example programs within their documentation, and the best way to start using a module is to copy and adapt one of the example programs.

== Finding documentation ==

The documentation for each module is installed in your documentation directory when you get a new module, or you can browse documentation on [http://search.cpan.org/ search.cpan.org] and [http://perldoc.perl.org/ perldoc.perl.org].  

=== Unix systems ===

On Unix systems, the documentation is usually installed as ''man'' pages in section 3p, so that the command below will work:

 man 3p Module::Name

&lt;code&gt;perldoc Module::Name&lt;/code&gt; will also work.

If you want documentation that is browseable in a web browser, you can install Perldoc::Server as noted below.

=== Windows systems running ActivePerl ===

Module documentation is installed as HTML files in ActivePerl. To find those files, try looking in some of the following directories:

* C:\Perl\html\lib
* C:\Perl\html\site\lib

If you're having real trouble finding the HTML documentation for a module, you may be able to read the *.pm perl file yourself for POD comments, or use the pod2html tool yourself to generate the HTML file.

=== Windows systems running Strawberry Perl ===

Strawberry Perl does not install module documentation as either manpages or html files. Instead, you can run the perldoc command to display module documentation.

 perldoc Module::Name

You can also use &lt;tt&gt;Perldoc::Server&lt;/tt&gt; to display module documentation, as illustrated below.

=== Perldoc::Server ===

The Perldoc::Server module (which can be installed via CPAN) will provide a local server that will display html files &quot;on the fly&quot; from Perl's documentation and the documentation for installed modules.  Install it, and the command

 perldoc-server

will be in your path. Run it, and then browse to http://localhost:7375/ in your web browser to see the documentation.

Note that the perldoc-server command must be running to provide the documentation using this method.

== Contributing your own modules to CPAN ==

In the event that a module you need isn't available on CPAN, the usual answer is to write the module yourself and add it to CPAN.  That way, nobody else needs to waste time creating the same functionality that you're already written.

See [http://cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_contribute_modules How to contribute modules to CPAN]

== A First Taste of Perl ==
Here's a simple program written in Perl to get us started:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

# Outputs Hello world to the screen.
 
print &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's take a look at this program line by line:

*&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/code&gt;
:On Unix systems this tells the Operating System to execute this file with the program located at &lt;tt&gt;/usr/bin/perl&lt;/tt&gt;.  This is the default Unix location for the perl interpreter, on Windows &lt;tt&gt;#!C:\Perl\bin\perl.exe &lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;#!C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe&lt;/tt&gt; (depending on whether ActivePerl or Strawberry Perl was installed) should be used instead.
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #ffeaa5; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
| '''Shebang:''' A line at the start of a file, beginning with #!, that gives instructions to the operating system.
|}

*&lt;code&gt;# Outputs ...&lt;/code&gt;
:This line is a comment - it is ignored by the perl interpreter, but is very useful. It helps you to debug and maintain your code, and explain it to other programmers.
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #ffeaa5; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
| '''Comment:''' A line of plain text ignored by the interpreter in a file of code.
|}

*&lt;code&gt;print &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;&lt;/code&gt;
:The '''print''' instruction writes whatever follows it to the screen. The &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of the ''string'' puts a new line to the screen. The semicolon at the end of the line tells the perl interpreter that the instruction is finished; you must put a semicolon at the end of '''every''' instruction in Perl code.
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #ffeaa5; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
| '''String:''' A sequence of characters used as data by a program.
|}

=== Exercises ===
{| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
|
* Change the program so it says hello to ''you''.

* Change the program so that after greeting you, it asks how you are doing, &lt;u&gt;on the next line&lt;/u&gt;. The output should look like this:
 Hello ''your_name''!
 How are you?

*Experiment with the &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; character, what happens when you take it away?    What happens if you put two in a row?

'''Remember:''' if you add another &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; instruction you will need to put a semicolon after it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Perl|Operators|Data Types}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In Perl, there are five types of variables: $calars, @rrays, %hashes, &amp;subroutines, and *typeglobs.

== Simple variables ==
Variables, called scalars, are identified with the $ character, and can contain nearly any type of data.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
$my_variable = 3;                              # integers
$my_variable = 3.1415926;                      # floating point
$my_variable = 3.402823669209384634633e+38;    # exponents
$my_variable = $another_variable + 1;          # mathematical operation
$my_variable = 'Can contain text';             # strings
$my_variable = \$another_variable;             # scalar reference
$my_variable = \@array_variable;               # array reference

print $my_variable;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Case sensitivity ===

Note that the perl interpreter is [[/case sensitivity/|case sensitive]]. This means that identifier names containing lowercase letters will be treated as being different and separate from those containing uppercase letters.

== Arrays ==
Arrays in Perl use the @ character to identify themselves.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
@my_array = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);     # numeric list
@my_array = (1 .. 10);                           # same as above
@my_array = ('John', 'Paul', 'Kanai', 'Mahenge'); # strings
@my_array = qw/John Paul Kanai Mahenge/;          # the same - one-word strings, with less typing
@my_array = qw/red blue 1 green 5/;              # mixed types
@my_array = (\@Array1, \@Array2, \@Array3);      # array of arrays

foreach my $Item (@my_array) {
    print &quot;Next item is $Item \n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However, when you deal with just one element of the array (using square brackets so it's not confused), then that element of the array is considered a scalar which takes the $ sigil:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
$my_array[0] = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

As in the C programming language, the number of the first element is 0 (although as with all things in Perl, it's possible to change this if you want). Array subscripts can also use variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
$my_array[$MyNumber] = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Associative arrays ==
Associative arrays, or &quot;hashes,&quot; use the % character to identify themselves.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
%my_hash = ('key1' =&gt; 'value1', 'key2' =&gt; 'value2');
&lt;/source&gt;

When using the &lt;tt title=&quot;fat comma&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; the left side is assumed to be quoted. For long lists, lining up keys and values aids readability.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
%my_hash = (
    key1    =&gt; 'value1',
    key2    =&gt; 'value2',
    key3    =&gt; 'value3',
);
&lt;/source&gt;

However, when you deal with just one element of the array (using braces), then that element of the array is considered a scalar and takes the $ identifier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
$my_hash{'key1'} = 'value1';
&lt;/source&gt;

Associative arrays are useful when you want to refer to the items by their names.

== Subroutines ==
Subroutines are defined by the &lt;tt&gt;sub&lt;/tt&gt; function, and used to be called using &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (using &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; is now deprecated). Here's an example program that calculates the Fibonnaci sequence:

&lt;source lang=&quot;Perl&quot;&gt;
sub fib {
    my $n = shift;
    return $n if $n &lt; 2;
    return fib( $n - 1 ) + fib( $n - 2 );
}

print fib(14);
&lt;/source&gt;

== String functions ==
===chomp===
====Action====
Removes the last characters from a string only if they're recognized as a record separator (e.g. a newline character)

====Returns====
?
====Syntax====
chomp($String = $_);

====Example====
 chomp; # removes the last character from $_ if it is a record separator
 chomp(); # (same)
 chomp($String); # removes the last character from $String if it is a record separator

====See Also====
* [[#chop|chop]] - To remove the last character from a string

=== chop === 
====Action====
Removes the last character from a string regardless
====Returns====
?
====Syntax====
chop($String = $_);

====Example====
 chop; # removes the last character from $_
 chop(); # (same)
 chop($String); # removes the last character from $String

====See Also====
* [[#chomp|chomp]] - To remove the last character from a string if it is a record seperator

Removes the last character from a string (e.g. removes the newline characters when reading from a file)

=== chr === 

 print chr(65);  # Prints a capital A

Gets an ASCII character, given it's code

=== crypt === 

 # One-way hash function
 my $HashedWord = crypt($Word, $Salt);

(See also [http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/MD5-2.03/MD5.pm MD5] )

The salt string needs only be 2 characters long, and provides a way of randomising the hash, such that the same word can produce several different hashes, if used with different values of $Salt;!

=== hex === 

 print hex(11);  # Prints B

Converts a number to hexadecimal

Other way around - converts hex to number:
print hex(11); # prints 17

you can use

print sprintf(&quot;%X&quot;,11); # Prints B

=== index === 
Search for one string within another.  (see ''rindex'' to search from end-to-start)

 $Result = index($Haystack, $Needle);
 $Result = index($Haystack, $Needle, $StartPosition);
 
 index(&quot;Some text&quot;, &quot;bleh&quot;); # Returns -1 (not found)
 index(&quot;Some text&quot;, &quot;Some&quot;); # Returns 0 (first character)
 index(&quot;Some text&quot;, &quot;text&quot;); # Returns 5 (sixth character)

The special variable $[ always gets added to the return value, but $[ is normally 0, and the manual recommends leaving it at 0.

=== lc === 

 $Lowercase = lc($String);

Converts a string to lower-case

=== lcfirst === 

Converts the first character of a string to lowercase

=== length === 

 print &quot;String is &quot; . length($String) . &quot; characters long\n&quot;;

Returns the length of a string

=== oct === 

 print oct(8);  # Prints 10

Converts a number to octal

=== ord === 
Converts a character to its number.
 
 print ord(&quot;A&quot;); # prints 65

=== pack ===
Takes a list and converts it into a string using a supplied set of rules.

 my $String = pack($Template, @ListOfNumbers);
 my $String = pack(&quot;CCCC&quot;,65,66,67,68); # Result: &quot;ABCD&quot;

$Template can be made up of:

    a	A string with arbitrary binary data, will be null padded.
    A	An ascii string, will be space padded.
    Z	A null terminated (asciz) string, will be null padded.

    b	A bit string (ascending bit order inside each byte, like vec()).
    B	A bit string (descending bit order inside each byte).
    h	A hex string (low nybble first).
    H	A hex string (high nybble first).

    c	A signed char value.
    C	An unsigned char value.  Only does bytes.  See U for Unicode.

    s	A signed short value.
    S	An unsigned short value. (Exactly 16 bits unless you use the ! suffix)

    i	A signed integer value.
    I	An unsigned integer value. (At least 32 bits wide, machine-dependant)

    l	A signed long value.
    L	An unsigned long value. (Exactly 32 bits unless you use the ! suffix)

    n	An unsigned short in &quot;network&quot; (big-endian) order.
    N	An unsigned long in &quot;network&quot; (big-endian) order.
    v	An unsigned short in &quot;VAX&quot; (little-endian) order.
    V	An unsigned long in &quot;VAX&quot; (little-endian) order. (Exactly 16 bits and 32 bits respectively)

    q	A signed quad (64-bit) value.
    Q	An unsigned quad value. (Only available if your system supports 64-bit integers and Perl has been compiled to support them)

    f	A single-precision float in the native format.
    d	A double-precision float in the native format.

    p	A pointer to a null-terminated string.
    P	A pointer to a structure (fixed-length string).

    u	A uuencoded string.
    U	A Unicode character number.  Encodes to UTF-8 internally.

    w	A BER compressed integer.  Its bytes represent an unsigned integer in base 128, most significant digit first, with as few digits as possible.  Bit eight (the high bit) is set on each byte except the last.

    x	A null byte.
    X	Back up a byte.
    @	Null fill to absolute position.  

Each letter may optionally be followed by a number giving a repeat count.

The integer types s, S, l, and L may be immediately followed by a ! suffix to signify native shorts or longs

=== reverse ===

Reverses a string (in scalar context) or a list (in list context):

 my @ReversedList = reverse(@List);

 # As commonly seen in Perl programs:
 foreach( reverse( sort( @List )))
 {
 ...
 }

 my $ReversedString = reverse($String);

 my @List = (&quot;One &quot;, &quot;two &quot;, &quot;three...&quot;);
 my $ReversedListAsString = reverse(@List); # Prints &quot;...eerht owt enO&quot;

=== rindex === 
Search for one string within another, starting at the end of the string.

 $Result = rindex($Haystack, $Needle);
 $Result = rindex($Haystack, $Needle, $StartPosition);
 
 rindex(&quot;Some text&quot;, &quot;bleh&quot;); # Returns -1 (not found)
 rindex(&quot;Some text&quot;, &quot;Some&quot;); # Returns 0 (first character)
 rindex(&quot;abbbbb&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);       # Returns 5 (first &quot;b&quot; found, when starting at the end)

=== sprintf ===

Prints a formatted string:

 my $Text = sprintf(&quot;%d / %d is %08.5f&quot;, 1, 3, 1/3); # Result: &quot;10 / 3 is 003.33333&quot;

 sprintf(&quot;Character: %c&quot;, 65); 
 sprintf(&quot;String %s&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;);
 sprintf(&quot;Signed integer: %d&quot;, 15);
 sprintf(&quot;Unsigned integer: %u&quot;, 15);
 sprintf(&quot;Unsigned int (in octal): %o&quot;, 15);
 sprintf(&quot;Unisgned int (in hex): %x&quot;, 15);      # Use %X to get upper-case output
 sprintf(&quot;Binary number: %b&quot;, 15);
 sprintf(&quot;Scientific notation: %e&quot;, 5000);      # Use %E to get upper-case output
 sprintf(&quot;Floating point number: %f&quot;, 1/3);     # 0.3333333
 sprintf(&quot;Floating point number: %g&quot;, 1/3);     # Decides between scientific and float.  %G is uppercase
 sprintf(&quot;Pointer: %p&quot;, $Variable);

Use %% to get a percent-sign.

Use %n to request the number of characters written so far, and put it into the next variable in the list.  You may want to check that user-supplied formatting rules don't contain this code.

 sprintf(&quot;%02d&quot;, $Minutes);  # Forces leading zeros to make the string 2 characters long
 sprintf(&quot;%1.5f&quot;, $Number);  # Limits the number of decimal places

=== substr === 
Return part of a string (a ''substring'')

Format:  substr ''string'' ''start-position'' ''length''

: ''start-position'' is zero-based.
: A negative number starts from the end of the string.

 $FirstLetter   = substr($Text, 0, 1);   # First letter
 $First3Letters = substr($Text, 0, 3);   # First three letters
 $Last3Letters  = substr($Text, -3);     # Last three letters

You can use '''substr''' on the left side of an assignment statement to change part of a string.  This can actually shorten or lengthen the string.

  $text = 'cat dog';
  substr ($mystring, 3, 1) = ' and ';  # $text now contains 'cat and dog'

=== uc === 

 $Uppercase = uc($String);

Converts a string to upper-case

=== ucfirst === 

Converts the first character of a string to uppercase

== Numeric functions ==

=== abs ===

=== atan2 ===

 # Converts cartesian(x,y) coordinates into an angle
 $Number = atan2($Y, $X);

=== cos ===

 # Returns the cosine of an angle (radians)
 $Number = cos($Angle);  # Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse

=== exp ===

 # Raises e to a specified power 
 $Number = exp(2); # Returns &lt;math&gt;e^2&lt;/math&gt;

 e &amp;asymp; 2.71828183 [[w:E (mathematical_constant)|more about e]]

=== hex ===

 # Interprets a string as hexidecimal, and returns its value
 $Number = hex(&quot;10&quot;); # Returns 16
 $Number = hex(&quot;0xFF&quot;); # Returns 255

=== int ===

Rounds a number towards zero, returning an integer
 $Number = int(-1.6);  # Returns -1
 $Number = int(0.9);   # Returns 0
 $Number = int(28.54); # Returns 28

=== log ===

 # Returns the natural logarithm of a number
 $Number = log(2.71828183);   # Returns 1
 $Number = exp(log($X));      # Returns $X
 $Number = log($X) / log(10); # Returns log10($X). Alternately, you can use the log10() function in the POSIX module
 $Number = log($X) / log(15); # Returns log to the base 15 of $X

=== oct ===

 # Interprets a string as octal, and returns its value
 $Number = oct(&quot;10&quot;); # Returns 8
 $Number = oct(&quot;21&quot;); # Returns 17

=== rand ===

 # Gets a random number (may automatically call srand() if that's not been done)
 $Number = rand();  # Returns a random number from 0 to 1
 $Number = int(rand(800));  # Returns a random integer from 0 to 799
 $Number = 1 + int(rand(999));  # Returns a random integer from 1 to 999

=== sin ===

 # Returns the sine of an angle (radians)
 $Number = sin($Angle);  # Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse

=== sqrt ===

 # Returns the square-root of a number
 $Number = sqrt(4);                  # Returns 2
 $Number = sqrt($X ** 2 + $Y ** 2);  # Returns the diagonal distance across a $X x $Y rectangle

 See the Math::Complex module if you need to take roots of negative numbers;

=== srand ===

 # Seeds (sets-up) the random-number generator
 srand();

Version-dependant, and older versions of Perl are not guaranteed to have a good seed value. See the Math::TrulyRandom module for more possibilities.  The current version of Perl uses the urandom device if it's available.

== List functions ==

=== grep ===

 # Returns a list of elements for which an expression is true
 @TextFiles = grep(/\.txt$/, @AllFiles);
 $NumberOfTextFiles = grep(/\.txt$/, @AllFiles);

 # Can use a block of code instead of an expression
 @TextFiles = grep({return(substr($_, -3) eq &quot;txt&quot;);}, @AllFiles);

=== join ===

 # Joins the items of a list into a single string
 $OneItemPerLine = join( &quot;\n&quot;, @List);
 $EverythingBunchedTogether = join( &quot;&quot;, @List);
 $Filename = join( &quot;/&quot;, ($Directory, $Subdirectory, $Filename));

=== map ===
 # Evaluates a block of code for each item in a list, and returns
 # a list of the results
 @UppercaseList = map(uc, @List);
 @Numbers = map {&quot;Number $_&quot;} 1..100;

=== reverse ===
 # Reverses the order of a list
 @ReversedList = reverse(@List);
 # In scalar context, concatenates the list and then reverses the string
 $ReversedString = reverse('foo','bar','baz'); # gives 'zabraboof'

=== sort ===
 # Sorts the elements in a list
 @AsciiSort = sort(@RandomList);
 @AsciiSort = sort @RandomList;
 foreach $Item (sort @RandomList)
   {...}

 # Can specify a function to decide the sort order
 @CaseInsensitiveSort = sort {uc($a) cmp uc($b)} @RandomList;
 @NumericSort = sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b} @RandomList;
 @CustomSort = sort custom_function_name @RandomList;

=== unpack ===

Unpacks a string into a list - see the templates available for the pack()
function for details

== Associative array functions == 

=== delete ===
 #Remove an element from a hash
 %h = ('a'=&gt;1, 'cow'=&gt;'moo', 'b'=&gt;2);
 delete $h{cow};
 # %h now contains ('a'=&gt;1, 'b'=&gt;2)

=== each ===
 #Return the 'next' key/value pair (in a random order)
 while (($key, $value) = each (%hash)){
    print &quot;$key =&gt; $value\n&quot;;
 }

=== exists ===
  #Tests whether or not a key exists in a hash (even if the value for that key is undef)
  if (exists $hash{$key}){
     print &quot;\%hash contains a value for key '$key'\n&quot;;
  }

=== keys ===
  #Returns a list of all keys from the hash, in same 'random' order as each
  foreach $key (keys %hash){
     print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n&quot;;
  }

=== values ===
  #Returns a list of all values from the hash, in same 'random' order as keys
  foreach $value (values %hash){
     print &quot;\%hash contains a value '$value'\n&quot;;
  }

== Input and output functions ==

=== binmode ===
=== close ===
 #closes a filehandle when it is no longer needed
 close(STDERR); #hide debugging info from the user

=== closedir ===
&lt;code&gt;
 # Close a directory open by opendir
 closedir(DIRHANDLE);
&lt;/code&gt;

=== dbmclose ===
=== dbmopen ===
=== die ===
Exits the program, printing to &quot;STDERR&quot; the first parameter and the current file and line.  Used to trap errors.
&lt;code&gt;
 die &quot;Error: $!\n&quot; unless chdir '/';
&lt;/code&gt;

=== eof ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
eof FILEHANDLE
eof()
eof
&lt;/source&gt;
This function returns true if the next read on FILEHANDLE would return end-of-file, or if FILEHANDLE is not open. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the real filehandle, or a reference to a filehandle object of some sort. An eof without an argument returns the end-of-file status for the last file read. An eof() with empty parentheses () tests the ARGV filehandle (most commonly seen as the null filehandle in &lt;&gt;). Therefore, inside a while (&lt;&gt;) loop, an eof() with parentheses will detect the end of only the last of a group of files. Use eof (without the parentheses) to test each file in a while (&lt;&gt;) loop. For example, the following code inserts dashes just before the last line of the last file: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    if (eof()) {
        print &quot;-&quot; x 30, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    print;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
On the other hand, this script resets line numbering on each input file: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
# reset line numbering on each input file
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    next if /^\s*#/;        # skip comments
    print &quot;$.\t$_&quot;;
} continue {
    close ARGV if eof;      # Not eof()!
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Like &quot;$&quot; in a sed program, eof tends to show up in line number ranges. Here's a script that prints lines from /pattern/ to end of each input file: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    print if /pattern/ .. eof;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, the flip-flop operator (..) evaluates the pattern match for each line. Until the pattern matches, the operator returns false. When it finally matches, the operator starts returning true, causing the lines to be printed. When the eof operator finally returns true (at the end of the file being examined), the flip-flop operator resets, and starts returning false again for the next file in @ARGV

 rename $OldFile, $NewFile or die(&quot;Couldn't move file&quot;);

May work differently on non-*nix operating systems, and possibly not at all when moving between different filesystems.  See [[File::Copy]] for more complicated file operations.

=== rmdir ===
 rmdir $Filename || die(&quot;Couldn't remove directory&quot;);

=== stat ===
 @FileStatistics = stat($Filename); 

 $DeviceNum    = $FileStatistics[0]; # device number of filesystem
 $Inode        = $FileStatistics[1]; # inode number
 $FileMode     = $FileStatistics[2]; # (type and permissions)

 $ModifyTime   = $FileStatistics[9];
 $ChangeTime   = $FileStatistics[10];
 $BlockSize    = $FileStatistics[11];
 $NumBlocks    = $FileStatistics[12];

=== symlink ===

 # Creates a new filename symbolically linked to the old filename
 symlink($OldFilename, $NewFilename);
 symlink($OldFilename, $NewFilename) || die(&quot;Couldn't create symlink&quot;);
 eval(symlink($OldFilename, $NewFilename));

=== umask ===

 # Sets or returns the ''umask'' for the process.
 my $UMask = umask();
 umask(0000); # This process can create any type of files
 umask(0001); # This process can't create world-readable files
 umask(0444); # This process can't create executable files

=== unlink ===

 # Deletes a file
 unlink $Filename;
 unlink $Filename || die(&quot;Couldn't delete file&quot;);
 unlink $File1, $File2, $File3;
 (unlink($File1, $File2, $File3) == 3) || die(&quot;Couldn't delete files&quot;);

=== utime ===

 # Updates the modification times of a list of files
 my $AccessTime = time();
 my $ModificationTime = time();

 utime($AccessTime, $ModificationTime, $Filename);
 my $NumFilesChanged = utime($AccessTime, $ModificationTime, $File1, $File2, $File3);

== Program functions ==

=== caller ===
Returns information about the current function call stack.  In scalar context, returns only the name of the package from where the current subroutine was called.  In list context, returns the package, filename, and line number.  In list context with a numeric argument passed, returns several pieces of information (see below).  The argument represents how many levels in the call stack to go back.

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 foo();
 sub foo {
    $package = caller; #returns 'main'
    ($package, $filename, $line) = caller; #returns 'main', the file name, and 3
    # Line below returns all 10 pieces of info. (Descriptions self-explanatory from variable names)
    ($package, $filename, $line, $subroutine, $hasargs, $wantarray, $evaltext, $is_require, $hints, $bitmask) =
       caller(0); 
  }

=== import ===
There is no actual 'import' function.  Rather, it is a convention when writing a module to create a subroutine named 'import' which populates the current namespace with that module's needed variables and/or methods.

The standard 'Exporter' module provides an import method if your class has it as a base class.

=== package ===
Declares all lines that follow (until EOF or the next package statement) to belong to the given package's namespace.
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 $x = 5;  #sets $main::x
 
 package Foo;
 $x = 5;  #sets $Foo::x
 sub bar { #defines &amp;Foo::bar
    print &quot;hello world&quot;;
 }
 
 package Temp;
 $x = 5; #sets $Temp::x

=== require === 

includes the specified module's code into the current program.  The module can be specified either with an absolute or relative path, or with a bareword.  If a bareword is given, a '.pm' extention is added, and :: is replaced with the current operating system's path seperator:

 require Foo::Bar;
 #identical to:
 require 'Foo/Bar.pm';

=== use ===

Requires and imports the given module or pragma, at compile time.  The line 

 use Foo qw/bar baz/;

is identical to:

 BEGIN {
    require Foo;
    import Foo qw/bar baz/;
 }

== Misc functions ==

=== defined ===
 #returns true if argument is not undef
 $x = 0;
 print &quot;X defined\n&quot; if defined $x; #prints
 print &quot;Y defined\n&quot; if defined $y; #does not print
 
=== dump ===
=== eval ===
 eval('$a=30;$b=40;');
 print $a,$b;

=== formline ===
=== local ===
 #assigns temporary value to global variable for duration of lexical scope
 $x = 5;
 print &quot;x = $x\n&quot;; # 5
 {
   local $x = 10;
   print &quot;x = $x\n&quot;; # 10
 }
 print &quot;x = $x\n&quot;; # 5

=== my ===
 #creates new lexical (ie, not global) variable
 $x = 5;  #refers to $main::x
 {
   my $x = 10;
   print &quot;x = $x\n&quot;; # the lexical - 10
   print &quot;main's x = $main::x\n&quot; # the global - 5
 }
 print &quot;x = $x\n&quot;;  #the global, because no lexical in scope - 5

=== reset ===
 #resets hash's internal pointer, to affect lists returned by each
 while ($k, $v = each %h){
   print &quot;$k = $v\n&quot;;
   last if ($i++ == 2);
 }
 #if another each done here, $k,$v will pick up where they left off.
 reset %h
 #now each will restart from the beginning.

=== scalar ===
 #forces scalar context on an array
 @sizes = (scalar @foo, scalar @bar);
 #creates a list of the sizes of @foo and @bar, rather than the elements in @foo and @bar

=== undef ===
 #undefines an existing variable
 $x = 5;
 undef $x;
 print &quot;x = $x\n&quot; if defined $x; #does not print

=== wantarray ===
 #returns 'true', 'false', or undef if function that called it was called in list, scalar, or void context, respectively.
 sub fctn {
    my @vals = (5..10);
    if (wantarray) {
       return @vals;
    } elsif (defined wantarray) {
       return $vals[0];
    } else {
       warn &quot;Warning!  fctn() called in void context!\n&quot;;
    }
 }

== Processes ==

=== alarm ===
=== exec ===
=== fork ===
 #clones the current process, returning 0 if clone, and the process id of the clone if the parent
 my $pid = fork();
 if ($pid == 0) {
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;print &quot;I am a copy of the original\n&quot;;
 } elsif ($pid == -1)  {
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;print &quot;I can't create a clone for some reason!\n&quot;;
 } else {

 $DayOfYear  = $TimeParts[7]; # 1-366

=== localtime ===
Converts a timestamp to local time

 @TimeParts = localtime(); 
 @TimeParts = localtime($Time); 

 $Seconds    = $TimeParts[0]; # 0-59 
 $Minutes    = $TimeParts[1]; # 0-59

 $DayOfYear  = $TimeParts[7]; # 1-366

=== time ===
 $Time = time();

Returns number of seconds since an epoch (which is system-dependant, but may be Jan 1 1970)

See also [[../Time::Hires/]]

=== times ===

 @CPUTimes = times();
 $UserTimeForProcess    = $CPUTimes[0];
 $SystemTimeForProcess  = $CPUTimes[1];
 $UserTimeForChildren   = $CPUTimes[2];
 $SystemTimeForChildren = $CPUTimes[3];

== Functions that reverse each other ==

Some functions in perl reverse or otherwise cancel the effect of each other, so running a string through both of them will produce the same output as the input, for example

 print ord(chr(1));

will echo &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; to standard output,

&lt;code&gt;[[#ord|ord()]]&lt;/code&gt; will convert a character to its number in the character set, while &lt;code&gt;[[#chr|chr()]]&lt;/code&gt; will convert a number to its corresponding character, therefore 

in the same way that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2} = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}^2 = x&lt;/math&gt; in [[w:Mathematics|Mathematics]] (assuming x is non-negative), &lt;code&gt;ord(chr(1)) = 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chr(ord(1)) = 1&lt;/code&gt; in Perl.

List of functions that reverse each other:

*&lt;code&gt;[[#lc|lc()]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[#uc|uc()]]&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;[[#lcfirst|lcfirst()]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[#ucfirst|ucfirst()]]&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;[[#ord|ord()]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[#chr|chr()]]&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;[[#join|join()]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[#split|split()]]&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;[[#push|push()]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[#pop|pop()]]&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;[[#unshift|unshift()]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[#shift|shift()]]&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==On Merging==
I do not think that the XHTML section of the XML Wikibook is extensive enough (or indeed capable of being extensive enough) to cover XHTML sufficiently.  The section on media types, for example, does not do the subject justice.  There is no mention whatsoever of &lt;code&gt;application/xml&lt;/code&gt; dispite the fact that it is the most cross compatible media type nor is there any mention of the pitfalls of serving XHTML as HTML.  Conversely, our section on media types includes a more comprehensive overview of the pros and cons of each and even includes a table which illustrates the how each layout engine interprets each media type.  This is the kind of depth that a stand-alone XHTML book can reach with other XHTML subjects like semantic layouts, modularization, DTDs, HTML conversion, deprecated elements, namespaces, and syntax.

Yes the XML module is better written and organized, and yes, it does do a good job giving an overview of what XHTML is, but that doesn't mean that we can't match its quality while offering a more complete steadily-paced tutorial.  In summation, I vote for sufficiency over efficiency.

==Untitled==
You don't get XHTML by just putting the right doctype in a HTML document and make sure it's formatted according XML standards [This is not true: an XHTML document is an XHTML document regardless of what common browsers do with it - RFC 2854 makes it clear that some XHTML documents can be served as text/html]. If the server sends it as text/html, it is  still interpreted as HTML. The contenttype should be &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;. And if you use that, many browser are in trouble.

http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml

Try this in IE6: http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/xhtml-style-script/examples/example-6.xhtml (one of the rare real XHTML pages on the web).

Since about 90% of the internet users still uses IE as a browser, it is not realistic to create real XHTML webpages for common purpose. And it's going to be that way for a couple of years. If you search on google for this webpage (for example this page: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Example+6+-+XHTML+1.0+Strict+as+application%2Fxhtml%2Bxml&amp;btnG=Search), then you'll see the google says &quot;File Format: Unrecognized&quot;.


Technically correct but as both IE6 (and IE5?) and Firefox display XHTML sent as text/html fine, why create pages using older standards which teach bad practices just so you can be correct with the contenttype?


== Organization is a bit off ==

As of now, I just don't like how the page here is set up. It seems like we're diving into the core XHTML tech too soon and not giving a real introduction to it. We just have a short synopsis, and ''bam!'' we've put tags and elements before their faces. Here's how I'd like to see it:

*Introduction to XHTML
**Purpose
**History
**Differences from HTML /* jump here if they already know HTML and just want a diff */
*Syntax
**How XML Works /* if they want to understand XHTML, first they have to get XML */
**Basic Tags /* does this belong here? -- html, head, title, body, p, br */
*Your First XHTML Document
**Code Listing /* not a real section, just the listing */
**Understanding the Elements
*Links and the &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; Attribute

''etc.''

This way, I think there'll be less of a learning curve. (Oh, and the &lt;tt&gt;application/xhtml+xml&lt;/tt&gt; thing too.) &lt;small&gt;[ [[User:Alerante|alerante]] | [[User_talk:Alerante|&amp;#x201c;&amp;#x201d;]] 13:13, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC) ]&lt;/small&gt;

== XHTML in IE is broken, so we should create another page. ==

XHTML in IE is broken.

XHTML in Mozilla and Firefox is properly rendered as XHTML. Just 'View info' to see that it works.

Therefore, instead of changing this XHTML page to deal with IE's quirky interpretation of XHTML.

I propose we have a second page dealing with IE's quirks regarding XHTML.

If I write an article about unleaded gasoline, but your car does not function with unleaded gasoline, then we should write an article about your car. We should NOT delete a page which correctly describes unleaded gasoline.

:IE quirks are definitely outside the scope of an article on standardized XHTML.  There are a few problems here, honestly.  One is that IE is arguably bad/terrible/horrendous software and the other is that W3C's standards are arguably byzantine and unnecessarily complicated.  However, if the focus of this wikibook is XHTML, it should adhere to XHTML standards which are established by W3C, not by Microsoft.  If the book is not about standardized XHTML, don't call it a book on standardized XHTML.  I think this is a question of scope, not protocol.  --banzaimonkey

== Cascading Style Sheets ==

If we're going to do a proper wikibook on XHTML, I suspect that it will need a sister volume on [[CSS Programming| Cascading Style Sheets]]. Right now, it's hideously under-developed.

== web hosts to practice with ==

Learning all the tags and viewing local files with a web browser is nice and everything, but the whole point is to put stuff on the Internet.

I think it would be nice to explain how to get these &quot;.html&quot; files from your personal computer onto the Internet.

Is there some other wikibook that talks about uploading to a web server ?

There are lots of places to get free web hosting; would it be appropriate to list a few dozen in this wikibook? (Is there a more appropriate wikibook?)

== Merging this page with XHTML (XML) ==

As the note describes at the beginning of the page, I think a merging is necessary.

However, I'd have to say, ''overwhelmingly'', that the [[XHTML (XML)]] page is '''much much better'''. It is far more thorough and descriptive. Perhaps what needs to be done is to look this over and compare it with the other page, finding any bits worthy of inclusion that cannot be found at [[XHTML (XML)]] and redirect this sucker over.

EDIT: 4/21/06
XML and XHTML are actually 2 different things. XML is used by such programs as MSN Messenger to store logs, while XHTML is more of an HTML encoding standard than an entirely different language. As such, merging this page wouldn't do much good, unless you want to link it through there.

== Confusion betwen tags, elements and element types ==

This tutorial uses the word &quot;tag&quot; where it should read &quot;element&quot; or &quot;element type&quot; instead.  One example is stating that XHTML documents are enclosed in an &lt;html&gt; tag.  This is not the case.

== Bad practices ==

I think it's rather bad that this module teaches bad practices. I've only read the first page, but I noticed this:
* Links like &quot;click &lt;a&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&quot; isn't any good at all. Rather than &quot;Click &lt;a&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to go to Wikibooks.org&quot;, the module should rather say &quot;Go to &lt;a&gt;Wikibooks.org&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.
* Missing alt-text when introducing &lt;img /&gt;. One'd better get it right from the beginning!

== &quot;This document, although it works in 99% of XHTML browsers, isn't actually valid because it lacks a doctype.&quot; ==

99%? Where was this statistic pulled from? The same place that the rabbit was?

== Mozilla Standards Compliance ==

I changed &quot;completely&quot; standards compliant, to &quot;mostly&quot; standards compliant. Mozilla is good, but it's not the best. Let's keep things objective here ;-).


[[User:59.92.142.69|59.92.142.69]] 13:58, 28 February 2006 (UTC)-Rahul.

:While on the subject of objectivity, why are &quot;we&quot; reccomending only Mozilla Firefox?  Are not there other browsers which properly render XHTML?  Don't they deserve at least a mention?

== In XHTML 1.0 Strict You SHOULD NOT use the 'b' and 'i' element ==

Please, correct markup tags, 'b' and 'i' have be retired of your mental-dictionary.

*b was tranformed to 'strong'
*i was transformed to 'em'

== Tags and Elements ==

The &quot;Tags and Elements&quot; section should be rewritten. Elements are semantic structuring units; a valid XHTML document is composed of a hierarchy of elements conforming to an XHTML DTD. Tags are the syntax used to identify elements. An element has a name identifying its type, a start tag, possibly optional attributes, possibly optional content, and an end tag. The DTD specifies, for each element type, which attributes are allowed and required, and the content that is allowed. Attributes are specified in the start tag. An element with no content may start and end with the same tag (e.g. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;). (Although for browser compatibility some elements like script should have explicit start and end tags.)


== Adding Some Pages ==
I added some pages, of course they a bit under developed but give it time. I agree that the page needs some organisation. I'll attempted this. Also some pictures would be nice (coding etc). --[[User:Grich|Grich]] 01:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

== This book ==

I think that this book needs a complete re-write. It is written as if it expects the reader to be a professional in HTML. This book has to assume that the reader has never even heard of HTML and does not have any knowledge of this web stuff what-so-ever. --[[User:S.Örvarr.S|S.Örvarr.S]] 00:31, 26 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Light==
Light is that range of electromagnetic energy that is visible to the human eye, the visible colors.
The optical radiation includes not only the visible range, but a broader range of invisible electromagnetic radiation that 
could be influenced in its radiation behavior in a similar way as the visible radiation, but needs often other transmitters or receivers for this radiation.
Dependant on the kind of experimental question light - optical radiation behaves as a wave or a particle named lightwave or
photon.
The birth or death of photons needs electrons - electromagnetic charges, that change their energy.


The speed of light is fastest in the vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;c\approx 3\cdot 10^8 \mbox{ m s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
In a wave we have to distinguish between the speed of transport of energy or the speed of the transport of on phase state
of a wave of a defined frequency. In vacuum the speed of waves of any photon energy - wavelength is the same, but the transmission speed through material is dependent on wavelength - photon energy. 
At the time the measurement of the speed of light in vacuum reached the uncertainty of the unit of length, the meter, this basic unit got in 1960  a new definition, based on the unit of time. Taking the best known measurement values it was defined without any uncertainties of length, that the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. For this reason the only uncertainty in the speed of light is the uncertainty of the realization of the unit of time, the second. (If you like to get the standard of length, cooperate with the watchmaker).
  
However, when electromagnetic radiation enters a medium with refractive index, n, its speed would become&lt;br&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;c_n=\frac{c}{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in the medium.
===Refraction===
Refraction occurs when light travels from one medium into another (i.e. from air into water). Refraction is the changing of direction of light due to the changing speed of light. Refraction occurs toward the normal when light travels from a medium into a denser medium. Example when light travels from air into a block of glass, light is refracted towards the normal. The ratio between the sine of the angle of the incident ray and sine of the angle of the refracted ray is the same as the ratios of the indexes of refraction.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_i}{\sin\theta_r} = \frac{n_r}{n_i} \quad \text{or} \quad n_i\sin\theta_i = n_r\sin\theta_r\ &lt;/math&gt;}} 

This is known as Snell's Law - an easy way to remember this is that 'Snell' is 'lens' backwards.

==Mirrors and lenses==
===Focal length===

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{d_i} + \frac {1}{d_o} = \frac {1}{f} &lt;/math&gt;}}
*''f'' is the focal length.

*Virtual Network Computing (VNC) can be used to access your computer from anywhere if it's connected to the Internet and you know its IP address (use &lt;tt&gt;ifconfig&lt;/tt&gt;).  vnc-java can automatically create a webpage with a Java applet that eliminates the need for a VNC client.  Try using x11-vnc
*for remote X you can also use simply X with xhost as X is a network protcol, or you can do X forwarding with ssh.
*WINE will often run your old Windows programs very well.  It's hit and miss, but often more complex, graphics-heavy applications will work better than specifically integrated Windows apps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Standard diagonal shifting of C major chord.png|right|thumb|In standard tuning, the C-major chord has three shapes because of the irregular major-third between the G- and B-strings. Among alternative tunings, regular tunings have the same shape for chords everywhere on the fretboard.]]

Many guitar players use  alternate tunings, which differ from standard tuning. The use of alternate tunings (non-standard tunings) are found throughout the history of the classical guitar and are a major factor in the playing of blues slide guitar. Many alternate tunings involve downtuning (&quot;dropping&quot;) strings. 

==Dropped tunings==
===Dropped D (DADGBE)===

The most common alternate tuning is the dropped D (or &quot;drop D&quot;) tuning. The lower E string is tuned down to a D. This tuning allows one to play [[Guitar/Double-stops and Power Chords|power chords]] on the fourth, fifth and sixth strings with only one finger, and of course allows for lower bass notes. Used commonly in heavy metal, but also in nearly every other form of guitar music.

Waylon Jennings used this frequently, even dropping to D with the use of a scruggs banjo tuner on his famous telecaster in the middle of a song.

===Drop C tuning CGCFAD===

This progressive tuning is used in metal but often used by bands who stick with 6 string guitars to achieve an extra deep tone. Bands such as CydeDish, Deftones, System of a Down, KSE, August Burns Red and As I Lay Dying.

===Drop B (BEBEF#B)===

Alternatively, you can tune to BF#BEG#C#. This tuning is mostly used by nu-metal bands like Slipknot, many deathcore bands, and some death metal bands.

===Double dropped D (DADGBD)===

Similar to Dropped D above, for this tuning just drop both 'E' strings a full tone. Neil Young often tunes his guitars this way.

==Regular tunings==
[[File:Augmented chord in the chromatic circle.png|left|thumb|The major-thirds tuning G#-C-E-G#-C-E repeats its three open-notes in the higher octave after three strings.]]
[[Image:Diagonal shift of C-major chord in major-thirds tuning.png|right|thumb|page=15|Chords can be shifted diagonally in major-thirds tuning and other regular tunings.]]
[[Image:Chords in major-thirds tuning C, D, G, minor, major, dominant seventh.png|thumb|left|Minor, major, and seventh chords (''C, D, G''): In major-thirds tuning, major and minor chords can be played with two fingers on two consecutive frets. The chords have the same shape, unlike the chords of standard tuning.]]
{{main|w:Regular tunings}}

Among alternative guitar-tunings, regular&amp;nbsp;tunings have equal musical-intervals between the paired notes of their successive open-strings. Regular tunings simplify the learning of the fretboard of the guitar and of chords by beginning students. Regular tunings also facilitate improvisation by advanced guitarists.

Guitar&amp;nbsp;tunings assign pitches to the open&amp;nbsp;strings of guitars.  Tunings can be described by the particular pitches that are denoted by notes in Western music. By convention, the notes are ordered from lowest to highest. The ''standard tuning'' defines the string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E. Between the open-strings of the standard tuning are three perfect-fourths (E-A, A-D, D-G), then the major third G-B, and the fourth perfect-fourth B-E.

In contrast, regular tunings have constant intervals between their successive open-strings:
* 4 semitones (major third): Major-thirds tuning,
* 5 semitones (perfect fourth): All-fourths tuning,
* 6 semitones (augmented fourth, tritone, or diminished fifth): Augmented-fourths tuning,
* 7 semitones (perfect fifth): All-fifths tuning

For the regular tunings, chords may be moved ''diagonally'' around the fretboard, indeed ''vertically'' for the repetitive regular tunings (minor thirds, major thirds, and augmented fourths). Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified. On the other hand, some conventional chords are easier to play in standard tuning than in regular tuning.

===Major thirds tuning===
[[Image:Shift C-major chord three strings in major thirds tuning on six-string guitar.png|left|thumb|page=14|Chords can be translated vertically by three strings, because major-thirds tuning repeats itself (at a higher octave). Again, the chords have the same shape, unlike the chords of standard tuning.]]
[[Image:First and second inversions of C-major chord on six-string guitar with major-thirds tuning.png|right|thumb|alt=The C major chord and its first and second inversions. In the first inversion, the C note has been raised 3 strings on the same fret. In the second inversion, both the C note and the E note have been raised 3 strings on the same fret.|Chords are inverted by shifting notes three strings ''on the same fret''.
{{main|w:Major thirds tuning}}

Major-thirds tuning was introduced by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt in 1964. All of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, the standard guitar-tuning has one major-third amid four perfect-fourths.

Major-thirds tuning reduces the extensions of the little and index fingers (&quot;hand stretching&quot;). Major and minor chords are played on two successive frets, and so require only two fingers; other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on three successive frets. For each regular tuning,  chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and that simplifies advanced players' improvisation. In contrast, chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords. There are separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings. Major-thirds tuning repeats its octave after every two strings, which again simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation; Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.

===All fourths tuning===
[[File:C7 chord and alternative voicing for EADG (standard and all-fourths) tuning for six string guitar.png|thumb|left|In ''all-fourths'' and standard tuning, the C7 chord has notes on frets 3-8; Covering six frets is difficult, and so C7 is rarely played but &quot;alternative voicing&quot; are substituted instead. In ''major-thirds'' tuning, all seventh-chords can be played on three consecutive frets.]]
[[File:All fourths tuning in the chromatic circle.png|right|thumb|The consecutive notes of all-fourths tuning are spaced apart by five semi-tones on the chromatic circle.]]
[[Image:All fourths tuning.png|thumb|right|All fourths tuning.]]
{{main|w:All fourths tuning}}

:E-A-d-g-c'-f'
This tuning is like that of the lowest four strings in standard tuning. Consequently, of all the regular tunings, it is the closest approximation to standard tuning, and thus it best allows the transfer of a knowledge of chords from standard tuning to a regular tuning. Jazz musician Stanley Jordan plays guitar in all-fourths tuning; he has stated that all-fourths tuning &quot;simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical&quot;. Contemporary players are also moving to fourths tuning, noted players include Alex Hutchings and Tom Quayle.

:Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-B-E
A less commonly used version of fourths tuning is retaining the regular tuning on the first and second strings (E and B) and lowering the other strings by a semitone. This version can make playing classical pieces more accessible.

===Augmented fourths tuning===

===All fifths tuning===

====New Standard Tuning (CGDAEG)====


[[Image:New standard tuning.png|thumb|'''New standard tuning'''. All perfect fifths (C-G-D-A-E) plus a minor third (E-G).]]
[[Image:C major chord in new standard tuning.png|thumb|left|C major chord in new standard tuning {{audio|C major chord in new standard tuning.mid|Play}}.]]
[[Image:D major chord in new standard tuning.png|thumb|D major chord in new standard tuning {{audio|D major chord in new standard tuning.mid|Play}}.]]
[[Image:Open fifths on D in new standard tuning.png|thumb|left|[[w:open fifth|Open fifths]] on D in new standard tuning {{audio|Open fifths on D in new standard tuning.mid|Play}}.]]

The tuning, invented and introduced by [[w:|Robert Fripp]] of King Crimson, is: C(6th) - G(5th) - D(4th) - A(3rd) - E(2nd) - G(1st).

Basically this tuning is efficient because it utilizes the tuning that is common is a cello (CGDA) , violin, and mandolin (both GDAE), in which it is in fifth, from a low C. The second string is a fourth up from the B to an E, and the first string is a minor third up from the E to a G.

Since the lowest five strings are tuned in fifths, typical fingerings for chords and scales used on the violin, cello, and mandolin are applicable here. The minor third between the top strings allow denser chords in the high range of the scale, and easier access to some elementary chord tones (typically the thirteenth for chords with the root note on the sixth string, and the ninth and flat ninth for chords with the root note on the fifth string, see chord). NST has a greater range than the Old Standard Tuning, approximately a perfect fifth (a major third lower and a minor third higher).

Scales across two strings in NST also line up nicely into coherent tetrachords or four-note patterns that have a visually rational relationship (whole and half-tone relationships have a remarkable symmetry that can be easier to learn than the OST whose intervals from 6 to 1 have the (inconsistent) major third thrown in the middle of the scale.

==Open tunings==


===Open A (EAC#EAE)===
Alternatively you could tune the guitar to EAC#AC#E

===&quot;Slide&quot; Open A (EAEAC#E)===

This tuning is identical to Open G tuning but with every string raised one step, or two frets

===Open C (CGCGCE)===

Used mostly by Devin Townsend and Strapping Young Lad.

===Open D (DADF#AD)===

Open D, like all open tunings, produces a major chord (in this case, D major) when all strings are strummed. Drop the sixth, first, and second strings down two semitones, and the third string one semitone.  It is also called &quot;DAD-fad&quot; after its notes.

Uses the same chord shapes as Open E but is easier on a guitar neck as the strings are detuned lessening the tension.

Open D is a common tuning for folk, blues, and slide guitar. A variation of this tuning is open d minor. Open D minor is tuned DADFAD, meaning the only change is that the F# is tuned down to an F. 

====Chord shapes====

Here are some handy chord shapes:
G/D: (020120)
Em7/D: (022120)

===Open E (EBEG#BE)===

Used by Cat Stevens and a popular choice for slide guitarists. Strumming in the open position yields a Emajor chord. You can easily play any chord by barring across the neck at different fret positions. This does however have some disadvantages; mainly that it is slightly more difficult to play minor chords. Some artists overcome this by tuning to EBEGBE. This allows both minor and major chords to be played easily.  Because tightening the strings more than is intended can break the strings or put unneeded stress on the neck, many players opt to tune in Open D and put a capo on the second fret; the result is the same.

===Open C6 (CACGCE)===

This tuning is rarely used. It has been used by Jimmy Page on &quot;Bron-Y-Aur&quot; and &quot;Poor Tom&quot;.

===Open G (DGDGBD)===

This is sometimes referred to as &quot;Spanish Tuning&quot;, popular with slide guitarists.  Tune the 1st and 6th strings down to D, and the 5th string to G.

Keith Richards uses this tuning extensively after 1968. (See Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Women, Start Me Up) He also removes the bottom 1st string because the root of the chord is on the 5th string in Open G.

==Miscellaneous tunings==

===DADGAD===

DADGAD (pronounced as a word: &quot;DAD-gad&quot;), one of the most versatile tunings, is named after the tuning of its strings. The sixth, second, and first strings are dropped two semitones to D, A, and D. Strumming all the strings open forms a Dsus4 chord; fretting the second fret of the third string (or muting the third string) produces a D5 chord, or D power chord. Most songs for DADGAD are in D major, or in G major with a capo at the fifth fret.

===DADADD===
This is essentially one huge power chord. Each string neatly divides the scale in half and it is easy to make simple patterns then repeat them anywhere on the fretboard.

===Standard E-flat (EbAbDbGbBbeb)===

In this tuning, each string is tuned down a half step, or one fret. This is a popular tuning throughout the history of blues and rock, and many modern bands perform with it.  Stevie Ray Vaughn frequently used this tuning with heavier strings to get a full, rich tone.

===Standard D (DGCFAD) ===
Made popular by death metal band Death. Common in metal today.

Maybe it's perfectly okay to copy [http://www.museweb.com/ag/tunings/fm_tunings.html Alternate Tuning Guide for Contemporary Folk Music] and place it under the GFDL? Well, I'm gonna ask the author now... [[User:Akagu|Akagu]] 17:49, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Nice to see other people starting to work on this book. :) I'd prefer not to let editing get out of hand because I'm still trying to stabilize the layout and structure of the book...but I don't mind, and of course I have no control over it even if I did. ;)

I wouldn't just copy a source here...I think something like that might belong more in Wikipedia, but I'm not sure. Parts of sources might be a different story.

--[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 18:39, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Fb==
I'm trying to find an Fb on my piano that I can tune to...  Any ideas? (Idea: Fb=E)

:You should be tuning to F#, not Fb, for Drop B tuning. Fb is the same a E and E# is the same as F, so if you're tuning to E(Fb), that's actually the 5th of a Drop A tuning(Nile is a good example of this.) So remember, tune to F#, not Fb, that'll set you back a full step on all strings. Now if you tune the 5th string to F and tune other strings to it to the 4th interval, you'll get C Standard tuning(Black Dahlia Murder uses this tuning.) Got any questions about tuning, holla back at skogenburzum@yahoo.com

== Alright, I give up.  ==

I've been trying fruitlessly to insert the table I fabricated into the article, but it seems to want to put the text where I direct it to place it, but shove the table way down below the external links. I'd be grateful if anyone can make the software understand that the two go together. Also, sorry for the inconvenience I've caused; don't kill me, I am only a noob. I'll post the table directly below this message. Thanks.

== How round was my roti? ==

Every Indian woman I've ever known (and some men) have said that achievement of a perfectly round roti is part of every domestic goddess's repertoire.

Someone might want to add the to this page that chapati is also a staple of many East African diets.  It is undoubtedly part of the Southeast Asian influence on this area of East Africa because of the slave trade that extended through this corridor, but it has become a very common part of the diet there as well.  There are many women who derive their income from &quot;chai and chapati&quot; trades out of their homes or out of small shacks alongside the road.  Many a village in Tanzania has at least a couple of mamas whom everyone knows they can get chapati throughout the day.  It is called chapati in the Swahili language as well.  I think this would be an appropriate inclusion in the article, but do not know how to add it myself. 
-jl

So I am Indian and most certainly a chapati is not the same thing as a roti. To the best of my knowledge, chapatis are more common in Western India, in the Maharashtra-Gujarat-Karnataka region (this is where I am from), while rotis are common in North India and Pakistan. The preparation methods of chapatis and rotis differ and so does their taste. I will post recipes asap, but in the mean time, if someone else has them, please post! - Sarang (my email is my name at media.mit.edu)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hydroboration basics==
By reacting an alkene with borane, a useful reaction intermediate called an organoborane can be formed. An organoborane can be oxidized to form a terminal alcohol, or it can be protonated to form an alkane. 

(Basic examples of reduction and protonolysis here)

==History==
Hydroboration reactions were developed by Herbert C. Brown during his research at Purdue University. It earned him the 1979 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (along with Georg Wittig) because of the practical applications to synthesis, namely pharmaceuticals.

{{wikipedia|Herbert Brown}}

==Formation of borane reagents==
Borane is not stable, it must be generated in situ from a borohydride salt (eg NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) at the time of organoborane formation. Diborane exists in equilibrium with borane.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Diborane_formation.png|Formation of diborane (and borane) from   sodium borohydride]]&lt;br&gt;''Formation of diborane (and borane) from sodium borohydride''&lt;/center&gt;

==Hydroboration/Protonolysis==
After one has formed an organoborane, it can be be reacted with an organic acid to obtain an alkane. The two hydrogens are added with syn stereospecificity

==Hydroboration/Oxidation==
Organoboranes can be oxidized in a basic peroxide solution to form alcohols. The alcohol that is formed is the opposite product that would be formed by oxymercuration or hydration. The hydrogen and hydroxide groups add syn to each other.

==Regiochemistry of products==
Boration reactions generate ''anti-Markovnikov'' products because hydrogen adds second as a hydride nucleophile. (In most other reactions, hydrogen usually adds first as an electrophile.) The borane adds first, which is an honor usually reserved for the strongly electrophilic proton.

Best Chinese Names (B217) 
Unlike names in other languages, Chinese names are made up of individual characters, used singly or strung together. Best Chinese Names aims to help English-speakers select good Chinese names by providing various methods of choosing names. For instance, names may be chosen to express the parents' expectations for the future of the child, to commemorate a significant event, or to mark the time of the baby's birth. The names, thus chosen, fit the character of the individual, sound pleasing, and are easier to remember. This book provides hundreds of names, with sections for both male and female babies, suggestions on methods of naming a baby, and a list of English names compatible with Chinese names. Useful not only for new parents but also teachers and students who need to select Chinese names.

New Slang of China (BLD003) 
This dictionary of New Slang of China contains nearly 1300 entries of the most popular and widely used slang that has emerged in recent years. It includes spoken language, colloquial expressions, jargon, argot, cant, influential and representative dialects and local expressions. Among them are many newly created words, old words with new definitions and foreign words. Through this dictionary you can learn more new and popular words used by common people, enlarge vocabulary, master word usage and expressions and make your conversation more interesting and appealing. Each slang is explained with Pinyin, Chinese characters and English, as well as examples how to use the slang. Xiaoning says this is, “A great book for anyone who wants to learn the real Chinese daily spoken language… recommended for anyone who travels in China and wants to speak Chinese as the Chinese do!”
Here is a review from one of our customers Elizabeth Yu: &quot;While studying Chinese as a young college student in New York City it was always a chore to memorize vocabulary words and grammar, yet it was great fun to learn slang. Slang as a colloquial spoken language is vividly flavored with local color. It is informal, direct and often humorous. It is pleasing to see that some of the most recent Chinese slang has now been compiled into a book. Understanding these phrases and expressions will enable you to more fully savor the richness and excellence of the Chinese language and culture.The words in this reference book are arranged alphabetically in pinyin. Following each word or words is a sentence in simplified Chinese characters and English showing how the words are used in everyday language. Whether you are planning a trip to China or would just like to enrich your own knowledge of Chinese this is a useful book to have.&quot;

the most comprehensive Chinese to English dictionary around to the new ABC Comprehensive Dictionary, edited by John Defrancis and the new Chinese to English Dictionary by Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press. 

My first question is this: Does the Chinese to English Dictionary by Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press contain both simplified and traditional characters? and my second question is: Does it also have documentation/explanations of characters and usage in English? 

If anyone has any experience with this dictionary I would really appreciate any help you can give me. 

Thanks all, 

Bo Han 

I use the Chinese to English Dictionary by Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press (1993 edition , and I think it is one of the most comprehensive existing Chinese-English dictionary. Its 3 indexes (pinyin, radicals, strokes' number) contain both traditional and simplified characters, and it clearly points out in which cases the exact traditional character equivalent is. 
It is one of the best, even though one can always find an expression not included in the dictionary (perhaps the are more recent edition than the one I have)

 Posted: Sun Jan 25, 2004 12:54 pm    Post subject: Best Dictionary  

If this Shanghai Jiaotong Univ. Press dictionary is the one I'm thinking of (two volumes?) it is a very good dictionary, but I might have to vote for the DeFrances dictionary. The new comprehensive dictionary has a huge number of entries (180,000 or something) and the layout makes it easily the fastest way to look up a word for an English speaker -- especially in listening if you're not sure which character it is under. It has the traditional characters in the back as well as under the single character entries (but be careful--it only includes those characters that occur in isolation, it's truly a &quot;word&quot; dictionary, not a character dictionary as well). The former dictionary seemed to have a good number of Chinese government organization names, etc., and does give the meaning of each characters regardless of usage. I seem to remember that both dictionaries just use simplified characters in the main body but both reference traditional characters in the back. I may be confusing the first dictionary, though! Hope this helps!

The new ABC Comprehensive has traditional characters not only in the rear index and at single character entries, but also at compounds, so that unlike the original ABC, you can now tell which fu4 is in chong2fu4 (versus the one in hui1fu4). Very nice, highly recommended book.

 Good Start Starter, December 28, 2002 
 Reviewer: professordavid (see more about me) from Zionsville, IN USA  
This is a handy companion for the beginning of Chinese study. It includes common words, has large type (very important to me), and lots of cross references and &quot;topical&quot; digressions (languages, dates, special words, etc. referenced with citations). It also has a nice measure word section (some are included with nouns, but not always). It also contains both American and British options in word uses.

What I don't like. It ONLY has simplified characters (I would like the traditional ones included also with a primary citation). Harbaugh's book focuses on traditional ones but has both; the bigger Oxford (Manser, 2nd Ed.) has both. It does not have a pronunciation guide which, as a beginner, would be helpful to remind us (constrain us?). Some common words are not in there (who's judgement call?). And, some examples would be helpful where the primary citation includes precedent words. For example, look up &quot;qi&quot; and be able to find &quot;tianqi&quot;. 

On balance: good overwhelm the bad. After all, it's only about $12-15. As other reviewers have commented, &quot;You need several dictionaries anyway.&quot; Do I use it all the time. Absolutely. It's also more fun than the bigger Oxford (Manser). But if Oxford could see clear to include &quot;my&quot; downsides, I'd be much happier.

 Great for beginners, June 11, 2001 
 Reviewer: rhywun from Astoria, NY United States  
This dictionary is exactly what the beginning student of Mandarin Chinese needs. It's specifically targeted at English speakers who are just beginning to study Chinese. To that end, the size of the vocabulary is limited to just what you need as a beginner; there are numerous detailed usage and grammar notes throughout the dictionary; almost every entry has example phrases or sentences; all Chinese is given in both Pinyin and characters; and perhaps best of all - it's extremely clear, well-designed, and easy to read. My only complaint is that there is no index of traditional characters (all characters are simplified)...but that doesn't really detract from the quality of this dictionary. 

 Very Good Basic Dictionary, April 16, 2004 
 Reviewer: seanezm from Norwalk, CT United States  
I'm very satisfied - I can find every word I need a definition for. The typographic style (colors, bold, etc.)is a pleasure to use. I recommend highly.

 Very good Beginner Dictionary, August 25, 2003 
 Reviewer: markf1 (see more about me) from Union City, CA United States  
A very good English/Mandarin Chinese dictionary. I would give it five stars if it was more complete. The dictionary is missing a lot of words. 

PROs
The best layout I have found for Mandarin/English dictionary
Clear Large Type (somewhere around 10 to 12 point font size)
Chinese Characters are easy to read

CONs
Very basic vocabulary, and is missing a number of important words

 Terrible, content is extremely limited., June 22, 2003 
 Reviewer: A reader from United States  
I know this is a &quot;starter&quot; dictionary, but I wouldn't recommend it even for beginners. There are very, very few entries. If you are studying the simplified characters, get your self a copy of the &quot;Ying Han Cidian&quot; by Beijing Languages Institue.

 Wish I Had It a Year Ago, June 9, 2003 
 Reviewer: Cathy Sahu (see more about me) from Southern California  
I've just completed my first two semesters studying Mandarin and they would have been a lot easier if I had had this dictionary from the beginning. Everyone says how easy Mandarin grammar is and that may be true relative to other languages (and relative to learning Chinese characters!), but you still need to learn quite a bit of Mandarin grammar before you can start formulating sentences. I always felt very uncomfortable doing my homework (translation from English to Chinese) because I didn't know whether I was using the grammar properly or not and had no way of checking. I was worried about accidentally getting into bad grammatical habits without even knowing it, because my textbook (Integrated Chinese) has really very little usage information and neither did the dictionaries I had on hand.

Once I got &quot;The Starter Oxford Dictionary,&quot; however, homework became so much easier and I no longer feel insecure about sentence formulation. The emphasis in this dictionary is on usage, so instead of having tons and tons of words (which you can get from a regular dictionary), it has a fewer number of words with their usages very clearly explained and illustrated. For example: the entry for the English word &quot;can&quot;: &quot;Oxford Starter&quot; divides &quot;can&quot; into three subcategories: &quot;to have the possibility&quot; (translated as neng); &quot;to know how to&quot; (hui); &quot;to be allowed to&quot; (keyi). The &quot;neng&quot; entry then gives two illustrative sentences &quot;Can he come?/Ta neng lia ma?&quot; and &quot;Where can I buy stamps?/Wo zai nar neng maidao youpiao?&quot; The &quot;hui&quot; subcategory has three such illustrative sentences and the &quot;keyi&quot; has four. There are also two warnings on translating &quot;can,&quot; one for &quot;hui&quot; and one for &quot;keyi&quot;: &quot;Note that when talking about the ability to speak a language, whether or not &quot;can&quot; is used in English, &quot;hui&quot; is required in Chinese&quot; and &quot;Note that to negate, you have to use &quot;bu neng&quot; rather than &quot;bu keyi.&quot;

Odds are, if you're studying Chinese, you're a bibiophile, too, so probably you don't need a lot of convincing to buy yet another Chinese dictionary. But in praise of this work I have to say that, if I could have only one book to help me learn elementary Mandarin, this would be it.

(Note: &quot;The Oxford Started Chinese&quot; does use only simplified characters. However, I am learning with traditional and found it wasn't that difficult to figure out what the traditional equivalents were, especially since the entries are organized by pinyin. It would be nice to have a traditional edition but I still wholeheartedly recommend the simplified.) 

 TWO thumbs up!, June 8, 2003 
 Reviewer: A reader from Australia  
I'm in my 2nd year of learning Chinese at university and would have to be one of the 'weaker' students. I originally bought the Concise Chinese Dictionary because it was listed on the text book list. I bought this dictionary a week ago and am LOVING it! 
I have my exam in a week and I am confident about using this dictionary in it becaues of it's excellent layout. 
My one gripe is that it is missing the word &quot;discount&quot; and the dicount concept... 

Two thumbs up for this dictionary!

 Great beginners reference, especially for self-study., May 31, 2003 
 Reviewer: ed-word (see more about me) from El Paso, Texas United States  
Don't let the fact that this is a beginner's dictionary lead you to believe that it is wimpy and overly simplstic. You will indeed need several dictionarys anyway if you are going to undertake a study of Chinese; the beginner, especially those who are attempting self-study, can do no better than starting here. If you are a tourist going to China this is the one dictionary you want; its small, cheap, easy to use, and concentrates on commonly used words and expressions.

The dictionary is bi-directional with the Chinese entries arranged alphabeticaly in pinyin romanization accompaied by the simplified Chinese character equivalents that have been used in mainland China for the past 50 years. There are brief sections on grammar, the use of tones in spoken Mandarin, radical and character indices, and lots of explanatory notes regarding usage.

As you continue your study of Chinese you will eventually outgrow this dictionary. Be that as it may there are some tools one uses more than others and the beginning student of Chinese will turn to this starter dictionary more often than whatever else is likely to be present in his or her toolbox.

 Highly Recommended!!, November 27, 2002 
  Reviewer: Walter Reade (see more about me) from Appleton, WI United States  
As a &quot;beginning&quot; student of Chinese for a few years now, I have gone through a large number of Chinese language resources. This is one that I would unhesitatingly recommend to anyone.

The dictionary is at the right level for beginning students. The entries are limited to the most commonly used words. This is a major advantage for those who like to learn vocabulary by browsing a dictionary -- you are sure to be learning useful words (as opposed to specialty or infrequently used words). There have been only a few times where I have look for a word that wasn't included in this dictionary. I expect that the casual learner of Chinese will not outgrow this dictionary for at least a year or two. 

I found the format of the dictionary extremely uncluttered and user friendly. In addition to the standard word and definition, entries also include very useful notes of clarification. For example, after the character for hui4 (&quot;to be able to&quot;) there a note explaining that this character can also be pronounced as kuai4 with a different meaning.

Another resource I have been extremely pleased with and highly recommend is, &quot;Chinese Character Flashcards 888.&quot; Good luck in your studies!!

 When do we get the extended ?, November 26, 2002 
 Reviewer: maotouying (see more about me) from Athens, GA United States  
I only have one hope... that Oxford brings the extended version of its dictionary in the same wonderful format ! I understand this would make the dictionary big and ponderous... I don't care ! This is by far the best format I have ever seen on a Chinese dictionary ! 

 But now with TRADITIONAL characters as well!!, May 26, 2002 
 Reviewer: W. R. Kelly from Providence, RI United States  
This is a great little, general-use, beginning dictionary. But beware, for those of us learning traditional chinese characters first, you'll need something more, as this book uses ONLY SIMPLIFIED CHARACTERS--and they don't actually tell you that anywhere. You have to discover it on your own. 

I hope they will put out another edition in traditional characters soon. Or else add to the current book both trad. chars. AND simplified ones when the forms vary.

 Bogus Review ?, May 2, 2002 
 Reviewer: McGeorge from Beijing  
Like the first three reviewers, I rate this dictionary the best BASIC dictionary there is. Mr Bernard Kornowicz's comments are perfect (I also totally endorse his comments about the &quot;miserable Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot;, which is supposed to be a companion, more advanced dictionary, but is mediocre).
Rated by fitness for purpose, this is the best there is for serious, beginning/intermediate level learners.
What a pity that a perfect star rating was spoiled by &quot;Volleyballbrian&quot;, with a sloppy review which overlooks the fact that good intermediate dictionaries HAVE to be selective on the number of words.
I have the feeling that the &quot;Vbb review&quot; is sabotage from a competitor !

 Extremely helpful...long overdue., February 28, 2002 
 Reviewer: A reader from PARIS France  
This Dictionary has been so well-conceived that I felt obliged to take the time to compliment the authors on a work well done. This particular edition is a God-send to any English speaker struggling to obtain an intermediate level in Mandarin Chinese. The entries were carefully chosen so as not to weigh the dictionary down with uncommon words. As far as the typeset is concerned...the Chinese characters are printed LARGE and CLEAR so readers don't go blind trying to differentiate characters with several strokes. Chinese will never be easy to learn as it states on the cover, but at least this dictionary gives us a chance!

 Decent start book, but better out there, February 21, 2002 
 Reviewer: volleyballbrian (see more about me) from Galveston, TX United States  
This is a decent starting book. I enjoyed the small section on the 4 tones of Chinese and basic structure. The lookup section for both english and chinese was very easy to use, but the words included is EXTREMELY limited. If you are serious about learning Chinese, this book is not a good choice, buy a better dictionary such as the Concise english-chinese chinese-english dictionary ..., much better dictionary. If you are looking for something easy to use and read and only look up very common words, this would be OK.

 Barely Enough for Even Beginners, December 4, 2001 
 Reviewer: A reader from Washington, DC United States  
This is physically a very nicely put together book, with very readable type, attractive layout and design, and sturdy paper. Nevertheless, this is an altogether inadequate dictionary, even for beginners. There simply aren't enough words provided in this book. You are likely to become as frustrated as I was, after purchasing this book, to time and again fail to find definitions for commonplace words from day-to-day conversation. Until Oxford drops the &quot;starter&quot; concept and doubles or triples the listings in this volume, don't waste your time or money. Get an unabridged Chinese dictionary, even if you are a beginner. I wish now that I had.

 more starter than dictionary, November 3, 2001 
 Reviewer: shazan from Cambridge, MA  
this is a good aid to language study for beginners, but it's not really a dictionary in the normal sense. perhaps 'learner's vocabulary guide' would have been a better title. when reading any but the simplest of texts you will find it insufficient.

 Good but I think should include traditonal characters, June 26, 2001 
 Reviewer: Eduardo Morales (see more about me) from MIAMI, FLORIDA USA  
It is good but somehow limited in scope, I wish it had also traditional characters. However each entry is colorful and very well explained. It is a must for beginners.

 Great dictionary for beginners, April 11, 2001 
 Reviewer: Stacie (see more about me) from Kentucky  
In addition to the definitions, it has a section on writing characters, counting/money, a section on measure words, and much more. It gives everything a beginner needs. I would strongly recommend it to anyone just starting Mandarin Chinese, 

3 of 3 

 great choice for learners, April 9, 2001 
 Reviewer: A reader from Beverly Hills, CA USA  
I am in the third quarter of a first-year Mandarin class, and about a third of the class has bought this dictionary. I suspect the rest of my classmates will soon follow. It's easy to read and contains extremely useful explanations of usage and grammatical points, making it a wonderful adjunct to our textbook. You will need another more comprehensive dictionary for vocabulary purposes, but I haven't seen a better dictionary for first and second year students. Buy it!

 Oxford finally gets it right!, March 11, 2001 
 Reviewer: Bernard Kornowicz (see more about me) from Newington, Connecticut USA  
This is the best Chinese/English dictionary I've found so far. It's a beginner's dictionary, but hopefully Oxford University Press will learn from this one and apply the same quality standards to their more extensive, but miserably formatted and somewhat inaccurate &quot;Concise English-Chinese Chinese-English Dictionary&quot;. This dictionary is very easy to read. The lookup words are in large, blue print. Multiple definitions are bulleted and numerically categorized by noun, adverb, etc. Word definitions also contain the Chinese characters and examples of usage. There are radical and character indices, rules for writing characters, and a section on measure words. The English to Chinese section also contains the measure words in the definitions, as well as British and U.S. English spellings if there is a difference. There are also many language usage tips throughout the dictionary.</text>

Summary  
In July 1799, a French officer serving in Napoleons Egyptian expedition unearthed a granite block bearing text in three different scripts Greek, demotic Egyptian, and hieroglyphics. Following the discovery, a remarkable competition ensued for possession of the stone as well as for decoding its inscription. Using all the elements of a detective thriller, the authors, a well-known novelist and a leading Egyptologist, tell the story of international intrigue surrounding the intellectual quest to crack the stones code the key to reading ancient Egyptian texts for the first time in 14 centuries. Also included are reproductions of the stone and its inscriptions as well as portraits of the key figures involved in its translation.

Chapter One 

Fort Julien 

Archaeology? That was last thing on the minds of the French soldiers occupying northern Egypt in July 1799! Thousands of Ottoman invaders had just landed at Abukir — that accursed place where the preceding year Napoleon's fleet had been cut to pieces by the English. They had no difficulty in taking the fort over which the French tricolour flew. The burning question was what their next target would be: Alexandria or Rosetta? 

    In contrast to Alexandria, which looked like a large, dusty village, Rosetta was an attractive and prosperous city. Situated on the west branch of the Nile, a few kilometres from the Mediterranean, it was green throughout the year. It was full of banana, orange, fig and date trees, and had an abundant supply of pigeons and milk. Europeans thought it the most pleasant city in Egypt. 

    North of Rosetta, fortifications were being hurriedly built to resist a possible Ottoman assault. ‘I expect to be attacked at any time,’ the local commander wrote to Napoleon on 18 July. ‘I am vigilant and I hope the enemy will not take Fort Julien as easily as he took the fort at Abukir.’ 

    ‘Fort Julien’ was the Borg Rashid (the tower of Rosetta), a dilapidated fortress built in the fifteenth century by the sultan Qait Bey. The French renamed it in memory of one of Napoleon's aides-de-camp, Adjutant-General Julien (spelled ‘Jullien’ in some military documents), who had been killed nearby, along with his escort, the previous July. 

    Located in a palm grove on the east bank of the Nile, Borg Rashid was too far inland to control the entrance from the sea. However, from the fort an observer with the appropriate equipment could survey the whole breadth of the river's mouth, as well as the opposite bank. On taking it, the French found ruined walls eighty metres on a side, with four movable turrets in which not even an ‘eight-pound cannon could be mounted’. On the ramparts connecting the turrets, the crenellations were uncovered. The tower keep at the centre of the fortress contained a small mosque and two cisterns. Until more significant modifications could be made, they had hastily to adapt the turreted bastions and construct a terreplein bordering the ramparts. Living quarters, a hospital, ovens, guard units and ammunition dumps were set up, ‘sheltered from bombs’. The establishment of this line of defence was entrusted to d'Hautpol, the leader of a battalion of engineers, assisted by Lieutenant Bouchard. History was to forget the former and immortalize the latter, by associating him with one of the most exciting scientific adventures of all time. 




An officer-scientist 




During the second week of July, while clearing away debris in part of Borg Rashid, Bouchard and his men found a block of dark-coloured stone about one metre in height. One of its sides, highly polished, bore thousands of small marks inscribed in three different scripts: the text on top was in hieroglyphs, the one on the bottom in Greek, and between the two were characters that could not be identified. 

    There was no reason for hieroglyphs to be found in an Arab fortress. Could the fortress have been built on the side of an ancient monument? Geographers were to declare this impossible, for in antiquity this region was covered by the waters of the Nile, which encroached much further on the dry land. All indications were that the stone had been erected elsewhere and brought to the site centuries later to be reused for other purposes. Later on, it would be proven that, like many of the decorated blocks used in the city's residences, it came from one of the temples in Sais, on the same branch of the river. 

    Who was the first to see the Stone in the July heat? A soldier? An engineer? An Egyptian manual labourer? Who first cried out in surprise and realized that this might be a treasure? The official report attributes the discovery to Pierre François Xavier Bouchard, and there is no reason to doubt that this loyal and conscientious officer, who was then twenty-eight years of age and had always served the Republic much better than it ever served him, was the first European to set eyes on the Rosetta Stone. After all, Bouchard was a ‘scientist’: when the French first landed in Egypt a year earlier, he had belonged not to the army but to the Commission of Arts and Sciences, that is, to the group of some 160 civilians Napoleon had recruited to accompany his expedition. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone — by chance, in an improbable place and at an inappropriate moment — was at least made by a ‘scientist’ ... 

    The son of a carpenter, Bouchard was born on 29 April 1771 in Orgelet, a small village in the Jura mountains. After completing his studies in Besançon, he was conscripted into the army, assigned to a company of grenadiers, and sent to the front in Champagne and Belgium. At twenty-three, this tall, dark man from the Jura, found himself in a new branch of the army: the aérostiers, an observational balloon corps that had performed with distinction in the battle of Fleurus. He soon became the assistant head of the aerostatic school established in Meudon under the direction of a brilliant inventor, Nicolas Jacques Conté, to whom we owe the artificial pencil lead. The two men were both wounded in a laboratory accident that left Bouchard with severely impaired vision in one eye. 

    In 1796, even though he had passed the age limit, the son of the Orgelet carpenter was admitted to the recently established École polytechnique. Less than two years later, he decided, along with other students and several professors, to follow General Bonaparte on a lengthy expedition whose goal was kept secret. It was to be Egypt ... Bouchard took his final examination in Cairo and joined the engineering corps. He was not assigned to Rosetta until June 1799, a few weeks before the discovery of the famous Stone. 




Three versions of the same text 




The Stone was dusted off and sheltered, so that it could be closely examined. It weighed 720 kilos, and was 114 centimetres high, 72 centimetres wide and 27 centimetres thick on average. Its upper part was missing, as well as the lower right corner. 

    Although the Frenchmen then in Rosetta were unable to make anything of the first two inscriptions, they could read the Greek. They determined that it was a rather obscure expression of homage to a certain Ptolemy, written on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of his coronation. So far, nothing earth-shattering. It would interest only a historian of ancient Egypt ... But the last sentence excited them: ‘This decree shall be inscribed on stelae of hard rock, in sacred characters, both native and Greek, and they shall be erected in each of the temples of the first, second and third category, next to the image of the king living eternally.’ The stela contained the same text written in three different scripts! This opened a stunning perspective — starting from the Greek, wouldn't it be possible to decipher the hieroglyphics, which no one had been able to read for fourteen centuries? The importance of the ‘stone with three inscriptions’ seems to have been immediately perceived. A fine example of scientific intuition, even as the roar of battle could be heard close by. 

    What role should we attribute to Michel-Ange Lancret, who was assigned to the region around Rosetta? This twenty-five year old engineer, who had studied architecture before turning to mathematics, was in the first class to graduate from the École polytechnique. He had just been elected to the Institut d'Égypte created by Napoleon on the model of the Institut national. Lancret was a brilliant young man, but he lacked Bouchard's training in archaeology: he was simply one of the young ‘scientists’ who were open-minded and able to move beyond their own disciplines to take a passionate interest in something new. A year earlier, at the first session of the Institut d'Égypte, the mathematician Gaspard Monge, who presided over this scientific academy, had encouraged his colleagues to open their eyes and devote themselves ‘to the study of ancient monuments, to explaining these mysterious signs, these granite pages on which an enigmatic history is inscribed.’ 

    It was Lancret who wrote a letter informing members of the Institute of the discovery of the stela, while Bouchard was entrusted with transporting it up the Nile by boat and bringing it to the capital. The Frenchmen in Cairo thus learned at the same time of the existence of the Rosetta Stone and of Napoleon's crushing defeat of the Ottomans at Abukir on 25 July. Both were good news — and news of great importance.</text>

Summary  
The French linguist who decoded the Rosetta Stone took 14 years to do so; amateur translators would find the task much simpler with Decoding Egyptian Hieroglyphs: How to Read the Secret Language of the Pharaohs by British doctoral student Bridget McDermott. For instance: &quot;a water pot on a human leg, a bread loaf and a flesh sign together&quot; means &quot;meat.&quot; The colorful text, a marriage between coffee-table picture book and high school language workbook, offers photographs of ancient inscriptions with sidebars clarifying their meaning as well as pronunciation and grammar guides, magic spells, maps, mythology and basic Egyptian history.

Chapter One 




DISCOVERY &amp; DECIPHERMENT 




In 1799 a French officer at Fort Julien in el-Rashîd in Egypt uncovered a 
granitic rock carved with three scripts: hieroglyphs, demotic or popular 
Egyptian, and ancient Greek. The slab was the key to deciphering hieroglyphs. 






THE ROSETTA STONE



The officer was a member of a French 
expeditionary force to Egypt, and copies 
of the inscription on the slab — later 
called the Rosetta Stone after European 
versions of el- Rashîd — were sent to Paris. 
By examining the Greek text on the slab, 
scholars saw that the carving commemorated 
the coronation of Ptolemy V and had 
been commissioned by priests of 
Memphis in 196BCE. But it was years 
before the fourteen lines of Egyptian 
hieroglyphs were deciphered. 


    Jean-François Champollion, a precocious 
French linguist, obtained a copy of 
the Rosetta Stone inscription in 1808 
when he was only eighteen. Fluent in 
ancient Greek, he compared the hieroglyphs 
in oval enclosures — which were 
believed to contain royal names — to the 
royal names listed in the Greek section of 
the inscription. Other scholars had identified 
Ptolemy in Greek and Egyptian. 
Champollion assumed that the name 
should be read alphabetically and that 
each hieroglyph represented a separate 
letter, and by reading from right to left 
established the name p-t-o-l-m-y-s. He 
was able to draw up a small alphabet. 


    When he saw a copy of an inscription 
containing the name Cleopatra, he made 
a longer sign list that enabled him to read 
names on other monuments. He realized 
that hieroglyphs used signs that represented 
both sounds and ideas and he 
examined the grammar of the language, 
making his findings public in 1822. 





   THE HISTORY OF THE LANGUAGE 




Around 3000BCE developments in trade 
brought about crosscultural relationships 
between Egypt, Mesopotamia and neighbouring 
countries. The Sumerians of 
Mesopotamia had developed a system of 
writing that used pictograms or picture 
signs and for many years scholars 
believed that this system was the basis of 
Egyptian writing. Recent excavations at 
Abydos, however, have revealed that 
Egypt had used a pictorial language several 
hundred years before Mesopotamia. 


    The oldest surviving examples of written 
Egyptian date from c.3250BCE. At first 
the pictorial script was used primarily to 
record royal possessions but by the Old 
Kingdom (2625-2130BCE) the script 
appeared mainly in religious or commemorative 
inscriptions on palaces, 
temples and tombs, on statues, coffins 
and sarcophagi and on amulets and jewelry. 
For this reason the Greeks who ruled 
Egypt after the death of Alexander the 
Great in 323BCE called the writing &quot;hieroglyphics&quot; 
from the Greek words hieros 
(meaning &quot;sacred&quot;) and gluphe (&quot;carving&quot;). 
Hieroglyphic writing was in use for 
more than 3,000 years from the fourth 
millennium BCE to the fourth century of 
the Christian era, when — in a Roman-dominated 
Egypt — it faded into obscurity. 
The latest known inscriptions in 
hieroglyphs date from 24 August 394CE 
and were discovered on the island of 
Philae in the River Nile in southern 
Egypt, where a temple to the goddess Isis 
was still in use in the sixth century CE. 


    Hieroglyphic signs were written in 
columns and rows and read from right to 
left, from left to right or from top to bottom 
— but never from bottom to top (see 
page 19). A simplified form of hieroglyphic 
writing probably first appeared 
shortly after the introduction of the original 
hieroglyphs. In the Old Kingdom this 
simplified form was used for secular 
administrative papyri as well as for temple 
accounts and religious texts. In the 
Greco-Roman period (332BCE-CE395), 
however, it was used only by priests and 
in religious contexts — the Greeks named 
it &quot;hieratic&quot;, from hieratikos (&quot;priestly&quot;). 
Scribes wrote hieratic in columns and 
rows; in rows it read from right to left. 


    A more rapid form of writing — best 
described as a shorthand used for administrative 
documents — first appeared in 
724-712BCE and continued in use until the 
late Roman period (fourth century CE). 
The Egyptians identified it by a phrase 
meaning &quot;writing of documents&quot;, but it is 
widely known as &quot;demotic&quot; from the 
Greek demotikos (&quot;popular&quot;), because it 
was used in secular writing. 


    A fourth form of written Egyptian was 
Coptic. This was written in the Greek 
alphabet but retained seven characters 
from the ancient Egyptian language. 
While earlier forms of Egyptian used only 
consonants in their alphabets (see pages 
22-23), Coptic used vowels as well and 
has helped scholars reconstruct the vowel 
sounds of hieroglyphic writing. The earliest 
Coptic texts, which date from the first 
and second centuries CE, were Egyptian 
magical writings. The name comes from 
the Greek Aiguptia, &quot;Egypt&quot;. After the 
Arab conquest of Egypt in 640-642CE, 
Arabic largely replaced Coptic in Egypt. 


    The language of Egypt is divided by 
historians into Old, Middle and Late 
Egyptian. Old Egyptian is dated to 
3180-2240BCE and was used in official, 
funerary and biographical inscriptions. 
Middle Egyptian (2240-1990BCE) was 
developed in literary compositions of the 
Middle Kingdom and continued in use 
well into the Eighteenth Dynasty (1539-1292BCE). 
Because it is grammatically 
consistent, Middle Egyptian is the best 
place to start when learning to read 
hieroglyphs. Late Egyptian, dating to 
1573-715BCE, is found in official documents, 
inscriptions and letters. 






THE SCRIBAL LEGACY



In ancient Egypt, those able to read or write the elaborate hieroglyphic 
script were held in great esteem, and often became prominent figures in 
the religious, military or political realms. Literacy was limited to members of 
the élite. Highly trained scribes used hieroglyphs to facilitate the administration 
of the state and to document political and religious events. 






THE ROLE OF THE SCRIBE



From the age of seven, boys from Egypt's 
upper classes attended school at temple, 
where they practised their writing on 
ostraca (fragments of pottery or limestone) 
or on wooden writing boards that 
were coated with gypsum. Pupils probably 
also learned words and phrases by heart 
by chanting them. Boys are also known to 
have studied literary compositions 
including stories and wisdom texts. 


    It is thought that Egyptian further 
education began between the ages of thirteen 
and fifteen, when students were 
expected to embark on an apprenticeship. 
Among the many trades open to 
educated young men, the military and 
scribal professions were particularly 
highly regarded. Those who chose to 
become scribes enjoyed promising 
prospects — qualified scribes could expect 
to graduate to prestigious administrative 
positions in a range of sectors. Military 
scribes were responsible for recruiting 
and organizing the army and its supplies. 
Some scribes acted as architects, while 
others designed the plans for decorating 
royal tombs and temples with hieroglyphs 
and pictures, and supervised the artists 
and craftsmen who carried the plans out. 


    Individual scribes, even if they came 
from relatively humble backgrounds, 
were sometimes promoted to positions of 
high office. Imhotep, the scribe and 
architect of the step pyramid at Saqqara, 
was even worshipped as a god after his 
death, as was another famous scribe, 
Amenhotep son of Hapu (see page 17). 


    The ancient Egyptians revered literacy, 
and even élite men who were not 
scribes sometimes commissioned statues 
of themselves kneeling crosslegged on 
the ground in the pose that characterized 
the profession. The scribe is usually 
depicted with rolls of writing material 
stretched across his knees. The Egyptians 
wrote on bone, clay, ivory, linen, metal 
and vellum, but ostraca and papyrus were 
more widely used. Scribes selected small 
rectangular sections or rolls of papyrus, 
which were several metres in length. 
Egyptian books, in the form of scrolls, 
were usually stored in boxes or jars. 


    The hieroglyphic word for &quot;scribe&quot; 
?? ss/sesh (see pages 20-23 for transliteration 
and pronunciation of hieroglyphs) 
starts with an image of the scribal 
palette and tools; the determinative sign 
(see page 24) is a kneeling male figure 
that represents a scribe at work. The 
scribal palette consisted of black and red 
inks that were used to distinguish 
between sections of text. The black pigment 
was derived from carbon, while the 
red was extracted from two types of iron 
oxide and ochre. Both pigments were 
moulded into small cakes which were 
mixed with gum and water. Pens and 
brushes were crafted from the firm, 
straight stems of reeds or from slivers of 
wood which were bruised at one end until 
the fibres separated and formed bristles. 
The word &quot;to write&quot; ?? ss/sesh is almost 
identical to the word for &quot;scribe&quot;, and was 
pronounced in the same way. It shows the 
scribal palette and pen followed by the 
image of a sealed papyrus roll. 






HOW HIEROGLYPHS WORK



For centuries hieroglyphs were an unbreakable code because scholars 
were misled by the ancient Egyptians' use of symbols in writing. To break 
the code modern readers had to understand — as Jean-François Champollion 
did — that the symbols represent both sounds and ideas (see page 20). The 
first step of all, however, is to examine how scribes arranged the hieroglyphs. 





    THE ARRANGEMENT OF SIGNS 




Ancient Egyptian scribes wrote hieroglyphs 
in both rows and columns with no 
spaces between the words. Inscriptions 
can be read from left to right or from right 
to left along a row and in a column from 
top to bottom. 


    When reading a row you can work out 
in which direction to read because signs 
containing humans, animals or birds 
always face toward the beginning of the 
inscription. For example, when the word 
for &quot;drink&quot; is written like this ?? 
it should be read from the left because the 
human figure and the bird are facing 
toward the left. If it is written in this way 
?? it is read from the right. 


    When a row of hieroglyphs appears 
vertically reading should begin at the top, 
for hieroglyphs were never written from 
the bottom to the top of a column. Within 
a row if two signs are put together vertically — as 
the bird and the mouth sign are 
in &quot;drink&quot; — the upper one should be read 
first. The signs in &quot;drink&quot; should therefore 
be read in this order ?? (folded cloth) 
?? (sparrow), ?? (mouth), ?? (reed), 
?? (water ripples) and ?? (man). 


    The signs reproduced in this book are 
printed as we are accustomed to read 
English — in a straight line from left to 
right. However, scribes used hieroglyphs 
as part of the decorative scheme of the 
monument, tomb or other object on 
which they were writing, often arranging 
the signs in the way most pleasing to the 
eye. When carving an inscription on a 
monument, they would group the signs to 
fill the space available. Sometimes they 
repeated pieces of text in opposing directions 
for symmetrical effect. 






SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATION



Before Jean-François Champollion made 
his inspired breakthrough in the decoding 
of hieroglyphs (see page 11), scholars 
believed that all hieroglyphic symbols 
stood for concepts or things and that 
none was used to represent sounds in the 
way that the letters of the English alphabet 
are used. In fact hieroglyphic writing, 
as Champollion understood, combines 
ideograms (signs that represent ideas and 
things) and phonograms (signs that represent 
sounds). 


    Many signs depict recognizable creatures 
or things — for example, ?? (bull), 
?? (horse) or ?? (child). Many depict 
stylized versions of the thing to which 
they refer, as in ?? (lotus pool), ?? 
(lotus flower) or ?? (palm branch stripped 
of leaves). Sometimes a sign is used as the 
word for the object it depicts. For 
instance, the word for &quot;mouth&quot; ?? consists 
of the mouth sign written with a single 
stroke that indicates, among other 
things, that this word refers to the thing 
that is represented. Similarly the words 
for &quot;sun&quot; ?? and &quot;arm&quot; ?? are written 
with the signs that represent those 
objects. More usually, however, hieroglyphic 
signs represent sounds in the 
Egyptian language — they are used as 
phonograms. Two picture signs representing 
different sounds can be put 
together to make a new word, which often 
has nothing to do with the things represented 
by the picture signs themselves. A 
hypothetical English equivalent usually 
quoted by scholars would be to write 
&quot;belief&quot; by combining the images of a bee 
and a tree's leaf: bee-leaf. If you were trying 
to decode this hypothetical English 
hieroglyph and expected the resulting 
word to relate to bees, leaves, honey or 
trees, you would be heading in entirely 
the wrong direction. 


    By careful comparison of the use of 
hieroglyphic signs in different contexts, 
scholars have identified specific signs 
with individual sounds. Where possible 
they have matched these sounds with the 
letters of the English alphabet. But some 
sounds in ancient Egyptian do not have 
exact equivalents in English and so cannot 
be represented using letters of the 
alphabet; in these cases scholars have 
developed a set of signs to represent the 
sounds (see pages 22-23). The translation 
of hieroglyphic pictures into sounds 
is called &quot;transliteration&quot;. Ancient 
Egyptian hieroglyphs did not represent 
vowel sounds (a,e,i,o,u) and so only consonants 
are used in transliteration. 


    In the word for &quot;house&quot; ?? the rectangle 
represents a house; the pronunciation 
of the word combined the consonant 
sounds p and r — and the sign is 
transliterated using those letters: pr. The 
word for &quot;to go forth&quot; ?? made the same 
sound combination. In this context the 
sign of the house works to represent the 
sound combination pr(i); the mouth sign 
reinforces this, because it represents the 
sound r; the sign for walking legs helps to 
distinguish between the house symbol 
used as an ideogram in ?? and the same 
symbol used as a phonogram in &quot;to go 
forth&quot; — the leg sign indicates that the 
word is to do with movement and is an 
example of a determinative (see page 24). 


    Scholars do not know for certain how 
the ancient Egyptians pronounced the 
words represented by hieroglyphs, but 
they have a good idea based on comparative 
research in Coptic (see page 13). As 
well as transliterating hieroglyphic signs 
into recognizable letters (but using only 
consonants), we can write out the word's 
probable pronunciation complete with 
vowel sounds. The word house ??, 
transliterated pr, was probably pronounced 
&quot;pair&quot;. In this book the hieroglyphic 
words cited are followed firstly by 
the transliteration, then the pronunciation, 
thus: &quot;house&quot; ?? pr/pair; &quot;mistress 
of the house&quot; ?? ?? nbt-pr/nebet -pair; the 
ancient name for Egypt (&quot;the black land&quot;) 
?? ?? ?? kmt/Kemet. 






THE ALPHABET



Ancient Egyptian used a standard alphabet 
of twenty-four &quot;letters&quot; each of which 
represented a single consonant. The letters 
are shown in the box below alongside 
their transliteration (see pages 20-21) — either 
a letter from the English alphabet 
or a transliteration sign devised by scholars 
— and their probable pronunciation. 


    The sounds represented by the 
transliteration signs given in the alphabet 
box below are as follows: 3 — glottal stop, 
similar to &quot;thro'le&quot; (for &quot;throttle&quot;) in 
Cockney English; i — like &quot;y&quot;; ?? — guttural 
&quot;ah&quot; sound; h — emphatic &quot;h&quot;; h — similar 
to &quot;ch&quot; in Scottish &quot;loch&quot;; h — similar 
to &quot;ch&quot; in German &quot;ich&quot;; š — &quot;sh&quot; 
as in &quot;shimmy&quot;; k — &quot;kw&quot; like &quot;q&quot; in 
&quot;queen&quot;; t — similar to to &quot;t&quot; in &quot;tube&quot;; d 
-&quot;dj&quot; similar to &quot;j&quot; in &quot;joker&quot;. 


    The language also used a number of 
signs that represented combinations of 
two consonants (these are known as 
&quot;biliteral signs&quot;) or combinations of 
three consonants (known as &quot;triliteral 
signs&quot;). A list of biliteral signs and a 
selection of triliteral signs is given on 
pages 158-9 in the Reference File section 
at the end of this book. 






DETERMINATIVES



Two English words can sound identical 
but have different meanings — for example, 
&quot;pear&quot; and &quot;pair&quot;. In hieroglyphs, 
where no vowels were written, words 
commonly shared a spelling. The adjective 
?? &quot;old&quot; and the noun ?? 
&quot;praise&quot; both read i3w/ah-oo. When 
words looked alike in this way, Egyptian 
scribes added what scholars call determinatives 
— ideograms used to determine or 
make clear the meaning. The determinative 
for ?? &quot;old&quot; is a stooping, elderly 
man while the determinative for &quot;praise&quot; 
is a figure raising hands in worship. 
Determinatives do not have a phonetic 
function — they represent no sound. 
Ideograms of a man ?? or parts of the 
male anatomy including the penis ?? 
and ?? were used to determine words 
with male aspects: for example, ?? 
s3/sar &quot;son&quot; and ?? h3y/hay &quot;husband&quot;. 
Ideograms of a woman ?? were 
used to determine words with female 
aspects such as ?? mwt/moot &quot;mother&quot;.

ChouDoufu wrote this another thread but I am quoting it here to start a new topic, because it is an interesting and important issue. Let the debate begin... 

ChouDoufu wrote: 
Yes, learning Chinese characters are difficult. That's the only thing I agree with though. There are a lot of people who have a belief that writing systems should be phonetic (I find it incredibly ironic that a native English speaker is praising the English phonetic system. English phonetics don't make a lot of sense either--under pronunciation rules in english &quot;ghoti&quot; can sound like &quot;fish). Well, obviously if a language had a phonetic alphabet, it makes it easier to write and read. But to say that All languages need to be phonetic is just ridiculous. What makes Chinese appealing to so many people are the characters. Without the characters, Chinese would be destroying thousands of years of history. 

I don't think they should do that in order to appease people who want to learn the language. I've always found characters to be rewarding and intruiging. 

Yes it's difficult, but it's the difficulties that make things interesting.

I pretty much agree with Chou Doufu. Also I'd like to add that one advantage characters have over a phonetic writing system is that with characters, readers immediately get the meaning in his or her head. It's almost like looking at a painting rather than just text. Good examples can be found in Japanese where the writing system is a mixture of characters (Kanji) and phoentic letters (kanas). 

However, a phoentic system is also extremely important and also has its advantages. This is why the Zhuyin Fuhao was first invented in the early 1900's and then later Hanyu Pinyin.

Thanks for starting the thread wix, I hadn't had time to do it myself last night.

Sorry, but they don't. Nobody who hadn't studied Chinese (or any other simliar language could look at ? and think fish - it's only through repeated association of the symbol and the idea that the meaning comes into your head. 

If readers immediately got the meaning in their head, we wouldn't need to learn Chinese - we would already know it.

Kind of an interesting paradox here. Sure written language came after spoken language but the pictographic or ideographic nature of Chinese characters says to me that the effort to develop the written language wasn't based entirely on the spoken word but also attempted to pictorially represent the thing, concept, idea, etc. So once you know what a character means it seems to me possible that at least some of its meaning is taken in visually rather than aurally. Even with my limited knowledge of Chinese, there are times when I remember what a character means but not how to say it. 
And the use in China of certain characters in art of various forms suggests that much of its meaning is indeed transferred visually. There's a big difference between having a painting on the wall with DAO and one with ? 

cheers, 
john

Uhm, you're kidding right? Although I didn't specify but I assumed people would know that I was talking about people who know the characters. Of course the modern Hanzi won't look like anything but scribbles to those who don't know Chinese...

You can't say that characters have a natural association with the idea they represent: even the ideographic class of characters is opaque to anyone who hasn't learned their meaning. In both character and phonetic writing you have a sign which corresponds to an idea. With characters, you have a vast number of signs, the pronounciation of which is bascially arbitrary, and varies by dialaect and time period. With phonetic writing, you have a small set of signs that indicate sounds. 

The Chinese writing system is ineffecient in that it requires a lot of investment in order to master written communication; in the past this helped keep the literati in power, by maintaining a monopoly on the creation and spread of texts. Regardless of its artistic or historical value, the character system has no benefits over a phonetic system. It's only the massive inertia of the character system that keeps it alive; Vietnam and Korea were successful in developing phonetic systems to write their languages, whereas in the past they used Chinese characters. 

I was pretty excited about Chinese characters too until I read Asia's Orthographic Dilemma. If you strip away the exoticism that comes with a 'strange' method of writing, you may realize that, at best, hanzi solve many of the problems that they themselves cause.

This means readers of phonetic scripts don't immediately get the meaning in their head, which is simply not true - I can't believe reading ? is any more immediate than reading fish. 

I'd also like to agree with what sudsana wrote - and thanks for saving me the bother of typing it all.

Using the Chinese character for fish is a horrible example to make a point for phonetics. The key to learning new words in Chinese is understanding the importance of compound meanings. This allows you to guess at the meaning of new words by immediately analyzing the two characters it's comprised of. 
For example, if I just write &quot;nankan&quot; in pinyin phonetics then a Chinese guy won't have any clue what it means. Yet when he sees the characters for &quot;nan&quot; and &quot;kan&quot; then at least he knows the new word means &quot;something that is difficult to look at&quot; and concludes that those two characters together mean &quot;ugly&quot;

Yeah, I agree that once you've learnt the characters Chinese isn't so difficult - and like the ugly example, Chinese vocabulary can be beautifully logical. 

It's learning the characters in the first place that's the problem - not just for us, but for generations of Chinese people.

And . . .(forgot this) 

I've been told that it's impossible to create an adequate phonetic system for Chinese, as there are so few phonemes you have too many homonyns. 

Sounds like rubbish to me. A phonetic script is simply one that includes all the information given by the spoken language - if you have a spoken language that works, then you can have a phonetic system. You just need a consistent orthagraphy - whether you do this with tone marks above vowels, numbers after syllables, or whatever, it'll work. 

Sure, you might have problems with words in isolation - context won't help you - but how often do you have words in isolation?

There is a sample chapter of Asia's Orthographic Dilemma available online for those who are interested. I strongly suggest that everyone reads it in order to be better informed about this debate. It also dispels many common myths about Chinese characters and Chinese languages. 

Appropriateness to East Asian Languages -- sample chapter 

========================= 

The first writing systems that evolved were ideographic or pictographic. These kind of writing systems probably were invented independently in two or three places, China being one of them. Subsequently the Sumerians invented the alphabet in about 3,000 BC(???). The idea of the alphabet then spread around the world. It was so successful that it was adopted almost everywhere. Only in East Asia did a character based writing system persist. 

Even in East Asia there has been a trend towards alphabetic writing systems. Vietnam used to use Chinese characters, but abandoned them in favour of romanisation (although the French can probably take some of the credit for that). The Koreans invented their own alphabet (Hangul) and Chinese characters only have a very small place in modern Korea. The Japanese also invented their own alphabetic systems (Katakana and Hiragana) and also use Roman script (Romaji). They maintain the use of Chinese characters in a kind of half and half system. Only in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have Chinese characters persisted in a pure form. 

There are probably a few reasons why characters survived in China. Namely, the conservatism of the society, the low levels of literacy in the general population until recently, and the myth about the unification of Chinese &quot;dialects&quot;. i.e. that although people throughout China spoke many languages they were united by a single written language. 

It is also important to note that the vast majority of Chinese characters are phonemics (although phonetic shifts and variations in pronunciation mean they are not always reliable). They contain a radical indicating the sound and often a meaning radical. Very few characters express the meaning and even when they do it is usually quite abstract. 

There is no reason why pinyin or some other alphabetical system should be more difficult to read than Chinese characters. In fact it should be easier. Even Chinese people sometimes forget how to write a character. With an alphabetical system the worst you can do is make a spelling mistake. 

Basically I can see no good reason for the Chinese not to adopt some form of alphabetical writing system. This doesn't mean abolishing Chinese characters, but simply relegating them to a secondary role.

Know what a &quot;blenny&quot; is? 
Betcha don't. 
Looking it up in your alphabetic phonetic dictionary, eh? 
Yet if you saw the Chinese word for &quot;blenny&quot; you would at least know from the left radical that it's likely a type of fish!

I think we would also have to consider the effects of phonetization on the Chinese written word, literature. Passing down from the style of ??? (wen yan wen), modern literature still retains a bit of the flavor of ? ?. The written word is not entirely a reproduction of the spoken word and the use of single characters is not uncommon. In addition, Chinese is full of wonderful word play which depends at least in part on the hanzi representation of the words involved.

Some people on this thread have mentioned giving Chinese characters a secondary role in the writing system. This would kill them, making them available only to Chinese Scholars. 

I'd be very sad to see the day when Chinese students studied a romanization system to the neglect of Characters. A newspaper in pinyin? Chinese ancestors would roll in their graves. 

I won't argue the fact that Chinese characters are inefficient to learn compared to a phonetic system. That's true. But what I strongly believe is that the most efficient way, the fastest way is not necessarily the best way to do something. I take up this argument for purely cultural reasons. Removing the cultural legacy (in this case Chinese characters which have grown and changed over millenia) of something essentially turns it into something completely different. 

Let me take a different tack to explain that last point. I'm a first generation American citizen (ie. my parents were born in a foreign country and came to the US, where I was born). Like many parents, mine had to decide how much of my cultural heritage they would teach their children (in my case, there wasn't a second language as my parents came from an english speaking country). Some parents make the decision not to teach their children about their heritage and language at all. So then you have a child who is XXXX-American (chinese/japanese/ghanian/polish/whatever) by name only. What does it mean to be a young a Polish-American if you don't know anything about Poland, don't speak Polish, and don't know any Polish History? All it means is that your parents came from Poland. But for all intents and purposes, you're just American. Contrasting that, someone who has learned about their heritage is much richer in that they have generations of history to look back upon as well as their knowledge of American Culture. I see the Chinese language in much the same way, by taking out characters, you're removing the history and the cultural legacy that took so long to create. 

Language is about so much more than efficiency. It's culture; it's history; it's communication. If efficiency and simplicity was truly what was important in a language, then everyone in the world would be speaking Esperanto--the easiset language in the world to learn. I think the governments that use Chinese characters should protect that use at all cost...

By that logic we should all be using Latin instead of English on this board, because of its long history and cultural significance. I don't think any Chinese ancestor would fault a modern person for trying to make things better for themselves or other Chinese-speaking/writing peoples. 

I think the only arguments in favour of the character system are emotional in nature. That said, these emotions are powerful enough that characters aren't going anywhere for a while. I don't hate characters, I just hate the effect they seem to have on the people who are forced to use them. You've got to wonder if a more widely availbile written system of Chinese wouldn't bring with it social change. 

But isn't that one reason why even the CCP didn't banish characters? There are hundreds of dialects in China, different enough to be considered separate languages, but they can all be written using the same set of characters. If you start writing phonectically, you've just removed a unifying factor. Not something which the CCP would relish.

It makes no sense to compare Latin and English with Hanzi and Pinyin (or some other kind of phoentic writing system). Latin and English are two different languages, though many English words derived from Latin. Also Hanzi and the whole Chinese writing system has received a great deal of &quot;improvements&quot; over the years. The three most significant &quot;updates&quot; were, in chronological order, the switch from Wenyen Wen to Baihua Wen, the invention of Zhuyin Fuhao (and later Hanyu Pinyin), and finally the simplication of Hanzi (Simplified Chinese). Note that Zhuyin Fuhao and Hanyu Pinyin were invented to work as aids to Hanzi and not to replace them. So in fact the modern Chinese has made things better for themselves. They have made improvements and updates to the Chinese writing system but not completely change it.

I don't believe *ANY* Chinese person (in their right mind) would like to see China disunified, whether they're from the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, or the oversea Chinese community.

sudasana, this is not correct. Written Chinese is based on the way Mandarin is spoken. To say a Cantonese person can read standard Chinese and it is the same as their language is wrong. The Cantonese person has had to learn to read standard Chinese. This is discussed in the chapter of Asia's Orthographic Dilemma that I linked to in an earlier post. If you are still in doubt just pick up a newspaper in Hong Kong that is written in Cantonese. The differences go far beyond simplified/traditional characters. Indeed there are many characters that are not even used in standard Chinese. 

ChouDoufu, great post, but I still disagree with you. The Vietnamese made the switch from characters to romanisation and do you ever hear them complaining about their culture being lost. The Koreans invented their own alphabet which is a source of cultural pride. If you are really worried about Chinese culture being lost then you should be concerned by the increasing dominance of Mandarin/putonghua at the expense of regional languages and dialects. 

While language is an important part of culture it is also something that, like culture, is continually evolving. Nobody is complaining that typewriters have been superseded by word processors or oil burning lamps replaced by electric lights. Also Chinese do not need to totally abandon characters. If some sort of alphabetic writing system was adopted I am sure that people would still continue to learn some characters and those who wished to go on to higher education would no doubt still become fully literate in characters.

There are actually about 100+ characters that were &quot;invented&quot; just to &quot;write&quot; Cantonese. However, the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese (in writing) is still *MUCH* closer than the difference between Mandarin and other languages that use/used characters, Japanese for example. I've actually been to Shenzhen and saw a Hong Kong magazine that's &quot;written&quot; in Cantonese and I understood it much better than a Japanese magazine I read on a plane.

Actually I have. I live in Houston, TX. We have one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the U.S. (second only to L.A. I believe). I have many Vietnamese friends, some of them even took Chinese at the University of Houston. Many of them took pride in that their culture is so close to the Chinese culture and that they once used Hanzi as well. Almost all of them either learned how to write their names in Hanzi or wish they could. However, I've never seen any of them as ethusiastic about their own language as they are with Chinese, not saying that they aren't proud of their culture in general (which they are). Also there's an Vietnamese organization based in New York who is trying to preserve and hopefully revive the Ngu Nam (sp?) writing system. The Ngu Nam writing system is pretty much Hanzi modified to fit the Vietnamese language. 

Quote:

The Korean culture has become pretty much what you described the Chinese culture should become. While Hangul is used in everyday life, most scholars still learn Hanzi. Also, I heard from a couple Korean students I met in Beijing that they teach Hanzi, or what they call Hanja, in school as well. However, this is only happening because Hanzi is still in full use in Chinese-speaking nations (China, Taiwan, Singapore, oversea Chinese communities... etc.). If China dropped the usage of Hanzi, I seriously doubt that Korea would even bother with it. In the end, Hanzi would just be lost completely.

Are you suggesting that the spread of Mandarin and having a unified standard language is a bad thing for China? I don't believe a large nation can be and remain powerful without a standard language. Usually foreigners in the U.S. are frowned upon when speaking their native language in public because Americans feel threatened. Don't get me wrong though, I am totally for preserving Chinese dialects but I believe everyone should be able to speak Mandarin (even as a second language).

I agree there is a need for a common language in China, but problems arise when that language becomes too dominant and marginalises other languages or dialects.

The thing about Vietnam and Korea is that though they were once controlled by China, they maintained a seperate cultural identity. As a way of exploring this cultural identity, Korea developed their writing system. That's a natural progression for a culture to want a system that it created, not a system that was forced upon it. 

I am very concerned by the loss of regional languages and dialects. Not just in China, but also around the world (many Native American Languages have fewer than fluent 60 speakers-- these languages unfortunately won't survive). I view diversity as something that makes everyone better off, so the loss of these languages is a loss for humanity. But I don't believe the disappearence of these dialects can be blamed only on the &quot;dominance of Mandarin&quot;. Many languages are fading because the younger generation doesn't see the need to speak it. It's not useful; it's not cool; it won't get you a job. I feel both situations (trying to replace Chinese characters, and the disappearence of local dialects) are symptoms of the same problem, a desire in humans to fit in, to be the same, to not stick out. Rather than just accepting the fact that Chinese Characters are difficult but that it's a perfectly valid method, people (and I'm mostly reading stuff by and from non-native speakers) who don't like the system are trying to change it into something more like their own. [it's a ridiculous analogy, but: Some people try to change another person's behavior because it doesn't fit it, because it's different, rather than just accepting a person for who they are.] I'm not a fan of any movement to remove distinctness from cultures. 

Quote:

And maybe not. I still believe that most people wouldn't learn the characters, so you'd end up with a small minority who did and Chinese Characters would be lost to the Chinese people. I base this belief off the fact that in America, a higher and higher percentage of &quot;old works&quot; are getting translated into English. Many classes read Shakespeare in english, not Shakespearean-english. Many more read Chaucer in english rather than middle english. Very few read Beowulf in it's original form. There is the belief that they are too hard and so aren't worth learning. But here is where I disagree again. Yes it's more difficult than standard english, but I feel that the look back into the past provides some intangible benefit. It links people with the past and enriches them whether they realize it or not. People are inevitably looking for the way to do the most with the least amount of effort, and if you remove characters from newspapers, and everyday life then you will kill them for the majority of Chinese people. 

Again my two points: 1) Holding onto cultural links, cultural identity, and diversity are essential. and 2) Simplification does not necessarily mean better.

I don't believe the problem is that serious yet. I've been to many parts of China, mostly on tours but I have stayed for an extended period of time in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. When I was in Shanghai, the locals usually speak Shanghaihua with each other and only Mandarin to non-Shanghairen. Same with Shenzhen, Cantonese is still the dominant language/dialect though most people spoke Mandarin fluently as well. Not only is the Uyghur language spoken in Xinjiang but it's also written alongside with Hanzi on all public signs, whether government-owned or private. Same with Yunnan, all the ethnic minorities I saw still speak in their own native languages (and even taught us some). 

If we have to worry about a single language being too dominant it should be English. Not only is it the dominant language in the U.S. (just like ChouDoufu said, many second-generation Americans don't even speak their own language) but it's also gaining dominance in the world.

Oh yes, and what about newspapers. Is it not correct that &quot;newspaper-hua&quot; ;-) is sort of a foreshortened version of baihua, or a mixture of baihua and wenyan which is highly dependent on the use of hanzi for clarity?

I don't think I have much else to add to this discussion, but I just wanted to clear up those two points. However you feel, characters are here and in use, and we've all got to live with them. As my 1st year Chinese teacher said; ?????????? Or something like that; it's been a while.

English, French, Indonesian and dozens of other languages also use the same &quot;signs&quot; for writing... but this doesn't mean the written languages are the same. Sure ? means big regardless of whether something is in Cantonese, Taiwanese or Mandarin, but many alternative characters are used in writing other languages plus the syntax is often completely different. However, maybe this is getting off topic.

Classical Chinese is very different from modern standard Chinese. Additional modifications to the way Chinese is written would be needed if characters were abandoned in favour of a phonetic script, although these modifications would not be so great. The main change would be that when writing characters a single character can often be used to replace poly-syllabic word. Although any text that could be understood when read aloud could be phoneticised directly.

I believe you misunderstood what I meant. Of course, even native speakers need to acquier at least the basic understanding of the Chinese language. However, once a person has acquired a good amount of Hanzi, he or she would start noticing that they can guess the meaning of a word without having learned it, and by word I mean &quot;ci&quot;, not &quot;zi&quot;. Since most Chinese words (ci) are made up of zi, one can guess the meaning of the ci if he or she knows the meaning of the zi which makes up the said ci.

One of the arguments I've heard from some Americans is that the Chinese character system makes collation, cataloging, and retrieval of documents cumbersome at best. I think the advent of computer has taken care of that problem however. As near as I can tell, with computer encoding of characters, these archiving tasks are accomplished without significant problem.

OK, that makes more sense. Then again, you can do that in English too. The prefixes, suffixes, and affixes are more mishy-mashy but you can still make good, educated guesses as to what words mean, and usually be right. But hearing the Chinese compound words spoken should have the same effect as reading the zi strung together to make up a word. As a matter of fact, that's how I learned a lot of the words I know that were not in my textbook...by listening, hearing compound words made up of words I already know, and using basic logic. 

It is a lot easier to do in Chinese, too. Chinese is much less messy than any IE language! 

The radicals in Chinese writing help decipher the meaning of a zi, but they don't necessarily give a meaning...example: the character for &quot;gasoline&quot;, if I remember correctly, and my reading skills are shite so please bear with me, is the water radical paired with the &quot;qi&quot; (essence, air, spirit) character, which makes sense when you know the meaning and can do some reverse &quot;explain why this happened&quot; hindsight logic, but not if you don't already know the meaning of it.

Many of these prefixes, suffixes, and affixes came from Latin, which is a whole different language. Also, many English vocabularies actually came from other languages as well. English is much like Japanese, where the language is deeply affected by another. Chinese, however, has *mostly* been developed on its own, therefore to truly understand Chinese, one doesn't need to learn another language.

I'm new to this board, just read it allo through for the first time - really interesting. I have two points, one based on a practical argument and the other a cultural one. 

1) something that has not yet been mentioned on the board is the effect of the increasing use of computers versus pens and pencils when writing/typing chinese in everyday life. 

One effect of this trend is the declining ability of the Chinese themselves to physically write the characters as they are so used to typing in pinyin using software such as NJStar. Any foreigner who has studied Mandarin knows that being able to read a hanzi and being able to write a hanzi are two very different things and personally I find typing Chinese with a computer (typing in pinyin which converts into hanzi) incredibly easy. The &quot;written chinese is so difficult to learn&quot; argument for moving to a purely phonetic system is somewhat mitigated by the fact that writing on a computer makes it so much easier. The development of such computer software has made learning and using Hanzi in everyday life much easier as you can get away with a less than perfect memory of all the characters. 

2) I'm with Choudoufu on the cultural argument. Language is culture. Language is history. And you get so much more meaning from characters than phonetic alphabets. For example, the character for &quot;tired&quot; namely &quot;lei&quot; is made up of radicals symbolising silk and a field. In ancient times the men used to plough the fields and the women used to make silk. In doing so they got tired. So &quot;lei&quot; is soooo much more than just &quot;tired&quot;. It is a window on the traditional chinese agrarian way of life. It hints at the dominance of silk production in the Ancient Chinese economy. Its not just a boring, efficient and purposeful &quot;word&quot;. The same goes for &quot;hao&quot; comprising of the radicals for a woman and a child. For a chinese several thousand years ago, &quot;good&quot; was a woman who had got pregnant. I could go on and on... 

So, I think the advent of computers makes chinese far more efficient and for us waiguorens far easier to write. In addition, I am of the opinion that Hanzi make the Chinese who they are, and contain meaning going far beyond their obvious beauty. 

Cheers, Jon

I picked up Hanyu Pinyin in a matter of days because I couldn't find a keyboard that has Zhuyin Fuhao marks. After typing Chinese with Hanyu Pinyin for over five years, I've started to feel that my &quot;writing&quot; skills has decreased, thoguh my reading skills stayed the same, if not improved. However, during the same time, I've also started typing English increasingly (thanks to those darn papers) and my handwriting in English has decreased as well. Not only does my handwriting in English has become more sloppy but also my spelling skills has decreased due to the reliance on spell check. Therefore I believe the negative effect of the increasing usage of typing doesn't apply to just Chinese but almost any language.

I've moved the recent posts on Chinese Character Input Methods to a new topic in the Textbooks and Resources forum, shortly to be renamed the Textbooks, Resources and Computing forum. 
http://www.roddyflagg.34sp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=211 

The posts on the difficulty or otherwise of learning Chinese are now in a new topic in this forum.

Kulong's query as to why some of us learn Hanzi if we hate them and responses to it have also been split 
http://www.roddyflagg.34sp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=213 

This thread is getting so long it would be hard for a newcomer to digest - it would be a good idea to keep posts on the topic of Characters vs Phonetic writing systems - otherwise, please start a new topic. 

Thanks for everyones contributions to this topic - I've reviewed them all in the process of moving the above posts around, and I should probably go and read them in more detail when I have time. Keep them coming . . .

&gt;&gt; Characters by any stretch of the imagination.

&gt; The major writing system in Korea is called Hangul.  It is a
&gt; syllabary -- each symbol represents a particular syllable.  This
&gt; means it has a lot more characters than English (which builds
&gt; syllables from multiple characters), but nowhere near as many as
&gt; traditional Chinese writing, in which a symbol corresponds to a
&gt; particular word.

&gt; Hangul has exactly 140 characters.  Each of these is a consonant +
&gt; vowel combination.  There are also separate symbols for the
&gt; consonants (of which there are 14) and the vowels (of which there
&gt; are 10).

The unicode standard provides, for Hangul Jamo (the consonant and
vowels combined to make the 10K plus Hangul) 96 noncombinable, of
which only 51 are in use as modern letters, and what's called the
Hangul Jamo combining alphabet, with 60 (0x1100 - 0x1159) initial
consonants, 66 (0x1161 - 0x11A2) vowels, and 82 (0x11A8 - 0x11F9)
final consonants...

The standard states that the compatibility section is the portion
of Hangul Jamo that cannot be algorithmicly decomposed to normal,
standardized Jamo.

Of the Hangul Jamo letters, 19 leading, 27 trailing, and 21 vowel
characters are listed as being in common modern use.  That's much
more than 14 consonants and 10 vowels, and results in a total set
of 11,172 complete Hangul in modern use.  That's not counting the
Hangul produced by the less standard 51 Jamo or the degenerate or
unused products involving one of the remaining other 140 odd Jamo
in the normal block.  The Johab set (the 11K formed sylables) are
unquestionably going to be typed using combined keystrokes.  With
a shift or control key, I'm sure all modern Jamo could easilly be
typed with one stroke.  It may even be possible to automate parts
of each Hangul in sequence - initial jamo, vowel jamo, and final,
if present, spacebar (maybe) to move on if not.  I don't know how
it's actually done, but that would seem a sensible approach...

What you describe sounds closer to Hiragana, which has (really) a
total of fourteen consonants (five accessed only by accents added
to similar sounding consonants, eg ka -&gt; ga, ha -&gt; ba -&gt; pa), but
only five vowels, with a few others formed by combining vowels to
get long forms (&quot;yaw&quot; would be ia -&gt; &quot;eee&quot; + &quot;ah&quot;) and a few sets
of combining sounds are neglected (y is only &quot;yah&quot;, &quot;yoo&quot;, &quot;yoh&quot;;
w is only &quot;wah, &quot;woh&quot;; tsu replaces &quot;too&quot;, chi replaces &quot;tee&quot;, ji
replaces &quot;zee&quot;, and there is a vowelless &quot;n&quot; that doesn't start a
new word, but can end one), and the vowels exist as unadorned but
seperate characters.  There's also a rare case of a plain u &quot;ooh&quot;
getting accented to become a vu &quot;vooh&quot;, but I've only seen it one
or two times, ever.

Mind, there's also a complete parallel alphabet, Katakana, with a
slightly different, less fluid shape, used for foreign words, and
a majority of Nihongo is written in Kanji, which is analogous to,
and ultimately derived from, Han ideographs, the chinese writing.
Clasical writing is in Kanzi, which retains archaic flourishes, a
bit like gothic scripts in english.

Korean was, until sometime in the last century, also written with
a Han derived ideographic form.  Several of the nonstandard Jamo,
ultimately, reflect that root.  Purely Han derived characters are
called Hanja and look just like Han.

Again, I don't know how that would be handled in Korean typing.

What gets particularly complex is the integration of dictation in
a combined phonetic/ideographic typed environ.  Worse still, when
dealing with Han (pretty much the last pure ideographic language)
there are actually multiple spoken languages mapped to one print,
and the only phonetic standards format is something refered to as
BoPoMoFo.  It isn't used in writing, but does provide for a basic
standard mapping from phonetic (keep in mind that this includes a
set of tonal elements used for differentiation of meaning) to Han
for a given language.

If a MMOG were to attempt to support, on the same server, a large
set of languages, written and spoken, it would have to overcome a
great deal of incompatibility between languages.  Were the goal a
more modest portability - single release of software, but servers
for each language supported - it would simply be a case of having
operating system support tie-ins and (probably) internal unicode, 
or at the very least multilingual encoding, support.

If it also had voice input support, or even worse, mixed mode and
unified presentation (recipient chooses to see text or hear voice
independant of what originator chose to use), something better in
the way of phoneme encoding would have to be developed, and there
would have to be a pretty advanced context-aware mapping resolver
figuring out what each phoneme-set was *supposed* to mean... just
as much, figuring out which _word_ a given ideographic symbol was
meant to be, not to mention unmangling typos and horrific typing,
u know, 2 b kewl?

I'd like to propose now, should anyone ever do this, that l33t be
translated to a spoken form that resembles an especially retarded
hillbilly just after a run-in with a large mallet.  Or Elmer Fudd
just after getting shot with his own rifle.

Korean is the easiest alphabet in the world to learn.  It's
phonetic.  With a few exceptions, it's logical and sounds exactly
like it's written.  Each one of those blocks contain King Sejong
created it around the 1500s in order to improve literacy rate,
because Chinese language is too hard.  In many people's opinion, he
(or whoever he's taking credit from) did a good job.  It has nuances
too.  It's vowels have yin or yang, each one is male or female.
Some of the consonants are ideograms related to the position of the
mouth to make the syllable.

The standard Korean keyboard map is intuitive.  Korean has more like
40 common characters when practically used, so all can be typed on a
western keyboard using only the letter keys and the shift key.  The
shift key combos are intuitive.  If you wanted to try the keyboard
map, you could try AsianSuite (http://www.unionway.com), or install
Korean language system if your OS supports it.  However, Korean
language, beyond the alphabet, is a monster for a Westerner to learn
(and vice versa), because it shares no roots.  Western language has
an alien philosophy, grammar, and alphabet from Korean.

Incidentally, I'm ending a four month business stay in Korea, and a
four and a half year job with a Korean company, tomorrow.  For the
last four months, I've seen and typed a lot of those funny symbols.

However Chinese is monosyllabic and the base part of each symbol
represents the phonetic sound.  This is the same, so far as I know,
for all words represented by this sound.  The rest of the word (some
added bits in the upper right, I think) represents meaning or
context modifiers to the symbol to differentiate each word from its
generic phonetic base.

Japanese is odd because it is a polysyllabic language but they
adapted the Chinese writing system for their use, so they have
multiple symbols per word (even for the non purely phonetic writing
form... I can never keep the names straight).

Interestingly enough, the Mayan language is much like Chinese.
There's a book out about the decipherment of Mayan that's
fascinating, if you're interested in that sort of thing.

&gt; Actually, there's a pretty good article in the latest Wired (&quot;The

&gt; Korean players actually do talk while playing, as they tend to
&gt; group up based on being in the same 'internet cafe'. It's a very
&gt; interesting read if you get the time.

It was an interesting read and only goes to support my theory that
players want to communicate verbally.  Well, South Korean players,
anyway.  The South Koreans are very social players and they like to
play together in the same room.  As you mention, groups of players
tend to take over an Internet cafe in order to play Lineage as a
group and they don't message each other - they yell at each other.
This is a model that I've speculated on for American gamers so that
we can socialize effectively during gameplay, but we're a different
society.  It might just be a bad idea for Americans.

The Bandwidth Capital of the World

In Seoul, the broadband age is in full swing - online games have
become a national sport, and cybercafes are the new singles bars.

By J. C. Herz

AT FIRST GLANCE, Seoul seems like just another sprawling metropolis:
Its buildings, hastily constructed with dubious financing in the
months leading up to South Korea's 1997 economic crisis, are the
sort of blocky, concrete-and-glass high-rises that give many modern
cities the air of prefab homogeneity. Wide boulevards are choked
with the oppressive traffic common in East Asia or, for that matter,
Silicon Valley. Megamalls and underground shopping centers filled
with Body Shops and Burger Kings cater to teens and young
professionals. There's none of the high tech visual overload you see
in Tokyo, or the clean-scrubbed, old-meets-new urbanism of
Scandinavia - nothing to indicate that Seoul is the most wired city on the planet.

Burrow a bit, though, down the alleys, up flights of stairs, or into
the corners of malls, and you find something that sets Seoul apart
and fosters its passion for broadband: online game rooms, or PC
baangs, as they are called here. There are 26,000 of them, tucked
into every spare sliver of real estate. Filled with late-model PCs
packed tightly into rows, these rabbit warrens of high-bandwidth
connectivity are where young adults gather to play games,
video-chat, hang out, and hook up.

They are known as &quot;third places&quot; - not home, not work - where teens
and twentysomethings go to socialize, to be part of a group in a
culture where group interaction is overwhelmingly important. As
elsewhere, technology scratches a cultural itch. It is the social
infrastructure, as much as the hardware and software infrastructure,
that's driving the statistics.

And the numbers are impressive - South Korea has the highest per
capita broadband penetration in the world. Slightly more than half
of its households have high-bandwidth connections, compared to less
than 10 percent in the US. The growth in broadband has surged in the
last three years from a few hundred thousand subscribers to 8.5
million.

When it comes to rolling out bandwidth, South Korea's population
density is an advantage. Seventy percent of its citizens live in the
seven largest cities, in residential towers nestled close to DSL
switching stations. The capital city of Seoul itself accounts for a
quarter of the population. To put this in perspective, consider that
South Korea's national communications backbone consists of 13,670
miles of optical fiber. Last year, Verizon laid down 20,500 miles of
optical fiber in West Virginia alone. This fact doesn't make the
Korean information infrastructure any less impressive. But the
country does have an easier job on its hands than say, Indonesia, or
the Philippines, or Mexico.

As luck would have it, urban apartment dwellers have a lot of
broadband capacity right under their noses, courtesy of Kepco, the
public power utility, which developed a network of fiber-optic
cables for its own use years ago. In 1996, South Korea allowed Kepco
to lease the unused 90 percent of its capacity, giving upstart
providers a cheap, instant last-mile solution. Sharp competition
with Korea Telecom, which the government forced to open its network
in the early '90s, has driven broadband prices down to the world's
lowest levels. All-you-can-eat service is available for as little as $25 a month.

The government has even set up a certification program to rate
buildings based on the quality of their data lines. Developers who
install fatter pipes take the opportunity to bump up their prices -
not an insignificant policy in a country where 50 percent of the
population lives in large apartment complexes. Fast connections are
even getting bundled into the rent, as construction companies
repackage minuscule high-rise people-boxes as cyber-apartments. (A
typical four-bedroom is 1,150 square feet and costs $2,000 a month,
not counting utilities, cyber or otherwise). Built by conglomerates
like Daelim Industrial and Samsung in partnership with broadband
carriers and content providers, the sales pitch is oddly reminiscent
of 1950s American suburbia - except that instead of lawns and trees,
developers promise an endless expanse of bandwidth allowing
residents to buy flowers, chat with neighbors, and search for the
perfect kimchi recipe on the local Ethernet. It's all very Epcot.

DESPITE THIS UTOPIAN vision of e-domesticity, the real allure of
high-rise broadband is escape from the constraints of real
estate. Escape into the wide horizons of a computer game, or into
the welcoming company of other micro-apartment dwellers - preferably
at the same time. Not only is South Korea a more wired country than
the US, it is also a more gregarious one. Even if most Koreans had
an American-style mega home-theater cocoon, they would still go
out. These people do not bowl alone, particularly if they're single
(most don't move out of their parents' place until they get
married). They want to be with their friends.

And right now, the place to be with your friends is a PC baang in
downtown Seoul upholstered in Romper Room hues. A hundred monitors
glow with the candy colors of computer games. There are also a
handful of &quot;love seat&quot; stations, outfitted with two computers and a
double-wide bench. Theoretically, this is so guys can play
videogames while their girlfriends video-chat with pals.

If you really watch the love seats, though, it becomes apparent that
they're not so much a porch swing as an Internet-mediated bar
stool. Every so often a girl will saunter by one of the stations,
eye the occupant, and then sit down - or not. As it turns out,
singles are video-chatting in game rooms all over town. If they hit
it off, the guy says something like, &quot;I'm sitting at love seat
number 47 at this particular PC baang, if you'd care to join me.&quot; If
the girl is sufficiently intrigued, she hops on the subway or walks
- nothing is more than 20 minutes away in central Seoul. She cruises
by, checks him out, and if she likes the look of him in person she
sits down, hoping the lighting and shading algorithms she used to
enhance her features in the video chat don't make her seem
unglamorous in person.

Young-Baek Kim, 50, the proprietor of this PC baang, spends his days
watching these scenarios play out. A former pharmacist, Kim used to
work in a PC baang as a second job. Now he's the boss, and the
business has expanded to seven locations staffed by his aunt, uncle,
and cousins. Overhead is low, and margins are high - two years ago,
South Korea's PC baangs raked in $6 billion. They are a great
small-business opportunity.

But they are also the product of a huge business crisis. In 1997,
when the Korean economy imploded, thousands of middle managers were
laid off, with no hope of finding new suit-and-tie jobs. They had
tightly knit extended families, though, and as a result, access to
moderate amounts of capital from relatives (the cornerstone of the
nation's small-business culture). A lot of them opened PC baangs -
it cost the same as opening a restaurant, and it was less
sweaty. Their out-of-work compatriots needed an inexpensive way to
spend time. Tech-savvy students wanted to get out of the house. All
the PC baang owners needed was something to draw people in groups
and keep them paying a buck an hour while laying down extra cash for
sodas and instant noodles.

THAT SOMETHING was online computer games. Because Korea was a
Japanese colony for 40 years, until the end of World War II, it has
had an acrimonious relationship with Japan. The latter's consumer
electronics have traditionally been all but verboten thanks to both
trade policy and cultural resentment. No PlayStations, no Sega, no
Nintendo. As a result, PCs have become the dominant game platform in
South Korea - unlike in the rest of the world, where consoles
rule. And in 1998, with Starcraft the most popular game on the
market, PC baang owners started hosting tournaments to boost business.

That snowball has now reached the bottom of the hill. Starcraft is
not just a game in South Korea, it is a national sport, what
football was in America in the 1970s. Five million people -
equivalent to 30 million in the US - play. And three cable stations
broadcast competitive gaming full-time to a TV audience.

Why watch gaming on TV? Partly for the same reason millions of fans
tune in for golf - if you play, it's compelling to see the pros do
their thing. But largely it's about production values. There is so
much insane enthusiasm staged around an event, it takes on a kind of
obsessive allure - seeing a subject this arcane, broadcast with such
a degree of adrenaline, described in frenzied, masterful detail, is riveting.

As an Enigma-esque theme song introduces the broadcast, a
three-camera studio crew stands by in a PC baang in the basement of
one of Seoul's largest malls. Two opponents decked out in metallic
vinyl armor face each other across flat-screen workstations,
steeling themselves for a five-game session of Kingdom Under
Fire. Dry-ice fog rolls across the floor. As the music builds to a
gothic intensity, YES or NO appears on the TV screen, giving at-home
viewers a chance to vote online for the contestants: Maxim, a
two-time winner from the Cherry Clan, versus Fusion, a rising star
from the Saint Clan. Their faces zoom briefly onto the screen as the
commentator, sequestered in an adjacent room, announces the Korean
equivalent of &quot;Let's get ready to rumble.&quot;

Kingdom Under Fire, like many real-time strategy games, is a mixture
of Tolkienesque imagery and resource allocation. Players micromanage
supply chains staffed by tiny serfs while casting flashy magical
spells to vanquish their opponents. Televised games are played in
fast-forward, like speed chess, creating a spectacle of medieval
Europe on Benzedrine: villagers frantically mining, keystone-cop
masons bricking up buildings in seconds, antlike armies on the
march. The excitement builds. The villagers are smelting! Six
minutes in, swarms of little soldiers are wreaking
micromayhem. Flocks of bats and fire-breathing dragons are on the
wing - all accompanied by color commentary and a soundtrack.

The music reaches a crescendo as the challenger finishes off the
defending champion in round one. Cut to a commercial: sexy teens on
the run, snacking on Atlas candy bars. Then the commentators are
back, trading banter and postgame analysis, replaying the highlights
and gearing up for round two. More music. More frenzied medieval
villagers. One hour and 55 minutes later, the defending champ prevails.

&quot;We had a 41 share last week of people who watch cable TV at that
time,&quot; says Chong Il Hun, 32, the lead announcer, who has become a
celebrity TV personality in the three years he's been covering game
tournaments. His station also airs online tutorials - playback
footage of pro players along with voice-over commentary (&quot;In this
situation, I chose to go for the Yamato Gun, as opposed to the Optic Flare&quot;).

Chong points out a 20-year-old in an orange sweatshirt, immersed in
online tactical warfare. &quot;He's a pro gamer. Most of them practice 10
hours every day, like musicians,&quot; he says. &quot;In Korea, people play
games using the Internet like that. It's a kind of boom. It's the
culture, it accelerates things. The first person gets something,
other people get jealous, it spreads to the mainstream.&quot; Seventy
percent of the country's Internet users are also online gamers, as
opposed to 20 percent in the US.

SOUTH KOREA'S hypersocial culture affects how people connect in
virtual space. Lineage, a homegrown online world, is a testament to
the overlay of virtual and physical environments. It hosts more than
3 million players. On any given night, 150,000 of them are signed on
simultaneously. Most play from PC baangs, which buy Lineage access
for 20 cents an hour and sell it for a dollar, but an increasing
number - those with wives and families - pay $25 a month to
subscribe from home.

Like its Western counterparts EverQuest and Ultima Online, Lineage
is a role-playing game set in the Middle Ages. Based on a comic
book, the story involves the efforts of an evil king's stepson (the
rightful heir) to rally a group of faithful followers (the Blood
Pledge) and topple the usurper. In practice, it unfolds like a
massively multiplayer king of the hill. The goal is to capture the
castle, which allows you to raise money by levying tariffs on chain
mail and mead. That enables you to buy more weapons and recruit
soldiers to guard the castle against the onslaught of other
attackers who want to do the same thing. Competing Blood Pledges -
large gangs of players that can number in the hundreds - lay siege
to one another's castles for hours at a time on fat broadband
connections that allow the battles to play out in full glory.

What makes Lineage a distinctively Korean experience is that when
players assemble to take down a castle, they do so in person,
commandeering a local PC baang for as long as it takes. In the
middle of a battle, these people aren't text-chatting. They're
yelling across the room. Platoons sit at adjacent computers,
coordinating among themselves and taking orders from the Blood
Pledge leader. Lineage has a fixed hierarchy, unlike American
role-playing games, in which leadership structures emerge
organically. At the outset, you choose to be either royalty or a
commoner. If you're a prince or princess, your job is to put
together an army and lead it. If you're a commoner, your job is to
find a leader. You pledge loyalty and fight to take over castles,
and no matter how great you are at it, you can never be in charge.

This kind of tightly defined clan structure, which mirrors the
Confucian hierarchy of Korean society, would be anathema to American
players, who generally want to be the hero-king Lone Ranger. &quot;In
Korea, everyone is very comfortable with taking on subordinate
roles,&quot; says Richard Garriott, who created Ultima and now runs the
US division of Lineage's developer, NCsoft. &quot;Their groups are
extremely well structured, to the point where they march in lines,
attack in waves, and have a style of coordination that you could not
possible match in the United States.&quot;

Arguably, it is the tight-knittedness of Korean society, and its
people's tendency to physically gather around technology, that makes
Lineage and the PC baangs a success. Unsurprisingly, Lineage hasn't
taken off in North America, partly because it's a game in which not
everyone can be the boss. More fundamentally, the distance between
Americans, physically and socially, makes it impossible to replicate
the contagiousness of the game, which is also the contagiousness of
PC baangs in South Korea and of broadband overall in the country. In
the US, going online is not generally a group social experience and
almost never a face-to-face social experience - in fact, we presume
that if you're online, you're not talking to someone who's in the room.

The merging of virtual and physical space has huge implications, not
just for the players but also for the way companies operate and
where their costs are carried. NCsoft has only a few dozen
customer-service reps to deal with 3 million gamers. Why? Because if
a guy in a PC baang has a question, he can turn to someone next to
him and ask &quot;What is this about?&quot; or &quot;How do you do that?&quot; If the
person doesn't know, there's always the proprietor, who's been
trained by NCsoft to troubleshoot. Afterward, not only has the
question been answered, but the person who asked it is that much
more of an expert, in case the player next to him ever has the same
question. Essentially, customer support has been completely
decentralized, because players help one another - and also market to
one another. Buzz across the room sells broadband better than any
targeted advertisement can.

IN THE US and Europe, where media companies are obsessed with
pumping copyrighted content into living rooms, online games are not
acknowledged as the market driver for broadband. But in other parts
of the world, especially where population density is high and PC
game rooms are giving millions of people their first taste of
connectivity, online games are becoming the hottest high-bandwidth ticket in town.

&quot;We're talking to Singapore, Thailand, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South
America,&quot; says Heo Hong, NCsoft's CFO. In Taiwan, there are a
million Lineage players, most of whom play from home. In Japan,
NCsoft has a joint venture with Yahoo! and Softbank to package
Lineage as a subscription service. Last year, the game launched in
Hong Kong. This year, a Chinese partner will roll it out in Beijing.

In Asia, where copyright law is only loosely enforced, massively
multiplayer online games are less risky for media developers than
movies, music, TV programs, or console games. Unlike freestanding
content, online worlds are almost impossible to pirate. Someone
could copy the client application, but the game itself lives on a
centrally maintained network. Even if that person were able to
duplicate the backend system (it costs millions to run Lineage as a
reliable service), there is no way to replicate the presence of 2
million people and the dynamics that occur in a human system of that
scale. The value isn't bound up in the content. It's bound up in the
interactions - in the group experience.

South Korea's broadband commons challenges North American
assumptions about what bandwidth is for and why it's relevant. In
the US, cable, telephone, and media companies spin visions of
set-top boxes and online jukeboxes, trying to &quot;leverage content&quot; and
turn old archives into new media streams. There is a profound fear
of empowering consumers to share media in a self-organizing way on a
mass scale. Yet this is precisely what makes South Korea the
broadband capital of the world. It's not a futuristic fantasy that
caters to alienated couch potatoes; it's a present-day reality that
meets the needs of a culture of joiners - a place where physical and
virtual are not mutually exclusive categories.

When NCsoft, originally a systems integrator, decided to move into
broadband media, it could have chosen to distribute &quot;webisodes,&quot; or
online animation. After all, South Korea is the third-largest
producer of animation after the US and Japan. Instead, NCsoft's Heo
says, the company &quot;wanted to focus on interaction. And what is more
interactive than games? We made this market. We made new
sectors. American media companies were just using online capacity to
distribute offline media.&quot;

So what about those of us in channel-surfing American cocoon-land?
The vision of streaming media piped into the home, video-on-demand
24/7, and needle-narrow target markets is heralded as the way
forward. Yet it is possible that this vision is holding us
back. Perhaps the real market opportunities have nothing to do with
connecting people to the Universal back catalog and everything to do
with connecting people to each other. If Seoul is any kind of
signpost, the way forward does not lie in the single servings of
media we consume but in the playgrounds we share - no matter who's
manning the turrets and storming the castles.

Course descriptions and other information are available each spring from the Coordinator of Graduate Studies. 

Degree of Master of Arts 
Applicants must have at least a B+ average to be considered for admission. Applicants whose academic background does not include courses in introductory phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax are normally not admissible. If the applicant's academic background is limited to these courses, or the equivalent, consideration may be given for admission to a two-year program. 

The M.A. program includes courses LIN 1121H, 1131H, 1181H, 1290Y, and JAL 1145H, or their equivalents, if not already taken, plus other requirements as determined by the Department. LIN 1290Y is taken in the final year of the degree. LIN 1121H, 1131H, and 1181H are normally taken in the first year. Students will be admitted to a one-year (normally four course) or two-year (normally eight course) program depending on their background. 

All students must demonstrate an ability to read professionally in two languages other than English. The choice of languages must be approved by the graduate coordinator, having regard to the student's field of research. In some circumstances, demonstrated competence in computer programming may satisfy the requirement. 

Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 
Candidates will be considered for admission if they have completed the University of Toronto M.A. in linguistics, or its equivalent, with at least an A- average. 

Students are normally required to complete three full-course equivalents during the first year. Generals papers (LIN 2201H and LIN 2202H) in two areas of concentration must be completed by September of the second year. During these two years students are normally required to be on campus full-time for a residence period which entails being in such geographical proximity as to be able to visit the campus regularly and to participate fully in the Department's activities associated with the program. 

Language requirements as outlined for the M.A. degree must be satisfied, and other requirements are determined in consultation with the graduate coordinator. 

Candidates are required to present a thesis which must be an original contribution to linguistic knowledge. Both the preparation for and the writing of the thesis will be carried out under the supervision of members of the Department.

I see you've been making some corrections to the [[cookbook:Table of Contents|cookbook]], and I'd like to thank you!  The more eyes checking things, the better the project will be.  If you made any edits before you created your username, ask an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|admin]], and they'll be able to credit your account with the edit.

If you make a comment in a talk page, and you'd like to sign your name, just use three tildies, like this: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  To add a time stamp, just use four of them.

Again, welcome. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 07:43, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Admin==
You are now a [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Wikibooks Admin]].  Congratulations! [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:43, 16 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Cconceicao==
What are your guidelines considering removing links and signatures?

All external links are evil? Just Companies? Or not in the first Page?


:Signatures and email addresses are not supposed to be used in the main namespace. External links are okay, if they point to a free (at least ''gratis''), useful, informational resource relevant to the topic. There is no reason we should ever have a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://www.psd.ro/?coruptie Coruptie]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; link on the Wikibooks portal or a link to hukuki.net anywhere. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 12:19, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)

::Thanks - --[[User:Cconceicao|PTCalex]] 18:48, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== Deleting articles ==

hi

before you delte articles like [[TeXShop]] which have only one or a few links in it, you should check these links. in this case the linked page [[TeXShop: FAQ: Schriften]] is now linked by no other article. you should start deleting in the last element and not in the toplevel ones. --[[User:Moolsan|Moolsan]] 10:08, 26 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Thank you for the help. Im new to this and I think its a great idea.

== Moved Modules ==

Thanks for renaming it. I guess the name I came up with at first; &quot;A Neutral Look on OS's&quot; doesn't quite make as much sense as &quot;A Neutral Look at Operating Systems&quot;. Thanks again for coming up with something better.--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 07:05, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== bot ==

Touching lots of articles is rude. It messes up the history.
What the heck are you planning to do anyway?
:The bot was not supposed to actually edit the articles' history. The goal of touching all the articles was to correct problems with &quot;What links here&quot; image information created when Wikibooks was upgraded from v1.2 to v1.3. I noticed that this wasn't working as it used to in v1.3, so I stopped the bot. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 22:05, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== My interwiki redirect ==

Hi Guanaco,

What was wrong with my interwiki redirect? I know it didn't actually work, but I thought it was a good indicator to other users that I was directing them elsewhere. I'm maintaining only one user page, on Wikipedia, to save the hassle of updating it for every Wikimedia project I'm involved with (mainly Wikibooks, Wikipedia, and Wikimedia Commons). If you have valid concerns about me using a redirect in the way that I did, then I would be happy to replace it with an explicit external link. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 03:21, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Sorry, my mistake. I thought the link actually worked. Never mind; the link is okay. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 03:42, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::That's okay, I needed to write something there anyway. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 04:37, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Adminship ==

BTW, thanks for nominating me for adminship. I don't know if I have a chance yet, but we'll see.;) ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 03:24, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Proposal for policy overhaul ==

As a fellow admin who might be interested, it might interest you that I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as suggested by [[User:Aya]], who claims existing policies to be ambiguous) and more open (as suggested by [[User:Robert Horning]] over the biography debacle).  I've made a post on textbook-l ([http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html]) as a result, please reply to my talk page for feedback. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:53, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

== Sherlock Holmes ==
hey guanaco, are you going to be putting sherlock holmes back up soon? I realize that you wikipedia folks are a bunch of pedantic crazies but I didnt really have any problem with the text so hopefully this isnt a permanent deletion
:It is a permanent deletion. You can repost the Sherlock Holmes text at [http://www.wikisource.org Wikisource]. Wikibooks is for original books and ''annotated'' texts only. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 00:37, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

== Undeletion ==

The modules that you undeleted (Cookbook:Human and Naturism) were deleted again. If you want to open a discussion on undeleting something, could you please use the [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] ([[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion|WB:VFU]]) page, instead of undeleting it? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:16, 19 November 2005 (UTC)
:I undeleted Cookbook:Human because it was already on VFU. [[Naturism]] had been speedily deleted improperly, so I speedily undeleted it. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 07:16, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

== Jokebook ==

I don't think it makes sense to say that if a book on some topic could conceivably be totally rewritten to turn it into a textbook, that makes it valid to keep.  Could we have a valid textbook on humor?  I suppose so, there must be a class somewhere on the subject.  But such a book would not be a jokebook.

There is nothing wrong with jokebooks.  There's no reason to abuse this one by turning it into a textbook.  But there's also no reason for us to keep it here on Wikibooks, since it is not a textbook and never will be.

--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:10, 25 November 2005 (UTC)
:The Jokebook seems to be mostly original research (if you can call it that). 90%+ of these jokes are unverifiable, being the original creations of the book's authors or the authors' friends. For that reason, I have changed my vote on VfD. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 22:05, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Cool.  You've known me for a long time.  If you are in a good position to carry my good wishes to Rob, please do so.  I am not sure why he thinks I'm personally attacking him, but I may have overlooked some stray remark I made which was inappropriate.  Any help you can give in resolving this conflict would be most appreciated.  I have deep respect for Rob and regret anything I may have done to offend him.  --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 03:16, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
:I'm not sure I can do much, but I will try to help in any way possible. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 17:53, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

== Japanese:Videogame ==

I see that you deleted all the Japanese:Videogame pages. Can I please have the text to Japanese:Videogame:General back, as I wish to readd it. There is no copyright problem with this page, add it was created after all the delete votes were passed. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gmcfoley]] 00:55, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
:I've restored the page. You might want to copy it quickly before someone else deletes it. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 04:10, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, I got the text. You can delete the page again, I will readd the information to a different page. Thanks, [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 19:52, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

== Crime Textbook ==

I would appreciate a delete vote on this [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion#The Manual of Crime|VfUndelete]]. I think that a vote from you would carry weight and provide some added direction to see Wikibooks back to following its mission. I wrote off wikibooks, but the recent comments on foundation-l have made me reconsider that decision. [[User talk:Trödel|Trödel]] 22:18, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

== I'm still here ==

Thank you, in a small way, for taking down my request for de-adminship.  I'm trying to take a break from the politics of what is going on here, in part to cool my own head down a bit.  I think Jimbo was wrong in many things, and I do feel that there were personal attacks by him against myself.  Foundation-l got particularly blistering for a bit.  I need to bury the hatchet and move on though.  I think Jimbo does have his heart in the right place, and I'll be the first to admit that some house cleaning needed to be done here on Wikibooks.

I'm trying to concentrate on more mundane things including for now [[AP Computer Science]] and my perennial Wikibook that I've been working on seemingly forever ([[Serial Programming|Programming:Serial Data Communications]]).  That is why I came to Wikibooks, and these are very non-controvercial so I don't need to get buried into a bunch of debate over them, generally speaking (I did manage to piss off one user over the serial data Wikibook, however).  When I get back into doing more admin duties, I think I'm going to try and concentrate on pushing [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] and turning it into something worth while.  I also want to clean up the stack of orphaned book modules that have the deadwood of much of Wikibooks that needs to be cleaned up.  Having admin status is not necessary for that strictly, but it will help.  There are close to 200 modules from the days before Wikibooks broke up into multiple languages still here with the majority of that in German.  All of that needs to be deleted eventually.

None of that needs (at least what I've seen so far) any consent from Jimbo nor does it impact his plans for what he has done other than his orphaning a bunch of modules due to how he deleted [[Jokebook]] and [[How to get a date]].  Even that would not really be controvercial other than some admin would have to remember that all Jokebook material would have to be researched and found to make sure it all was deleted.  Wikibooks is particularly awful if the admin doesn't get it all cleaned up on some random page deletion, or even when the &quot;title&quot; page gets modified and a module is accidentally unlinked.

Thank you as well for being active as an admin and in general a good editor/user during this period.  I hope everything settles down a bit and the policies get reworked into something that everybody can agree upon.  It is this issue in particular that I feel needs the support of Jimbo and not arbitraryness for particular content.  If policies can be clarified and worked out completely, things like [[Jokebook]] will be automatically deleted without contention within this community.  The side issue of the relationship between Wikicities and Wikimedia projects is something that is going to come to a head, but I'm not at the moment ready to take on that issue.

BTW, you may want to look at this [http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2005-November/005243.html e-mail message that was just posted on Foundation-l].  I don't understand the implications, but it does affect you and what I've been talking about as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:51, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

== SORBS ==

After discussion with Craig Spurrier I found more reliable tool than SORBS and I will be more careful when blocking IP's. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:09, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:20, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== New pages ==

Huh? Please link me to where I've created pages with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, because I never recall doing that. I think you made the mistake of posting on the wrong user's page. Since you haven't edited in a while, maybe your account has just been hijacked and you gave me a random message. Respond on my talk page if you actually wrote that on purpose. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 02:09, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:Decision making|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[user:Whiteknight/Book Foundry|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Massive Reverts ==

I noticed you massively reverted pages I tagged for speedy deletion that were either broken redirects due to contents being moved to a different project or were unused redirects that don't follow [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|WB:NP]], were unlikely to be used, could only result in false positives when doing a search and seemed to be within the rules for speedy deletion. So why the massive reverts? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 00:29, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
:I didn't realize I reverted to any broken redirects, but I'll delete those as soon as the [[Special:BrokenRedirects]] cache updates. As for the others, I believe it would be best to keep them, because it's possible there are links to them from external sites, such as other Wikibooks projects. There shouldn't be any problem with false positives as long as we delete the broken ones; users who find the redirects in a search will be directed to the target page. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 03:49, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
::Careful! Some of those really ''did'' need to be deleted, because they're redirects to a video game guide that has since migrated to one of the VG wikis. 
::Nice to see you back, but you should really go over some of the recent policy discussions, as things have evolved a bit over the past year or so.--[[user:SB Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[user talk:SB Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
:::The ones that really need to be deleted will show up on [[Special:BrokenRedirects]] and in the next XML dump, and I'll take care of them. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 20:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Wikimanual of Gardening pages ==

...generally should just keep all the transwikied information, since isolating a tidbit just makes them into itty-bitty stubs. The /sowing version was actually a lot better than the /seeds section. Please don't delete materials from the pages of a book that you are not familiar with. 

OTOH, your thoughts would be appreciated on [[Help talk:Transwiki|Wikibooks talk:Transwiki Rules]]. --[[user:SB Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[user talk:SB Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:27, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

== deleting pages moved to other domains ==

Hello Guanaco, I just saw you deleted Spanish Wikiversity pages. They had been moved to a Spanish domain, without the Import option (because then it didn't existed). In order to respect the GFDL, a link to its history page in this domain had been created. Now, with the page deleted, we are violating the GFDL. :O( Be careful with that next times, --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 17:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

::[[User:Javier Carro/es.wikiversity pages to be undeleted]]. I am admin in es.wikiversity. But, at the moment, we only can import from es.wikibooks and meta. If you can recover these pages, I'll request that the import is activated for this domain also. Thank you, --[[User:Javier Carro|Javier Carro]] 08:12, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Jaggery''' is an unrefined crude [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]. It can be made from the sap of the East Indian jaggery palm, or from sugar cane. When made from the jaggery palm, it is often called ''gur'' to differentiate it from the sugar cane product. It is usually sold in solid blocks of a brownish-yellow color, and is used extensively in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] dishes and sweets as well as traditional medicine. It has a much stronger flavor than refined cane sugar, but [[Cookbook:Raw Sugar|raw cane sugar]] may be substituted in many recipes if jaggery is unavailable.

I notice that there's a mixed organization scheme here, unless &quot;law&quot; is an author.[[User:Kukkurovaca|कुक्कुरोवाच]]

== Not Yet Annotated ==

Shouldn't this page have sections &quot;Annotated&quot; &quot;Partially annotated&quot;?  (never &quot;To be annotated&quot; as raw source text should not be here; if someone wants something annotated then they at least should be able to add their own annotations before uploading here)

== Annotation conflict ==

There seem to be two lists of annotated works.  On the Main Page is a link here, but this list is different from the list of annotated works at [[Study guide bookshelf]].


==Cleanup==
I've cleaned up this list, and added notices to all the pages, redirecting readers to texts on wikisource.
[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 00:23, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==

It would be useful to offer some annotated texts as a two column text.  In other words, one column would have the original text, while the other column would have useful notes, ideas, and/or explanations.  This has become prominent in some versions of Shakespeare, for example, where the left page of the book is the original text, while the right side is the original text translated into Modern English.  I would be more than happy to develop a template for this and to help develop some of the texts into this, just let me know what you think. --[[User:Ultimadesigns|Ultimadesigns]] 02:15, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

The following out-of-copyright book has just been posted to Project Gutenberg:

* {{cite book |last=Wood |first=Thomas |title=Practical Grammar and Composition |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/22577 |year=1914 |publisher=D. Appleton and Company |location=New York }}

It's outdated in a number of places, but much of the content is still relevant. So it might serve as a framework for a work on Wikibooks; needing only updates to the obsolete content and some modernized examples and rules of grammar.

[[Image:Octadecanoic acid (stearic).png|right|thumb|320px|Stearic acid, a common fatty acid in animal fats.]]

'''Oils and fats''', also called ''lipids'', are one of the three basic types of [[Cookbook:Calorie|calorie]] sources, the others being [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] and [[Cookbook:Protein|proteins]]. With 9 calories per [[Cookbook:g|gram]] (38 kJ/[[Cookbook:g|g]]), lipids have the highest [[Wikipedia:food energy|food energy]] content of the three. The other two have 4 calories per gram.

In general, the difference between oils and fats is that, at normal room temperature, fats are solid while oils are liquid.  Palm, palm kernel, and coconut oils are exceptions to this rule.

==Role in Human Health==

[[Image:Elaidic-acid-from-xtal-3D-balls.png|right|thumb|320px|Elaidic acid, a common trans-fatty acid.]]

Many lipids are absolutely essential for life, and a minimum amount of dietary fat is necessary to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and carotenoids. However, certain lipids, particularly trans-fatty acids (such as elaidic acid, shown to the right) are risk factors for heart disease, among others, and so should be limited in one's diet.

Humans have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because these fats cannot be synthesized from simpler components in the diet. Most vegetable oils (including safflower, sunflower, and corn oils) are rich in linoleic acid. Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts and legumes (such as flax, canola, walnuts and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

It is claimed by some doctors and nutritionists that a high level of total fat intake contributes to increased risk of obesity and atherosclerosis (the primary cause of coronary and cardiovascular diseases, and the leading cause of illness and death in North America). Others claim that only saturated fats have this effect. Saturated fats have a hypercholesterolemic effect, whereby blood cholesterol levels of both HDL and LDL increase. Many other doctors and nutritionists blame other factors for heart disease, although a strong and reliable connection has been found between trans fat consumption and coronary heart disease, with a substantially increased risk at low levels of consumption (1 to 3% of total energy intake).

Intake of monounsaturated fats in oils is thought to be preferable to consumption of polyunsaturated fats in oils because the monounsaturated fats apparently do not lower levels of HDL cholesterol (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol, versus its &quot;bad&quot; counterpart: LDL). Oxidized LDL is also much more harmful than unoxidized LDL. According to most doctors and nutritionists, keeping cholesterol in the normal range not only helps prevent heart attacks and strokes but may also prevent the progression of atherosclerosis.

==Food Sources for Different Types of Lipids==

The foods listed below each type of lipid contain high concentrations of that lipid.

;Saturated
:Butter, ghee, suet, tallow, coconut oil, and palm kernel oil, dairy products (especially cream and cheese), solid fat on meat, chocolate, and some prepared foods.
;Monounsaturated
:Nuts, avocados, tea seed oil, olive oil. Canola oil is 57%–60% monounsaturated fat, olive oil is about 75% monounsaturated fat, lard is 45% monounsaturated fat, while tea seed oil is commonly over 80% monounsaturated fat. Other sources include grapeseed oil, ground nut oil, peanut oil, flaxseed oil, sesame oil, corn oil, popcorn, whole grain wheat, cereal, oatmeal, safflower oil, sunflower oil, tea-oil Camellia.
;'''Polyunsaturated'''
:Grain products, seafood (herring, salmon, mackerel, halibut, fish oil), soybeans, sunflower oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, flaxseed oil. Foods like mayonnaise and soft margarine may also be good sources, but nutritional facts vary by style and brand.
;'''Transunsaturated'''
:Trans fats make up 2–5% of the total fat in the milk and body of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep), however the vast majority of trans fats consumed today are created by the processed food industry. As such, these fats can be found in many fast foods, snack foods, fried foods and baked goods. Margarine and shortening may also contain high levels of trans fats, depending on their country of origin — for example, Australian margarine is produced by a different method to American margarine and contains no trans fat.

[[Image:Runny hunny.jpg|thumb|right|Honey]]

'''Honey''' is a sweet and viscous liquid produced by bees from the nectar of flowers . The flavor and color of the honey is largely determined by the type of  flowers from which the nectar is gathered. Common flavours of honey include orange blossom honey, tupelo honey, clover honey, blackberry, and blueberry honey. In Australia, Tasmanian leatherwood honey is considered a delicacy for its unique flavour. Manuka honey from New Zealand is said by some to have more healing properties than other honeys, therefore sells at a premium price.

The main uses of honey are in cooking, baking, spreading on bread or toast, and adding to various beverages such as tea . Because honey is hygroscopic (drawing moisture from the air), a small quantity of honey added to a pastry recipe will prevent it from becoming stale. Raw honey also contains enzymes that help in its digestion, as well as several vitamins and antioxidants.  Eating wild honey from near your home can help build up resistance to hayfever and other pollen allergies.

Honey is, however, not always healthy. Because it is gathered from flowers in the wild, there are certain times and places when the honey produced is highly toxic. Rhododendrons and azaleas have nectar that is highly poisonous to humans although harmless to bees, producing deadly honey. In some areas of the world the hives are emptied immediately after the flowering season and cleaned of any residue to prevent accidental poisoning.  Such poison honey is very rarely, if ever, encountered in the United States. The shape of the Azalea flower makes access to nectar difficult for honeybees, and during the time at which Azaleas bloom there are almost always other flowers in bloom that are more appealing to the honeybee.

Honey (as well as other sweeteners) is also potentially extremely dangerous for infants. This is because botulism spores are among the few bacteria that survive in honey. While these spores are harmless to adults, an infant's digestive system is not yet developed enough to destroy them and the spores could potentially cause infant botulism. For this reason, it is advised that neither honey, nor any other sweetener, should be given to children under the age of 18 months.

Honey does not spoil. Because of its high sugar concentration, it kills bacteria by osmotically lysing them. Natural airborne yeasts can not become active in it because the moisture content is too low. Natural, raw, honey varies from 14% to 18% moisture content. As long as the moisture content remains under 18% nothing will grow in honey.

*1 cup of honey = 339g = 1030 Cal = 229g of carbohydrate
*1 tablespoon = 21g = 65 Cal = 17g of carbohydrate
*1 volume unit of honey = 1.67 volume units of granulated cane sugar in equivalent sweetening power.

==Useful tips on cooking with honey==
#As a general guide, when using honey recipes, use less of honey because it is almost twice as sweet as sugar. Replace one cup of sugar for half a cup of honey, and because honey is hygroscopic (meaning it attracts water), reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by 1/4 cup for each cup of honey added. 
#Give longer time for beating and more vigorous beating compared to sugar recipes, and when baking with honey. 
#Add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda for each cup of honey used. This will neutralize honey's acidity and help the food rise. 
#Reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Honey batter becomes crisp and browns faster than sugar batter. 
#When using honey in jams, jellies, or candies, increase the cooking temperature just a bit to allow the extra liquid to evaporate. 
#The floral variety of the honey should be considered when cooking with honey since honey will impart some of its flavor.

The original Old Nol was Oliver Cromwell, 'a great bad man' as Claredon called him. Incidently, he also never lost a battle, his online alter ego cannot say the same.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Old Nol. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Old Nol~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Thanks a lot for continuing work on the wikibook while I have been doing somewhat other stuff. You appear to have been the only editor for a pretty long time! Hopefully the wikibook is basically completed (apart from the dream interpretation part, but nobody knows how to fill that anyway). Oh yeah, I got a new book called ''Dreaming Reality'', which is a rewrite and simplification of ''The Origin of Dreams''. Hopefully I will be able to fill in the dream interpretation section from that. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 11:55, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</text>

Any chance you could cover calling a function by name at runtime as in

 #!/bin/perl
 using strict;
 sub foo
 {
   print &quot;here&quot;;
 }
 
 my $funcname = &quot;foo&quot;;
 
 $funcname();

ps: the above code doesn't work in strict mode. I'm searching for the correct way to do it

: No, the point of strict is to keep you from doing that.  Don't do that.  Don't ''want'' to do that. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 22:51, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

: Actually you can do that, and &quot;There is more than one way to do it&quot;:

 #!/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 sub foo { print &quot;here\n&quot;; }
 my $funcname = &quot;foo&quot;;
 $::{$funcname}();
 {
   no strict qw(refs);
   &amp;{$funcname}();
 }

: On the other hand, these are advanced techniques, those are highly advanced techniques, e.g., for those writing AUTOLOAD functions or writing test suite libraries.  I don't think it is appropriate here. [[User:Isaacto|Ike]] 10:43, 8 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Budgeting''' involves maintaining control over your expenditures. There are typically three phases that show a maturation of a control of your budget.

* Defining - Defining your inflows and outflows to get an idea of your cash flow.
* Setting - Setting your budget to control how much your expenses are each month.
* Improving - Improving your cash flows by reducing your expenses and increasing your income.

==Making a budget==
===Write out your total income===
Include wages, salaries, rent collections, settlements, allowances, or any other source of money you get.

===Write out your fixed costs===
These are the expenses that come in bill form like insurance, car payments, rent or mortgage payments, or payments to any other kind of loan.  Costs like these need to be paid and don't change no matter how much or little you use them.  It is important to get these down first, since these payments are generally out of your control.

===Write out your variable costs===
After you pay your bills, you can now allocate what's left of your income to other things that need to be paid.  Groceries, utility bills, and other costs within your control go here.

==Sample==
=== Monthly income ===
* Primary employment: $1600

=== Fixed monthly expenses ===
* Rent / Mortgage: $300
* Car payment: $336
* Phone: $55
* Kirby: $50
* Insurance: $80

=== Variable monthly expenses ===
* Gas: $80
* Cigarettes: $150

== The basic budget ==
Budgets don't have to be painful experiences. Now that you have a set of realistic goals for all of the money you will be getting and that you have an idea of how much money you will be spending, you can start to budget effectively.

For the first month, just count the ins and outs. You can use a normal notepad for this.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Example (All amounts in US$)
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | August 2005 income
|-
| Income (job) || 4,095
|- 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | August 2005 expenses
|-
| Rent ||1000
|-
| Insurances || 300
|-
| Food ||200
|-
| Entertainment || 100
|-
| Clothes/Diapers || 100
|-
| Phone || 98
|-
| Train || 50
|-
| Credit Card || 43
|-
| Gasoline || 40
|-
| Gas || 34
|-
| Electricity || 20
|-
| Mysteriously Vanishing Money || 165
|-
! Total Expenses || 2,150
|-
| Leftover cash from July || 820
|-
| Leftover cash from August || 520
|}

In August, they had 820 US$ in addition to 4,095 US$ from their income for a total of 4,915 US$. 

They spent 2,150 US$ and had 520 US$ left at the end of the month. They therefore saved 2,245 US$ in August.

Counting the leftover cash in your wallet allows for a precise expenses count even if you forgot to actually count an item or two. The forgotten cash will show up as Mysteriously Vanishing Money (MVM).

Savings were distributed according to the priorities set out in Chapter 1 and were as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| House || 700
|-
| Tuition || 545
|-
| Retirement || 500
|-
| Car || 400
|-
| Travel || 100
|}

In case of unforeseeable emergencies when expenses exceed income, they use their travel money first, then the car money and then the retirement money to pull them out of the scrape. This is not recommended. In fact, an extra savings account for emergencies should ideally be created and hold about 6 months worth of income to deal with the ups and downs of life.

Unfortunately, that is simply not possible for the family in the example above. They must therefore prioritize their needs and perhaps create a tighter budget.

== The revised budget ==

Now that you've thought about how to cut your expenses, it's time to get to it! Some expenses of course are fixed and so cannot be easily cut. In the example below, rental fees are exorbitant but reducing them would entail moving elsewhere... Not a realistic solution. So, what can be cut? Food, ET and the phone bill look like prime targets. Another important one to hit is MVM as it usually represents items which you can do without... after all, you don't remember buying them! Utilities and gasoline are already quite low, so don't need to be taken care of. Gradual cuts may be better than taking out 50% of one item in one fell stroke and suffering through the entire month, only to face the uncontrollable urge to splurge on that item next month. Perhaps cuts of 10% a month would be easier to bear.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | August 2005 income || Target budget
|-
| Income (job) || 4,095 || 4,095
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | August 2005 expenses || Target budget
|-
| Rent || 1,000 || 1,000
|-
| Insurances || 300 || 300
|-
| Food || 200 || 180
|-
| Entertainment || 100 || 90
|-
| Clothes/Diapers || 100 || 85
|-
| Phone || 98 || 88
|-
| Train || 50 || 50
|-
| Credit card || 43 || 43
|-
| Gasoline || 40 || 40
|-
| Gas || 34 || 34
|-
| Electricity || 20 || 20
|-
| Mysteriously vanishing money || 165 || 150
|-
! Total expenses || 2,150 || 2,080
|-
| Leftover cash from July || 820 || 
|-
| Leftover cash from August || 520 || 
|}

Hey, not bad! You have shaved 70$ from your budget. That's a great start. Continue doing this every month until you feel you are living *too* cheaply and yearn for a better life. Then, loosen up a little... just a little! Just enough to feel the difference between extreme poverty and the point where you enjoy life again. So, enjoy life, but on the cheap side!

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A chord is three or more different notes played simultaneously. Chords derive their names from the ''root'' note; so a C chord has C for its root note and a G7 chord will have G. The interval between the root note and the third determines whether a chord is a major or minor. Chords may be strummed or the notes picked individually though beginners find strumming much easier. The more advanced technique of picking is examined in the [[Guitar/Picking and Plucking|Picking and Plucking]] chapter. 

While chords are primarily used for rhythm guitar, basic chord knowledge can be important for lead playing as well. Knowing how chords are constructed can help when learning the lead parts of many songs since there is always a relationship between a chord and the lead part. For example, if you have to play a lead part over a C major chord (C-E-G) and you use the notes of a D flat major chord (Db-F-Ab) then the result will be very dissonant. Additionally, many lead patterns revolve around arpeggios. These are chords with their notes played in sequence (the word &quot;arpeggio&quot; actually means &quot;broken chord&quot;) rather than together. For more information on arpeggios, see the [[Guitar/Arpeggios and Sweep Picking|Arpeggio and Sweep Picking]] chapter.

Chords are easy to play though understanding the theory behind chord construction (harmony) will require some understanding of scales. While it is not essential to have a knowledge of scales to be able to use this section; understanding scales will definitely improve your general musicianship. With that in mind, go ahead and learn and use these chords without worrying too much about the theory and when you have the time take a look at the page on [[Music|general music theory]] and the page on [[Guitar/Scales|scales]].

Beginners are advised to start with [[Guitar/Open Chords|open chords]], which are often the easiest chords to form. Learning open chords is important because it sets the stage for learning how to form barre chords. [[Guitar/Barre Chords|Barre Chords]] are chords you form by pressing all (or some) of the strings down with the first finger. This finger acts as the barre (the same job that the nut of the guitar does when you are playing open chords). Because of this barre chords don't usually include open strings and can be moved freely up and down the neck. As you move your barre chord, the shape of the chord remains the same although all the notes change. Barring is an important technique and greatly opens up the neck of the instrument.

==Different Kinds of Chords==

===Major chords=== 
The most basic chord is called a triad and consists of three different notes. A major triad consists of the root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. The early study of chords should be based around how to build the tonic triad (chord) from any major scale. To build the tonic triad you take the first note of any major scale and the third note (a major 3rd) and the fifth note (a perfect fifth). Take for example building a tonic triad (chord) from the C major scale. If you look at this C major scale:
 
'''C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C'''
 
you will notice that the first, third and fifth notes of the scale are C, E, and G. The most obvious thing that most guitarists become instantly aware of is that the C major played in the first position actually involves playing 5 strings and therefore must have more notes than a triad. The C major chord shown below has these notes C, E, G, C, E. If you cancel out the doubles you are left with a C major triad. This brings us to an important rule: any chord tone (note) can be doubled without affecting the chords designation. Therefore a C major triad (C-E-G) and the first position C major chord below (C-E-G-C-E) are both still C major chords though the 5 note version will sound fuller due to the note doubling. Major chords have a characteristically bright and happy sound.

The minor triad consists of a root, a minor third and a perfect fifth. The interval between the root and third is a minor third and the interval between the root and fifth is a perfect fifth.  Minor chords have a dissonant quality due to the interval of a minor third. It must be remembered that we are talking about building chords from scales and that these intervals, the minor third and perfect fifth, are the interval designations from the scale which are then applied to naming the intervals in a chord. Which is why the triad intervals are not named 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively.

Minor chords are best understood in relation to their major chord counterpart. In the example below we will use E major and E minor. When we play an E major chord, we can flatten the third of the chord by lifting the finger that is holding down the third string at the first fret, making it an open string. By altering this one note so that the interval is changed from a major third to a minor third, we have formed a new chord: E minor.

&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File: E minor chord for guitar (open).png|'''E minor'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

Switching between major and minor chords can be relatively easy, as it involves the change of only one note. Some chord changes, for example changing between an open F major to a F minor, will need a little more effort.

===Dominant Seventh chords=== 
A minor seventh is added to a major chord. When a minor seventh is added to any major chord that major chord is changed into a dominant seventh. The dominant chord always refers to the chord built on the fifth degree of any major scale. Look at the C major scale below:

'''C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C'''

The fifth degree of the scale is G. The chord built on the fifth contains the notes: G-B-D. To change this dominant major chord to a dominant seventh you need to add a fourth note. The note you add is F (the minor seventh) which now makes: G-B-D-F. This chord has very strong need to resolve usually to the tonic. The reason the interval in G-B-D-F is called a minor seventh and not a perfect fourth is that interval designation is determined from the root of the chord being discussed. Take for example the G major scale below:

'''G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G'''

As you can see the interval G-F# is a major seventh. You can form a minor seventh interval by lowering the seventh by a semitone: G-F. This holds true for all major seventh intervals.

At first it seems quite strange looking at the interval relationship of another key to determine the chord intervals of the key you are playing in. With practice it becomes very easy but does involve learning a few major scales.

File:G7 chord for guitar (open).png|'''G7'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

===Sixth chords=== 
Add a sixth to the chord. The two chords below are major chords from the key of C with a sixth added. 

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File:F6 chord for guitar (open position).png|'''F6 (Subdominant in C major)'''
File:C6 chord for guitar (open position).png|'''C6 (Tonic in C major)'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

===Suspended chords===
To form a suspended chord the third is replaced with either a second or a fourth. The third of a chord defines its modality - whether a chord is major or minor. By removing the third and replacing it with a second or fourth you have suspended the chord's modal quality. This creates a chord that is neither major or minor and the ear interprets the chord as harmonically ambiguous.  

Suspended chords derived from a D major chord:

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

Suspended chords derived from the A major chord:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File:Asus2 chord for guitar (open position).png|'''Asus2'''
File: A major chord for guitar (open).png|'''A major'''
File:Asus4 chord for guitar (open position).png|'''Asus4'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

Suspending an E major chord:

&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File: E major chord for guitar (open).png|'''E major'''
File:Esus4 chord for guitar (open position).png|'''Esus4'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

===Slash chords=== 
Chords that are not in root position. For example, a C/G is a C chord with a bass note of G. They are also referred to as &quot;inversions&quot;. Slash chords are always notated with their chord name first followed by the bass note.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File:C major chord for guitar (open position in second inversion).png|'''C/G'''
File:F major chord for guitar (open position in second inversion).png|'''F/C'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

===Diminished chords===
These consist of a stack of minor thirds. You can extend a diminished triad (three note chord) by adding another minor third; which gives you a four note chord called a diminished seventh chord. The diminished seventh chord is notated as Co7 or dim7. Diminished seventh chords are built entirely from minor thirds, so you can move the chord shape up the neck in intervals of a minor third (three frets) and this will be exactly the same notes as the original chord but in a different order. The term &quot;inversion&quot; is used when chords have their notes rearranged.

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File:Edim7 chord for guitar (root).png|'''Edim7 - root position'''
File:Edim7 chord for guitar (third in bass).png|'''Edim7 - 1st inversion'''
File:Edim7 chord for guitar (fifth in bass).png|'''Edim7 - 2nd inversion'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt; 

A half-diminished chord consists of a diminished triad with a major third on top. In other words, a half-diminished chord is a diminished triad with a minor seventh.
 
Diminished chords are full of tension because of the dissonance created by stacking minor third intervals and they are normally resolved to a consonant major or minor chord.

==Presentation==

With the &quot;time&quot; reality check, you see if clocks work.

Other than checking to see if clocks report a logical time, you can try blinking to change the time. Some have more success with a digital than an analog watch, for some it's the other way around.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I looked at the clock. I looked away, then back again. It had jumped forward five minutes. I did it again, just to make sure. It had jumped forward another five minutes. Alright, time to have fun...
* I looked at my digital watch, and read the time. I looked away and back again, and the numbers had changed to symbols. I realized I must be dreaming.
* I woke up from a dream (for real). I looked at my digital alarm clock and noticed that it was 7.10am. Since it was weekend, I didn't feel like getting out of my bed, so I decided to go back to sleep. I fell asleep and I dreamed that I was in my own bedroom. I looked at my alarm clock and noticed the time: 1.30am. I thought: &quot;Wait a minute, just a few minutes ago it was 7.10am, I must be dreaming!&quot;
* I suspected that I was dreaming, so I looked at my watch. It said 6:58. I looked back a second later, and it said 4:48.
* I looked at a digital clock and the time showed something impossible like 9:65, then the segments of the display started flashing randomly.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I looked at the clock, looked away and back again. I couldn't tell if it had changed. My vision was fuzzy, and the digital reading seemed to keep on jumping. I gave up and continued nonlucidly.
* I was already lucid when this started. My mum (or rather a dream character playing her part) came into my room and told me I wasn't dreaming. I decided I'd better double-check and so used my favourite clock reality check. I looked at the clock and away. I looked back again - and the time hadn't changed. I lost lucidity.
* During a false awakening, I looked at my alarm clock (in fact, an old one I threw away some years ago), and it showed something like 1:20am, though I was sure I already woke up at 4am that night. I was starting to think I was dreaming, but I wanted to check the time again. However, I couldn't figure it out, as the hour and minute hands of the clock were of the same length. I thought it was pretty inconvenient, but didn't get lucid. Then, as I was staring at the clock, the hands started spinning faster, like an hour in a few seconds. Still, I didn't get lucid, as I was really trying to read the time, and was too focused on this goal.
* I read a digital clock which said &quot;DU:CK&quot;. I asked my dad and he said this must be advertisement from Chinese restaurant. (in fact, there are no Chinese restaurants near my location, and the clock does not have internet connections, so there can't be any advertisements)

In Spanish, as in many languages, there are two ways of addressing people, one of them familiar and the other formal. In English this is achieved by the use of first names or last names.

''Tú'' is used for people with whom you're familiar. For example, friends and acquaintances would be referred to as ''tú''. So would children, pets, and, usually, all family members.

''Usted'', which is more formal, is used for people older than you, authority figures, strangers, and people you are meeting for the first time. In parts of Colombia ''usted'' is widely used, even among friends.

*Plural
**In most of Spain the plural of ''tú'' is ''vosotros'' and the plural of ''usted'' is ''ustedes''.
**In Andalusia and all of Spanish America, the plural of ''tú'' is ''ustedes,'' i.e., plural second person doesn't differentiate between familiar and formal form of address.

|Friends or acquaintances.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vos''' is a pronoun that was used when the Spanish soldiers arrived to America. In many places it replaces ''tú'' and in some of them is complementary with ''tú''. Its verbal forms are those of ''vosotros,'' but with some sounds missing. Example: ''vosotros coméis'' produces ''vos comés'' (Argentina, Central America), ''vos comes'' (Bolivia), ''vos comís'' or ''tú comís'' (Chile), and ''vos coméi'' (Venezuela).

This is a recipe for a '''Chicken Madras''' (however other meats can be used substituted for the chicken). It is a popular curry in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK]]. ''Serves 4''

==Ingredients==

*4 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
*2 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*4 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 jar of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato puree]] 
*2 teaspoons of ground [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*3 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Garam masala|garam masala]]
*1 teaspoon of ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*1 teaspoon of ground [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*8 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods
*1/2 teaspoon of ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1/2 teaspoon of ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
*juice of 1/2 a [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

==Procedure==
# Find a large saucepan or frying pan which has a lid, place on a medium heat and add a liberal amount of cooking oil and then when at temperature add the two onions finely chopped, cook the onions for a couple of minutes until they start to brown slightly.
# Now add the garlic (finely chopped), ground Cayenne pepper and Garam masala and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.
# Now add the ground cumin, ground turmeric, ground ginger and ground coriander and stir in for about 30 seconds.
# Add the diced chicken and stir until the chicken is cooked through.
# Now add the tomato puree which you will have diluted down 1:1 with water and the seeds from the 8 cardamom pods, stir and then lower the heat and place a lid on the saucepan. Simmer for 30 minutes stirring occasionally (if the sauce starts to stick to the pan add some water)
# After 30 minutes remove the lid and squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the pan along with a pinch of salt, stir and let simmer uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes.
# Serve

Suggestion: Add approx 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder when adding the cayenne pepper to bring the heat up to about a madras where this dish currently sits about a Hot Masala. 

Garnish: fresh chilis, pinch of garam masala, and freshly chopped coriander leaves.

How can we describe the way things move? 

Motion has two basic properties, direction and speed. 

Objects in our universe travel in three fundamental directions. We usually describe these directions, or axes, using the letters x, y and z.  When we are describing motion close to, or with respect to, the Earth's surface we usually align the axes such that the z direction points vertically. Most people will then choose the x axis to point right and the y axis to point forwards (right-handed co-ordinate System).  Motion in any other direction is the same as simultaneously moving in any of these three directions.

Speed is how fast an object covers a particular distance per unit of time. The units of distance are most commonly specified in meters or some power of ten multiple of meters (millimeter, kilometer, etc.), but other imperial units, such as inches  and miles are sometimes used. Nearly everyone uses seconds, minutes, and hours as the unit of time. In scientific reports, seconds are used exclusively.

Together these two ideas form the notion of velocity, directed motion. 

The language we use to describe motion in our universe is the vector, which exists in three dimensions. A vector is similar to an arrow in three dimensional space (i.e. it has a direction associated with it.) You will learn more about this in maths.

:Yes, lets make a multilingual VeganWiki.  Set it up, post the link here, and we will grow something amazing together.

''end moved text''

:: Hmmm... as links seem not to be too welcome here, could you contact us on http://de.veganwiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/VeganWikiWelcome ??

Thanks nevertheless for giving us room and space to network at least on this discussion site :/ -- Tim

:Sorry, didn't mean to seem unfriendly, but we're pretty consistent that discussions about pages belong in the Talk: namespace, and this was starting to become a discussion.  I'll go back and put an external links section on the module, and include a link to the VeganWiki.  Thanks. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 07:47, 22 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:: Thanks :) I now added the Cookbook:VeganCuisine as InterWiki in the German language VeganWiki. Perhaps we could add the VeganWiki to this one as well and translate and interlink recipes... -- DeVeganWiki:Tim

We could set up an English VeganWiki on en.veganwiki.org. Check out http://veganwiki.org/ if you're interested... thanxxxx! Tim

== Policy for denoting vegan recipes ==
I would like to propose a policy for denoting vegan recipes. When a recipe is normally vegan, as in soy milk, only its name should be listed. When the vegan recipe is a special case of another recipe, as in vegan brownies, the recipe name should be listed, with &quot;vegan&quot; in parentheses. Like so:
*[[Cookbook:Soy Milk|Soy Milk]]
*[[Cookbook:Brownies (Vegan)|Brownies (Vegan)]]
This is in preference to &quot;vegan recipename,&quot; since it will assist in indexing and categorization in the cookbook project as a whole. I think.

[[User:Kellen|Kellen]]
:Sounds good to me. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:35, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::I like it. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 15:47, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)


Most of the recipes I have are normal recipes, to which I add vegan variations. Mostly I do this because the original recipe wasn't vegan and it's farily trivial to interchange the ingredients, but I want to make an explicit note that doing it with vegan products works. With respect to the [[Cookbook:Recipes]] listing, how do people think I should denote these:
# [[Cookbook:Cardamom_Bread|Cardamom Bread]]
# [[Cookbook:Cardamom_Bread|Cardamom Bread]] (vegan)
# [[Cookbook:Cardamom_Bread|Cardamom Bread]] (with vegan variation)
I am undecided on this, but I'm leaning towards the 3rd since it's not a proper vegan recipe. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:11, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

----

== this page should be split ==

Part of the page is about the special diet.
Part of the page is a list of recipes.

This page could be split into Vegan_Recipes and Vegan_Diet. --(anon did not sign)

I very much agree. It's a little long and unruly. --[[User:64.231.142.250|64.231.142.250]] 03:01, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

I suggest [[Cookbook:Vegan_Recipes]] and [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions]] for the names. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:25, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Agreed. I'll do it. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:40, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

== category link problem ==

I made a few changes, including trying to make a link to Category:Vegan_recipes, since that's where the recipes are. But it wasn't working for some very odd reason -- the links &amp; linked text simply wouldn't show up at all when I saved, and aren't even now -- hence the full URL on the link on the third bullet, for the time being. (I tried other category pages and they wouldn't work either.)  [[User:Zach Alexander|Zach]] 22:28, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:You make a link to a category like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Category name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which results in this [[:Category:Category name]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:30, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== advertising ==

G'day all,

I removed a bunch of links to specific forms of vegan cheese and milk. I really think if we are going to mention specfic brands then we should do it in a table sinilar to the ones on wikipedia comparing different software and the like. We HAVE to stay NPOV, so we cant go around advertising this or that brand.

It is open to manipulation by companies, and it is also not international, since most of the linked brands are only avaliable in one or two countries. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 13:02, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:: (duplicate of what I put on your talk page:) I added most of those companies (some while not logged in) for the express purpose of people being able to find vegan products. These could perhaps be split off to another page, but I think it's unreasonable to eliminate them. Vegan substitute products are difficult to find and it's even more difficult to find good ones. I am curious about your thoughts on this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:07, 17 May 2005 (UTC)
::: expanding on this: I think that having links to specific products (especially &quot;basic&quot; ones) is important with respect to veganism. Many of these basic things are prohibitively difficult, specialized, or time consuming to prepare (vegan cheese, for example) and it's unreasonable to just note that they exist without providing possibilities for people to find them (vegan substitutes like this are notoriously hard to get a hold of). I do agree that these are country specific, even region-specific, but I don't think there's a solution for this except maybe to denote that they are indeed region specific.
::: With respect to NPOV, I think that the difficulty in finding certain replacements trumps the &quot;neutrality&quot; of a non-mention. I'd like to see this software comparison table you're referring to, as this could satisfy both of our desires here. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:16, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

== Interwiki Link ==

Hi there,
the link to german wikibooks is a almost dead end-
it should go straight to https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kochbuch/_Vegetarische_und_Vegane_Ern%C3%A4hrung -
would someone fix that, please?

==Ingredients==  
*1/3 cup white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], washed
*3 [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnips]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1/4 cup gravy
*8 ounces crushed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]].
*4 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], or vegetable stock

==Procedure==
#Cut three young turnips into slices and put them on a cooking rack, over a cookie sheet, sprinkle with salt, cover them with a dish, and let them stand for about two hours until the water has run out of them.  
#Put the slices in a frying-pan and fry them slightly in butter, until softened.  
#Add the gravy and tomatoes, and after having cooked this for a few minutes pour it into boiling stock.  
#Add well-washed rice, and boil for 30 minutes.

Minestra loses its flavour if it is boiled too long.  In Lombardy, however, rice, macaroni, etc., are rarely boiled enough for English tastes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Environmental Science is a required badge to qualify for Eagle Scout.

==Requirement 1==
:''Make a timeline of the history of environmental science in America. Identify the contribution made by the Boy Scouts of America to environmental science. Include dates, names of people or organizations, and important events.''

==Requirement 2==
:''Define the following terms and describe the relationships among them: population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, symbiosis, niche, habitat, conservation, threatened species, endangered species, extinction, pollution prevention, brownfield, ozone, watershed, airshed, nonpoint source, hybrid vehicle, fuel cell. .''

*A [[w:population|population]] is the collection of people, or organisms of a particular species, living in a geographic area.
*A [[w:community|community]] is a social group of organisms sharing an environment, normally with shared interests.
*An [[w:ecosystem|ecosystem]] is a community of organisms (plant, animal and other living organisms - also referred as biocenose) together with their environment (or biotope), functioning as a unit.
*The [[w:biosphere|biosphere]] is part of a planet's terrestrial system— including air, land and water— in which life develops, and processes in turn transforms.
*[[w:Symbiosis|Symbiosis]] is an interaction between two organisms living together in more or less intimate association or even the merging of two dissimilar organisms.
*A [[w:niche|niche]] is the position of an organism or group of organisms within an ecosystem or the conditions making a habitat.
*A [[w:habitat|habitat]] is the place where a particular organism usually lives or grows.
*[[w:Conservation|Conservation]] is an ethic of resource use, allocation, exploitation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining the health of the natural world: its forests, fisheries, habitats, and biological diversity. Secondary focus is on materials conservation and energy conservation, which are seen as important to protect the natural world.
*[[w:Threatened species|Threatened species]] is an animal or plant species under a serious, but perhaps not imminent, threat of extinction.
*An [[w:endangered species|endangered species]] is a species whose population is so small that it is in danger of becoming extinct
*[[w:Extinction|Extinction]] is the disappearance of a species or group of species.
*[[w:pollution prevention|Pollution prevention]] is an activity that reduces the amount of pollution generated by a process, whether it is consumer consumption, driving, or industrial production.
*[[w:Brownfield land|Brownfields]] are properties with real or perceived environmental contamination that cause a barrier to redevelopment.
*[[w:ozone|Ozone]] is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic O&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Ground-level ozone is an air pollutant with harmful effects on the respiratory systems of animals. The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere filters potentially damaging ultraviolet light from reaching the Earth's surface.
*[[w:watershed|watershed]] the region drained into a river, river system or other body of water.
*An [[w:airshed|airshed]] is a part of the atmosphere that behaves in a coherent way with respect to the dispersion of emissions. 
*[[w:nonpoint source|nonpoint source]] pollutants that enter our water system from runoff that cannot be traced to a single identifiable point or source.  
*A [[w:hybrid vehicle|hybrid vehicle]] is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to move the vehicle.
*A [[w:fuel cell|fuel cell]] is an electrochemical conversion device. It produces electricity from fuel (on the anode side) and an oxidant (on the cathode side), which react in the presence of an electrolyte.

==Requirement 3==
Do ONE activity in EACH of the following categories (using the activities in this {the merit badge} pamphlet as the basis for planning and carrying out your projects): 

A. '''Ecology''' 

# Conduct an experiment to find out how living things respond to changes in their environments. Discuss your observations with your counselor. 
# Conduct an experiment illustrating the greenhouse effect. Keep a journal of your data and observations. Discuss your conclusions with your counselor. 
# Discuss what is an ecosystem. Tell how it is maintained in nature and how it survives.
 

B. '''Air Pollution''' 

# Perform an experiment to test for particulates that contribute to air pollution. Discuss your findings with your counselor. 
# Record the trips taken, mileage, and fuel consumption of a family car for seven days, and calculate how many miles per gallon the car gets. Determine whether any trips could have been combined (&quot;chained&quot;) rather than taken out and back. Using the idea of trip chaining, determine how many miles and gallons of gas could have been saved in those seven days. 
# Explain what is acid rain. In your explanation, tell how it affects plants and the environment and the steps society can take to help reduce its effects. 

C. '''Water Pollution''' 

# Conduct an experiment to show how living things react to thermal pollution. Discuss your observations with your counselor. 
# Conduct an experiment to identify the methods that could be used to mediate (reduce) the effects of an oil spill on waterfowl. Discuss your results with your counselor. 
#Describe the impact of a waterborne pollutant on an aquatic community. Write a 100-word report on how that pollutant affected aquatic fife and what the effect was.

D. '''Land Pollution''' 

# Conduct an experiment to illustrate soil erosion by water. Take photographs or make a drawing of the soil before and after your experiment, and make a poster showing your results. Present your poster to your patrol or troop. 
# Perform an experiment to determine the effect of an oil spill on land. Discuss your conclusions with your counselor. 
# Photograph an area affected by erosion. Share your photographs with your counselor and discuss why the area has eroded and what might be done to help alleviate the erosion. 

E. '''Endangered Species''' 

# Do research on one endangered species found in your state. Find out what its natural habitat is, why it is endangered, what is being done to preserve it, and how many individual organisms are left in the wild. Prepare a 100-word report about the organism, including a drawing. Present your report to your patrol or troop. 
# Do research on one species that was endangered or threatened but which has now recovered. Find out how the organism recovered, and what its new status is. Write a 100-word report on the species and discuss it with your counselor. 
# With your parent's and counselor's approval, work with a natural resource professional to identify two projects that have been approved to improve the habitat for a threatened or endangered species in your area. Visit the site of one of these projects and report on what you saw. 

F. '''Pollution Prevention, Resource Recovery, and Conservation''' 

# Look around your home and determine 10 ways your family can help reduce pollution. Practice at least two of these methods for seven days and discuss with your counselor what you have learned. 
# Determine 10 ways to conserve resources or use resources more efficiently in your home, at school, or at camp. Practice at least two of these methods for seven days and discuss with your counselor what you have learned. 
# Perform an experiment on packaging materials to find out which ones are biodegradable. Discuss your conclusions with your counselor.
# Any of the experiments can be found near the end of the merit badge pamphlet which can be found at your local scout store for $4.49

==Requirement 4==
Choose two outdoor study areas that are very different from one another (e.g., hilltop vs. bottom of a hill; field vs. forest; swamp vs. dry land). For BOTH study areas, do ONE of the following:

A. Mark off a plot of 4 square yards in each study area, and count the number of species found there. Estimate how much space is occupied by each plant species and the type and number of nonplant species you find. Write a report that adequately discusses the biodiversity and population density of these study areas. Discuss your report with your counselor. 

B. Make at least three visits to each of the two study areas (for a total of six visits), staying for at least 20 minutes each time, to observe the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Space each visit far enough apart that there are readily apparent differences in the observations. Keep a journal that includes the differences you observe. Then, write a short report that adequately addresses your observations, including how the differences of the study areas might relate to the differences noted, and discuss this with your counselor.

==Requirement 5==

Using the construction project provided or a plan you create on your own, identify the items that would need to be included in an environmental impact statement for the project planned.

==Requirement 6==

Find out about three career opportunities in environmental science. Pick one and find out the education, training, and experience required for this profession. Discuss this with your counselor, and explain why this profession might interest you.

== Requirement 1 == 
'''&quot;Explain what citizenship in the nation means and what it takes to be a good citizen of this country. Discuss the rights, duties, and obligations of a responsible and active American citizen.&quot;'''

Citizenship by definition is granted by a nation state to a person born in it or given the rights by its government after immigrating there. One can also apply for citizenship by that nations' laws, by legal marriage to one of its citizens or any other combination of requirements of that state, for example after living for sometime there and having a permanent residence. International law and treaties may also apply, for example if one is born while the mother is located within the legal boundaries of a nation it would generally result in the baby having dual nationality/citizenship. 

Being a good citizen should mean being of value and compliant in the eyes of the state. While the notion of citizenship makes only sense in the context of statehood, that is, the legal constructions that are limited by a territory, a nation, the classification of good or bad tends only to relate, in its most basic form, to how a person obeys the laws of the land as set by its government body and enforced by law officials and the courts. Noting that since states tend to lasts longer than its governance, someone that is labeled a bad citizen today may receive accolades for that criticized behavior in future circles of governance, and vice versa.

A good citizen also requires one to be an informed citizen and a participative citizen, by engaging in economic-political-social activities for the betterment of the state. As such knowing the national issues and problems by following news broadcast and press is of extreme importance, but remaining aware that control of the media is the control of the discourse, even your own, so, one should seek as many divergent and independent viewpoints as possible.

According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/citizenship-rights-and-responsibilities Citizenship Rights and Responsibilities]. US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Accessed November 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;, which is currently a program within the US Department of Homeland Security, responsibilities of an active American citizen include:
*Support and defend the Constitution.
*Stay informed of the issues affecting your community.
*Participate in the democratic process.
*Respect and obey federal, state, and local laws.
*Respect the rights, beliefs, and opinions of others.
*Participate in your local community.
*Pay income and other taxes honestly, and on time, to federal, state, and local authorities.
*Serve on a jury when called upon.
*Defend the country if the need should arise.

Citizens' rights include:
*Right to vote
*Right to a fair and speedy trial
*Freedom of religion
*Freedom of speech
*Freedom of the Press
*Freedom of Assembly
*Right to National Security
*Right to Keep and Bear Arms
*Privilege of traveling
*Eligible to work in all areas

==Requirement 2==
'''Do TWO of the following:'''

* ''(a) Visit a place that is listed as a National Historic Landmark or that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Tell your counselor what you learned about the landmark or site and what you found interesting about it.''
* ''(b) Tour your state capitol building or the U.S. Capitol. Tell your counselor what you learned about the capitol, its function, and the history.''
* ''(c) Tour a federal facility. Explain to your counselor what you saw there and what you learned about its function in the local community and how it serves this nation.''
* ''(d) Choose a national monument that interests you. Using books, brochures, the Internet (with your parent's permission), and other resources, find out more about the monument. Tell your counselor what you learned, and explain why the monument is important to this country's citizens.''

==Requirement 3==

Watch the national evening news five days in a row OR read the front page of a major daily newspaper five days in a row.

What world issues did you learn about?

Choose one and explain how it affects you and your family.

==Requirement 4==
'''Discuss each of the following documents with your counselor. Tell your counselor how you feel life in the United States might be different without each one.'''

===(a) Declaration of Independence===

The Declaration of Independence was the US newly established government written document, that asserted US freedom from the rule of English King. Going as far as establishing the right of the people in overthrowing all tyranny and setting rules on how to preserve individual freedoms. The Declaration of Independence, is the document that legally establishes the United States as an independent nation and is at the core of all future legislations, created by the US government.

===(b) Preamble to the Constitution===

The preamble is a table of contents for the constitution. It outlines the most important aspects of the constitution, and explains the reasoning for having a constitution. It is important because it helps people to better understand the constitution and why we have it.

===(c) The Constitution===

The Constitution enshrines the philosophy and reasoning behind the establishment of the U.S. republic, and talks about the different rights and freedoms all citizens must be given and defended. It is essentially an instruction manual. The Constitution is important because it establish the basis of the country's social, legal and political structures.

===(d) Bill of Rights===

The Bill of Rights include the first 10 amendments to the constitution. These are the basic rights of citizens of the United States. Life in the U.S. could be constricted and more federally controlled without one. These basic rights are vital for a truly free country. These rights are often referred to simply by their order in the Bill of Rights, such as &quot;First Amendment rights&quot; or &quot;pleading the Fifth&quot; in legal cases. Most of these amendments help define how criminal courts and investigations are conducted. In brief, these amendments are:
*1. Provides freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly, plus the right to complain to the government.
*2. Guarantees the right to keep and bear firearms and to form a  militia.
*3. Provides freedom from forced housing of soldiers in homes.
*4. Provides freedom from warrant-less search and seizure.
*5. Provides freedom from double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and uncompensated property seizures, and guarantee of a fair trial by jury.
*6. The rights to a lawyer and a speedy trial.
*7. Guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases and prevents courts from overturning a previous jury's findings of fact.
*8. Provides freedom from excessive court bail, fines and &quot;cruel and unusual punishments.&quot;
*9. Provides that other rights may exist in addition to those defined in the Constitution.
*10. Provides that those powers not defined in the Constitution may be defined by the states or the people.

===(e) Amendments to the Constitution===

There are currently a total of 29 amendments to the Constitution, the first 10 being the Bill of Rights. The other amendments are:
*11. Secures the right to sue a state. 
*12. Defines the election of President and Vice President and the fallback system if one should die in office. 
*13. Abolishes slavery. 
*14. Makes any person born within the U.S. an automatic Citizen  
*15. Specifically dictates that all races have full voting rights. 
*16. Allows congress to tax an individual's income. 
*17. Makes Senators an elected position. 
*18. Bans alcohol, beginning the era of Prohibition, beginning in 1919.
*19. Gives women the right to vote, beginning in 1920.
*20. Modifies when terms start/end, sets the presidential line of succession  
*21. Makes the 18th amendment inactive in 1933, thereby un-banning alcohol, and ending Prohibition.
*22. States that no one can be elected President more than 2 terms. 
*23. Gives Washington DC the same number of electoral College votes as any state with the same population

==Requirement 5==
'''List the six functions of government as noted in the preamble to the Constitution. Discuss with your counselor how these functions affect your family and local community.'''

#'''''Form a more perfect Union'''''... States working together
#'''''Establish Justice'''''... Make and enforce laws 
#'''''Ensure Domestic Tranquility'''''... Peace in our country
#'''''Provide for the Common Defense'''''... Keep country safe from an attack
#'''''Promote the General Welfare'''''... Contribute and promote happiness
#'''''Secure the Blessings of Liberty to Ourselves and our Posterity'''''... Make sure we stay free and keep our rights

==Requirement 6==
'''Choose a speech of national historical importance.  Who was the creator?  Tell about the author.  Explain the importance of the speech at the time it was given and how the speech applies to American citizens today.  Quote a sentence and tell why it has meaning to you. Here's an example.'''

'''''Speech:''''' President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address

'''''Author:''''' Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States.  He was also the Commander in Chief of the Union Army during the Civil war.

''“Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we can not dedicate ~ we can not consecrate ~ we can not hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here. 
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot;'' 

'''''Importance of the speech:''''' In 1863, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was the site of one of the bloodiest and most important battles during the Civil War. Over 51,000 causalities had been suffered on both sides. Four months later President Lincoln gave this speech to dedicate a cemetery on this battlefield site. Lincoln reminded everyone what we were fighting for - &quot;one nation under God&quot;.  Not a separated nation.  He also claimed that the nation built by our fore fathers &quot;shall not perish from the earth&quot;. In other words, he would not allow the country to be destroyed.

'''''Tell how it applies to American citizens today.''''' This applies to American citizens today because we must honor those who died fighting for our freedoms and continue the fight to spread freedom throughout the world  

'''''Sentence and what it means:'''''
''&quot;Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot;''

In this sentence Lincoln seems to have been reminding the audience that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; as written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 in the opening of the United States Declaration of Independence that states: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
This concepts have also been extended later, but previous to Lincoln speech, by The United States Bill of Rights (1791) comprising the first 10 constitutional amendments, based on [[w:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789]]. It guaranteed many &quot;natural rights&quot; that were influential in justifying the revolution, and attempted to balance a national government with personal liberties.

==Requirement 7==
'''Name the three branches of our federal government and explain to your counselor their functions. Explain how citizens are involved in each branch. For each branch of government, explain the importance of the system of checks and balances.'''

The three branches are...

#'''''The Executive Branch''''' - applies the '''laws'''
#'''''The Legislative Branch''''' - makes the '''laws'''
#'''''The Judicial Branch''''' - interprets the '''laws'''
Citizens have the right to vote on who takes up office in the legislative branch and though the electoral college the executive branch, however citizens do not elect members of the judicial branch. The Judaical Branch is nominated by the executive and approved by the legislative branch. Citizens also can suggest laws and bills that the legislative branch can vote to put into action as well as petition the government to put a vote to the floor of congress without any members approval. This is how citizens can participate in the government. With checks and balances one branch can check another to keep power balanced. For instance, A president can veto laws that Congress votes for, but if the Congress can get two thirds of the states to vote yes for the bill then that surpasses the veto. Also if the Judicial branch finds a law unconstitutional, then they can make the law null and void.

==Requirement 8==
'''Name your two senators and the member of Congress from your congressional district. Write a letter about a national issue and send it to one of these elected officials, sharing your view with him or her. Show your letter and any response you receive to your counselor.'''

'''To find and contact your two Senators:''' http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

'''To find and contact your Congress person:''' http://www.house.gov/representatives/#state_al

==Requirement 1==
:''Tell what soil is. Tell how it is formed.''
Soil is a combination of rock, sand, clay, minerals, organic material, air, moisture, organisms, crystals, plant roots, decayed leaves &amp; other materials.  As bits of crumbled material &amp; moisture collect on a rock, simple plants begin to grow.  After some time, water, decaying plants, and more minerals collect
:''Describe three kinds of soil. Tell how they are different.''
Sand - Coarse and gritty and you can just barely see individual particles. Silt - Feels smooth like flour. You cannot see the individual particles without using a strong magnifying glass. Clay - Fine granules bond together.
:''Describe the three main plant nutrients in fertile soil. Tell how they can be put back when used up.''
Nitrogen (N)- Main nutrient that contributes to the growth of the above ground plant.  Makes grass greener.  Returned to soil by: Mowing grass &amp; leaving clippings in lawn. Phosphorus (P) - Helps plants germinate.  Also helps plants absorb nutrients to produce more. Provides overall plant health and disease resistance. Returned to soil by: Decomposed plants back into the soil.  Potassium (K): Mainly for strong roots.  Returned to soil by: Decomposed plants back into the soil.

==Requirement 2==
:''Define soil erosion.''
Erosion is the displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock, and other particles) by the agents of wind, water, ice, movement in response to gravity, or living organisms.
:''Tell why it is important. Tell how it affects you.''
It's important because it helps prevent soil from being eroded and becoming chemically altered by overuse.  Soil Conservation helps keep the environment in good working order, which helps provide clean air, food, shelter, clothing and living space which we all need and use.
:''Name three kinds of soil erosion. Describe each.''
Water Erosion: Beating rain &amp; moving water loosen up &amp; carry soil particles, organic material and plant nutrients to a new location. Wind Erosion: A problem in windy areas when the soil is not protected by residue cover.  Geologic:  In dry regions where there is little vegetation and infrequent but intense rains that carves hills and scour valleys.
:''Take pictures or draw two kinds of soil erosion.''

==Requirement 3==
:''Tell what is meant by conservation practices.''
Is any specific action or process to care for natural resources, so they are protected from damage and improved for certain uses.
:''Describe the effect of three kinds of erosion-control practices.''
Terraces:  Are structural practices that can reduce erosion by holding back the water and routing it along a channel at a lower velocity to where it can be safely discharged, usually into a grassed waterway. Cover Crops:  Crops such as rye that grow in late fall and provide soil cover during winter.  By providing a cover to the soil, winter soil erosion from both air and water can be greatly reduced. Strip - Cropping:  Is the practice of planting along the slope instead of up and down slopes, and planting strips of grass between row crops.
:''Take pictures or draw three kinds of erosion-control practices.''

==Requirement 4==
:''Explain what a watershed is.''
It's the area of land that catches rain and snow and drains or seeps into a marsh, stream, river, lake or groundwater.
:''Outline the smallest watershed that you can find on a contour map.''
:''Then outline on your map, as far as possible, the next larger watershed which also has the smallest in it.''
:''Explain what a river basin is. Tell why all people living in it should be concerned about land and water use in it.''
An area of land drained by a river and all its large and small tributaries.  All river basins are large watersheds.  The way that land and water are used and managed affects the quality and quantity of water people in cities downstream will have.

==Requirement 5==
:''Make a drawing to show the water cycle.''
:''Show by demonstration at least two of the following actions of water in relation to soil: percolation, capillary action, precipitation, evaporation, transpiration.''
:''Explain how removal of vegetation will affect the way water runs off a watershed.''
It will make the water run off faster, because nothing is holding it back.
:''Tell how uses of forest, range, and farm land affect usable water supply.
It helps slow down the run-off into the watershed and prevents flooding in other areas.  
:''Explain how industrial use affects water supply.''
It can cause water pollution by dumping chemicals into the rivers and also the ground which gets into our well water.

==Requirement 6==
:''Tell what is meant by water pollution.''
The contamination of water by undesirable foreign matter. It impacts our oceans, our surface water, and our underground water. Pollution comes in many forms--some conventional and others toxic.
:''Describe common sources of water pollution and explain the effects.''
Sources of water pollution are people, factories, septic tanks, road salt, fertilizer. The effects of water pollution are weed Infested lakes, dead fish, sick birds.
:''Tell what is meant by &quot;primary water treatment,&quot; &quot;secondary waste treatment,&quot; and &quot;biochemical oxygen demand.&quot;''
Primary water treatment: Allows the un-dissolved solids in raw sewage to settle out of suspension forming sludge.  This only removes 1/3 of the BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and none of the dissolved minerals. Secondary waste treatment: The effluent from the primary water treatment is brought in contact with oxygen and aerobic microorganisms.  They break down much of the organic matter to harmless substances such as carbon dioxide.  After chlorination to remove its content of bacteria, the effluent from the secondary treatment is returned to the local surface water. Biochemical oxygen demand: The BOD is a measure of the amount of oxygen needed (in milligrams per liter or parts per million) by bacteria and other microorganisms to oxidize the organic matter present in a water sample over a period of 5 days.
:''Make a drawing showing the principles of complete waste treatment.''

==Requirement 7==
:''Take a trip to two of the following places. Write a report of more than 500 words about the soil and water and energy conservation practices you saw.''
::''An agricultural experiment.''
::''A managed forest or woodlot, range, or pasture.''
::''A wildlife refuge or a fish or game management area.''
::''A conservation-managed farm or ranch.''
::''A managed watershed.''
::''A waste-treatment plant.''
::''A public drinking water treatment plant.''
::''Industry water use installation.''
::''Desalinization plant.''
:''Plant 100 trees, bushes and/or vines for a good purpose.''
:''Seed an area of at least 1/5 acre for some worthwhile conservation purpose, using suitable grasses or legumes alone or in a mixture.''
:''Study a soil survey report. Describe the thing in it. On tracing paper over any of the soil maps, outline an area with three or more different kinds of soil. List each kind of soil by full name and map symbol.''
:''Make a list of places in your neighborhood, camps, school ground, or park having erosion, sedimentation, or pollution problems. Describe how these could be corrected through individual or group action.''
:''Carry out any other soil and water conservation project approved in advance.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">['''This page is of historical use only now, as the GCSE Science has changed - it no longer uses the POAE criteria'''.]

Each piece of coursework is split into four strands, of which three (Planning, Obtaining and Analysing) are worth 8 marks, and one (Evaluation) is worth 6 marks. In the event of a school prescribing more than one piece of coursework for a subject, the overall coursework mark will the be the sum of the highest marks in each strand. For example, if one obtained the marks '''8 7 6 5''' and '''7 4 7 3''', the overall mark would be '''8 7 7 5''', giving a total of 27 marks.

The coursework marking is the same for all the subjects &amp;ndash; even if you are doing Dual Award science, you will still have to do at least three pieces of coursework.

As with all coursework, you will be required to fill in a sheet stating what help you received. The information in this section is merely a description of the marking scheme, and as such does not need to be included. However, if you use any of the rest of this book, you will need to acknowledge it as you would do with other textbook (see [[Help:FAQ/Readers#How_do_I_cite_a_Wikibooks_module_in_a_paper.3F|How do I cite a Wikibooks module in a paper]]).

N.B. The information describes the AQA coursework system. Although it is likely to be the same for other exam boards, check if you will be taking an exam from another exam board. Specifically, AQA's marking scheme is hierarchical &amp;ndash; the lower marks need to be obtained before the higher ones are. This may not apply to other boards. The mark descriptions are taken verbatim from the AQA documents, and their use is contended to be fair use.

==Planning (P)==

You will have to perform a preliminary and produce a plan before you carry out the actual investigation. The plan is expected to use the results of the preliminary to suggest a possible experiment that can be carried out. This will typically involve a recommendation of which factor should be altered, what should be measured, and what range of results should be taken. It is important to make a prediction here, as it is needed for marks in the Analysis.

You should also make reference to safety and how your experiment will be fair, talk about the variables involved, your independent variable (the one you have chosen to investigate) and dependent variable (the factor you will be recording). These come in very helpful and pick up a few more marks.

==Obtaining Evidence (O)==

This strand is marked on how you perform while performing the experiment itself. You will be marked on both how you perform during the experiment and your results table, which must be handed in.

In the unlikely event of no results being obtained from the Obtaining, your teacher will issue you with a set of results to use for the Analysis and Evaluation. You will, however, receive no or few marks on this section if you do not take your own results.

====Mark Descriptions====

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;2 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''O.2a''' collect some evidence using a simple and safe procedure&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;4 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''O.4a''' collect appropriate evidence which is adequate for the activity&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''O.4b''' record the evidence&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;6 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''O.6a''' collect sufficient systematic and accurate evidence and repeat or check where appropriate&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''O.6b''' record clearly and accurately the evidence collected &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;8 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''O.8a''' use a procedure with precision and skill to obtain and record an appropriate range of reliable evidence&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

==Analysing and considering evidence (A)==

The analysis is intended as the longest section of the coursework, because it involves processing the data collected from the Obtaining Evidence section of the mark scheme. Graphs are notablly important here, as is a conclusion, which is required to sum up the data which has been processed.


Mark Descriptions

'''2 marks'''
 
'''A.2a''' state simply what is shown by the evidence 

'''4 marks''' 

'''A.4a''' use simple diagrams, charts or graphs as a basis for explaining the evidence 

'''A.4b''' identify trends and patterns in the evidence 

'''6 marks''' 

'''A.6a''' construct and use suitable diagrams, charts, graphs (with lines of best fit, where appropriate), or use numerical methods, to process evidence for a conclusion 


'''A.6b''' draw a conclusion consistent with the evidence and explain it using scientific knowledge and understanding 


'''9-16 marks'' mention a naseebo lal song and analyse it refering to its social historical and vulgar context'' 

'''finally for 17-20 marks mention the laws of naseebo mujra'''

'''A.8a''' use detailed scientific knowledge and understanding to explain a valid conclusion drawn from processed evidence 

'''A.8b''' explain the extent to which the conclusion supports the prediction, if one has been made

==Evaluating (E)==

The Evaluation consists of identifying any anomalous data, and suggesting possible improvements to the experiment.

===Mark Descriptions===

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;2 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''E.2a''' make a relevant comment about the procedure used or the evidence obtained&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;4 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''E.4a''' comment on the quality of the evidence, identifying any anomalies&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''E.4b''' comment on the suitability of the procedure and, where appropriate, suggest changes to improve it&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;6 marks&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''E.6a''' consider critically the reliability of the evidence and whether it is sufficient to support the conclusion, accounting for any anomalies&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;'''E.6b''' describe, in detail, further work to provide additional relevant evidence&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]]

A '''dosa''' is a thin, spicy, crispy crêpe-like food made from fermented rice, very popular in restaurants in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. It may be served plain with [[Cookbook:Sambar|sambar]] and chutneys such as  [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|coconut chutney]] (as pictured), or other curry or gravy. When served with [[Cookbook:potato|potato]] folded inside, it is known as '''masala dosa'''. To make omelette dosa, simply pour beaten egg on the dosa before it is turned over.

The procedure for making dosa starts out almost identical to that for making [[Cookbook:Idli|idli]]. The idli recipe in this cookbook has some very good [[Cookbook:Idli#Notes, tips, and variations|tips and variations]] that apply equally to dosai.

== First Variation ==
===Ingredients=== 
* 3 cups white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dal]] (black gram)
* handful of cooked rice (if required)
* pinch of [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (if desired)
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===Procedure===
====Batter====
# Put the rice and dal in a large pot and wash twice.
# Fill with water until submerged by 2 inches.
# Soak for 6 hours.
# [[Cookbook:Purée|Grind]] in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], water and all, for 30 minutes. If the weather is cold, grind in a handful of cooked rice and a pinch of sugar to help in fermentation.
# Let ferment overnight in a warm place. Make sure the pot is twice as large as the amount of batter, as it will rise a great deal.
# Add salt; at this point the batter can be kept in the refrigerator for more than a week until you wish to fry the dosas.

====Dosas====
# Heat a [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]] (large flat pan) or [[cookbook:griddle|griddle]] over a high flame.
# Sprinkle water on the pan to cool it a little.
# Pour ½&amp;ndash;¾ cup batter in the middle of the pan, depending on preferred thickness and crispiness.
# Spread the batter with the back of a spoon, starting from the centre and spiralling outwards until the dosa is about 10 inches across and very thin.
# Sprinkle a little [[cookbook:oil|oil]] around the edges of the dosa.
# Cover until the dosa shows brown through the thinnest parts.
# Turn the dosa around on its back and allow it to cook for a few seconds.
# Fold in half and remove with a metal spatula.

Makes 10&amp;ndash;15.

== Second Variation ==

=== Preparation ===
Makes about 20
*2 cups (360 g) rice, preferably parboiled
*1/2 cup (90 g) split and husked [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dal]] ('dhuli urad')
*1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek seeds]] (methi dana)
*2 tsp salt
*Oil for cooking doshas

'''Method '''

# Soak rice, dal, and fenugreek seeds together overnight.
# Grind these ingredients together to a very smooth consistency. 
# Add the salt and enough water to make into a dropping consistency, and leave to rise for 5-6 hours, or overnight. 
# Check consistency of the batter, and if needed, add enough water to make into a smooth pouring consistency.
# Heat [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]] (dosa pan) very hot, splash a little water over it, and with a ladle, immediately pour some batter onto it, spreading it thin, with a circular motion, without pressing too hard. (You will need some practice to get it right).
# Lower the heat and dribble a little oil around the edges. When edges start browning a bit, it is  almost done.
# Turn the dosa around on its back and allow it to cook for a few seconds.
# Add desired filling and fold over.

== Masala Dosa (Mysore style) ==

=== Ingredients for preparation ===
====Batter====
*Ponni or Sona Masuri [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]: 1 Cup
*Boiled Rice: 1 Cup
*[[Cookbook:Urad Dal|Urad dal]] (whole skinless black gram): ¾ Cup
*Non iodized [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]: To Taste

====Filling====
*[[Cookbook:Potato|Potatoes]]: 6 Medium Sized, [[Cookbook:Boil|Boiled]] and coarsely mashed
*[[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]: 2 Medium Sized, Finely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Green Chili Pepper]]: 3 to 6, Finely Chopped
*[[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]]: 1 Tsp, finely grated
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]: 1 Tsp, finely grated
*[[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]]: 2 Tbsp
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard Seeds]]: ½ Tsp
*[[Cookbook:Cilantro|Cilantro]]: 1 TBS, finely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Channa dhal|Chana Dal]]: 1 Tsp
*[[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]]: 1 Tsp
*[[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry Leaves]]: 1 Tsp, coarsely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Onion Chutney|Onion Chutney]]
*[[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|Coconut Chutney]]

====For Assembly====
*Mixture of [[Cookbook:Ghee|Ghee]] and vegetable shortening: ½ cup

=== Preparation Method ===
====Batter====
On the day before, grind all the ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or specialized dosa grinder with water. The final consistency of the batter must be similar to [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] batter. Leave it overnight in a warm spot and allow it to [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]]. This is a very important process and must not be skipped. During fermentation the batter may rise to almost twice its volume and therefore the container for the batter must allow for this.

====Chutneys====
Prepare the two chutneys as described in [[Cookbook:Onion Chutney|Onion Chutney]] and [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|Coconut Chutney]]

====Filling====
In a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] or other deep vessel heat the oil. When the oil is hot add the mustard seeds and allow it to splutter. When spluttering starts to recede add the chopped green chilies, curry leaves and the channa dal. Stir until the channa dal turns brown. (Be careful as channa dal can go from browned to burnt within seconds). Add the onions and fry until browned and add turmeric and stir for 2 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and stir it in for a few seconds. Add the boiled and coarsely mashed potatoes into the mix and fold well. Turn off the heat and add lemon juice and the coriander leaves. Fold well.

=== Making a Dosa ===
Dosai can easily be made on a [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]], iron [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] or non-stick pan. Heat the pan on a medium heat until a drop of water evaporates on contact.
Spread about 1/2 cup of batter on the pan (like pancakes) slowing spreading it outwards forming a thin, flat circular dosa. Allow it cook for a minute and using a flat, sharp [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] flip it over. As the other side cooks spread a layer of ghee-shortening mixture on the topside. Flip it over again. As the bottom crisps add a Tsp of the onion chutney on the top and spread it evenly. Add some of the filling onto one half of the dosa and fold the other side over. Serve with coconut chutney.

:''Prepare an exhibit or a scrapbook illustrating three major achievements of the American labor movement.

:''In 500 words or more, write about one of the founders of organized labor in the United States. 

John L. Lewis was president of the UMWA from 1920-1960. He was a giant among American leaders in the first half of the twentieth century, regularly advising presidents and challenging America's corporate leaders. His work to organize the country's industrial workers through the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the 1930s helped raise living standards for millions of American families. In the first year of the CIO, nearly four million workers joined labor organizations and wages were raised by over a billion dollars. Lewis sent hundreds of UMWA organizers to help create some of the nation's leading labor unions, including the United Steelworkers of America (USWA), the United Auto Workers (UAW), the Communication Workers of America (CWA) and many other important labor organizations that continue to speak in behalf of America's workers. 

Perhaps Lewis' greatest legacy was the creation of the UMWA Welfare and Retirement Fund in a contract with the federal government, signed in the White House with President Truman in attendance. The UMWA Fund would change permanently health care delivery in the coal fields of the nation. The UMWA Fund built eight hospitals in Appalachia and established numerous clinics. In 1964, Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian decoration, by President Lyndon Johnson. He remained Chairman of the UMWA Fund until his death in 1969.

==Requirement 2==
a. ''Name the five general groups of musical instruments. b. Create an illustration that shows how tones are generated and how instruments produce sound.''


a. The the science of musical instruments is called ''organology''. It embraces the study of instruments' history, instruments used in different cultures, technical aspects of how instruments produce sound, and musical instrument classification.


Musical instruments are frequently classified by the way they generate sound:


*'''Woodwind instruments''' generate a sound when a column of air is made to vibrate inside them. The frequency of the wave generated is related to the length of the column of air and the shape of the instrument, while the tone quality of the sound generated is affected by the construction of the instrument and method of tone production. Vibrations are created by blowing air across a single reed, double reed or across a sharp-edged hole opening at or near the end of the instrument. The clarinet and saxophone families are examples of single reed woodwinds. The oboe and bassoon are examples of double reed woodwinds. Flutes produce sound when air is blown across the embouchure hole.


*'''Brasswind instruments''' generate sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips which are “buzzed” in the instrument’s mouthpiece. There are several factors involved in producing different pitches on a brass instrument. One is alteration of the player's lip tension (or embouchure), and another is air flow. Also, slides or valves are used to change the length of the tubing, thus changing the harmonic series presented by the instrument to the player. There are two different kinds of brass: low and high. The tuba, baritone and trombone are examples of low brass. The trumpet and French horn are examples of high brass.


*'''Percussion instruments''' generate sound, with or without a definite pitch, when hit with an implement, shaken, rubbed, scraped, or by any other action which sets the object into vibration. The shape and material of the part of the instrument to be struck and the shape of the resonating cavity, if any, determine the sound of the instrument. The term usually applies to an object used in a rhythmic context or with musical intent. Examples of definite pitch percussion are chimes, glockenspiel, handbells, marimba, steelpan, gong, timpani and xylophone. Examples of indefinite pitch percussion are bass drum, castanet, cymbal, slapstick, snare drum, tom-tom drum and tam-tam.


*'''String instruments''' generate a sound when a string is plucked, strummed, slapped, etc.  The frequency of the wave generated (and therefore the note produced) usually depends on the length of the vibrating portion of the string, the diameter of the string, the tension of the string,  and the point at which the string is excited. The tone quality varies according to the construction of the resonating cavity (size, shape and wood used), the material the string is made of, how the string is excited into motion, and the expertise of the musician. The guitar, violin, mandolin, ukulele, harp, autoharp, harpsichord and piano are examples of string instruments.


*'''Electronic instruments''' generate sound through electronic means. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical audio signal that ultimately drives a loudspeaker. They can mimic all of the other instruments or create very unique sounds. The digital piano, electronic keyboard, organ, analog synthesizer, digital synthesizer, MIDI instruments (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), wind synthesizer, digital drums and virtual musical instruments are examples of electronic instruments.



Many [[w:en:musical instrument classification|alternate divisions and further subdivisions of instruments]] exist. See also [http://cnx.org/content/m11896/latest/ Classifying Musical Instruments].
To learn about a specific instrument, consult the [[w:en:list of musical instruments|list of musical instruments]] or [[w:en:List of archaic musical instruments|List of archaic musical instruments]]. 


The human body, generating both vocal and percussive sounds, was the first human musical instrument. Most likely the first prehistoric rhythm instruments or percussion instruments involved the clapping of hands, hitting stones together, or other materials that are useful to create rhythm. The oldest flutes discovered thus far were in the Hohle Fels Cave in Germany and were dated at about 35,000 years old. All classes of instruments, other than electronic, are mentioned in ancient historic sources, such as Egyptian, Chinese, East Indian, Greek and Roman inscriptions and the Bible and have actually been recovered from historical archaeological sites from around the world.

==Requirement 3==
Do TWO of the following:

a. ''Attend a live performance, or listen to three hours of recordings from any two of the following musical styles: blues, jazz, classical, country, bluegrass, ethnic, gospel, musical theater, opera. Describe the sound of the music and the instruments used. Identify the composers or songwriters, the performers, and the titles of the pieces you heard. If it was a live performance, describe the setting and the reaction of the audience. Discuss your thoughts about the music.''

If there is a program, make good use of the notes.


b. ''Interview your parents and grandparents about music. Find out what the most popular music was when they were your age. Find out what their favorite music is now, and listen to three of their favorite tunes with them. How do their favorites sound to you? Had you ever heard any of them? Play three of your favorite songs for them, and explain to them why you like these songs. Ask them what they think of your favorite music.''


c. ''Serve for six months as a member of a school, church, Scout unit, or other local musical organization, or perform as a soloist in public six times.''


d. ''List five people who are important in the history of American music and explain to your counselor why they continue to be influential. Include at least one composer, one performer, one innovator, and one person born more than 100 years ago.''

==Requirement 4==
Do ONE of the following:

a. ''Teach three songs to a group of people. Lead them in singing the songs, using proper hand motions.''

*'''Teaching a Song.''' These tips will get you started and help you relax and have some fun, too.
	1. Practice the words and the melody of the song you will teach until you know the song by heart.
	2. Smile at the group. Be enthusiastic and act confident, even if this is your first time teaching a song.
	3. Start with a lively, well-known warm-up number, so everyone (including you) can sing with confidence.
	4. Tell the group the name of the song, and provide copies of the lyrics. Use songbooks or song sheets, or write the lyrics on a blackboard or large sheet of paper.
	5. Sing the song through alone or with a small group that already knows it.
	6. Then sing phrase by phrase and have the group repeat after you. If the song has several verses, teach one verse at a time.
	7 When the group has learned the phrases or verses, sing the song all together. If the song is fast or difficult, sing it slowly at first, then pick up speed as the singers master it.
	8. Musical accompaniment helps. Piano, accordion, guitar and harmonica are good accompaniments because they can play harmony, not just the melody.
	9. When the group has sung the song a time or two, stop. Do not work so hard that it is no longer fun. Go all at once to a familiar song.

Boy Scouts of America Merit Badge Series, Music, #35921, page 49, 2010.


*'''Leading a Song.''' Because teaching is a part of song leading, many of the previous tips apply to both. Here are a few more hints to help you lead songs successfully.
	1. Give the starting note. Sing or hum a few bars of the song. Or, have a few bars played, if an instrument is available. Be careful not to pitch the song too high or low. If you start the group on the wrong note, stop and start over.
	2. Start with a slight upward arm motion followed by a decisive downward motion (a downbeat), and begin singing. Do not worry if some don’t start with the first note. They will join quickly.
	3. Beat time with a simple down-and-up motion of the arm. Hold your arm high enough for everyone to see, and make your gestures definite and brisk. You are in command.
	4. Control volume by raising your free hand for loudness and lowering it for softness.
	5. Move around a little, put some energy into it, and smile.
	6. Stop while everyone is still having fun. Leave the group wanting more.

b. ''Compose and write the score for a piece of music twelve measures or more.''

See [http://www.musictheory.net/ MusicTheory.net] [http://method-behind-the-music.com/theory/ Music Theory] [http://www.people.vcu.edu/~bhammel/theory/resources/flash/interactive_chord_chart.swf Chord Chart ''In Sequence''] [http://www.looknohands.com/chordhouse/piano/ Chord House] [http://www.angelfire.com/fl4/moneychords/lesson.html Money Chords] [http://www.blanksheetmusic.net/ Free Printable Staff Paper] [http://www.free-blank-sheet-music.com/ More Free Printable Staff Paper]



c. ''Make a traditional instrument and learn to play it.''

See [http://www.kinderart.com/teachers/9instruments.shtml Kinder Art] [http://www.wannalearn.com/Crafts_and_Hobbies/Woodworking/Building_Musical_Instruments/ Wanna Learn Building Musical Instruments]



d. ''Catalog your own or your family's collection of 12 or more compact discs, tapes or records. Show how to handle and store them.''

*'''Classifying Your Collection.''' Classify (organize) your recordings in a way that suits you, but keep your system simple and flexible. You can classify recordings in several ways:
•	In chronological order of the periods during which the music was written.
•	In alphabetical order, by names of performers, composers or titles.
•	By category—classical, folk, jazz, country, rock, etc.
•	In numerical order, by catalog numbers.
•	In combinations of these or according to your own numbering system.

Boy Scouts of America Merit Badge Series, Music, #35921, page 62, 2010.


*'''Caring for Compact Discs (CD) and Players.'''
	1. Handle CDs carefully by the edges.
	2. After playing, store each CD in its protective plastic case. CDs can be stored horizontally or vertically in storage units.
	3. A carrying case is good for organizing CDs as well as for transporting them.
	4. Wipe carefully handled CDs with a soft cloth, stroking from the center to the rim. If a CD has been soiled, you can clean it gently with soap and water.
	5. Place a CD on a level surface, away from dampness, high humidity, and extreme heat. Protect it from strong vibrations or jolting.
	6. CD players ordinarily need no maintenance. If the player malfunctions, consult your dealer or a repair shop. Repair requires a trained technician and specialized tools.

*'''Handling Records.'''
	1. Handle records by the edges. Avoid touching the grooved surfaces. Use a soft brush or cloth to keep them free of dust, making strokes in a circular direction along the grooves.
	2. When you play the records manually, lower the tone arm onto the record gently. A bumpy landing can scratch and injure the record and damage the needle.
	3. Be sure the needle (stylus) is in good condition at all times. A worn needle can ruin your records. Replace diamond needles after every 1,000 hours of play.
	4. Discard records that are cracked or full of nicks. They can damage the needle.

*'''Caring for Tapes and Tape Players.'''
	1. Clean and demagnetize the tape heads after at least every 20 hours of use to remove tiny particles that tapes leave behind. Do this especially before you plan to record an important program or play a valuable tape. Use cotton swabs soaked with denatured, &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. You can buy denatured alcohol or a special cleaning solution from an electronics or music store. Allow the heads to dry for 30 minutes before inserting a tape.
	2. After you have cleaned the heads, use the swabs to clean the metal guides along the tape path.
	3. To avoid erasing a cassette tape by accident, remove the small plastic tabs on the back of the cassette. Use a small screwdriver to pry out the tabs. Commercially recorded tapes already have he tabs removed.

*'''Storage.'''
Store record albums in an upright position and fit snugly against each other. Flat or slanted storage will cause the records to warp. Store tapes and CDs in a cabinet or case that protects them from dust and allows you to keep them organized and safe.

e. ''Give a brief history of the bugle, and explain how the bugle is related to other brass wind instruments. Demonstrate how the bugle makes sound, then explain how to care for, clean, and maintain a bugle.''

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugle Bugle] [http://tapsbugler.com/an-introductory-history-of-the-bugle/ History of the Bugle] [http://www.middlehornleader.com/Evolution%20of%20the%20Bugle.htm Evolution of the Bugle] [http://www.ehow.com/how_5089142_play-bugle.html How to Play a Bugle] [http://www.ehow.com/how_2157485_blow-bugle.html How to Blow a Bugle] [http://www.ehow.com/how_7344376_tune-bugle.html How to Tune a Bugle] [http://www.ehow.com/videos-on_2635_play-trumpet.html How to Play a Trumpet] [http://www.ehow.com/how_7694772_care-bugle.html How to Take Care of a Bugle] [http://www.ehow.com/videos-on_2727_clean-brass-instruments.html How to Clean Brass Instruments]



f. ''Compose a bugle call for your troop or patrol to signal a common group activity, such as assembling for mealtime or striking a campsite. Play the call that you have composed before your unit or patrol.''



g. ''Sound the following bugle calls: “First Call,” “Reveille,” “Assembly,” “Mess,” “To the Colors,” and “Taps.” Then explain when each of these calls is used.''

“First Call” is generally used to just get everyone’s attention that something will be happening soon (like assembly) and is sometimes used at race tracks as the “call to the post” (horses get in line to start the race).
“Reveille” is used to awaken people and lets them know it is time to get up and about.
“Assembly” is used to call everyone together, for everyone to “fall in”, often at a designated place.
“Mess” signals that it is time to eat. It is also used at times at athletic events to stir up the crowd.
“To The Colors” is a bugle call to render honors to the nation. The most common use is when the national flag is being lowered at the end of the day (where everyone may be assembled as well). It commands the same courtesies as the National Anthem.
“Taps” signifies “lights out” at the end of the evening. Lyrics can be sung to it called “Day is Done”. It may also be played during flag ceremonies and at funerals, particularly for veterans.

B) The concepts of return on investment and risk.&lt;br /&gt;
C) The concepts of simple interest and compound interest and how these affected the results of your investment exercise

Explain the differences between saving and investing, including reasons for using one over the other: 

Savings has a guaranteed low return with loss of money possible if you go over the insurance amount of $250,000 per account named depositor, per insured bank.(as of 6/7/09) Investing has a risk of losing you money but chance of a higher return.

Explain the concepts of return on investment and risk: 

Risk - Possibility of your investment losing the money you put in.&lt;br /&gt;
ROI = (gain from investment – cost of investment)/cost of investment

Explain the concepts of simple interest and compound interest and how these affected the results of your investment exercise: 

Simple interest is calculated on principal only, Compound interest is calculated on total of principal plus the interest earned.

==Requirement 5==  

Select five publicly traded stocks from the business section of the newspaper. Explain to your merit badge counselor the
importance of the following information for each stock:

A) Current price.

B) How much the price changed from the previous day.

E) A savings account or U.S. savings bond.

==Requirement 7==

Explain to your merit badge counselor the following:

A) What a loan is, what interest is, and how the annual percentage rate (APR) measures the true cost of a loan.

a. What a loan is, 
A loan is a financial transaction in which one party (the lender) agrees to give another party (the borrower) a certain amount of money with the expectation of total repayment. The specific terms of a loan are often spelled out in the form of a promissory note or other contract. The lender can ask for interest payments in addition to the original amount of the loan (principal). The borrower must agree to the repayment terms, including the amount owed, interest rate and due dates. Some lenders can also assign financial penalties for missed or late payments.

what interest is, 
An interest rate is the price a borrower pays for the use of money they do not own, for instance a small company might borrow from a bank to kick start their business, and the return a lender receives for deferring the use of funds, by lending it to the borrower. Interest rates are normally expressed as a percentage rate over the period of one year.

and how the annual percentage rate (APR) measures the true cost of a loan.
You can think about the interest rate as a percentage of the money borrowed to be paid. The best way to compare mortgage loans is by comparing the Annual Percentage Rate, or APR on each prospective loan offer.
By law, every mortgage loan offer, usually in the form of a disclosure called a Good Faith Estimate, must disclose APR associated with the loan. When we talk about real estate loans, interest rates are also sometimes referred to as mortgage rates.


B) The different ways to borrow money.

C) The differences between a charge card, debit card, and credit card. What are the costs and pitfalls of using these financial tools? Explain why it is unwise to make only the minimum payment on your credit card.

D) Credit reports and how personal responsibility can affect your credit report.

E) Ways to reduce or eliminate debt.

==Requirement 8==
8) Demonstrate to your merit badge counselor your understanding of time management by doing the following:
 A) Write a “to do” list of tasks or activities, such as homework assignments, chores, and personal projects, that must be done
 in the coming week. List these in order of importance to you.
 B) Make a seven-day calendar or schedule. Put in your set activities, such as school classes, sports practices or games, jobs
 or chores, and/or Scout or church or club meetings, then plan when you will do all the tasks from your “to do” list between
 your set activities.
 C) Follow the one-week schedule you planned. Keep a daily diary or journal during each of the seven days of this week’s
 activities, writing down when you completed each of the tasks on your “to do” list compared to when you scheduled them.
 D) Review your “to do” list, one-week schedule, and diary/journal to understand when your schedule worked and when it did
 not work. With your merit badge counselor, discuss and understand what you learned from this requirement and what you
 might do differently the next time.

==Requirement 9==
9) Prepare a written project plan demonstrating the steps below, including the desired outcome. This is a project on paper,    not a reallife project. Examples could include planning a camping trip, developing a community service project or a school or religious event,or creating an annual patrol plan with additional activities not already included in the troop annual plan. Discuss your completed project plan with your merit badge counselor.
  A) Define the project. What is your goal?
  B) Develop a timeline for your project that shows the steps you must take from beginning to completion.
  C) Describe your project.
  D) Develop a list of resources. Identify how these resources will help you achieve your goal.
  E) If necessary, develop a budget for your project.

==Requirement 10==
10) Do the following:
  A) Choose a career you might want to enter after high school or college graduation.
  B) Research the limitation of your anticipated career and discuss with your merit badge counselor what you have learned
  about qualifications such as education, skills, and experience.

[[Image:Sennis VonBraun.gif|right|thumb|Werner Von Braun (rightmost)]]
'''Werner Von Braun'''

German scientist and creator of the German V-2 rocket which devastated London during WWII. He would prove instrumental in the design and creation of technology for the space program.

'''Yuri Gagarin'''

Russian cosmonaut; first man in space.

'''Vladimir Komarov'''

Russian Cosmonaut; First man to die in space. After a short period in space upon re-entry the parachutes on his spacecraft failed to open to slow the vehicle descent. Russian spacecraft of the era landed on earth rather than in the ocean as did the United States' spacecraft 'splashdown'. The parachutes of Cosmonaut Komarov's craft were burnt off during re-entry and this was noticed by observers in the upper part of the atmosphere. Communication with the spacecraft was established soon after re-entry and Cosomonaut Komarov was informed of the development and appraised that nothing could be done. There was time to inform his wife and have her present in the control room for the final moments. This man has been called a hero.

'''Alan Shepard'''

American astronaut; first American in space. Would later walk on the moon on Apollo 14 after battling an inner ear disease.

'''Neil Armstrong'''

American astronaut; first man to walk on the moon.

'''Jim Lovell'''

American astronaut; commander of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission.

== The Machines ==
== Mercury ==

[[/Mercury Missions/]]

== Gemini ==

A two man space craft that was instrumental in developing docking and EVA techniques. Gemini hardware was used to perform the first manned-unmanned docking in space.

[[/Gemini Missions/]]

== Apollo ==

A three man space craft consisting of a service module, which contained the engines and most of the flight hardware, and the command module, which was the portion of the spacecraft that would return to Earth.

Apollo 11 carried the Lunar Module to the Sea of Tranquility region of the moon, where it touched down for the first manned lunar landing. Apollo would serve as the primary NASA spacecraft until it was replaced by the Space Shuttle Transportion System (STS).

[[/Apollo Missions/]]

== Lunar Module ==

A spider-like spacecraft composed of a descent stage, which carried the descent and ascent stages to the surface of the moon, and an ascent stage, which used the descent stage as a launchpad to return to the Apollo command module in lunar orbit.

The lunar module was stored in the uppermost stage of the Saturn V rocket, until it was retrieved by the Apollo spacecraft through a docking maneuver.

==not exactly==
In response to the reply below- it's a vietnamese sub and quite a different experience from subway or a meatball grinder.  I would not put sauerkraut or some other incompatible ingredient in it- then it would be fusion cuisine sub and quite odd i might add.  I was trying to outline the ingredients and preparation methods that I have observed from several bahn mi places.  But thanks for the feedback!

I will investigate how to peel this off and integrate it into both vietnamese cuisine as well as sub sandwiches.

--mchrisneglia

==American cucumbers==
It is possible to use the American-variety cucumber in ''bánh mì'' &amp;ndash; perhaps not the best way, but a decent alternative when you're in a pickle &amp;ndash; no pun intended! &amp;ndash; [[User:Mxn|Minh Nguyễn]] 03:15, 23 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Huh?==
This is a sub, right? A submarine sandwich? In other words, rename it to Cookbook:Sub.

I'll grant that some of the fillings are a bit unusual, but sliced turkey and bacon
wouldn't be out of place in that list. The same goes for saurkraut and pastrami,
teriyaki, BLT, or even ham and cheese.

:There's no reason why another recipe can't be written at [[Cookbook:Submarine Sandwich]]. You also might want to read [[Cookbook:Po' Boy]], and [[Cookbook:French Dip Sandwiches]].  There is more than enough room for different recipes for similar items in this cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 04:27, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Sure, but this appears to be an exact match. The one possible distinction involves warming the bread. If I were making a sub though, I'd warm the bread if I wasn't feeling lazy or if the bread was a bit old. So... this ''is'' a sub. It's not just ''similar'' to a sub; it ''is'' one.

:Having eaten a Banh Mi, I can say that the cilantro in the recipe makes this sandwich a unique eating experience, very different than a sub.  Also, there is less meat used than would be typical in a sub, resulting in a lighter sandwich. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:22, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Do you mean that cilantro is always used? All the &quot;Standard&quot; ingredients are always used? If so, that sure wasn't clear. The way I read things, you could just use the meatballs. It's kind of like saying that mayonaise, American cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce are standard sub ingredients -- but a sub with just tofu and hot sauce is still a sub. So do you think a &quot;Bánh Mì&quot; with just the smoked salmon and sprout mix wouldn't count?


==RE: Huh?==
No, if anything it should be added to a Vietnamese cuisine cookbook.  It is a sub, but if you call it a 'vietnamese sub', then people who know what 'bahn mi' is will get confused and won't find it.

== bahn mi in Atlanta ==

There is a Bahn Mi restaurant on Buford Highway in the 'Ranch99' shopping center.  Parking / navigation in the 
center is tough, but it's worth it.  Can't remember the name (maybe it's 'bahn mi'?) but it's on the left side of the shopping center when oriented facing the ranch99 supermarket, about halfway to the last shop closest to Buford highway.  Bahn Mi is only available
for lunch, but their dinners and appetizers are great too.  kind of a dive, but arguably the best bahn mi in 
town.  very inexpensive as i remember too, like 2 bucks for a sandwich or something crazy like that.

-mchrisneglia

== The name ==

This is probably splitting hairs, but being Vietnamese myself, I couldn't help but notice&amp;ndash;Bánh is just the Vietnamese word for &quot;bread&quot;. Just &quot;bread&quot;, not the sandwich itself. For this reason, I propose renaming it to Bánh Mì Ba Leo, the actual name for this sandwich. [[User:70.187.228.170|70.187.228.170]] 18:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== RE: the name ==

If you want to make the page better, than write in the article that 'bahn mi ba leo' is the actual name of the sandwich.  If you were a vietnamese person, or should you frequent vietnamese restaurants, you would notice very quickly that they always list the sandwich as 'bahn mi'.  So, in essence, I believe you are incorrect by trying to name something opposite of convention.  This is an article in English, for english-speakers.  If you want them to be able to understand what they are reading and help them search to find the article, you would be wise to stay user-oriented and go with convention.  If you want to wax academic then go ahead and add that as a pointer to the original article and improve the article instead of talking about it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In detailing the history of the Apollo missions, the most compelling question as a historian is, &quot;where to stop?&quot; As mankind's perhaps most significant achievement, the wealth of information regarding the Apollo missions is overwhelming. Below is a brief overview of the purpose, achievements, and some other critical data regarding each mission.

&lt;p /&gt;
During a 'plugs-out' (disconnected from any earthbound umbilicals) test, faulty wiring under one of the astronauts seats combined with the cabin atmosphere which was 16 Pounds per square inch (PSI) pure oxygen caused a fire in the cabin, killing all three crew members in less than a minute: Virgil I. (&quot;Gus&quot;) Grissom, Edward H. White II, and Roger B. Chaffee. Later missions would use a less combustible mixture of nitrogen and oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Requirements==
'''Requirement 1a''':''Explain to your counselor the hazards you are most likely to encounter while participating in wilderness survival activities, and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, or lessen these hazards.'' 

COMMENT:
While risk reduction is an important concept and while this requirement opens the way to learning about the previously-omitted hazards that cause 75% of wilderness fatalities,  this new requirement overlaps requirements 1b, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

'''Requirement 1b''':''Show that you know first aid for and how to prevent injuries or illnesses likely to occur in backcountry settings, including hypothermia, heat reactions, frostbite, dehydration, blisters, insect stings, tick bites, and snakebites.''[emphasis added]

COMMENT:
A great improvement over prior language that required knowledge of first aid for all possible illness or injuries.  However, still omits listing first aid for heart attack and drowning, which cause about half of all wilderness fatalities, and omits first aid for falls, which cause kill about another 25%.  Still omits animal bites (rabies and plague).  

'''Requirement 2''':''From memory, list the seven priorities for survival in a backcountry or wilderness location.  Explain the importance of each one with your counselor.&quot;

Page 20 of the pamphlet states that there is &quot;an order of priority&quot; for seven &quot;priorities for survival&quot; without reference to the actual facts on the ground.  The official priorities are, in this order:

A. &quot;STOP&quot;  (Stop/Think/Observe/Plan, a tool to help you think properly about how to deal with a survival situation and establish what you need to do and in what order.  Admitting there is a problem and thinking about it in a positive, productive, and creative fashion increases the chances for a good outcome.  Control your fears and avoid panic. Decide to live. Focus on what you can do --- not what you cannot do.  Analyze your situation and plan a course of action only after considering all of the aspects of your predicament and keeping in mind your safety at all times. Don't make unnecessarily quick judgments. How you think about your situation is the key to survival in an outdoor emergency. 

B. First Aid - Serious first aid problems need to be dealt with consistent with proper mental approach. First aid may be your top priority.  Scouts are far more likely to have needed first aid information and skills than the general population.  

C. Shelter - Staying at or near 98.6 F is essential to survival. If the survival situation takes place in dangerous cold or heat, getting sheltered as best you can (starting with clothing) is critical -- first priority.   

D. Fire - Fire is not a survival need but a tool that addresses several survival needs, including staying at 98.6 when it is cold; signaling; purifying water; and boosting your morale.  

E. Signaling - If you are lost and want to be found than make yourself visible. A &quot;signal&quot; is something that stands out from the surroundings by virtue of its color, movement, sound or shape.  

F. Water - Water is often critical to survival.  In great heat, water may be needed in a few hours. Dehydration interferes with the functioning of our bodies, including thinking straight. 

G. Food - Food is listed last in the pamphlet and is apparently not regarded as a priority at all: ''Don't worry about food.''
However, food is an important necessity, however, not as important as water. 

COMMENT:
The requirements ignore the need to navigate safety to avoid trouble or deal with it (&quot;self-rescue&quot;) and the needs to conserve energy and sleep.  These are critical omissions and conflict with other official B.S.A. literature..

While the pamphlet discusses the importance of leaving trip information with responsible parties who will &quot;miss&quot; you, that critical tool does not find its way into the requirements.  


'''Requirement 3''':''Discuss ways to avoid panic and maintain a high level of morale when lost, and explain why this [sic] is important.''

COMMENT:
Former editions of the pamphlet required that the candidate explain how to maintain a &quot;positive mental attitude&quot; without expressly explaining how that objective could be accomplished.  The 2008 edition (the 2007 edition with colored pictures) urges in the text (p. 19) &quot;Keep a Positive Attitude,&quot; explained as a &quot;conscious choice to . . . endure.&quot;  It then discusses the STOP process as the invariable first &quot;priority,&quot; implying that STOP is a way to maintain a positive attitude, avoid panic, and maintain morale.

OTHER COMMENTS:
(a) Be positive about your problem situation. Things have gone wrong, but you are NOT helpless.  There ARE things you can do to make the situation better.  As a Scout, you have skills and experience that will help.  Having a shelter and fire (light) built before dark helps you conclude that you are safer and that you will make it through the emergency.  Getting dark? So what? It gets dark on every campout you have experienced.  Noises in the dark?  That's normal.  Nothing new there.  You left a Trip Plan at &quot;home,&quot; so you will be missed, and help will be on the way.

(b)Thinking realistically and creatively are keys to survival. 

'''Requirement 4''':''Describe the steps you would take to survive in the following conditions:
::''a. Cold and snowy''
::''b. Wet (forest)''
::''c. Hot and dry (desert)''
::''d. Windy (mountains or plains)''
::''e. Water (ocean or lake)''

COMMENT:
The pamphlet vastly overrates waterproof-breathable garments and ignores the existence of polyester, dating the material to a period decades ago when the first waterproof-breathables were uncritically hailed, &quot;polypro&quot; was king, and wool was the number 1 insulation layer.  

The pamphlet inconsistently suggests both t-shirts and shorts and long-sleeved shirts and trousers for &quot;hot&quot; weather and shows many illustrations of Scouts at Philmont in t-shirts, shorts and no head ware whatsoever (&quot;Crispy Critters&quot;) 

'''Requirement 5''':''Put together a personal survival kit and explain how each item in it is useful.''

COMMENT:  The text does not explain the reasoning behind a &quot;personal survival Kit&quot; (AKA &quot;PSK&quot;); namely, a collection of basic gear so small and light that one will never be tempted to leave it behind.  The pamphlet confuses a PSK with the &quot;Ten Essentials&quot; approach to selecting gear for a wilderness trek. 

'''Requirement 6''':''Using three differnt methods (other than matches), build and light three fires.''

COMMENT: While the text (p. 29) recognizes that the survival need is an ability to start a fire with something other than &quot;matches and lighters,&quot; the requirement continues to technically allow any means other than matches (such as a butane or propane torch).

Much of the information in the pamphlet on fire-building is incorrect. Hard woods, such as oak, are poor choices for fire-by-friction.  The illustration that accompanies the discussion of natural flint and steel is a ferrocerium rod (man-made &quot;flint&quot; like that in a cigarette lighter or &quot;Hot Spark&quot;), and such a tool would easily be broken if you &quot;strike the steel against the edge of the flint&quot; (not that the ferrocerium rod has an edge)(The correct technique is, of course, to scrape the ferrocerium rod with a sharp, hard edge.)   Charred cloth is not mentioned but is almost essential for most to make fire-by-friction or with natural flint and steel.  Natural &quot;flint&quot; is not common in much of North America.  Best firewood is not &quot;dead and downed,&quot; but is dead and attached to the tree or shrub (The pamphlet amazingly advises that Leave No trace be followed even in a survival situation.  Inconsistently, it also says the opposite.) The Teepee Fire lay has become the only lay illustrated in Scout literature, and it is the only lay illustrated in the pamphlet.  There are other, more effective and secure fire lays, such as the Log Cabin or Hunter's Fire.

'''Requirement 7''':''Do the following:
:''a. Show five different ways to attract attention when lost.
:''b. Demonstrate how to use a signal mirror.''
:''c. Describe from memory five ground-to-air signals and tell what they mean.''

COMMENT:
Smoke signals can be seen for miles and fire is visible even further in the dark. A whistle can be heard for greater distances and uses far less energy than yelling. A mirror or other object that reflects the sun can make you visible to a helicopter or plane. Millions of people have been trained that three flashes, three whistle blasts, three smoke signals - three of any signal - stands for distress (HELP!).

'''Requirement 8''':''Improvise a natural shelter.  For the purposes of this demonstration, use techniques that have little negative impact on the environment. Spend a  night in your shelter.''

COMMENT:
B.S.A. is trapped between Leave No Trace and the wishes of property owners on one side and, on the other, a desire for candidates to learn something about building an expedient shelter from leaves, grasses, and branches.  So they try to have it both ways: &quot;natural&quot; but with &quot;little impact on the environment.&quot; (&quot;Unnatural&quot; materials are only available around Halloween.) A realistic requirement would be to make a shelter from one or two plastic trash bag(s)and a framework of light, dead branches -- unless the situation allows building an expedient shelter from vegetation.  The main &quot;takeaway&quot; from building a brush shelter is that Scouts almost invariably greatly underestimate the time and work required to build a shelter that insulates and keeps out rain.

Be creative and use your surroundings the best you can. The shape of the ground may block wind in some places, as can trees or brush.  If cold, try and find shelter and build a safe fire. If in really hot weather get out of the sun and dry wind. In the cold it may be easier to sleep in the day and stay awake at night by a warm fire. In very hot weather you may also want to seek shelter and/or sleep during the day.  The pamphlet illustrates Scouts inadequately dressed for hot, sunny conditions and gives inconsistent advice on wilderness clothing.

'''Requirement 9''':&quot;&quot;Explain how to protect yourself from insects, reptiles, and bears.''

COMMENT: Omits very significant categories of animals with which there are unpleasant interactions: 1) homo sapiens; 2) rodents and other small mammals

Partial overlap with Requirement 1.

'''Requirement 10''':''Demonstrate three ways to treat water found in the outdoors to prepare it for drinking.''

COMMENT: 
The discussion of chemical disinfecting of water is incorrect.  While they eliminate some risks, chlorine (except Chlorine dioxide) and iodine are not fully reliable to treat wild water according to all private and public authorities (W.M.S.; Red Cross; Mayo Clinic; U.S.C.D.C; U.S. Surgeon General; U.S.E.P.A.), as is pointed out in other B.S.A literature. (Unfortunately, the current Boy Scout Handbook is also incorrect.)

There is inadequate discussion of where water is more likely to be found in nature.  There is no discussion of field-expedient filtering.  Only commercial filters are discussed.
There is no discussion of: digging mini wells next to a body of water; SODIS (q.v.); or boiling without metal containers.  There is no discussion of gathering dew or transpiration bags.

The combination of any commercial filter AND chlorine or iodine is extremely safe.  Newer filters eliminate all microorganisms.

'''Requirement 11''':''Show that you know the proper clothing to wear in your area on an overnight in extremely hot weather and extremely cold weather.''

COMMENT: 
While layers are mentioned, there is no explanation of what materials or construction are used for different layers. Polyester fleece is not mentioned, nor are polyester wicking garments. Though polypropylene is mentioned, it is obsolete when compared to polyester wicking garments.

There is no mention of clothing as a barrier to insects, thorns, poisonous plants, or other sources of abrasions and cuts.

The MBP suggests a brimmed hat for warm weather, omitting the need to avoid sunburn in cold weather.  It repeatedly shows illustrations of Scouts in sunny mountain scenes with no hats whatsoever.

There is no discussion of eye protection from solar radiation in summer or when snow covers the ground.

'''Requirement 12''':''Explain why it usually is not wise to eat edible wild plants or wildlife in a wilderness survival situation.''

COMMENT:
Food is a need but is usually the least important wilderness survival need.  A person can typically survive for many days without food.  While you should use whatever food you have with you, gathering wild food uses energy and is unlikely to produce as many calories of energy as you use up trying to gather it. If you can acquire food easily then go for it. (Eating proteins and carbohydrates increases dehydration if water is in short supply.)

OVERALL COMMENT: There is good information in the MBP, but also internal conflicts, conflicts with other B.S.A. literature, omissions, and simply incorrect information.  There is no table of contents and the material does not track the requirements.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dpopov. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dpopov~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Perl||First Programs}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Getting Started ==

This book assumes that you know absolutely nothing about programming at all and that Perl is your first language. However, basic operations such as making text files are outside of the realm of this tutorial.

=== Obtaining Perl ===

To find out if you already have Perl installed on your computer, go into the command line and type: 
&lt;source lang =&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
perl -v 
&lt;/source&gt;
This will display which version of Perl you have installed on your computer, if it is installed.

There are at least two easy ways to install Perl on Windows: the [http://activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/?_x=1 ActiveState] distribution, and the [http://strawberryperl.com Strawberry Perl] distribution. Both are downloadable as native Windows installers.  ActivePerl has a prebuilt package repository and is supported by a corporation, while Strawberry Perl includes a compiler (gcc) so that perl modules can be installed &quot;on the fly&quot; and is community-supported.

Most Unix-like operating systems will include Perl by default, and Linux Standard Base mandates that all compliant Linuxes ship with Perl installed. However, if for some reason you don't have perl, you can explore the options available to you at the [http://www.perl.com/download.csp main Perl download page], which will provide links to source and binaries.

=== Writing programs ===

==== A Sample Program ====

Perl is an ''interpreted'' language, which means you will always need the Perl interpreter which will ''compile'' and ''execute'' your program each time you run it. Instead of compiling your program into bytecode like in [[Pascal]] or [[C++]] and then executing it, you can simply copy your program's source code to a different computer (that has the perl interpreter) and run it. 

For our first example, run your favorite text editor, and type something like this:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

print &quot;Hello World&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you don't understand this yet, don't worry; This will be explained in more depth later. 

Save the file as '''myprog.pl''' and you have a perl program ready to run.

=== Running programs ===

==== Windows ====

To run a perl program with a modern version of [http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActivePerl ActivePerl] installed, you simply click on it. If the screen flashes and you can't see the output you might have to execute the file from within the windows shell (ie. cmd.exe or PowerShell).  With [http://strawberryperl.com/ Strawberry Perl], you'll have to execute a perl program from the command line as shown below. 

From a windows command-line interface, you can run the program thusly:

 C:\&gt; perl path\to\foo\myprog.pl

or, if perl.exe is not in your path:

 C:\&gt; c:\perl\bin\perl.exe myprog.pl

''Note: You may have to specify the full path to your program unless you are running the command prompt in that directory.''

==== UNIX-like Systems ====

You can run a perl program by running perl itself, and telling the shell the name of the file:

 perl myprog.pl

Usually, perl programs are made executable on their own. This involves two changes to the sample program. First, edit it and put the following [[w:Shebang (Unix)|shebang line]] at the top of the file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, at a command prompt, make your program executable by using chmod.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
chmod +x myprog.pl
&lt;/source&gt;

Your program is now executable and ready to run, just like any other file. To execute, type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
./myprog.pl
&lt;/source&gt;

By convention, .pl identifies a perl script, and .pm a perl library. The .pl file extension isn't needed for either of these examples; it's just a useful way of identifying files. The only time the convention ''should'' be violated is if the program is to be installed outside of the current working directory, and there runs a chance you might want to some day rewrite them in a different language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A. Getting started, displaying text ==

Task: Create a Perl program which displays &quot;Hello world&quot; and then exits.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
# !/usr/bin/perl

#helloWorld.pl

#Program to display &quot;Hello world&quot;

print &quot;Hello world&quot;;

#End of program.
&lt;/source&gt;

==B. Displaying numbers ==

i) Put the number 4000/7 into a variable, and display it on screen.

ii) Adapt the program to display the number to 3 decimal places.  (Hint: This is possible using integer math before the final calculation.)

iii) Adapt the program to round up if the last decimal place is greater than 5

iv) Adapt the program to display the number with leading zeros

v) Adapt the program to show a + sign if the number is positive, and check that it correctly displays a - sign if you subtract 1000 from the number.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/user/bin/perl

#displayNumberOnScreen.pl

$divisionResult = 4000/7;
print &quot;Result of 4000 divided by 7 is $divisionResult&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

==C. Functions ==

Write a function to calculate the roots of a [[w:Quadratic formula|quadratic equation]], where you give the coefficients a,b,c to the function, and it returns both values of x

==D. Putting it all together ==

Put together these programs into one which:
* Displays a title on screen
* Creates 3 random numbers (a,b,c)
* Displays those numbers neatly formatted
* Uses those numbers as the coefficients of a quadratic equation, calculates and displays both roots.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==A. Input from the keyboard ==

# Write a program which asks for a line of text to be entered on the keyboard, and then displays that text on screen.
# Modify the program to ask for 3 lines of text, and display them on one line with a | symbol between each input.

== Input from the command-line ==

Write a program which you can call like so:

 perl myscript.pl &quot;Argument 1&quot; &quot;Argument 2&quot; &quot;Argument 3&quot;

The program should take as many command-line arguments as are available, and display them on screen.

== Input from a text file ==

Create a text file containing the following 3 lines:

 This is line one
 This is line two
 This is line threes

Write a program which reads the file, and displays all the lines of text.  Modify it so that the whole file is output on one line with | characters between each input.

== Putting it all together ==

Using the program from exercise 1, write a program which takes three numbers as command-line arguments, and solves the quadratic equation where those numbers are the roots.

If no numbers are available from the command-line, prompt the user to type each number at the keyboard.

If the first command-line argument is -h or --help, display some instructions on how to use the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reading and writing files ==

Write a program to read a file from disk, and save it as a new text file. (make sure you're not working with an important document!)  Try downloading a public-domain book [http://www.gutenberg.org/] to test how your program works with large text files.

== Using regular expressions to search text ==

Modify your program to copy only lines of text which start with &quot;Chapter 1&quot; or other such identifier.  Try identifying each chapter number as it's found and doing some simple maths with it.  Display the number of chapters in the book, with how many lines each chapter contains.

Put a regular-expression in to search for repeated repeated words in the text.  Make it find repetitions even when the capitalisation of the words is different.

Try to search for words beginning in de and ending in a vowel.  Write a search to identify numbers in the text, whether they've got decimal places, - signs, etc.  If you want, you can try to find them if they're written as text.

How many distinct proper nouns are there in the book you've selected?  How many questions?

== Doing search-and-replace ==

Modify the file-copy program so that it searches for each instance of one word, and replaces it with another word in the output file.  Check that the program has operated correctly.  Would you trust it with an important document yet?

Write a program to capitalise the first letter of each sentence, and test it.  Make sure it's not being misled by full-stops in numbers, abbreviations, and titles.

Write a program to search for numbers in a book, and add 10 to each number.  Write a program to search for expressions in brackets (10+3/2) and replace them with the result (11.5).  Check that it doesn't do anything dangerous when you write (print &quot;hello&quot;;) some code in the expressions.

== Benchmarking your programs ==

Using either the Time::HiRes module, or a benchmarking module, modify one of your programs to display the time taken to run.

Try using a benchmarking system to identify which line of code takes the longest to run on one of your programs.  Which line of code gets run the most often?

== Putting it all together ==

Write a program which searches a directory for files which match a supplied regular-expression.  Display how long it took to run the program on a particular set of directories.

Modify the program to search a directory-tree, rather than just one directory.

Test how different search requests affect the time taken to do the search.  See if you can find a regular-expression which never finishes (hit ctrl-c to stop a busy Perl program).  Then try to re-write that regular-expression to do the same job but faster.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Documenting your program ==

Using a technique called &quot;Plain old Documentation&quot; (POD), take one of your Perl programs, and write about what it does, how it works, and what options it accepts.  You will need to write the documentation in the same file as the Perl program, using the special POD markup language [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html]

Check that your program still runs correctly with the documentation embedded in it.

Using the pod2text tool, create a text-file help file for your program, and check that it's nicely formatted and easy to read.  (You will need to run a conversion program to extract the documentation from your program into a text-file)

== Creating HTML documentation ==

Using the POD toolkit, extract the documentation from your Perl program into an HTML file.  Open the HTML file with your browser and check it's nicely formatted and easy to read.

If you like to use LaTeX or man, try compiling your documentation as LaTeX or Troff files, respectively.

== Writing a test-suite ==

Find a testing framework which will allow you to write tests for your Perl program, to automatically test its functionality.  Taking a complex program from a previous exercise, write tests which check for correct behaviour in each part of your program.

Insert a deliberate error in the program being tested, and check that the error is spotted by the test-suite.  See whether you can make the program display incorrect results and still pass the test-suite. (if so, modify the test-suite to detect this incorrect version of the program)

Re-write the program from scratch using a different method for some of the functions.  Check that the new program passes your test-suite.

== Putting it all together ==

Write a program which scans a Perl script and displays the size of the program, the number of comments, and calculates the density of the program (number of statements divided by lines of code)

Display the value of the program by looking-up an estimate of how much it costs per line of code to develop a program in industry.  

Display the estimated number of errors in the program by looking-up the expected number of errors per thousand lines of code for an average program.

Write the documention and test-suite for your new program.

Download a random perl script from the internet, and see how it matches up on your code-quality meter.

== Temperature Converter ==

Write a program that takes in a temperature (either Celsius or Fahrenheit) and converts it. The program will know what to convert it to through interpreting the last character in the input string, which will either be an 'F' (for Fahrenheit) or a 'C' (for Celsius). So, for example if the user were to input 10C, the program will output 50F (the output should be to the nearest whole integer).
If the end character in the input string is not equivalent to an F or a C, the program should handle the error appropriately. 

For extra points, have the program print out its opinion on the temperature. For example, if the user were to input 50F, the program would say &quot;10C, that's cold!&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{prognav|Active Server Pages|Prerequisites|Your first page}}

The most important difference between ASP and ASP.Net is that ASP uses interpreted VBScript or JScript, and ASP.net uses any .Net language (including VB.Net, C#, J#, etc.) ''compiled''.

ASP 3.0 left all its code in the front of the application. There was no way for a programmer to &quot;hide&quot; the sensitive code which he or she may not want anybody to see. The fact that the code was interpreted also slowed performance. ASP.NET allows the programmer to create dynamic link libraries containing the sensitive code. This may be a disadvantage from an open-source perspective but compiling code into dll's greatly improves performance.

ASP.NET is firmly rooted in XML. Customarily, the dlls that ASP.NET creates start out as namespaces. All of the classes in the namespaces are then compiled into a single dll binary.

#ASP is mostly written using VB Script and HTML intermixed. Presentation and business logic is intermixed while ASP.NET can be written in several .NET compliant languages such as C# or VB.NET.
#ASP has maximum of 4 built in classes like Request, Response, Session and Application whereas ASP.NET using .NET framework classes which has more than 2000 built-in classes.
#ASP does not have any server based components whereas ASP.NET offers several server based components like Button, TextBox etc. and event driven processing can be done at server.
#ASP doesn't support Page level transactions whereas ASP.NET supports Page level transactions.
#ASP.NET offers web development for mobile devices which alters the content type (wml or chtml etc.) based on the device.
#ASP.NET allows separation of business and presentation logic because the code need not be included directly in the *.aspx page.
#ASP.NET uses languages which are fully object oriented languages like C# and also supports cross language support.
#ASP.NET offers support for Web Services and rich data structures like DataSet which allows disconnected data processing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary Project==
I have written a [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokeng.htm program for learning vocabulary]. 
It is based on the belief that it is best to learn foreign words by learning typical sentences. The program can also be used for learning other stuff that works with the question/answer scheme, e.g. the theory for the driving licence or anatomy. Unfortunately I wrote it in qbasic, which can be downloaded [http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_s/1.0/W95/EN-US/olddos.exe here]. It also uses images and sound files for alternation and in order to work on the pronunciation. If you are interested let me know. I currently have files in English, French (with sound), Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan. Corrections or additions are very welcome. The easiest thing to start with for improvements would be adding new vocabulary, sound files or images. A guide to the program will follow soon, although I think it is rather self-explanatory. In the long run the program should be rewritten in a better language. Afterwards it should be possible to switch languages within the program. Up to now there is a different version of the program for each language.

Note for Mac users: It seems to me that this page describes how to use qbasic on a Mac: http://www.robotstore.com/download/Stamps_on_iMac_2.13.pdf
Please let me know if this is helpful.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Branko. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Branko~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hallo Cyril,
da Du an der Spanischlehrbuchseite schreibst, dachte ich, vielleicht interessiert es Dich, dass ich ein [http://amor.rz.hu-berlin.de/~h0444e1w/vokdeu.htm Vokabelprogramm] geschrieben habe. Es basiert auf der Überzeugung, dass man fremde Wörter am besten lernen kann, indem man typische Sätze lernt. Das Programm kann auch für andere Dinge verwendet werden, die sich nach dem Frage-Antwort-Schema lernen lassen, z.B. Theorie für die Führerscheinprüfung oder Anatomie. Leider sind meine Programmierkünste recht rudimentär, deswegen habe ich es in qbasic geschrieben. Die Sprache kann [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/download/olddos.exe hier] heruntergeladen werden. Das Programm bindet Bilder und Ton ein, zur Abwechslung und um die Aussprache zu verbessern. Wenn es Dich interessiert, lass es mich wissen. Ich habe derzeit Dateien auf Französisch (mit Aussprachebeispielen von Mme Maeder), Spanisch und English. Katalanisch und Portugiesisch sind in Arbeit. Korrekturen und Erweiterungen sind herzlich willkommen. Mittelfristig sollte das Programm in einer besseren Sprache wie Visual Basic neu geschrieben werden. Danach sollte es möglich sein, zwischen Bedienungssprachen zu wechseln. Bisher gibt es noch eine eigene Programmversion für jede Sprache.

By R. Cedric Leonard

Have you ever wondered why our system of letters is called an alphabet? The word is actually the combination of the Greek names of the first two characters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and beta. But where did the Greeks get these names? Why call the letters alpha, beta, gamma, delta, etc., in the first place? 

These are merely the Greek variation of the Phoenician names aleph, beth, gimel, deleth, etc., and these are actual words in the Phoenician language for ox, house, camel, door, etc. There are several theories as to why these names were applied to the characters in this manner, none of which have been proven. The two prevailing theories at present are: 1) the characters so-named came from earlier pictograms of those objects; 2) each character so-named was the initial sound for that object. 

But the scholarly world is in complete disarray when it comes to the question of the origin of the characters. That the Greek alphabet (and most later European alphabets) is basically made up from the earlier Phoenician letters is clear. But the big question is, how did the Phoenicians come by these letters? Evidence indicates that at least some (about four) were invented on the spot (just as the Greeks invented several for their vowels). But what about the rest? 

For want of a plausible theory, Dr. I. J. Gelb, Professor at the Oriental Institute and the Department of Linguistics of the University of Chicago, suggests that the entire Phoenician system of signs is an arbitrary invention throughout. Let's take an entirely different tack. Let's assume the Glozel Tablets (believed by many to be authentic and infinitely older than the Phoenician) are the key to the puzzle. Let's make a comparison between several &quot;western&quot; systems and the Glozel characters. 

The Azilian, Iberian and Berber character-sets all correspond somewhat to that found on the Glozel Tablets. The &quot;Proto-Sinaitic&quot; inscriptions discovered on cliffs near Luxor, Egypt may represent a contributing factor. And even though the correspondences of several of the characters with its associated &quot;hieroglyphic original&quot; seem somewhat strained, there is little doubt that certain Egyptian hieroglyphs contributed to the overall Proto-Canaanite system.
 
My contention is that the final Phoenician (an &quot;eastern&quot; system) was cribbed mainly from a &quot;western&quot;. However it should be mentioned, that just as in the hieroglyph/sinai conversion, the character-shapes correspond--but not necessarily their phonic values. 

Professor Johannes Friedrich, archeologist and linguist at the Free University of Berlin, implies that the Berber alphabet of North Africa may have been a relatively late invention--the earliest inscriptions appearing only in the 2nd century B.C.--therefore some of its characters may have been based on the Phoenician (Punic) script, rather than vice versa. 

He writes: &quot;The political and cultural independence of the Numidians manifested itself also in the creation of an alphabetic . . . script which has been preserved in our days in more than a thousand inscriptions.&quot; He adds: &quot;A variant of this script is still being used today by the desert tribes of the Tuareg.&quot; (Friedrich, 1957) The independence spoken of was acquired with the backing of the Romans early in the 2nd century B.C. 

But what about the inscriptions discovered among the Berbers of the Canary Islands? In 1878 French anthropologist Dr. Rene R. Verneau discovered rock carvings in the ravines of Las Balos that bear similarities with Libyan or Numidic writing from the time of Roman occupation or earlier. In other locations the older Libyco-Berber (T'ifinagh) script has been identified. (Verneau, 1881) 

Keep in mind that we are comparing several &quot;western&quot; (i.e., Azilian, Berber, Iberian, Numidian, Glozel) with the alphabet supposedly INVENTED by the Phoenicians. The similarities are simply too great. The Phoenicians obviously did not invent their character-set known today as the alphabet. They discovered it in their travels to the west from a source dating back at least 12,000 years (i.e., the Glozel and Azilian). 

Just as a footnote to all this riggamaroll about characters and alphabets (included because this also is a fact not widely known), the early Biblical Hebrews (from about the time of King Solomon until after the Babylonian captivity) used the Phoenician alphabet. In other words, whether they wrote on parchment or inscribed on stone, they wrote utilizing Phoenician characters. The earliest known Hebrew inscription is the famed Moabite Stone (dated 9th Cent. B.C.). It is written in the Hebrew language, but with Phoenician characters. The so-called &quot;Hebrew&quot; or block characters we are so familiar with today belong to the Aramaic alphabet, not the Hebrew. 

To those of you who hung in there through all this jargon, I congratulate you. I hope I have stimulated some thinking in regards to alphabets and their origins. Whether you agree with me or not, I think the link between the Glosel Tablets and Atlantis is reasonably solid. It just may be that we owe our form of writing to the lost Atlanteans of antiquity.

©1984  by Erich A. von Fange    http://www.creationism.org/vonfange/ 
  
Chapter 9:  IS THERE AN IDEAL ALPHABET?

* http://www.creationism.org/vonfange/vonFangeSpadingChap09.htm

All would agree that the ideal alphabet would have one and only one letter for each speech sound, with perhaps a few concessions made for common compound sounds to be represented by a single symbol. For example, the long &quot;i&quot; sound in English is clearly a combination of two separate vowel sounds, and we would find it awkward to use two symbols to represent that familiar sound today. Accepting the genius of the invention of the alphabet, it is more than a little strange that no alphabet in common use in the world has ever reached this goal (Sturtevant, 1947, p. 24). It is of course somewhat arbitrary which sounds uttered by the human voice are to be recognized and dignified with a symbol. Yet strangely, all alphabets omit symbols for some common vocal sounds, and all contain redundant letters, that is, letters that represent sounds already provided for by other symbols. We can illustrate the idea of redundant letters by looking at ways one might spell out the sound of -ks as in &quot;marks.&quot; One might spell it -CS as in lilacs, or -X as in box or -Q's, -CKS, -KES, or -CHS. On the surface this may appear simply as another case of human stupidity or as a consequence of borrowing from different languages. Those who have attempted to reform the alphabet for the best of reasons have all failed. Our alphabet seems to be tamper-proof. We know that ancient Egypt had an alphabet of 24 symbols and chose not to develop its communication system by this means. The Chinese also in the most ancient times had an alphabet but elected to develop its present complex system instead. From these odd facts one can only conclude that some other very compelling factor entered into the formation of the ancient alphabet (Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th ed., Macrop., 1:627). 

According to Moran (1969, p. 13, 28), religion is the only imaginable organizing principle behind the alphabet. Although some kinds of worship may well have sprung up independently, e.g., sun worship, the slaughter of a bull at the time of the spring equinox on both the altars of Ur and in the Valley of the Man in China shows common roots in a common culture. The 12 signs of the zodiac (the twelve constellations), the 12 months known throughout the ancient world of Europe, Asia, and North Africa point to a common source. The 52-year cycle was used both in the Orient and in pre-Columbian American cultures with 13 days of houses in a quarter. Lunar and solar calendars were brought into correspondence by the cycle of 52. The 52-card deck with 13 cards to a suit faithfully reproduces ancient calendrical knowledge. Even the Joker serves a calendrical function for leap years. The twelve signs of the solar zodiac may be in some way derived from the lunar zodiac of 27-28 signs. The relationship of the two is very unclear, but many of the same stars are involved in both sets of signs. From this well of astronomical and astrological knowledge, the alphabet was drawn. 

To establish the source for the alphabet, one must show its great antiquity, wide diffusion, and some powerful cohesive principle outside itself in order to hold the signs in established order despite circumstances, time, and geography. 

Gustavus Seyffarth, a 19th century scholar and rival of Champollion on the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics, served for a time in the 1850's on the faculty of Concordia Theological Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri. He understood two things clearly in our context which he expressed in his many writings. He was one of the first to grasp the idea that much actual history was concealed in myth and legend. Further he realized the overwhelming importance of the heavens in the life and culture of ancient man. Although Seyffarth is wrong in some of his conclusions, and though some of his work is necessarily conjectural, his voluminous works deserve careful study and reworking. He saw the connection between the alphabet and the skies about 150 years before this principle was rediscovered  by  Moran  and Kelley (1969). Seyffarth states: 

It is said and believed that our alphabet was invented by Cadmus in 1500 B.C., but this cannot be considered a historical fact. In the New Testament we read of a book that was written by Enoch 900 years prior to the Deluge. Pliny said that man always had literature. The Vedas and Avesta tell us that prior to the Deluge sacred books existed and that, in consequence of their loss, the human race became so wicked that the Creator resolved to destroy it. 

The Koran (Sura 57) mentions that Noah was the author of a book... It is true that Cadmus invented the alphabet, but Cadmus means &quot;ancestor,&quot; i.e., Noah. Cadmus was, like the latter, the first planter of the vineyard. 

All these and similar traditions concur in demonstrating that the alphabet existed prior to the Deluge... The Noachian alphabet was a representation of the zodiac. 

Seyffarth held that our alphabet is a reproduction of the zodiac with the constellation of the planets at a point in time of 3446 B.C., Septuagint chronology, apparently at the end of the Flood, probably according to the observation of Noah himself. Seyffarth translates Phoenician, Chinese, Chaldean, Greek, and Roman myths which clearly related the formulation of the alphabet to the zodiac (Seyffarth, 1886, p. 53-54). 

An idea explored by both Seyffarth and Wadler much later focuses on the peculiar placement of the vowels in the alphabet. There is no logical sense in their location in our present alphabet, nor in any other alphabet where they are included: Abcd Efgh Ijklmn Opqrst Uv(W)x(Y)z. Wadler noted that the ancients associated the vowels as follows with the &quot;7&quot; planets: ao-Sun. i-Moon, a-Mars, e-Mercury, o-Jupiter, aw-Venus, oo-Saturn (Wadler, 1948. p. 103). Thus the intriguing notion has arisen that vowels and unneeded letters in some ancient alphabets may represent the position of the planets among the houses of the lunar zodiac, that is, the consonants, at a critical point in human history. Perhaps one reason Seyffarth's discussions have not been studied seriously is the common belief that any use of the concept of the zodiac involves astrology. In the ancient world there was no necessary connection. The above discussion is in no way connected with what we understand today as astrology. Unfortunately, Seyffarth was less than clear on just which alphabet he had in mind in ancient times that included vowels and apparently &quot;useless&quot; letters to indicate the location of the planets within the lunar zodiac at a crucial moment in history. 

Moran's theory is that the alphabet was derived from 28-30 lunar signs, and that some of the signs are the actual appearance of a given constellation. Moran argues that the lunar zodiac is older than the solar zodiac. In support of his theory, he notes that there are startling correspondences between the lunar and the alphabetical signs (Moran, 1969, p. xiv-xviii).</text>

The Greek alphabet came from the Phonecians around the year 900 B.C. When the Phonecians invented the alphabet there were 600 symbols. Those symbols took up too much room on the papyrus, so they narrowed it down to 22 symbols. The Greeks borrowed some of the symbols and then they made up some of their own. But the Phonecians, like other cultures, used their symbols to represent consonants and vowel sounds together. The Greeks were the first people to have separate symbols (or letters) to represent vowel sounds. Even the name &quot;alphabet&quot; comes from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet -- &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta.&quot; All later alphabets came from the Greek alphabet.

THE EVOLUTION OF WRITING
By R. Cedric Leonard

* http://www.atlantisquest.com/evolution.html
* http://www.atlantisquest.com/classical.html
* http://www.atlantisquest.com/tab6.gif

&quot;THE very interesting problem of the 'origins' of writing is shrouded in a cloud of darkness and is as hard to interpret as the 'origins' of art, architecture, religion, and social institutions, to name only a few of the important aspects of our culture.&quot; In this statement Dr. I. J. Gelb (1974), Professor of Linguistics at the University of Chicago, is referring to the so-called 'beginning of writing' in the Mesopotamian Valley slightly more than 5,000 years ago (the two tablets shown on the title page are examples). But the true origin of writing may be even more mysterious--and it may have occurred much earlier than commonly supposed. 

How did writing began? Most epigraphers and paleographers agree that the historical evolution of writing occurred in basically four stages: 1) Ideographic; 2) Logographic; 3) Syllabic; 4) Alphabetic. It can be seen from this that alphabetic writing is considered the most advanced of the evolutionary stages (Gelb, 1974). 

The development of writing is unidirectional. This means that it will pass through the above four stages in that order and no other. No system of writing can begin naturally with the syllabic or alphabetic stage; if such a case did occur, it could only happen if influenced by another system which had already passed through the earlier stages. A writing system can stop at any given stage (a case of arrested development); it can combine stages as it passes from one stage to another; or it can continue to use more than one stage forever. But no writing system ever studied has ever skipped a stage. This observation led Prof. Gelb to an important discovery concerning the Egyptian and Western Semitic systems which will be discussed. 

I will describe the four major stages in extremely brief terms. 

In the ideographic stage there is absolutely no relationship between what is transcribed and actual speech sounds. It is basically composed of pictures and readily discerned symbols, designed so that the message is obvious. An example is that practiced among the American Indians before the arrival of the Europeans. 

The next stage is the logographic (word-sign) in which each written sign stands for a word in the spoken language, and maintains basically a one-to-one relationship to the spoken words. If one wanted to say &quot;tree,&quot; he drew a picture or a symbol of a tree. If one wanted to say &quot;three trees,&quot; he could either draw three trees, or he could precede the picture of a tree with a numerical symbol having the meaning &quot;three&quot;. However, some things are not so easily pictured. 

Abstractions, such as life, love, beauty, etc., were difficult to express in this manner. The usual device to overcome this difficulty was the use of homonyms (words with the same sounds). For instance, the ancient Sumerian word for &quot;life&quot; was ti. The same Sumerian word also meant &quot;arrow&quot;. It was easy enough to incise an arrow, which could be read as &quot;life&quot; if the context demanded it. This technique of expression is also known as rebus writing. 

Proper names presented a greater difficulty. As long as names like White Cloud and Running Bear were used there was no problem. But how do you write down names like Assurbanipal, Shalmanezer or Zephnathpaaneah using a logogram? This led to phonetization. 

The next major stage is the syllabary. The principle of phonetization arose when words could not be indicated by mere pictures. This vital step occurred when complex words were &quot;sounded out&quot; using separate signs. Thus each sign represented a single syllable (a consonant followed by a vowel sound). Such a system is known as a syllabary. 

With logographic writing thousands of word-signs have to be memorized in order to have a good working vocabulary of the language to be written. Also, over a period of time once easily recognizable pictures become conventionalized to the point where they must be memorized in order to be recognized. In a syllabary the number of signs to be memorized drops to a few hundred. 

Even in a syllabary, to delineate each vowel sound following the initial consonantal sound would require a large number of written signs (especially since some syllables also end with a consonantal sound which may be different from the initial sound). But since everyone in a given culture already knows how to pronounce the words, it is possible to eliminate differentiations in vowel sounds with a minimum of sacrifice in accuracy. In such systems, the sound of a or e was understood as standard. Sometimes a few of the leftover signs from the preceding logographic system were retained for use as determinatives. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, which lasted some 3,000 years, retained a large number of logograms until its extinction. 

However, all such 'trimmed down' syllabic systems ran into one common problem: LONG vowels! In the Western Semitic system (Phoenician, Amorite, Hebrew, etc) long vowels were absolutely necessary in expressing plurals. Something had to be done to let the reader know when a given vowel should be long rather than short. The answer was plenic writing. Plenic writing incorporated the use of the so-called &quot;weak&quot; consonants (such a w and y) to substitute for a long vowel sound (usually w for long &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; and y for long &quot;i&quot;). It is the use of plenic writing which has led to the misidentification of these systems of writing as &quot;consonantal alphabets,&quot; when in reality they are syllabaries. 

Paleographers saw these &quot;weak&quot; syllabic signs as mere vowels, and consequently interpreted plenic writing to be a development toward a partial or incomplete vowel system for the so-called &quot;consonantal alphabets&quot; rather than for what it really was. It was because of this misconception that the Phoenicians were accredited with &quot;inventing&quot; the first alphabet. But plenic writing has been found in a number of other systems which are assuredly and definitely syllabic. It has been through comparisons of all these systems of writing that the error was finally recognized. Prof. Gelb sees the distinction as extremely important in studying the evolution of the structure of writing systems. 

However, plenic writing did make clear the dire need to express all the vowel sounds in every word to further improve accuracy in the transmission of knowledge, which led to the development of a true alphabet. 

This brings us to the alphabetic stage of writing. We have just seen that the so-called &quot;alphabet&quot; used by the Phoenicians was in reality a syllabary incorporating the technique of plenic writing. The so-called &quot;vowels&quot; of plenic writing are in reality no vowels at all, but rather certain syllabic signs used as memnic devices to alert the reader to the presence of a long vowel-sound. 

It is to the Greeks that the credit must go for the invention of a true alphabet; since the addition of a few more signs representing true vowel-sounds (which enabled them to follow each initial consonantal sound with the appropriate vowel-sound), accomplished the final result of &quot;a single character for every single sound,&quot; which is the definition of a true alphabet. 

Evolution of letters from early Phoenician to the Roman

So where does this leave the Phoenicians and the Atlanteans? The most that we can accredit the Phoenicians with is the forms of the characters used in their system. And, as we have seen, these may have come from Atlantis! At least, they may have been &quot;western&quot; rather than &quot;eastern&quot; in origin. The letters on this page (since they evolved from the &quot;Phoenician alphabet&quot;) may have had their origin in Atlantis! That question is explored in the articles on the controversial Glozel Tablets, and classical testimony which add weight to this hypothesis.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
By R. Cedric Leonard

According to ancient Greek legends Cadmus was a Phoenician prince who founded Thebes in Boeotia, and among several other things invented the alphabet. In spite of the popularity of this tradition (supported by Herodotus, 450 B.C.), this was doubted even in ancient times. For instance, Tacitus says: 

The Egyptians also claim to have invented the alphabet, which the Phoenicians . . . appropriated the glory, giving out that they had discovered what they had really been taught. (Annals 11.14) 

We know now that as early as 3,000 B.C. the beginnings of a writing system existed on Crete, and by 2,000 B.C. the Minoans were in possession of a syllabic &quot;alphabet&quot;1 which we have named Linear A (Jackson, 1981). And this was hundreds of years before Cadmus' time. We have learned also that, far from being illiterate as once thought, the Achaean Greeks modified Linear A slightly in order to use it for their own language (Linear B). In other words, the Achaean Greeks were using an alphabet hundreds of years before the &quot;Phoenician&quot; version of the alphabet was introduced into Greece at the time of the Dorian invasion. 

It is a given that the Roman letters we use today evolved from the actual characters used by the Phoenicians of the Near East. But did the Phoenicians invent the letters, or did they merely learn of them from earlier sources. Diodorus (1st Cent. B.C.) expresses caution in the acceptance of this Phoenician &quot;invention&quot;: 

Men tell us . . . that the Phoenicians were not the first to make the discovery of letters; but that they did no more than change the form of the letters; whereupon the majority of mankind made use of the way of writing them as the Phoenicians devised. (Lib. Hist., Book V). 

There are ancient and venerable traditions which point to a western, rather than an eastern, origin of our alphabet. In the same work Diodorus mentions that the Phoenicians had discovered a marvelous Atlantic island during their excursions outside Gibraltar. Atlantis was long gone, of course, but the survivors of that catastrophe still existed on the Canary Islands (and possibly others) and it is known that the Guanches inhabiting those islands possessed a system of characters with which the Phoenicians could have been familiar. 

Manetho (250 B.C.) also recorded that the Egyptians themselves derived the elements of their writing from an island in the west. Ancient Egyptian papyri also attribute the invention of writing to the god Thoth who ruled a &quot;Western Domain&quot; (Book of the Dead, Chap. LXXXV). These same papyri declare that Thoth came from an Island of Flame (Atlantis was very volcanic, and perished in flames). The Turin Papyrus (1300 B.C.) lists Thoth as one of the ten kings who reigned during the &quot;reign of the gods,&quot; more than 12,000 years ago. 

Strabo, the Greek historian, records a tradition that Tartessos (on the Atlantic coast of Spain) had written records that go back 7,000 years before their time (500 B.C.), which is equivalent to saying that writing was being utilized on the Atlantic coast of Spain 9,500 years ago. These are strong traditions suggesting the existence of an older, unnamed culture in the west that had long been familiar with the art of writing. 

One of the most important finds are the several hundreds of stones dating from the final stages of the Ice Age in a cave at Mas d'Azil in France. The 12,000-year-old Azilian rocks are painted with designs &quot;which show astonishing similarity with later Greek and Latin letters&quot; (Behn, 1948). Some experts have speculated that the cave might have been a writing school for Ice Age children. 

Also, there are the bone calendars (date 20,000 B.C.), which until properly analyzed, could possibly represent a form of writing according to experts in anthropology and paleography (Marshack, 1972). Can a relationship be demonstrated between some of the better known western &quot;alphabetic&quot; (syllabic) writing systems and our Glozel prototype? The answer is, &quot;Yes!&quot; 

First, there are the inscriptions on the Canary Islands (especially those on Hierro and Grand Canary): the script resembles Numidian and appears to be composed of some twenty four characters and a number of ideograms (Cline, 1953). There is also a &quot;kinship&quot; recognized between some of these Canary Island scripts and the Iberian and Sinai &quot;alphabets&quot; (Wolfel, 1942). 

The Numidian (Berber) writing is &quot;alphabetic&quot; (technically a syllabary; Gelb, 1974). The Tuaregs of North Africa speak Tamachek, but their written language, T'ifinagh, is also &quot;alphabetic&quot; (syllabic) and is closely related to the Basque language. T'ifinagh is being forgotten before it can be either properly classified or translated (Friedrich, 1957). The close similarity between all these &quot;western&quot; systems, and their difference from the &quot;eastern&quot; cuneiform (Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Hittite, Ugaritic) systems cannot be ignored. 

Even the Aymara Indians living along the shores of Lake Titicaca in South America were in possession of an ideographic form of writing when the Spanish conquistadors appeared on the scene (in spite of a ban on writing put in effect by the 63rd Inca ruler, Topu Gaui Pachacuti). Some of these signs correspond exactly to the characters found on the Canary Island tablets and among the Tuaregs and Berbers in North Africa (Wilkins, 1946). 

Does all this sound familiar somehow? Basques, Berbers, Tuaregs, Guanches, and even the Aymaras of South America? We are talking about the same areas, the same people, the same language, and the same culture called &quot;Atlantic&quot; by learned scholars. In other words, our Cro-Magnon-Atlanteans. 

There must have been a &quot;western&quot; prototype (which I believe we have in the Glozel Tablets), completely independent of the eastern writing system which evolved later in Sumar, for all these &quot;Atlantic&quot; systems to be so much alike. Prof. W. Z. Ripley (1899) agrees: &quot;A system of writing seems also to have been invented in western Europe as far back as the Stone Age.&quot; We will demonstrate the validity of this startling statement in the article entitled Ancient Alphabets Compared. 

1It is demonstrated on this website that all the so-called &quot;alphabets&quot; before the Greek invention of the vowel signs are technically syllabaries, but the topic under discussion here is the characters which form the components of these early writing systems. [Back]

Barry B. Powell, Homer and the Origin of the Greek Alphabet. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991. Pp. xxv, 280. ISBN 0521371570. 
Reviewed by Mabel L. Lang, Bryn Mawr College.

Some may question whether making the case for Wade-Gery's 1949 suggestion that the Greek alphabet may have been fashioned explicitly in order to record hexametric verse is worth doing at all; Powell has shown in this book that it is worth doing well. Replete with maps, chronological charts, and a careful review of all possibly relevant evidence, alphabetical, epigraphical and Homeric, the case as presented here still rests ultimately more on possibilities and a willingness to believe than on demonstrable probabilities.

First, in Chapter 1, a survey of what can be known about the creation of the Greek alphabet from the West Semitic syllabary is seen to suggest a single Euboian adapter working with a Phoenician informant about 800 B.C., first learning in their proper order the names and shapes of the signs and then experimenting with the usefulness of their phonetic values for the writing of Greek words: converting to use as vowels those four Semitic signs the names of which, at least, represent sounds rather than consonants (alf, he, yod, ain) and splitting off from the consonant wau its vocalic counterpart; and attempting, with some confusion, to find uses for all four Semitic sibilants.

The product, or Ur-alphabet, being transmitted first to colonists and neighbors, then throughout Greece, incurred the variations characteristic of the epichoric alphabets as a result of error, ignorance, or efforts to simplify or differentiate. The argument is intricate and masterly in its use particularly of the supplemental letters (phi, chi, psi) to show how the adapter, in inventing the chi-form and psi-form as signs for aspirated kappa and koppa (just as he had invented the phi-form for aspirated pi, imitating his use of Semitic tet for aspirated tau), set the stage for the division between the so-called &quot;blue&quot; (chi-form for chi) and &quot;red&quot; (psi-form for chi) epichoric alphabets. Why the chi-form as xi is first of the supplementals in the Etruscan abecedaria (derived from Euboia) is not explained even though that value is seen to be a subsequent abbreviation of the adapter's chi-sigma when the psi-form's use as chi made the chi-form redundant.

Powell demonstrates the nature of the adapter's alphabet by using it to record the first ten lines of the Iliad. He does not, however, explain the several anomalies in the writing. Why, for example, is contraction for the sake of the meter noted inconsistently (MU/RI' *A)XAI/OIS and D' E)TELEI/ETO but A)/LGEA E)/QHKE, DE\ I)FQI/MOUS and TE A)/R) despite regular contraction in the earliest verse inscriptions? Why is the chi-form used for chi before alpha (*A)XAI/OIS), iota (*AXILH=OS), and upsilon (YUXA/S) while the psi-form is used for chi before omicron (XOLWQEI/S)? Why are the two o-sounds in H(RW/WN represented by one vowel while the two e-sounds in E)TELEI/ETO both appear? Is the omission of a metrically necessary digamma in A)/NAC a mistake like the rho for pi in PA=SI and the omitted kappa in O)LE/KONTO?

Chapter 2 surveys the history of writing from Egyptian hieroglyphics through the Cypriote syllabary to the Phoenician script, which Powell, following the view of Gelb outlined in Appendix 2, takes as a syllabary. How these earlier forms of writing worked is described in detail in order to make clear the nature and magnitude of the change involved in the invention of the alphabet. Then for the first time in the history of writing it became possible for a man both to record and to pronounce words in a language he did not know. Furthermore, unlike the syllabaries, the alphabet with its unique emphasis on phonetics constituted the perfect vehicle for the recording of hexameter verse. Was that why it was invented?

Chapter 3 presents 68 of the earliest Greek inscriptions, showing both the preponderance of hexametric verse in those long enough to exhibit it and the private, almost literary concerns of the writers which are manifested in all parts of Greece. The absence of public or economic texts confirms the impression of an aristocratic society (of which the adapter was a leading light) intent on its own good life. Noted also is the extent to which the inscriptions' preservation has resulted from nothing more than the imperishability of the objects on which they were written, suggesting the possibility of much contemporary writing on perishable materials. But once such lost writing is mooted, is the absence of public or economic texts significant?

Chapter 4 is concerned with the question whether the adapter invented the alphabet in order to record hexametric verse in general or that of Homer (rather than that of the demonstrably later Hesiod) in particular. The answer comes with a detailed survey of the evidence of Homer's date (from archaeology, linguistics, and outside references both literary and pictorial). Considerable importance is given to the beginning of the representation of legendary material about 725 B.C. with the vastly greater number of such mythic scenes being from the Epic Cycle rather than from Homer. The impetus is taken to be the greater ease of writing and so the greater spread of copies of such shorter poems, as if pot painters and other artists could be inspired only by the written word. And yet the poems of Homer are here assumed to have been recorded some fifty years earlier without having started any new fashion in artistic representation.

Chapter 5 contrasts the Iliad and Odyssey with the short, one-topic songs sung by the bards in the Odyssey at banquets or on the athletic field, by audience request or on their own impulse. The length of the Iliad and Odyssey, which is taken to be inordinate for any conceivable performance, and their richness and variety of episode could have been achieved only in a situation in which the poet was obliged to spin out, to elaborate, to digress -- that is, in which his normal pace was so slowed down that the adapter could record it word by word in the alphabet he had invented for this purpose. &quot;We praise Homer, but the Iliad and the Odyssey were a joint venture, a cooperative effort between the poet and the man who wrote down the poet's words&quot; (p. 230). How are we to react? Many who think wishfully that we have Homer's words pure and unadulterated will be pleased at the neatness of this solution even though they may have to give up notions of the poet's unique genius. Still there are questions. Instead of the epics' organic unity that we have supposed resulted from an orally composing poet's repeated re-creation and structural tightening, are we instead to imagine a poet who has time enough on his hands between words and lines to invent new epithets but rather saves it up to insert episodes which were hitherto separate songs? And if the oral performance of the Iliad requires 18 hours (p. 229, note 19), how many days of how many sessions would it have taken to record in a new and unfamiliar medium the same Iliad now to be viewed as a composition which was conceived ab ovis, vastly enlarged and strung together by a poet who was inflating now for the first time one old song with other songs old and new? And if the Iliad and Odyssey came into being thus, what was it about Homer's earlier repertory that so impressed the adapter that he invented the alphabet to record it?

A final tying-up of mythic and alphabetic loose-ends introduces the adapter by name, that is, as the Palamedes who is in later literature credited with alphabetic and other cultural innovations. All in all, this is a book which is as remarkable for the ingenuity of its answers to difficult questions as it is for its useful review and compelling display of so much of the relevant evidence.

Writing in the ancient Near East

From the end of the third millenium BCE, the art of writing was practiced in the ancient Near East. Here, the pictographic, cuneiform, and hieroglyphic scripts were invented and developed. In particular, Canaan, situated on the cultural crossroads between Egypt and Mesopotamia and beneficiary of their scribal traditions, produced new indigenous writing systems. Some, like the Bublian pseudo-hieroglyphics, the enigmatic Balua stele, or the inscribed bricks from Dier Alla, ancient Succoth, were limited to specific centers. These short-lived systems indicate a high degree of scribal experimentation and originality. 

It is no wonder then that the Canaanites invented the alphabet. They discovered that their language contained some 30 phonemes and that each one could by represented by an individual sign. Like many revolutionary discoveries, its implications were not immediately appreciated and the social effects of the linear alphabet were not to be felt for several generations.

Between the 17th and 12th centuries BCE, the primitive, pictographic alphabet was employed in Shehem, Gezer, Tel al-Hasi, Tel al-Ajul, Bet Mirsim, and Lahish. These inscriptions are generally called Proto-Canaanite. Another large group, the so-called Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions (1500 BCE) were probably written by a colony of northwest Semitic slaves who worked in the mines in Wadi Ma'ara in the Sinai Peninsula. It seems that this script generally served a religious function and may have been developed by the Canaanite priesthood. Certainly, all official government documents were written in cuneiform (e.g. the Tel el-Amarna letters) which obscured the alphabet script.

* http://www.jhom.com/topics/envy/letters/images/ancient_ill_large.jpg

It was during this period that a novel attempt to employ the alphabet was initiated at Ugarit (1370-1200 BCE). Perhaps as a result of the desire to express the local literature in its own medium, a cuneiform alphabet, influenced by the dominant Mesopotamian system, was devised. A similar trend may be noted in other Canaanite cities as well (Bet Shemesh, Taanah, Mt. Tabor). This script as well as an earlier attempt to adapt the cuneiform signs to surfaces other than clay by giving them linear form did not survive the disappearance of the Babylonian scribal centers in Canaan and Syria toward the end of the Bronze Age.

The political and cultural break with Mesopotamia, as well as the administrative needs of emerging young societies, accelerated the development of the linear alphabet. The letters were simplified, beginning the process that was to evolve into a cursive form. The first alphabetic system to emerge was the 22-letter Phoenician script, which appeared by about 1100 BCE, and was to be adopted by the Israelites, Arameans, and later by the Greeks. The new medium was adopted early in Israel's history and deeply affected its civilization; monotheism was grasped now in terms of a written covenant between God and Israel. The central cult was the Decalogue cut in stone, and later became the written Torah scroll. Israelite religion thus elevated writing from a means of recording the mundane to a medium of revelation. 

Perhaps it was because of the relative simplicity of the alphabet or the fact that Israel had no conservative scribal class with vested interests, that biblical society as a whole became &quot;book-centered.&quot; Any tribesman, even a non-priest, could emerge as a literate leader (Joshua 8:32-35; 24-26). The establishment of the monarchy and the process of urbanization resulted in a greater diffusion of writing (among members of the government service, army personnel, the mercantile class, stonemasons, ivory cutters, potters and others).

Certainly by Hezekiah's time, in the eighth century BCE, a great deal of literary activity was going on. Older written traditions were collected and edited (Proverbs 25:1). The classical prophets, or their disciples, wrote down their messages. Prophesies were illustrated by written texts, which could only have meaning for a literate populace. [*] Also the wide use of inscribed personal seals bearing fewer designs and iconographic motifs again argues for a growing literate social body during the First Temple period.

WHO WERE THE PHOENICIANS? 

* http://www.historyforkids.org/greekciv/others/phoenicians/page2.htm

    There have been many different ideas and myths surrounding the origin of the word &quot;Phoenicians&quot;.  The word itself is from the word &quot;Phoinix&quot; which is thought to mean the king of Tyre, the main city of the Phoenicians.  The suggested meanings include &quot;hero of country&quot;, &quot;father of Phoenicians&quot; and &quot;brother of Europa&quot;.  Phoenicia is also associated with the colors dark red and purple.  These colors are associated with Phoenicia because they were the first people to discover how to dye garments using a shellfish called a musket.  The color that would be achieved would be a dark red or purple.  This started an advantage for the Phoenician people because royalty in the surrounding countries decided that only royalty should only wear this new, very expensive, color of clothing.  So, the Phoenicians sold them these garments at a high price, making themselves a whole lot of money!  At this point the Phoenicians were a strong and independent culture because of their awsome location right on the coast for seafaring trade.  Also, their land was unlike Greece.  The Phoenician land was lush and fertile so it made it easier for them to grow food.  What the Phoenicians are really known for is their outstanding abilities as sailors and navigators.  Experts say that the Phoenicians invented the art of navigation.  Though the Phoenician captains could navigate well during the day, they also had expert knowledge of how to use the stars to help them guide them though their nights out at sea. 
  
WHY DID THE PHOENICIANS HEAD WESTWARD? 

There were three different events that started the relocating of Phoenician territory: the Israelite conquest of Canaan to their south, the military occupation of the coast of Palestine, and the location of the Aramaeans in the northern and northeastern territory of Canaan.  Because of these events, Phoenicia shrank from 500 square km to 200 square km.  Due to the loss of land, by around 800 BC (in Greece, the Archaic period) the Phoenicians' only option was to head west!  However,  many experts still argue the specific reason why the Phoenicians went west.  Over time they did come up with some reasons that the Phoenicians went west.  They say it is because of the combination of environment, overpopulation, specialized industries, trade in metals and the silver standard, and relations with their powerful neighbors, Persia and Egypt.  All of these reasons made it impossible for the Phoenicians to exist in such a small area. 

(For similar Greek colonization click here)
  
WHO REALLY INVENTED THE ALPHABET? 

    The idea that the Phoenicians invented the alphabet is one myth that has been proven wrong by the experts.  They now say that it was the Syrians (of Palestine), whom today we prefer to call Canaanites, not the Phoenicians.  It all started when Ugarit, a Syrian town, sought to create a graphic system to represent its language.  This new language was meant to replace the hieroglyphics (pictures and symbols on rocks) and syllabic writings.  After the Syrians created this language, the Phoenicians made some changes to the signs.  For example, they replaced the ox's head, the human head and the fish with more schematic ones.  The Phoenician alphabet only had 22 signs, because the Phoenician language had fewer consonants than the earlier languages, and because vowels were not written (as in modern Hebrew and Arabic).  After 1000 B.C. the Phoenician writing spread in all directions.  The Phoenicians carried it with them on their seafaring excursions along the Mediterranean coast.  The most important writing that came from Phoenician culture was the Greek alphabet, which has become the first of all western alphabets.  Like the one you know today!  So...all in all, the Greeks took over from the Phoenicians the forms and names of signs in the alphabet, and the direction of writing. 
 
WHY DO WE STILL NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS CULTURE? 

    There are many reasons why the Phoenician civiization continues to be a mystery to us all.  In order to reconstruct the history of the Phoenician cities experts relied on three written sources: the Assyrian annals, Biblical texts, and the references passed down from classical authors of this time period.  In Egypt there have been countless carvings and tablets found that give examples of Phoenician ships and cities.  And it is mostly from these carvings that we know for sure that the Phoenician society existed.  Up until recently, archeologists have not been able to find much evidence of the society because the climate caused many of the tablets to disintegrate due to the damp soil.  Also, because so many battles had been fought in Phoenicia, it caused much destruction and many things were lost.  Not to mention, the cities that were rebuilt after these battles caused whatever remains that were left to be built on top of.  Today many archeologists are working in Phoenicia (modern day Lebanon) to dig up any remains that may still be intact.  Experts believe that there are remains in the city of Beirut and are starting work there.  Hopefully over time there will be more discoveries that will add pieces to the puzzle of the Phoenician culture that exists today.</text>

In The Beginning Prior to the alphabet in Greece, in the Bronze Age, the majority of ideas, stories, concepts, and lessons were passed orally.  The men would pass their wisdom to the boys, and the women would pass theirs to the girls.  Most of what was discussed among the people was related to the work and what was required to keep the society functioning.  Society was divided into four major areas: the slaves, the women, the ordinary men, and the aristocrats.  The slaves, women, and most men did not have a lot of use for reading and writing.   The women were tending to things at home, and watching the children, and were not allowed to participate in the function of government.  The majority of men who were not aristocrats or slaves, were farmers, and did not have time or need to read and write because they needed to bring in the crops and tend to the animals.  During this time, life flowed without much need for writing. 

Before the alphabet came to be known to the Greeks, a similar form of symbols was used in about the 13th century BC. This form, called Linear B, is not related to later forms of Greek.  Linear B was used by palace administration prior to anyone else needing to write or read.  When the palace administration disappeared, so did the need for Linear B.   Linear B was found in the form of clay tablets on the Mycenaean mainland in  Greece.   They have been found often burned, dating from around the 13th century.  None of the symbols found relate to the alphabet finds of 500 years later.

Study Notes for Final Examination 
JAL 328 H1S 
Writing Systems 
1. The exam will have four kinds of questions: 
a. True false 
b. Multiple choice 
c. Completion 
d. Short essay 
The first two types will be answered on a special scantron sheet. 
Please bring a soft pencil. 
The last two types of questions will be answered on the examination paper.
The completion questions are quite short, usually just a word or two. The shortessay questions are half a page in length each. 
2. The examination will cover the entire course, including all material in the 
textbook and in the lectures. There will be a slight emphasis on material 
coverered since Quiz II. 
3. You will be asked to identify examples of Roman type by general category. 
For example, if you were asked to identify the category of type used in this 
sheet, you would be expected to identify this as ‘Old Style’. Other categories 
of type would be Humanist, Modern, Transitional, San Serif, Display. The 
type faces used will not necessarily be the same as the examples in the book. 
4. You will be expected to recognise the following symbols from Devanagari:
&lt;p ph b bh m t d n k .&gt; and the diacritic vowels &lt;a a¤ e i u u¤&gt;. You will not 
be expected to recognise ligatures of these symbols. 
5. You will be expected to recognise the following symbols from the Creewriting system: &lt;p t k m n s&gt; for the vowels &lt;e i a&gt;. 
6. You should review the study notes for the mid-term test and for the twoquizzes. 
7. Review the terms at the ends of the chapters. 
8. You should review the basic structural principles of all the writing systemswe have covered. 

9. You should be familiar with the general typological categories of writing
systems, based on how they relate to the language they represent.
This point and the preceding one are particularly important.
10. For Chapter 11, you should be familiar with the general structure ofDevanagari, the general history of writing in South and South-east Asia, andthe role of Indus Valley writing. Don’t forget Tibetan, Mongolian, and 
Manchu. 
11. In Chapter 12, you should know generally how the system works. You will 
not be responsible for the details of the Maya calendar. 
12. In Chapter 13, you should know the general structure and history of thevarious individual writing systems. What is distinctive about each? 
13. In Chapter 14, you should know the general history of calligraphy andprinting. You will not be asked to recognise specific calligraphic styles;
however, see #3 above. Printing has a certain amount of technicalterminology that you should be familiar with. 
14. Chapter 15 gives an overview of the typology of writing systems from anhistorical perspective. Focus on the the revised classification of Figure 15.5,
and do not worry about the earlier proposals in detail, although you willprobably have to work through them to understand the revised proposal.
Sections 15.4 and 15.5 should not be skipped.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi all, I've got a 1992 copy of the CRC ''Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'' from when I was in High School/College.  Included in the data there is a section on USDA nutirent value of foods (which is now at least 12 years out of date, but that shouldn't change much, right?), and I've added some of the info available to the [[Cookbook:Honey]] module.  What I'd like to know is would it be worth it for me to add this type of data (and more that didn't get into the honey module, like fat content, as honey has none) to the various ingredient pages.  If there's support, I'll start adding it to modules that already exist. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 11:30, 24 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: FYI, the USDA has a [http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ nutritional information search] available on their website, and you can also download the data to import into your own relational database.

: If you did want to add nutritional information, it would probably be easier to copy and paste rather than type it in.  But that would still be a fair bit of work, so I'm not sure whether it's worth it or not.

: I'll add the nutritional database link to the [[Cookbook:Nutrition|Nutrition]] page. -- [[User:Loum|loum]] 00:24, 24 May 2004 (UTC)


When refering to items in plural, is it better to have [[Cookbook:Cereal|Cereal]]s or [[Cookbook:Cereal|Cereals]]. I personally prefer the latter. --[[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 04:57, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)

What is the justification for lifting the Legumes category out of Vegetables (although it is still on that page too at the moment) and placing it on the [[Cookbook:Basic_foodstuffs|Basic_foodstuffs]] page? I'm not sure I agree with this move. --[[User:Liblamb|liblamb]]

Arachnids are the largest and most well known class of the Chelicerata with around 65,000 described species. Members of Arachnida can be found on every continent. There are 11 subgroups that most authorities recognize, but the level of classification and some names are not always agrees upon.

==Key to the Orders of Arachnida==
*[[#1|1]]: Opisthosoma clearly segmented, spinnerets absent
*[[#2|2]]: Opisthosoma not segmented or if segmented, spinnerets present on ventral posterior side

==1==
*[[#3|3]]: Opisthosoma has a tail-like elongation, either thick with a sting or thin and whiplike; Usually tropical.
*[[#6|6]]: Opisthosoma lacking tail-like elongatio, or only with a very short appendage.

==3==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Scorpiones|Scorpiones]]: Opisthosoma ending in a sting; First pair of legs not greatly elongated.
*[[#4|4]]: Opisthosoma not ending in a sting; First pair of legs longer than other pairs.

==4==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Palpigradi|Palpigradi]]: Pedipalps similar in size to legs; Less than 5 millimeters in length.
*[[#5|5]]: Pedipalps usually much stouter than legs; Usually larger than 5 millimeters in length.

==5==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Uropygi|Uropygi]]: Eyes present; Tail long and with many segments; Body blackish and at least 50 millimeters in length.
*[[Dichotomous Key/Schizomida|Schizomida]]: Eyes absent; Tail short with one to four segments; Body brownish to yellowish and less than 8 millimeters in length.

==6==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Pseudoscorpiones|Pseudoscorpiones]]: Pedipalps pincerlike; Body more or less oval and flattened; Usually less than 5 millimeters in length.
*[[#7|7]]: Pedipalps leglike or different, but not pincerlike.

==7==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Solifugae|Solifugae]]: Chelicerae very large and extending forward; Body yellow to brownish and 20 to 30 millimeters in length.
*[[#8|8]]: With different combination of characters.

==8==
*[[#9|9]]: First pair of legs and tarsi very long; Opisthosoma constricted at the base; Mostly tropical.
*[[#10|10]]: First pair of legs similar to others; Opisthosoma not obviously constricted at the base.

==9==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Schizomida|Schizomida]]: Prosoma longer than wide; Opisthosoma with a minute terminal appendage; 5 to 8 millimeters in length.
*[[Dichotomous Key/Amblypygi|Amblypygi]]: Prosoma wider than long; Opisthosoma without a minute terminal appendage; Body length variable.

==10==
*[[Dichotomous Key/Ricinulei|Ricinulei]]: Broad flap at anterior end of prosoma concealing chelicerae; Legs not unusually long; Somewhat mite-like or tick-like.
*[[Dichotomous Key/Opiliones|Opiliones]]: Broad flap covering chelicerae absent; Legs often very long and slender.

==The axioms==

*Extensionality, two sets with the same elements are equal.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y,z \ (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow (x=y)&lt;/math&gt;
*Separation, subsets exist
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y_1,p \ \exists y_2 \  \forall x\  x\in y_2 \Leftrightarrow 
(p \wedge x\in y_1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; where ''p'' is any proposition
*The empty set exists 
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \ \forall y\  y\not\in x&lt;/math&gt;
*Union, the union of all members of a set is a set.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\  \exists  y\  \forall z \ z\in y \Leftrightarrow (\exists u \ z\in u \wedge u\in x)&lt;/math&gt;
*Power sets exist
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \ \exists y \ \forall z \ z\in y \Leftrightarrow  
(\forall t \ t \in z \Rightarrow t \in x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;we denote this set ''y'' by P(x)
*Infinity, an infinite set exists
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \ (\empty \in x) \wedge ( \forall y \ y\in x \Rightarrow P(y)\in x)&lt;/math&gt;
*Foundation, no set is a member of itself
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \ x \ne \empty \Rightarrow (\exists y \in x \ y \cap x = \empty)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Cuisine pages''' are primarily intended to be descriptions of various national and ethnic cuisines, grouped by region of origin.

While many of the cuisine pages may contain a list of recipes names associated with that cuisine, these lists are intended to be manually curated by contributors and do not usually contain a comprehensive list of all recipes in the Cookbook related to that particular cuisine.  For a complete, automatically generated, list of recipes which have been categorized, on their individual pages, as being a recipe from a particular area see [[:Category:Recipes by origin|Recipes by origin]].

For a complete, automatically generated,  alphabetical list of pages which have been categorized, on their individual pages, as being a subcategory of the main Cuisines page see [[:Category:Cuisines|Cuisines]].

'''South American cuisines''' are partly based on the cuisines of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Portugal|Portugal]], with heavy influence from the cuisine of various pre-[[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] indigenous peoples. In Brazil, Western African influences are tremendously popular, especially near the coast.

== The Korean War ==

&lt;i&gt;use more specific dates wherever possible&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;add information about korea becoming communist, kim il sung, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After World War II, the US attempted to curb Soviet influence on the Korean Peninsula by occupying southern part of that area. The area occupied by the US became South Korea, while the other part became North Korea. North Korea soon passed into the control of the Communist Party.

In May, 1949, fighting between North and South Korean troops broke out near the border between the two nations. In an attempt to add South Korea to the Communist World, North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union lent their support to North Korea, while the United States did the same to South Korea.

When the United Nations Security Council voted to aid South Korea in stopping North Korean aggression, the United States agreed to send troops to the Korean Peninsula. General Douglas MacArthur was given the command of American troops in Korea.

By the autumn of 1950, North Korean troops were forced out of South Korea. In October, General MacArthur ordered troops to cross into North Korea. In the third week of that month, the US took the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang. 

&lt;i&gt;flesh this paragraph out&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then, the People's Republic of China began its counterattacks at the end of November. In December, Chinese &quot;volunteers&quot; took over Pyongyang and ejected enemy troops from North Korea. 

&lt;i&gt;add backlash against truman for firing macarthur, macarthur's grand homecoming and retirement speech (old soldiers never die)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The US intended to do whatever it took to win the Korean War. It even planned on using the atomic bomb. However, President Truman did not trust General MacArthur to follow orders when using the atomic bomb. Therefore, he asked for MacArthur's resignation; MacArthur complied. 

After months of deadlock, peace was finally agreed to in July, 1953. The United Nations signed an armistice with North Korea and the People's Republic of China. South Korea, however, refused to sign. The two Koreas are still technically at war because no Peace Treaty was ever agreed to by both sides.</text>

Thanks for the compliment on my user page, and [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]].  If you have any questions, either ask at the [[Wikibooks:staff lounge|staff lounge]], or feel free to ask me on my [[User talk:Gentgeen|talk page]].

Have fun editing.  [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:26, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)


I really like the guide you started. Anyway I thought you might want to know that the Wikipedia article for America's Army is incredibly bad and is mostly just a few people spreading their political bias and has almost nothing to do with the actual game. I'm just letting you know because I see that you know America's Army quite well and might be able to help out on that article too.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Phantom. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Phantom~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <comment>/* Setting up OpenSSH with public key cryptography */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:SSH|SSH]] is a secure replacement for [[w:Telnet|Telnet]] and [[w:Remote Shell|rsh]]. All communications between the client and server are encrypted. To access an SSH client (usually [[OpenSSH]]) in most Unix OSs, type &lt;code&gt;ssh user@host.com&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal window. If you don't specify the username, the user that entered the command (&lt;code&gt;$USER&lt;/code&gt;) will be used. In Windows, you will need to download a 3rd-party utility such as [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty PuTTY] or Cygwin. Find more information in the ssh(1) man page. On other Operating Systems (smart phones for example, you will have to use a [http://webssh.uni.me/ webbased client])
There are several SSH apps for Android, including ConnectBot, Dropbear, ServerAssistant, and the Telnet / SSH Simple Client.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20111022065038482/AndroidSSHTools.html &quot;Top Free Android SSH Tools&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
SSH is actually so much more than just a way to access a remote shell securely. It can be used for lots of other ways to transfer information securely. It includes a neat utility &quot;scp&quot;, which stands for secure copy, which is a great way to copy files between machines. It works almost exactly like the default unix &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; command. &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; also allows you to copy a file from a remote host to a remote host. An example of &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;code&gt;scp user@host.com:~/files/ .&lt;/code&gt; which means copy files from &lt;code&gt;files/&lt;/code&gt; directory in user's home directory on the host.com machine (it will copy ALL files from the files/ directory) to the CWD (current working directory).

Another great use is to use it to encrypt the transport of any data from one machine to another. As an extreme example, you can use SSH to remotely move a disk from one machine to another (akin to ghost, but securely). This may not be the best use of SSH, or the fastest way to transfer data from one machine to another over a network, but it shows you how powerful SSH can be.

Another great feature is port forwarding. This allows you 'redirect' communication to and from a local application through SSH to another host. So, with SSH you can secure otherwise insecure communications over an encrypted 'tunnel'.

===Using SSH===
The secure shell client is conveniently called &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;. It is typically used to access a remote host. A typical usage of &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; is

:&lt;code&gt;ssh user@host&lt;/code&gt;

This means that the client intends to login as &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt; machine. On successful authentication, an SSH session is established between the client and the &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt;.

===Using SFTP===
SFTP has ''nothing'' to do with FTP.  SFTP merely works like FTP, meaning you use it as you would FTP.  Using SFTP requires only the SSH server.  The FTP server is irrelevant to SFTP.  Files are transferred as binary by default.
:&lt;code&gt;sftp user@host&lt;/code&gt;

===Using SCP===
&lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt;, aka Secure Copy, works just like &lt;code&gt;rcp&lt;/code&gt;.
*Copy to a remote host - You must use the colon.  REMOTE_PATH is not necessary and all REMOTE_PATHs are relative to the user's home directory.
*:&lt;code&gt;scp FILE_PATH user@host:REMOTE_PATH&lt;/code&gt;
*Copy from a remote host , 
*:&lt;code&gt;scp user@host:REMOTE_PATH LOCAL_PATH&lt;/code&gt;
Note : If your filename contains spaces then, use scp like this:-
* file name is ''/media/sda6/Tutorials/Linux Unix/linux_book.pdf'' then destination directory is ''home/narendra/data''
** &lt;code&gt;$scp ''user''@''host'':&quot;/media/sda6/Tutorials/Linux\\ Unix/linux_book.pdf&quot; /home/narendra/data&lt;/code&gt;
* file name is ''/home/narendra/linux_book.pdf'' then destination directory is ''/media/Tutorials/Linux Unix/''
**$ &lt;code&gt;scp /home/narendra/linux_book.pdf'' user''@''host'':&quot;/media/Tutorials/Linux\\ Unix/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
Note : If you want to copy the whole directory then use
* &lt;code&gt;scp -r user@host:&quot;&lt;source_dirname&gt;&quot; &lt;destination_dirname&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

===Creating SSH Keys===
Although SSH can be used with passwords, doing so is not recommended, and many servers will not allow password logins. Instead, use a key - this is more secure, and more convenient.

To create an SSH key , 

Most modern Unix systems include the OpenSSH client.  To generate a key, run:

 $ ssh-keygen

This will store your private key in &lt;tt&gt;$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/tt&gt;, and your public key in &lt;tt&gt;$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&lt;/tt&gt;.  You can use different filenames, but these are the default filenames, so it's easiest to not change them.

===Permissions===
Because the security of your private key is so important, SSH will not work if file permissions are insecure. SSH will create files and directories with the appropriate permissions, but sometimes things will go wrong. To fix permission issues:

 $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/KEY ~/.ssh/KEY.pub
 $ chmod 700 ~/.ssh

===Establish Trust===
To log into a remote server, you'll need to put the public key on that server's list of authorized keys.

In other words, you need to append a copy of your local &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&lt;code&gt; file to the end of the remote &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; file.

====ssh-copy-id====
The easiest way to do that is using &lt;code&gt;ssh-copy-id&lt;/code&gt;. This requires some alternate form of authentication, usually password (since you haven't got a key on the server you cannot use key authentication yet).

 $ ssh-copy-id user@host.net

====Step-by-step====
The hard way to do that is to manually do each step that the above &lt;code&gt;ssh-copy-id&lt;/code&gt; command does automatically for you:

* First ssh-copy-id creates the remote &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/code&gt; folder on the destination server, if it does not already exist:
: &lt;code&gt; ssh user@host &quot;mkdir ~/.ssh &amp;&amp; chmod 700 ~/.ssh&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

* Next ssh-copy-id uploads your PUBLIC key only (not your private key).
: &lt;code&gt; scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@host:.ssh/KEY.pub&lt;/code&gt;
* Then ssh-copy-id appends your PUBLIC key to the server's list of authorized keys:
: &lt;code&gt; ssh user@host&lt;/code&gt;

: &lt;code&gt; cat ~/.ssh/KEY.pub &gt;&gt;  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt; rm ~/.ssh/KEY.pub&lt;/code&gt;

Advanced *nix users could do all those steps in one line:
: &lt;code&gt;cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@host &quot;cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

All of that is automatically done for you when you run:
 $ ssh-copy-id user@host.net

===SSH Personal Configuration===
You don't need to set up a &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; file, but it makes authentication easier. The important part is to specify your user name and your private key - if this is specified in the config file, you needn't provide it on the command line. Using HostName, you can shorten the ssh command to:
 $ ssh servername

====Example====
&lt;pre&gt;
#Specific configuration applied to one host
#This configuration applies specifically to a host which uses Windows Domain login
Host Short_Name
        HostName some_host.com
        User domain\username
        Protocol 2
        UseRsh no
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/KEY

# Generic configuration that I apply to all hosts, especially on my private LAN
# Of note, the options to forward X11 and the SSH Agent.  X11 forwarding lets you
# tunnel and X session or programs via SSH.
Host *
        User USERNAME
        Protocol 2
        ForwardX11 yes
        ForwardAgent yes
        UseRsh no
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key_37_rsa
        FallBackToRsh no
        # In a pesky lab environment, add the following to your config
        # CheckHostIP no
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can now ssh into &lt;code&gt;some_host.com&lt;/code&gt; with just &lt;code&gt;ssh Short_Name&lt;/code&gt;.

===Using an SSH Agent===
This part assumes that you are not using a ssh client configuration file and that your keys are protected with a passphrase. &lt;!--Why are we plugging keychain? There's no good description of what it actually does that's useful, and if that information exists, it belongs in a keychain tutorial, not an ssh tutorial. This will probably be removed.--&gt; An excellent BASH utility script called [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain/ Keychain] automates and simplifies the tedious use of ssh-agents.  If your host does not have Keychain installed, ask your administrator.  Alternatively you can download and unpack the script into your home directory from the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/keychain/ Keychain] website.

====Using Keychain====
*Start your agent on your local host
:&lt;code&gt;keychain&lt;/code&gt; - honestly you don't need to type this, simply loading your keys causes this to happen

*Access your forwarded agent from a remote host
:&lt;code&gt;keychain --inherit any-once&lt;/code&gt;

*Load your key
:&lt;code&gt;keychain ~/.ssh/KEY&lt;/code&gt;
:This will prompt you for a password (if you gave your key one!).

*Unload your key
:&lt;code&gt;keychain --clear&lt;/code&gt;

*Stop the agent
:&lt;code&gt;keychain --stop&lt;/code&gt;

====BASH configuration Change====
add the following lines to &lt;code&gt;~/.bash_login&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;keychain&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;source ~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh&lt;/code&gt;

==[[w:Public-key cryptography|Public-key cryptography]]==
The most significant difference between SSH and Telnet &amp; rsh is in the realm of security. SSH uses [[w:RSA|RSA]] or [[w:Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] for [[w:Public-key cryptography|public-key cryptography]].

* The server or domain to which you are trying to connect generates 2 keys (public and private) for a client.
* The public key is given to the client the first time it tries to connect. The corresponding private key is a secret and kept with the server.
* The client sends the packets of data by encrypting it through the public key and this data is decrypted by using the corresponding private key stored there.

Communication from the server to the client is also possible in the same way&amp;mdash;the server encrypts using the client's public key and the client decrypts using it's private key.

==Setting up OpenSSH with public key cryptography==
# With your distro's package manager, install sshd (or openssh-server) on the server, and on the client install ssh (or openssh-clients). It is likely that they're already installed since they're probably part of the distro's default installation.
# Make sure the following is there and uncommented (there's no # in front of them) in /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server:
 PubkeyAuthentication yes
 PasswordAuthentication no
# On the client command line, run &lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;rsa&quot; is the default, it is not necessary to explicitly specify &quot;rsa&quot;).
# Copy where you saved your generated keys/id_rsa.pub to portable storage.
# Bring the portable storage to the server and mount it as the user you will be remotely logging in as. Don't log out yet.
# cat portable storage mount point/id_rsa.pub&gt;&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Add either sshd:ALL or sshd:IP of client to /etc/hosts.allowed.
# Open TCP port 22. This varies depending on your firewall. For Fedora Core, RHEL, and derivatives, this can be done with system-config-securitylevel. For other GNU/Linux systems, echo '-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 --syn -j ACCEPT'&gt;&gt;/etc/sysconfig/iptables and restart the iptables service. You may wish to run sshd on a non-standard port.
# If the server's behind a router:
## Stop using DHCP and assign a static IP address to your server. See the Gentoo Handbook for instructions if you do not know how.
## Forward TCP port 22 to your server.
# (Re)start the sshd service.
# Test the setup by running ssh user to login as on the server@IP or domain of the server. Tip: If the username that you are logging in as on the server is the same as the one you're currently using on the client, you don't need to specify the user to log in as on the server.

== SSH as a Proxy ==
If you can make an SSH connection, you can (most likely) use that connection as a SOCKS proxy, without any extra setup on the remote computer. Traffic is tunneled securely through the SSH connection. If you are on an unsecured wireless connection, you can use this to effectively secure all your traffic from snooping. You can also use this to bypass IP restrictions, because you will appear to be connecting from the remote computer. Note that DNS traffic is not tunneled.

Pick some big port number (bigger than 1024 so you can use it as non-root). Here I choose 1080, the standard SOCKS port. Use the &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; option for dynamic port forwarding.
 ssh -D 1080 user@host

That's it. Now as long as the SSH connection is open, your application can use a SOCKS proxy on port 1080 on your own computer (localhost). For example, in Firefox on Linux:
* go to Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Network -&gt; Connection -&gt; Settings...
* check &quot;Manual proxy configuration&quot;
* make sure &quot;Use this proxy server for all protocols&quot; is cleared
* clear &quot;HTTP Proxy&quot;, &quot;SSL Proxy&quot;, &quot;FTP Proxy&quot;, and &quot;Gopher Proxy&quot; fields
* enter &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; for &quot;SOCKS Host&quot;, and &quot;1080&quot; (or whatever port you chose) for Port.

== SSH from your webbrowser ==
You can also use ssh from a webbrowser with javascript support even when you don't have a secure shell client. In order to do this you have to install [[w:Web-based_SSH|AnyTerm, AjaxTerm or WebShell]] on the system where the SSH server is running or use a third party service like [http://webssh.uni.me/ WebSSH].

It's true that neutrons decay into protons and electrons, but that doesn't mean that we can say that they are &quot;made of&quot; these particles. Sometimes a bound proton may decay into a neutron and a positron.[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:03, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[portuguese/Contents/Regular verbs|&lt;&lt; Portuguese:Regular verbs]]'''

Regular verbs have a invariable radical (fal&lt;u&gt;ar&lt;/u&gt; - to speak) and are easy to memorize. Each conjugation follows a different, but regular pattern.

==-ar present tense regular verbs==
All regular verbs ending in -ar are conjugated the same way. The conjugation is dependent on the subject that the verb is in reference to. Here is an example conjugation for the verb falar:

{| style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | I speak
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Eu fal
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (s,inf) speak
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Tu fal
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;as&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | He speaks&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;i&gt;also ela, voc&amp;ecirc;)&lt;/i&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Ele fal
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | We speak
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | N&amp;oacute;s fal&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;amos&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (p) speak
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | V&amp;oacute;s fal&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;ais&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | They speak&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Eles fal
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;am&lt;/b&gt;
|}

==-er present tense regular verbs==

{| style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | I eat
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Eu com
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (s,inf) eat
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Tu com
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;es&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | He eats&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;i&gt;also ela, voc&amp;ecirc;)&lt;/i&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Ele com
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | We eat
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | N&amp;oacute;s com&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;emos&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (p) eat
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | V&amp;oacute;s com&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;eis&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | They eat&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Eles com
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;em&lt;/b&gt;
|}


==-ir present tense regular verbs==
Regular tense verbs ending in -ir are handled very similarly to -er verbs. The only difference is the conjugation for nós and vós. Here is an example conjugation for the verb partir (to leave):

{| style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | I leave
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Eu part
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (s,inf) leave
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Tu part
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;es&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | He leave&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;i&gt;also ela, voc&amp;ecirc;)&lt;/i&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Ele part
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | We leave
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | N&amp;oacute;s part&lt;br&gt;
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;imos&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | You (p) leave
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | V&amp;oacute;s part
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; | They leave&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;
| align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot; | Eles part
| bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; | &lt;b&gt;em&lt;/b&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Llull. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Llull~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

|-

==Introduction==
XUL (pronounced zool and rhymes with cool), which stands for
eXtensible User interface Language, is an XML-based user interface language originally developed for use in the Netscape browser. It is  now maintained by Mozilla. It is a part of Mozilla Firefox and many other Mozilla applications, and is available as part of Gecko, the rendering engine developed by Mozilla. In fact, XUL is powerful enough that the entire user interface in the Firefox application is implemented in XUL.

Like HTML, in XUL you can create an interface using a relatively simple markup language, define the appearance with CSS style sheets, and use JavaScript to manipulate behavior. 
Unlike HTML, however, XUL provides a rich set of user interface 
widgets to create, for example, menus, toolbars and tabbed panels.

To put it in simple terms, XUL can be used to create lightweight, cross-platform, cross-device user interfaces.

Many applications are developed using features of a specific platform that makes building cross-platform software time-consuming and costly. Some users may want to use an application on technologies other than traditional computers, such as small handheld devices. To date, there have been some cross-platform solutions already developed. Java, for example, was created just for such a purpose. However, creating GUIs with Java is cumbersome at best. Alternatively, XUL has been designed for building portable user interfaces easily and quickly. It is available on most versions of Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Unix. Yahoo! currently uses XUL and related 
technologies for its Yahoo! tool bar (a Firefox extension) and Photomail application.

To illustrate XUL’s potential, this chapter will work through a few examples.  Potential is the correct word here.  The full capabilities of XUL are beyond the scope of this chapter but it is designed to give the reader a first look at the power of XUL.  One more thing needs to be noted: you’ll need a Gecko-based browser (such as Firefox or the Mozilla Suite) or [http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner XULRunner] to work with XUL.

=The Basics=

XUL is XML, and like all good XML files, a good XUL file begins with the standard 
XML version declaration.  Currently, XUL is using the XML version 1.0. 

To make your XUL page look good, you must include a ''global'' stylesheet in it.
The URI of the default stylesheet is ''href = &quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot;''. While you can 
load as many stylesheets as you like, it is best practice to load the global stylesheet 
initially. Look at Fig.1.  Notice the reference to “chrome”. ‘The chrome is the part 
of the application window that lies outside of a window's content area. Toolbars, menu 
bars, progress bars, and window title bars are all examples of elements that are 
typically part of the chrome.’(1)  Chrome is the descriptive term used to name all of the 
elements in a XUL application. Think of it like the chrome on the outside of a 
car. It’s what catches your eye.  The elements in a XUL file are what you see 
in the browser window.
 
All XML documents must have a namespace declaration. The developers of 
XUL have provided a namespace that shows where they came up with the name XUL. 
(The reference is from the movie ‘Ghostbusters’ for the uninitiated) 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;
&lt;window
   id=&quot;window identifier&quot;
   title=&quot;XUL page&quot;
   orient=&quot;horizontal&quot;
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;
   . . . (add elements here)
&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The next thing to note is the tag &lt;window&gt;.  This tag is analogous to the
&lt;body&gt; tag in HTML.  All the elements will live inside the window tag.  In 
Fig. 1 the window tag has three attributes that are very important.  The ‘id’ 
attribute is important in that it is the way to identify the window so that 
scripts can refer to it. While the title attribute is not necessary, it is 
good practice to provide a descriptive name.  The value of title will be 
displayed in the title bar of the window.  The next attribute is very 
important.  This tells the browser in what direction to lay out the elements 
described in the XUL file.  Horizontal means just that.  Lay out in succession 
across the window. Vertical is the opposite; it adds the elements in column 
format.  Vertical is the default value so if you do not declare this attribute 
you’ll get vertical orientation.

As was stated earlier, a XUL document is used to create user interfaces.  
UI's are generally full of interactive components such as text boxes, buttons 
and the like.  A XUL document accomplishes this with the use of widgets, which 
are self-contained components with pre-defined behavior.  For example buttons 
will respond to mouse clicks and menu bars can hold buttons. All the normally
accepted actions of GUI components are built in to the widgets. There is 
already a rich library of predefined widgets, but because this is open source, 
any one can define a widget or a set of widgets for themselves. 

The widgets are ‘disconnected’ until they are programmed to work 
together.  This can be done simply with JavaScript or a more complex 
application can be made using something like C++  or Java.  In this chapter we 
will use JavaScript to illustrate XUL’s uses and potential. 

Also, a XUL file should have .xul extension.  The Mozilla browser will 
automatically recognize it and know what to do with it when you click on it.  
Optionally, an .xml extension could be used but you would have to open the 
file within the browser.

One more thing needs to be mentioned.  There are a few syntax rules to 
follow and they are:
*All events and attributes must be written in lowercase.
*All strings must be double quoted.
*Every XUL widget must use close tags (either &lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt; or &lt;tag/&gt;) to be well-formed.
*All attributes must have a value.

=A First Example=

What better way to start then with the good old ‘Hello World’ example.
Open up a text editor (not MS Word) like notepad or TextPad and type in:


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;

&lt;window
id=&quot;Hello&quot;
title=&quot;Hello World Example&quot;
orient=&quot;vertical&quot;
persist=&quot;screenX screenY width height&quot;
xmlns= &quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;

&lt;description style='font-size:24pt'&gt;Hello World&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;description value='Hello World' style='font-size:24pt'/&gt;
&lt;label value = 'Hello World'  style='font-size:24pt'/&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Save it anywhere but be sure to give the file the .xul extension. Now 
just double click on it and it should open in your Mozilla or Netscape 
browser.  You should get ‘Hello World’ three times, one on top of the other.  
Notice the different ways that ‘Hello World’ was printed: twice from a 
description tag and once from a label tag.  Both &lt;description&gt; and &lt;label&gt; are 
text related tags. Using the description tag is the only way to write text 
that is not contents of a ‘value’ attribute. This means that you can write
text that isn't necessarily assigned to a variable. In the second and third examples 
the text is expressed as an attribute to the tag description or label, respectively. You can see here that the 
orient attribute in window is set to ‘vertical’.  That is why the text is 
output in a column. Otherwise, if orient was set to ‘horizontal’, all the text 
would be on one line. Try it.

Now let’s start adding some more interesting elements.

=Adding Widgets=
As stated earlier, XUL has an existing rich library of elements fondly 
called widgets.  These include buttons, text boxes, progress bars, sliders and 
a host of other useful items.  One good listing is the [http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/xulref/ XUL Programmer's Reference].

Let us take a look at some simple buttons. Enter the following code and 
place it into a Notepad or other text editor that is not MS Word.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;

&lt;window
id=&quot;findfile-window&quot;
title=&quot;Find Files&quot;
orient=&quot;horizontal&quot;
xmlns=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;

&lt;button id=&quot;find-button&quot; label=&quot;Find&quot; default=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;button id=&quot;cancel-button&quot; label=&quot;Cancel&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Save it and give the file the .xul extension. Open a Mozilla or Netscape browser 
and open the file from the browser. You should see a &quot;find&quot; button and a &quot;cancel button&quot;.
From here it is possible to add more functionality and build up elaborate interfaces. 

There has to be some place to put all of these things and like the &lt;body&gt; 
tag in HTML, the &lt;box&gt; tag in XUL is used to house the widgets.  In other 
words, boxes are containers that encapsulate other elements. There are a 
number of different &lt;box&gt; types.  In this example we’ll use &lt;hbox&gt;, &lt;vbox&gt;, 
&lt;toolbox&gt; and &lt;tabbox&gt;.  

&lt;hbox&gt; and &lt;vbox&gt; are synonymous with the attributes 'orient = &quot;horizontal&quot;' and 
'orient = &quot;vertical&quot;', which respectively form the &lt;window&gt; tag. By using these two 
boxes, discrete sections of the window can have their own orientation. These 
two elements can hold all of the other elements and can even be nested.  

The tags &lt;toolbox&gt; and &lt;tabbox&gt; serve special purposes.   &lt;toolbox&gt; is 
used to create tool bars at the top or bottom of the window while &lt;tabbox&gt; 
sets up a series of tabbed sheets in the window. 

Take the XUL framework from Fig. 1 and replace &quot;. . .( add elements 
here)&quot;  with a &lt;vbox&gt; tag pair (that's both open and close tags).  This will 
be the outside container for the rest of the elements.  Remember, the &lt;vbox&gt; 
means that elements will be positioned vertically in order of appearance.  Add 
the attribute 'flex=&quot;1&quot;'.  This will make the menu bar extend all the way 
across the window.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;

&lt;window
id=&quot;findfile-window&quot;
title=&quot;Find Files&quot;
orient=&quot;horizontal&quot;
xmlns=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;

&lt;vbox flex=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
    (... add elements here)
&lt;/vbox&gt;

&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The 'flex' attribute needs some explanation since it is a primary way 
of sizing and positioning the elements on a page.  Flex is a dynamic way of 
sizing and positioning widgets in a window.  The higher the flex number (1 
being highest), the more that widget gets priority sizing and placement over 
widgets with lower flex settings.  All elements have size attributes, such as 
width and/or height, that can be set to an exact number of pixels but using 
flex insures the same relative sizing and positioning when resizing a window 
occurs.

Now put a pair each of &lt;toolbox&gt; and &lt;tabbox&gt; tags inside of the 
&lt;vbox&gt; tags with &lt;toolbox&gt; first.  As was said &lt;toolbox&gt; is used to create 
tool bars so lets add a toolbar similar to the one at the top of the browser.

This is the code so far:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;

&lt;window
id=&quot;findfile-window&quot;
title=&quot;Find Files&quot;
orient=&quot;horizontal&quot;
xmlns=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;

&lt;vbox flex=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;toolbox&gt;

&lt;menubar id=&quot;MenuBar&quot;&gt;
&lt;menu id=&quot;File&quot; label=&quot;File&quot; accesskey=&quot;f&quot;&gt;
&lt;menupopup id=&quot;FileMenu&quot;&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;New&quot; accesskey=&quot;n&quot;/&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Open...&quot; accesskey=&quot;o&quot;/&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Save&quot; accesskey=&quot;s&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Save As...&quot; accesskey=&quot;s&quot;/&gt;  
&lt;menuitem label=&quot; ... &quot;/&gt; 
&lt;menuseparator/&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Close&quot; accesskey=&quot;c&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/menupopup&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;

&lt;menu id=&quot;Edit&quot; label=&quot;Edit&quot; accesskey=&quot;e&quot;&gt;
&lt;menupopup id=&quot;EditMenu&quot;&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Cut&quot; accesskey=&quot;t&quot; acceltext=&quot;Ctrl + X&quot;/&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Copy&quot; accesskey=&quot;c&quot;  acceltext=&quot;Ctrl + C&quot;/&gt;
&lt;menuitem label=&quot;Paste&quot; accesskey=&quot;p&quot; disabled=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/menupopup&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;

&lt;menu id=&quot;View&quot; label=&quot;View&quot; accesskey=&quot;v&quot;&gt;
&lt;menupopup id=&quot;ViewMenu&quot;&gt;
&lt;menuitem id=&quot;Tool Bar1&quot; label=&quot;Tool Bar1&quot;
type=&quot;checkbox&quot; accesskey=&quot;1&quot; checked=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;menuitem id=&quot;Tool Bar2&quot; label=&quot;Tool Bar2&quot;
type=&quot;checkbox&quot; accesskey=&quot;2&quot; checked=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/menupopup&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;
&lt;/menubar&gt;

&lt;/toolbox&gt;

&lt;tabbox&gt;

&lt;/tabbox&gt;

&lt;/vbox&gt;

&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


There should now be a menu bar with “File   Edit   View” in it and they 
should each expand when you click on them.  Let’s examine the elements and 
their attributes more closely to see how they work.  

First the &lt;menubar&gt; holds all of the menu items (File, Edit ,View). 
Next there are the three different menu items. Each menu has a set of elements 
and attributes.  The &lt;menupopup&gt; does just it says.  It creates the popup menu 
that occurs when the menu label is clicked. In the popup menu is the list of 
menu items. Each of these has an 'accesskey' attribute.  This attribute 
underlines the letter and provides the reference for making a hot key for that 
menu item.  Notice in the Edit menu, both 'Cut' and 'Copy' have accelerator 
text labels.  In the File menu there is a &lt;menuseperator/&gt; tag.  This places a 
line across the menu that acts as a visual separator.  In the Edit menu, 
notice the menu item labeled 'Paste' has an attribute: disabled=&quot;true&quot;.  This 
causes the Paste label to be grayed out in that menu and finally in the View 
menu the menu items there are actually checkboxes.  The first one is checked 
by default and the second one is not. 

Now on to the &lt;tabbox&gt;.  Let's make three different sheets with 
different elements on them.  Put this code in between the &lt;tabbox&gt; tags:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;tabbox flex=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tabs&gt;
   &lt;tab id=&quot;Tab1&quot; label=&quot;Sheet1&quot; selected=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;tab id=&quot;Tab2&quot; label=&quot;Sheet2&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;tab id=&quot;Tab3&quot; label=&quot;Sheet3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/tabs&gt;

&lt;tabpanels flex=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tabpanel flex=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;Tab1Sheet&quot; orient=&quot;vertical&quot; &gt;
   &lt;description style=&quot;color:teal;&quot;&gt;
      This doesn't do much.
      Just shows some of the style attributes.
   &lt;/description&gt;
   &lt;/tabpanel&gt;

   &lt;tabpanel flex=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;Tab2Sheet&quot; orient=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
   &lt;description class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;
      Hey, the slider works (for free).
   &lt;/description&gt;
   &lt;scrollbar/&gt;
   &lt;/tabpanel&gt;

   &lt;tabpanel flex=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;Tab3Sheet&quot; orient=&quot;vertical&quot;&gt;
   &lt;hbox&gt;
      &lt;text value=&quot;Progress Meter&quot; id=&quot;txt&quot; style=&quot;display:visible;&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;progressmeter id=&quot;prgmeter&quot; mode=&quot;undetermined&quot;
         style=&quot;display:visible;&quot; label=&quot;Progress Bar&quot;/&gt;		  
   &lt;/hbox&gt;
   &lt;description value=&quot;Wow, XUL! I mean cool!&quot;/&gt;   
   &lt;/tabpanel&gt;
&lt;/tabpanels&gt;
&lt;/tabbox&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


The tabs '''are first defined''' with &lt;tab&gt;. They are given an id and 
label.  Next, a set of associated panels is created, each with different 
content.  The first one is to show that like HTML style sheets can be applied 
in line.  The second two sheets have component type elements in them.  See how 
the slider works and the progress bar is running on its own. 

XUL has a number of types of elements for creating list boxes. A list box displays items in the form of a list. Any item in such a particular list can be selected. XUL provides two types of elements to create lists, a listbox element to create multi-row list boxes, and a menulist element to create drop-down list boxes, as we have already seen. 

The simplest list box uses the listbox element for the box itself, and the listitem element for each item. For example, this list box will have four rows, one for each item. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;listbox&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Butter Pecan&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Chocolate Chip&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Raspberry Ripple&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Squash Swirl&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/listbox&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Like with the HTML option element, you a value can be assinged using the value attribute. The list box will set to a normal size, but you can alter the size to a certain level using the row attributes. Set it to the number of rows to display in the list box. A scroll bar will automatically come up to let the user be able to see the rest of the items in the list box if the box is too small.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;listbox rows=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Butter Pecan&quot; value=&quot;bpecan&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Chocolate Chip&quot; value=&quot;chocchip&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Raspberry Ripple&quot; value=&quot;raspripple&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;listitem label=&quot;Squash Swirl&quot; value=&quot;squash&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/listbox&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Assigning values to each of the listitems lets the user be able to reference them later using script. This way, other elements can be  reference this items to be used for alternative purposes.

All these elements are very nice and easy to put into a window, but by themselves they 
don't do anything.  Now we have to connect things with some other code.

=Adding Event Handlers and Responding to Events=
To make things really useful, some type of scripting or application 
level coding has to be done. In our example, JavaScript will be used to add 
functionality to the components.  This is done in a similar fashion as to 
scripting with HTML.  With HTML, an event handler is associated with an 
element and some action is initiated when that handler is activated.  Most of 
the handlers used with HTML are also found in XUL, in addition to some unique 
ones.  Scripting can be done in additional lines of code, but a more efficient way is to create a 
separate file with the needed scripts inside of it.  This allows the page to 
load faster since the rendering engine doesn’t have to decide what to do with 
the embedded script tags.  

That being said, we’ll first add a simple script, in line, as a first 
example.

Let’s add an ‘onclick’ event handler to fire an alert box when an element 
is selected.  Inside the &lt;window&gt; tag add the line beginning with onclick:


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;window
   onclick=&quot;alert(event.target.tagName); return false;&quot;
   id=&quot;findfile-window&quot;
   title=&quot;Find Files&quot;
   orient=&quot;horizontal&quot;
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&quot;&gt;
       (... add elements here)
&lt;/window&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Now when you click on any element in the window, you created an alert box that 
pops up telling you the name of the element.  One interesting thing to note:  
When you click on the text enclosed by the description tag the response is 
undefined but when you click on the text wrapped by the label tag you get the 
tabName label. 

This implies that a description tag is not really an element.
After playing with the alert box, delete that line and add this inside the 
opening tag of the ‘Close’ menu item in the ‘File’ menu:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
oncommand=&quot;window.close()&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Now when you click on ‘Close’ or use the ‘C’ as a hot key, the entire 
window will close.  The oncommand event handler is actually preferred over 
onclick because oncommand can handle hot keys and other non-mouse events.  

Let’s try one more thing.  Add this right after the opening &lt;window&gt; tag. 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function show()
{
  var meter=document.getElementById('prgmeter');
  meter.setAttribute(&quot;style&quot;,&quot;display: visible;&quot;);
  var tx=document.getElementById('txt');
  tx.setAttribute(&quot;style&quot;,&quot;display: visible;&quot;);
}

function hide()
{
  var meter=document.getElementById('prgmeter');
  meter.setAttribute(&quot;style&quot;,&quot;display: none;&quot;);
  var tx=document.getElementById('txt');
  tx.setAttribute(&quot;style&quot;,&quot;display: none;&quot;);
}

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


These two functions first retrieve a reference to the progress meter and 
the text element using their ids. Then both functions set the style attributes 
of the progress meter and text element to have a display of 'visible' 
or ‘none’ which will do just that: hide or display those two elements. (The tabpanel for the 
progress meter has to be displayed in order to see these actions)

Now add two buttons that will provide the event to fire these two methods. 
First, add a new box element to hold the buttons.  The width 
attribute of the box needs to be set otherwise the buttons will be laid out to 
extend the length of the window.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;box width=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;button id=&quot;show&quot; label=&quot;Show&quot; default=&quot;true&quot; oncommand=&quot;show();&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;button id=&quot;hide&quot; label=&quot;Hide&quot; default=&quot;true&quot; oncommand=&quot;hide();&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/box&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


==Style Sheets==
Style sheets may be used both for creating themes, as well as modifying elements for a more elaborate user interfaces. XUL uses CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for this.  A style sheet is a file which contains style information for elements. The style sheet makes it possible to apply certain fonts, colors, borders, and size to the elements of your choice. Mozilla applies a default style sheet to each XUL window. So far, this is the style sheet that has been used for all the XUL documents:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


That line gives the XUL document the default chrome://global/skin/ style sheet. In Mozilla, this will be translated as the file global.css, which contains default style information for XUL elements. The file will still show is this line is left out but it will not be as aesthetically pleasing. The style sheet applies theme-specific fonts, colors and borders to make the elements look more suitable. Even though style sheets can provide a better looking file, adding styles cannot always provide a better view. Some CSS properties do not affect the appearance of a widget, such as those that change the size or margins. In XUL, the use of the &quot;flex: attribute should be used instead of using specific sizes. There are other ways that CSS does not apply, and may be to advanced for this tutorial.

Using a style sheet that you perhaps have already made, you just have to insert one extra line of code
pointing to the CSS file you have already made.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;chrome://global/skin/&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;findfile.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


This second line of code references the style sheet, and will take over as the default style sheet used for the XUL document.  Sometimes it is desired not to have the style that comes with the default CSS file.

=Conclusion= 
The examples shown in this chapter merely scratch the surface of XUL’s 
capabilities. Even though these examples are very simple, one can see how easy 
it would be to create more complex UI’s with XUL.  With a complete set of the 
standard components such as buttons and text boxes at the programmer’s 
disposal, the programmer can code anything in XUL that can be coded in HTML.  
The cross-platform ability of XUL is another bonus but the fact that it 
doesn’t work with Microsoft’s Internet Explorer may suppress XUL’s widespread 
use. There is some hope that due to the delay in the development of the next 
version of IE that XUL may find it’s way into IE, but don’t hold your breath..

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The word '''arpeggio''' (ar-''peh''-jee-oh) is Italian for &quot;like a harp&quot;. It is a common technique for playing chords on the harp. To play an arpeggiated chord on the guitar, pick each note of the chord slowly, one string at a time. You can play arpeggios with a plectrum or fingerstyle.

===Exercise 1===
Below is a simple arpeggio study using these chords:

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;

File: D major chord for guitar (open).png|'''D major'''
File: E major chord for guitar (open).png|'''E major'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
==Sweep picking==
'''Sweep picking''' is a more specialized technique, occurring most often in metal. It involves playing a fast arpeggio with a special technique: when switching from one string to the next, mute the note currently ringing by lifting the fretting finger. A sweep can become a rake if notes are muted incorrectly. Rakes can sound nice, but they are not sweeps. Remember only one note can ring out at a time or it won't sound good. It takes practice and it helps to start slow and build up speed. 

Below is example tablature of sweep picking:

[[Image:Guitar-SweepArpeggio.png|Sample tablature for sweep picking]]

This is not the only way to notate sweeps. Small sweeps can be indicated with grace notes or even the arpeggio notation with the word &quot;sweep&quot; (or, less correctly, &quot;rake&quot;) written above.

----

In a more classical approach, arpeggios must follow a distinct pattern of notes depending on the chord/scale we're playing. This is similar to playing chords note-by-note on a piano (not on a guitar). 

The basic chords (the major and minor triads) are composed of three tones: the first, the third and the fifth note of the scale (major or minor, depending on the chord type).

For instance, the C major scale is: C D E F G A B. So, according to the 1-3-5 principle, the C major triad consists of C, E and G. Note that the C major chord on a guitar also consists only of these three notes but they are not always in the 1-3-5 order. Now, while playing &quot;classical arpeggios&quot;, you would not just pick around the chord randomly but you would play C, E, G, then C, E, G an octave higher, etc. This is what is called an arpeggio scale. You can play around it, up and down with complete freedom or just use the 1-3-5 pattern as a bass line. This method can also be used with more complex chords (sus4, maj7, etc.) but then it follows a pattern different from 1-3-5 structure, depending on the chord type. In all, this is a very simple but effective method for composing.

While playing guitar, this might not appear as interesting as picking &quot;full&quot; six-string chords but it can be used to give your music a classical edge. It also has a more lead quality to it than using full chords and requires more skill. Playing fast arpeggios like these is sometimes used in metal music with very satisfactory results. The &quot;classical arpeggios&quot; are in no way better than the &quot;harp like chords&quot; and it is ultimately up to the player/composer to choose what is best for the song in question.

I think the ideas around quine programs are fascinating ( [[Wiki: QuineProgram]] ).

I've been working in [[Python]] recently.
Here's a quine I've written recently:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/python
# quine.py
# 2012-02-29: DAV: started by David Cary

def quine(dna):
    print ( dna.decode('string_escape') + dna + '&quot;&quot;&quot;\n' + 'quine(dna)' )

dna=r&quot;&quot;&quot;#!/usr/bin/python
# quine.py
# 2012-02-29: DAV: started by David Cary

def quine(dna):
    print ( dna.decode('string_escape') + dna + '\&quot;\&quot;\&quot;\\n' + 'quine(dna)' )

dna=r\&quot;\&quot;\&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
quine(dna)
&lt;/source&gt;

I've been editing [[C Programming]] and some [[:Category:C++ programming language]] wikibooks recently.
Here's a quine I've written recently:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void){char d[]=
&quot;\n\\\&quot;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* ANSI C quine by David Cary 2009 */%c&quot;
&quot;int main(void){char d[]=%c%c%cn%c%c%s%c;%c  printf&quot;
&quot;(d+3,*d,*d,d[2],d[1],d[1],d[1],d+1,d[2],*d,*d,*d,*d,*d);%c  return(0);%c}%c%c&quot;;
  printf(d+3,*d,*d,d[2],d[1],d[1],d[1],d+1,d[2],*d,*d,*d,*d,*d);
  return(0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Another quine I've written recently:
(with some inspiration from another ANSI C quine I saw at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?QuineProgram ):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
extern char*d;
int main(){
  fputs(d+37,stdout);
  while(*d!=0){
    char c=*d++;
    if(('\\'==c)||('&quot;'==c)){putchar('\\');};
    if('\n'==c){puts(&quot;\\n\&quot;&quot;);c='&quot;';};
    putchar(c);
  };
  puts(&quot;\&quot;;&quot;); return 0;
}
char*d=&quot;ANSI C quine by David Cary 2010-01-26#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n&quot;

This book is an operators manual for the operation of functional steam locomotives.  The terms and procedures described here will enable a person to safely operate a 19th or 20th century steam locomotive well into the future.

To hostle, fire, or engineer a locomotive effectively, efficiently, and safely, a person should have a good understanding of the construction and the physics that go into a steam engine to produce locomotion as well as an understanding of normal operating techniques.

==Locomotive Construction and Parts==
===The Boiler===
A common later (1940s) boiler design was the radial stay extended wagon top type of locomotive boiler, which consists of an oblong box with a circular top made of steel plating, connected to a cylindrical part which is commonly known as the barrel of the boiler.   That part of the boiler enclosing the firebox is known as the outer casing, or shell.  The firebox corresponds in shape to the back end and sides of the outer casing or shell, a space being provided between the firebox sheets and those of the outer casing which provides for the firebox being surrounded by water.  The front, or cylindrical part of the boiler encloses the flues which are secured at the front to the front flue sheet and at the back to the inner or firebox flue sheet.

This arrangement provides that all parts of the firebox, as well as the flues are completely surrounded by water, and it also provides that when fuel is burned in the firebox, the heat will be transmitted by the flues and firebox plates to the water; the unused gasses and smoke having free passage from the firebox through the flues to the smoke box and smoke stack.

The ''smoke box'' is formed by extending the cylindrical part of the boiler beyond the front flue sheet.  The boiler shell is provided with a steam dome on top of the shell which forms a chamber where steam may collect and free itself from the water in the boiler before passing through the throttle valve to the cylinders.

The flues in a locomotive boiler are known as ''fire tubes'', because the heat passes through them, while the arch tubes, of which there are usually four in each firebox are called &quot;water tubes&quot; because the fire is on the outside, and the water passes through them.

The firebox sheets and flues constitute what is known as the ''heating surface''.  In addition to this heating surface there is additional, or superheater heating surface in many boilers, which superheats the steam after it leaves the boiler and while it is passing from the boiler to the cylinders.  Comparing the flue heating area with that of the area of the firebox plates shows that the plate heating surface equals only 5% of the flue heating surface, but '''the firebox heating surface generates about 40% of the steam'''.  This fact should be remembered.

In the locomotive boiler a large number of small flues are provided instead of a few large flues, in order that the heat and gasses passing from the firebox to the smoke box will be split up and come into contact with a larger flue surface.  If large flues were used, great quantities of heat would pass through the center of the flues without coming into contact with the surface of the flue, such heat would pass away and be lost.  A large number of small tubes also provides for the heat being more evenly distributed through the boiler shell water space.  The small flue can be made of thinner material, which permits the heat to be more easily transmitted to the water which surrounds the flues.  In the extended wagon top type of locomotive boiler, the back part, or outer shell, is considerably larger in diameter than the front section, or cylindrical part;  while the straight type of boiler has the outer shell and cylindrical part of practically the same diameter.  The extended wagon top type therefore allows more steam and water space, and gives superior performance in foaming water conditions.

Locomotive boilers are made entirely of steel, except stay-bolts and stays, which are of iron.  The crown sheet is supported by what are called radial stays, reaching from the crown sheet to the exterior wrapper sheet.

There are three common designs of fireboxes in general use.  The narrow, deep firebox, which is between the frames and extends below the top frame rails.   The semi-wide shallow firebox which rests on top of the frames and extends to the outside edges of the frame rails, and the wide firebox type having a firebox wider than the frames and extending outside the frame rails on both sides, and resting on top of the frame rails, or expansion brackets which are secured to the top of the frames.

===Combustion Chamber===
The combustion chamber for large locomotives was originally introduced for the purpose that its name implies, of providing increased firebox area for combustion purposes.  As locomotives grew larger and the wheel base longer, it then became a question of limiting the length of flues.  It was found that when flues were more than 21 or 22 feet long, there was considerable more trouble in respect to leakage and in order to keep the flues within those limits of length it was necessary to lengthen out the firebox, which was done by extending the flue area into the boiler.

There is also an advantage of the combustion chamber, in addition to allowing shorter flues, the heating surface of the firebox sheets composing the combustion chamber is vastly more efficint than the increased length of flues would be if the combustion chamber was not used.

The combustion chamber also serves to protect the ends of the tubes from cold air which comes up through the grates at the front end of the firebox, in addition to providing a long flameway for the burning gases, which is particularly desirable with oil, or coal, having a large percentage of volatile matter.

===Effect of Heating, Cooling, and Low Water===
When the crown sheet or firebox sheets are not covered with water, they become overheated very quickly with a hot fire in the firebox.  If for any reason water is not maintained over the crown sheet, and the sheet becomes overheated, the fire must be put out or deadened at once, and under no circumstances should cold water be forced into the boiler.  The boiler should be cooled down before any attempt is made to refill it, because forcing cold water into the boiler when it is very hot produces sudden changes in temperature of the various parts of the sheets and sets up destructive strains.

The prevention of destructive strains and stresses, or reducing their amplitude should interest all who have to do with the upkeep of the locomotive.  In order to bring out clearly and simply the cause of destructive stresses, it should fully be understood that the contraction or expansion of a body of metal when changes of temperature occur is irresistible.  '''A firebox sheet expanding or contracting as a result of a change in temperature cannot be restrained'''.  It is certain to find relief in some direction, either by self destruction or destroying the obstacle opposing its movement.

The life of a locomotive boiler or firebox is dependent largely upon the care which it receives while in service.  It is not possible in the operation of a locomotive to avoid all strains and stresses, but it is possible, practical, and beneficial to reduce the frequency of the stresses and also their amplitude.  In other words, if by any means the severity of the strains is reduced even though their frequency be increased, the period between failures will be prolonged, the time between repairs and the life of fireboxes and boilers will be lengthened.

Figure 3, which is a diagram of the boiler shown in Figure 1, illustrates the action of metal when heating and cooling takes place.  It will be noted that the boiler is divided into sections.  After steam is generated in the boiler to 200lbs per square inch, it is found that the boiler has expanded nearly one inch, which demonstrates that the metal expands as heating takes place and that when the boiler cools the metal contracts.  Expansion and contraction of the metals thus sets up strains and stresses at various parts in the boiler, and it is important that as these strains are developed that they be developed slowly, in order that the effect of heating or cooling will be distributed throughout the boiler so that the expansion or contraction will be as uniform as possible throughout all its parts.

===Temperatures of Steam and Water===
Operating a water [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector injector] or water pump while locomotive is standing causes more frequent and greater inequality of temperatures throughout the boiler and the development of more destructive stresses than any other cause.  To illustrate: Temperature of the steam in a locomotive boiler at 190 psi is 383 degrees Fahrenheit (195 degrees Centigrade).  This is also the temperature of the water at that steam pressure.  When an injector is operated, the water passing through the injector on its way to the boiler is heated from 160 to 200 degrees F (71 to 93 degrees C).  It is therefore from 183 to 223 degrees F (102-124 deg C) cooler than the water within the boiler.  The water from the injector being cooler is heavier than the higher temperature water in the boiler, and on entering the boiler must take a downward course and continue downward until it reaches the lowest part.  The weight of a cubic foot of water as it enters the boiler from the injectors is 60 1/8 pounds, while a cubic foot of water at 190 psi steam pressure, or 383 degrees Fahrenheit, is 54 1/4 pounds, or 9% lighter than the water at 200 degrees delivered into the boiler from the injector.  This difference of weight makes it clear why the cooler and heavier water seeks the lower levels and displaces the hotter, lighter water.

-Quick reference to Water boiling point (Not Steam Temp) at different pressures-  The boiling point of water raises 3 degrees F per each pound of square inch pressure added. For example: at sea level, water will boil at 212 degrees F (100 deg C).  +1 PSI over sea level it will raise the boiling point 3 degrees F, to 215 degrees F (1.7 deg C, to 101.7 deg C).   At +5 PSI over sea level the boiling point of water will be 227 degrees F (108.3 deg C).  And so on.  This is why directions for boiling noodles and baking goods at high altitudes require longer cook times, and/or more water added to mixture.

{{clear}}

==The Crew==
===Hostler===
The hostler prepares an engine each day for service. This usually includes starting the fire, greasing and oiling all lubrication points on a steam locomotive. This was traditionally the starting point for a person coming onto the engine crew.

Additonally, Hostlers service locomotives with fuel and water, sand and lubricants and assure that all required tools and flagging equipment are provided on the locomotive.  The firebox is cleaned or banked as necessary upon arrival at the locomotive. 

===Fireman===
The fireman maintains the steam pressure in a locomotive boiler. This is accomplished through careful regulation of the fire, and by regular addition of water to the boiler. Water is added through the use of an injector or feed water pump. In the absence of an Engineer, he will be responsible for the safety and security of the locomotive.  Locomotive Firemen will not operate locomotives unless under the direct supervision of a qualified Engineer.

===Engineer===
The engineer is responsible for ensuring that the engine is fit for operation before and during any movement of the locomotive. The engineer is responsible for its over the road upkeep, oiling and proper operation of the locomotive to be most fuel efficient and easy on the machinery. The engineer controls the operation of the locomotive but the conductor controls the movement of the train, and both are responsible for its safe operation. The steam whistle, headlight, throttle, air brakes, reverse lever, and fireman are usually under the direct control of the engineer.

==Firing==
Firing involves caring for the boiler, and making sure there is always sufficient steam for the engineer to use.  When proficient, a fireman should concentrate on efficient operation to conserve fuel, water and extend the life of the engine.  This is especially important in the 21st century as working steam engines are rare and often in precarious financial situations.

===General Practices===
The boiler of a locomotive is made of a steel alloy and holds thousands of gallons of water.  The boiler must be treated with care at all times, as it must withstand tremendous amounts of heat, pressure and vibration.  The fireman should take care to minimize the thermal stresses placed on the boiler when safety permits.

===Fire less Locomotives===
Fire less locomotives generally used a tank (in place of a boiler and firebox) filled with super heated water that flashed into steam as the pressure from working existing steam dropped the pressure (refer to pressure table above). Fire less locomotives were tied to operating in an area where they could obtain water heated higher than the boiling point while a fire was undesirable for safety reasons. They were used mostly in industries or a group of industries, and due to this limitation were not common for moving trains on main lines. They were replaced by explosion proof diesel or electric locomotives. There are no references to currently operating fire less locomotives found by this author.

===Wood Burning Locomotives===
Wood burning locomotives fell into disfavor in the United States once expansion into the western plain states began, chiefly because of the generally lower amount of thermal energy wood locomotives offered from the fuel, and the scarcity of forests in the plain states.

===Oil Burning Locomotives===
Oil burning locomotives in the steam era mainly used &quot;Bunker C&quot; fuel oil. (Bunker C is also known as Type 6 or Number 6.)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil] While some preserved steam locomotives of today (circa 2005) still use Bunker C, most have switched to various alternative fuels as Bunker C can be difficult to locate, transport, and store. Alternatives include Number 4 fuel oil, kerosene or diesel oil (and sometimes a mixture of diesel/kerosene), others employ used motor oil.

Regardless of the kind of oil used, most locomotives store the fuel in a tank on the tender. The oil tank is equipped with steam heat coils to heat the fuel before combustion. This is done to keep the oil viscosity such that the oil can flow freely to the combustion chamber. Bunker C fuel oil is very thick and difficult to use without pre-heating.

The fire in an oil burning locomotive is controled with two valves: The fuel valve, which controls the flow of oil to the atomizer, and the atomizer valve, which controls the steam to force the oil into small droplets for burning.

The fireman must control the amount of steam, oil, and air in the combustion chamber to produce the most effecient fire to boil the water. The fireman observes the color of the smoke emitted from the smoke stack to determine what the fire needs. Thick, foul smelling black smoke indicates that the fire is not burning correctly due to too much fuel oil. The fireman can increase the draft of air using dampers and the blower or reduce the amount of oil to the burner. Blue smoke indicates too much steam is being admitted to the atomizer, and he must reduce the steam pressure. A light grey smoke indicates proper adjustment, while no smoke at all means the fire is too light and should be increased.

It is worthy to note that under some circumstances, the fireman can cause a series of hollow booms or small explosions though mis-adjustment of the fire. If one were to be watching with the firedoors open at such a time, one would see that the flame is being ripped away from the burner and into the flues. This also can cause heavy amounts of soot to be deposited in the flue, reducing the effeciency of the boiler. The soot can be cleaned by throwing sand into the combustion chamber, but this causes undesireable wear to the flues and any superheaters.

[[Image:Baati.jpg|200px|Baati with dal and shrikhand.]]

'''Baati''' is a hard, unleavened bread cooked in desert areas of Rajasthan, Malwa, and Gujarat in North [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. It is prized there for its exceptionally long life and high energy content, as well as the minimal quantity of water required in its preparation.

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound (450 g) [[Cookbook:Flour|wheat flour]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 tablespoons oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] (for serving)

==Procedure==
# Mix the flour and salt.
# Put about a cup of the mix in a small bowl and add a little oil, mixing it in well and breaking up any lumps.
# Pour in water about a tablespoon at a time and keep kneading with your hands. You only need three or four tablespoons, but you must knead the dough very hard to make it stick together in a ball. The more compact the dough, the better and denser the baati will be.
# Let the balls sit for 5 minutes.
# Flatten out each ball with first your hands and then a rolling pin until they are smooth discs 4 inches (10cm) across and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.
# Cook in a dry metal pan on a low flame.
# Flip once when the bottom begins to harden, then pinch all over with two fingers so the dough is not too thick and has a bumpy texture on one side.
# Check the bottom until it browns in spots, then remove the baati and place it upside-down on a grate or pan with holes in it. This will blacken the top a little, especially on the tops of the pinched bumps.
# To serve, drizzle liberally with ghee and accompany with a dhal or vegetable.

Makes 4-6 Baati

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Variation: Sprinkle [[Cookbook:Powdered sugar|powdered sugar]] on after the ghee for a sweet snack.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Polygon''' is a two-dimensional figure, meaning all of the lines in the figure are contained within one [[Geometry/Points, Lines, Line Segments and Rays|plane]]. They are classified by the number of angles, which is also the number of sides.

One key point to note is that a polygon must have at least three sides. Normally, three to ten sided figures are referred to by their names (below), while figures with eleven or more sides is an ''n''-gon, where ''n'' is the number of sides. Hence a forty-sided polygon is called a 40-gon.

*''[[../Triangle/]]''
     A polygon with three angles and sides.

*''[[../Quadrilaterals|Quadrilateral]]''
     A polygon with four angles and sides.

*''Pentagon''
     A polygon with five angles and sides.

*''Hexagon''
     A polygon with six angles and sides.

*''Heptagon''
     A polygon with seven angles and sides.

*''Octogon''
     A polygon with eight angles and sides.

*''Nonagon''
     A polygon with nine angles and sides.

*''Decagon''
     A polygon with ten angles and sides.

For a list of n-gon names, go to [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polygon.html] and scroll to the bottom of the page.


Polygons are also classified as '''convex''' or '''concave'''. A convex polygon has interior angles less than 180 degrees, thus all triangles are convex. If a polygon has at least one internal angle greater than 180 degrees, then it is concave. An easy way to tell if a polygon is concave is if one side can be extended and crosses the interior of the polygon. Concave polygons can be divided into several convex polygons by drawing diagonals. '''Regular polygons''' are polygons in which all sides and angles are congruent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Diminutives are suffixes that indicate small size, youth, affection or contempt. English examples are ''–y'' in ''doggy'' or ''-let'' in booklet.

The most common Spanish diminutive suffix  is ''-ito/-ita.'' ''Gatito'' means ''small cat,'' particularly ''kitten.'' ''Esté quietecito'' is a nice way of telling someone to keep still. Unlike English, Spanish diminutives can be applied not only to nouns ''(gatito)'' but to adjectives ''(quietecito)'' and adverbs ''(rapidito).''

'''Morphology of  ''-ito/-ita'''''

Diminutives are formed in the following ways
*replacing the last vowel by ''-ito/ita,'' or adding ''-ito/ita'' to the last consonant: ''perro/perrito, papel/papelito.'' If the word ends in the diphthongs ''io/ia'' then only one ''i'' is left: ''despacio/despacito.''
*adding ''-cito/-cita: corazón/corazoncito, duende/duendecito/duendecita.''
*replacing the last vowel by ''-ecito/-ecita,'' or adding ''-ecito/ecita'' to the last consonant: ''quieto/quietecito, pez/pececito, tren/trencito/&lt;u&gt;trenecito&lt;/u&gt;.''
*adding ''-cecito/-cecita:'' ''pie/piecito/&lt;u&gt;piececito&lt;/u&gt;.''

'''Regular formation of diminutives'''
*Words ending in unstressed ''o/a'' or diphthongs ''io/ia'' replace it by ''-ito/-ita:'' ''gata/gatita, Julio/Julito, vacío/vaciíto, feo/feíto.''
*Words ending in unstressed ''e/i/u'' or stressed vowel add ''-cito/-cita:'': ''duende/duendecito/duendecita, whisky/whiskicito, sofá/sofacito''.
*Words ending in ''n'' or ''r'' add ''-cito/-cita:'' ''camión/camioncito, motor/motorcito.''
*Words ending in another consonant add ''-ito/-ita:'' ''farol/farolito, lápiz/lapicito.''
*The diminutive is formed from the masculine and/or singular form. ''Patrón-&gt;patroncito/patroncita,'' not ''patrona-&gt;*patronita.'' ''agua-&gt;agüita-&gt;agüitas-&gt;paragüitas'' and not ''paraguas-&gt;*paraguasito.''

(*) indicates non-existent word.

It follows that all diminutives ending in ''-ecito/-ecita'' are irregular.

Some irregular diminutives: ''novio/noviecito,'' ''pez/pececito,'' Carlos/''Carlitos,'', ''mano/manito/&lt;u&gt;manita&lt;/u&gt;'' ''(manita'' is used in México and Spain), ''caliente/calentito.''

'''Defective words'''

Many words lack a diminutive, such as ''edad/*edadita, bondad/*bondadita, ciudad/*ciudadita'' (but ''maldad/maldadita),'' ''útil/*utilito'' (but ''fácil/facilito),'' ''lunes/*lunesito, …, viernes/*viernesito'' (but ''sábado/sabadito, domingo/dominguito),'' ''espacio/*espacito'' (but ''despacio/despacito),'' ''lenguaje/*lenguajito/*lenguajecito, apetito/*apetitito, termita/*termitita.''

On the other hand there are diminutives that are never used, such as ''autentiquito, peliagudito, emigrantito, cabellerita.''

'''Diminutives of diminutives'''

''chico/chiquito/chiquitito;  poco/poquito/poquitito.''

'''''-ico/-ica'''''

In some countries, particularly Colombia and Cuba the endings ''tito/tita'' are replaced by ''tico/tica:'' ''zapato/zapatico'' (preferred to ''zapatito).'' Other examples: ''pato/patico, rato/ratico.''

'''Other diminutive suffixes'''
*''-illo/-illa: venado/venadillo, mujer/mujercilla.'' (Affectionate, pejoritive.)
*''-ico/-ica: perrico/perrica''
*''-ucho/-ucha:casa/ casucha.'' (Pejoritive.)
*''-ín/ina: pequeñín/pequeñina.'' (Affectionate.)
*''-uelo/uela: ladrón/ ladronzuelo/ladronzuela.'' (Affectionate.)
*''-ete/-eta: viejo/vejete.'' (Pejoritive.)
*''-uco/-uca: perro/perruco.'' (Pejoritive. Used mainly in Cantabria.)

'''Words originated from diminutives'''

Some diminutives have evolved to be new words. For example, a knob is a small pear ''(perilla).'' These words may have their own diminutives ''(perillita).''

*''pera:'' pear; ''perilla:'' knob
*''mano:'' hand; ''manecilla:'' clock hand
*''chico:'' boy; ''chiquillo:'' lad
*''bolso:'' bag; ''bolsillo:'' pocket
*''balanza:'' scale, balance; ''balancín:'' seesaw

Natural gender nouns  may belong to the following categories
*Not inflected (''de género común).'' One form is used for both genders, but the adjectives must agree with the natural gender. ''El artista chileno/la artista chilena; el testigo mentiroso/la testigo mentirosa.''
*Inflected. The feminine is formed from the masculine, normally adding ''a'' or replacing the last vowel by ''a:''  ''el niño/la niña.''
*Both inflected and non inflected: ''el presidente/la presidente/la presidenta.'' Some people have strong views as to whether the inflected or the not inflected form is sexist.

'''Regular inflection of the feminine.'''

If a word ends in a vowel, the feminine replaces that vowel by ''a:'' ''el cliente, la clienta.'' If a word ends in a consonant, the feminine adds an ''a:'' ''el profesor, la profesora.''

'''When nouns are inflected'''

Nouns are inflected or not depending on the ending of the masculine-gender form.
*''o:'' inflected. ''El niño/la niña.'' Exceptions: ''el/la testigo, el ingeniero/la ingeniero/la ingeniera.''
*''a:'' not inflected. ''El/la artista.'' ''El modisto'' is very anomalous. Probably the first male dressmakers invented that word so they wouldn't be confused with women. On the other hand, a male cheerleader is ''un porrista'', not ''un *porristo''. Another exception is ''el poeta/la poeta/la poetisa.'' Feminists prefer ''la poeta'' but ''la poetisa'' is very common.
*''e'' (except ''ante, ente):'' not inflected. ''El detective/la detective.'' There are many exceptions: ''el alcalde/la alcaldesa, el cliente/la cliente/la clienta.''
*''ante:'' not inflected. ''El/la ayudante.'' However words in this category may have an old inflected form, which is not used anymore: ''la ayudanta, la estudianta.''
*''ente''. Prescriptive grammarians say that this words should not be inflected: ''el/la adolescente.'' However, there are many exceptions included in dictionaries: ''el presidente/la presidente/la presidenta, el gerente/la gerente/la gerenta.''
*Stressed vowel: not inflected. ''El/la gurú''.
*Consonant: inflected. ''El profesor/la profesora, el bailarín/la bailarina.'' Exceptions: ''el concejal/la concejal/la concejala, el juez/la juez/la jueza, el/la joven''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Constructive critism (I hope)==

''A electron moving through space creates a magnetic field that spins around the charge according to the right hand rule. The magnetic field is created by the spin of the moving electron. If the wire is bent in the shape of a ring, when its current is flowing it magnetic field will resemble water flowing through a hose. In order for the ring to have a magnetic field, its magnetic field must first displace the magnetic field that is already there. This is why inductors initially resist any changes in current when a voltage is applied. Over time the magnetic field changes to reflect the magnetic field of the ring and current starts flowing''

This paragraph needs a lot of work. The field is created by the moving charge of the electron not it's spin (Well there is a tiny field due to the spin, but i don't think you need to wory about it). if you bend a wire into a ring you gat a torus shaped field, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;resemble water flowing through a hose&quot;. Magnetic fields don't need to displace each other, they just add together.Inductors resist changes in current because the changing current creates a changing magntic field wich in turn creates a back EMF. Apart from these problems the paragraph looks fine ;-) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]

no it is the quantum spin of the particles that make the field because of gravity waves. [[User:67.71.37.148]]

Completely false. Any interaction between quantum spin and gravity is negligible above the Planck scale -- with gravity waves, more so. Magnetic fields are correctly predicted by Maxwell's equations, which are purely classical. If quantum spin were a necessary part of the explanation for magnetism, Maxwell would have not been able to explain it. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]] 05:39, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)

This chapter is not pitched at a consistent level. Some of the material -paramagnetism, diamagnetism, etc- should go to the expanded edition, probably in the introductory basic principles chapter

I agree. That's because I am still reworking the book to figure out what I should include where. Hence the warnings all over the place. When I am done the book will be pitched at a more consistent level and some things will go to the expanded edition and others will vanish. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

But maxwells equations are wrong becaus quantum theory is better 

:Maxwell's equations aren't wrong, in the sense that 1=2 is wrong.
Rather, they are solutions of QED in the classical limit, which means we can with care use them as a guideline to the nature of QED.

:That magnetic fields in the classical limit are accurately described by Maxwell proves that quantum spin doesn't affect the classical behaviour of magnetic fields, which is what this book is concerned with, and hence that an hypothetical spin-0 charged particle will produce a magnetic field when in motion, as can be confirmed by QED. If it didn't Lorentz invariance would be broken, which would be a real mess. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

Are you saying that quantum spin isn't responsible for gravity and magnetism??

are u saying that quantum spin isnt responsibal for gravity and magnatism??

:I am. We don't have a working theory of quantum gravity yet, which makes any claim quantum spin is responsible highly tentative, at best. We can though safely say that any common cause of gravity and magnetism is only going to be relevant at the Planck length, and uttterly irrelevant to this book. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

From what I can tell spin has to do with neutralizing the effects of the magnetic moments of electrons. For a given orbital there are two electrons in it with opposite spins and magnetic moments. If both electrons are there then the moments cancel and if one electron is there than it has a moment and hence a magnetic field.

:Electrons do have a magnetic field proportional to their spin, ''but that is not the sole cause of magnetism''. Anyone moving relative to a charge will see a magnetic field, even if the charge has neither spin nor magnetic moment.[[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

''Spin has to do with exclusion. Electrons come in pairs due to the Pauli exclusion principle, and if only one electron exists then it is affected by magnetism and has a magnetic dipole moment. If both electrons exist the effects cancel.''

The previous paragraph, removed from this chapter, is incorrect.
*Spin has to do with behaviour under rotation. Exclusion is an indirect conseqence.

*Electron states come in pairs because of both the exclusion principle and electrons being spin 1/2

*Paired electrons are still affected by magenetism. All effects do not cancel completely, and the Lorentz force wouldn't cancel anyway. That force is eVxB, proportional to electron ''charge'', not electron ''spin''

I'm not sure where people are getting this misconception from, but there's no doubt it's wrong

==Inductor==
===Self inductance===
This is what happens when you turn on DC in an inductor.

#The voltage increases very rapidly ( in a matter of ms) as you turn on the switch.
#This causes a very rapidly changing current to flow. 
#This current has an associated magnetic fiels which also changes very rapidly.
#The rapildly changing field induced an e.m.f. (Faraday’s Law) that tends to oppose the increase of current (Lenz’s   Law).However it cannot stop it increasing cdompleatly, just slow it down.
#Once the current reaches it's maximum (determined by the voltage ad the ordinary resistance of the wire) it ceases to change, the magnetic field becomes constant and the back EMF goes to zero.

All remains calm until you try to turn the thing off

#The  field collapses very suddenly
#The changing magnetic field induces a back EMF which tries to oppose the collapse of the field (Lenz’s   Law again)

For large coils the EMF can be huge, sparks can fly!

Isn't really an issue for DC though except when turning on and off. But for AC the current is varying all the time, so things never settle into a stready state. The higher the frequency, thwe faster things are changing and so the greater the inductance. I hope all this is reasonably clear now. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:49, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: Surely the inductance (L) doesn't depend on frequency? [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]

::Not for AC purposes, but the impedence due to inductance does (&amp;omega;L), which -- talking loosely -- comes to the same thing.

::At sufficiently high frequencies, capacitators acquire non-negligible inductance and vice versa. Inductance starts changing with frequency, just below the point where it stops being a useful concept, and you have to resort to full EM. For the purposes of this chapter, and of circuit theory generally, we don't need to consider gigahertz frequencies, so we can say inductance and capacitance are constant.[[User:Carandol|Carandol]]
:::Sorry about talking about inductance when i should have said impedence. I don't know why I'm so sloppy all the time, it drives me round the bend it really does. Fortunately there is always some noce person around to correct me. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:32, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

::: The simple relation
&lt;math&gt;
    L\frac{di}{dt} + iR + \int \frac{i}{C} dt = V(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
should handle everything just fine, where L and C depend on only the geometry. [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]

So what do people know about toroids? [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]</text>

1) Visit the Open Mobile Alliance Website, download the pdf of the SyncML v. 1.1 protocol and review it.  Reading this reference is a valuable exercise in learning.  

2) Answer these questions: a. What is WBXML and why is it used? b. How do you foresee SyncML being used in the future? c. Name a problematic situation whereby SyncML is the best 'tool' for the job.

==Answers==

2a.  WBXML is a form of XML that abbreviates XML tags by using a binary representation of the tag.  Tags need to be abbreviated in order to work with mobile devices that have limited bandwidth and limited memory.

2b.  SyncML could be used in any application in which synchronization is needed such as calendars, address books, phone books, inventory tracking, etc.

2c.  An auto mechanic needs to view the work history on cars in the shop.  A PDA can be used to view work logs, active work orders, and to log work done towards a current work order.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Get-back-world-respect. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Get-back-world-respect~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

An ''integrated circuit'' is a collection of very small components etched onto a silicon wafer. The wafer is then cut out and placed into a package usually made out of plastic or ceramic and connected to leads with small wires.

The integrated circuit was independently invented in 1959 by both Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor. (about.com) Their invention led to the modern integrated circuit, devices with millions of transistors and incomprehensible computing power.

= What is SVG? =

Based on XML, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an open-standard vector graphics file format and Web development language created by the W3C, and has been designed to be compatible with other W3C standards such as DOM, CSS, XML, XSLT, XSL, SMIL, HTML, and XHTML. SVG enables the creation of dynamically generated, high-quality graphics from real-time data. SVG allows you to design high-resolution graphics that can include elements such as gradients, embedded fonts, transparency, animation, and filter effects.

SVG files are different from raster or bitmap formats, such as GIF and JPEG that have to include every pixel needed to display a graphic. Because of this, GIF and JPEG files tend to be bulky, limited to a single resolution, and consume large amounts of bandwidth. SVG files are significantly smaller than their raster counterparts. Additionally, the use of vectors means SVG graphics retain their resolution at any zoom level. SVG allows you to scale your graphics, use any font, and print your designs, all without compromising resolution. SVG is XML-based and written in plain text, meaning SVG code can be edited with any text editor. Additionally, SVG offers important advantages over bitmap or raster formats such as:

* '''Zooming''': Users can magnify their view of an image without negatively affecting the resolution.
* '''Text stays text''': Text remains editable and searchable. Additionally, any font may be used.
* '''Small file size''': SVG files are typically smaller than other Web-graphic formats and can be downloaded more quickly.
* '''Display independence''': SVG images always appear crisp on your screen, no matter the resolution. You will never experience “pixelated” images.
* '''Superior color control''': SVG offers a palette of 16 million colors.
* '''Interactivity and intelligence''': Since SVG is XML-based, it offers dynamic interactivity that can respond to user actions.

== Data-driven graphics ==

Because it is written in XML, SVG content can be linked to back-end business processes, databases, and other sources of information.  SVG documents use existing standards such as Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) and Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL), enabling graphics to be easily customized. This results in:

* '''Reduced maintenance costs''': Because SVG allows image attributes to be changed dynamically, it eliminates the need for numerous image files. SVG allows you to specify rollover states and behaviors via scriptable attributes. Complex navigation buttons, for example, can be created using only one SVG file where normally this would require multiple raster files.
* '''Reduced development time''': SVG separates the three elements of traditional Web workflow – content (data), presentation (graphics), and application logic (scripting). With raster files, entire graphics must be completely recreated if changes are made to content.
* '''Scalable server solutions''': Both the client and the server can render SVG graphics. Because the “client” can be utilized to render the graphic, SVG can reduce server loads. Client-side rendering can enhance the user-experience by allowing users to “zoom in” on an SVG graphic. Additionally, the server can be used to render the graphic if the client has limited processing resources, such as a PDA or cell phone. Either way the file is rendered, the source content is the same.
* '''Easily updated''': SVG separates design from content, allowing easy updates to either.

== Interactive graphics ==

SVG allows you to create Web-based applications, tools, or user interfaces. Additionally, you can incorporate scripting and programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Visual Basic. Any SVG element can be used to modify or control any other SVG or HTML element. Because SVG is text based, the text inside graphics can be translated for other languages quickly, which simplifies localization efforts. Additionally, if there is a connection to a database, SVG allows drill-down functionality for charts and graphs. This results in:

* '''Improved end user experience''': Users can input their own data, modify data, or even generate new graphics from two or more data sources.
* '''In SVG, text is text''': As mentioned previously, SVG treats text as text. This makes SVG-based graphics searchable by search engines.
* '''SVG can create SVG''': Enterprise applications such as an online help feature can be developed.

== Personalized graphics ==

SVG can be targeted to people to overcome issues of culture, accessibility, and aesthetics, and can be customized for many audiences and demographic groups. SVG can also be dynamically generated using information gathered from databases or user interaction. The overall goal is to have one source file, which transforms seamlessly in a wide variety of situations. This results in:

* '''One source, customized appearances''': SVG makes it possible to change color and other properties based on aesthetics, culture, and accessibility issues.  SVG can use stylesheets to customize its appearance for different situations.
* '''Internationalization, localization''': SVG supports Unicode characters in order to effectively display text in many languages and fashions – vertically, horizontally, and bi-directionally.
* '''Utilizing existing standards''': SVG works seamlessly with stylesheets in order to control presentation. Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) can be used for typical font characteristics as well as for other SVG graphic elements. For example, you can control the stroke color, fill color, and fill opacity of an element from an external stylesheet.

= SVG vs. Macromedia Flash =

Macromedia has been the dominant force behind vector-based graphics on the web for the last 10 years. It is apparent, however, that SVG provides alternatives to many of the functions of Flash and incorporates many others. The creation of vector-based graphical elements is the base structure of both SVG and Flash. Much like Flash, SVG also includes the ability to create time-based animations for each element and allows scripting of elements via DOM, JavaScript, or any other scripting language that the SVG viewer supports. Many basic elements are available to the developer, including elements for creating circles, rectangles, lines, ellipses, polygons, and text. Much like HTML, elements are styled with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS2) using a style element or directly on a particular graphical element via the style attribute. Styling properties may also be specified with presentation attributes. For each CSS property applicable to an element, an XML attribute specifying the same styling property can also be used. There is an on going debate about whether Flash or SVG is better for web development There are advantages to both, it usually comes down to the situation.

'''Flash Advantages:'''

* Use Flash if you want to make a Flash-like website – replicating the same effect using SVG is hard.
* Use Flash if you want complex animations, or complex games (SVG's built in SMIL animation engine is extremely processor intensive).
* Use Flash if your users will not be so computer literate, for instance a children's site, or a site appealing to a wide audience.
* Use Flash if sound is important – SVG/SMIL supports sound, but it's pretty basic.
* Use Flash if you prefer WYSIWYG to script.

'''SVG advantages:'''

* It's fully scriptable, using a DOM1 interface and JavaScript. That means you can start with an empty SVG image, and build it up using JavaScript.
* SVG can easily be created by ASP, PHP, Perl, etc and extracted from a database.
* It has a built-in ECMA-script (JavaScript) engine, so you don't have to code per browser, and you don't need to learn Flash's action-script.
* SVG is XML, meaning it can be read by anything that can read XML . Flash can use XML, but needs to convert it before use.
* This also allows SVG to be transformed through an XSLT stylesheet/parser.
* SVG supports standard CSS1 stylesheets.
* Text used in SVG remains selectable and searchable.
* You only need a text editor to create SVG, as opposed to buying Flash.
* SVG is an web real standard (not just “de facto”), supported by various different programs, some of which are free software (and thus available for most free computer operating systems).

= Why use SVG? =

SVG is emerging through the efforts of the W3C and its members. It is open source and as such does not require the use of proprietary languages and development tools as does Macromedia Flash. Because it is XML-based, it looks familiar to developers and allows them to use existing skills. SVG is text based and can be learned by leveraging the work (or code) of others, which significantly reduces the overall learning curve. Additionally, because SVG can incorporate JavaScript, DOM, and other technologies, developers familiar with these languages can create graphics in much the same way.  SVG is also highly compatible because it works with HTML, GIF, JPEG, PNG, SMIL, ASP, JSP, and JavaScript. Finally, graphics created in SVG are scalable and do not result in loss of quality across platforms and devices. SVG can therefore be used for the Web, in print, as well as on portable devices while retaining full quality.

= SVG Viewer =

== The Adobe SVG Viewer ==

The Adobe SVG Viewer is available as a downloadable plug–in that allows SVG to be viewed on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems in all major browsers including Internet Explorer (versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x), Netscape (versions 4.x, 6.x), and Opera in Internet Explorer and Netscape.

The Adobe SVG Viewer is the most widely deployed SVG Viewer and it supports almost all of the SVG Specification including support for the SVG DOM, animation and scripting.

'''Features of the Adobe SVG Viewer'''
Click the right mouse button (CTRL-Key + mouse click in Mac) over your SVG image to get a context menu. The context menu gives you several options, which can all be accessed utilizing the menu itself or “hotkeys”:

&lt;small&gt;Table 1: Features of the Adobe SVG Viewer&lt;/small&gt;

{| width=&quot;800&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;200&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;background:lightgrey;text-align:center&quot; | Function
| width=&quot;600&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;background:lightgrey;text-align:center&quot; | Description
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | Zoom In || 
Using the CTRL-Key (or Apple-Key) you can drag your
mouse to make a rectangle that specifies the cross-section of the area you
will zoom to.
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | Zoom Out
|
This work just like “Zoom In” except you press the
CTRL-Key and the SHIFT-Key at the same time.
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | Panning || 
Pressing the ALT-Key
and move the mouse cursor while a hand-icon appears.
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | Copy SVG
|
The purpose of the SVG Viewers “Copy SVG” options is
for users to be able to cut-and-paste graphics and/or source code into other
applications. Using “Copy SVG”
developers are able to make a copy of the source code, which can be pasted
into any text editor. Also, after
selecting “Copy SVG” and switching to a desktop application such as MS Office
users are able to choose either to use the Edit/Paste
option to produce a snapshot of the SVGs DOM-tree
code (this contains the current structure of the dynamic SVG image) or users
can use the Edit/Paste Special option to translate the SVG into a Bitmap image. These options are likely to improve and
increase as support for SVG improves in other applications.
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | View Source
|
The SVG Viewers “View Source” menu options allow
both compressed and uncompressed SVG source code to instantly be viewed as
text in a new browser window. This is
a very handy option for designers and developers.
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; | Save SVG as…
|
This option allows for quickly saving of SVG content
to your local computer by popping up a “save SVG as” form that gives you the
option to input the name and location of the file. In version 3 of the Adobe SVG Viewer the option of Saving as GZip compressed SVG (.svgz) was added to the 'save as’
dialog box.
|}

== SMIL ==

The Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL, pronounced “smile”) enables simple authoring of interactive audiovisual presentations. SMIL is typically used for “rich media”/multimedia presentations which integrate streaming audio and video with images, text or any other media type. SMIL is an easy-to-learn HTML-like language, and many SMIL presentations are written using a simple text-editor. SMIL can be used with XML to enable video and sound when viewing a SVG.

== Attention Microsoft Windows Mozilla users! ==

The Seamonkey and Mozilla Firefox browsers have SVG support enabled natively. If desired, the Adobe SVG Viewer plugin will work with Mozilla Firefox, or the Seamonkey browser. [http://kb.mozillazine.org/Adobe_SVG_Viewer] Webkit based browsers also have some SVG support natively.

== Native SVG (Firefox) ==

The Mozilla SVG implementation is a native SVG implementation. This is as opposed to plug-in SVG viewers such as the Adobe viewer (which is currently the most popular SVG viewer).

Some of the implications of this are:

* Mozilla can handle documents that contain SVG, MathML, XHTML, XUL, etc. all mixed together in the same 'compound' document. This is being made possible by using XML namespaces.
* Mozilla is 'aware' of the SVG content. It can be accessed through the SVG DOM (which is compatible with the XML DOM) and manipulated by Mozilla's script engine.
* Other Mozilla technologies can be used with SVG. XBL coupled with SVG is a particular interesting combination. It can be used to create graphical widgets (I wonder when we'll see the first SVG-based chrome!) or extend Mozilla to recognize other specialized languages such as e.g. CML (chemical markup language). There are samples of these kinds of more advanced usage patterns on http://croczilla.com/svg/.

== rsvg-view ==

rsvg-view program is a part of the librsvg package&lt;ref&gt;[http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/ libsrsvg - free, open source SVG rendering library]&lt;/ref&gt;. It may be used as the default svg opener. It can resize svgs and export them to png which is often the only thing one needs to do with an svg file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bkhome.org/blog/?viewDetailed=02088 Barry Kauler blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

= Creating SVG files =

== How to do it ==

One can use 4 groups of programs :

* general text editors, like Notepad ++ ( with XML syntax highlithning)
* specialized svg editors
* programs that can exports svg ( like gnuplot, Maxima CAS)
* own programs to create svg files directly thru concatenate of strings

=== SVG editors ===

As you can see from the previous example of a path definition, SVG files are written in an extremely abbreviated format to help minimize file size.  However, they can be very difficult to write depending on the complexity of your image. There are SVG editor tools that can help make this task easier. Some of these tools are:

== Getting started ==

Because it is based on XML, SVG follows standard XML conventions. Every SVG file is contained within an &lt;svg&gt; tag as its parent element. SVG can be embedded within a parent document or used independently. For example, the following shows an independent SVG document:

'''Exhibit 1: Creating a SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first line declares that the code that follows is XML. Note the “standalone” attribute. This denotes that this particular file does not contain enough processing instructions to function alone. In order to attain the required functionality it needs to display a particular image, the SVG file must reference an external document.

The second line provides a reference to the Document Type Definition, or DTD. As mentioned in Chapter 7: XML Schemas, the DTD is an alternate way to define the data contained within an XML instanced document. Developers familiar with HTML will notice the DTD declaration is similar to that of an HTML document, but it is specific for SVG. For more information about DTDs, visit: http://www.w3schools.com/dtd/dtd_intro.asp

'''Hint:''' Many IDEs (ex. NetBeans) do not have SVG “templates” built in to the tool. Therefore, it may be easier to use a simple text editor when creating SVG documents. Once you have an SVG Viewer installed, you should then be able to open and view your SVG document with any browser. When creating your SVG documents, remember to:

* Declare your document as an XML file
* Make sure your SVG document elements are between &lt;svg&gt; element tags, including the SVG namespace declaration.
* Save your file with a .svg file extension.
* It is not necessary do include a DOCTYPE statement, which includes information to identify this as an SVG document (since SVG 1.2 there is also not more such).&lt;ref&gt;W3C SVG 1.1 Recommendation: [//www.w3.org/TR/SVG/single-page.html#intro-NamespaceAndDTDIdentifiers SVG Namespace, Public Identifier and System Identifier], see also W3C SVG 2 Editor’s Draft: [//svgwg.org/svg2-draft/single-page.html#intro-Namespace SVG namespace and DTD] (06 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SVG authoring and web server configuration guidelines. ''Jonathan Watt'' [//jwatt.org/svg/authoring/#doctype-declaration Don't include a DOCTYPE declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mozilla on SVG: [//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course Namespaces Crash Course], [//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started Getting Started]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;svg&gt; element on line 5 defines the SVG document, and can specify, among other things, the user coordinate system, and various CSS unit specifiers. Just like with XHTML documents, the document element must include a namespace declaration to declare the element as being a member of the relevant namespace (in this case, the SVG namespace). Within the &lt;svg&gt; element, there can be three types of drawing elements: text, shapes, and paths.

== Text ==

The following is an example of the text element:
'''Exhibit 2: Using text with SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;svg width=&quot;5.5in&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;0.5in&quot;&gt;
   &lt;text y=&quot;15&quot; fill=&quot;red&quot;&gt;This is SVG.&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;



The &lt;svg&gt; element on line 4 specifies: 1) that white space within text elements will be retained, 2) the width and height of the SVG document — particularly important for specifying print output size. In this example, the text is positioned in a 5.5 inches wide by .5 inches tall image area. The “y” attribute on line 5 declares that the text element’s baseline is 15 pixels down from the top of the SVG document. An omitted “x” attribute on a text element implies an x coordinate of 0.

Because SVG documents use a W3C DTD, you can use the W3C Validator to validate your document. Notice that the “style” attribute is used to describe the presentation of the text element. The text could equivalently have been given a red color by use of a presentation attribute fill=&quot;red&quot;.

== Shapes ==

SVG contains the following basic shape elements:

* Rectangles
* Circles
* Ellipses
* Lines
* Polylines
* Polygons

These basic shapes, along with “paths” which are covered later in the chapter, constitute the graphic shapes of SVG. Because is this an introduction to SVG, we will only cover rectangle and circle shapes here. For more information on all shapes, please visit: http://www.w3schools.com/svg/default.asp

=== Rectangles ===

The &lt;rect&gt; element defines a rectangle which is axis-aligned with the current user coordinate system, the coordinate system that is currently active and which is used to define how coordinates and lengths are located and computed on the current canvas. Rounded rectangles can be created by setting values for the rx and ry attributes.

The following example produces a blue rectangle with its top left corner aligning with the top left corner of the image area. This utilizes the default value of “0” for the x and y attributes.

'''Exhibit 3: Creating a rectangle in SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; top=&quot;0in&quot; width=&quot;5.5in&quot; height=&quot;2in&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rect fill=&quot;blue&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It will produce this result:

[[File:XML example rect.svg|Example of SVG use of rectangle shape]]

=== Circles ===

A circle element requires three attributes: cx, cy, and r. The 'cx’ and 'cy’ values specify the location of the center of the circle while the 'r’ value specifies the radius. If the 'cx’ and 'cy’ attributes are not specified then the circle's center point is assumed to be (0, 0). If the 'r’ attribute is set to zero then the circle will not appear. Unlike 'cx’ and 'cy’, the 'r’ attribute is not optional and must be specified. In addition the keyword stroke creates an outline of the image. Both the width and the color can be changed.

'''Exhibit 4: Creating a circle in SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
    &lt;circle cx=&quot;100&quot; cy=&quot;50&quot; r=&quot;40&quot; stroke=&quot;darkslategrey&quot; stroke-width=&quot;2&quot; fill=&quot;red&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It will produce this result:

[[File:XML example circle.svg|Example of SVG use of circle shape]]

== Polygons ==

A polygon is any geometric shape consisting of three or more sides. The 'points' attributes describes the (x,y) coordinates that specify the corners points of the polygon. For this specific example, there are three points which indicate that a triangle will be produced.

'''Exhibit 5: Creating a Polygon in SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;svg width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;
   &lt;polygon points=&quot;220,100 300,210 170,250&quot; style=&quot;fill:#blue;stroke:red;stroke-width:2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It will produce this result:

[[File:XML example polygon.svg]]

== Paths ==

Paths are used to draw your own shapes in SVG, and are described using the following data attributes:

&lt;small&gt;Table 2: SVG Paths&lt;/small&gt;

{| width=&quot;800&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold;background:lightgrey;text-align:center&quot;
| Attribute
| Command
| Parameters
| Function
| Description
|-
| Moveto || M || x y || Set a new current point
| Start a new sub-path at the given (x,y) coordinate.
|-
| Lineto || L || x y || Draw a straight line || 
Draw a line from the current point to the given
(x,y) coordinate which becomes the new current point.
|-
| Horizontal lineto || H || x || Draw a horizontal line || 
Draws a horizontal line from the current point (cpx,
cpy) to (x, cpy).
|-
| Vertical lineto || V || y || Draw a vertical line || 
Draws a vertical line from the current point (cpx,
cpy) to (cpx, y).
|-
| Curveto || C || x1 y1 x2 y2 x y
| Draw a curve using a cubic Bezier || 
Draws a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to
(x,y) using (x1,y1) as the control point at the beginning of the curve and
(x2,y2) as the control point at the end of the curve.
|-
| Smooth curveto || S || x2 y2 x y
| Draw a shorthand/smooth curve using a cubic Bezier
|
Draws a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to
(x,y). The first control point is assumed to be the reflection of the second
control point on the previous command relative to the current point. (x2,y2) is the second control point (i.e.,
the control point at the end of the curve)
|-
| Quadratic Belzier curveto || Q || x1 y1 x y
| Draws a quadratic Bézier curve || 
Draws a
quadratic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y) using (x1,y1) as the
control point.
|-
| Smooth quadratic Belzier curveto || T
| x y
| Draws a shorthand/smooth quadratic Bézier curve
|
Draws a
quadratic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y).
|-
| Elliptical arc || A
| rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y
| Draw an elliptical or circular arc || 
Draws an elliptical arc from the current point to
(x, y). The size and orientation of the ellipse are defined by two radii (rx,
ry) and an x-axis-rotation, which indicates how the ellipse as a whole is
rotated relative to the current coordinate system. The center (cx, cy) of the
ellipse is calculated automatically to satisfy the constraints imposed by the
other parameters. large-arc-flag and sweep-flag contribute to the automatic
calculations and help determine how the arc is drawn.
|-
| Closepath || Z || (none) || 
Close the current path by drawing a line to the last
moveto point
|
Close the current sub path by drawing a straight line
from the current point to current sub path’s initial point.
|}

The following example produces the shape of a triangle. The “M” indicates a “moveto” to set the first point. The “L” indicates “lineto” to draw a line from “M” to the “L” coordinates. The “Z” indicates a “closepath”, which draws a line from the last set of L coordinates back to the M starting point.

'''Exhibit 6: Creating paths in SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; width=&quot;5.5in&quot; height=&quot;2in&quot;&gt;
    &lt;path d=&quot;M 50 10 L 350 10 L 200 120 z&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It produces this result:

= Validation =

After creating file check its code with the W3C Validatior&lt;ref&gt;[http://validator.w3.org/ validator w3.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

= Optimisation =

Even code without errors can be improved. For example grouping elements makes code shorter.

= Including SVG in HTML =

There are three methods to include SVG in an HTML document. Basically, the SVG document is first created as a stand-alone file. It is then referenced in the HTML document using one of the following commands:

&lt;small&gt;Table 4: Including SVG in HTML&lt;/small&gt;

{| width=&quot;800&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|- style=&quot;font-weight:bold;background:lightgrey;text-align:center&quot;
| Command
| Advantages
| Disadvantages
|-
| &amp;lt;embed&amp;gt; || 

# Supported in nearly any browser
# Allows html2svg and svg2html scripting
# Recommended by Adobe for their SVG Viewer

|

# Not clearly standardized within any HTML specification

|-
| &amp;lt;object&amp;gt; || 

# HTML4 and higher standard
# Supported in newer browser generations

|

# Works on newer browsers but without html2svg and svg2html scripting

|-
| &amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt; || 

# Works in most browsers, but not documented

|

# Generates a window-like border without specific styling

|}

== Embed ==

The syntax is as follows:
'''Exhibit 7: Embedding SVG into HTML using keyword embed'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;embed src=&quot;canvas.svg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; name=&quot;emap&quot;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

An additional attribute, “pluginspage”, can be set to the URL where the plug-in can be downloaded:

&lt;code&gt;pluginspage=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

== Object ==

The syntax is as follows and conforms to the HTML 4 Strict specification:
'''Exhibit 8: Embedding SVG into HTML using keyword object'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;object type=&quot;image/svg+xml&quot; name=&quot;omap&quot; data=&quot;canvas_norelief.svg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;176&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Between the opening and the closing &amp;lt;object&gt; tags, information for browsers that do not support objects can be added:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;object ...&gt;You should update your browser&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Unfortunately some browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4 do not show this alternative content if the type attribute has been set to something other than text/html.

== Iframe ==

The syntax is as follows and conforms to the HTML 4 Transitional specification:
'''Exhibit 9: Embedding SVG into HTML using keyword iframe'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;canvas_norelief.svg&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;176&quot; name=&quot;imap&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Between the opening and the closing &amp;lt;iframe&gt; tags, information for browsers that do not support iframes can be added:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe ...&gt;You should update your browser&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Creating 3D SVG images ==

''Section by Charles Gunti, UGA Master of Internet Technology Program, Class of 2007''

Sometime we may want to view an SVG image in three dimensions. For this we will need to change the viewpoint of the graphic. So far we have created two dimensional graphics, such as circles and squares. Those exist on a simple x, y plane. If we want to look at something in three dimensions we have to add the z coordinate plane. The z plane is already there, but we are looking at it straight on, so if data is changed on z it doesn't look any different to the viewer. We need to add another parameter to the data file, the z parameter.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;data&gt;
  &lt;subject x_axis=&quot;90&quot; y_axis=&quot;118&quot; z_axis=&quot;0&quot; color=&quot;red&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;subject x_axis=&quot;113&quot; y_axis=&quot;45&quot; z_axis=&quot;75&quot; color=&quot;purple&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;subject x_axis=&quot;-30&quot; y_axis=&quot;-59&quot; z_axis=&quot;110&quot; color=&quot;blue&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;subject x_axis=&quot;60&quot; y_axis=&quot;-50&quot; z_axis=&quot;-25&quot; color=&quot;yellow&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Once we have the data we will use XSLT to create the SVG file. The SVG stylesheet is the same as other stylesheets, but we need to ensure an SVG file is created during the transformation. We call the SVG namespace with this line in the declarations:

  xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg

Another change we should make from previous examples is to change the origin of (0, 0). We change the origin in this example because some of our data is negative. The default origin is at the upper left corner of the SVG graphic. Negative values are not displayed because, unlike traditional coordinate planes, negative values are above positive values. To move the origin we simply add a line of code to the stylesheet. Before going over that line, let's look at The g element. The container element, g, is used for grouping related graphics elements. Here, we'll use g to group together our graphical elements and then we can apply the transform. Here is how we declare g and change the origin to a point 300 pixels to the right and 300 pixels down:

  &lt;g transform=&quot;translate(300,300)&quot;&gt;''graphical elements''&lt;/g&gt;

SVG transformations are pretty simple, until it comes to changing the viewpoint. SVG has features such as rotating and skewing the image in two dimensions, but it cannot rotate the coordinate system in three dimensions. For that we will need to use some math and a little Java. When rotating in three dimensions two rotations need to be made, one around the y axis, and another around the x axis.
The first rotation will be around the y axis and the formula will look like this:

&lt;math&gt;z' = z \cdot \cos(-Az) - x \cdot \sin(-Az)&lt;/math&gt;  ''Az is the angle the z axis will be rotated''

&lt;math&gt;x' = z \cdot \sin(-Az) - x \cdot \cos(-Az)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt; ''y will not change because we are rotating around the y axis''

The second rotation will be around the x axis. Keep in mind that one rotation has already been made, so instead of using x, y, and z values we need to use x', y', and z' (x-prime, y-prime and z-prime) found in the last rotation. The formula will look like this:

z&quot; = z'*cos(Ay) – y'*sin(Ay) ''Ay is the angle of rotation on the y axis''

y&quot; = z'*sin(Ay) + y'*cos(Ay)

x&quot; = x' ''Remember we are rotating around the x axis, so this does not change''

Remember from trig class the old acronym '''SOH CAH TOA'''? This means

''Sin = Opposite/Hypotenuse''
''Cos = Adjacent/Hypotenuse''
''Tan = Opposite/Adjacent''

And we use those functions to find the angles needed for our rotations. Based of the previous two formulas we can make the following statements about Az and Ay:

tan(Az) = Xv/Zv

sin(Ay) = Yv/sqrt(Xv2 + Yv2 + Zv2)

With so many steps to take to make the rotation we should drop all of this information into a Java class, then call the class in the stylesheet. The Java class should have methods for doing all of the calculations for determining where the new data points will go once the rotation is made. Creating that java class is beyond the scope of this section, but for this example I'll call it ViewCalc.class.

Now that we can rotate the image, we need to integrate that capability into the transformation. We will use parameters to pass viewpoints into the stylesheet during the transformation. The default viewpoint will be (0, 0, 0) and is specified on the stylesheet like so:

'''Exhibit 10: 3D images with SVG'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
     &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
           xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;
           xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- default viewpoint in case they are not specified  --&gt;
        &lt;!-- from the command line --&gt;
        &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;viewpoint_x&quot;&gt;0&lt;/xsl:param&gt;
        &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;viewpoint_y&quot;&gt;0&lt;/xsl:param&gt;
        &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;viewpoint_z&quot;&gt;0&lt;/xsl:param&gt;
     &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
      …
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Java now needs to be added to the stylesheet so the processor will know what methods to call. Two lines are added to the namespace declarations:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
     &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot;
         xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;
         xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;
         &lt;b&gt;xmlns:java=&quot;ViewCalc&quot;
         exclude-result-prefixes=&quot;java&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Notice the ''exclude-result-prefixes=&quot;java&quot;'' line. That line is added so things in the stylesheet with the ''java:'' prefix will be processed, not output. Be sure to have the ViewCalc class in the CLASSPATH or the transformation will not run.

The final step is to call the methods in the ViewCalc class from the stylesheet. For example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
         &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;locationx&quot; select=&quot;@x_axis&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;locationy&quot; select=&quot;@y_axis&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;locationz&quot; select=&quot;@z_axis&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;thisx&quot; select=&quot;java:locationX($locationx,$locationy,
          $locationz, $viewpoint_x, $viewpoint_y,
          $viewpoint_z)&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;thisy&quot; select=&quot;java:locationY($locationx,
          $locationy, $locationz, $viewpoint_x, $viewpoint_y,
          $viewpoint_z)&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Finally we pass new parameters and run the XSL transformation to create the SVG file with a different viewpoint.

| SVG stands for Scalable Vector graphics. Meaning that it creates an image that will not lose image quality when moving or changing the size. Similar to Flash in functionality, neither is better than the other, they are however better in particular situations (some of which were listed earlier.) Can create both 2D and 3D images via SVG. Supported by W3C.

The '''Basic''' demo demonstrates the effects of zooming, panning, and anti-aliasing (high quality).

The '''Fills''' demo demonstrates the effects of colors and transparency. The black circle is drag-able. Simply click and drag the circle within the square to see the changes.

The '''HTML, JS, Java Servlet''' demo describes an interactive, database-driven, seating diagram, where chairs represent available seats for a performance. If the user moves the mouse pointer over a seat, it changes color, and the seat detail (section, row, and seat number) and pricing are displayed. On the client side of the application, SVG renders the seating diagram and works with JavaScript to provide user interactivity. The SVG application is integrated with a server-side database, which maintains ticket and event availability information and processes ticket purchases. The Java Servlet handles form submission and updates the database with seat purchases.

The '''HTML, JS, DOM''' demo shows how SVG manages and displays data, generating SVG code from data on the fly. Although this kind of application can be written in a variety of different ways, SVG provides client-side processing to maintain and display the data, reducing the load on the server as well as overall latency. Using the DOM, developers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.

The '''PHP, MySQL''' demo shows the use of database driven SVG generation utilizing MySQL. It randomly generates a map of a European country. Each time you reload the page you will see a different country.

The '''HTML5, ANGULARJS, PostGreSQL''' demo shows how to create a SVG, then integrate variable data into the SVG &amp; spool a variable data pdf.

'''Garlic croutons''' can be purchased but are much better when made from old bread. They are a crucial ingredient of [[Cookbook:Caesar_Salad|Caesar Salad]].

==Ingredients==
*4 slices day-old French bread, cubed
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive_oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste

Makes enough croutons for 4 servings of salad.

==Procedure==
# Pour the olive oil into a shallow bowl over the garlic and let it soak. Soaking it longer will yield more garlic flavor
# Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (~180 degrees Celsius).
# Strain the olive oil into a pan and fry the bread cubes in it, tossing to coat with oil.
# Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and garnish with salt. Bake for 10 minutes or until crispy and dry.

==Variants==

To make non-garlic croutons, simply omit the garlic.

One may omit the prep work of mincing the garlic by adding the whole cloves of garlic to the oil and then crushing the garlic (either with a mortar or a fork).

By using very small bread cubes, frying crisp, and omitting the baking, these croutons may be used in place of potatoes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Electrolytic capacitor==

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: [[:w:Electrolytic_capacitor|Electrolytic_capacitor]]

An electrolytic capacitor is a type of capacitor with a larger capacitance per unit volume than other types, making them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical circuits. This is especially the case in power-supply filters, where they store charge needed to moderate output voltage and current fluctuations, at the frequency or twice the frequency of AC input power, in rectifier output, and especially in the absence of rechargeable batteries that can provide similar low-frequency current capacity.

Electrolytic capacitors are constructed from two conducting aluminium foils, one of which is coated with an insulating oxide layer, and a paper spacer soaked in electrolyte. The foil insulated by the oxide layer is the anode while the liquid electrolyte and the second foil act as cathode. This stack is then rolled up, fitted with pin connectors and placed in a cylindrical aluminium casing. (Two popular geometries use axial leads, or two leads or lugs in one circular face of the cylinder, respectively.)

A common modelling circuit for an electrolytic capacitor has the following schematic:

               R_leak
               _______
        o-----|_______|-----o
        |                   |
        |                   |    
 (+)    |        ||         |      _______                 (-)
  0-----o--------||---------o-----|_______|-----oOoOoOo-----0
                 ||                 R_ESR        L_ESL
                C

where R_leak is the leakage resistance, R_ESR is the Equivalent Series Resistance, L_ESL the Equivalent Series Inductance (L being the conventional symbol for inductance).

R_ESR must be as small as possible since it determines the loss power when the capacitor is used to smooth voltage. Loss power scales linearly with the ripple current flowing through and quadratically with R_ESR. Low ESR capacitors are imperative for high efficiencies in power supplies.

It should be pointed out that this is only a simple model and does not include all the effects associated with real electrolytic capacitors.

Since the electrolytes evaporate, design life is most often rated in hours at a set temperature. For example, typically as 2000 hours at 105 degrees Celsius (which is the highest working temperature). Design life doubles for each 10 degrees lower, reaching 15 years at 45 degrees.

Electrolytic capacitors may explode (have weak link safety valve) when charged up with wrong polarity.

What are they made of

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors contain aluminum foil, porous paper, and an electrolyte. This is usually boric acid or sodium borate in water with some sugars or ethylene glycol added to retard evaporation. While you should not eat this, nor get it in your eyes, it is not very corrosive or dangerous. Simply wash it off your skin after you gut the old capacitor.

Wet-slug tantalum electrolytics (low voltage and so expensive that only the military can generally afford them) do contain sulfuric acid. I doubt if these are ever found in audio equipment.

It is important, however, to always be careful and not take chances. Safety glasses are always advised. With chemicals, extra precaution is always worthwhile.

=Diagnostic and Testing Equipment=

There is a wide array of devices used to test and diagnose electronic equipment. This chapter will attempt to explain the differences and different types of equipment used by electronics technicians and engineers. 

==Ammeter==
An ammeter measures current.Current in electronics is usually measured in mA which are called milliamperes, which are 1/1000s of an ampere.&lt;br/&gt;. The ammeter's terminals must be ''in series'' with the current being measured.  Ammeters have a small resistance (typically 50 ohms) so that they only have a small effect on the current.

:[[File:0 Polímero GFDL.jpg|300px]]

Basically an ammeter consists of a coil that can rotate inside a magnet, but a spring is trying to push the coil back to zero. The larger the current that flows through the coil, the larger the angle of rotation, the torque (= a rotary force) created by the current being counteracted by the return torque of the spring.&lt;br/&gt;. Usually ammeters are connected in parallel with various switched resistors that can extend the range of currents that can be measured. Assume, for example, that the basic ammeter is &quot;1000 ohms per volt&quot;, which means that to get the full-scale deflection of the pointer a current of 1 mA is needed (1 volt divided by 1000 ohms is 1 mA - see &quot;Ohm's Law&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;. To use that ammeter to read 10 mA full-scale it is ''shunted'' with another resistance, so that when 10 mA flows, 9 mA will flow through the shunt, and only 1 mA will flow through the meter. Similarly, to extend the range of the ammeter to 100 mA the shunt will carry 99 mA, and the meter only 1 mA.

==Ohmmeter==
An ohmmeter measures resistance.The two terminals of ohmmeter are each placed on a terminal of the resistance being measured. This resistance should be isolated from other effects. (It should be taken out of a circuit, if it is in one.)

Ohmmeters are basically ammeters that are ''connected to an internal battery, with a suitable resistance in series''. Assume that the basic ammeter is &quot;1000 ohms per volt&quot;, meaning that 1 mA is needed for full-scale deflection. When the external resistance that is connected to its terminals is zero (the leads are connected together at first for calibration), then the internal, variable, resistor in series with the ammeter is adjusted so that 1 mA will flow; that will depend on the voltage of the battery, and as the battery runs down that setting will change. The full scale point is marked as zero resistance. If an external resistance is then connected to the terminals that causes only half of the current to flow (0.5 mA in this example), then the external resistance will equal the internal resistance, and the scale is marked accordingly. When no current flows, the scale will read infinity resistance. The scale of an ohmmeter is NOT linear.Ohmmeters are usually usuful in cheking the short circuit and open circuit in boards.

==Voltmeter==
A voltmeter measures voltage.The voltmeter's terminals must be ''in parallel'' with the voltage being measured.  Voltmeters have a large resistance (typically 1 megaohm), so that they only have a small effect on the voltage.
:[[File:Fluke 87 III True RMS Multimeter.jpg|300px]]

==Multimeter==
:[[File:Digital Multimeter Aka.jpg|300px]]
A multimeter is a combination device, (usually) capable of measuring current, resistance, or voltage. Most modern models measure all three, and include other features such as a diode tester, which can be used to measure continuity in circuits (emitting a loud 'beep' if there is a short).

==Oscilloscope==
An oscilloscope, commonly called a 'scope' by technicians, is used to display a voltage waveform on a screen, usually graphing voltage as a function of time.
:[[File:Oscilloscope.jpg|400px]]

==Spectrum Analyzer==
Spectrum analyzer shows voltage (or power) densities as function of frequency on radio frequency spectrum. Spectrum analyzer can use analog frequency scanning principle (like radio receiver always changing frequency and measuring receiving amplitude) or digital sampling and FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation).
:[[File:FSL.jpg|400px]]

==Logic analyzer==
A logic analyzer is, in effect, a specialised oscilloscope. The key difference between an analyzer and an oscilloscope is that the analyzer can only display a digital (on/off) waveform, whereas an oscilloscope can display any voltage (depending on the type of probe connected). The other difference is that logic analyzers tend to have many more signal inputs than oscilloscopes - usually 32 or 64, versus the two channels most oscilloscopes provide. Logic analyzers can be very useful for debugging complex logic circuits, where one signal's state may be affected by many other signals.
:[[File:Logic probe new.jpg]]

==Frequency counter==
A frequency counter is a relatively simple instrument used to measure the frequency of a signal in Hertz (cycles per second). Most counters work by counting the number of signal cycles that occur in a given time period (usually one second). This count is the frequency of the signal in Hertz, which is displayed on the counter's display.
:[[File:Frequency counter.JPG|300px]]

==Electrometer==
A voltmeter with extremely high input resistance capable of measuring electrical charge with minimal influence to that charge. Ubiquitous in nucleonics, physics and bio-medical disciplines. Enables the direct verification of charge measured in coulombs according to Q=CV. Additionally, electrometers can generally measure current flows in the femtoampere range, i.e. .000000000000001 ampere.

==Signal Generator==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the second part of the Electronics book. It deals with topics that are related to Electronics but don't quite fit into an Electronics book. As this is the second part editors can stop showing restraint towards math. Long live Greek. 

----

A lot of the physics is covered in the physics textbooks.. Eh, I don't really know.

It is true that these subjects are covered elsewhere, but this part of the book talks about them in terms of Electricity and Magnetism. A good example is Optics. Normally when people talk about Optics they talk about visible light. My question is how optics works throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. For instance at higher frequencies light will destroy mirrors rather than being reflected by it. (At higher POWERS - at higher frequencies it may not be reflected particularly efficiently, or perhaps not even reach the mirror).

: Yes, at high enough power, visible light will heat up and melt a mirror.
: But also, at high enough frequencies (X rays), a single photon carries enough energy to knock an electron completely out of a mirror, or break the bond between one atom and the next.
: Either one will destroy a mirror.

&lt;Electronics normally just refers to circuitry containing non-linear elements; transistors, diodes, semiconductors, etc. This book appears to covering a much wider range: all of circuit theory, and most of classical electomagnetism.

Perhaps it would be better called 'Simple electrity and magentism', maybe covering circuit theory, electrostatics, electrochemistry, electronics, the EM spectrum etc up to undergrad level, stopping short of Maxwell's equations. Either that, or narrow the focus.&gt;

See, I was hoping to make more of a practical book about electronics and about the subject. Now it seems this book has become practically everything but? Hoped to cover things like design and understanding of electrical circuits and systems, etc. Your thoughts?

&lt;Narrow the focus. There's a proposed physics with calculus that can cover the wider shores of EM. For this book, just stick to circuits; without much maths in the first half, with maths in the expanded section: resistance, capacitance, inductance, batteries and electrolysis, generators and motors, and semiconductors. Don't explain how semiconductors work, or details about magnetism; stick to what's need for studying circuits. Possibly a final chapter saying, without maths, 'This is how circuits fit into EM and beyond. Now go and read these other books'&gt;

I agree with person. If we concentrate more on the field of ELECTRONICS and less on the field of ELECTRICITY, we should fare well with a good textbook. If a reader can design a radio transmitter or digital circuit by the end of the book, we can give our selves a pat on the back. However, learning how electron spin and the function of n-doped semiconductor materials only gets you so far.

&lt;More focused list of chapters below, based on list for basic edition. Can always subdivide chapters later.&gt;

Quote &quot;Semiconductor are always made of silicon&quot;
:No semiconductors can be made of Gallium Arsenide or any group 3 and group 5 compound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The concept of a fully autonomous, mission capable, legged robot has for years been a Holy Grail of roboticists. Development of such machines has been hampered by actuators and power technology and control schemes that cannot hope to compete with even some of the “simplest” systems found in the natural world.

=== Biomimetics ===

Faced with such a daunting task, it is not surprising that more and more researchers are beginning to look toward biological mechanisms for inspiration.

Biology provides a wealth of inspiration for robot design.
There are millions of species of animals that have evolved efficient solutions to locomotion and locomotion control.

=== Legs, wheels, treads ===

Insects in particular are well known not only for their speed and agility but also for their ability to traverse some of the most difficult terrains imaginable; insects can be found navigating rocky ground, walking upside down, climbing vertical surfaces, or even walking on water.
Furthermore, insects almost instantly respond to injury or removal of legs by altering stance and stepping pattern to maintain efficient locomotion with a reduced number of legs [1].
Given the ultimate goal of autonomy, this ability to reconfigure locomotion strategies will be crucial to the robustness of autonomous robots [2].

There are of course other mechanisms capable of producing locomotion, most notably wheels and caterpillar treads.
While these devices are admittedly much easier to design and implement, they carry with them a set of disadvantages that inhibits their use in military or exploratory applications.
Primary amongst these limitations is the simple fact that wheels, and to a lesser extent treads, are not capable of traversing terrain nearly as complex as that which a legged vehicle is capable of maneuvering over [2].
Even wheeled and tracked vehicles designed specifically for harsh terrains cannot maneuver over an obstacle significantly shorter than the vehicle itself; a legged vehicle on the other hand could be expected to climb an obstacle up to twice its own height, much like a cockroach can.
This limitation on mobility alone means that in any environment without fairly flat, continuous terrain, a walking vehicle is far preferable to a wheeled or tracked one.
Legged vehicles are also inherently more robust than those dependent on wheels or tracks.
The loss of a single leg on a hexapod will result in only minimal loss in maneuverability; on a wheeled vehicle a damaged wheel could spell the end of mobility, and a damaged caterpillar tread almost always results in catastrophic failure.
Finally, legged vehicles are far more capable of navigating an intermittent substrate—such as a slatted surface—than wheeled vehicles [3].

Given the preceding argument for the use of legged locomotion in certain environments, one is left with the daunting task of actually designing an efficient legged robot.
While such a task is difficult to say the least, nature has provided us—literally—with a world full of templates.
Animals can be found that are capable of navigation over almost any surface, and it is from these natural solutions to locomotion problems that engineers are more and more often seeking inspiration.

=== Actuators ===

2. Actuator Selection The selection of actuators plays a pivotal role in any mobile robot design, as the shape, size, weight and strength of an actuator must all be taken into account, and the power source of the actuators often provides the greatest constraint on a robot’s potential abilities.

==== Muscle ====

Biological organisms have a great advantage over mechanical systems in that muscle, nature’s actuator of choice, has a favorable force-to-weight ratio and requires low levels of activation energy.
Their tunable passive stiffness properties are 
also well suited for energy efficient legged locomotion.
The most frequently used actuators, electric motors and pneumatic/hydraulic cylinders, are far from equivalent to their biological counterparts.

==== Electric motor ====

Electric motors are probably the most commonly used actuation and control devices in modern day robotics, and with good reason.
Motors in a wide range of sizes are readily available and they are very easy to control.
These devices are also fairly easy to implement, normally requiring just a few electrical connections. However, electric motors have several disadvantages.
Most importantly, their force-to-weight ratio is far lower than that of pneumatic and hydraulic devices, and in a field such as legged robotics, where weight is of the utmost importance, this makes them unsuitable for many applications.
Typically, electric systems have a power to weight ratio of 50-100 W/kg (including only motor and gear reducer, operating at rated power), whereas fluid systems produce 100-200 W/kg (including actuator and valve weights) [4] and biological muscle, which varies widely in properties, produces anywhere from 40-250 W/kg [5].
In addition, when trying to take advantage of an animal’s efficient [[wiktionary: biomechanical| biomechanical]] design, the drastic difference between the rotary motion of most electric motors and the linear motion of muscle can cause complications.

==== Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinder ====

Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinder systems eliminate some of the problems associated with electric motors [6].
As a general rule, they provide a significantly higher force-to-weight ratio than motors; an advantage that in itself often leads to their use, even given the increased complexity and weight of control valves and pressurized fluid lines required for operation.
These actuators also produce linear motion, which makes them more suitable to serving a role equivalent to muscle.
Unfortunately, air cylinders are better suited to “bang-bang” operation; that is, motion from one extreme to another with mechanical stops to halt motion.
Smooth walking motion requires a much larger range of states, and the [[wikipedia: stiction| stiction]] present in most pressure cylinders makes even coarse position control difficult.
Fluid pressure devices are still quite massive; for example, almost seventy-five percent of CWRU’s Robot III’s weight is composed of its actuators and valves [7].

==== Braided pneumatic actuator ====

Braided pneumatic actuators (BPAs) provide a number of advantages over conventional actuation devices, and share some important characteristics with biological muscle.
These devices consist of two major components: an inflatable bladder around which is wrapped an expandable fiber mesh (Figure 1).
The resulting actuator is significantly lighter than a standard air cylinder; however, the braided pneumatic actuator is actually capable of producing greater forces (and thus possesses a much higher force-to weight-ratio) than its heavier counterpart.
When the bladder is filled with pressurized air, its volume tends to increase. Because of the constant length of the mesh fibers, this can only be accomplished by the actuator expanding radially while simultaneously contracting along its axis.
The result is a muscle-like contraction that produces a force-length curve akin to the rising phase of actual muscle [8].

An important property of BPA to note is that at maximum contraction (L/Lo≈0.69) the actuator is incapable of producing force; conversely, the maximum possible force is produced when the actuator is fully extended. Therefore, similar to muscle, the force output of these actuators is self-limited by nature.
While an electric motor controller could conceivably become unstable and drive a system until failure of either the structure or the motor, a braided pneumatic actuator driven by an unstable controller is less likely to be driven to the point of damaging itself or the surrounding structure.
Because of this property, braided pneumatic actuators are well suited for the implementation of positive load feedback, which is known to be used by animals including cockroaches, cats and humans [9].

BPAs are also known as McKibben artificial muscles [10], air muscles, and rubbertuators.
They were patented in 1957 by Gaylord and used by McKibben in orthotic devices [11].
Like biological muscle, BPAs are pull-only devices. This means that they must be used in opposing pairs, or opposing some other antagonist.
This property is of significant importance for useful application of these devices, for although it requires the use of two actuators or sets of actuators at each joint, it allows the muscle-like property of co-contraction, also known as stiffness control.
If one considers a joint in the human body, such as the elbow or knee, it should be obvious that whatever

 Figure 1: A placeholder
 
position the joint is in the muscles that control that joint can be activated (flexed) without changing the joint angle.
From an engineering standpoint, this is accomplished by increasing the force produced by each muscle in such a way that the net moment produced at the joint is zero.
As a result, the joint angle remains the same but perturbations, such as the application of an outside force, result in less disturbance.
From a practical standpoint, this means that the joint can be varied through a continuum of positions and compliances independently.
The resulting joint can be stiff when needed, such as when bearing weight while walking, or compliant, as in cases of heel strike where compensation for uneven terrain may be needed.

The greatest impediment to widespread use of BPAs has been their relatively short fatigue life.
Under operating conditions such as we desire, these devices are capable of a service life on the order of 10,000 cycles as they were originally designed.
A significant improvement to these devices has been made by the Festo Corporation, which has recently introduced a new product called fluidic muscle.
This operates on the same principles as a standard BPA, with the critical difference being that the fiber mesh is impregnated inside the expandable bladder. The resulting actuators have a demonstrated fatigue life on the order of 10,000,000 cycles at high pressure. 

3. Previous Robots

Two previous robots developed at CWRU have provided significant insight and impetus for the design of Robot V.
Both of these cockroach-based robots are non-autonomous, and rely on off board controllers and power supplies for operation.

Robot III was the first pneumatically powered robot built at CWRU, and relied on conventional pneumatic cylinders for actuation.
This 15 kilogram robot was powerful, and was demonstrated to be capable of easily lifting payloads equivalent to its own weight.
The fundamental failing of this robot was the difficulty inherent in the control of the pneumatic cylinders; although capable of maintaining stance robustly and cycling its legs in a cockroach manner, to date this robot has not demonstrated smooth locomotion [12].

Kinematically similar to its predecessor, Robot IV implemented braided pneumatic actuators in place of Robot III’s pneumatic cylinders.
This robot was underpowered; it was barely able to lift itself, the valves were moved off-board for walking experiments.
However, this robot was significantly easier to control, in large part because the valves allowed air to be trapped inside the actuators, so that joint stiffness could be varied as well as joint position.
Using an open-loop controller, this robot was able to locomote [13]

4. Overview of Robot V

Design Case Western Reserve University’s most recent robot, Robot V (Ajax) like its predecessors Robot IV and Robot III is based on the death head cockroach ''Blaberus discoidalis''.
Although it is not feasible to capture the full range of motion exhibited by the insect—up to seven degrees of freedom per leg—analysis of leg motion during locomotion suggests that this is not necessary.
This is because in many cases joints demonstrate only a small range of motion, while the majority of a leg’s movement is produced by a few joints.
We have determined that three joints in the rear legs, four in the middle legs, and five in the front legs are sufficient to produce reasonable and robust walking [7] [14].
The different number of DOF in each set of limbs represents the task-oriented nature of each pair of legs.
On the insect, the front legs are relatively small and weak, but highly dexterous (Figure 2), and are thus able to effectively manipulate objects or navigate difficult terrain.
This dexterity is attained in the robot through three joints between the body and coxa.
These joints are referred to (from most proximal to most distal) as
γ, with an axis parallel to the intersection of the median and coronal planes (in the z direction);
β, with an axis parallel to the median and transverse planes (in the y direction); and
α, with

Figure 2: Schematic of front leg with axes of joint rotation

an axis parallel to the coronal and transverse planes (in the x direction).
The two remaining joints are between the coxa and femur and the femur and tibia.
The middle legs on the insect play an important role in weight support, and are critical for turning and climbing (rearing) functions; however they sacrifice some dexterity for power.
On Robot V, the middle legs have only two degrees of freedom—α and β—between the body and coxa, and retain the single joint between the coxa and femur and the femur and tibia.
Finally, the cockroach uses its rear legs primarily for locomotion, and although these limbs are not as agile as the others, they are larger and much more powerful; likewise, the rear legs of the robot have only one joint between each of the segments.
The body-coxa joint uses of only the β joint.
Although each leg has a unique design, one component they have in common is the tarsus, or foot, construction. This consists of a compliant member attached to the end of the tibia and a pair of claws.
The compliant element is capable of bending to maintain contact with the ground, thus providing traction.
The claws are angled differently on each leg to assist in its specific task; for example, the claws on the rear leg are angled backwards like spines, allowing the foot additional traction when propelling the robot forward.

4.1 Valves

Each joint is driven by two opposing sets of actuators, allowing for controlled motion in both directions (previous robots have used a single actuator set paired with a spring) [15].
Each actuator set is driven by two two-way valves; one for air inlet and one for air exhaust.
This scheme doubles the number, and thus the weight, of valves as compared to Robot III; however, it allows for the implementation of stiffness control, or co-contraction.
Because the pressures in opposing actuators can be independently varied, the same joint angle can be achieved using different combinations of actuator pressures; all that is required is that the moments on a given joint sum to zero at the desired position.
As a result, a joint can be made very stiff by pressurizing both sets of actuators, or very compliant, by pressurizing one actuator only enough to overcome the mass properties of the limb to reach a desired position.

4.2 Stance bias

The actuators [[wiktionary: onboard| onboard]] a legged robot can generally be subdivided into two classes:
those used to move the limb through the swing phase and
those required to maintain stance and generate locomotion.
One of the fundamental differences between these two types of actuators is the load that is required of them.
The swing actuators need only provide the force necessary to overcome the weight and inertia of the limb, whereas the stance actuators must support not only a significant portion of the entire mass of the robot, but also provide the force necessary for locomotion.
This disparity between operational demands can potentially lead to large, powerful stance actuators and small swing actuators (as can be seen in the human body with powerful quadriceps muscles which maintain stance, and the respectively weaker hamstring muscles, which are used for swing);
however, because of limited options for robot actuator sizes, it is more often the case that the swing actuators are overpowered, whereas the stance actuators are either underpowered or just capable of meeting the demands placed on them.
On Robot V this problem was resolved through the placement of torsion springs at some critical load bearing joints (specifically the coxa-femur and β joints) to provide a bias in the direction of stance.
As a result, the forces required of the stance actuators are significantly reduced while the swing actuators must produce greater forces, but still remain within their operational range.

5. Initial Trials

Robot V, like Robot IV, was designed as an exoskeleton, where the structural members are placed outside and around the actuators.
Not only did this allow a significant reduction in weight, but it also provided a limited protection for the actuators, which are susceptible to puncture and abrasion (Figure 3).
The vast majority of the structural elements were made of 6061-T6 Aluminum, although axles and actuator mounting shafts were made of 1018 steel, and fasteners were made from stainless steel. All joint axles were mounted in nylon journal bearings. 

 Figure 3: Robot V (Ajax) 

Whenever possible, actuators were directly mounted to both their insertion and their origin.
This precluded the need for tendons, allowing the maximum possible length of actuator to be used.
This in turn maximized the force and stroke available for each individual joint.
The notable exception to this strategy was the β actuators, which were attached to a tendon and mounted parallel to the body.
This was done to reduce the overall height of the robot.
The first legs to be built were the middle legs.
These were chosen for initial tests because they must be dexterous and forceful to maintain stance in a tripod gait.
After completion of the first leg the range of motion (ROM) of each of its joints was measured and compared to the design values. These data are summarized below:

Joint ROM Desired ROM β 20° 30° α 25 40 c-f (coxa-femur) 40 50 f-t (femur-tibia) 75 75

These tests were performed at both 5.5 and 6.25 bar, with no significant difference between the results of the two, suggesting that at these pressures the actuators had reached their full contraction.
Although the desired ROMs were not reached, the measured ROMs are in excess of those demonstrated by animal.
The demonstrated ROM’s of the leg were deemed sufficient for walking and climbing.
A gantry was constructed to support the middle legs for preliminary stance and motion tests.
With only horizontal support—to prevent tipping—the legs were able to maintain stance while supporting their weight (three kilos) plus the weight of the valves for the actuators (one half kilo) and a gantry element (one kilo) without any pressurized air in the actuators.
This capability, a result of the aforementioned stance bias, clearly demonstrates the ability of these legs to support not only the weight of the robot, but a significant payload as well. An open loop controller was then used to cycle the legs through “push-ups”; raising themselves from a minimum to a maximum height.
In this fashion, the legs were able to lift the body approximately 6 cm.
This process was repeated with additional payloads (beyond valve and gantry weight) of two and a half and five kilograms using 6 bar air.
In both cases, the legs were able to attain the same height.

6. Ajax

Fully assembled—including valves—Robot V weighs 15 kilograms.
Range of motion tests have been performed for all joints, and are summarized below.
In many cases, specifically the femur-tibia joints of all legs, these ranges of motion are in excess of the desired ROM.
In all cases, they are sufficient for walking and climbing.

JOINT ROM Front Leg γ 35° β 45 α 25 c-f 40 f-t 75 Middle Leg β 20 α 25 c-f 40 f-t 75 Rear Leg β 25 c-f 50 f-t 80

Ajax demonstrates a propensity to stand due to the preloads placed on the torsion springs; even without pressure in the actuators, the middle and rear

Figure 4: Robot V without activated actuators (top) and standing (bottom). Note that even when the actuators are un-pressurized, they maintain a near-stance position, with only the feet contacting the surface.

Legs maintain a near-stance position.
Initial tests of the robot have shown that it is capable of supporting its weight in a standing position and of achieving stance both unloaded and with a five kilogram payload (Figure 4).

Further tests have shown that the robot is able to achieve a tripod stance and alternate between tripods, which is important for walking.
These tasks were achieved using a simple open loop controller.
Furthermore, the passive properties of the BPA’s are clearly highlighted in the robot’s ability to return to its desired position after suffering perturbations without the use of any form of active posture control.
Using a feed forward controller with absolutely no feedback, the robot can produce reasonable forward locomotion.
Although this is by no means the robust, agile walking that is the ultimate goal of this project, it is a clear demonstration of not only the robot’s capabilities, but also the advantages offered by the BPA’s.
The ability to move using only an open loop controller is in large part a result of the passive properties of the actuators, which provide compensation for any instabilities in the controller itself and immediate response to perturbations without the need for controller intervention.

This can be contrasted with Robot III, which, even with kinematic and force feedback, was not able to walk.
This failure of Robot III is attributed to the inability of both the pneumatic cylinders and posture controller to deal with the sudden changes in load associated with locomotion.

In short, the BPA’s act as filters, providing immediate response to perturbation; a task the controller is incapable of.
This same process occurs in biological muscle, which responds nearly instantaneously to perturbation, but only slowly to neurological input [16].
With the addition of a biologically inspired closed loop controller in the future, Ajax is expected to display robust, insect-like locomotion.

7. Future Work

Although the mechanical aspects of this robot have been completed, the control system is still in its infancy.
Because the mechanics of a system are inextricably linked to its control circuits, Ajax’s controller is expected to benefit from the close relationship between its design and that of the actual insect.
This relationship is perhaps most prominent in the muscle-like nature of the braided pneumatic actuators.

Sensors will be added to provide not only joint position feedback, but force feedback as well.
Joint angle can easily be determined with a potentiometer, as has been done on our previous robots.
Force feedback will be attained through pressure measurements from the actuators, which, given actuator length, can be used to determine actuator force.
Although strain gauges properly placed on the mounting elements of the actuators can produce sufficient force feedback, previous work has shown many desirable characteristics inherent in pressure transducers: they have much cleaner signals, do not require amplifiers, and do not exhibit cross talk; all disadvantages of strain gauges.
In addition, strain gauges must be mounted directly adjacent to the actuator they are recording from; this requires more weight at distal points of the limb, (thusly increasing the moment of inertia of the limb) and generally reduces the usable available stroke of the actuator.
We have demonstrated that a pressure transducer located down-line from an actuator produces a sufficient signal to determine actuator force.

An insect-inspired controller was developed for Robot III, and this will be modified for use on Robot V.
It is a distributed hierarchical control system.
The local to central progression includes circuits that control joint position and stiffness, inter-leg coordination and reflexes, intra-leg gait coordination, and body motion.
The inter-leg coordination circuit solves the inverse kinematics problem for the legs and the centralized posture control system solves the force distribution problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Aside from the physical shape of the guitar body, strings are the most important thing for determining the sound of a guitar. New strings sound bright and full, while old strings tend to sound dull and dead. Many guitarists believe that strings should be changed regularly, not just when they break. This is because sweat and dirt corrode the strings, and over time this degrades their sound quality.  Other guitarists believe that new strings sound much worse than old ones, feeling that a string's tonal quality only improves over time.  Individual string quality may vary drastically from string to string.

When one breaks a string, all of the strings should be changed at once. This is especially true if the newer string is of a different brand or gauge. The string's manufacturing process, thickness and age all affect its tone, and one new string being played with a bunch of old strings can make your guitar sound strange. Players should be advised that guitars are usually set up for a particular gauge of string. The guitar will still function fine with a different gauge of strings, however for optimal sound, the guitar may need to be adjusted. See the chapter on [[../Adjusting the Guitar|adjusting the guitar]] for more details.

Because there are several different types of guitar, and each type is designed differently, each type has its own method of stringing. The type of strings you use mostly depends on what style of music you play and how long you've been playing. Thinner strings are generally preferred by beginners, but many experienced players prefer the feel of thin strings over thicker strings. Please see the [[../Guitar Accessories|guitar accessories]] section for details on different types of strings.

The first thing you always need to do when stringing a guitar is to take off the old strings. You should ''never'' just cut the strings of a tuned guitar in half, because the sudden release of tension on the neck can damage the guitar. Instead, always turn the tuning pegs to decrease tension, until the string is so loose that it doesn't produce a note when struck, then cut or unwind them. In most cases, the string is bent at the end where it was inserted, to insure that it would stay during tuning. Unbend the string, then pull it out of the peg hole. If the peg end of the string is too bent or curled from the winding, cut the string on a straight part of the string. This will make it easier to remove the string from the hole at the other end and reduce the risk of scratching the body or the bridge while trying to get it out. Slide the string out of the bridge at the bottom end of the guitar. Some people string one at a time to make sure the neck sustains tension, or they just take all of the strings off at the same time.

==Stringing Acoustics==
Standard guitars typically have a ball-head peg at the bridge section. This peg has a hollow shaft, with a groove that allows the string to come out from the peg.

Typically, the process is as follows:

Unwinding the string
#Pick one of the strings, usually either the first or sixth string, and begin loosening it. If you have a string winder, put the rectangular box over the tuning peg and unwind the string. 

#Once the string is loose enough, pull the peg out of the bridge. If you have a string winder, it will have a notch that can fit underneath the head to pull it out.

Attaching the string
#The guitar string should have a ball (or cylinder) end. Put that into the bridge hole.
#Push the ball-head peg back in. as you do, pull on the string so that the peg can hold the string tightly on the bridge end.
#Find the hole on the winder, and place the string through it, leaving about 5cm out on the other side. For the thicker strings, it is recommended to bend it a bit. 
#Use one hand to hold the string so that the section between this hand and the peg is tight. Wind one wound.
#Check the tightness again, and try to divert the string so that it wind UNDERNEATH the winder hole. Then wind it until you have the string encircle the machine head two to three times.
#Tune from here.

===Twelve String Acoustic===
It has the same principle to the sixth string. But every two strings were tuned with the same sound, one octave apart. *(RDT)

===Classical Guitar===

To unstring a classical guitar one method is:
#Loosen the string by turning the tuning peg
#Then at the bridge push the string back into the hole a little, this will loosen the &quot;knot&quot; enough to unknot and pull the string out of the hole.
#Then feed the string around the peg loop by loop until the last hoop which is inserted through the hole in the peg is available, push the string out of the loop, then pull the loop out of the hole.

To string a classical guitar one method is reverse of the unstringing
#Bend about an inch of string at one end to form an open loop, push that through the peg hole, wrap the other end of the string around the peg and through the loop, then pass it down the guitar body to the bridge and into the hole there.
#Loop back to the neck (about two or three inches) and twist back around the string, then you can put two or three twists in which should end up on top of the bridge, pull the string from the middle of the guitar to draw the twists taut.
#Then wind the peg to tighten the string. You should take it easy when tuning up for the first time to give the string time to &quot;settle in&quot;, you may also find that the string may go out of tune easily for a day or two as it beds in.

==Stringing Electrics==

For the 6th string (the low E), take the string out of the package and insert the end through the bridge of the guitar. Pull it all the way through until the ball at the end of the string stops it from being pulled further. This is optional: Make a kink in the string to insure that it will not slip away from the turning of the peg, (usually about one or two inches from the peg). Wind the string around halfway and insert the end through the hole. Pull the string to add tension, so the string will  stay around the peg during tuning. Turn the tuning peg to increase tension until the string is around the desired pitch, to make certain it will stay on properly. Check that the string is in the notch in the nut and the bridge, if it is not, decrease tension on the string until you can move it into the notch, tune it back up. Do this for the rest of your strings and you are done!

Another method:  

String the low E and other strings as mentioned.  Align the tuning peg's hole with the direction of the string and slip it through the peg in the direction of the headstock.  Facing the guitar with the headstock to your right, pull the string taut with your left hand.

With your opposite thumb and forefinger, twist the string in an &quot;s&quot; at the twelfth fret so that it touches both sides of the twelfth fret.  You will have to let some of the string out to do this.  This method tells you the optimum length of the string to wind around the tuning peg.

Hold the string with your right hand below the tuning peg so that the pointy end is sticking out the other side.  Slowly tighten the peg so that the string is winding on the INSIDE of the headstock -- inside right for E A D, and inside left for G B E.  Allow the string to wind once underneath itself, and then wrap it over top of itself the rest of the way.  Make sure you hold tight as you go so that there is little slippage later.

If possible, hold the string with your right thumb and middle finger while regulating the pressure on the string with your right index finger.

===Tips===

*Note that taking off all strings at once is not recommended if you have:
#a floating tremolo system (e.g. Floyd Rose II), which can be difficult to get the tremolo angle back to the right level when restrung;
#a bridge which is not fixed (one that will just fall off when the strings are removed)

*Try not to bend the string in the same place excessively otherwise the string will break at the bend

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Memory management|Complex types}}

A '''string''' in C is merely an array of characters. The length of a string is determined by a terminating null character: &lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt;. So, a string with the contents, say, &lt;code&gt;&quot;abc&quot;&lt;/code&gt; has four characters: &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'c'&lt;/code&gt;, and the terminating null character.

The terminating null character has the value zero.

== Syntax ==
In C, string constants (literals) are surrounded by double quotes (&lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;), e.g. &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hello world!&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; and are compiled to an array of the specified &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; values with an additional null terminating character (0-valued) code to mark the end of the string. The type of a string constant is &lt;tt&gt;char []&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== backslash escapes ===

String literals may not directly in the source code contain embedded newlines or other control characters, or some other characters of special meaning in string.

To include such characters in a string, the backslash escapes may be used, like this:
{|
! align=&quot;left&quot; |Escape
! align=&quot;left&quot; |Meaning
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\\&lt;/tt&gt; || Literal backslash
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; || Double quote
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\'&lt;/tt&gt; || Single quote
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; || Newline (line feed)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\r&lt;/tt&gt; || Carriage return
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\b&lt;/tt&gt; || Backspace
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; || Horizontal tab
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\f&lt;/tt&gt; || Form feed
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\a&lt;/tt&gt; || Alert (bell)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\v&lt;/tt&gt; || Vertical tab
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\?&lt;/tt&gt; || Question mark (used to escape [[../C trigraph/|trigraphs]])
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;''nnn'' || Character with octal value ''nnn''
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;\x&lt;/tt&gt;''hh'' || Character with hexadecimal value ''hh''
|}

===Wide character strings===
C supports wide character strings, defined as arrays of the type &lt;tt&gt;wchar_t&lt;/tt&gt;, 16-bit (at least) values. They are written with an L before the string like this
:&lt;tt&gt;wchar_t *p = L&quot;Hello&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;world!&quot;;&lt;/tt&gt;
This feature allows strings where more than 256 different possible characters are needed (although also variable length &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; strings can be used). They end with a zero-valued &lt;tt&gt;wchar_t&lt;/tt&gt;. These strings are not supported by the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; functions. Instead they have their own functions, declared in &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;wchar.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Character encodings===
What character encoding the &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;wchar_t&lt;/tt&gt; represent is not specified by the C standard, except that the value 0x00 and 0x0000 specify the end of the string and not a character. It the input and output code which are directly affected by the character encoding. Other code should not be too affected. The editor should also be able to handle the encoding if strings shall be able to written in the source code.

There are three major types of encodings:
*One byte per character. Normally based on ASCII. There is a limit of 255 different characters plus the zero termination character.
*Variable length &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; strings, which allows many more than 255 different characters. Such strings are written as normal &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;-based arrays. These encodings are normally ASCII-based and examples are [[UTF-8]] or [[Shift JIS]].
*Wide character strings. They are arrays of &lt;tt&gt;wchar_t&lt;/tt&gt; values. [[UTF-16]] is the most common such encoding, and it is also variable-length, meaning that a character can be two &lt;tt&gt;wchar_t&lt;/tt&gt;.

== The &lt;code&gt;&lt;string.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Standard Header ==

Because programmers find raw strings cumbersome to deal with, they wrote the code in the &lt;code&gt;&lt;string.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; library. It represents not a concerted design effort but rather the accretion of contributions made by various authors over a span of years.

First, three types of functions exist in the string library:

* the &lt;code&gt;mem&lt;/code&gt; functions manipulate sequences of arbitrary characters without regard to the null character;
* the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; functions manipulate null-terminated sequences of characters;
* the &lt;code&gt;strn&lt;/code&gt; functions manipulate sequences of non-null characters.

=== The more commonly-used string functions ===

The nine most commonly used functions in the string library are:

* &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt; - concatenate two strings
* &lt;code&gt;strchr&lt;/code&gt; - string scanning operation
* &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; - compare two strings
* &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt; - copy a string
* &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; - get string length
* &lt;code&gt;strncat&lt;/code&gt; - concatenate one string with part of another
* &lt;code&gt;strncmp&lt;/code&gt; - compare parts of two strings
* &lt;code&gt;strncpy&lt;/code&gt; - copy part of a string
* &lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt; - string scanning operation

==== The &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;char *strcat(char * restrict s1, const char * restrict s2);&lt;/code&gt;

''Some people recommend using'' &lt;code&gt;strncat()&lt;/code&gt; ''or'' &lt;code&gt;strlcat()&lt;/code&gt; ''instead of strcat, in order to avoid buffer overflow.''

The &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt; function shall append a copy of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; (including the terminating null byte) to the end of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. The initial byte of &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; overwrites the null byte at the end of &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;.

This function is used to attach one string to the end of another string. It is imperative that the first string (&lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;) have the space needed to store both strings.

Example:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    ...
    static const char *colors[] = {&quot;Red&quot;,&quot;Orange&quot;,&quot;Yellow&quot;,&quot;Green&quot;,&quot;Blue&quot;,&quot;Purple&quot; };
    static const char *widths[] = {&quot;Thin&quot;,&quot;Medium&quot;,&quot;Thick&quot;,&quot;Bold&quot; };
    ...
    char penText[20];
    ...
    int penColor = 3, penThickness = 2;
    strcpy(penText, colors[penColor]);
    strcat(penText, widths[penThickness]);
    printf(&quot;My pen is %s\n&quot;, penText); // prints 'My pen is GreenThick'
&lt;/source&gt;

Before calling &lt;code&gt;strcat()&lt;/code&gt;, the destination must currently contain a null terminated string or the first character must have been initialized with the null character (e.g. &lt;code&gt;penText[0] = '\0';&lt;/code&gt;).


The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strcat */
 char *(strcat)(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2)
 {
     char *s = s1;
     /* Move s so that it points to the end of s1.  */
     while (*s != '\0')
         s++;
     /* Copy the contents of s2 into the space at the end of s1.  */
     strcpy(s, s2);
     return s1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strchr&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;char *strchr(const char *s, int c);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strchr()&lt;/code&gt; function shall locate the first occurrence of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (converted to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;) in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. The terminating null byte is considered to be part of the string. The function returns the location of the found character, or a null pointer if the character was not found.

This function is used to find certain characters in strings.

At one point in history, this function was named &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;strchr&lt;/code&gt; name, however cryptic, fits the general pattern for naming.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strchr&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strchr */
 char *(strchr)(const char *s, int c)
 {
     /* Scan s for the character.  When this loop is finished,
        s will either point to the end of the string or the
        character we were looking for.  */
     while (*s != '\0' &amp;&amp; *s != (char)c)
         s++;
     return ( (*s == (char)c) ? (char *) s : NULL );
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);&lt;/code&gt;

A rudimentary form of string comparison is done with the strcmp() function. It takes two strings as arguments and returns a value less than zero if the first is lexographically less than the second, a value greater than zero if the first is lexographically greater than the second, or zero if the two strings are equal. The comparison is done by comparing the coded (ascii) value of the chararacters, character by character.

This simple type of string comparison is nowadays generally considered unacceptable when sorting lists of strings.
More advanced algorithms exist that are capable of producing lists in dictionary sorted order. They can also fix problems such as strcmp() considering the string &quot;Alpha2&quot; greater than &quot;Alpha12&quot;. (In the previous example, &quot;Alpha2&quot; compares greater than &quot;Alpha12&quot; because '2' comes after '1' in the character set.) What we're saying is, don't use this &lt;code&gt;strcmp()&lt;/code&gt; alone for general string sorting in any commercial or professional code.

The &lt;code&gt;strcmp()&lt;/code&gt; function shall compare the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; to the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;.  The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both interpreted as type &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) that differ in the strings being compared. Upon completion, &lt;code&gt;strcmp()&lt;/code&gt; shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; is greater than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.

Since comparing pointers by themselves is not practically useful unless one is comparing pointers within the same array, this function lexically compares the strings that two pointers point to.

This function is useful in comparisons, e.g.

 if (strcmp(s, &quot;whatever&quot;) == 0) /* do something */
     ;

The collating sequence used by &lt;code&gt;strcmp()&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to the machine's native character set. The only guarantee about the order is that the digits from &lt;tt&gt;'0'&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;'9'&lt;/tt&gt; are in consecutive order.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strcmp */
 int (strcmp)(const char *s1, const char *s2)
 {
     unsigned char uc1, uc2;
     /* Move s1 and s2 to the first differing characters 
        in each string, or the ends of the strings if they
        are identical.  */
     while (*s1 != '\0' &amp;&amp; *s1 == *s2) {
         s1++;
         s2++;
     }
     /* Compare the characters as unsigned char and
        return the difference.  */
     uc1 = (*(unsigned char *) s1);
     uc2 = (*(unsigned char *) s2);
     return ((uc1 &lt; uc2) ? -1 : (uc1 &gt; uc2));
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;char *strcpy(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2);&lt;/code&gt;

''Some people recommend always using'' &lt;code&gt;strncpy()&lt;/code&gt; ''instead of strcpy, to avoid buffer overflow.''

The &lt;code&gt;strcpy()&lt;/code&gt; function shall copy the C string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; (including the terminating null byte) into the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. There is no value used to indicate an error: if the arguments to &lt;code&gt;strcpy()&lt;/code&gt; are correct, and the destination buffer is large enough, the function will never fail.

Example:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    /* ... */
    static const char *penType=&quot;round&quot;;
    /* ... */
    char penText[20];
    /* ... */
    strcpy(penText, penType);
&lt;/source&gt;

Important: You must ensure that the destination buffer (&lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;) is able to contain all the characters in the source array, including the terminating null byte. Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;strcpy()&lt;/code&gt; will overwrite memory past the end of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow, which can cause the program to crash, or can be exploited by hackers to compromise the security of the computer.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strcpy */
 char *(strcpy)(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2)
 {
     char *dst = s1;
     const char *src = s2;
     /* Do the copying in a loop.  */
     while ((*dst++ = *src++) != '\0')
         ;               /* The body of this loop is left empty. */
     /* Return the destination string.  */
     return s1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;size_t strlen(const char *s);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strlen()&lt;/code&gt; function shall compute the number of bytes in the string to which &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; points, not including the terminating null byte.
It returns the number of bytes in the string. No value is used to indicate an error.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strlen */
 size_t (strlen)(const char *s)
 {
     const char *p = s;
     /* Loop over the data in s.  */
     while (*p != '\0')
         p++;
     return (size_t)(p - s);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strncat&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;char *strncat(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strncat()&lt;/code&gt; function shall append not more than &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes (a null byte and bytes that follow it are not appended) from the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. The initial byte of &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; overwrites the null byte at the end of &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. A terminating null byte is always appended to the result. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strncat&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strncat */
 char *(strncat)(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, size_t n)
 {
     char *s = s1;
     /* Loop over the data in s1.  */
     while (*s != '\0')
         s++;
     /* s now points to s1's trailing null character, now copy
        up to n bytes from s2 into s stopping if a null character
        is encountered in s2.
        It is not safe to use strncpy here since it copies EXACTLY n
        characters, NULL padding if necessary.  */
     while (n != 0 &amp;&amp; (*s = *s2++) != '\0') {
         n--;
         s++;
     }
     if (*s != '\0')
         *s = '\0';
     return s1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strncmp&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strncmp()&lt;/code&gt; function shall compare not more than &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes (bytes that follow a null byte are not compared) from the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; to the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;. The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both interpreted as type &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) that differ in the strings being compared. See &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; for an explanation of the return value.

This function is useful in comparisons, as the &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; function is.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strncmp&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strncmp */
 int (strncmp)(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n)
 {
     unsigned char uc1, uc2;
     /* Nothing to compare?  Return zero.  */
     if (n == 0)
         return 0;
     /* Loop, comparing bytes.  */
     while (n-- &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; *s1 == *s2) {
         /* If we've run out of bytes or hit a null, return zero
            since we already know *s1 == *s2.  */
         if (n == 0 || *s1 == '\0')
             return 0;
         s1++;
         s2++;
     }
     uc1 = (*(unsigned char *) s1);
     uc2 = (*(unsigned char *) s2);
     return ((uc1 &lt; uc2) ? -1 : (uc1 &gt; uc2));
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strncpy&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;char *strncpy(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strncpy()&lt;/code&gt; function shall copy not more than &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes (bytes that follow a null byte are not copied) from the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; to the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. If the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; is a string that is shorter than &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes, null bytes shall be appended to the copy in the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;, until &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes in all are written. The function shall return s1; no return value is reserved to indicate an error.

It is possible that the function will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; return a null-terminated string, which happens if the &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; string is longer than &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes.

The following is a public-domain version of &lt;code&gt;strncpy&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strncpy */
 char *(strncpy)(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict s2, size_t n)
 {
     char *dst = s1;
     const char *src = s2;
     /* Copy bytes, one at a time.  */
     while (n &gt; 0) {
         n--;
         if ((*dst++ = *src++) == '\0') {
             /* If we get here, we found a null character at the end
                of s2, so use memset to put null bytes at the end of
                s1.  */
             memset(dst, '\0', n);
             break;
         }
     }
     return s1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== The &lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt; function ====
&lt;code&gt;char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code&gt;strchr&lt;/code&gt;, except the string is searched right to left.

The &lt;code&gt;strrchr()&lt;/code&gt; function shall locate the last occurrence of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (converted to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;) in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. The terminating null byte is considered to be part of the string. Its return value is similar to &lt;code&gt;strchr&lt;/code&gt;'s return value.

At one point in history, this function was named &lt;code&gt;rindex&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt; name, however cryptic, fits the general pattern for naming.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strrchr&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strrchr */
 char *(strrchr)(const char *s, int c)
 {
     const char *last = NULL;
     /* If the character we're looking for is the terminating null,
        we just need to look for that character as there's only one
        of them in the string.  */
     if (c == '\0')
         return strchr(s, c);
     /* Loop through, finding the last match before hitting NULL.  */
     while ((s = strchr(s, c)) != NULL) {
         last = s;
         s++;
     }
     return (char *) last;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The less commonly-used string functions ===

The less-used functions are:

* &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; - Find a byte in memory
* &lt;code&gt;memcmp&lt;/code&gt; - Compare bytes in memory
* &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; - Copy bytes in memory
* &lt;code&gt;memmove&lt;/code&gt; - Copy bytes in memory with overlapping areas
* &lt;code&gt;memset&lt;/code&gt; - Set bytes in memory
* &lt;code&gt;strcoll&lt;/code&gt; - Compare bytes according to a locale-specific collating sequence
* &lt;code&gt;strcspn&lt;/code&gt; - Get the length of a complementary substring
* &lt;code&gt;strerror&lt;/code&gt; - Get error message
* &lt;code&gt;strpbrk&lt;/code&gt; - Scan a string for a byte
* &lt;code&gt;strspn&lt;/code&gt; - Get the length of a substring
* &lt;code&gt;strstr&lt;/code&gt; - Find a substring
* &lt;code&gt;strtok&lt;/code&gt; - Split a string into tokens
* &lt;code&gt;strxfrm&lt;/code&gt; - Transform string 

==== Copying functions ====

===== The &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;void *memcpy(void * restrict s1, const void * restrict s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;memcpy()&lt;/code&gt; function shall copy &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes from the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; into the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;.

Because the function does not have to worry about overlap, it can do the simplest copy it can.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* memcpy */
 void *(memcpy)(void * restrict s1, const void * restrict s2, size_t n)
 {
     char *dst = s1;
     const char *src = s2;
     /* Loop and copy.  */
     while (n-- != 0)
         *dst++ = *src++;
     return s1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===== The &lt;code&gt;memmove&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;void *memmove(void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;memmove()&lt;/code&gt; function shall copy &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes from the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; into the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. Copying takes place as if the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes from the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; are first copied into a temporary array of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes that does not overlap the objects pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, and then the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes from the temporary array are copied into the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. The function returns the value of &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;.

The easy way to implement this without using a temporary array is to check for a condition that would prevent an ascending copy, and if found, do a descending copy.

The following is a public-domain, though not completely portable, implementation of &lt;code&gt;memmove&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* memmove */
 void *(memmove)(void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n) 
 {
    /* note: these don't have to point to unsigned chars */
    char *p1 = s1;
    const char *p2 = s2;
    /* test for overlap that prevents an ascending copy */
    if (p2 &lt; p1 &amp;&amp; p1 &lt; p2 + n) {
        /* do a descending copy */
        p2 += n;
        p1 += n;
        while (n-- != 0) 
            *--p1 = *--p2;
    } else 
        while (n-- != 0) 
            *p1++ = *p2++;
    return s1; 
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Comparison functions ====

===== The &lt;code&gt;memcmp&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;memcmp()&lt;/code&gt; function shall compare the first &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes (each interpreted as &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) of the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; to the first &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes of the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;. The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both interpreted as type &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) that differ in the objects being compared.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;memcmp&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* memcmp */
 int (memcmp)(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n)
 {
     const unsigned char *us1 = (const unsigned char *) s1;
     const unsigned char *us2 = (const unsigned char *) s2;
     while (n-- != 0) {
         if (*us1 != *us2)
             return (*us1 &lt; *us2) ? -1 : +1;
         us1++;
         us2++;
     }
     return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===== The &lt;code&gt;strcoll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strxfrm&lt;/code&gt; functions =====
&lt;code&gt;int strcoll(const char *s1, const char *s2);&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;size_t strxfrm(char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The ANSI C Standard specifies two locale-specific comparison functions.

The &lt;code&gt;strcoll&lt;/code&gt; function compares the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; to the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, both interpreted as appropriate to the &lt;code&gt;LC_COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; category of the current locale. The return value is similar to &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;strxfrm&lt;/code&gt; function transforms the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; and places the resulting string into the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;. The transformation is such that if the &lt;code&gt;strcmp&lt;/code&gt; function is applied to the two transformed strings, it returns a value greater than, equal to, or less than zero, corresponding to the result of the &lt;code&gt;strcoll&lt;/code&gt; function applied to the same two original strings. No more than &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; characters are placed into the resulting array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;, including the terminating null character. If &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is zero, &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; is permitted to be a null pointer. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns the length of the transformed string.

These functions are rarely used and nontrivial to code, so there is no code for this section.

==== Search functions ====

===== The &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;memchr()&lt;/code&gt; function shall locate the first occurrence of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (converted to an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) in the initial &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes (each interpreted as &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) of the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is not found, &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; returns a null pointer.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* memchr */
 void *(memchr)(const void *s, int c, size_t n)
 {
     const unsigned char *src = s;
     unsigned char uc = c;
     while (n-- != 0) {
         if (*src == uc)
             return (void *) src;
         src++;
     }
     return NULL;
 }

&lt;/source&gt;

===== The &lt;code&gt;strcspn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strpbrk&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;strspn&lt;/code&gt; functions =====
&lt;code&gt;size_t strcspn(const char *s1, const char *s2);&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;char *strpbrk(const char *s1, const char *s2);&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;size_t strspn(const char *s1, const char *s2);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strcspn&lt;/code&gt; function computes the length of the maximum initial segment of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; which consists entirely of characters &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; from the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;strpbrk&lt;/code&gt; function locates the first occurrence in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; of any character from the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;, returning a pointer to that character or a null pointer if not found.

The &lt;code&gt;strspn&lt;/code&gt; function computes the length of the maximum initial segment of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; which consists entirely of characters from the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt;.

All of these functions are similar except in the test and the return value.

The following are public-domain implementations of &lt;code&gt;strcspn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strpbrk&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;strspn&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strcspn */
 size_t (strcspn)(const char *s1, const char *s2)
 {
     const char *sc1;
     for (sc1 = s1; *sc1 != '\0'; sc1++)
         if (strchr(s2, *sc1) != NULL)
             return (sc1 - s1);
     return sc1 - s1;            /* terminating nulls match */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strpbrk */
 char *(strpbrk)(const char *s1, const char *s2)
 {
     const char *sc1;
     for (sc1 = s1; *sc1 != '\0'; sc1++)
         if (strchr(s2, *sc1) != NULL)
             return (char *)sc1;
     return NULL;                /* terminating nulls match */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strspn */
 size_t (strspn)(const char *s1, const char *s2)
 {
     const char *sc1;
     for (sc1 = s1; *sc1 != '\0'; sc1++)
         if (strchr(s2, *sc1) == NULL)
             return (sc1 - s1);
     return sc1 - s1;            /* terminating nulls don't match */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===== The &lt;code&gt;strstr&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strstr()&lt;/code&gt; function shall locate the first occurrence in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;haystack&lt;/code&gt; of the sequence of bytes (excluding the terminating null byte) in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;needle&lt;/code&gt;. The function returns the pointer to the matching string in &lt;code&gt;haystack&lt;/code&gt; or a null pointer if a match is not found. If &lt;code&gt;needle&lt;/code&gt; is an empty string, the function returns &lt;code&gt;haystack&lt;/code&gt;.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;strstr&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strstr */
 char *(strstr)(const char *haystack, const char *needle)
 {
     size_t needlelen;
     /* Check for the null needle case.  */
     if (*needle == '\0')
         return (char *) haystack;
     needlelen = strlen(needle);
     for (; (haystack = strchr(haystack, *needle)) != NULL; haystack++)
         if (strncmp(haystack, needle, needlelen) == 0)
             return (char *) haystack;
     return NULL;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===== The &lt;code&gt;strtok&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;char *strtok(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict delimiters);&lt;/code&gt;

A sequence of calls to &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt; breaks the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a byte from the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;delimiters&lt;/code&gt;. The first call in the sequence has &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; as its first argument, and is followed by calls with a null pointer as their first argument. The separator string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;delimiters&lt;/code&gt; may be different from call to call.

The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; for the first byte that is not contained in the current separator string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;delimiters&lt;/code&gt;. If no such byte is found, then there are no tokens in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt; shall return a null pointer. If such a byte is found, it is the start of the first token.

The &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt; function then searches from there for a byte (or multiple, consecutive bytes) that is contained in the current separator string. If no such byte is found, the current token extends to the end of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt;, and subsequent searches for a token shall return a null pointer. If such a byte is found, it is overwritten by a null byte, which terminates the current token. The &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt; function saves a pointer to the following byte, from which the next search for a token shall start.

Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the first argument, starts searching from the saved pointer and behaves as described above.

The &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt; function need not be reentrant. A function that is not required to be reentrant is not required to be thread-safe.

Because the &lt;code&gt;strtok()&lt;/code&gt; function must save state between calls, and you could not have two tokenizers going at the same time, the Single Unix Standard defined a similar function, &lt;code&gt;strtok_r()&lt;/code&gt;, that does not need to save state. Its prototype is this:

&lt;code&gt;char *strtok_r(char *s, const char *delimiters, char **lasts);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;strtok_r()&lt;/code&gt; function considers the null-terminated string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; as a sequence of zero or more text tokens separated by spans of one or more characters from the separator string &lt;code&gt;delimiters&lt;/code&gt;. The argument lasts points to a user-provided pointer which points to stored information necessary for &lt;code&gt;strtok_r()&lt;/code&gt; to continue scanning the same string.

In the first call to &lt;code&gt;strtok_r()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; points to a null-terminated string, &lt;code&gt;delimiters&lt;/code&gt; to a null-terminated string of separator characters, and the value pointed to by &lt;code&gt;lasts&lt;/code&gt; is ignored. The &lt;code&gt;strtok_r()&lt;/code&gt; function shall return a pointer to the first character of the first token, write a null character into &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; immediately following the returned token, and update the pointer to which &lt;code&gt;lasts&lt;/code&gt; points.

In subsequent calls, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is a null pointer and &lt;code&gt;lasts&lt;/code&gt; shall be unchanged from the previous call so that subsequent calls shall move through the string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, returning successive tokens until no tokens remain. The separator string &lt;code&gt;delimiters&lt;/code&gt; may be different from call to call. When no token remains in &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, a NULL pointer shall be returned.

The following public-domain code for &lt;code&gt;strtok&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strtok_r&lt;/code&gt; codes the former as a special case of the latter:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* strtok_r */
 char *(strtok_r)(char *s, const char *delimiters, char **lasts)
 {
     char *sbegin, *send;
     sbegin = s ? s : *lasts;
     sbegin += strspn(sbegin, delimiters);
     if (*sbegin == '\0') {
         *lasts = &quot;&quot;;
         return NULL;
     }
     send = sbegin + strcspn(sbegin, delimiters);
     if (*send != '\0')
         *send++ = '\0';
     *lasts = send;
     return sbegin;
 }
 /* strtok */
 char *(strtok)(char *restrict s1, const char *restrict delimiters)
 {
     static char *ssave = &quot;&quot;;
     return strtok_r(s1, delimiters, &amp;ssave);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Miscellaneous functions ====

These functions do not fit into one of the above categories.

===== The &lt;code&gt;memset&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;memset()&lt;/code&gt; function converts &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;, then stores the character into the first &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bytes of memory pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;.

The following is a public-domain implementation of &lt;code&gt;memset&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 /* memset */
 void *(memset)(void *s, int c, size_t n)
 {
     unsigned char *us = s;
     unsigned char uc = c;
     while (n-- != 0)
         *us++ = uc;
     return s;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===== The &lt;code&gt;strerror&lt;/code&gt; function =====
&lt;code&gt;char *strerror(int errorcode);&lt;/code&gt;

This function returns a locale-specific error message corresponding to the parameter. Depending on the circumstances, this function could be trivial to implement, but this author will not do that as it varies.

The Single Unix System Version 3 has a variant, &lt;code&gt;strerror_r&lt;/code&gt;, with this prototype:

&lt;code&gt;int strerror_r(int errcode, char *buf, size_t buflen);&lt;/code&gt;

This function stores the message in &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt;, which has a length of size &lt;code&gt;buflen&lt;/code&gt;.

== Examples ==

To determine the number of characters in a string, the &lt;code&gt;strlen()&lt;/code&gt; function is used:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    ...
    int length, length2;
    char *turkey;
    static char *flower= &quot;begonia&quot;;
    static char *gemstone=&quot;ruby &quot;;
    
    length = strlen(flower);
    printf(&quot;Length = %d\n&quot;, length); // prints 'Length = 7'
    length2 = strlen(gemstone);
    
    turkey = malloc( length + length2 + 1);
    if (turkey) {
      strcpy( turkey, gemstone);
      strcat( turkey, flower);
      printf( &quot;%s\n&quot;, turkey); // prints 'ruby begonia'
      free( turkey );
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the amount of memory allocated for 'turkey' is one plus the sum of the lengths of the strings to be concatenated. This is for the terminating null character, which is not counted in the lengths of the strings.

=== Exercises ===
# The string functions use a lot of looping constructs. Is there some way to portably unravel the loops?
# What functions are possibly missing from the library as it stands now?

[[Python]] is a [[Computer programming/Highlevel|high-level]], [[Computer programming/Structured programming|structured]], [[Open Source|open-source]] programming language that can be used for a wide variety of programming tasks. Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in the early 1990s, its following has grown steadily and interest is increased markedly in the last few years or so. It is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus comedy program.

[[Python]] is used extensively for system administration (many vital components of [[Linux]] Distributions are written in it), also its a great language to teach programming to novice. NASA has used Python for its software systems and has adopted it as the standard scripting language for its Integrated Planning System. Python is also extensively used by Google to implement many components of its Web Crawler and Search Engine &amp; Yahoo! for managing its discussion groups. 

Python within itself is an interpreted programming language that is automatically compiled into bytecode before execution (the bytecode is then normally saved to disk, just as automatically, so that compilation need not happen again until and unless the source gets changed).  It is also a dynamically typed language that includes (but does not require one to use) object oriented features and constructs.

The most unusual aspect of Python is that whitespace is significant; instead of block delimiters (braces → &quot;{}&quot; in the C family of languages), indentation is used to indicate where blocks begin and end.

For example, the following Python code can be interactively typed at an interpreter prompt, display the famous &quot;Hello World!&quot; on the user screen:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Hello World!
&lt;/source&gt;

Another great Python feature is its availability for all Platforms. Python can run on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh &amp; all Linux distributions with ease. This makes the programs very portable, as any program written for one Platform can easily be used at another. 

Python provides a powerful assortment of built-in types (e.g., lists, dictionaries and strings), a number of built-in functions, and a few constructs, mostly statements. For example, loop constructs that can iterate over items in a collection instead of being limited to a simple range of integer values.  Python also comes with a powerful [[Python Programming/Standard Library|standard library]], which includes hundreds of modules to provide routines for a wide variety of services including [[Python Programming/Regular Expression|regular expressions]] and TCP/IP sessions.

Python is used and supported by a large [http://www.python.org/community/index.html Python Community] that exists on the Internet.  The [http://www.python.org/community/lists.html mailing lists and news groups] like the [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor tutor list] actively support and help new python programmers.  While they discourage doing homework for you, they are quite helpful and are populated by the authors of many of the Python textbooks currently available on the market.

{{Python Programming/Note|'''Python 2 vs Python 3:''' Several years ago, the Python developers made the decision to come up with a major new version of Python. Initially called “Python 3000”, this became the 3.''x'' series of versions of Python. What was radical about this was that the new version is '''backward-incompatible''' with Python 2.''x'': certain old features (like the handling of Unicode strings) were deemed to be too unwieldy or broken to be worth carrying forward. Instead, new, cleaner ways of achieving the same things were added.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Namespace|Modules and how to use them}}

Modules are a simple way to structure a program.  Mostly, there are modules in the standard library and there are other Python files, or directories containing Python files, in the current directory (each of which constitute a module).  You can also instruct Python to search other directories for modules by placing their paths in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

== Importing a Module ==

Modules in Python are used by importing them.  For example,
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math
&lt;/source&gt;

This imports the math standard module.  All of the functions in that module are namespaced by the module name, i.e.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math
print math.sqrt(10)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is often a nuisance, so other syntaxes are available to simplify this,
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from string import whitespace
from math import *
from math import sin as SIN
from math import cos as COS
from ftplib import FTP as ftp_connection
print sqrt(10)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first statement means whitespace is added to the current scope (but nothing else is).  The second statement means that all the elements in the math namespace is added to the current scope.

Modules can be three different kinds of things:
*Python files
*Shared Objects (under Unix and Linux) with the .so suffix
*DLL's (under Windows) with the .pyd suffix
*directories

Modules are loaded in the order they're found, which is controlled by sys.path.  The current directory is always on the path.

Directories should include a file in them called __init__.py, which should probably include the other files in the directory.

Creating a DLL that interfaces with Python is covered in another section.

== Creating a Module ==

=== From a File ===
The easiest way to create a module is by having a file called mymod.py either in a directory recognized by the PYTHONPATH variable or (even easier) in the same directory where you are working. If you have the following file mymod.py

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Object1:
        def __init__(self):
                self.name = 'object 1'
&lt;/source&gt;

you can already import this &quot;module&quot; and create instances of the object ''Object1''. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import mymod
myobject = mymod.Object1()
from mymod import *
myobject = Object1()
&lt;/source&gt;

=== From a Directory ===
It is not feasible for larger projects to keep all classes in a single file. It is often easier to store all files in directories and load all files with one command. Each directory needs to have a &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file which contains python commands that are executed upon loading the directory. 

Suppose we have two more objects called &lt;code&gt;Object2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Object3&lt;/code&gt; and we want to load all three objects with one command. We then create a directory called ''mymod'' and we store three files called &lt;code&gt;Object1.py&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Object2.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Object3.py&lt;/code&gt; in it. These files would then contain one object per file but this not required (although it adds clarity). We would then write the following &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from Object1 import *
from Object2 import *
from Object3 import *

__all__ = [&quot;Object1&quot;, &quot;Object2&quot;, &quot;Object3&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

The first three commands tell python what to do when somebody loads the module. The last statement defining __all__ tells python what to do when somebody executes ''from mymod import *''. Usually we want to use parts of a module in other parts of a module, e.g. we want to use Object1 in Object2. We can do this easily with an ''from . import *'' command as the following file ''Object2.py'' shows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from . import *

class Object2:
        def __init__(self):
                self.name = 'object 2'
                self.otherObject = Object1()
&lt;/source&gt;

We can now start python and import ''mymod'' as we have in the previous section.

==Making a program usable as a module==
In order to make a program usable both as a standalone program to be called from a command line and as a module, it is advisable that you place all code in functions and methods, designate one function as the main one, and call then main function when __name__ built-in equals '__main__'. The purpose of doing so is to make sure that the code you have placed in the main function is not called when your program is imported as a module; the code would be called upon import if it were placed outside of functions and methods.

Your program, stored in mymodule.py, can look as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def reusable_function(x, y):
  return x + y

def main():
  pass
  # Any code you like

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The uses of the above program can look as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from mymodule import reusable_function
my_result = reusable_function(4, 5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Links:
* [https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#executing-modules-as-scripts The Python Tutorial - 6.1.1. Executing modules as scripts], python.org

==Extending Module Path==
When import is requested, modules are searched in the directories (and zip files?) in the module path, accessible via sys.path, a Python list. The module path can be extended as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sys
sys.path.append(&quot;/My/Path/To/Module/Directory&quot;)
from ModuleFileName import my_function
&lt;/source&gt;

Above, if ModuleFileName.py is located at /My/Path/To/Module/Directory and contains a definition of my_function, the 2nd line ensures the 3rd line actually works.

Links:
* [https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path The Module Search Path] at Python doc

==Module Names==
Module names seem to be limited to alphanumeric characters and underscore; dash cannot be used. While my-module.py can be created and run, importing my-module fails. The name of a module is the name of the module file minus the .py suffix.

Module names are case sensitive. If the module file is called MyModule.py, doing &quot;import mymodule&quot; fails while &quot;import MyModule&quot; is fine.

PEP 0008 recommends module names to be in all lowercase, with possible use of underscores.

Examples of module names from the standard library include math, sys, io, re, urllib, difflib, and unicodedata.

Shouldn't this be in Psychology? --[[User:Daniel|Daniel]] 10:59, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

Not unless it is a section on Educational Psychology. Typically, this topic is house in Schools of Education, which are housed in the Social Sciences. How does one vote to have a section moved - or does one, in a wiki environment? Should we just opt to move the page as we see fit? That would seem to fit in with the objective of a wiki environment, but I'm new to this and don't want to overstep my boundaries. - Jo Meyertons

== How Humanity Learns ==

This module is correctly placed, in my opinion, in that the subject deals with learning as an empirical process based in a praxis of incremental mental growth. The Humanities take their queues from generations long passed. As learners and teachers, we merely ride upon a wave that is eternal...we didn't make it...it made us.

== Constructivist? or Constructionist? ==

The article uses the term 'constructivist' and also 'constructionist'.  Was this a typo?  Or are they interchangeable terms?

No, not interchangable, Constructionism builds on Constructivism, see Papert &quot;Situating Constructionism&quot;

This is an introduction to the works of Plato. Plato is regarded by many to be one of the West’s greatest ancient philosophers. The student of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle, he wrote many books in his life time and here you will find a brief summary of his works. To find the actual books themselves, look at our sister project [http://www.wikisource.org Wikisource].

Plato was born into an Athenian aristocratic family around 427/428 BC. His father Ariston was said to be an ancestor of the last king of Athens, Crodus and his mother Perictione was a relation of the Greek politician Solon. There is not much external information about Plato's early life and most of what we know has come from his own writings. His father died when Plato was young and his mother was remarried to her uncle Pyrilampes. It is very likely that Plato knew Socrates from early childhood. Perictione's cousin Critias and her brother Charmides are known to have been friends with Socrates and they themselves were part of the oligarchic leadership of 404 BC. These connections should have led to a political career for Plato but at some stage he made a decision not to enter political life. The oligarchic leadership collapsed and democracy was restored and considering that Plato's family members had been part of the oligarchic terror must have meant that his position in Athenian society was under scrutiny. The condemning to death of Socrates by the democracy seems to have been the final political act of the state that forced Plato into exile at Megara. Plato is known to have taken refuge with Eucleides, founder of the Megarian school of philosophy and it is stated by later historians that during this period in his life he travelled extensively through Greece, Italy and Egypt. Whether these journeys took place is disputed but it is known that Plato did travel to Sicily where he met Dion, brother-in-law of the ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius I.

{{hiddenh3|A note on authorship}}
The ordering of the dialogues is based roughly on the standard division into tetralogies. Authorship in many cases is uncertain, as we only have Plato's works as handed down through many generations of translations, forgeries, etc. Please consult the following legend.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; It is generally agreed by scholars that Plato is not the author of this work.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; It is not generally agreed by scholars whether Plato is the author of this work.

[[File:Freidora.jpg|thumb|250px|Using a [[w:deep fryer|deep fryer]] is the safest way to deep fry.]]
'''Deep frying''' involves fully immersing food in hot [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. It is an extremely fast cooking method, and, despite the use of liquid oil, is best classified as a dry cooking method because it does not involve liquid water.

With a deep fat fryer, deep frying is reasonably safe, but hot cooking oil is intrinsically dangerous, and one should be very careful so as to avoid fires and/or severe burns.

== Method ==
Deep frying does not actually make the food greasy if it is done properly. The water in the food repels the oil. However, the hot oil also boils the water within the food, and steams the food from the inside out. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, no oil will enter the food itself. If the food stays in the oil too long, the water will steam out and the oil will penetrate the food. If the oil is too cool, the food won't be done before this happens.

Most fried recipes rely on either a coating of batter or breading, or on foods that have or produce a natural skin around the food such as [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or whole [[Cookbook:Poultry|poultry]] with the skin on. The effect of this is that the outside of the food becomes crispy and browned while the inside is tender, moist, and steamed, similar to searing. Of course, the batter can absorb huge amounts of fat and is usually consumed along with the food, causing the total fat content ingested to increase tremendously.

==Safety==
[[File:Chip-pan-fire.jpg|thumb|Chip pans can be dangerous, and are a leading cause of kitchen fires; this demonstrates a simulation of a chip pan fire.]]

=== Chip pans ===
Chip pans can be '''''dangerous''''' and should only be used with caution and when continuously supervised, preferably with a thermometer; deep fryers are safer. Chip pans are the leading cause of house fires in the UK, and further, may spill hot oil, causing severe burns. If you have a chip pan, your local fire brigade may offer to trade it in for a deep fryer, or can otherwise advise about the dangers.

=== Safety tips ===
;deep fryer, not pan: Deep fryers are less likely to tip than chip pans (avoiding scalding oil), and generally have thermometers to prevent overheating and fires. Familiarizing yourself with operation prior to use is also prudent.
;no ''water'' in oil: Water in hot oil cause ''splatters'' and ''fires'' – it sinks (being denser than oil), then vaporizes, splattering hot oil and possibly scalding. If the oil is on fire, this can cause a chip pan fire ({{w|boilover}}) – a fireball of burning oil ejects from the fryer, posing extreme hazard. In case of fire, do ''not'' use water; [[#In case of fire|see below]] instead.
;fire blanket or suitable extinguisher: Have a fire blanket immediately to hand, to smother fires, or a specialized fire extinguisher marked for cooking oil fires (class K in the US, class F in Europe).
;proper oil: Some oil is not suited for deep frying, smoking at frying temperatures. Suitable oils include refined safflower oil, refined sunflower oils, refined peanut oil, coconut oil (South Asia), and rice bran oil (East Asia).
;do not overheat: Oil is flammable and oil fires are extremely dangerous; before burning, oil will smoke, providing a warning. Most often, one deep fries between 175 and 190 °C (345–375 °F).
;do not overfill: There must be space in the fryer for food to be added – use the recommended amount of oil, and small quantities of food. If there is too much oil or food, oil can flow over the sides, causing fire or burns. Further, small quantities of food cook better.
;use utensils: Use metal utensils to manipulate food in a fryer – a wire cage is the main tool, and a spider or long-handled chopsticks can be used for additional manipulation.
;metal range hood: Cook under a metal range hood: flames from burning hot oil can be 2 or 3 feet high, and can easily burn shelving.
;cool after use: After use, allow the oil to cool for 2 hours before handling.
General cooking advice that particularly applies:
;do not leave unattended:
;do not drink alcohol:
;no children present:
;wear tight, thick clothes: Wear tight-fitting, long-sleeved, thick clothes to prevent burns from splatters, such as mechanics’ shirts and denim, rather than loose, thin clothes such as saris.

=== In case of smoke ===
When the oil starts to give off continuous smoke, you have it far too hot – it is at the [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]], and the oil becomes carcinogenic at this point.
* Turn off your deep fryer, and allow the oil to cool.
* It is likely not acutely dangerous – the fire point and kindling point are generally significantly higher than the smoke point, so the oil will not ignite without further heating – but it is extremely hot, and smoke is a warning sign.
* Next time, use a lower temperature setting or choose an oil with a higher [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]].

=== In case of fire ===
In case of fire, ''call the fire department'' immediately.

Cooking oil fires are extremely dangerous and hard to fight, requiring special measures:
* Burning oil can only be adequately fought with a fire blanket, or specialized fire extinguisher (Class K in the US; Class F in Europe); these may not be available for residential use.
* Water should ''never'' be used on an oil fire; neither should regular fire extinguishers.
If no fire blanket or suitable extinguisher is available, and the fire is small and contained, try quickly adding baking soda as this can quench it (do not add any other substances, which may burn instead). However, in the case of a large cooking oil fire, leave the house and contact the fire department immediately, and do not try to fight it yourself – your efforts are liable to end in disaster.

=== Frying whole poultry ===
A whole turkey is sometimes deep fried during a regional holiday in the United States; one may also wish to deep fry a chicken or other bird. In general, cutting up the bird (or buying it pre-cut) and frying individual pieces is significantly easier and safer; it also makes service easier.

If you wish to deep fry a turkey, please contact your fire department ''before'' doing so, so that you do not need to contact them urgently ''after'' doing so.

The main advice is:
* All usual advice, with extra care.
* Use a specialized turkey fryer, because it is large.
* Carefully measure oil required beforehand, with the actual bird, to ensure that the fryer is not over-filled.
* Cook ''outside''.
* Thaw the bird before deep-frying; advice which deserves to be in bold or caps.

==Tips for frying==
* Generally, cook ''small'' pieces ''briefly'' at ''high'' temperatures to get crisp but not greasy food.
* ''Dry'' food before frying (to avoid splatters), especially soaked potatoes; remove ice crystals from frozen food.
* Foods flavor the oil after use; thus, cook light-flavored food (vegetables) before heavy-flavored foods (fish, shrimp) – or alternatively, use separate fryers for different foods.
* Starting with cold foods (good idea), generally frying temperatures are around 325–375 degrees Fahrenheit (160–190 degrees Celsius). It may be higher for small foods. If the oil is too hot, the outside will burn before the inside is done.
* When starting with warm or hot foods, the oil can be much hotter. (this is why the [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] recipe instructs you to use hot filling, and why the [[Cookbook:Fried Fish|fried fish]] recipe instructs you to microwave the fish before breading and deep-fat frying it)
* Don't add too much food at one time; it will cool the oil too much.
* Do not use a basket with food which could stick to the wires. Alternatively, suspend food in oil with tongs for ten seconds before releasing.
* Consider using deep frying as one step in cooking, to crisp the outside only – similar to broiling or pan-searing. For instance, rather than deep frying chicken from raw to cooked, first roast it, then only finish it in the fryer. Similarly, you may deep fry potatoes as one step in making [[Cookbook:Roast Potatoes|roast potatoes]] – after parboiling, and either before or after roasting.

=== Breading ===
*When breading with a dry powder, use an [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]] or viscous liquid (such as [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]) to make it stick to the food.
*When breading with a moist batter, use [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]], [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] to make it stick to the food, and make sure batter is sufficiently dry on adding.
*Shake off excess batter or breading before frying; otherwise it will come off in the oil, requiring more frequent oil changes.
*Some recommend refrigerating breaded food for a ½ hour before frying, so that the breading sticks better.
Adding too much food to the fryer not only cools the temperture of the oil, it also causes your food to start to produce steam from overcrowding the fryer, and lowers the temperature, this will result in soogy foods and breading falling off the product.

=== Re-using oil ===
*Opinions differ regarding re-use of oil, and the storage of used frying oil.
** Some say frying improves with repeated use of the oil and use one batch of oil for three to six fryings, while others claim used oils are hazardous either due to bacterial growth or due to the breakdown of the oil into harmful compounds.
** Those who reuse oil disagree as to whether refrigeration is necessary, but generally agree that it is important to filter the oil and then store it tightly capped and away from light.
** Discard reused oil when it becomes dark or begins to smell &quot;off&quot;.
*If reusing oil, add fresh oil for each use in order to extend its usefulness.
*Filter your frying oil regularly, if your fryer has a filtering system.
*Cooled oil can be filtered with a tea strainer, kitchen paper, muslin or coarse coffee machine filter paper.
*Change the oil when it becomes extremely dark.  If you don't, your food will all taste the same – fries will taste like fish, fish will taste like fries, and, in the end, everything will taste a bit rancid. 
*A rule of thumb is to change oil each week under heavy use, or every three weeks if it's only used for frying vegetables.
*When using new oil in your fryer, add an extra 1.5 minutes to your frying time.
*Oil can be purified by deep-frying parsley. The parsley absorbs the odors in the oil. Watch for spatters!

=== Oil disposal ===
At some point, oil must be disposed of. Suggestions include:
* Re-use oil for non-deep frying (stores airtight in fridge for months; discard when rancid).
* Dispose at local restaurant, after asking – they often will have cooking oil recycling (into biodiesel or other substances).
* Store (after cooling!) in the original container, milk containers, beer or wine bottles, wide-mouth jars (yogurt, mayonnaise, pickles), and dispose of these, optionally wrapped.
* Use solid fats (lard, coconut oil, Crisco) and allow it to solidify and cool.
* There is a Japanese “oil solidifier” which will solidify oils, making disposal easier.
* Check with local sanitation on proper disposal.

However, do ''not'' dispose down drain, this is illegal in some locations as it can clog pipes and sewers problems and ultimately contribute to decreases the performance of the water treatment plants.

==Serving suggestions==
* Serve deep fried food immediately, or keep warm in oven (95°C, 200°F) in a pan (properly, a jelly roll pan – a raised edge)
* Drain on paper
* Salt immediately, while hot; optionally pepper or use other spices as well.
* Dipping sauce is often desirable.
* A wedge of lemon is also tasty.
* Contrast textures – deep fried food (such as seafood or croûtons) on salad are a classic combination, and tempura in soup is common in Japan
* Forks, chopsticks, and hands are generally the easiest way to eat (due to crust); provide napkins if hands are to be used.
* Drinks-wise, beer, black tea, and soft drinks often pair well; big (tannic) red wines can also work.

==Health==
Some health concerns exist regarding deep frying; some are misconceptions, some are contentious, and some are well-founded. In brief, properly deep frying yields food that is ''crisp,'' not ''greasy,'' and is little different from other frying such as pan-frying. Ultimately, ingredients are fundamental: deep-fried leek is still leek, while a deep-fried Mars bar is still a Mars bar.

===Tips===
* Use appropriate oil (high temperature oil), at appropriate temperature (well below smoke point).
* Cook ''small pieces,'' ''briefly,'' at ''high heat''.
** If it stops making sound, it’s over-cooking.
* Either filter oil or use new oil each time.

===Criticism===
The following are the general criticisms leveled at deep frying:
;Fat is bad (and deep frying is fatty): The image of a vat of oil is shocking and disturbing to some, as though one is going to consume that oil; this fear is largely baseless.
:The oil is used to ''heat,'' and very little is actually consumed. A simple test of this is to inspect the level of oil before and after cooking – it should be almost identical, reflecting that almost all the oil is still in the vat, not in the food. Simply, the hot oil ''heats'' the food and steams it from the inside (steaming is generally considered healthy cooking), as reflected in the sound of steam escaping during cooking; the steam keeps the fat out.
:This is not the case for potatoes, where one intends fat to enter, and hence blanches the potatoes beforehand.
:Pan-frying and stir-frying involve similar coatings of fat, but are less visually striking.
:Further, the proposition that &quot;fat is bad&quot; is contentious, and rejected by many – compare low-fat and low-carb diets.
:Lastly, the oils used in deep frying (mostly monounsaturated vegetable oils) are general highly praised.
;Deep frying creates toxins: There is some basis for this concern – using unrefined oils or oils with low smoke points and raising them to the smoke point causes production of carcinogens via oxidation, as reflected in smoking. This is reduced, if not eliminated, by using refined oils with high smoke points. There are suggestions that toxins are produced below the smoke point, and particularly if oil is reused or kept hot for extended periods – this leads to the suggestion that oil not be reused. Further, pieces of food that fall into oil are themselves impurities and may oxidize on further cooking – this leads to the suggestion that reused oil be filtered.
;Deep frying destroys nutrients: Deep frying is similar to other cooking in nutrient destruction, because the interior is not touched by oil, just heated (steamed, in fact). Cooking destroys some nutrients, while making others easier to digest.
;Deep frying does not provide nutrients: There is some basis for this – Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) are destroyed by deep frying, and must be obtained from other sources – deep fried food should not be one’s only source of fat.

==Commonly deep fried foods==
Virtually any food can in principle be deep fried. Certain classes of food are frequently deep fried:
* Meat:
** Seafood – shrimp, squid, clams, scallops, oysters
** Poultry – chicken, turkey (as parts or whole)
** White fish – fish &amp; chips
* Vegetables:
* Potatoes – fries (chips), chips (crisps)
* Allium (onion family) – onions, leeks
* Green vegetables
* Bread and dough:
** Bread-wrapped – dumplings, egg rolls, empanadas, samosas
** Dough – fried dough
** Bread/starch – croutons, fried bread sticks, tortilla chips, fried noodles
* Other:
** Minced mixtures – croquettes, crab cakes
** Fat – Cheese, Pork skin
** Mushrooms
General categories include fritters and tempura.

More unusually:
* Candy bars – Twinkies, Mars Bars
* Fast food – Hot dogs, Pizza
* Icecream

Red meat (beef, lamb) and fatty fish (salmon) are generally not deep fried, however.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Baking|Baking]]

Bread is prepared by baking a dough made of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (ground grain) and water, and often other ingredients. It may be leavened or unleavened. Salt, fat and a leavening agent such as yeast are common ingredients, though breads may contain a range of other ingredients.

The term &quot;bread&quot; is generally assumed to mean a bread made with [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]. Other times it refers to quickbreads (raised with something other than yeast, commonly [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]) and flatbreads (not raised at all).

There are many types of bread.  Each type of bread has its own history, style, and of course taste. The more you experiment with different types of bread, the better you will be at creating new and interesting recipes.

For an automatically generated list of bread recipes, see [[:Category:Bread recipes|Bread recipes]].  Some selected bread recipes are listed below.

__FORCETOC__

==History==

Bread originated in ancient Egypt where grain was crushed, or sometimes chewed, to create a flat-bread with several varieties becoming available as the dish grew in popularity. Greece, and later Rome, would come to adopt this method of production and spread the dish across the Western world, adding their own variations. Bread has become important both within individual families and across entire cultures. It is now an integrated part of most people's lives, as reflected by the vast array of recipes becoming available.

==Composition==

The amount of water and flour used in a bread are the most significant measurements, because these two ingredients affect texture and crumb the most. With regards to measuring ingredients, weight, instead of volume, is used as the measure. Taking the amount of flour to be 100 percent, common North American table bread uses approximately 50 percent water, resulting in a finely-textured, light bread. Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75 percent water. In yeast breads, the higher water percentages result in more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubbles, and a coarser bread crumb. One pound (500 g) of flour will yield a standard loaf of bread, or two French loaves.

Water, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough. The volume of liquid required varies between recipes, but a ratio of 1 part liquid to 3 parts flour is common for yeast breads, while recipes that use steam as the primary leavening method may have a liquid content in excess of one part liquid to one part flour by volume. In addition to water, other types of liquids that may be used include dairy products, fruit juices, or beer. In addition to the water in each of these, they also contribute additional sweeteners, fats, and/or leavening components.

===Types of flour===
[[Cookbook:Wheat|Wheat]] flour is the most popular flour to use in bread, because wheat has many qualities that contribute to a good loaf. White flour, the refined flour made from wheat, is used more frequently than its unrefined and more nutritious counterpart, whole wheat flour.

Other flours that are used include the flours of [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]], [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], and [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]].

Using a mixture of different flours can make an interesting loaf of bread.

===Liquids===
Sometimes liquids other than water, or in addition to water, are used to form the flour into a paste or dough. These other liquids include dairy products (milk or cream), fruit juices, and beer. In addition to the water in each of these, these other liquids can alter or add sweetness, fat and/or leavening to the bread taste.

===Leavening===
Leavening is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread. Yeast, baking soda, an acidic ingredient like buttermilk to activate the soda, baking powder, steam and beer are the most common leavening agents for bread.

The majority of breads are leavened by yeast. Most bakers in North America leaven their dough with commercially produced baker's yeast. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a pure culture. Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast by preparing a &quot;growth culture&quot; which they then use in the making of bread. This culture kept in the right conditions will continue to grow and provide leavening for many years.

Yeast and sourdough breads follow the same method of production. First the liquid is mixed with the flour, salt and the leavening agent (baker's yeast or sourdough starter). Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not necessary to bake bread, but often used to enhance flavors. The mixed dough is then allowed to rise one or more times, because a longer rising time results in more flavor. So, bakers often punch down the dough and let it rise again. Then loaves are formed, and then the loaves are allowed time to rise a final time. Finally,the bread is baked in an oven.

===Extras===
Once the basic ingredients have been considered for a loaf, a lot of the experimentation comes in the extra additions to a loaf. There is a variety of different types of food to consider adding.

====Nuts and Seeds====
Adding nuts and seeds can instill into your loaf both extra nutrition and variety in taste and texture.

Grinding the nuts or seeds, at least partially, can aid in digestion, provide a smoother consistency to the bread, and allow the dough to hold its form better. Note that flaxseeds especially should be ground, because the human digestion system cannot break them down adequately for maximum nutritional absorption.

====Fruit====
Some fruit, such as raisins, cranberries or dried apricots, may be found enjoyable in a loaf, especially a sweeter loaf.

====Cheese====
Cheese in bread is a popular addition. The cheese may be mixed in directly with the dough, or rolled in during the final shaping stages.

====Herbs and Spices====
Adding different herbs and spices can change how a loaf is perceived dramatically. Consider the difference between a loaf with fresh oregano versus a loaf with fennel seed.

==Preparation==

===Creating the Dough===

The basic procedure for creating bread dough is mixing the flour, water and any other ingredients together until a smooth dough is formed. The dough is then usually left to rest for 20 or 30 minutes; this period is called the autolyse. Then the dough is kneaded for 5 to 10 minutes, until the dough feels well-developed and elastic (knowing when it is done comes with practice).

If milk is being used as one of the 'other ingredients' in the bread dough, it is interesting to note that bakers will often [[Cookbook:Scalding|scald]] the milk first. It is thought that the scalding, by unfolding some of the milk's protein strands, helps to give a better texture, crumb and flavour to the bread.

===Shaping Dough===

Bread can be shaped into a multitude of shapes/styles. The following techniques are used to achieve the desired shape of a loaf: stretching, rolling out (with a rolling pin), rolling up (from a flat shape, to one that looks like a spiral from the side) and/or folding.

The tops of loaves are often scored with a knife to make hash marks prior to baking.

===Rising Methods===

Rising bread allows pockets of gas to form throughout, producing a lighter, more easily-chewed bread.

The traditional way to rise bread is by placing the dough into a moderately warm environment, with enough space to allow it to double in size. A good environment for rising bread is an oven; turning the oven on to a low setting for a few minutes prior to putting the dough in will encourage better leavening (but remember to turn the oven off for when the dough is in!). The dough should either be covered with a tea towel, or with a light coating of oil, in order to prevent its surface from drying out.

Nowadays, many commercial bread producers have proofer systems. These ensure an optimum environment for bread to rise.

===Garnishes===
The types of garnishes that can be applied to a loaf are as varied as the options available for ingredients that can go into a loaf; here are a few:

* [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|Sesame seeds]]: provide visual enhancement, added texture and taste
* [[Cookbook:Poppy Seed|Poppy seeds]]: provide visual enhancement, added texture and taste
* Herbs and spices
* Cheese
* Coarse sea salt
* Diced garlic and/or onion

Some garnishes will stick better by doing the following: after the second rising, and before the bread goes into the oven to bake, paint the top of the bread with oil, milk or an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] white, then carefully apply the desired garnish(es) on top.

===Baking===
Bread is usually baked in an oven with heat ranging from 375°F to 425°F (190 - 218°C).

====Steam Injection====
Sometimes steam is injected into an oven while bread is baking, most notably in the making of [[Cookbook:Baguette|baguettes]]. Rather counter-intuitively, this procedure helps to make a bread crust crispy. When steam is released into a hot oven, with no place to escape, some of it settles onto the surface of the loaf/loaves and has two interesting effects:

# The surface is kept moist and stretchy at first by the steam, which allows the bread to expand. This will make for a lighter loaf.
# When the steam that has settled on the loaf/loaves re-evaporates, it cools the surface of the bread, which allows enzymes some additional time to keep doing their magic before they deactivate from the heat. The enzymes break down long-chain carbohydrates into simple sugars, and this makes for caramelisation, which means added sweetness, a more complex flavour and a beautiful brown colour.

Because of the darkened colour of the loaf due to the second effect, the bread absorbs more heat, becoming darker still and ''drying out''. So, finally we have the answer to how steam makes a crust crisp. Note though that this effect is only applicable in the early stages of baking. Injecting steam into the oven at later stages would re-moisten the bread.

==Going Stale==

Bread going stale is not just a matter of it drying out, although this is a part of the problem. The main reason for staling is the crystallisation of the starch molecules within bread, whereby the molecules lock together. This crystallisation takes time, so the longer the bread sits out, the more that it occurs, and the harder the bread gets.

Moisture in bread sits between the starch molecules, inhibitting the crystallisation process. Evaporation of this moisture therefore contributes to a speedier staling. Evaporation occurs more quickly in loaves with more surface area, which is why baguettes are known for going stale so quickly, and why a big thick loaf can sit on your counter for a day or two and still be edible.

Addition of fats to the recipe (butter, shortening, etc.) can delay the staling effect.

There are many ways to recycle bread that has gone stale, including bread puddings, [[Cookbook:Beer and Rye Bread Porridge (Øllebrød)|bread porridge]], dressing, [[Cookbook:Garlic croutons|croutons]] and kvas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fretboard Tapping==
[[File:Eddie Van Halen 2007-11-10.jpg|thumb|right|Eddie Van Halen]]
'''Tapping''' is the short name of ''fretboard tapping'' or ''finger tapping'', a technique where the fingers hammer down (tap) against the strings in order to produce sounds rather than striking or plucking the strings. If both the left and right hand  are used then it is called two-handed tapping.

It is not clear who first developed tapping but it was certainly popularized by [[w:Eddie van Halen|Eddie van Halen]]. Van Halen was listening to ''Heartbreaker'' by Led Zeppelin and he was quite inspired by the solo, which contained a variation of tapping. This is arguably the song that pushed Van Halen to use &quot;tapping&quot; frequently.

A rather different kind of independent two-handed tapping was discovered by Harry DeArmond and named &quot;The Touch System&quot; by his student Jimmie Webster. The &quot;Touch System&quot; is a complete playing method rather than a technique. Another method of independent tapping was discovered by Emmett Chapman, where the right hand comes over the fretboard and lines up with the frets like the left. The three kinds of tapping techniques are:

===Interdependent tapping===
Interdependent tapping is by far the most common type of tapping. It is generally used as a lead guitar technique, most commonly during solos; however, a small number of songs are entirely tapped. The player's picking hand leaps out to the fretboard and begins to tap the strings with the fingers. However, one must get the pick out of the way in order to tap. Some players do this by sticking the pick between their fingers; others simply use the middle finger to tap.

The Van Halen technique of getting rid of the pick is done by moving the pick into the space between the first and second joints of his middle finger. Eruption by Eddie Van Halen is a good example of this technique.

===The Touch System===
[[File:Stanley Jordan.jpg|thumb|right|Stanley Jordan]]
As mentioned before, this is a whole playing style and a whole book could be written about it. The first musician to play this way was pickup designer Harry [[w:DeArmond|DeArmond]] in the 1940's, who used tapping as a way to demonstrate the sensitivity of his pickups.  While each hand could play its own part, DeArmond held his right hand in the same orientation as conventional guitar technique.  This meant the ability of that hand to tap scale-based melody lines was limited.  He taught his approach to Gretch Guitars employee Jimmie Webster, who wrote an instruction book called &quot;The Touch System for Amplified Spanish guitar.&quot;  Webster made a record and travelled around demonstrating the method. Even though it inspired a few builders (Dave bunker, for example), the Touch System was limited by the lack of equal movements for the right hand and never caught on.

===The Free Hands Method===
In 1969 [[w:Emmett Chapman|Emmett Chapman]], who had no previous knowledge of DeArmond, Webster or any other tapping guitarists, discovered that he could tap on the strings with both hands, and that by raising the neck up could align the right hand's fingers with the frets as on the left, but from above the fretboard.  This made scale-based melody lines just as easy to tap in the right hand as the left, and a new way of playing a stringed instrument was born.  Chapman redesigned his home-made 9-string guitar to support his new playing method, and began selling his new instrument (The Chapman Stick) to others in 1974.  In 1976 Chapman published his volume of collected lessons he used for teaching guitarists and Stick players as &quot;Free Hands: A New Discipline of Fingers on Strings.&quot;

It has been popularised by players such as Tony Levin, Nick Beggs, John Myung, Bob Culbertson, and Greg Howard, and is currently experiencing a surge in popularity due to the internet. Stanley Jordan became famous in the 1980s for using the same method on the guitar.  Jordan discovered the method independently after Chapman did, was signed to Blue Note Records, and released several successful albums.The method that Chapman invented and Jordan also used allows complete self-accompaniment and counterpoint, as on piano.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Operators|Decision Control}}

As with most imperative languages, there are three main categories of program control flow:
*loops
*branches
*function calls

Function calls are covered in the [[Python Programming/Functions|next section]].

Generators and list comprehensions are advanced forms of program control flow, but they are not covered here.

===Overview===
Control flow in Python at a glance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = -6                              # Branching
if x &gt; 0:                           # If
  print &quot;Positive&quot;
elif x == 0:                        # Else if AKA elseif
  print &quot;Zero&quot;
else:                               # Else
  print &quot;Negative&quot;
list1 = [100, 200, 300]
for i in list1: print i             # A for loop
for i in range(0, 5): print i       # A for loop from 0 to 4
for i in range(5, 0, -1): print i   # A for loop from 5 to 1
for i in range(0, 5, 2): print i    # A for loop from 0 to 4, step 2
list2 = [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)]
for x, xsq in list2: print x, xsq   # A for loop with a two-tuple as its iterator
l1 = [1, 2]; l2 = ['a', 'b']
for i1, i2 in zip(l1, l2): print i1, i2 # A for loop iterating two lists at once.
i = 5
while i &gt; 0:                        # A while loop
  i -= 1
list1 = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;]
i = -1 # -1 if not found
for item in list1:
  i += 1
  if item==&quot;dog&quot;:
    break                           # Break; also usable with while loop
print &quot;Index of dog:&quot;,i             
for i in range(1,6):
  if i &lt;= 4:
    continue                        # Continue; also usable with while loop
  print &quot;Greater than 4:&quot;, i
&lt;/source&gt;

===Loops===
In Python, there are two kinds of loops, 'for' loops and 'while' loops.

====For loops====
A for loop iterates over elements of a sequence (tuple or list). A variable is created to represent the object in the sequence.  For example,
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = [100,200,300]
for i in x:
      print (i)   #these parenthesis are needed for the code to get executed in higher versions of Python
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output

 100
 200
 300

The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop loops over each of the elements of a list or iterator, assigning the current element to the variable name given. In the example above, each of the elements in &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.

A built-in function called range exists to make creating sequential lists such as the one above easier.  The loop above is equivalent to:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = range(100, 301,100)
for i in l:
    print (i)
&lt;/source&gt;

The next example uses a negative ''step'' (the third argument for the built-in range function):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print (i)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output

 5
 4
 3
 2
 1

The negative step can be -2:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print (i)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output

 10
 8
 6
 4
 2

For loops can have names for each element of a tuple, if it loops over a sequence of tuples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]
for x, xsquared in l:
    print x, ':', xsquared
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output
 1 : 1
 2 : 4
 3 : 9
 4 : 16
 5 : 25

====While loops====
A while loop repeats a sequence of statements until some condition becomes false. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = 5
while x &gt; 0:
    print (x)  #all the print statement must be in parenthesis for version 3.4.0
    x = x - 1  #the algebra need not be done within the parenthesis
&lt;/source&gt;

Will output:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1

Python's while loops can also have an 'else' clause, which is a block of statements that is executed (once) when the while statement evaluates to false. The break statement inside the while loop will not direct the program flow to the else clause. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = 5
y = x
while y &gt; 0:
    print (y)
    y = y - 1
else:
    print (x)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
 5

Unlike some languages, there is no post-condition loop.

* [http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming 3.2. First Steps Towards Programming], The Python Tutorial, docs.python.org

====Breaking and continuing====
Python includes statements to exit a loop (either a for loop or a while loop) prematurely.  To exit a loop, use the break statement:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = 5
while x &gt; 0:
    print x
    break
    x -= 1
    print x
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output
 5

The statement to begin the next iteration of the loop without waiting for the end of the current loop is 'continue'.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = [5,6,7]
for x in l:
    continue
    print x
&lt;/source&gt;

This will not produce any output.

====Else clause of loops====

The else clause of loops will be executed if no break statements are met in the loop.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = range(1,100)
for x in l:
    if x == 100:
        print x
        break
    else:
        print x,&quot; is not 100&quot;
else:
    print &quot;100 not found in range&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;


Another example of a while loop using the break statement and the else statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
expected_str = &quot;melon&quot;
received_str = &quot;apple&quot;
basket = [&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;melon&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;]
x = 0
step = int(raw_input(&quot;Input iteration step: &quot;))
 
while(received_str != expected_str):
    if(x &gt;= len(basket)): print &quot;No more fruits left on the basket.&quot;; break
    received_str = basket[x]
    x += step # Change this to 3 to make the while statement
              # evaluate to false, avoiding the break statement, using the else clause.
    if(received_str==basket[2]): print &quot;I hate&quot;,basket[2],&quot;!&quot;; break
    if(received_str != expected_str): print &quot;I am waiting for my &quot;,expected_str,&quot;.&quot;
else:
    print &quot;Finally got what I wanted! my precious &quot;,expected_str,&quot;!&quot;
print &quot;Going back home now !&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output:
&lt;pre&gt;

Input iteration step: 2
I am waiting for my  melon .
I hate strawberry !
Going back home now !
&lt;/pre&gt;

====White Space====
Python determines where a loop repeats itself by the indentation in the whitespace. Everything that is indented is part of the loop, the next entry that is not indented is not. For example, the code below prints &quot;1 1 2 1 1 2&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in [0, 1]:
    for j in [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]:
        print(&quot;1&quot;)
    print(&quot;2&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
On the other hand, the code below prints &quot;1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in [0, 1]:
    for j in [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]:
        print(&quot;1&quot;)
        print(&quot;2&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
===Branches===
There is basically only one kind of branch in Python, the 'if' statement.  The simplest form of the if statement simple executes a block of code only if a given predicate is true, and skips over it if the predicate is false

For instance,

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; if x &gt; 0:
...    print &quot;Positive&quot;
...
Positive
&gt;&gt;&gt; if x &lt; 0:
...    print &quot;Negative&quot;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also add &quot;elif&quot; (short for &quot;else if&quot;) branches onto the if statement.  If the predicate on the first “if” is false, it will test the predicate on the first elif, and run that branch if it’s true.  If the first elif is false, it tries the second one, and so on.  Note, however, that it will stop checking branches as soon as it finds a true predicate, and skip the rest of the if statement.  You can also end your if statements with an &quot;else&quot; branch.  If none of the other branches are executed, then python will run this branch.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = -6
&gt;&gt;&gt; if x &gt; 0:
...    print &quot;Positive&quot;
... elif x == 0:
...    print &quot;Zero&quot;
... else:
...    print &quot;Negative&quot;
...
'Negative'
&lt;/source&gt;

===Conclusion===
Any of these loops, branches, and function calls can be nested in any way desired.  A loop can loop over a loop, a branch can branch again, and a function can call other functions, or even call itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Tremolo Picking?==

'''Tremolo''' means a modulation in volume; in the context of stringed instruments, usually refers to repeatedly striking or bowing a single string in a steady rhythm, especially the fastest rhythm the player can maintain. (This technique is particularly common on the acoustic mandolin.) In guitar literature, this is chowder ''tremolo picking'', and one of the few places the term &quot;tremolo&quot; is consistently used &quot;correctly&quot; in guitar literature (whose convention usually reverses tremolo and vibrato). This technique has nothing to do with a &quot;tremolo bar&quot; (really a vibrato bar) or a &quot;tremolo&quot; effects box.

==How to hold the Pick==

Tremolo picking, though appearing hard at first, is actually quite easy. It is merely alternate picking at a faster speed. To start off, a pick makes tremolo picking much easier and is highly recommended when attempting it, but even though most people find tremolo picking much easier with a pick, it is possible without a pick. The best way to hold your pick is between your thumb and the side of the first knuckle of your pointing finger, but if you feel more comfortable holding it another way, such as with your thumb and middle finger then go ahead.

==How to Pick==

The movement should come mostly from the wrist. A little bit of arm movement is okay, but shouldn't be done intentionally. It is possible to tremolo with the elbow, but the wrist is actually easier and faster for most people with practice.

The motion done with the wrist should be like drawing quick zig zags, or Vs. Picking should feel just like writing. Imagine drawing as many connected V's as possible.

Do not play with your hand parallel to the strings. Pick like you write, with your wrist at an angle.

==Grip==

An important aspect of tremolo picking that many beginners fail to realise is that you must have a relaxed grip on the pick, as when you try to pick when holding the pick tensely, you will find that the pick hits the string harder therefore making it harder to pass through the string, causing it to sound sloppy. Maintaining a relaxed grip becomes harder when playing faster, but you will get used to it.

==Things to Remember==

When tremolo picking make sure you use just your wrist, as this will make it much easier to pass through the string. Also, when you pick the string, make sure your hand doesn't go to far away from it, as this will slow you down. The impact from hitting the string usually forces your hand to leave the string, but after practice, avoiding this will become easier.

It's also important to remember that many beginners start to use the thin side of the pick to tremolo, since the thin side has a smaller surface area and passes through the strings easily. This is incorrect, as the pick start to not only damage the strings, but also causes damage to the wrists, and may further start to ring other strings. Use the flat side of the pick to tremolo, not the thin border.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, just wanted to drop off a note. It looks like you joined today, and will be contributing to the Intro to Philosophy book (correct me if I'm wrong). I, myself, joined today and am interested in developing the Philosophy books incl. the introductory text. I started fixing the book up a bit, and left some comments on its present sorry state in the Talk section of the book itself, but I think it will take some serious re-structuring before even really commencing, and there's little of value thus far so we'll essentially be starting from scratch. Oh well, sounds fun!

For what it's worth, I also laid out an outline for a Plato syllabus, though obviously that's a major endeavour.

Anyway... Just wanted to say hi, and welcome, and if my above inferences about you are correct then I look forward to working on this thing together, &amp;c.

Yours,

[[User:Daniel|Daniel]]

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Many beginning or even intermediate guitarists are unaware that their guitar should be &lt;b&gt;&quot;set up&quot;&lt;/b&gt;.  The adjustments described in the adjustment subsections below (along with restringing and tuning) are called a &lt;b&gt;&quot;set up&quot;&lt;/b&gt;.  
 
=What difference does a set up make?=
When a guitar is set up properly:
* the guitar will feel and sound its best
* all the strings will sound with exactly the notes they are supposed to
* all notes will sound correct when played at each fret up and down the neck 
* the guitar will be as easy as possible to play
* strings will break less frequently.
If a guitar plays easily and sounds its best then it's easy for the player to feel successful.


When a guitar is not set up properly:
* the guitar may not feel or sound quite right
* some notes may sound correct while some others may sound sharp or flat
* the guitar may be difficult to play
* strings will break more often
* damage to the instrument could be incurred unwittingly by the player

==When to Set Up?==
When a guitar is brand new and fresh from the factory it may or may not have had these adjustments done.  As a rule, a guitar should be set up when first purchased (used or new) and again when switching string gauges.  Consider getting a set up anytime the guitar sounds or feels different than it used to.  Perhaps after a guitar travels (altitude changes, pressure changes, and humidity can affect the wood in the guitar) and just like changing oil in a car it is a good idea to get a set up every now and then for maintenance purposes (perhaps twice a year).    

Poor set up may be obvious to a player or it might not.  In some cases the guitar may be unplayable because it hasn't been set up.  A maladjusted guitar can cause strange quirks, for instance frets near the bottom of the neck being too sharp, or can even cause damage (e.g., by using .012 gauge strings on a nut designed for .009 strings, and the tension messes up the nut), and it can easily frustrate the player when their playing is perfectly correct yet things still don't sound right.

In particular if your guitar ever becomes difficult for you to play, a set up will probably help.

It is not absolutely ''required'' to set up a guitar, but it is nonetheless a good idea, ''especially'' if the guitar is to be taken to the stage. Some people never get their guitar set up.  Some get their guitar set up even when nothing previously seemed wrong with it, then find such a dramatic change in the guitar's playability and sound that they wish they had set it up sooner.

==How to get a Set Up==
These adjustments should generally be done by a professional, qualified repair person.  They require precision instruments, some hard to find tools, a steady hand, quite a bit of time and know-how.

Virtually all musical instrument stores will be able to perform a professional set up.  Some will do the job better than others.  Call a local music store and ask them &quot;Do you do set ups for electric (or acoustic) guitars and how much would you charge?&quot;.  Getting  a set up will probably cost from $30 to $75 USD.

=Adjustments=
==Adjusting action at the bridge==
This is a simple adjustment that can usually be performed without professional assistance. The bridge saddles should be lowered if the string action is too high, that is, the strings are too far up off the fretboard. In some cases it may be desirable to raise the saddles for a higher string action.

Most electric guitars have two small screws on the saddle which can be used to raise or lower the saddle. Some saddles have screws that can be rotated using the fingers; others require an allen key. Lower the saddles too much and the strings might rattle against certain frets (this may or may not be inconsequential on an electric guitar; listen through an amplifier). In more extreme cases, pressing a string against one fret might actually fret the string against a different fret, usually the one under the intended one. In both cases, filing the frets might alleviate the problem if the saddle really should be that low. Otherwise, simply raising the saddle a small amount on the side with the problem should be fine.

==Filing frets==
The frets go with the shape (or contour) of the neck radius (9, 12&quot;, 16&quot;, etc.) Frets can determine how the notes on your guitar sound (i.e. intonation) and over time and use playing a fretted instrument the frets will begin to wear out by either changing the shape of the crowns (the top of the frets, and they are changed by being flattened out or mis-shaped)or the frets will begin to leave their slots. Fret work should be done by someone with experience doing this kind of job because this is a job that can lead to worse problems on your guitar such as your tonation being worse, action may be higher, strings may buzz out, and it may require that multiple frets be replaced or further repaired. Frets come in a variety of sizes as well making them each different to work on and there are special tools available to do this line of work but many are expensive and without proper training may not be used correctly.

==Filing the nut==
Filing the nut should only be done by a qualified repair person and is used to reduce pressure at the nut to allow a heavier gauge of strings to be used. It may not be necessary if the new strings are detuned lower (e.g., when switching from .009's to .010's, the nut will need no adjustment if the guitar is tuned to Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-Bb-Eb instead of E-A-D-G-B-E).

==Neck/truss rod adjustment==
This particular adjustment has been known to ruin guitars when performed incorrectly, so here referral to a professional repair person is highly recommended. A guitar will need a truss rod adjustment if the neck is not straight. One way to check the straightness of the neck is to play 12th and 19th harmonics on the low and high strings. After sounding each harmonic, fret the note there and play it again: it should be exactly the same pitch. If it is not, the neck ''may'' be in need of adjustment. However, this may be indicative of an intonation problem as well, which ''can'' be fixed without the aid of a repair person; see below. If adjusting the intonation does nothing for you, give the guitar to a repair person.

==Adjusting intonation==
You may notice each string on the bridge sits in a &quot;saddle&quot;. Depending on your setup, you might notice the saddles may be in different positions: some might be pushed forward and others might be pushed back, sometimes slightly. The positioning of the saddle effectively changes the length of the vibrating string. Tune the guitar to concert pitch with the aid of an electronic tuner, making sure the open strings are ''perfectly'' in tune. Play the 9th and 12th fret harmonics, then play the fretted notes. If the fretted notes are sharp, the string is too short and the saddle needs to be pushed back toward the base of the bridge. If the note is flat, the string is too long and the saddle needs to be pushed up toward the nut. Repeat this procedure for each string. Adjusting the intonation should be done every few months or at least twice a year (Every six months interval).

What is visualization?  Put simply it's the act of holding an image or several images in your mind with clarity.  That's all it is.

Doing it is just as simple.

Try this.  Take a common object - pencil, pen, etc. - something that is interesting to your eyes and you feel comfortable with.

Hold it in your hands.  Focus on it and nothing else.  Rotate it slowly so you can see all sides of it.

Now close your eyes.  Try to picture yourself rotating the object in your mind.  Do your best to recall as many details as possible.  Open your eyes if you're unsure about something in particular.  Try to build the object in front of your eyes while they're closed.

It'll take time but not as long as you think.  The important part is to do this every day in some small way.  Like a muscle this ability will grow stronger the more you use it.

Once you've done one object - try for a second one.  Two at once, then three, then four, etc.  Try re-building the room you're in in your mind.  Re-organize the furniture in your mind so the room has all the same parts but is completely different.

Don't be troubled if you can't visualize ''exactly'' right down to the scratches on the wooden coffee table.  That will come with time and practice.  Just keep working at it.

After you're comfortable with visualizing objects, rooms, whatnot, then you can move on to visualizing goals for yourself.

Start with a little bit of motion in your mental scenes.  Put yourself into those scenes.

Again, little by little change the scene you're visualizing to what you want.

Visualize yourself learning something you always wanted to.  Or getting a new job that pays more or has more perks.  Visualize yourself on vacation - a good anti-stress method by the way.

Focusing on these goals using visualization will make them far more real to you and much easier to work towards.

Another exercise for increasing your visualization skills is through art.  Drawing, painting, sculpting and other forms of art are all ways of creating links between your initial perceptions of things, and how well you can recreate those perceptions.  For example:  Try to sketch an object without looking at it.  When you have gotten as far as you can, try to reconcile the drawing with the original image.  How much of what you drew was merely what you expected to see instead of what you actually saw?  

A good drawing exercise for training your perceptions is to try to copy another drawing upside-down.  Take a dollar bill and turn it upside down.  Then try to copy it (not tracing, just copying it line for line).  This exercise helps you to become an accurate scribe of what you see, instead of merely what you think you see.  

The goal is to develop your ability to record specific visual information.  In many cases it is better to amalgamate information instead of remembering every detail.  These exercises will help you develop the ability to choose how your brain will store information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a simple person and like most simple people I'm pretty complex once you scratch the surface.  ;-)

I started doing computer work at the age of 5 when my father was one of the programmers for Globe Glass in Chicago in the 1970's.  I think we were one of the few people that actually had a computer in our living space.  An old IBM green-screen desktop - all one piece - I forget the model number.  One of the old 5100 series boxes with a tape drive in it.  From there I learned how to do basic programming.  My life has never been the same since!  At age 35 I'm still regularly involved with computers and other sundry things.

On other fronts I have many, many things I'm interested in on a semi-regular basis:

Blacksmithing/Swordsmithing

Journals/Writing/Papermaking

Woodworking/Walking Staffs

Pipes - tobacco.  (Check out a friend of mine:[http://www.pipecrafter.com Pipecrafter.com])

Art - sketching and other materials

Medieval Weapons

Artistic Electronics - cool blinkies and ''My blender runs NetBSD'' sort of stuff. ;-)

I've been married now for almost 10 years to a wonderful wife.
I have a daughter who will be 7 this June.  She's Autistic, I have Aspergers, but she's extremely smart.  She just has a serious communication problem.

Other odd things include owning a rusting non-running 1972 International Travellall 1110 that I someday hope to get running.  And a 3x3 sheet of copper that I hope to hammer into a hand-made firepit in the backyard this summer.

It's pretty lame right now but my home site is [http://www.terminalcore.net terminalcore.net].  Please don't hammer my bandwidth. Thanks!


Well, enough jabbering about me.  I hope to contribute more writing where I can and have knowledge.  Long live Wikibooks! *grin*</text>

'''Orange Hot Chocolate''' is a twist on the old childhood favorite.  Note that this hot chocolate is not sweet.  Those who like it sweeter should use a chocolate with a higher sugar content, or add 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] with the chocolate.

==Ingredients==
*4 cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 stick [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*4 oz. [[Cookbook:Chocolate|bittersweet chocolate]], chopped (can substitute semisweet)
*&amp;frac12; tsp. orange extract
*&amp;frac14; tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]

Serves 4.

==Procedure==
# Place the milk and cinnamon in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], and gently heat to just below a simmer, about 180 °F.
# Add the chocolate, and stir while allowing to melt.  Do not allow to come to a boil.
# When the chocolate has melted, strain the chocolate milk into another container, add the extracts, and whisk or blend until frothy.  Transfer to mugs or heatproof glasses and serve.

Go is thought to be the World's most ancient board game, with deceptively simple rules that lead to deep strategy.  After centuries of play, new ideas about the game are still being developed on a regular basis.  In an age when computer opponents can best chess grand-masters, the fact that no computer can present a significant challenge to a strong amateur go player illustrates the abiding depth and complexity of the game.

The game is believed to have originated in China, and is still most popular in East Asia, particularly Korea, Japan, and China. In Korea, it is called 바둑 (Baduk), pronounced [[w:IPA|pa.tukʰ]], Japan where it is sometimes known as 囲碁 (I-Go), pronounced [[w:IPA|i.ɡo]], and China, the game's original home, where it is named 圍棋 ([[w:Traditional_Chinese_character|trad.]]) / 围棋 ([[w:Simplified_Chinese_character|simp.]]) / wéiqí ([[w:Pinyin|Pinyin]]) pronounced [[w:IPA|ueɪ2.tɕʰi2]]. Each of these three countries have professional associations that allow individuals to hold the status of a professional Go player. It enjoys a small but rising popularity in other parts of the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I was interested to notice your links to the Game of Go, which is a game I love - and even though I rarely get a chance to play, Go has played a vital role as one of my guides to strategy in life.

By the way, in relation to strategy in the world of wiki, could I suggest that you set up a user identity on wikibooks so that you can have a name rather than an IP address to identify your contributions.

Also another strategy I might offer - in the spirit on strengthing the connectedness between your moves on the wiki board - that when you make an entry such as [[Go strategy guide]] - that you include a link to the book of which it is a part - I have edited the page to create a link back to [[Board Game Strategies]].

I also may take the opportunity to include some substantive editing of [[Go strategy guide]] in the near future.

In peace

'''Ray Bradbury''' was born on [[en:August 22|August 22]], [[en:1920|1920]] in [[en:Waukegan, Illinois|Waukegan, Illinois]]. By the time he was twelve, he had already started to write stories on sheets of butcher paper. In [[en:1926|1926]], his family started moving back and forth from Waukegan to [[en:Tucson, Arizona|Tucson, Arizona]] before eventually settling in [[en:Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles, California]] in [[en:1934|1934]].

While attending Los Angeles High School, Bradbury had originally wanted to become an [[en:actor|actor]].  His teachers, however, became aware of his talent with the [[en:english language|English language]] and persuaded him to follow a career as a writer. He took their advice and in 1938, the same year in which he graduated from high school, Bradbury published his first short story in ''Imagination!''

[[Image:Rb1945.jpg|70px|left]]

In 1941, Bradbury published his first paid piece of literature, &quot;Pendulum,&quot; in  ''Super Science Stories''. Four years later, in 1945, Bradbury's short story, &quot;The Big Black and White Game,&quot; was chosen to be included in &lt;i&gt;Best American Short Stories&lt;/i&gt;. While browsing books at a book store, Bradbury met Marguerite &quot;Maggie&quot; McClure (1922-2003), who was one of the clerks. They fell in love and were married on September 27, 1947. Together, they had four daughters. During the same year, Bradbury published ''Dark Carnival'', his first collection of short stories.

In 1950, Bradbury published ''The Martian Chronicles'' which established his reputation as an extremely popular science fiction writer. Three years later, Bradbury published ''Fahrenheit 451'', one of his best known pieces of fiction.

An Apollo astronaut named a hill on the moon &quot;Dandelion Crater&quot; after Bradbury's novel  ''Dandelion Wine''. Some of the more conventional honors awarded to Bradbury were the O. Henry Memorial Award, the Benjamin Franklin Award, the Aviation-Space Writer's Association Award for best space article in an American magazine, the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement, the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, and an [[en:Academy Award|Academy Award]] nomination for his short film ''Icarus Montgolfier Wright''.

Ray Bradbury currently lives in Los Angeles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Playfair Cipher''' is one of several methods used to foil a simple frequency analysis. Instead of every letter having a substitute, every digraph has a substitute. This tends to level the frequency distribution somewhat.

The classic Playfair tableau consists of four alphabets, usually in a square arrangement,  two plaintext and two ciphertext. In this example, keywords have been used to disorder the ciphertext alphabets.
&lt;br&gt;
[[image:playfair.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
In use, two letters of the plaintext are located in the plaintext alphabets. Then reading across from the first letter to the column of the second letter, the first ciphertext character is found. Next, reading down from the first letter to the row of the second letter, the second ciphertext letter is found.


As an example, using tableau above, the digraph &quot;'''TE'''&quot; is enciphered as &quot;'''uw'''&quot;, whereas the digraph &quot;'''LE'''&quot; is enciphered as &quot;'''mk'''&quot;. This makes a frequency analysis difficult.

A second version of the Playfair cipher uses a single alphabet.

If the letters of a digraph lie at the corners of a rectangle, then they are rotated clockwise round the rectangle, '''SW''' to '''CK''', '''AT''' to '''EZ'''.

If they lie in the same column or row they are moved one down or across, '''EA''' to '''YX''', '''RS''' to '''TE'''.

The square is treated as though it wraps round in both directions, '''ST''' to '''ES''', '''DO''' to '''IR'''

Both versions of the Playfair cipher are of comparable strength.

==Presentation==

With the mirrors reality check, you check to see if you look normal in a mirror.

You could do this reality check every time you see a mirror.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I walk into a bathroom, and notice a mirror on the wall. I look in my reflection, and see that my hair's purple. My first thought is that I must have dyed my hair purple, but then I can't remember doing that, and realize that I must be dreaming.
* The image of me was blurry, and I didn't recognize my face.
* I looked into the mirror and appeared normal. I tried to change my face and it worked. My face got larger and then smaller.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I'm in a shop selling costumes. I walk up to a mirror, and see that I'm dressed like a clown. I figure I'm trying on a clown costume, and continue on my way nonlucidly.
* I'm walking down a hallway on the upper story of a building, and the floor suddenly collapses and I fall into a room of mirrors. I notice in my reflection that I have green skin, and figure that must be because I was so scared from the fall.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual language interpreting is the practice of deciphering communication in sign languages, which use gestures, body language, and facial expressions to convey meaning.

This book is being communally written (at least that's the idea) to fulfill what is seen as a gap in the literature on Visual Language interpreting. There are many erudite works on the interpreting process, and still others for those who are current practitioners. However, the current introductory texts all suffer from one fault or another: they are inaccurate, obsolete, poorly written, or otherwise faulty.

The solution proposed here is that material be written by practitioners, clients, and academics to produce a text that is both current (and designed to stay that way) and reflective of what is actually practiced by real working interpreters. In short, a text that is theoretically rigorous, unflinchingly realistic, and up to date. For this, we count on you, the reader, to help us build something which embodies our collective wisdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Trapezoid''' (American English) or '''Trapezium''' (British English) is a quadrilateral that has two parallel sides and two non parallel sides.

Some properties of trapezoids:
* The interior angles sum to 360&amp;deg; as in any quadrilateral.
* The parallel sides are unequal.
* Each of the parallel sides is called a ''base (b)'' of the trapezoid. The two angles that join one base are called 'base angles'. 
* If the two non-parallel sides are equal, the trapezoid is called an ''isosceles trapezoid''. 
** In an isosceles trapezoid, each pair of base angles are equal.
** If one pair of base angles of a trapezoid are equal, the trapezoid is isosceles.
* A line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides is called the ''median (m)'' of the trapeziod.
** The median of a trapezoid is equal to one half the sum of the bases (called ''b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'').
* A line segment perpendicular to the bases is called an ''altitude (h)'' of the trapezoid. 

The ''area (A)'' of a trapezoid is equal to the product of an altitude and the median.
:&lt;math&gt; A = mh&lt;/math&gt;

Recall though that the median is half of the sum of the bases.
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac {1}{2}(b_1+b_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for m, we get:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \frac {1}{2}(b_1+b_2) h &lt;/math&gt;

=Voicexml examples=

According to the W3C, &quot;VoiceXML is designed for creating audio dialogs that feature synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations. Its major goal is to bring the advantages of Web-based development and content delivery to interactive voice response applications.&quot;

Here are two short examples of VoiceXML. The first is the always fun example, &quot;Hello World&quot;:

'''Hello world'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;vxml xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
&lt;block&gt;Hello World!&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/vxml&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


The top-level element is &lt;vxml&gt;, which is mainly a container for dialogs. The two main types of dialogs are forms and menus. Forms present information and gather input. Menus offer choices of what to do next. This example has a single form, which contains a block that synthesizes and presents &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the user. Since the form does not specify a dialog after &quot;Hello World&quot;, the conversation ends.

Our second example asks the user for a choice of drink and then submits it to a server script:


'''Form example:'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;vxml xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml
http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/vxml.xsd&quot; 
version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
&lt;field name=&quot;drink&quot;&gt;
&lt;prompt&gt;Would you like coffee, tea, milk, or nothing?&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;grammar type=&quot;application/x-gsl&quot; mode=&quot;voice&quot;&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[
[
[coffee] {&lt;drink &quot;Coffee&quot;&gt;}
[tea] {&lt;drink &quot;Tea&quot;&gt;}
[milk] {&lt;drink &quot;Milk&quot;&gt;}
[nothing] {&lt;drink &quot;Nothing&quot;&gt;}
]
]]&gt;
&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;block&gt;
&lt;submit next=&quot;http://www.drink.example.com/drink2.asp&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/vxml&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


A ''field'' is an input field. The user must provide a value for the field before the next element in the form is referenced or executed. Here is an example of a simple interaction:

*C (computer): Would you like coffee, tea, milk, or nothing?
*H (human): Orange juice.
*C: I did not understand what you said. (a platform-specific default message.) 
*C: Would you like coffee, tea, milk, or nothing?
*H: Tea
*C: (continues in document drink2.asp) 

'''Menu example:''' 


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;vxml xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot;
xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml
http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/vxml.xsd&quot;
version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;menu&gt;
&lt;property name=&quot;inputmodes&quot; value=&quot;dtmf&quot;/&gt;
&lt;prompt&gt;
For sports press 1, For weather press 2, For Stargazer astrophysics press 3.
&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;choice dtmf=&quot;1&quot; next=&quot;http://www.sports.example.com/vxml/start.vxml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;choice dtmf=&quot;2&quot; next=&quot;http://www.weather.example.com/intro.vxml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;choice dtmf=&quot;3&quot; next=&quot;http://www.stargazer.example.com/astronews.vxml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/vxml&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The computer, or receiver, recognizes the number and sends a message to trigger the next dialog, according to which number was chosen. Here is what a typical conversation would look like:

*C: For Sports press 1, For weather press 2, For Stargazer astrophysics press 3.
*H: 4
*C: I did not understand what value you typed. (a platform-specific default message.) 
*C: For Sports press 1, For weather press 2, For Stargazer astrophysics press 3.
*H: 1 “sports”.
*C: (proceeds to http://www.sports.example.com/vxml/start.vxml)


=The beginning of VoiceXML=

VoiceXML began in 1995 as an XML-based dialog design language. It was mainly used to simplify the speech recognition applications in an AT&amp;T project called Phone Markup Language (PML). After the creation of this language, some other companies worked on their own PML-like languages such as Lucent, Motorola (VoxML), IBM (SpeechML), HP (TalkML) and PipeBeach (VoiceHTML). 
Since 1998, The VoiceXML Forum has been developed by AT&amp;T, IBM, Lucent, and Motorola to define a standard dialog design language that developers could use to build conversational applications. They chose XML as the basis for this effort because it was clear to them that this was the direction technology was going.
By 2000, the VoiceXML Forum released VoiceXML 1.0 to the public and submitted it to the W3C to set the language as an international standard. This implementation allowed the release of VoiceXML 2.0, based on input from W3C member companies, W3C working groups, and all kinds of developers.

=Introduction= 

VoiceXML is created to generate audio dialogs that allows the use of synthesized speech, digitized audio, recognition of spoken and DTMF(Dual Tone Multi-Frequency Touch-tone or push-button dialing.) In Layman's Terms, VoiceXML allows the use of computer speech, recorded audio, human speech, and telephones as input and output devices. Pushing a button on a telephone keypad generates a sound that is a combination of two tones, one high frequency and the other low frequency) key input, recording of spoken input, telephony, and mixed initiative conversations.

=VoiceXML architectural model=
The architectural model assumed by this document has the following components:

[[image:Xml_voicexml_architecture.png]]

A document server (e.g. a Web server) processes requests from a client application, the VoiceXML Interpreter, through the VoiceXML interpreter context. The server produces VoiceXML documents in reply, which are processed by the VoiceXML interpreter. The VoiceXML interpreter context may monitor user inputs in parallel with the VoiceXML interpreter. For example, one VoiceXML interpreter context may always listen for a special escape phrase that takes the user to a high-level personal assistant, and another may listen for escape phrases that alter user preferences like volume or text-to-speech characteristics.

The implementation platform is controlled by the VoiceXML interpreter context and by the VoiceXML interpreter. For instance, in an interactive voice response application, the VoiceXML interpreter context may be responsible for detecting an incoming call, acquiring the initial VoiceXML document, and answering the call, while the VoiceXML interpreter conducts the dialog after answer. The implementation platform generates events in response to user actions (e.g. spoken or character input received, disconnect) and system events (e.g. timer expiration). Some of these events are acted upon by the VoiceXML interpreter itself, as specified by the VoiceXML document, while others are acted upon by the VoiceXML interpreter context.

=The Goals of VoiceXML=

VoiceXML's main goal is to bring the full power of Web development and content delivery to voice response applications, and to free the authors of such applications from low-level programming and resource management. VoiceXML sets an integration environment between voice services and data services taking advantage of the client-server paradigm. A voice service can be defined as a sequence of interactive dialogs between a user and an implementation platform. The dialogs are stored in document servers, allowing an independent structure from the implementation platform. These servers maintain overall service logic, perform database and legacy system operations, and produce dialogs. A VoiceXML document interacts with the dialogs from the server using a VoiceXML interpreter. The inputs from the user generates requests to the document server, and finally, the document server replies with another VoiceXML document to continue the user’s session with other dialogs.

VoiceXML is a markup language that:
*Minimizes client/server interactions generating all kinds of interactions per document.
*Shields application authors from low-level, and platform-specific details.
*Separates user interaction code (in VoiceXML) from service logic (e.g. CGI scripts).
*Allows multiplatform development, becoming a common language for content providers, tool providers, and platform providers.
*Offers ease of use for simple interactions, and yet provides language features to support complex dialogs.

While VoiceXML strives to accommodate the requirements of a majority of voice response services, services with stringent requirements may best be served by dedicated applications that employ a finer level of control.

=Principles of Design=

VoiceXML is an XML application [XML]. These are some of the capabilities, or abilities VoiceXML carries:

* The language promotes portability of services through abstraction of platform resources.
* The language accommodates platform diversity in supported audio file formats, speech grammar formats, and URI schemes.
* The language makes it easy to create common types of interactions.
* The language has well-defined standards of wording and syntax that allows for the author's intent regarding the behavior of interactions with the user much easier. 
* The language recognizes semantic interpretations from all types of grammars and makes this information available to the application.
* The language has a control flow mechanism.
* The language enables a separation of service logic from interaction behavior.
* It is not intended for intensive computation, database operations, or legacy system operations. These are assumed to be handled by resources outside the document interpreter, e.g. a document server.
* General service logic, state management, dialog generation, and dialog sequencing are assumed to reside outside the document interpreter.
* The language provides ways to link documents and submit data to server scripts using URIs.
* VoiceXML provides ways to identify exactly which data to submit to the server, and which HTTP method (GET or POST) to use in the submittal.
* The language does not require document authors to explicitly allocate and deallocate dialog resources.

=Implementation Platform Requirements= 
This section outlines the hardware/software requirements to support a VoiceXML interpreter:

'''Document acquisition:''' The interpreter context is expected to acquire documents from the VoiceXML interpreter, requiring the support of the &quot;http&quot; URI protocol. There will be some cases in which the document request is generated by the interpretation of a VoiceXML document, but it can also be generated in response to events outside the scope of the language, like an incoming phone call. When issuing document requests via http, the interpreter context identifies itself using the &quot;User-Agent&quot; header variable with the value &quot;&lt;name&gt;/&lt;version&gt;&quot;, for example, &quot;acme-browser/1.2&quot;

'''Audio output:''' An implementation platform must support audio output using audio files and text-to-speech (TTS). The platform must be able to freely sequence TTS and audio output. If an audio output resource is not available, an error.noresource event must be thrown. These files are referenced by a particular URI. 

'''Audio input:''' An implementation platform needs to find the way to detect and report character and/or spoken input simultaneously. It also needs to control input detection interval duration with a timer whose length is specified by a VoiceXML document.

*Platforms must support the XML form of DTMF grammars described in the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification SRGS.
*It must be able to receive speech recognition grammar data dynamically. 
*It can support other formats such as the JSpeech Grammar Format or proprietary formats. 
*It must be able to record audio received from the user. 
*The platform should be able to support making a third party connection through a communications network, such as the telephone.

'''Transfer:''' The platform should be able to support making a third party connection through a communications network, such as the telephone.

=Concepts =
A VoiceXML document is a conversational finite state machine, in which the user is always in one conversational state, or dialog, at a time. Each dialog determines the next dialog to transition to. '''Transitions''' can be defined using URIs, which define the next document and dialog to use. When there are no more dialogs, or there is an element that explicitly exits the conversation, the execution is terminated.  A VoiceXML document is primarily composed of top-level elements called dialogs. 

There are two types of dialogs: forms and menus. 
A document may also have:

*&lt;meta&gt; elements.
*&lt;metadata&gt; elements.
*variable elements.
*&lt;script&gt; elements.
*&lt;property&gt; elements.
*&lt;catch&gt; elements.
*&lt;link&gt; elements.

'''Forms''' define an interaction that collects values from a set of field item variables. Each field may specify a grammar that defines the allowable inputs for that field. 

'''Menus''' display the information to the user with a choice of options and then transitions to another dialog based on the selected choice. Each dialog has involved a series of speech and/or DTMF grammars, which are active only when the user is in that dialog.

A '''subdialog''' is like a function call because it provides a way to creating and invoking a new interaction, and returning to the original dialog. Variable instances, grammars, and state information are saved and are available upon returning to the calling document. Subdialogs can be used to create a confirmation sequence that may require a database query, create a set of components that may be shared among documents in a single application, or possibly to create a reusable library of dialogs shared among many applications. 

A '''session''' begins when the user starts to interact with a VoiceXML interpreter context, continues as documents are loaded and processed, and ends when requested by the user, a document, or the interpreter context.

An '''application''' is a set of documents sharing the same application root document. Whenever the user interacts with a document in an application, its application root document is also loaded. The application root document remains loaded while the user is transitioning between other documents in the same application, and it is unloaded when the user transitions to a document that is not in the application.

'''Grammars:''' Each dialog has one or more speech and/or DTMF grammars associated with it. In machine directed applications, each dialog's grammars are active only when the user is in that dialog. In mixed initiative applications, where the user and the machine alternate in determining what to do next, some of the dialogs are flagged to make their grammars active (i.e., listened for) even when the user is in another dialog in the same document, or on another loaded document in the same application. In this situation, if the user says something matching another dialog's active grammars, execution transitions to that other dialog, with the user's utterance treated as if it were said in that dialog. Mixed initiative adds flexibility and power to voice applications.

'''Events:''' VoiceXML allows the user to fill forms in the traditional way of user input and defines mechanisms for handling events not covered by the form mechanism. Events can be thrown when the user does not respond, does not respond correctly, or requests assistance. Similarly, the VoiceXML interpreter also can throw events if it finds a semantic error in a VoiceXML document using catch elements that allow the interpreter to trigger such events.

A '''link''' specifies a grammar that is active whenever the user interacts with it. If user input matches the link’s grammar, control transfers to the link’s destination URI. A link can be used to throw an event or go to a destination URI.

=One Document Execution= 
Document execution starts with the first dialog by default. As each dialog executes, the next dialog is determined. When a dialog doesn't reference another dialog, document execution stops.

Here is the &quot;Hello World!&quot; example expanded to illustrate VoiceXML execution. It now has a document level variable called &quot;hi&quot; which holds the greeting. Its value is used as the prompt in the first form. Once the first form plays the greeting, it goes to the form named &quot;say_goodbye&quot;, which prompts the user with &quot;Goodbye!&quot; Because the second form does not have a transition to another dialog, the document execution ceases.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;vxml xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot;

  &lt;block&gt;
     Goodbye!
  &lt;/block&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/vxml&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


=Variables and Expressions=

VoiceXML variables are in all respects equivalent to ECMAScript variables: they are part of the same variable space. VoiceXML variables can be used in a &lt;script&gt; just as variables defined in a &lt;script&gt; can be used in VoiceXML. Declaring a variable using var is equivalent to using a var statement in a &lt;script&gt; element. &lt;script&gt; can also appear everywhere that var can appear. VoiceXML variables are also declared by form items.

The variable naming convention is as in ECMAScript, but names beginning with the underscore character (&quot;_&quot;) and names ending with a dollar sign (&quot;$&quot;) are reserved for internal use. VoiceXML variables, including form item variables, must not contain ECMAScript reserved words. They must also follow ECMAScript rules for referential correctness. For example, variable names must be unique and their declaration must not include a dot - &quot;var x.y&quot; is an illegal declaration in ECMAScript. Variable names which violate naming conventions or ECMAScript rules cause an 'error.semantic' event to be thrown.

Variables are expressed using the var element:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;var name=&quot;room_number&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;var name=&quot;avg_mult&quot; expr=&quot;2.2&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;var name=&quot;state&quot; expr=&quot;'Georgia'&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


==&lt;vxml&gt; Element==


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; style=&quot;font-family:Courier New&quot;
|-
| &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;vxml xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot;&lt;br&gt;xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&lt;br&gt;xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&lt;br&gt;http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/vxml.xsd&quot;
&lt;br&gt;version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;…&lt;br&gt;&lt;/vxml&gt;
|}


Attributes of &lt;vxml&gt; include:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| '''version'''
| The version of VoiceXML of this document (required). The current version number is 2.0.
|-
| '''base'''
| Defines a base URI, to be used when resolving relative URIs in the document.
|-
| '''xmlns'''
| The designated namespace for VoiceXML (required). The namespace for VoiceXML is defined to be http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml.
|-
| '''xml:base'''
| The base URI for this document as defined in the xml-base. It is a URI which all relative references within the document take as their base.
|-
| '''xml:lang'''
| The language identifier for this document . If omitted, the value is a platform-specific default.
|-
| '''Xmlns:xsi'''
| Used along with xsi:schemalocation to indicate the location of the schema for the VoiceXML namespace.
|-
| '''xsi:schemalocation'''
| Used along with xmlns:xsi to indicate the location of the schema for the VoiceXML namespace.
|-
| '''application'''
| The URI of this document’s application root document, if any.
|}

==&lt;field&gt; Element== 

A field specifies an input item to be gathered from the user. Some attributes of this element are:


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| '''name'''
| The form item variable in the dialog scope that will hold the result. The name must be unique among form items in the form.
|-
| '''expr'''
| The initial value of the form item variable; default is ECMAScript undefined.
|-
| '''cond'''
| An expression that must evaluate to true after conversion to boolean in order for the form item to be visited. The form item can also be visited if the attribute is not specified.
|-
| '''Type'''
| The type of field, i.e., the name of a built in grammar type
|}

==&lt;grammar&gt; Element== 

The &lt;grammar&gt; element is used to provide a speech grammar that
*specifies the expressions that a user may use to perform an action or supply information
*returns a corresponding semantic interpretation such as simple values (strings), attribute-value pairs (day, month, and year), or nested objects.
Some attributes of the &lt;grammar&gt; element are:


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| '''version''' || Defines the version of the grammar.
|-
| '''xml:lang'''
| The identifier for the language of that specific grammar (&quot;fr-CA&quot; for Canadian French.)
|-
| '''mode'''
| Defines the mode of the grammar following the modes of the W3C Speech Recognition Grammar Specification SRGS.
|-
| '''root'''
| Defines the root rule of the grammar.
|-
| '''tag-format'''
| Defines the tag content format for all tags within the grammar.
|-
| '''xml:base'''
| Declares the base URI from which relative URIs in the grammar are resolved. This base declaration has precedence over the &lt;vxml&gt; base URI declaration.
|}

==&lt;block&gt; Element== 
This element is a form item. It contains executable content that is executed if the block’s form item variable is undefined and the block's cond attribute, if any, evaluates to true.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;block&gt;
    Welcome to Flamingo, your source for lawn ornaments.
&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The form item variable is automatically set to true just before the block is entered. Therefore, blocks are typically executed when the form is called. Sometimes you may need more control over blocks. To do this, you can name the form item variable, and set or clear it to control execution of the &lt;block&gt;. This variable is declared in the dialog scope of the form.
Attributes of &lt;block&gt; include:


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| '''name'''
| The name of the form item variable used to track whether this block is eligible to be executed; defaults to an inaccessible internal variable.
|-
| '''expr'''
| The initial value of the form item variable; default is ECMAScript undefined.
|-
| '''cond'''
| An expression that must evaluate to true after conversion to boolean in order for the form item to be visited.
|}

==&lt;prompt&gt; Element== 
This element controls the output of synthesized speech and prerecorded audio. Prompts are queued for play, and interpretation will start when the user provides an input. Here is an example of a prompt:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;prompt&gt;Please say your name.&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

You can leave out the &lt;prompt&gt; ... &lt;/prompt&gt; if:
* There is no need to specify a prompt attribute (like bargein), and
* The prompt consists entirely of PCDATA (contains no speech markups) or consists of just an &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;value&gt; element.

For instance, these are also prompts:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
&lt;pre&gt;
Please say your name.

&lt;audio src=&quot;sayname.wav&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

But sometimes you have to use the &lt;prompt&gt; tags when adding embedded speech markups, such as:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;prompt&gt;Please &lt;emphasis&gt;say&lt;/emphasis&gt; your city.&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;prompt&gt; element has the following attributes:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Cond
| Expression that must evaluate to true after conversion to boolean in order for the prompt to be played. Default is true.
|-
| Count
| Number that allows you to emit different prompts if the user is doing something repeatedly. If omitted, it defaults to &quot;1&quot;.
Timeout	The timeout that will be used for the following user input. The default noinput timeout is platform specific.
|-
| xml:lang
| The language for the prompt identifier.
|-
| xml:base
| Declares the base URI from which relative URIs in the prompt are resolved.
|}

Hello,

Isn't there much information on Wikipedia about Cryptography?  And couldn't some of it be brought into this WikiBook?

:Perhaps it would be better just to link to the wikipedia article rather then duplicating text, this would make it easier for editing. A text book about cryptograpy should probably be more about how these relate to eachother. Wikipedia could be more about the descriptions of types of cryptography. --[[User:RobKohr|RobKohr]] 17:14, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::I agree, there is no point in creating as many articles as there are in Wikipedia, then just copy text from it (which will miss all the subsequent updates). I think we should ''link'' to Wikipedia articles ''all the time'', '''''except''''' when we are sure an article will soon have more material in the wikibooks article: indeed, some content, like precise and/or long guides or tutorials, are better off wikipedia, but would fit well here as I understood. Duplicating everything would not be only impossible in terms of manpower, it's also a pure waste of time. --[[User:ClementSeveillac|ClementSeveillac]] 04:14, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I think one thing that should be added to this book that is not on wikipedia is lots of examples going through  the processes of making and breaking encryptions. [[User:Lonjers|Lonjers]] 01:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

I think copy+pastaing the wikipedia articles is the best compromise because we can get good starting material without the downside of linking as linking would make it hard for someone to add detailed book-like entries. Does anyone have any objections to me doing that? If not I'll start copying the wikipedia entries later tonight.

== Dictionary attack ==

In addition to the brute force attack, isn't there also a method called dictionary attack, where you use a set of keys (in most cases, common words, from dictionaries) to test against the ciphertext? --[[User:DarkPhoenix|DarkPhoenix]] 19:56, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== WikiReader:Cryptography; improvements for existing chapters here==
There is an active project to produce a WikiReader on Cryptography from articles on the Wikipedia. While it will not be, quite, a textbook, it may be that the articles proposed for it will be suitable for parts of this project. 

In addition, several of the existing chapters/sections here would be improved by importation of more content from the parallel articles on the Wikipedia. Since those articles are GPL'd, they are freely available for use here. 

Best wishes on the project. I'll try to look in from time to time and may be able to help with the occasional chapter. ww (from en.Wikipedia.org)

== tools ==
It'd be nice to find some links to free tools one might need / want to use, incl. a short description of the security level (known weaknesses), license, encryption types etc.

== steganography (?) ==
I'm not sure how it's written, but I mean hiding encrypted information inside other documents without influencing the usability of the host documents. IMHO this type shall be part of a crypto book, as it shows users how to make information even more difficult to get. One nice thing is [http://www.darkside.com.au/ice/] which hides info in plain text and is open source, so ideal for learning.

''[[Wikipedia:steganography]]''

* I agree, Steganography is a very valuable part of classical ciphers, aswell as current, since it can lead to plausible deniability. [[User:Tinned Tuna|Tinned Tuna]] ([[User talk:Tinned Tuna|talk]]) 21:53, 8 January 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;simple&quot; secure ciphers ==

* http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CipherJedi
* http://metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Pontifex

Is the &quot;Pontifex&quot; cipher important enough to be added to the [[Cryptography/Timeline of Notable Events]] ?
Perhaps something like:
* 1999: Bruce Schneier develops a way to allow field agents to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools. Unlike all previous manual encryption techniques, this one is resistant to machine cryptanalysis. It becomes published in Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon (2000).

: Probably not. People have found weaknesses with Pontifex/Solitaire [http://www.ciphergoth.org/crypto/solitaire/]. Moreover, I'm sure Schneier isn't the first to come up with a strong hand cipher; the spooks must have researched this heavily). And, of course, the one-time pad is a manual encryption technique that is resistant to machine cryptanalysis. [[User:Matt Crypto|Matt Crypto]] 12:54, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: ''People have found weaknesses''. So? People have found weaknesses in the [[Wikipedia:Data Encryption Standard]] (DES); are you going to take it off the timeline? As far as I can tell, Pontifex is *still* more resistant to cryptanalysis than any other manual encryption technique that I've ever heard of (except the one-time pad).

:: ''I'm sure Schneier isn't the first to come up with a strong hand cipher'' Nope. Schneier's method is the first ''to be published''. (As far as I know -- I would be surprised and delighted to see an earlier method. Schneier and others seem to think it's never been done before). (I agree that it is ''likely'' that someone has developed some kind of manual cipher earlier and kept it secret. But such speculation is, well, speculation).

:: ''And, of course, the one-time pad is a manual encryption technique that is resistant to machine cryptanalysis.'' It's not merely &quot;resistant&quot;. The one-time pad is completely impervious to machine cryptanalysis. However, Schneier developed Pontifex in response to a different kind of flaw in the one-time pad system. It's ''better than the one-time pad'' in some ways, worse in other ways. I hope the timeline entry makes that clear. (Any suggestions on how to make that timeline entry clear, yet brief ?)

== Moving documents from Wikisource ==

Hi,

There is now a [[s:Wikisource:Proposed deletions|discussion]] about [[s:Wikisource:Cryptography|cryptography documents]] in Wikisource, which, I think, should be moved here. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 09:55, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
* [[Cryptography/Prime Curve/Affine Coordinates]]
* [[Cryptography/Prime Curve/Standard Projective Coordinates]]
* [[Cryptography/Prime Curve/Jacobian Coordinates]]
* [[Cryptography/Prime Curve/Chudnovsky Coordinates]]
* [[Cryptography/Prime Curve/Modified Jacobian Coordinates]]
* etc.

: A short explanation of the pages refered to above: An elliptic curve over a finite field consists of a set of points, derived from a set of coefficients. For these points there exists an addition law. Due to this addition law the points of such a curve form an abelian group. There are several ways to represent the points of an elliptic curve and there are as many ways to perform the point addition efficiently. Months ago I compiled a collection of these representations together with the optimal addition routines and put them into wikisource. Because the semantic of &quot;What does Wikisource host?&quot; changed in the last week the Wikisource maintainers began to move the pages here, to the wikibook:cryptography.
: To the wikibook:cryptography maintainers: how and where can these addition formulas best be included in your book? The following material is for disposition:
: # 8 pages with different point representations / addition formulas
: # 3 pages with coefficient sets
: # 15 pages with test vectors (these pages are already lost, the maintainers deleteted them without discussion; but they can recreated, I still have got the original material)
: Perhaps at least the test vector pages and the coefficient sets should be moved to an annex of this wikibook. I also see the 8 pages of formulas as some kind of &quot;reference material&quot;. Where could it be put?
: Any thoughts? --dm

== Cool! ==

Nice looking book you got here.  I'd like to see more done with it! -[[User:witerhawk|witerhawk]] [[User:Witerhawk|writerhawk]] 15:55, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

== Scope? ==

This currently covers only symmetric-key encryption, but misses out on a whole slew of other topics central to cryptography (public-key encryption and digital signatures, to name two). Perhaps the title should be changed?

:Why don't you add the missing content ? The title &quot;defines&quot; the scope, missing content only demonstrates that there is still work to be bone...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:55, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

== Pontifex cipher ==
Hey.
I saw that there's link named &quot;Pontifex cipher&quot; - if that page is gonna be about cipher described in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; by Neal Stephenson, then in my opinion it sould be called &quot;Solitaire&quot;. Take a look at [[w:Solitaire (cipher)|Solitaire (cipher)]] and [http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html Bruce Schneier's webpage about Solitaire].

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called PrezKennedy. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name PrezKennedy~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I beg to differ on the statement that very few pieces are written specifically for the classical guitar, and that most are originally written for the lute and piano. You are referring mostly to music from the baroque period. There are now many classical works which are written for the guitar, including concertos, such as those by Rodrigo. Villa-Lobos, Barrios, etc, all wrote for the classical guitar.


Title should be more specific, e.g. &quot;Rudimentary Guitar&quot;
-- [[User:Daniel|Daniel]]

Hehe, yeah, I didn't know where I was going with it when I created it. It looks, though, like it's going to (attempt to) be a complete reference from a learner's perspective, rather than be a lesson-oriented book. I haven't settled on a title yet, myself, but of course anybody is welcome to suggest one.

BTW, do you really think we need a chapter on standard notation? The whole idea of standard notation is that it's not limited to guitar (in fact, it was rather designed for piano, IIRC), and very little of it is ''specific'' to guitar. Usually standard notation is presented along with tablature in music books for guitar, so the necessary information can probably be presented there. Because standard notation is not trivial to explain, either, I don't think it belongs here. Perhaps somebody could start a music theory book and include it there, and our book can link to it.

--[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 11:14, 1 May 2004 (UTC)


I see your point, but I still think there should be chapter explaining standard notation, even if no further use of it is made in this book. As you say yourself, standard notation applies to all music, not just guitar, which makes it ''extra'' useful to learn, not less so; learning guitar means learning about music, and a large proportion of the skills and knowledge here transfer directly to other instruments, which is a good thing. For instance, almost all of this guitar book applies to bass guitar as well (I was considering adding little comments explaining where something does ''not'' apply to bass, and pointing out in the intro that this book also teaches bass). Furthermore, even for guitar itself it's extremely useful: you've referred to classical guitar a number of times and that will ''always'' require an understanding of standard notation, plus in many contexts outside of pop-rock guitar it's an essential skill.
I haven't changed the text back to include the stub for standard notation, I'll wait till we finish discussing it, but I ''really, really'' think it belongs here and should be explained.

--[[User:Daniel|Daniel]] 19:14, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

:How about we rename the tablature chapter to something like &quot;Music notation&quot;, and on the TOC add a note saying &quot;tablature and standard notation&quot;? I agree with you that the learning of standard notation is essential, but it's a bit of a separate problem than learning to play the guitar. Of course, as you pointed out, it's still important regardless, but this leaves us with a dilemma: the inevitable duplication of information. Somebody else might write a book about the violin, and then somebody starts writing about the piano, then yet another person starts writing about music theory. All of these should have some information on standard notation -- but we don't want to say the same things in different places, because it takes more effort for no gain. So I'm saying we should find a common place to put it and then cross-reference it instead of putting it in the guitar book. See what I mean?

:--[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 00:29, 2 May 2004 (UTC)

::I'm fine with that. So let's have a &quot;Music notation&quot; chapter, which can be essentially what the tablature chapter is now, and we'll add at the bottom a (very) brief explanation of standard notation with a reference to a more general-purpose lesson on standard notation (which can be created later). Sound good?

Im the one who started [[Guitar:Philosophy]] thread, mostly as a non-technical idea, to fill in the gaps that the other book does not cover. You can get a sense of that from the outline. Me: Ive been playing guitar for about 20 years, I have perfect pitch, and am more into structured jamming, going into differring styles of play. I dont read notation, but I do well with chord charts, and short notated motifs and phrases.

I have lots of other interests, but the book idea seems like a good one. I didnt mean to imply a replacement for the existing text, I just had some thoughts and insights as to what might be a good way to frame the idea of being a guitar player. -[[User:Slide|Slide]] 16:40, 27 May 2004 (UTC)

==Comments from 2007==
===Lesson oriented book?===

Sorry to start a new discussion here, but are there plans for a lesson orientated book? The guitar book in its current form seems like little help to a complete novice. Heres a layout that might make a good start for an absolute beginners book:

The Guitar
  -&gt; Acoustic
  -&gt; Electric
  -&gt; Further Reading (links to History of Guitar, How guitars make noise, Famous Guitarists. etc)
Holding the Guitar 
  -&gt; Left Hand Position
  -&gt; Right Hand Finger Picking Position
  -&gt; Right Hand Holding the Pick
Music Theory: Notes
  -&gt; Notes
  -&gt; Notes on the fretboard
  -&gt; Tips to help eventually memorize all the notes on the fretboard
Song Notation
  -&gt; Tab
  -&gt; Classic 
Practice Songs
  -&gt; Simple songs constructed of notes (this will be hard due to copyrights)
  -&gt; Suggestions of good tabs on the internet
Music Theory: Chords
  -&gt; Basic Chord theory (should link to Music Theory for more information)
copy  -&gt; Basic Chords (and how to finger them)
  -&gt; A maj, C maj, D Maj, G Maj, E Maj, C min, D min, E min, A min
Practice Songs
  -&gt; Simple songs using Chords (again, hard to find good stuff due to copyrights)
  -&gt; Suggestions of good tabs on the internet
Further Learning (reference to a sequal wikibook, Music Theory, Favorite Guitar Books)
Conclusions
Pep talk closing speech.

Again this would focus on only the very basics, emphasis on trying to get the learning playing some simple songs, without fear that they're method is incorrect. This book would hint at things like scales and chord construction techniques and rythm, without going into detail. These topics would be covered in follow up material.

I haven't started any information because I would hate to 'fork' the guitar book project. What are your opinions on this book layout?

:I myself like the idea, and do not think that a fork is that bad an idea.  I actually was about to do the same thing, when I read your post.  The lesson-oriented book, called &quot;guitar lessons&quot; or something, would more complement this book than fork it.  They would cross-reference each other whenever possible, and though they would unavoidably repeat much of the same information (which isn't a wiki-sin) the lesson book would be much more oriented towards learning and ordered differently.  While there are good lesson sites out there already, none of them are wikis, and many have a slant towards one genre.  Also, it would be nice to have a lesson book, that, if good, would eliminate the need to wade through the &quot;trial/pay lessons&quot; and money shams (there are a lot of them).  The wiki could link to good lessons elsewhere on the net.

:That said, we would not have to rewrite this book, and we can link to this book whenever it makes sense.

:Assuming there is decent support for it, I will continue.  If someone decides to make one, I will contribute a lot.  But I'd rather someone else started one.

It exists already a guitar course with complete very detailed and beginner-friendly lessons on the German Wikibooks. I had offered months before already my assistance, but it did not seem to exist any interest. You only would have  to transferred these lessons only into the English (by Alta Vista babel fish),  and after this  you need a stylistic revise. I would crib myself from in response with you, as their it makes better, and surly I could brush up my English. on the other hand you could still fill my gaps, and I can copy your ideas for the German.[http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_Grunds%C3%A4tzliches_zum_Greifen_der_Akkorde Example1], [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Gitarre:_G_Em_C_D Example 2] [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kategorie:Liederbuch/_Lieder Songs without copyright] ...

:Sounds good to me.  I can't read any of it, but it looks detailed and complete.  I haven't checked this place in a while because noone responded.  I can see right now that Babelfish will not help much at all, the page makes no sense, so we will have to write it all over again anyway.  I'll work on it some more now (I'd forgotten about it) and we can fact-swap so that both the English and German versions have all the information in them.  I know about six words in german, so I can't really translate anything, nor can I navigate the page.  But, we can do it somehow.  Soon enough, this book will be on par with all the other lesson sites on the internet, hopefully.

== Guitar woods ==

I believe there should be some info on specific guitar constructions and materials, because these offer vastly different sounds for the guitar. Guitarists and potential luthiers would both appreciate the addition. --[[User:Alexnye|Alexnye]] 06:42, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

== Styles ==

I added a 'Styles' section to the main page.  I thought the book needed one.  I put them in alphabetical order.  Feel free to add whatever other genres you think could use a page ( as if I needed to tell you that!), but I think it would be best if the categories were kept broad.

In my opinion, this book seriously lacks images and schemes - how to grab guitar, play certain chords etc. Take a look at [[:de:Gitarre: Inhaltsübersicht|German book]] - they have many graphics. If you like graphics there, please move them to [[commons:|Commons]]. If you don't know how - no problem, I can help.

:One step further, find a bilingual german/english Wikipedian and a Wikipedian whose native language is the opposite of this Wikipedian (so a German who speaks English and a native English speaker, or vice versa; two bilinguals of opposing native languages works best) that will volunteer to do an exhaustive quality check.  Read the whole of both books, discuss them, eliminate the weaknesses from both and combine their strengths, and make each a direct translation of the other.  Doing this with two bilinguals will actually produce the best results. --[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] ([[User talk:Bluefoxicy|talk]]) 03:52, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

== Electric guitar mods ==

I recently started learning to play the guitar and wound up grabbing a large amount of equipment for cheap, including:

* $150 Epiphone Les Paul Special 2
* New push-pull pots (500k,500k to replace 300k,500k)
* New pickups
* Two capacitors (0.022uF, 0.047uF)
* New tuning machines (locking)

I have a number of things I can play with now, such as:

# Cap mod:  Pull tone pot to switch from 0.022uF to 0.047uF
# Split coil:  Pull vol pot to switch from Humbucker to Single Coil
# Series mode:  Pull vol pot to place the coils in series instead of parallel
# Phase switch:  Pull vol pot to switch the phase on one pickup
# High protection:  Add 560pF cap and 300k resistor in parallel across the hot leads of vol pot

Mod (1) uses the tone pot, and mod (5) stands on its own; mods (2), (3), and (4) use the Vol pot and I can only do one.

Mod (1) will allow a mode where the tone pot kills more of the highs, giving a darker sound when pulled.

Mod (2) will give a single-coil sound, but eliminate the noise removal.

Mod (3) will give a mode that produces a brighter sound.

Mod (4) may produce a unique, &quot;nasal&quot; sound; or it may just cancel the sound.

Mod (5) protects high frequencies.  When turning up the volume, the higher frequencies sometimes do not increase in volume as fast as the lower frequencies (my pickups specifically cause this situation); the RC circuit here prevents this, so the volume control works more smoothly across all frequencies instead of leaving the highs behind.

After a lot of googling, I will probably go with mods (1), (4), and (5); yet I have not quite determined how mods (2), (3), and (4) will actually affect the instrument.  A section of the Wikibook devoted to explaining the guitar's internal electronics and how they affect sound, along with possible modifications controlled by various switches, may prove interesting.  Not so much of a list of possible projects, but more a list of more general theory like what phase switching does and how the impedance of multiple coils affects their interaction; what various capacitors do; what changing the vol and tone pots does (500k vol + 1M tone == brighter sound than 500k + 500k, where a 1M + 1M might just cause noise if the pickup won't handle the 1M vol pot...).

I also threw on some locking tuners and some locking strap holders.  Not quite sure how this fits in with the above but it's fascinating.  --[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] ([[User talk:Bluefoxicy|talk]]) 03:48, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

== How can I play the B chord (Blues)? ==

I'm sorry, but I can absolutely not spread my fingers so that I could play the a string at the second and the d string at the sixth fret simultaneously (the the section about Blues). Does anyone have tips for me how I could manage it? Which fingers shall I use?

Your question is old, however: you could take B7. It's no barree chord! On http://chords.buschhausen.eu/vol1/ you can look at the fingering. Barree chords in the I. and II. fret are not easy for beginners. I let my students start barree playing with chords in the V. fret... http://chords.buschhausen.eu/vol2/ sorry, written in my native language but the PDF tablature and the playalong MP3 file are international.

==Just one comment from a nobody...==

This book is very very very blues and rock oriented. Leaving aside that rock guitar may not be the best way of teaching guitar to a novice regardless of the guitar style he's aiming at (I'm not a teacher and I don't know nothing about teaching, I personally think that a classic guitar player will easily learn to play rock music whereas a rock player will learn classical pieces with extreme difficulties), it should at least be mentioned at the beginning of the book that what is presented here is at the moment the most popular way of approaching guitar playing, but by no means the best.

:: It is an excellent book and contains a vast amount of information that would be useful to any gutarist . Contains information ranging from stringing and cleaning guitars to scale theory. However I've removed the Amazon link for the simple reason of allowing the student to source the book themselves. E-bay, second-hand bookshops, discount book stores, etc. All of these may prove to be cheaper. I feel it is only fair not to guide any reader to a single &quot;buy site&quot; site regardless of the reason that the editor who provided the original link may have had.

Having myself thoroughly reviewed over 400 guitar methods, I respectfully disagree that The Guitar Handbook by Ralph Denyer is a good reference here. The current Guitar Wikibook is already similar: a compilation of a bunch of reference topics that would be better left to Wikipedia. What we need is actual pedagogy, and both Denyer's book and 99% of the current Wikibook are atrocious for that. Aside from the German Wikibook mentioned above, another decent resource that is compatibly licensed (it is CC-BY) and could be incorporated here is: the [http://cnx.org/content/col10421/latest/ Connexions Guitar Course]

== External links and Advertising - Analysis ==

I'm going to use this section to do a comparative study of the featured books. Today I looked at three other featured books and noticed they all had no external links to commercial sites on their main entry page (contents page, cover page or whatever you wish to call it). I have a feeling that the Guitar book may be suffering from commercial interests occupying the front cover. Below is a list of featured books and alongside each title I will detail whether commercial or non-commercial external links are present or not. 

I will use a numerical key system:

* 0 = no external links
* 1 = external links to commercial sites 
* 2 = external links to non-commercial sites
* 3 = mixed external links (commercial and non-commercial)

I started and then thought why not just remove all the external links from the front page and see how the community reacts. I cannot see any purpose in having these &quot;adverts&quot; placed on the front of the Guitar book. They are profiteering from this placement and when did all these sites disappear from Google or the net therefore they are already available to readers through search engines. They have an online presence so do we need them to further their internet presence at the expense of the Guitar book.  

I'll remove them now and if you feel differently then restore them and leave a reason here. Before you do restore them bear in mind that the argument that &quot;they are resources that help readers&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;why not let Google and these sites profit from our non-profit endeavors as well as profit from our readers&quot;. Please note that all Wikibook editors work for nothing and our readers pay nothing. 

This action applies only to the sites that carry adverts.

[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sluffs|contribs]]) 19:58, 10 June 2013 (UTC)

I removed the external links to the chord finder software sites. You know the type where they show you the fingerboard and you have a chord menu and you select the chord you want and the dots appear. These auto-generated chords are terrible and most of the time you wouldn't be able to use them fluently since they are not designed to teach you how to move from chord to chord. There's some exercises in the Jazz section which though advanced should illustrate this point. In Jazz Movement Exercise One your little finger should be on the B note (4th fret G string) and if you follow the exercise you will notice that your little finger stays on that string and just moves one fret out then back in and then back out. You don't need to remove or lift the little finger of the string. This is a Jazz approach (Classical guitar as well) - Jazz guitarists are expected to play at fast tempos and if they were to use all six strings they would soon falter. So from the early days of the guitar they adopted an &quot;economical&quot; movement to their chord changes. Jazz Movement Exercise One in the Jazz section goes G - C (2nd inversion - basically you're keeping the G in the bass for ease of movement) - G7 (the chord finders I've removed from the external links section on the front page of this book will show this chord as a four note chord but notice that in the exercise the 5th, the D note of the G7, is omitted - once again to aid movement). This is why I've removed the links to these auto-chord finders - they just cause problems in positioning and fluency. Why do it the hard way? 

Tip: musicians exploit a very human trait - basically audiences will fill out the missing notes (harmony) if need be - try singing the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; and pay careful attention to what your mind is really creating - when a familiar melody is presented to the mind without chordal accompaniment the mind creates the harmonic framework for understanding the relationship that exists between the melodic notes. As a further example of this - audiences may not know anything about key changes or how to use a pivot chord to change key but they will know you've changed key.

Hopefully you'll agree that these chord finders, though great pieces of software or applets, are not good for positioning and fluency.

=Learning objectives=

Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to
*Learn the basics of DocBook
*Create a DocBook document by using the DocBook XML DTD
*Convert a text document to a DocBook document
*Use XSL Stylesheets to transform a DocBook XML document to multiple formats as HTML, PDF or presentation slides.

=Introduction=
DocBook is general purpose XML and SGML vocabulary particularly well suited to books, articles, and papers.  It has a large, powerful and easy to understand Document Type Definition (DTD), and its main structures correspond to the general concept of what constitutes a book.  DocBook is a substantial subject that we can't exactly cover in a few pages.  Thus, for the purposes of this chapter, we will talk about creating a simple DocBook document with major elements in the Docbook DTD and the details of publishing the document in order to give you a feel about DocBook.  If you would like to study the subject further, we suggest you to have a look at the references provided at the end of the chapter.

=What is DocBook?=

*DocBook enables you to author and store document content in a presentation-neutral form that captures the logical structure of the content.  
*It has an easy-to-understand and widely used DTD.  The DocBook tags are applied so that they have a certain &quot;common sense&quot; semantic content, at least to English speakers. 
*There are no official versions of the DocBook W3C XML Schema at this time.  The DocBook Technical Committee is planning to offer an official Schema in the DocBook V5.0 time frame.  The examples provided in this chapter will use the current official DTD.

==DTD vs. Schema:== 
A DTD is the XML Document Type Definition contains or points to markup declarations that provide a grammar for a class of documents.  A Schema is a set of shared vocabularies that allow machines to carry out rules made by people.  It provides a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents.  In summary, schemas are a richer and more powerful means of describing information than DTDs.

&lt;small&gt;Table 1: Here is a simple xml document&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;author&gt;
   &lt;firstname&gt;Rusen&lt;/firstname&gt;
   &lt;lastname&gt;Gul&lt;/lastname&gt;
 &lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


&lt;small&gt;Table 2: Here is the DTD for this document&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT author(firstname, lastname)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT firstname(#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT lastname(#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Table 3: And here is the SCHEMA &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;xs:element name=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
     &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
   &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Output formats for DocBook==
XSL (Extensible Style Language) stylesheets can transform DocBook XML into the following formats: 
*HTML
*HTML Help (for Windows Help)
*Java Help
*XHTML
*XSL Formatting Objects (FO)
*PDF

DSSSL (Document Style Semantics and Specification Language) stylesheets can transform DocBook SGML into the following formats: 
*HTML
*MIF
*RTF
*TeX

==A Brief History==
DocBook was created around 1991 by HaL Computer Systems and O'Reilly &amp; Associates.  It was developed primarily for the purpose of holding the results of troff conversion of UNIX documentation, so that the files could be interchanged.  Now it is maintained by OASIS.  The official web site for DocBook is http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/

==DocBook is used for:==
#Books for print/trade publication. Many authors are using DocBook for writing books of all kinds, in various print and online formats, worldwide.  Some examples include:
#*[http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/books/xmljava/chapters/ Processing XML with Java ]

DocBook is officially available as a DTD for both XML and SGML.  You can download both the latest  DocBook XML DTD and DocBook SGML DTD from the official DocBook site at OASIS.  The examples provided in this chapter will use DocBook XML DTD. Some experimental DocBook schemas are available at sourceforge.net. 
DocBook is supported by a number of commercial and open source tools.  Easily customizable and extensible &quot;standard&quot; DocBookStylesheets are available from the DocBookOpenRepository along with the other free open source tools.
See [http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookTools DocBookTools] on the DocBook Wiki for a more complete list of commercial and open source tools.

==SGML vs XML==
The syntax of SGML and XML DTD is very similar but not identical.  The biggest difference between the DocBook DTD for SGML and the one for XML is that the SGML DTD contains SGML exclusions in some content models. 

'''Example: '''SGML DTD excludes &lt;footnote&gt; as a descendent of &lt;footnote&gt;, because it doesn't make much practical sense to have footnotes within footnotes.  XML DTDs can't contain exclusions, so if you're authoring using the DocBook XML DTD, it's possible to produce documents containing some valid-but-not-logical markup like footnotes within footnotes.

=Creating a DocBook Document=
In order to get started, you will need:
*An XML editor. Download [http://www.NetBeans.org NetBeans IDE] if you haven't done so yet.
*The DocBook XML DTD.  Although it is optional to use one, DTD's are useful when one wants to validate a document to check that it conforms to the DTD to which one claims it conforms.  Hence, the DocBook DTD can be used to validate that a purported DocBook document.  DocBook XML 4.2 is the current version of DocBook DTD. Download at the [http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/ official DocBook website]
*The DocBook XSL stylesheets are maintained primarily by Norman Walsh. There are two sets of stylesheets: XSL and DSSSL. Download the latest version XSL 1.65.1 at [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935 Sourceforge.net]
*An XSLT processor (covered in the further sections)

  &lt;sect1&gt;...&lt;/sect1&gt;
  &lt;sect1&gt;...&lt;/sect1&gt;
 &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Let’s examine the details of a typical DocBook document.  
Standard header to a DocBook XML file is a '''DocType declaration''':

&lt;small&gt;Standard header&lt;/small&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE name FORMALID &quot;Owner//Keyword Description//Language&quot;&gt;

This tells the XML manipulation tools the DTD in use. Name is the name of the root element in the document.  '''FORMALID''' is replaced with either '''PUBLIC''' or '''SYSTEM''' identifier or both.  '''PUBLIC''' identifies the DTD to which the document conforms.  '''SYSTEM''' explicitly states the location of the DTD used in the document by means of a '''URI''' (Uniform Resource Indicator).  '''PUBLIC''' identifiers are optional in XML documents although '''SYSTEM''' Identifiers are mandatory in the DOCTYPE declaration.

&lt;small&gt;Header example &lt;/small&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN&quot;
 &quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd&quot;&gt;

'''Owner:''' Oasis&lt;br&gt;
'''Keyword Description:''' DTD DocBook XML V4.2&lt;br&gt;
'''Language:''' EN - English

&lt;small&gt;'''Caution!''' If you are not online, you need to change the URL system identifier to path where DTD is installed:&lt;/small&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN&quot;
 &quot;/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.2/docbookx.dtd&quot;&gt;

=Breaking a Document into Physical Portions=
Before getting started, here is a useful tip!  For the purposes of convenience and performance, you might consider breaking a document into physical chunks and work on each chunk separately.  If you have a book that consists of three chapters and two appendixes, you might create a file called ''book.xml'', which looks like this:

&lt;small&gt;Table 6: A physically divided book, “dividedbook.xml” &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN&quot;
 [&lt;!ENTITY chap1 SYSTEM &quot;chap1.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY chap2 SYSTEM &quot;chap2.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY chap3 SYSTEM &quot;chap3.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY appa SYSTEM &quot;appa.xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY appb SYSTEM &quot;appb.xml&quot;&gt;]
 &lt;book&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;A Physically Divided Book&lt;/title&gt;
  &amp;chap1;
  &amp;chap2;
  &amp;chap3;
  &amp;appa;
  &amp;appb;
 &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

You can then write the chapters and appendixes conveniently in separate files.  This is why DocBook is well suited to large contents.  Note that these separate files do not and must not have document type declarations.

For example, Chapter 1 might begin like this: 

 &lt;chapter id=&quot;ch1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;My First Chapter&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;para&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/para&gt;…
 ……………………………………………………………

=Breaking a Document into Logical Portions=
Here is a quick reference guide for DocBook Elements: http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/ref-elements.html

There are–literally–hundreds of DocBook elements.  This is what makes docBook very powerful.  We will try to cover the major ones here and let you review the rest on your own.  Firstly, a classification; DocBook Elements can be divided broadly into these categories:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Sets
| collection of books
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Books
| books
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Divisions
| divide books into parts
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Components
| divide books or divisions into chapters
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Sections
| subdivide components
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Meta-information Elements
| contain information about other elements
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Block Elements
| occur at paragraph level
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
! Inline Elements
| used to mark up running text
|}

=Major DocBook Elements=
==Set: A collection of books==
''Set'' is the very top of the DocBook structural hierarchy. There's nothing that contains a ''Set''.

'''Some children elements:''' Book, SetIndex, SetInfo, Subtitle, Title, TitleAbbrev, ToC(table of contents).

'''Reference page:''' http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/docbook/chapter/book/set.html

&lt;small&gt;Table 7: &lt;set&gt; element, &quot;lordoftherings.xml&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE set PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN&quot;&gt;
 &lt;set&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;setinfo&gt;
   &lt;author&gt;J.R. Tolkien&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;/setinfo&gt;
  &lt;book&gt;&lt;title&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/title&gt; ... &lt;/book&gt;
  &lt;book&gt;&lt;title&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/title&gt; ... &lt;/book&gt;
  &lt;book&gt;&lt;title&gt;Return of the King&lt;/title&gt; ... &lt;/book&gt;
 &lt;set&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


==Book: A book==
A ''Book'' is probably the most common top-level element in a document.  The DocBook definition of a book is very loose and general.  It gives you free rein by not imposing a strict ordering of elements. 

'''Some children elements:'''  Appendix, Article, Bibliography, BookInfo, Chapter, Colophon, Dedication, Glossary, Index, LoT, Part, Preface, Reference, SetIndex, Subtitle, Title, TitleAbbrev, ToC.

  &lt;/bookinfo&gt;

   &lt;para&gt;This book is dedicated to MIST 7700 class of 2004 at UGA.&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/dedication&gt;

   &lt;title&gt;Forword&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;para&gt;The book aims to fulfill the need for an introductory XML
   textbook. It contains the basics of XML as well as several tools
   using XML.&lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;/preface&gt;
  &lt;chapter&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;para&gt;At least one chapter, reference, part, or article is required.&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/chapter&gt;
  &lt;appendix&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Optional Appendix&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;para&gt;Appendixes are optional but handy.&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/appendix&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


==Division: A collection of parts and references (optional)==
''Division''s are the first hierarchical level below Book.

'''Children elements:''' Part (contain components), Reference (contain RefEntrys)

==Components: Chapter-like elements of a Book or Part==
These are Preface, Chapter, Appendix, Glossary, Bibliography, and Article.  Components generally contain block elements -or sections, and some can contain navigational components and RefEntrys.

&lt;small&gt;Table 9: &lt;Bibliography&gt; element, &quot;references.xml&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/bibliomset&gt;.
  &lt;/bibliomixed&gt;
 &lt;/bibliography&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


==Sections: Several sectioning elements==

'''a. Sect1…Sect5 elements''' - the most common sectioning elements that can occur in most component-level elements.  These numbered section elements must be properly nested (Sect2s can only occur inside Sect1s, Sect3s can only occur inside Sect2s, and so on).  

'''b. Section element''' - an alternative to numbered sections
Sections are recursive, meaning that you can nest them to any depth desired.

'''c. SimpleSect element''' - a terminal section that can occur at any level
SimpleSect cannot have any other sectioning element nested within it.

'''d. BridgeHead element''' - a section title without any containing section

'''e. RefSect1…RefSect3 elements''' - numbered section elements in RefEntrys
'''f. GlossDiv, BiblioDiv, and IndexDiv elements''' - do not nest 

Please see Table 4 and Table 5 for examples.  

'''Reference page:''' http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/docbook/chapter/book/section.html

==Meta-Information Elements – contain bibliographic information==
All of the elements at the section level and above include a wrapper for meta-information about the content. Examples of meta-wrappers: BookInfo, ArticleInfo, ChapterInfo, PrefaceInfo, SetInfo, GlossaryInfo.

    &lt;/legalnotice&gt;
 &lt;/bookinfo&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Block vs. Inline Elements===

There are two classes of paragraph-level elements: ''block'' and ''inline''.

Block elements are usually presented with a paragraph break before and after them.  Most can contain other block elements, and many can contain character data and inline elements.  Examples of block elements are: Paragraphs, lists, sidebars, tables, and block quotations.

Inline elements are generally represented without any obvious breaks.  The most common distinguishing mark of inline elements is a font change, but inline elements may present no visual distinction at all.  Inline elements contain character data and possibly other inline elements, but they never contain block elements.  They are used to mark up data.  Some examples are: cross references, filenames, commands, options, subscripts and superscripts, and glossary terms.

==Block Elements - paragraph-level elements==

The block elements occur immediately below the component and sectioning elements.

===Lists===


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| &lt;b&gt;CalloutList&lt;/b&gt;
| A list of marks, frequently numbered and typically on a graphic or verbatim environment and their descriptions.

===Common block-level elements===

''Common block-level elements'' include Examples, figures, and tables.  The distinction between formal and informal elements is that formal elements have titles while informal ones do not.  

'''Example, InformalExample'''

&lt;small&gt;Table 17: &lt;example&gt; element&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE example PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN&quot;&gt;
 &lt;example&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sample code&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;programlisting&gt;print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;&lt;/programlisting&gt;
 &lt;/example&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


'''Figure, InformalFigure'''

&lt;small&gt;Table 18: &lt;figure&gt; element&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE figure PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN&quot;&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Revenues for Q1&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;mediaobject&gt;
   &lt;imageobject&gt;
    &lt;imagedata fileref=&quot;q1revenue.jpg&quot; format=&quot;JPG&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/imageobject&gt;
  &lt;/mediaobject&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


'''Table, InformalTable'''

&lt;small&gt;Table 19: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; element&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE table PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table frame=&quot;frametype&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;frame=&quot;frametype&quot;&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;tgroup cols=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;row 1, cell 1&lt;/entry&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;row 1, cell 2&lt;/entry&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;row 1, cell 3&lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;row 2, cell 1&lt;/entry&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;row 2, cell 2&lt;/entry&gt;
    &lt;entry&gt;row 3, cell 3&lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
 &lt;/tgroup&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Paragraphs===

''Paragraphs'' are Para, SimPara (simple paragraphs may not contain other block-level elements), and FormalPara (formal paragraphs have titles).  Paragraphs are the most commonly used high-level elements that can contain block elements such as itemizedlist and Mediaobject and can contain almost all inline elements.  

'''Reference page:''' http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/para.html

&lt;small&gt;Table 20: &lt;para&gt; element, &quot;Nietzsche.xml&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE para PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN&quot;&gt;
&lt;para&gt; 
 &lt;quote&gt;Behold the superfluous. They are always sick. They vomit their gall and call it a newspaper.&lt;/quote&gt; 
 -Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche,  
 &lt;citetitle&gt;Twilight of the Idols&lt;/citetitle&gt; 
&lt;/para&gt;        
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Equations===

Equation and InformalEquation (without titles)

&lt;small&gt;Table 21: &lt;informalequation&gt; element inside a &lt;para&gt; element&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE para PUBLIC &quot;-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN&quot;&gt; &lt;para&gt;
  The equation
  &lt;informalequation&gt;
   &lt;alt&gt;e^(pi*i) + 1 = 0&lt;/alt&gt;
   &lt;graphic fileref=&quot;figures/epi10&quot;&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt;
  &lt;/informalequation&gt;
is delightful because it joins together five of the most important mathematical constants.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Graphics===

InlineGraphic, MediaObject, InlineMediaObject

These elements may contain video, audio, image, and text data.  A single media object can contain several alternative forms from which the presentation system can select the most appropriate object.

Please see Table 18 for example.

==Inline Elements – used to mark up running text==

In published documents, inline elements often cause a font change or other small change, but they do not cause line or paragraph breaks.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abbrev &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;An abbreviation, especially one followed by a period.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A footnote. The location of the Footnote element identifies the location of the first reference to the footnote. Additional references to the same footnote can be inserted with FootnoteRef.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phrase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A span of text.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;A link that addresses its target by means of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;XRef&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A cross reference to another part of the document.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=Publishing a DocBook Document=

'''DSSSL vs XSL Stylesheets:'''

''Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL)'' is a stylesheet language for both print and online rendering.  It is mainly intended to work with SGML. 

''Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL)'' is a language for expressing stylesheets written in XML.  It includes the formatting object language, but refers to separate documents for the transformation language and the path language.  In this chapter, we will use XSL Stylesheets because they’re more powerful, you are already familiar with them,  and they are intended to work with XML.  

==Step 1: Get the Standard StyleSheets==

DocBook strictly separates the content and appearance of a document.  A DocBook document only explains the semantics of the document, not its formatting or appearance.  In order to publish your DocBook Document, you will need to use a set of DSSSL or XSL Stylesheets describing the formatting and an XSL processor.

If you’re thinking that it would be a lot of work to write your own XSL stylesheets, you’re right.  The good news is that you don’t need to.  There are a large number of freely available standard XSL stylesheets for DocBook maintained primarily by Norman Walsh.  

Make sure that you download the latest version of these stylesheets at [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935 Sourceforge.net - Stylesheets Repository].  The stylesheet distribution consists of a collection of modular XSL files that are assembled into several complete XSL stylesheets. There is a stylesheet for generating a single HTML file, and one for generating multiple smaller HTML files from a single DocBook document. There are stylesheets for print output, XHTML output, HTML Help output, and JavaHelp output. Since there are XSL processors for all major computer types, you can use DocBook on Unix, Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers.  By using these default stylesheets installed on your system, it is quite easy to create customized stylesheets.  But don’t forget to note that the common approach to customize the stylesheets is creating a customization layer rather than editing them directly.

==Step 2: Download an XSLT processor==

To publish HTML from your XML documents, you will need an XSLT engine.  To print, you need an XSLT engine to produce formatting objects (FO), which then must be processed with an FO engine to produce PostScript or PDF output.
A variety of XSLT engines are available.  Here's a list of some free/open-source ones you might consider.  Note that  xsltproc and Saxon are currently the only recommended XSLT engines for use with DocBook.

===XSLT Engines===

#'''Xsltproc:''' A free processor written in C, available as part of the open source libxml2 library from the Gnome development project.  It is considered the fastest of the processors, and is highly conformant to the specification.  Download at http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/ 
#'''Saxon:''' A free processor written in Java, that can be run on any operating system with a modern Java interpreter.  It uses the Aelfred XML parser internally, which has some bugs, so many people substitute the Xerces parser.  Download at http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ 
#'''Xalan:''' Xalan is part of the Apache XML Project.  It has versions written in both Java and C++, both of them free.  The Java version is highly portable and more fully developed.  Generally Xalan is used with the Xerces XML parser (Java or C++), also available from the Apache XML Project.  Download at http://xml.apache.org/ 

Your choice of an XSLT engine may depend a lot on the environment in which you'll be running the engine.  Many DocBook users who need or want a non-Java application use xsltproc.  It's very fast and the developers respond very quickly to bug reports and questions.  But one current limitation xsltproc has is that it doesn't yet support Norm Walsh's DocBook-specific XSLT extension functions.

Saxon is the most popular one for use in a Java environment.  It also supports Norm Walsh's DocBook-specific XSLT extension functions. 

''NetBeans IDE'', the XML editor we’ve been using for other chapters’ exercises, has a built-in XSLT processor using the XALAN parser by default.  NetBeans IDE not only lets you validate your XML documents but also does XSL transformations right there in the IDE.  It will work for this chapter’s purpose well enough.  It doesn’t provide any XSLT debugging though, so you might want to get yourself a decent XSL IDE (e.g.,XML Spy or Xcelerator) for serious XSLT work.

===FO Engines===
For generating print/PDF output from FO files, there are two free/open-source FO engines: 
#'''PassiveTeX:''' available at http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Software/passivetex/index.xml.ID=body.1_div.1.  Download and installation information at http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Software/passivetex/index.xml.ID=body.1_div.3.
#'''FOP:''' a Java-based processor from the Apache XML Project, available at http://xml.apache.org/fop/

==Step 3: Customize the XSL stylesheets==

===Output to HTML===
*The main strength of standard stylesheets is that they are easily customizable.
*Parameters found in params.xsl 
*Call your customization layer instead of the standard stylesheet

&lt;small&gt;Table 22: A customized XSL stylesheet, &quot;myxsl1.xsl&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
   &lt;!-- Customization layer --&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
   &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- Use 'chunk.xsl' in line below to chunk files. --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;xsl:import href=&quot;/usr/share/sgml/docbook/docbook-xsl-1.51.1/html/docbook.xsl&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;chapter.autolabel&quot; select=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;section.autolabel&quot; select=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;section.label.includes.component.label&quot; select=&quot;1&quot;
 doc:type=&quot;boolean&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;!-- Insert more parameters here. --&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


*Beyond setting parameters, you can modify XSLT &quot;templates&quot; to override default behavior
*You need at least a minimal knowledge of XSLT

&lt;small&gt;Table 23: A customized XSL stylesheet, &quot;myxsl2.xsl&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
 &lt;xsl:when test=&quot;(@role='strong') or (@role='bold')&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;inline.boldseq&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
 &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
   &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;inline.italicseq&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


===Output to PDF===

It generally requires a two-stage process:
#Generation of FO from XML 
#Generation of PDF from FO 

&lt;small&gt;Table 24: An XSL stylesheet to generate FO, &quot;myxsl3.xsl&quot;&lt;/small&gt;
 xsltproc -o sample.fo  $DB/fo/docbook.xsl sample.xml
 fop.sh -fo sample.fo -pdf sample.pdf

    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;para&gt; This website demonstrates the DocBook.&lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;webtoc/&gt;
        &lt;section&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;What is a Website?&lt;/title&gt;
               &lt;para&gt;A website is a collection of pages organized, for the purposes of navigation, into one or more hierarchies. In Website, each page is a separate XML document authored according to the Website DTD, a customization of &lt;ulink url=&quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/&quot;&gt;DocBook&lt;/ulink&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/webpage&gt;  
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


=Why use DocBook?=

This certainly looks like too much work, doesn’t it?  You’re not wrong.  Why do we bother to use DocBook then?

*It is portable! A document written in DocBook markup can be converted into HTML, PostScript, PDF, RTF, DVI, plain ASCII text easily and quickly without any expensive tools.

*It is flexible! It enables output to multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, Slides, and many others.

*It separates the content from format! DocBook is only concerned with the structure of a document.  It frees the author from worrying about the formatting and layout of a document.

*It is easy to understand! Most of DocBook elements are self explanatory.

*It can handle large quantities of content. You can physically divide the document into different files and work on them separately and conveniently. 

*It is free! There a lot of freely available open source tools used to work with DocBook. 

DocBook is well suited to any collection of technical documentation that is regularly maintained and published.  Multiple authors can contribute to a single document, and their content can easily be merged because all the authors are using a highly structured, standard markup language.  Just one little point to keep in mind; because the formatting for DocBook documents is strictly accomplished by stylesheets, DocBook is not well matched to highly designed layout-driven content like magazines.

Setting up a DocBook system will certainly take some time and effort. The payoff will be an efficient, flexible, and inexpensive publishing system that is iterative and that can grow with your needs.  Therefore, it is worth the effort!

=DocBook Filters - Reading and Writing DocBook XML Using OpenOffice.org=
The goal of the project is to use OpenOffice.org as a WYSIWYG editor of XML content to edit structured documents using styles.  When exported, these styles are then transformed to XML tags.
This section shows you how to enable and use DocBook filters.  Below are some links to stylesheets that can be download to use the latest transformations. 
==Enabling the DocBook XSLT's in OpenOffice.org 1.1 Beta 2/RC==
There are three different ways to enable the DocBook filters. 
#Download the DocBook XSLT Stylesheets and OpenOffice.org Style Template
#*Using this method will make certain that the most recent stylesheets and OpenOffice.org style template will be used for import and export.  It is required to download the following to import, export and modify DocBook documents in OpenOffice.org:

Using OpenOffice.org styles to represent DocBook tags
The style template supplies all of the custom styles that are currently supported. Once a DocBook document has been imported to OpenOffice.org, the available DocBook specific styles can be viewed using the Stylist. On import, each of the supported DocBook tags will be mapped to formatted OpenOffice.org content. Similarly, to modify the imported DocBook document, OpenOffice.org text styles can be used to represent the DocBook tags marking-up the text. 
NOTE: A new DocBook document can be created in OpenOffice.org by opening the DocBookTemplate.stw. The document can then be saved as a DocBook document, and the new content will be represented as DocBook mark-up. 
How to create new DocBook content: 
*Press F11 to display the Stylist 
*Select Custom Styles in the Stylist combo-box 
*Click the Character Styles icon (second from left on the Stylist) 
*Double-click the SubScript style 
*Enter text in the OpenOffice.org document 
*On exporting as DocBook, the text formatted as the SubScript custom style will be marked-up with the DocBook tag &lt;subscript&gt; 
How to create DocBook sections: 
Initially the DocBook project used OpenOffice.org sections to enforce the nesting of DocBook sections. Feedback has shown that authors wish to use the common word processing styles such as Heading1, Heading2, etc. The following instructions describe how to create a &lt;sect1&gt; that contains a &lt;sect2&gt; 
*Press F11 to display the Stylist 
*Select All Styles in the Stylist combo-box 
*Click the Paragraph Styles icon (first in the left on the Stylist) 
*Double-click the Heading 1 style 
*Enter the text to be the &lt;sect1&gt; title 
*All the text below this heading will now be the content of the DocBook &lt;sect1&gt; 
*Enter other DocBook styles, tables, etc. 
*Enter other DocBook styles, tables, etc. to be included in &lt;sect1&gt; 
#Double-click the Heading 2 style 
#Enter the text to be the &lt;sect2&gt; title 
#All the text below this heading will now be the content of the DocBook &lt;sect2&gt; 
#Enter other DocBook styles, tables, etc. to be included in &lt;sect2&gt; 
*This nesting of DocBook sect's using OpenOffice headings can go as far as &lt;sect4&gt; / Heading 4 
Navigating through the document:
If you wish to see how DocBook sections are nested as OpenOffice.org headings, use the F5 key to Display the Navigator window. Expand the headings tag, to display the layout of the headings within the document. You can skip to the start of a given DocBook section/OpenOffice.org heading, by double-clicking on it.

This is a document for everyday use of electricity in a household.
Many circuits are a mixture of electrical, mechanical, and electronic components, which interact in different ways to produce strange and useful effects. Topics include commercially generated AC as well as AC generated from inverters for alternative power use (such as off-the-grid homes, cabins or recreational vehicles.) Electricity has become an integral part of life and difficult to imagine to be without it.

== Distribution and Domestic Power Supply ==

                                                                                                                                             


Alternating Current is used for electric power distribution because it can easily be transformed to a higher or lower voltage.     Electrical energy losses are dependent on current flow. By using transformers, the voltage can be stepped up so that the same amount of power may be distributed over long distances at lower currents and hence lower losses due to the resistance of the conductors. The voltage can also be stepped down again so it is safe for domestic supply. 

Three-phase electrical generation and transmission is common and is an efficient use of conductors as the current-rating of each conductor can be fully utilized in transporting power from generation through transmission and distribution to final use. Three-phase electricity is supplied only in industrial premises and many industrial electric motors are designed for it. Three voltage waveforms are generated that are 120 degrees out of phase with each other. At the load end of the circuit the return legs of the three phase circuits can be coupled together at a 'neutral point', where the three currents sum to zero if supplied to a balanced load. This means that all the current can be carried using only three cables, rather than the six that would otherwise be needed. Three phase power is a type of ''polyphase'' system.

In most situations only a single phase is needed to supply street lights or residential consumers. When distributing three-phase electric power, a fourth or neutral cable is run in the street distribution to provide one complete circuit to each house. Different houses in the street are placed on different phases of the supply so that the ''load is balanced'', or spread evenly, across the three phases when consumers are connected. Thus the supply cable to each house can consist of a live and neutral conductor with possibly an earthed armoured sheath. In North America, the most common technique is to use a transformer to convert one distribution phase to a center-tapped 'split-phase' 240V winding; the connection to the consumer is typically two 120-volt power lines out of phase with each other, and a grounded 'neutral' wire, which also acts as the physical support wire. In India there is a recent trend of providing a High Voltage line up to the residence &amp; then stepping it down to domestic power on premises to avoid pilferage of the Energy. Although this method has certain advantages, there are obvious potential dangers associated with it.

The use of &quot;split phase&quot; power, two 120-volt power lines out of phase with each other, as described above, allows high-powered appliances to be run on 240V, thus decreasing the amount of current required per phase, while allowing the rest of the residence to be wired for the safer 120V. For example, a clothes dryer may need 3600W of power, which translates to a circuit rating of 30A at 120V. If the dryer can instead be run on  240V, the service required is only 15A. Granted, you would then need two 15A circuit breakers, one for each side of the circuit, and you would need to provide two 'hot' lines, one neutral, and a ground in the distribution wiring, but that is offset by the lower cost of the wires for the lower current. Houses are generally wired so that the two phases are loaded about equally; connecting the high-power appliances such as clothes dryers, kitchen ranges, and built-in space heaters across both phases helps to ensure that the loads will remain balanced across the two phases.

For safety, a third wire is often connected between the individual electrical appliances in the house and the main electric switchboard or fusebox. The third wire is known in Britain and most other English-speaking countries as the ''earth wire'', whereas in North America it is the ''ground wire''. At the main switchboard the earth wire is connected to the neutral wire and also connected to an earth stake or other convenient earthing point (to Americans, the ''grounding point'') such as a water pipe. In the event of a fault, the earth wire can carry enough current to blow a fuse and isolate the faulty circuit. The earth connection also means that the surrounding building is at the same voltage as the neutral point. The most common form of electrical shock occurs when a person accidentally forms a circuit between a live conductor and ground. A ''residual-current circuit breaker'' (also called a Ground Fault Interrupter, GFI, or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, GFCI) is designed to detect such a problem and break the circuit before electric shock causes death. As many parts of the neutral system are connected to the earth, balancing currents, known as ''earth currents'', may flow between the distribution transformer and the consumer and other parts of the system, which are also earthed, this acts to keep the neutral voltage at a safe level. This system of earthing the neutral points to balance the current flows for safety reasons is known as a ''multiple earth neutral system''.

=== Overcurrent protection ===
In households circuit breakers or fuses are used to switch off the supply of electricity quickly if the [[current]] is too large, for example there is a limit of 15 Amperes in a normal 115/120 Volt circuit.

:In distribution systems automatic protection is used for the same purpose. There may be two stages:
*A very fast disconnection if the problem causing the overcurrent condition is nearby, and 
*A time-delayed backup operation if the overcurrent originates outside the local area. 

Unfortunately in some cases this 'protection' can have a cascading effect, because the switching-off of one circuit can lead to an overload of adjacent circuits that may switch off later. &quot;Blackouts&quot; can be the result if further failures occur. 

:There is also the problem of a power source thereby becoming disconnected from its load, causing disruption to generation and altering the balance between the amount of power needed and the amount of power available in many parts of, or the entire system.
The amount of time taken to restore generation and reestablish that balance depends on the type of generation (thermal, hydroelectric. nuclear or other) available, - after a &quot;blackout&quot; it can take many hours to restore the system.

== Single phase electric power ==

The generation of AC electric power is commonly ''three phase'', in which the waveforms of three supply conductors are offset from one another by 120&amp;deg;. The design of the power generators has three sets of coils placed 120 degrees apart rotating in a magnetic field. This creates three separate sine waves of electricity that are displaced from each other in time by 120 degrees of rotation (1/3 of a circle). Standard frequencies of rotation are either 50 Hertz (cycles per second) in Europe or 60 Hertz in North America. The voltage across any pair of these three conductors, or between a single conductor and ground (in a grounded system) is what is known as &quot;single phase&quot; electric power. ''Single phase'' power is what is commonly available to residential and light-commercial consumers in most distribution power grids. In North America, the single phase that is supplied is developed across a transformer coil at the utility pole (for aerial drop) or transformer pad (for underground) distribution. This single coil is center tapped and the tap is grounded to develop two waveforms that are 180 degrees out of phase with each other with 1/2 the voltage. This then creates a 120/240 volt system that is delivered to the customer. The voltage from either side of the coil to the center tap (ground) is 120 volts whereas the voltage between the two conductors on either end of the coil develops the full voltage of 240 volts.

== Inverters and Battery Based AC ==

An ''inverter'' is a circuit for converting direct current to alternating current. An inverter can have one or two switched-mode power supplies (SMPS).

Early inverters consisted of an oscillator driving a transistor as an on/off switch, that is used to interrupt the incoming direct current to create a square wave. This is then fed through a transformer to smooth the square wave into a sine wave and to produce the required output voltage.

More efficient inverters use various methods to produce an approximate sine wave at the transformer input rather than relying on the transformer to smooth it. Capacitors can be used to smooth the flow of current into and out of the transformer. It is also possible to produce a more sinusoidal wave by having split-rail direct current inputs at two voltages, (positive and negative inputs with a central ground). By connecting the transformer input terminals in a timed sequence between the positive rail and ground, the positive rail and the negative rail, the ground rail and the negative rail, then both to the ground rail, a 'stepped sinusoid' is generated at the transformer input and the current drain on the direct current supply is less variable.

''Modified Sine Wave inverters'' convert the (usually 12 V DC) battery voltage to high frequency (20 kHz) AC, so that a smaller transformer can be used for stepping up to a higher voltage (say 160 V) AC.
This output is converted to DC at the same voltage, and then inverted again to a quasi sine wave output (about 120 V RMS).
A disadvantage of the modified sine wave inverters is that the output voltage depends on the battery voltage.

It is quite difficult to obtain a good sine wave from an inverter.
The quoted accuracy (''harmonic distortion'') for most is less than 60%, and will have an effect on the appliances connected to the output of the inverter.
This ''might'' mean noisy operation in some appliances and/or damaged electric motors, because they will run less efficiently and could overheat.
High end inverters (&gt; $2,000) produce waveforms which are closer to the sine wave produced by a utility.

=== Batteries ===

Most home systems use conventional lead acid batteries for storage.
They are cheap, and are deep cycle batteries, ''i.e.'', they can be discharged completely and charged again many times.
You cannot use automobile batteries in inverters, as they are only used to provide a large starting current, and are not meant to be discharged completely.
The lead acid batteries have the disadvantage that they have to be replenished with distilled water every few months, and if it dries out, it cannot be repaired. However, they can provide the large surge currents which are required by many loads (such as induction motors) which may be connected to the system.

== Switched Mode Power Supply ==
{{wikipedia|DC to DC converter}}

A ''switched-mode power supply'', or SMPS or switching regulator, is an electronic power supply circuit that attempts to produce a smoothed, constant-voltage, output from a varying input voltage.

Switched-mode power supplies may be designed to convert from alternating current or direct current, or both. They generally output direct current, although an inverter is technically a switched-mode power supply.

Switched-mode power supplies operate by using an inverter to convert the input direct current supply to alternating current, usually at around 20 kHz. If the input is alternating current but at a lower frequency (such as 50 Hz or 60 Hz line power) then an inverter is still used to bump the frequency up.

This high frequency means that the output transformer of the inverter will operate more efficiently than if it were run at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to hysteresis in the transformer core, and the transformer will not need to be as large or heavy. This high-frequency output is then fed through a rectifier to produce the output direct current.

Regulation is achieved through feedback. The output voltage is compared to a reference voltage and the result used to alter the switching frequency or duty cycle of the inverter oscillator, which affects its output voltage.

Switched-mode PSUs in domestic products such as personal computers often have universal inputs, meaning that they can accept power from most mains supplies throughout the world, with frequencies from 50 Hz to 60 Hz and voltages from 100 V to 240 V.

Unlike most other appliances, switched mode power supplies tend to be constant power devices, drawing more current as the line voltage reduces. This may cause stability problems in some situations such as emergency generator systems.

Also, maximum current draw occurs at the peaks of the waveform cycle. This means that basic switched mode power supplies tend to produce more harmonics and have a worse power factor than other types of appliances.
However, higher-quality switched-mode power supplies with power-factor correction (PFC) are available, which are designed to present close to a resistive load to the mains.

The term power factor with respect to switched-mode supplies is misleading as it doesn't have much to do with leading or lagging voltage, but the way in which it loads the circuit (''i.e.'' only at certain points in the cycle).

There are several types of switched-mode power supplies, classified according to the circuit topology.

# buck regulator (single inductor; output voltage &lt; input voltage)
# boost regulator (single inductor; output voltage &gt; input voltage)
# buckboost regulator (single inductor; output voltage can be more or less than the input voltage)
# flyback regulator (uses output transformer; allows multiple outputs and input-to-output isolation)
# forward regulator (uses output transformer; allows multiple outputs and input-to-output isolation)
# Cuk converter (uses a capacitor for energy storage; produces negative voltage for positive input)

== Major Classes of Appliances ==

===  Single-Phase AC motors ===

The most common single-phase motor is the shaded-pole synchronous motor, which is most commonly used in devices requiring lower torque such as electric fans, microwave ovens and other small household appliances.

Another common single-phase AC motor is the induction motor, commonly used in major appliances such as washing machines and clothes dryers. These motors can generally provide greater starting torque by using a special startup winding in conjunction with a starting capacitor and a centrifugal switch. When starting, the capacitor and special winding are temporarily connected to the power source and provide starting torque. Once the motor reaches speed, the centrifugal switch disconnects the capacitor and startup winding.

=== Shaded-pole synchronous motor ===

Shaded-pole synchronous motors are a class of AC motor that uses single phase electric power to convert electric power to mechanical energy. They work by using a squirrel-cage rotor and a split stator that has copper shorting rings placed on it so as to shade a portion of the stator's magnetic field enough to provide starting torque.

The number of poles in an induction motor is an important factor in its interaction with non sine wave input.
As a rule of thumb, motors with larger number of poles are more sensitive to harmonic distortion.

=== Incandescent Lamps ===

Early applications of lighting was using lamps which used a heated filament to provide light.
The filament was made of tungsten and was placed inside a near vacuum glass enclosure.
While it was cheap, it produced a lot of heat, so that it was inefficient too.
Note that the incandescent bulb is a purely resistive load (power factor 1).

==== Inrush Current ====
{{wikipedia|inrush current}}

The incandescent bulb is designed to operate at high temperatures. At normal operating temperatures, a tungsten filament has a resistance nearly 20 times its room-temperature resistance. So when a bulb is turned on, it draws a current nearly 20 times the normal current until it warms up. This current surge is called the ''inrush current'', which lasts for 30-100 milliseconds.
Again, something different from the &quot;dumb load&quot; point of view.
Thus, 5 100 W bulbs in parallel, which would consume just 500 W in normal circumstances, will have a inrush load of more than 10000 W.
More importantly, a huge current flows, and it is important that all components on the line can carry the current.
For larger lamps, a small current flows to keep it at a reasonable temperature, called the &quot;keep alive&quot;.

==== Evaporation ====

Another factor often overlooked in lamps is the resistance vs. time values.
For an incandescent lamp, the power is proportional to the area.
The tungsten slowly evaporates as the bulb ages, so that the power (and hence the light) produced by the lamp drops.
Further, the light drops at about 5 times the rate of the power drop, so that the lamp becomes very inefficient with age.

After running for 75% of its rated life, an incandescent lamp must produce more than 93% of its initial light output in order to pass the standard test described in IEC Publication 60064.

==== Voltage and Efficiency ====
{{wikipedia|incandescent light bulb#Voltage, light output, and lifetime}}

The efficiency of an incandescent lamp is measured in terms of the amount of light produced per watt of power consumed.
As the temperature of the lamp decreases, the light output per watt decreases.
Thus, at a lower voltage (brownout), the efficiency of the lamp is very low.

* saying that the efficiency is &quot;very low&quot; is purely subjective - &quot;very low&quot; compared to what?


The tungsten filament normal operating temperature is selected to minimize the net cost of running lighting fixtures, balancing efficiency and lifetime.
Hotter filament temperatures cost more because they wear out the filament faster and require more frequent replacements.
Colder filament temperatures cost more because they require more electrical power for a given amount of visible light.

The luminous efficiency of any black-body radiator increases with temperature up to 6300 °C (6600 K or 11,500 °F).
Tungsten melts at 3695 K (6192°F), where it, like any black-body radiator, would theoretically have a luminous efficiency of 52 lumens per watt.

A 50-hour-life projection bulb is designed to operate at 50 °C (90 °F) below that melting point, where it may achieve up to 22 lumens/watt.

A 1000 hour lifespan general service bulb typically operates at 2000 K to 3300 K (about 3100-5400°F), achieving 10 to 17 lumens/watt{{fact}}.
As you increase the voltage V of an incandescent light bulb,
the incandescent bulb puts out more light -- proportional to the fourth power of V --
but the life of the incandescent bulb is then decreased by the eighth power of V.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluorescent Lamps ===

The tungsten lamp has been replaced in most applications by fluorescent lamps.
Fluorescent lamps have a power factor close to 0.25.
Fluorescent lamps typically rate about 40 W, and they provide much more (about 5 times) light compared to an incandescent lamp of the same wattage. They also give out less heat.

==== Passive Control ====

Early fluorescent lamps used a ballast (also called a choke coil), which was essentially an inductor to control the current in the lamp.
Also, the lamp was started by using a starter, which is essentially a neon thermistor which heats up and closes a circuit.
With the choke coil in series with it, the lamp has a relatively small voltage drop across it so that the starter doesn't close again.
As the starter is in parallel with the lamp, the same starter can be used to start several lamps.
One particularly annoying aspect of the electromagnetic ballast is the 60 Hz flicker produced.
While it does not bother most people, some find it extremely irritating.
Also, the electromagnetic ballast increases power consumption by about 25% when on utility power.

==== Active (Electronic) Control ====

Modern lamps use electronic circuits to control the current, so that both the starter and the choke coil are redundant, and they behave much better on both inverter based and utility power.
Many electronic ballasts will boost the frequency to something in the range of 20 kHz, so that there is no flicker problem.

=== CRT Based Appliances ===

The other major source of power consumption are CRTs (Cathode Ray Tubes) like computer monitors and televisions.

=== Computer Towers ===

The towers of a modern computer draw their power from a [[#Switched Mode Power Supply|SMPS]], which has been detailed below.
The most popular computers today (running P4s and 3D cards) consume several hundred watts of power.

=== Other Electronic Loads ===

Other electronic items in a household draw their power from the mains using a wall wart.
The steady state power consumed by each component is pretty low, and in many cases (like printers, scanners etc.), they don't work continuously.

== Control Elements ==

Control elements are the switches, dimmers, and regulators which are connected to the circuit.
They are, by their very nature non linear elements and their behavior is quite complicated, and not quite well represented by their simple schematic symbols.

=== Light Dimmers ===

Light dimmers work by cutting off parts of the input sine wave.
While this works for resistive loads, even here it has side effects.

== Energy Meters ==

Most households are on the grid, ''i.e.'' their electricity comes from a utility, which installs an energy meter on the premises.
The meter is then read either manually or by phone line connection to the utility offices.

The utility wants your power factor to be as close to 1 as possible, and businesses are penalized if they cannot achieve a target set by the utility, as the transmission losses are nearly the same for both active and reactive power consumed.
For home users no such rule exists, and it is interesting to see the changes in the power consumption patterns now that most of the home electricity use is not lighting, and even the lighting is by fluorescent lamps which are not resistive in nature.
The utility only charges the home uses for active power, so that a low power factor is not an issue from an economic perspective, and transmission losses within the household are negligible.


=== Mechanical Energy Meters ===

Mechanical energy meters are discussed in high school physics books as applications of ''Lenz's law'', ''viz.'', the generation of eddy currents which oppose the change that caused it.
The number of revolutions of a metal disc between the poles of an electromagnet represents the amount of energy consumed.
They are more accurately described as electro-mechanical meters, as they use mechanical components like a spinning disc to measure the energy consumed.

=== Electronic Energy Meters ===

Electronic meters work by measuring the current flowing through the resistors in it at any time.
The unit of measurement in the meter is the number of pulses, which is the smallest unit of energy measured by the meter.
The pulses are calibrated in terms of kilowatt-hours of electricity, typically 3200 pulses per unit.
Apart from the numbered wheel display found in mechanical meters, the energy consumed is also noted inside chips in the meter, so tampering can be detected.

== Lightning ==

Lightning is a very major cause for concern for a home user.
Lightning consists of an immense current source which discharges itself through anything it can find.
Proper lightning control and defense is very tricky, and improper methods can increase the risk to man and machine.

A simple lightning arrestor consists of a choke which is in series with the loads.
A spark gap which is grounded runs parallel.
When lightning strikes, the pulse is almost a square wave, and the choke acts as a large resistance.
At the same time, the large voltage generated causes the air to break down across the spark gap, and it acts as a short,

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The terms '''lead guitar''' and '''rhythm guitar''' are mildly confusing, especially to the beginner. Of course, a guitar should almost always follow some sort of rhythm, whether loose or tight. Plus, many times, guitars are very prominent in a song, where it drives the music, but it's not quite lead. Plus, the lead guitarist doesn't even play a lead part, and that happens almost all the time! How can we untangle this mess?

The distinction is somewhat arbitrary. Many bands in contemporary music have two guitarists, where usually one would specialize in &quot;lead&quot; and the other in &quot;rhythm&quot;. [[w:The Beatles|The Beatles]], [[w:Metalocalypse|Dethklok]], and [[w:Metallica|Metallica]] are examples of bands who use this combination. Lead guitar means melody guitar, meaning that the lead guitarist must specialize in playing the melody of the song, so any guitar playing a solo is not a lead. Sure, a lead guitarist may get to solo, but someone cannot be called a lead guitarist simply because he/she plays a solo in a song. A lead part contributes entirely to melody (as lead guitar means melody guitar), instead of to the foundation, which is carried by the rhythm guitar. This means the rhythm guitarist is the driving source. Lead guitar uses few or no chords, although sometimes it can be following a chord structure, while rhythm guitar uses the chords to drive the music.

It is important to realize that lead guitar and rhythm guitar fit into two different parts of a band, but it just happens that they are played on the same instrument. Lead guitar provides a solo voice, and is grouped with the lead vocals, lead piano, etc. Rhythm guitar is part of the underlying rhythm section, along with instruments like bass, drums, sometimes piano, background vocals, etc. Generally speaking, the rhythm provides the groove of the song, while lead provides the melody.

However, these distinctions get fuzzy, especially when the so-called lead guitarists play chords and double-stops in their riffs. In some cases, a single guitar part provides both the melody and accompaniment (especially [[Guitar/Double-stops and Power Chords|power chord riffs]], commonly found in rock and metal, and [[Guitar/Picking and Plucking|finger picking]], found in [[Guitar/Folk Guitar|folk guitar]]).

Some bands (often three piece bands) feature a single guitarist who can act as either, by either assuming one role at a time or, in a recording studio, recording a lead track over their own rhythm track. For example, the band [[w:Dire Straits|Dire Straits]] has been in both situations: in the early days, David Knopfler played rhythm while Mark Knopfler played lead. When David left, Mark usually played both parts on studio albums, and hired another guitarist to play rhythm for live shows. Some guitarists reached such technical proficiency that they were able to play both parts &quot;simultaneously&quot;. A famous example of this technique is [[w:Dimebag Darrell|Dimebag Darrell]], particularly on songs such like [[w:Walk (Pantera song)|Walk]] or [[w:New Found Power|Breathing New Life]] (using an harmonizing effect pedal).

==Playing Lead Guitar==
Very often, a lead guitar part is played on an electric guitar, using moderate to heavy distortion (also known as drive). For this reason, many amplifier manufacturers refer to their distortion channel as a lead channel. Distortion provides a more powerful sustain than a clean channel, and this is often best represented in extreme techniques like shredding and tapping, which some guitarists feel can only properly be done with distortion. Of course, lead guitar can be played on an acoustic guitar, but some techniques may not be as pronounced as on an electric.

The most common techniques for creating lead parts are [[Guitar/Bending and Vibrato|bending, vibrato]] and [[Guitar/Slides|slides]]. These provide the basic means of emphasizing notes, and allow for greater expression in the melody. Often the lead guitarists may employ [[Guitar/Arpeggios and Sweep Picking|arpeggios or sweep picking]] to add depth, and the progression of the solo often mirrors the underlying rhythm guitar part.

==Playing Rhythm Guitar==
Rhythm guitar is characterized mostly by playing chords in patterns. Some players criticize rhythm guitar as sounding &quot;chordy&quot;, or not being as interesting as the lead part. Although rhythm guitar does not &quot;express&quot; as much as the lead guitar, there is so much to be learned about [[Guitar/Chords|chords]], [[Guitar/Chord Progressions|chord progressions]] and [[Guitar/Rhythm|rhythm patterns]], and a player is limited only by their imagination.

Rhythm guitar is just as easily played on electric or acoustic, clean or distorted. The technique is less about expressing individual notes, and more about choosing chords or chord voicings that enrich the overall sound, which may add its own expressive tone to the music.

==A few assumptions==

Visual Language interpreters may be found in nearly every part of public life, and so it is expected that those who look as this text will hardly be approaching without some opinion and background knowledge. Opinions and backgrounds vary widely, however, so it makes sense to outline the assumptions made by the authors of this book with respect to its readership.

===What this book is for===

This book is written for those with a strong interest in interpreting where at least one of the languages is visual (more on that below). Many of the readers will probably be on the cusp or in the process of formal education to become an interpreter. Others may be consumers of interpreting services who wish to have a greater appreciation and understanding of the interpreter's task. 

The expectation is that most readers will know at least one visual language, in addition to a spoken language. For those wishing to become interpreters, it is expected that command of the spoken and visual languages will approach that of an educated native speaker; if there are any deficiencies in either language, it is vital for potential interpreters to make the necessary effort to ameliorate any problems.

===What this book is ''not'' for===

There was a time in the not-too-distant past when there were no courses on interpreting, no textbooks, no linguistic research.  But there were still interpreters.  So it is possible to be an interpreter and a skilled one without any hint of formal training.  But what is possible is not always what is best, and in this case it is possible to be an interpreter without training in the way that it is possible to row a small boat across an ocean.  The benefits of formal training outweigh any cost, and the cost of avoiding formal training are not paid for by any benefit.

Neither this nor any other book can be used as a substitute for a serious multi-year course of instruction by experts skilled both in the art interpretation and in the art of of teaching the art. Interpreting is not a &quot;teach-it-yourself&quot; occupation; the more experienced eyes are on you, the more feedback and instruction you receive, the greater the chanced that you will excel.

This is also not a textbook on a visual language. Although many examples of proper translations of sentences into visual languages (notably [[en:American_Sign_Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] are given, these are given in the context of the interpreting process. Natural conversation in a language is a qualitatively different cognitive task, and the two should not be confused.

There are setting when communication occurs in a visual medium, such as underwater among SCUBA divers or in a military/police operation.  This is not a book about interpreting those situations.

==Why &quot;Visual Language?&quot;==

Given the fact that interpreters typically work between a spoken and a signed language, the term ''visual language'' may seem unnecessarily convoluted. Why not &quot;sign language interpreting&quot; or &quot;interpreting for the deaf?&quot; 

The short answer (which will be elaborated on in the following chapters) is that such interpreting is not simply for those who are [[en:deaf|deaf]] (''Note:'' following common convention, ''Deaf'' is capitalized when referring to members of a linguistic and cultural group which uses a [[en:sign_language|signed language]] as the first language). Not only does this piece of verbal legerdemain place the deaf in the position of being helpless, it ignores the fact that in situations where there are deaf and hearing consumers of interpreting services, ''both'' sides are in need of such services. In fact, there are situations in which both consumers are hearing, but one may have a disorder such as an [[en:aphasia|aphasia]] which necessitates the use of a visual language.

Furthermore, not all visual languages are signed languages. There are systems such as [[en:cued_speech|Cued Speech]] which, although they do not qualify as signed languages, are used under same circumstances as those encountered by sign language interpreters. For this reason, this book uses ''visual language'', a decision which mirrors that of bodies such as the [http://www.avlic.ca/ Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada]. 

==A history of the field==

==&quot;Field&quot; or &quot;Profession?&quot;==

It is often said that visual language interpreting is a [[en:profession|profession]], and many interpreters, when discussing professional practices compare interpreting to law, medicine, or another field of endeavor within the same societal rank. 

Others agree that while that is a worthy goal, a profession has a complicated body of knowledge which takes years to master. Interpreting certainly is a complex and demanding task which is acquired on the order of years; the best interpreters are still learning. Still, there is no broad agreement on how that knowledge is to be effectively transmitted. Furthermore, the level of [[en:Post-secondary_education|education]] is still a matter hotly debated within the profession. The [http://www.rid.org Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID)] has recently passed a motion phasing in a degree requirement in the coming decade: first an associate's degree then a bachelor's degree will be required. There are also indications of growing pains in other areas which, the argument goes, are signs that visual language interpreting is not yet a profession in the strict sense.

Still others assert that aspiring to professional status is elitist, and that visual language interpreting has done fine without being in such highfalutin' company as the learned professions. Furthermore, they would argue, formal education is no guarantee of quality, and to pretend to do so ignores current facts on the ground. Many interpreters are &quot;home-grown&quot;, and provide superior service. To them, interpreting is a trade, learned by long apprenticeship, but not necessarily in a college classroom.

Each of these viewpoints (and others) have powerful arguments both for and against them, and many of the authors of this text will hold to one or another of these views. In the interests of harmony, and while the debate is still far from concluded, this textbook will use the more neutral term ''field'', which may be applied equally to medicine and cosmetology. 

==Credentials==



==Conventions Used in this Book== 

Since sections of this book will be concerned with a particular brand of visual language, namely [[en:American Sign Language|ASL]], there are times when it will be necessary to represent utterances in that language. To that end, every effort will be made to include videos and illustrations as needed. However, sometimes the use of glosses will suffice, and standard glossing conventions as found in most standard ASL textbooks and research journals will be used. The glosses will be written in the format given below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction==

This work is addressed to all students who aim to practice in the fields - both vast and closed - of social psychology, psychological education, pedagogy, or other psychologies; that is to say, in any domain where the &quot;rules of psychology&quot; hold sway. Hence, this work will also interest a neophyte with any interest in psychology.

De nombreux métiers, surtout récents, cherchent à se distinguer par un hermétisme de leur code linguistique, et c'est largement le cas dans le champ professionnel désigné ci-dessus. Le langage «psy» est l'apanage des professionnels « initiés» et les démarque des autres interlocuteurs pourtant de plus en plus nombreux dans ce domaine. Si l'on souhaite que « le fait psychologique » soit considéré comme un outil, et comme l'outil le plus efficace dont nous disposions dans notre domaine professionnel, il faut lui ôter son côté hermétique et expliquer clairement ce que nous savons avec certitude, ce que nous savons par intuition et ce que nous devons soumettre à des études plus approfondies pour intégrer tel ou tel fait dans le corpus des connaissances établies.

The goal of this work is twofold: on the one hand, to describe as clearly as possible the present state of our knowledge in the field of '''child and adolescent psychology''', and on the other, to allow future teachers, educators of young children, psychiatric teaching assistants[?aides médico-pédagogiques], etc., to further[?faire le point sur] their knowledge.

This book comprises three parts:

* '''The first part''', dedicated to the introduction, details the history of child psychology (and situates it with respect to several related and descendant fields);

* '''The second part''' presents the content matter of the subject, in the form of questions that announce the discussion of an important point or that permit the recapitulation of a subchapter. The key terms and the important names in psychoanalysis and psychology are written in the margin in order to help the reader in his studies;

* '''The third part''' comprises:

#a bibliography of reference works;
#the assembled questions, by chapter;
#the biographies of several authors;
#a lexicon;
#[?des annales (avec des propositions de corrigés).]

With this book, the reader can always find:
* the exact point he wants to study;
* the theory of a particular psychologist;
* the answer to a question he has;
* practice for his exam.

If this book manages to accomplish these goals and, moreover, to transmit even a little of [?un tant soit peu] the pleasure of understanding, for example, what goes on when a child plays in front of our eyes or seeks to grasp a kind of reasoning up to that time unknown, if the reader (in addition to everything mentioned above) could sense the complexity - under the apparent simplicity - of these &quot;human adventures,&quot; the goal of this work would be achieved.

Thanks to those who began this project!
[[User:William Trevor Blake|Trevor Blake]] 19:27 (PST) 1 May 2004.

This project was definitely begun by one person, and all praise and respect to them for doing so.  But since this is a wikibook, all of us are equal collaborators.  Therefore I'm not sure it's going to be possible to make statements about 'how complete that target is.'  Suppose two or more contributors disagree about how complete that target is?  I can imagine a nice, detailed lengthy entry being viewed as not complete by a trained expert because it lacks certain information and also being viewed as not complete by a trained expert becuase it needs editing and removal of unneccessary details.  I am not opposed at all to the existance of a collaborative project with more controls, more of a 'lead editor' with final say-so, but it shouldn't happen at wikibooks.  Wikibook's strength is (to some) its weakness: we're all chefs in this kitchen.

Therefore, I propose two things.  First, use this discussion page.  Sometimes it will be clear why a change or addition or deletion should occur, and a contributor should just go for it.  For things that might benefit from being explained, use this discussion page.  Don't just change something, come here and discuss it and let others see why it was changed.  Second, as an example of the first, I am going to propose that the 'how complete that target is' section be deleted rather than just delete it myself.  I've explained why I think that should happen, now I'd like to hear what other people think.
--[[User:William Trevor Blake|Trevor Blake]] 15:27, 2 May 2004 (UTC)

I like what I'm hearing.
[[User:dparvaz|Dan Parvaz]] 21:11 (EDT) 2 May 2004

I certainly don't mind removing the progress indicators. In my mind, I would have like to have seen some indication of &quot;textual maturity&quot;. This isn't a text for experts. I don't even think of it as a text by experts, at least not in the traditional sense. We are all well-versed in some area or another. 

I did do some moving around before I got here. The material on the front page relating to some visual languages as well as what appeared to be a college paper on consecutive interpreting seemed a bit out of place up front, so I moved them wholesale to the &quot;Tools&quot; page where they appear in the outline. For the moment, I have left them unaltered, but there are some details which need looking at: 

* The consecutive paper was clearly written to be a self-contained unit, and not part of a broader treatment of interpreting, A certain amount of &quot;dismantling&quot; and &quot;re-incorporating&quot; is probably needed to make it part of an overall story, ''i.e.,'' let's talk about interpreting, and by the way, here's how consecutive work fits into that picture.

* I'm not a huge fan of Wikipedia entries being copied into the text. I quickly created the article on Cued Speech, so that there'd be something to reference, but ideally someone who actually works as a  CST should be able to fill that in. The same applies to ASL, etc. What makes sense here is to describe the various languages in the context of settings, interpreting challenges, etc. And the Wikipedia articles absolutely need to be heavily linked into the book

Anyway,that'll probably do for now... Glad to see folks are emailing and contributing!
--[[User:dparvaz|Dan Parvaz]] 21:11 (EDT) 2 May 2004

Regarding the progress indicators, I'll let you remove them or not as you see fit.  Regarding 'text maturity' I suggest it be defined in the negative: a disclaimer that this is (a) a work in progress (b) by people who are not necessarily professionals or accredited or even competant (c) not to take the place of any more reputable work (d) etc.  When few of these things are true, the disclaimer could be removed and that will be a positive statement of text maturity.

Regarding text moves from front page - I agree with this change and was on my way to do just that.

Regarding moving data over from Wikipedia (or other public domain sources), I'm a fan.  The more raw materails work with, especially at first, the better.  It can and will all be cut to size and augmented as we go along.  I look forward to experts and experienced people from all over the field joining in, but I don't think it's entirely inappropriate to venture our disclaimer-heavy thoughts here until they do.  It's also true that even the top experts don't agree in all areas of study.  Getting something out there, making mistakes and fixing them is  just fine and very linked to the wikibook philosophy.  Waiting to get things right and having authoritative content is also just fine, but less appropriate for a wikibook.  Fortunately none of us have to choose only wikibooks or no wikibooks - I have some small talents to lend here, others lend their greater talents here and elsewhere, and all benefit.  Again, if a person feels a need to get things more authoritative then they can and should take this text and run with it.  That's what public domain is all about.

== Christian Views of Women ==

First, I have to say this project is amazing!  

Second, I propose the section 'Christian Views of Women' be shortened, I personally think it's a wonderful section and very interesting, but I also think it gets off the topic of 'Interpreting in the Religious Setting'.
Jody Johnston

I wrote 'Christian Views of Women' for Wikipedia, and I stand by what I wrote.  What I wrote was heavily edited and almost deleted outright, but what I originally wrote is what I stand by.  But please note I wrote it for Wikipedia as part of that general encyclopedia, and I do not at all think it is appropriate for this Wikibook.  Wikipedia and this wikibook are not the same thing, although they look the same and I write for both.  That entry in Wikipedia is about Christian views of women, and this Wikibook is about visual language interpreting.  If that entry is copied to this book it wasn't done by me nor do I think it's a good idea.  But again, thanks for your kind words and I'm glad you enjoyed the entry.  Anyone curious about it can follow the links in my name. --[[User:William Trevor Blake|Trevor Blake]] 02:15, 4 May 2004 (UTC)</text>

==Input==
''Note on Python version: The following uses the syntax of Python 2.x. Some of the following is not going to work with Python 3.x.''

Python has two functions designed for accepting data directly from the user:
*&lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;raw_input()&lt;/code&gt;

There are also very simple ways of reading a file and, for stricter control over input, reading from stdin if necessary.

===raw_input()===
raw_input() asks the user for a string of data (ended with a newline), and simply returns the string.  It can also take an argument, which is displayed as a prompt before the user enters the data.  E.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print (raw_input('What is your name? '))
&lt;/source&gt;
prints out
&lt;pre&gt;
What is your name? &lt;user input data here&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example: in order to assign the user's name, i.e. string data, to a variable &quot;x&quot; you would type
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = raw_input('What is your name?')
&lt;/source&gt;
Once the user inputs his name, e.g. Simon, you can call it as x
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print ('Your name is ' + x)
&lt;/source&gt;
prints out
&lt;pre&gt;
Your name is Simon
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{NOTE|in 3.x &quot;...raw_input() was renamed to input(). That is, the new input() function reads a line from sys.stdin and returns it with the trailing newline stripped. It raises EOFError if the input is terminated prematurely. To get the old behavior of input(), use eval(input()).&quot;}}

===input()===
input() uses raw_input to read a string of data, and then attempts to evaluate it as if it were a Python program, and then returns the value that results.  So entering
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
[1,2,3]
&lt;/source&gt;
would return a list containing those numbers, just as if it were assigned directly in the Python script.

More complicated expressions are possible.  For example, if a script says:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = input('What are the first 10 perfect squares? ')
&lt;/source&gt;
it is possible for a user to input:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
map(lambda x: x*x, range(10))
&lt;/source&gt;

which yields the correct answer in list form.  Note that no inputted statement can span more than one line.

input() should not be used for anything but the most trivial program. Turning the strings returned from raw_input() into python types using an idiom such as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = None
while not x:
    try:
        x = int(raw_input())
    except ValueError:
        print 'Invalid Number'
&lt;/source&gt;
is preferable, as input() uses eval() to turn a literal into a python type. This will allow a malicious person to run arbitrary code from inside your program trivially.

===File Input===
====File Objects====
Python includes a built-in file type.  Files can be opened by using the file type's constructor:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
f = file('test.txt', 'r')
&lt;/source&gt;
This means f is open for reading.  The first argument is the filename and the second parameter is the mode, which can be 'r', 'w', or 'rw', among some others.

The most common way to read from a file is simply to iterate over the lines of the file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
f = open('test.txt', 'r')
for line in f:
    print line[0]
f.close()
&lt;/source&gt;
This will print the first character of each line.  Note that a newline is attached to the end of each line read this way.

The newer and better way to read from a file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as txt:
    for line in txt:
        print line
&lt;/source&gt;
The advantage is, that the opened file will close itself after reading each line.

Because files are automatically closed when the file object goes out of scope, there is no real need to close them explicitly. So, the loop in the previous code can also be written as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for line in open('test.txt', 'r'):
    print line[0]
&lt;/source&gt;
You can read limited numbers of characters at a time like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
c = f.read(1)
while len(c) &gt; 0:
    if len(c.strip()) &gt; 0: print c,
    c = f.read(1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This will read the characters from f one at a time, and then print them if they're not whitespace.

A file object implicitly contains a marker to represent the current position.  If the file marker should be moved back to the beginning, one can either close the file object and reopen it or just move the marker back to the beginning with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
f.seek(0)
&lt;/source&gt;

====Standard File Objects====
Like many other languages, there are built-in file objects representing standard input, output, and error.  These are in the sys module and are called stdin, stdout, and stderr.  There are also immutable copies of these in __stdin__, __stdout__, and __stderr__.  This is for IDLE and other tools in which the standard files have been changed.

You must import the sys module to use the special stdin, stdout, stderr I/O handles.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sys
&lt;/source&gt;
For finer control over input, use sys.stdin.read(). In order to implement the UNIX 'cat' program in Python, you could do something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    print line,
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that sys.stdin.read() will read from standard input till EOF. (which is usually Ctrl+D.)

===Parsing command line===

Command-line arguments passed to a Python program are stored in sys.argv list. The first item in the list is name of the Python program, which may or may not contain the full path depending on the manner of invocation. sys.argv list is modifiable.

Printing all passed arguments except for the program name itself:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sys
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
  print arg
&lt;/source&gt;

Parsing passed arguments for passed minus options:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sys
option_f = False
option_p = False
option_p_argument = &quot;&quot;
i = 1
while i &lt; len(sys.argv):
  if sys.argv[i] == &quot;-f&quot;:
    option_f = True
    sys.argv.pop(i)
  elif sys.argv[i] == &quot;-p&quot;:
    option_p = True
    sys.argv.pop(i)
    option_p_argument = sys.argv.pop(i)
  else:
    i += 1
&lt;/source&gt;
Above, the arguments at which options are found are removed so that sys.argv can be looped for all remaining arguments.

Parsing of command-line arguments is further supported by library modules optparse (deprecated), argparse (since Python 2.7) and getopt (to make life easy for C programmers).

==Output==
''Note on Python version: The following uses the syntax of Python 2.x. Much of the following is not going to work with Python 3.x. In particular, Python 3.x requires round brackets around arguments to &quot;print&quot;.''

The basic way to do output is the print statement.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Hello, world'
&lt;/source&gt;

To print multiple things on the same line separated by spaces, use commas between them, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Hello,', 'World'
&lt;/source&gt;
This will print out the following:
 Hello, World
While neither string contained a space, a space was added by the print statement because of the comma between the two objects. Arbitrary data types can be printed this way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 1,2,0xff,0777,(10+5j),-0.999,map,sys
&lt;/source&gt;
This will output the following:
 1 2 255 511 (10+5j) -0.999 &lt;built-in function map&gt; &lt;module 'sys' (built-in)&gt;

Objects can be printed on the same line without needing to be on the same line if one puts a comma at the end of a print statement:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in range(10):
    print i,
&lt;/source&gt;
This will output the following:
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

To end the printed line with a newline, add a print statement without any objects.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in range(10):
    print i,
print
for i in range(10,20):
    print i,
&lt;/source&gt;
This will output the following:
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

If the bare print statement were not present, the above output would look like:
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

You can use similar syntax when writing to a file instead of to standard output, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print &gt;&gt; f, 'Hello, world'
&lt;/source&gt;
This will print to any object that implements write(), which includes file objects.

=== Omitting newlines ===

To avoid adding spaces and newlines between objects' output with subsequent print statements, you can do one of the following:

''Concatenation'': Concatenate the string representations of each object, then later print the whole thing at once.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print str(1)+str(2)+str(0xff)+str(0777)+str(10+5j)+str(-0.999)+str(map)+str(sys)
&lt;/source&gt;
This will output the following:
 12255511(10+5j)-0.999&lt;built-in function map&gt;&lt;module 'sys' (built-in)&gt;

''Write function'': You can make a shorthand for ''sys.stdout.write'' and use that for output.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import sys
write = sys.stdout.write
write('20')
write('05\n')
&lt;/source&gt;
This will output the following:
 2005

You may need sys.stdout.flush() to get that text on the screen quickly.

===Examples===

Examples of output with ''Python 2.x'':
* print &quot;Hello&quot;
* print &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;
** Separates the two words with a space.
* print &quot;Hello&quot;, 34
** Prints elements of various data types, separating them by a space.
* print &quot;Hello &quot; + 34
** Throws an error as a result of trying to concatenate a string and an integer.
* print &quot;Hello &quot; + str(34)
** Uses &quot;+&quot; to concatenate strings, after converting a number to a string.
* print &quot;Hello&quot;,
** Prints &quot;Hello &quot; without a newline, with a space at the end.
* sys.stdout.write(&quot;Hello&quot;)
** Prints &quot;Hello&quot; without a newline. Doing &quot;import sys&quot; is a prerequisite. Needs a subsequent &quot;sys.stdout.flush()&quot; in order to display immediately on the user's screen.
* sys.stdout.write(&quot;Hello\n&quot;)
** Prints &quot;Hello&quot; with a newline.
* print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, &quot;An error occurred.&quot;
** Prints to standard error stream.
* sys.stderr.write(&quot;Hello\n&quot;) 
** Prints to standard error stream.
* sum=2+2; print &quot;The sum: %i&quot; % sum
** Prints a string that has been formatted with the use of an integer passed as an argument.
* formatted_string = &quot;The sum: %i&quot; % (2+2); print formatted_string
** Like the previous, just that the formatting happens outside of the print statement.
* print &quot;Float: %6.3f&quot; % 1.23456
** Outputs &quot;Float:  1.234&quot;. The number 3 after the period specifies the number of decimal digits after the period to be displayed, while 6 before the period specifies the total number of characters the displayed number should take, to be padded with spaces if needed.
* print &quot;%s is %i years old&quot; % (&quot;John&quot;, 23)
** Passes two arguments to the formatter.

Examples of output with ''Python 3.x'':
* from __future__ import print_function
** Ensures Python 2.6 and later Python 2.x can use Python 3.x print function.
* print (&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)
** Prints the two words separated with a space. Notice the surrounding brackets, ununsed in Python 2.x.
* print (&quot;Hello world&quot;, end=&quot;&quot;)
** Prints without the ending newline.
* print (&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, sep=&quot;-&quot;)
** Prints the two words separated with a dash.

===File Output===
Printing numbers from 1 to 10 to a file, one per line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
file1 = open(&quot;TestFile.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)
for i in range(1,10+1):
  print &gt;&gt;file1, i
file1.close()
&lt;/source&gt;
With &quot;w&quot;, the file is opened for writing. With &quot;&gt;&gt;file&quot;, print sends its output to a file rather than standard output.

Printing numbers from 1 to 10 to a file, separated with a dash:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
file1 = open(&quot;TestFile.txt&quot;,&quot;w&quot;)
for i in range(1,10+1):
  if i&gt;1:
    file1.write(&quot;-&quot;)
  file1.write(str(i))
file1.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening a file for appending rather than overwriting:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
file1 = open(&quot;TestFile.txt&quot;,&quot;a&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Overview==
Strings in Python at a glance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
str1 = &quot;Hello&quot;                # A new string using double quotes
str2 = 'Hello'                # Single quotes do the same
str3 = &quot;Hello\tworld\n&quot;       # One with a tab and a newline
str4 = str1 + &quot; world&quot;        # Concatenation
str5 = str1 + str(4)          # Concatenation with a number
str6 = str1[2]                # 3rd character
#str1[0] = &quot;M&quot;                # No way; strings are immutable
for char in str1: print char  # For each character
str7 = str1[1:]               # Without the 1st character
str8 = str1[:-1]              # Without the last character
str9 = str1[1:4]              # Substring: 2nd to 4th character
str10 = str1 * 3              # Repetition
str11 = str1.lower()          # Lowercase
str12 = str1.upper()          # Uppercase
str13 = str1.rstrip()         # Strip right (trailing) whitespace
str14 = str1.replace('l','h') # Replacement
list15 = str1.split('l')      # Splitting
if str1 == str2: print &quot;Equ&quot;  # Equality test
if &quot;el&quot; in str1: print &quot;In&quot;   # Substring test
length = len(str1)            # Length
pos1 = str1.find('llo')       # Index of substring or -1
pos2 = str1.rfind('l')        # Index of substring, from the right
count = str1.count('l')       # Number of occurrences of a substring

print str1, str2, str3, str4, str5, str6, str7, str8, str9, str10 
print str11, str12, str13, str14, list15
print length, pos1, pos2, count
&lt;/source&gt;

See also chapter [[../Regular Expression/]] for advanced pattern matching on strings in Python.

==String operations==
===Equality===
Two strings are equal if they have ''exactly'' the same contents, meaning that they are both the same length and each character has a one-to-one positional correspondence.  Many other languages compare strings by identity instead; that is, two strings are considered equal only if they occupy the same space in memory. Python uses the [[Python_Programming/Operators#Identity|&lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; operator]] to test the identity of strings and any two objects in general.

Examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'hello'; b = 'hello' # Assign 'hello' to a and b.
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b                   # check for equality
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == 'hello'             #
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == &quot;hello&quot;             # (choice of delimiter is unimportant)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == 'hello '            # (extra space)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == 'Hello'             # (wrong case)
False
&lt;/source&gt;

===Numerical===
There are two quasi-numerical operations which can be done on strings -- addition and multiplication.  String addition is just another name for concatenation.  String multiplication is repetitive addition, or concatenation.  So:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = 'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; c + 'b'
'ab'
&gt;&gt;&gt; c * 5
'aaaaa'
&lt;/source&gt;

===Containment===
There is a simple operator 'in' that returns True if the first operand is contained in the second.  This also works on substrings

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 'ell'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x in y
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; y in x
True
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that 'print x in y' would have also returned the same value.

===Indexing and Slicing===
Much like arrays in other languages, the individual characters in a string can be accessed by an integer representing its position in the string.  The first character in string s would be s[0] and the nth character would be at s[n-1].

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &quot;Xanadu&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[1]
'a'
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike arrays in other languages, Python also indexes the arrays backwards, using negative numbers.  The last character has index -1, the second to last character has index -2, and so on.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[-4]
'n'
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also use &quot;slices&quot; to access a substring of s.  s[a:b] will give us a string starting with s[a] and ending with s[b-1].

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[1:4]
'ana'
&lt;/source&gt;

None of these are assignable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[0] = 'J'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
TypeError: object does not support item assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[1:3] = &quot;up&quot;
Traceback (most recent call last):
File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
TypeError: object does not support slice assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs (assuming the errors were suppressed):

 Xanadu
 Xanadu

Another feature of slices is that if the beginning or end is left empty, it will default to the first or last index, depending on context:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[2:]
'nadu'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[:3]
'Xan'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[:]
'Xanadu'
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use negative numbers in slices:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s[-2:]
'du'
&lt;/source&gt;

To understand slices, it's easiest not to count the elements themselves. It is a bit like counting not on your fingers, but in the spaces between them. The list is indexed like this:

 Element:     1     2     3     4
 Index:    0     1     2     3     4
          -4    -3    -2    -1

So, when we ask for the [1:3] slice, that means we start at index 1, and end at index 3, and take everything in between them. If you are used to indexes in C or Java, this can be a bit disconcerting until you get used to it.

==String constants==
String constants can be found in the standard string module. An example is string.digits, which equals to '0123456789'.

Links:
* [http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html Python documentation of &quot;string&quot; module] -- python.org

==String methods==
There are a number of methods or built-in string functions:
*'''capitalize'''
*'''center'''
*'''count'''
*decode
*encode
*endswith
*'''expandtabs'''
*'''find'''
*'''index'''
*'''isalnum'''
*'''isalpha'''
*'''isdigit'''
*'''islower'''
*'''isspace'''
*'''istitle'''
*'''isupper'''
*'''join'''
*'''ljust'''
*'''lower'''
*'''lstrip'''
*'''replace'''
*'''rfind'''
*'''rindex'''
*'''rjust'''
*'''rstrip'''
*'''split'''
*'''splitlines'''
*startswith
*'''strip'''
*'''swapcase'''
*'''title'''
*translate
*'''upper'''
*zfill

Only emphasized items will be covered.

===is*===
isalnum(), isalpha(), isdigit(), islower(), isupper(), isspace(), and istitle() fit into this category.

The length of the string object being compared must be at least 1, or the is* methods will return False. In other words, a string object of len(string) == 0, is considered &quot;empty&quot;, or False.

*'''isalnum''' returns True if the string is entirely composed of alphabetic and/or numeric characters (i.e. no punctuation).
*'''isalpha''' and '''isdigit''' work similarly for alphabetic characters or numeric characters only.
*'''isspace''' returns True if the string is composed entirely of whitespace.
*'''islower''', '''isupper''', and '''istitle''' return True if the string is in lowercase, uppercase, or titlecase respectively. Uncased characters are &quot;allowed&quot;, such as digits, but there must be at least one cased character in the string object in order  to return True. Titlecase means the first cased character of each word is uppercase, and any immediately following cased characters are lowercase. Curiously, 'Y2K'.istitle() returns True. That is because uppercase characters can only follow uncased characters. Likewise, lowercase characters can only follow uppercase or lowercase characters. Hint: whitespace is uncased.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; '2YK'.istitle()
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Y2K'.istitle()
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; '2Y K'.istitle()
True
&lt;/source&gt;

===Title, Upper, Lower, Swapcase, Capitalize===
Returns the string converted to title case, upper case, lower case, inverts case, or capitalizes, respectively.

The '''title''' method capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string (and makes the rest lower case). Words are identified as substrings of alphabetic characters that are separated by non-alphabetic characters, such as digits, or whitespace. This can lead to some unexpected behavior. For example,  the string &quot;x1x&quot; will be converted to &quot;X1X&quot; instead of &quot;X1x&quot;.

The '''swapcase''' method makes all uppercase letters lowercase and vice versa.

The '''capitalize''' method is like title except that it considers the entire string to be a word.  (i.e. it makes the first character upper case and the rest lower case)

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
s = 'Hello, wOrLD'
print s              # 'Hello, wOrLD'
print s.title()      # 'Hello, World'
print s.swapcase()   # 'hELLO, WoRld'
print s.upper()      # 'HELLO, WORLD'
print s.lower()      # 'hello, world'
print s.capitalize() # 'Hello, world'
&lt;/source&gt;

Keywords: to lower case, to upper case, lcase, ucase, downcase, upcase.

===count===
Returns the number of the specified substrings in the string.  i.e.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'Hello, world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.count('o') # print the number of 'o's in 'Hello, World' (2)
2
&lt;/source&gt;

Hint: .count() is case-sensitive, so this example will only count the number of lowercase letter 'o's. For example, if you ran: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'HELLO, WORLD'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.count('o') # print the number of lowercase 'o's in 'HELLO, WORLD' (0)
0
&lt;/source&gt;

===strip, rstrip, lstrip===
Returns a copy of the string with the leading (lstrip) and trailing (rstrip) whitespace removed.  strip removes both.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '\t Hello, world\n\t '
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s
         Hello, world

&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.strip()
Hello, world
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.lstrip()
Hello, world
        # ends here
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s.rstrip()
         Hello, world
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the leading and trailing tabs and newlines.

Strip methods can also be used to remove other types of characters.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import string
s = 'www.wikibooks.org'
print s
print s.strip('w')                 # Removes all w's from outside
print s.strip(string.lowercase)    # Removes all lowercase letters from outside
print s.strip(string.printable)    # Removes all printable characters
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:
 www.wikibooks.org
 .wikibooks.org
 .wikibooks.
 &amp;nbsp;
Note that string.lowercase and string.printable require an import string statement

===ljust, rjust, center===
left, right or center justifies a string into a given field size (the rest is padded with spaces).

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
'foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.ljust(7)
'foo    '
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.rjust(7)
'    foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.center(7)
'  foo  '
&lt;/source&gt;

===join===
Joins together the given sequence with the string as separator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
&gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join(seq)
'1 2 3 4 5'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '+'.join(seq)
'1+2+3+4+5'
&lt;/source&gt;

map may be helpful here: (it converts numbers in seq into strings)
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = [1,2,3,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join(map(str, seq))
'1 2 3 4 5'
&lt;/source&gt;

now arbitrary objects may be in seq instead of just strings.

===find, index, rfind, rindex===
The find and index methods return the index of the first found occurrence of the given subsequence.  If it is not found, find returns -1 but index raises a ValueError.
rfind and rindex are the same as find and index except that they search through the string from right to left (i.e. they find the last occurrence)

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'Hello, world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.find('l')
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[s.index('l'):]
'llo, world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.rfind('l')
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[:s.rindex('l')]
'Hello, wor'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[s.index('l'):s.rindex('l')]
'llo, wor'
&lt;/source&gt;

Because Python strings accept negative subscripts, index is probably better used in situations like the one shown because using find instead would yield an unintended value.

===replace===
Replace works just like it sounds.  It returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of the first parameter replaced with the second parameter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hello, world'.replace('o', 'X')
'HellX, wXrld'
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, using variable assignment:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
string = 'Hello, world'
newString = string.replace('o', 'X')
print string
print newString
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:

 Hello, world
 HellX, wXrld

Notice, the original variable (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) remains unchanged after the call to &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt;.

===expandtabs===
Replaces tabs with the appropriate number of spaces (default number of spaces per tab = 8; this can be changed by passing the tab size as an argument). 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
s = 'abcdefg\tabc\ta'
print s
print len(s)
t = s.expandtabs()
print t
print len(t)
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:
 abcdefg abc     a
 13
 abcdefg abc     a
 17

Notice how (although these both look the same) the second string (t) has a different length because each tab is represented by spaces not tab characters.

To use a tab size of 4 instead of 8:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
v = s.expandtabs(4)
print v
print len(v)
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:
 abcdefg abc a
 13

Please note each tab is not always counted as eight spaces. Rather a tab &quot;pushes&quot; the count to the next multiple of eight. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
s = '\t\t'
print s.expandtabs().replace(' ', '*')
print len(s.expandtabs())
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
  ****************
  16

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
s = 'abc\tabc\tabc'
print s.expandtabs().replace(' ', '*')
print len(s.expandtabs())
&lt;/source&gt;

Outputs:
  abc*****abc*****abc
  19

===split, splitlines===
The '''split''' method returns a list of the words in the string.  It can take a separator argument to use instead of whitespace.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'Hello, world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.split()
['Hello,', 'world']
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.split('l')
['He', '', 'o, wor', 'd']
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that in neither case is the separator included in the split strings, but empty strings are allowed.

The '''splitlines''' method breaks a multiline string into many single line strings.  It is analogous to split('\n') (but accepts '\r' and '\r\n' as delimiters as well) except that if the string ends in a newline character, '''splitlines''' ignores that final character (see example).

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &quot;&quot;&quot;
... One line
... Two lines
... Red lines
... Blue lines
... Green lines
... &quot;&quot;&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.split('\n')
['', 'One line', 'Two lines', 'Red lines', 'Blue lines', 'Green lines', '']
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.splitlines()
['', 'One line', 'Two lines', 'Red lines', 'Blue lines', 'Green lines']
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==
#Write a program that takes a string, (1) capitalizes the first letter, (2) creates a list containing each word, and (3) searches for the last occurrence of &quot;a&quot; in the first word.
#Run the program on the string &quot;Bananas are yellow.&quot;
#Write a program that replaces all instances of &quot;one&quot; with &quot;one (1)&quot;. For this exercise capitalization does not matter, so it should treat &quot;one&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, and &quot;oNE&quot; identically.
#Run the program on the string &quot;One banana was brown, but one was green.&quot;

Python handles all errors with exceptions.

An ''exception'' is a signal that an error or other unusual condition has occurred. There are a number of built-in exceptions, which indicate conditions like reading past the end of a file, or dividing by zero. You can also define your own exceptions.

===Raising exceptions===

Whenever your program attempts to do something erroneous or meaningless, Python raises exception to such conduct:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 / 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
&lt;/source&gt;
This ''traceback'' indicates that the &lt;CODE&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/CODE&gt; exception is being raised. This is a built-in exception -- see below for a list of all the other ones.

===Catching exceptions===

In order to handle errors, you can set up ''exception handling blocks'' in your code. The keywords &lt;CODE&gt;try&lt;/CODE&gt; and &lt;CODE&gt;except&lt;/CODE&gt; are used to catch exceptions. When an error occurs within the &lt;CODE&gt;try&lt;/CODE&gt; block, Python looks for a matching &lt;CODE&gt;except&lt;/CODE&gt; block to handle it. If there is one, execution jumps there.

If you execute this code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    print 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print &quot;You can't divide by zero, you're silly.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Then Python will print this:

You can't divide by zero, you're silly.

If you don't specify an exception type on the &lt;CODE&gt;except&lt;/CODE&gt; line, it will cheerfully catch all exceptions. This is generally a bad idea in production code, since it means your program will blissfully ignore ''unexpected'' errors as well as ones which the &lt;CODE&gt;except&lt;/CODE&gt; block is actually prepared to handle.

Exceptions can propagate up the call stack:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def f(x):
    return g(x) + 1

def g(x):
    if x &lt; 0: raise ValueError, &quot;I can't cope with a negative number here.&quot;
    else: return 5

try:
    print f(-6)
except ValueError:
    print &quot;That value was invalid.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
In this code, the &lt;CODE&gt;print&lt;/CODE&gt; statement calls the function &lt;CODE&gt;f&lt;/CODE&gt;. That function calls the function &lt;CODE&gt;g&lt;/CODE&gt;, which will raise an exception of type ValueError. Neither &lt;CODE&gt;f&lt;/CODE&gt; nor &lt;CODE&gt;g&lt;/CODE&gt; has a &lt;CODE&gt;try&lt;/CODE&gt;/&lt;CODE&gt;except&lt;/CODE&gt; block to handle ValueError. So the exception raised propagates out to the main code, where there ''is'' an exception-handling block waiting for it. This code prints:

That value was invalid.

Sometimes it is useful to find out exactly what went wrong, or to print the python error text yourself. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    the_file = open(&quot;the_parrot&quot;)
except IOError, (ErrorNumber, ErrorMessage):
    if ErrorNumber == 2: # file not found
        print &quot;Sorry, 'the_parrot' has apparently joined the choir invisible.&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;Congratulation! you have managed to trip a #%d error&quot; % ErrorNumber
        print ErrorMessage
&lt;/source&gt;
Which of course will print:

Sorry, 'the_parrot' has apparently joined the choir invisible.

==== Custom Exceptions ====

Code similar to that seen above can be used to create custom exceptions and pass information along with them. This can be extremely useful when trying to debug complicated projects. Here is how that code would look; first creating the custom exception class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class CustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.parameter = value
    def __str__(self):
        return repr(self.parameter)
&lt;/source&gt;

And then using that exception:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    raise CustomException(&quot;My Useful Error Message&quot;)
except CustomException, (instance):
    print &quot;Caught: &quot; + instance.parameter
&lt;/source&gt;

====Trying over and over again====

===Recovering and continuing with &lt;CODE&gt;finally&lt;/CODE&gt;===

Exceptions could lead to a situation where, after raising an exception, the code block where the exception occurred might not be revisited. In some cases this might leave external resources used by the program in an unknown state. 

&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clause allows programmers to close such resources in case of an exception. Between 2.4 and 2.5 version of python there is change of syntax for &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; clause.

* Python 2.4

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    result = None
    try:
        result = x/y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print &quot;division by zero!&quot;
    print &quot;result is &quot;, result
finally:
    print &quot;executing finally clause&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

* Python 2.5 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    result = x / y
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print &quot;division by zero!&quot;
else:
    print &quot;result is&quot;, result
finally:
    print &quot;executing finally clause&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Built-in exception classes===
[http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html All built-in Python exceptions]

===Exotic uses of exceptions===

Exceptions are good for more than just error handling. If you have a complicated piece of code to choose which of several courses of action to take, it can be useful to use exceptions to jump out of the code as soon as the decision can be made. The Python-based mailing list software Mailman does this in deciding how a message should be handled. Using exceptions like this may seem like it's a sort of GOTO -- and indeed it is, but a limited one called an ''escape continuation''. Continuations are a powerful functional-programming tool and it can be useful to learn them.

Just as a simple example of how exceptions make programming easier, say you want to add items to a list but you don't want to use &quot;if&quot; statements to initialize the list we could replace this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if hasattr(self, 'items'):
    self.items.extend(new_items)
else:
    self.items = list(new_items)
&lt;/source&gt;
Using exceptions, we can emphasize the normal program flow—that usually we just extend the list—rather than emphasizing the unusual case:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    self.items.extend(new_items)
except AttributeError:
    self.items = list(new_items)
&lt;/source&gt;

As was shown previously, when a plane wave is impingent on an aperture which has dimensions much greater than the wavelength of the wave, diffraction effects are minimal and a segment of the plane wave passes through the aperture essentially unaltered. 

This plane wave segment can be thought of as a wave packet or ray consisting of a superposition of wave vectors very close in direction and magnitude to the central wave vector of the wave packet. In most cases the ray simply moves in the direction defined by the central wave vector, i. e., normal to the orientation of the wave fronts. 

However, this is not true when the medium through which the light propagates is optically anisotropic, i. e., light traveling in different directions moves at different phase speeds. An example of such a medium is a calcite crystal. In the anisotropic case, the orientation of the ray can be determined once the dispersion relation for the waves in question is known, by using the techniques developed in the previous section.

If light moves through some apparatus in which all apertures are much greater in dimension than the wavelength of light, then we can use the above rule to follow rays of light through the apparatus. This is called the geometrical optics approximation. 

This approximation can be applied to any wave theory.

__NOTOC__
A '''chocolate pear bake''' is a dessert that resembles a brownie in appearance, yet contains no flour, instead using whipped egg whites to provide structure.  The pear adds a nice mild fruit tone to the chocolate.

==Ingredients==
*7 oz (200g) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|semisweet chocolate]], chopped or chips
*½ cup (120g) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s, separated
*½ cup (120g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]s, sliced
*lightly [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]], to serve

==Procedure==
#Grease a 9x9 inch (22cm x 22cm) baking dish, and pre-heat the oven to [[cookbook:Oven Temperatures|325°F]] (170°C).
#In a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]], melt the chocolate and butter or margarine. When melted, remove from the heat.
#[[cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] the [[cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]] and sugar together until they become thick and pale yellow.
#In a separate bowl, whisk the [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]s until firm.
#Combine the chocolate and egg yolk mixture, and mix well.
#Beginning with about ⅓ the egg whites, gently [[Cookbook:Folding|fold]] them into the chocolate/egg yolk mixture.
#Add the slices of pear, and stir once or twice. Add the entire mixture to the baking dish.
#[[cookbook:Baking|Bake]] for 35-40 minutes, until the bake is springy yet firm to the touch.
#Serve hot with whipped cream.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Substitute sliced peaches, apples, or orange segments for the pears.
*You are able to get all of these ingredients from your local grocery store. 

==Warnings==
*Overmixing after the egg whites have been added to the batter can result in the bake being too dense.

== History of Dynamics ==
=== Aristotle ===

Aristotle expounded a view of dynamics which agrees closely with our everyday experience of the world. Objects only move when a force is exerted upon them. As soon as the force goes away, the object stops moving. The act of pushing a box across the floor illustrates this principle -- the box certainly doesn't move by itself!

However, if we try using Aristotle's dynamics to predict motion we soon run into problems. It suggests that objects under a constant force move with a fixed velocity but while gravity definitely feels like a constant force it clearly doesn't make objects move with constant velocity. A thrown ball can even reverse direction, under the influence of gravity alone.

Eventually, people started looking for a view of dynamics that actually worked. Newton found the answer, partially inspired by the heavens.

=== Newton ===

In contrast to earthly behavior, the motions of celestial objects seem effortless. No obvious forces act to keep the planets in motion around the sun. In fact, it appears that celestial objects simply coast along at constant velocity unless something acts on them. 

This Newtonian view of dynamics &amp;mdash; objects change their velocity rather than their position when a force is exerted on them &amp;mdash; is expressed by Newton's second law:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force exerted on a body, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is its mass, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is its acceleration. Newton's first law, which states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless a force acts on it, is actually a special case of Newton's second law which applies when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

It is no wonder that the first successes of Newtonian mechanics were in the celestial realm, namely in the predictions of planetary orbits. It took Newton's genius to realize that the same principles which guided the planets also applied to the earthly realm as well. 

In the Newtonian view, the tendency of objects to stop when we stop pushing on them is simply a consequence of frictional forces opposing the motion. Friction, which is so important on the earth, is negligible for planetary motions, which is why Newtonian dynamics is more obviously valid for celestial bodies.

Note that the principle of relativity is closely related to Newtonian physics and is incompatible with pre-Newtonian views. After all, two reference frames moving relative to each other cannot be equivalent in the pre-Newtonian view, because objects with nothing pushing on them can only come to rest in one of the two reference frames! 

Einstein's relativity is often viewed as a repudiation of Newton, but this is far from the truth &amp;mdash; Newtonian physics makes the theory of relativity possible through its invention of the principle of relativity. Compared with the differences between pre-Newtonian and Newtonian dynamics, the changes needed to go from Newtonian to Einsteinian physics constitute minor tinkering.

== Newton's 3 Laws of Motion ==



== '''Newton's first law:''' ==


&quot;An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force&quot;. He gave this law assuming the body or the system to be isolated. If we look upon into our daily life we finds that this law is  applicable in reality like a bicycle stops slowly when we stop paddling, this is because in our daily life there are 2 external forces which opposes the motion, these are frictional force and air resistance( These force aren't included in the course of an isolated system). But if these two forces are absent the above law is applicable, this can be observed in space.

== '''Newton's second law:''' ==

Newton's second law of motion states, &quot;The rate change of linear momentum of an object is directly proportional to the external force on the object.&quot; The concept behind this is - &quot;Forces arises due to interaction between the bodies.&quot; With the help of this law we can derive this formula: &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;. In this formula, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; means the force exerted on the object, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; means the mass of the object, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; means the acceleration of the object. Also the second law of motion is universal law in nature, i.e. it consists of both the laws. Newton assumed the body to be an isolated one, thus according to second law, if there is no interaction between bodies of two different systems( means not to be an isolated one), then there is no force that can stop or shake the object from it's state of being.
Suppose two bodies are interacting with each other, then each of them would be exerting force on the other( Look from each side and apply second law of motion), it is third law.

== '''Newton's third law:''' ==

&quot;Every action has an equal and opposite reaction&quot;
This means if body A exerts a force on body &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then body &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; exerts a force on body &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction from the force from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_{AB} = - F_{BA}&lt;/math&gt;

*Negative sign shows that the force is in opposite direction.</text>

== Work ==

When a force is exerted on an object, energy is transferred to the object. The amount of energy transferred is called the work done on the object. Mathematically work done is defined as the dot\scalar product of force and displacement, thus it is a scalar quantity.  However, energy is only transferred if the object moves. Work can be thought of as the process of transforming energy from one form into another.  The work ''W''  done is

:&lt;math&gt;	W=F\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

where the distance moved by the object is &amp;Delta;''x'' and the force exerted on it is ''F''. Notice that work can either be positive or negative. The work is positive if the object being acted upon moves in the same direction as the force, with negative work occurring if the object moves opposite to the force.

This equation assumes that the force remains constant over the full displacement or distance( depending on the situation). If it is not, then it is necessary to break up the displacement into a number of smaller displacements, over each of which the force can be assumed to be constant. The total work is then the sum of the works associated with each small displacement. In the infinitesimal limit this becomes an integral

:&lt;math&gt;W=\int F(s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt;

If more than one force acts on an object, the works due to the different forces each add or subtract energy, depending on whether they are positive or negative. The total work is the sum of these individual works.

There are two special cases in which the work done on an object is related to other quantities. If ''F'' is the total force acting on the object, then by Newton's second law ''W''=''F''&amp;Delta;''x''=''m''&amp;Delta;''x''&amp;middot;''a'' . However, ''a''=''dv''/''dt'' where ''v'' is the velocity of the object, and &amp;Delta;''x''&amp;asymp;v&amp;Delta;''t'', where &amp;Delta;''t''  is the time required by the object to move through distance &amp;Delta;''x'' . The approximation becomes exact when &amp;Delta;''x'' and &amp;Delta;''t'' become very small. Putting all of this together results in
	
:&lt;math&gt;W_{total}=m\frac{dv}{dt}v\Delta t=\Delta t \frac{d}{dt} \frac{mv^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

We call the quantity ''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 the ''kinetic energy'', or ''K''. It represents the amount of work stored as motion. We can then say

:&lt;math&gt;W_{total}=\frac{dK}{dt}\Delta t=\Delta K&lt;/math&gt; 

Thus, when ''F'' is the only force, the total work on the object equals the change in kinetic energy of the object. This transformation is known as &quot;Work-Energy theorem.&quot; 

The other special case occurs when the force depends only on position, but is not necessarily the total force acting on the object. In this case we can define a function

:&lt;math&gt;V(x)=-\int^x F(s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt;

and the work done by the force in moving from ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is ''V''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-''V''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), no matter how quickly or slowly the object moved.

If the force is like this it is called ''conservative'' and ''V'' is called the potential energy. Differentiating the definition gives

:&lt;math&gt;F=-\frac{dV}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

The minus sign in these equations is purely conventional.

If a force is conservative( The force whose effect doesn't depend on the path it has taken to go through), we can write the work done by it as

:&lt;math&gt;W=-\frac{dV}{dx}\Delta x= -\Delta V&lt;/math&gt;

where is the change in the potential energy of the object associated with the force of interest.

== Energy ==

The sum of the ''potential''( Energy by virtue of its position) and ''kinetic''(Energy by virtue of its motion) energies is constant. We call this constant the total energy ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;E = K + U&lt;/math&gt;

If all the forces involved are conservative we can equate this with the previous expression for work to get the following relationship between work, kinetic energy, and potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta K = W = -\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;

Following this, we have a very important formula, called the '''Conservation of Energy'':

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(K+U)=0&lt;/math&gt;

This theorem states that the total amount of energy in a system is constant, and that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

== Power ==

The power associated with a force is simply the amount of work done by the force divided by the time interval over which it is done. It is therefore the energy per unit time transferred to the object by the force of interest. From above we see that the power is

:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{F \Delta x}{\Delta t}=Fv&lt;/math&gt;
	
where is the velocity at which the object is moving. The total power is just the sum of the powers associated with each force. It equals the time rate of change of kinetic energy of the object:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{total}=\frac{W_{total}}{\Delta t}=\frac{dK}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

==Introduction==

The cuisine of Spain is one of the most intriguing the world has to offer.  The diverse landscape, climate, and culture of Spain, combined with its rich history, create a cuisine unlike any other.  The turbulent history of the Iberian Peninsula had a great influence on the cuisine of Spain, as the Romans, the Visgoths, and the Moors all left their culinary mark. The post-Franco Renaissance that encouraged richness and diversity in all aspects of life is demonstrated through the unique Spanish way of cooking.  Spain is made up of 17 autonomous regions, each differing in natural resources, creating a variety of specialty dishes specific to each region.  In general, Spanish cuisine relies on Mediterranean flavors - garlic, olive oil, and fresh herbs.  Spanish cuisine is sophisticated, yet basic, unadorned and elegant.

==Dining Customs==
The meal hours and dining customs in Spain are very different from those in many other countries.  [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]] in Spain is known as &quot;el desayuno,&quot; and is not so much a meal, but a very small nibble in the morning.  Many Spaniards will just have coffee, or &quot;café con leche&quot;, while others have coffee and cookies, toast, cereals or a croissant.

The main meal, &quot;la comida&quot;, is eaten in the middle of the day, but is usually more substantial than lunch.  La comida is usually eaten around 2 o'clock in the home, as a family, and is an important part of Spanish custom.  La comida is usually a three course meal.  Bread, water and wine are typically served with the meal.

La cena, or dinner as we know it, is a lighter meal than la comida. This simple meal is eaten after 9 o'clock.

When dining in Spain, there are some different table manners that are an important part of proper etiquette:

*If you are invited for a meal in a Spaniard's home, it is proper to bring a gift such as chocolates, pastries, cakes, wine, liquer or brandy, or flowers.
*Remain standing until you are invited to sit down.  You may be shown to a particular seat.
*Do not begin eating until the hostess starts.
*Always keep your hands visible when eating by resting your wrists on the edge of the table.  It is rude to have your hands under the table!
*The hostess gives the first toast and it is customary for the honored guest to return the toast later in the meal.
*Use silverware for eating most foods- even fruits are eaten with a fork and knife!
*The best way to compliment the cook is by accepting another serving when offered.
*If you have not finished eating, cross your fork and knife on your plate with the fork over the knife.
*Indicate you have finished eating by placing your fork and knife parallel on your plate, tines facing up, handles facing to the right.

==Cuisine by Region==
===National dishes===

===Andalucía===

Andalucía is the region located in the southern part of Spain, that makes up part of the Iberian Peninsula.  This is an area that was inhabited by Greeks, Phoenicians, Romans, Visgoths, Berbers and Arabs before being conquered by the Spanish crown. This diverse cultural heritage has greatly impacted the dishes that Spaniards in the south enjoy today.  The conquest resulted in the introduction of olive oil and garlic to the Iberian Peninsula,  Spain now being the largest producer of olive oil in the world.  The Romans introduced Andalucíans to the cooking methods of roasting, grilling, and baking.  Their most important contribution was the introduction of irrigation systems, which allowed for the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and a variety of grains.

The Visgoths brought spinach, radishes, and some beans to Andalucía.  Spain's cuisine was completely revolutionized by the Moorish conquest of 711, during which the Moors occupied the country for more than seven centuries, leaving a great culinary mark.  When the Moors conquered Spain, they brought almonds, rice, sugar cane, eggplant, citrus fruits, and spices, which are all very important to Spain's cuisine.

The warm and varied landscape and climate of Andalucía has a large influence on the gastronomy.  Andalucía is made up of mountain ranges, countryside and coast, which makes for a wide range of possibilities when it comes to cultivating crops.  Being surrounded by both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, you are always sure to find fresh caught seafood in most of Andalucía.

===Valencia===
Valencia is a region of Spain that is located on the Mediterranean coast.   Valencia was known as the &quot;Garden of Spain,&quot; because of its orange groves, olive groves, rice fields, and vineyards that nowadays have become wonderful villas with their nice swimming pool.  There is a variety of delicious seafoods in Valencia because it is right on the sea.  The cuisine in Valencia is similar to that of Andalucía, because it is a Mediterranean diet, influenced by the Romans, Arabs, and Moors.

During the 500 year rule of the Moors, a water canal system for agriculture was built in Valencia, which contributed greatly to the growth of new crops.  The Arabs brought artichokes, nuts, dried fruit, and rice, which grows abundantly in the swampy land near the Mediterranean.  The mass production of rice is especially important in Valencia, because it allows the creation of [[cookbook:Paella|Paella]].  The Arabs also introduced important spices in cooking, such as saffron, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

===Catalonia===
Catalonia makes up the northeastern corner of Spain.  Like the other regions, Catalonia's cuisine is predominantly Mediterranean, but the influences of other cultures can certainly be tasted.  The Romans and the Greeks have impacted the cuisine, along with the French, and Italians.  This has resulted in the blending of the Mediterranean diet, with dishes that can be recognized as French or Italian.

To the east, Catalonia borders on the Mediterranean Sea, the coastlines being the Costa Brava and the Costa Daurada in the Tarragona area.  This location introduces a seafood cuisine, such as lobster, crayfish, sea urchins, rock fish, and many more.  Inland, Catalonia is made up of valleys, and mountains, such as the Pyrenees, which contribute other important staples to the cuisine.  Mushrooms grow in all parts of Catalonia, as well as other vegetables and rice.  Catalonia is well known for its various sausages and mixed vegetable stews.  Catalonia is also very well known for its wine and vineyards, due to the varied landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you've got a few chords under your belt, you're ready to start learning some songs. Great! There are several ways to learn songs, and some are more accessible than others. 

==General Tips==

There are two basic forms that appear in thousands of songs. They are the twelve bar blues and the thirty-two bar ballad. Both forms are used extensively in all genres. The blues and rock 'n 'roll genres both use the twelve-bar blues form and many songs by Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly are twelve bar blues and therefore very easy to learn. If you are trying to learn a jazz standard then you will find that many of them are of the thirty-two bar form. Practicing and understanding these two basic forms is essential for the guitarist who wishes to learn songs.

Practice the song slowly (especially if it's a fast song) until you can play it flawlessly. Then, when you are confident with the notes you are supposed to play, increase the speed until you can play along with the song.

Using a drum-machine or metronome when practicing is recommended. An alternative method for improving timing is to play along with your favorite artists.

==Methods of Learning==
===Sheet Music===
The best way is to find sheet music for the song you are trying to learn, like a tab book, available from any guitar shop. Tab books are good, because they are almost always accurate, and they not only show the notes you're supposed to play, but they give good sense of how to play the notes. Generally they include both the rhythm and lead part, even written on the same page if they are played at the same time.

Tab books are expensive and there's a learning curve associated with fluent tab reading, especially if you have no prior knowledge of music notation. Understanding [[Music Theory|music theory]], even just enough to properly (and easily) read a tab book is a challenge but not insurmountable. Being able to read music, whether it's tab or notation, will improve your playing.

===Online Tab===

A much quicker, cheaper and often faster way to learn is to search for an online tab of the song you're looking for. Simply type &quot;Artist Name Song Name tab&quot; into your favorite search engine, and &quot;voila!&quot;, you have dozens to choose from. The online tab community is thriving, and there are many popular sites where you can find tabs for most popular songs. Some sites even feature a MIDI of the song, to make learning even easier.

There are several downsides to online tab, some of which are outlined in the [[Guitar/Tablature|Tablature section]]. The biggest problem is lack of accuracy. Always remember that online tabs are not made by professionals like tab books, and that somewhere down the line someone was sitting at home with a CD and figured it out by trial and error. Thus, the more complicated the song, the less likely the tab you are reading is 100% accurate. But since most people don't play a song ''exactly'' as it sounds on the album (even the recording artists!), this isn't such a big deal.

Another down side is that there is a huge amount of stealing in the community, and if you are looking for an obscure tab, you might only find one actual tab, with copies of it on every site you visit. Some sites allow for multiple versions, and some use voting or comments to give you a sense of how accurate the tab is. However, don't let voting alone determine which tab you read, because if the people who vote don't know how to play the song either, then they might vote a terrible tab really high. In general, you should read two or three tabs for a song, and then from that determine how you intend to play the song. Comments on a song can contain slight revisions or alternate fingerings for chords, so it is good to check those out.

===By Ear===

Songs can also be learned &quot;by ear&quot;, with no sheet music. Essentially you just listen to the song and try to figure it out, with nothing for reference. Knowledge of music theory is particularly helpful for this method. It probably sounds a lot harder to learn this way than it is, but it is a really good way to practice whatever music knowledge you have. And it is especially rewarding being able to figure out a famous musicians piece and saying &quot;I could have made that up!&quot;

First, you should always try and figure out the key (or scale) the song is in. Knowing the key essentially tells you two important things; what the root notes are of the chords they are playing, and the scale that is used for soloing. When you know the scale, you can also probably figure out which scale degree is supposed to be major or minor.

To figure out the key, try playing random notes on the fretboard, and when one &quot;works&quot;, play a major or minor pentatonic scale beginning with that note. Once you have figure out a few more notes, you will probably have a good idea of what scale is being used. If that doesn't work, try humming the chords being used, and then match those tones on the guitar. Be careful you don't accidentally start humming the lead vocals, because although that will help determine the key, the chords are likely different.

Once you know what key the song is in, the rest generally follows pretty quickly. Some of the tricky bits can be one-note riffs, arpeggios, of specific voicing of the chords they are using.

If have no experience of keys and their relationship to writing songs, then figuring out songs by ear is more difficult. Essentially you need to just find the same notes or chords and write them down or remember them. Generally this involves a lot of trial and error, but working this way provides excellent ear training.

===Other Guitarists===

This is perhaps the best way to learn. Playing with another guitarist gives you the opportunity to ask questions about chords and rhythms, and it gives you a chance to see and hear what the song is supposed to be like when it's performed live. However, the down side is that often a guitarist learns to play a song &quot;their way&quot;, and they don't care about how it's &quot;really&quot; supposed to be played. Thus, you might not be learning the song exactly, but rather a slightly different version.

===Concert Videos===

Another place to learn is by watching concert videos, especially on DVDs where they allow you to pick camera angles. Often they will have a camera never breaks away from lead guitarist. By following along, you can learn exactly how a particular guitarist plays a particular song live.

The downside of this is that not every artist (especially new ones) has a concert DVD. Also, the guitarist may be playing the song differently live than on the album, so depending on how accurate you intend to be with your learning and playing, watching a video may not be the best way.

==Chord Progressions==

Songs are created using chords. Chords are derived from scales. The chords that are derived from one diatonic scale never change. If you learn the seven chords in the key of C major, then when you find a song in that key, you can quickly work out the chord progressions that make up the song.

&lt;u&gt;Chords in C major&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=7&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;
Note that the chords in the key of C major consists of 3 major chords, 3 minor chords and 1 diminished chord. This holds true for all major keys.

===Chord Theory===

Songs in the key of C major will start with a C major chord and end with a C major chord. The tonic chord of C major is the chord that defines the key ( the name tonic is derived from the word tonal). If you think of music as a journey then the tonic chord is the starting point and the return point. The notes in the scale of C major are named:

I is the Tonic 

II is the Supertonic

III is the Mediant

IV is the Subdominant

V is the Dominant

VI is the Relative Minor

VII is the Leading Note

VIII is the Octave

Tonic - is the first note of the scale and it is this note that determines the tonality or key, hence the name Tonic.

Supertonic – the word “super” comes from the Latin verb “superare” which means “to be above”. The second note of any scale is always above the tonic.

Mediant – the mediant refers to the fact that this note lies halfway between the tonic and the dominant.

Subdominant – the word “sub” means &quot;to be below&quot;. This note is below the dominant. 

Dominant – this note has this name because with the tonic it sets the tonality or key. The tonic and dominant notes, more than any of the others, determines the tonality of a piece of music. The fifth note of the scale is therefore a dominant factor.

Relative Minor – so called because this is the tonic note of the corresponding natural minor scale. Every major scale has a corresponding natural minor scale that contains exactly the same notes. So the relative minor of the C major scale is A natural minor. It is also called the submediant because is lies three notes below the octave as the mediant lies three notes above the tonic.

Leading-note – whenever you play a scale and arrive at this note, you will find that it naturally wants to move up to the octave note. People have a psychological expectation of music. The most important need is for the “musical journey” to have a start and end. If you were to play the C major scale and stopped at the leading-note, you would always have the sense that the scale is incomplete.

Octave – the same note as the tonic but an octave higher in sound and the end of the musical journey that a scale takes us on.

All the chords in C major take the same names given to the degrees of the scale. You can refer to the dominant note or the dominant chord.

===Common Progressions===
The tonic, subdominant and dominant are called the tonal chords. The supertonic, mediant and relative minor are called the modal chords. The tonal chords define tonality (key) and the modal chords suggest modality. If you play only the modal chords Am and Em from the key of C major the listener will eventually interpret the music to be in the key of A minor (aeolian mode). It must be noted that Am and Em has to be stated over a lengthy period of time. Analyzing chord progressions starts with the tonal chords:

Step One: Try the progression I-V (Tonic to Dominant)

Step Two: Try the progression I-IV (Tonic to Subdominant)

Step Three: Try the progression I-VI or I-III (Tonic to Relative Minor) or (Tonic to Mediant)

Step Four: Try the progression I-II (Tonic to Supertonic)

If you know the song starts with a C major chord and none of the above works then the song may contain chromatic chords. It is common practice to change the modal chords which are minor into their major counterparts. So D minor becomes D major and E minor becomes E major. The chromatic supertonic and the chromatic mediant are a common compositional device. Even though you have added chromatic chords the listener will still interpret the key as C major. 

Try playing this progression: '''C - E major - Am - G'''

&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow=4&gt;

File: C major chord for guitar (open).png|'''C major'''
File: E major chord for guitar (open).png|'''E major'''
File: A minor chord for guitar (open).png|'''A minor'''
File: G major chord for guitar (open).png|'''G major'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

In the above chord progression you have played a chord that doesn't belong to the key of C major. The tonality of the piece is preserved by the following chords which are diatonic to the key. 

===How To Continue Learning===

* Take formal lessons from a qualified teacher. Be sure to seek testimonials and references.
* Watch others play. Notice what they have to pay attention to and what seems like magic. 
* Practice arbitrary scale runs.  Go up and or down 3 or 4 notes and then move up the scale with the same interval.
* Jam up with friends who are better than you as frequently as possible
* Get some friends along who are at the same skill level and form a band of your own
* Listen to your favorite music and try to envision what the guitarist is doing to make the notes come out as they do.
* Listen to different music.  It may open your mind to techniques and phrasing you never imagined using before.  It may also expand your musical library.  Pick any genre you're not familiar with.  Get a feel for the timing and note choice.  Into classical?  Try bluegrass.  Headbanger?  Pick up some jazz or blues.  Then move on to your hero's heroes.  Find out what musical influences got Jimi Hendrix, B.B King or Eric Clapton primed for stardom.

A great way to continue learning if you can already play is to teach guitar to other people.

'''Lasagne''' is a baked pasta dish.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb. sweet Italian sausage 
* 1/2 lb. minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped fine
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed 
* 3 1/2 Tablespoons sugar
* 1 Tablespoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] (divided)
* 4 cups canned whole tomatoes, undrained, halved, seeds removed
* 12 oz tomato paste
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 Tablespoon salt
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Ricotta|ricotta cheese]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 16 oz package lasagna
* 16 oz package of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]], thinly sliced (a wire cutter is nice for semi-soft cheeses like this)
* about 3 Tbsp. grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]

==Procedure==
#Remove sausage casings, and break sausage into small bits. 
#Sauté sausage and ground beef in 5-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat with onion and garlic until the meat is browned.
#Add sugar, 1 Tablespoon salt, basil, fennel, pepper, and half the parsley; mix well.
#Add tomatoes, tomato paste and water, mashing the tomatoes a bit. Bring the sauce to a boil then reduce heat and simmer, covered and stirring occasionally for 1 1/2 hours.
#Preheat oven to 275 degrees F.
#Cook and drain pasta.
#In a medium bowl mix ricotta, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining parsley.
#Assemble your lasagna in a 13&quot; x 9&quot; x 2&quot; roasting pan (listed bottom to top):
#*bottom layer of sauce (approx. 1 1/2 cups)
#*layer of pasta (overlapping slightly)
#*layer of 1/2 the ricotta mixture
#*layer of 1/3 of the mozzarella
#*sauce layer (again, about 1 1/2 cups)
#*layer of grated Parmesan sprinkled over sauce (not so much that the sauce layer is covered entirely)
#*layer of pasta
#*layer of remaining ricotta
#*layer of 1/3 of the mozzarella
#*layer of remaining sauce
#*layer of sprinkled Parmesan
#*layer of remaining mozzarella
#Cover the lasagna with foil and roast 30 minutes covered, then 25 minutes uncovered (or until bubbly and lightly browned). Cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Uncooked lasagnas freeze very well so the extra work can be done well in advance. You can make several batches at a time and freeze the extras to thaw out and cook later.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I've been looking over the Geometry &quot;pages&quot; and I saw this Angles &quot;page.&quot;  The diagrams are good, but the article needs more work as of May 2, 2004.  The written discussion could be much improved.

== Angles AREN'T really the intersection of 2 rays ==

So after my second year of teaching HS Geometry, I've come to believe that teaching angles are the intersection of 2 rays is misleading and incorrect.  The &quot;angle&quot;, as traditionally drawn, is a shorthand, or a representation for a unit of rotational measurement.  But it is the ROTATION that is primary, not the Angle Diagram, as we usually see.

Let's go back to the foundations of measurement.  In the measurement world, there are two parallel universes:  Rotational measurement and Linear Measurement.  Linear measurement is measurement of displacement from a starting location. You start here, you move for a bit, and now you are 10 meters away.  In Physics, velocity, acceleration, momentum, and position are all measurements that live in the &quot;Linear&quot; world.

In the Rotational World, there is a completely parallel universe.  We have Rotational Velocity, Rotational Acceleration, Rotational Momentum, and it is all based on an underlying measurement:  Rotational Position.

'''Angles are a measurement of Rotational Position.  They answer the question:  &lt;u&gt;How far did something turn?&lt;/u&gt;'''

In my experience, teaching young students that angles are the intersection of two lines does not teach the true nature of an angle.  I have had much more success teaching the concept of rotational measurement.  Once that concept is understood, we can back down to the traditional representation, shown by two rays that share an endpoint.  But until students understand the concept of rotation, the diagram involving rays simply confuses them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''triangle''' is a type of [[../Polygon|polygon]] having three sides and, therefore, three angles.  The triangle is a closed figure formed from three straight [[Geometry/Points, Lines, Line Segments and Rays|line segment]]s joined at their ends.  The [[Geometry/Points, Lines, Line Segments and Rays|point]]s at the ends can be called the corners, angles, or vertices of the triangle.  Since any given triangle lies completely within a [[Geometry/Points, Lines, Line Segments and Rays|plane]], triangles are often treated as two-dimensional geometric figures.  As such, a triangle has no [[volume]] and, because it is a two-dimensionally closed figure, the flat part of the plane inside the triangle has an [[../Area|area]], typically referred to as the area of the triangle.  Triangles are always convex polygons.

A triangle must have at least some area, so all three corner points of a triangle cannot lie in the same line.  The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is always greater than the length of the third side.  The preceding statement is sometimes called the Triangle Inequality.

==Certain types of triangles==

===Categorized by angle===

The sum of the interior angles in a triangle always equals 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  This means that no more than one of the angles can be 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; or more.  All three angles can all be less than 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;in the triangle; then it is called an '''acute triangle'''.  One of the angles can be 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and the other two less than 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;; then the triangle is called a '''[[Geometry/Right Triangles and Pythagorean Theorem|right triangle]]'''.  Finally, one of the angles can be more than 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and the other two less; then the triangle is called an '''obtuse triangle'''.

===Categorized by sides===

If all three of the sides of a triangle are of different length, then the triangle is called a '''scalene triangle'''.

If two of the sides of a triangle are of equal length, then it is called an '''isoceles triangle'''.  In an isoceles triangle, the angle between the two equal sides can be more than, equal to, or less than 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  The other two angles are both less than 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  

If all three sides of a triangle are of equal length, then it is called an '''equilateral triangle''' and all three of the interior angles must be 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, making it '''equilangular'''.  Because the interior angles are all equal, all equilateral triangles are also the three-sided variety of a '''regular polygon''' and they are all [[../Congruency and Similarity|similar]], but might not be [[../Congruency and Similarity|congruent]].  However,  polygons having four or more equal sides might not have equal interior angles, might not be regular polygons, and might not be similar or congruent.  Of course, pairs of triangles which are not equilateral might be similar or congruent.

Further discussion of [[../Congruent Triangles/]] and [[../Similar Triangles/]] may be found in those corresponding sections.

==Opposite corners and sides in triangles==

[[Image:Triangle_ABC.PNG|right|thumb|300px|Picture of Triangle ABC]]

If one of the sides of a triangle is chosen, the interior angles of the corners at the side's endpoints can be called adjacent angles.  The corner which is not one of these endpoints can be called the corner opposite to the side.  The interior angle whose vertex is the opposite corner can be called the angle opposite to the side.  

Likewise, if a corner or its angle is chosen, then the two sides sharing an endpoint at that corner can be called adjacent sides.  The side not having this corner as one of its two endpoints can be called the side opposite to the corner.

The sides or their lengths of a triangle are typically labeled with lower case letters.  The corners or their corresponding angles can be labeled with capital letters.  The triangle as a whole can be labeled by a small triangle symbol and its corner points.  In a triangle, the largest interior angle is opposite to longest side, and vice versa.

Any triangle can be divided into two right triangles by taking the longest side as a base, and extending a line segment from the opposite corner to a point on the base such that it is perpendicular to the base.  Such a line segment would be considered the '''height''' or '''altitude''' ( h ) for that particular '''base''' ( b ).  The two right triangles resulting from this division would both share the height as one of its sides.  The interior angles at the meeting of the height and base would be 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; for each new right triangle.  For acute triangles, any of the three sides can act as the base and have a corresponding height.  For more information on right triangles, see [[../Right Triangles and Pythagorean Theorem/]].

==Area of Triangles== 
[[Image:Triangle (acute)_bh.PNG]]

If base and height of a triangle are known, then the area of the triangle can be calculated by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{b \times h}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol for area)


Ways of calculating the area inside of a triangle are further discussed under [[../Area/]].

[[Category:Geometry (book)]]

==Centres==

The centroid is constructed by drawing all the medians of the triangle. All three medians intersect at the same point: this crossing point is the centroid. Centroids are always inside a triangle. They are also the centre of gravity of the triangle.

The three angle bisectors of the triangle intersect at a single point, called the incentre. Incentres are always inside the triangle. The three sides are equidistant from the incentre. The incentre is also the centre of the inscribed circle (incircle) of a triangle, or the interior circle which touches all three sides of the triangle.

The circumcentre is the intersection of all three perpendicular bisectors. Unlike the incentre, it is outside the triangle if the triangle is obtuse. Acute triangles always have circumcentres inside, while the circumcentre of a right triangle is the midpoint of the hypotenuse. The vertices of the triangle are equidistant from the circumcentre. The circumcentre is so called because it is the centre of the circumcircle, or the exterior circle which touches all three vertices of the triangle.

The orthocentre is the crossing point of the three altitudes. It is always inside acute triangles, outside obtuse triangles, and on the right vertex of the right-angled triangle. 

Please note that the centres of an equilateral triangle are always the same point.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Cookware and bakeware}}

'''Pots and pans''' hold food, generally for cooking on a [[Cookbook:Range|range]]. Sometimes pots and pans are used in an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] or [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]].

Dark gummy burned-on [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] can be removed with acetone, widely available from hardware stores and in diluted form as nail polish remover.

==Common materials==

=== Stainless steel ===
[[Image:Pfanne (Edelstahl).jpg|thumb|right|Stainless steel [[cookbook:Frying Pan|skillet]]]]
Stainless steel is good enough for most uses, although it is not as conductive as aluminium or copper. Stainless steel tends to be inexpensive and lightweight. Stainless steel has the advantage of being non reactive with most household acids. Thin-bottomed pans, often with an insignificant layer of copper, can cause uneven heating, so a layer of aluminium is often &quot;sandwiched&quot; in the base of the pan. 

Even though stainless steel is not considered non-stick, food does not stick very strongly unless the surfaces are rough. Stainless steel is popular for [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepans]] and [[Cookbook:Stock Pot|stock pots]].

=== Anodized aluminium ===
Anodizing is an electro-chemical process that molecularly alters the surface of aluminium cookware making it stick and scratch-resistant and easy to clean. A final stage in the anodizing process seals the aluminium, preventing any leaching into food. Unlike uncoated aluminium, this cookware does not react to acidic foods, and is much more durable. Unlike stainless steel, no &quot;sandwiching&quot; or &quot;cladding&quot; is needed for even heating. Anodized aluminium cookware is generally not dishwasher safe.

=== Cast Iron ===
[[Image:Takoyakikado.Pan.jpg|thumb|right|Cast iron takoyakiki pan]]
Cast iron is denser than other pan materials, making the pans unparalleled at retaining and evenly distributing heat, but also somewhat heavy. Therefore these pans are excellent for applications such as [[cookbook:searing|searing]], or any time when a pan must stay hot even as ingredients are added. 

The pan retains its heat better than most other materials. They can also be put under a very hot grill or into a barbecue or campfire &amp;mdash; something that would completely destroy a non-stick pan &amp;mdash; as they are all-metal and would have to be melted to suffer damage. Contrary to popular belief, acidic foods can be cooked in cast iron, provided they are removed from the pan as soon as cooking is complete.

Cast iron pans can be used for other kinds of cooking as well, although their heaviness makes them somewhat awkward for making, say, [[cookbook:crepes|crepes]], or any other kind of cooking where the pan needs to be moved around a lot during cooking. Cast iron is also less conductive than other materials such as aluminium and copper. This results in the aforementioned excellent heat retention, but also means that cast iron cookware takes longer to heat up and cool down.  

Cast iron needs to be seasoned to provide a more-or-less non-stick surface. This process involves heating oil so that it polymerizes and binds to the pan. This creates a non-stick surface chemically similar to a plastic coating. Some people see this need for seasoning as a drawback; however, because the seasoning can be removed (with steel wool, even!) and reapplied as needed, cast iron pans can be maintained in excellent condition far beyond the life of a typical non-stick pan. 

Properly cared for, a cast iron pan can last for generations. Thus they are an excellent value: extremely durable, costing less than all but the cheapest non-stick pans, while outperforming all but the most expensive cookware. The main drawback is that they will rust if washed in a dishwasher or left soaking in water. Also, they should not be washed with harsh, lye-based soap, as this will remove the seasoning. 

They can be effectively cleaned with a stiff brush, plastic wool, or by rubbing with a paper towel, vegetable oil, and any salt, used as a mild abrasive. Prior to putting them back in storage, if you heat them up, empty, for few minutes, any remaining dampness will evaporate. Generally these retail for no more than US $20.

=== Enameled Cast Iron ===
[[Image:Bolinders pot.jpg|thumb|right|Enameled cast iron [[cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]]]]
Enamelled cast iron cookware &amp;mdash; typically, casseroles or [[cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]]s &amp;mdash; enables cooks to take advantage of the heat retention of cast iron while also providing a non-stick, non-rusting, non-reactive, light-coloured surface (the light-coloured surface makes it easier to monitor how foods are browning). The thickness of the cast-iron core helps guarantee even heating and prevents &quot;hot-spots&quot; and warping from occurring, even on electric stoves.

Some care must be taken in use and storage, as the enamel surface is vulnerable to chipping.

The main drawback of enameled cast iron is expense, with pieces typically being 3-5 times more expensive than their cast-iron counterparts. The enamel is naturally non-stick and cleans easily, but may crack, chip, or discolour over time, particularly if improperly cleaned. Exteriors are generally available in a rainbow of colours.

=== Carbon Steel ===
Like cast iron, carbon steel needs to be seasoned and is vulnerable to acid foods. Like stainless steel, carbon steel is lightweight and inexpensive. Carbon steel can be slightly better than stainless steel on an induction-based [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]]. Carbon steel is very popular for [[Cookbook:Wok|woks]], particularly the large round-bottomed ones.

=== Aluminium ===
Aluminium is lightweight and inexpensive. It conducts heat well, especially if it is thick. This allows for even heating and fast response to desired temperature changes. 

Aluminium usually has a non-stick surface inside it. With or without a non-stick surface, aluminium is vulnerable to scratches. A connection between aluminium and Alzheimer's disease is a concern for many, although a scientific link between the two is inconclusive at best. 

Uncoated aluminium is vulnerable to damage from acid foods like [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]. Low-grade aluminium is easy to dent. Aluminium is popular for [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pans]].

=== Copper ===
In Western cooking, the best pots were made out of a thick layer of copper for good thermal conductivity and a thin layer of tin to prevent the copper from reacting with acidic foods. Copper pans provide the best conductivity, and therefore the most even heating. They tend, however, to be heavy, expensive, and to require occasional retinning. Modern copper cookware is now made with stainless steel lining rather than tin.

=== Glass ===
Glass allows food to be observed while the lid is on. Glass is heavy, because it must be thick enough to prevent shattering. To avoid cracks, avoid sudden large temperature changes (do not drop a very hot glass pot into cold water). 

While not considered non-stick, food does not stick strongly to glass unless baked-on. Glass can be used in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]]. Glass is generally clear or white, the latter known as Corning Ware, a product designed for missile nose cones.

===Combinations===
Multi-ply pans are made from two or more the above materials. Often times, oxidation-prone copper or delicate aluminium are &quot;clad&quot; in stainless steel or some other sturdier material, combining the best features of the many materials and blunting the disadvantages. Also, many pans come with glass lids to allow the user to see inside the pot or pan as the food cooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nautilus underwent several changes between versions 2.4 and 2.6; most notable is the change in the default browsing method. In 2.4, the file manager used a &quot;browse&quot; view similar to using a Web browser; all folders opened in the same window, and it could be used to view files as well. GNOME 2.6 uses a spatial interface by default, which, in essence, makes the window the folder. Each folder opens in a separate window, and this window remembers its size, position, and even location in the file listings.

Some users of GNOME dislike the new interface; it is easy to switch back to the old one by using the [[Using GNOME : Browse Folder|Browse Folder]] command, or by using the [[GConf]] editor to force these changes in the file manager by default. To do this, open &lt;tt&gt;gconf-editor&lt;/tt&gt;, open /apps/nautilus/preferences, and check &quot;always-use-browser&quot;.

A &quot;Computer&quot; icon has also been added to the desktop, which shows disk drives; network computers; and remote FTP, SSH, and WebDAV servers.

The file chooser dialog was completely revamped, replacing the older, harder-to-use version with one resembling the Windows XP file dialog. The newer window shows the path to your location as a series of clickable buttons that will bring you back to that directory. One con of the new &quot;open&quot; dialog is that it no longer allows the user to type in the filename, however.

==Visual Languages of North America==

===American Sign Language===
{{Main|American Sign Language}}

Contrary to popular belief, sign language is not international. Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages develop. As with spoken languages, these vary from country to country. They are not based on the spoken language in the country of origin. And like spoken languages, they developed in antiquity: sign languages are not new, and are no more or less amendable than any spoken language.

Sign language can also be used in other contexts, where normal speech cannot be used. Native American were known to use a signed pidgin to facilitate communication among tribes who used different spoken languages.

American Sign Language is the dominant sign language in the United States, Canada and parts of Mexico. American Sign Language is usually abbreviated ASL though it has also been known as Ameslan. As with other sign languages, its grammar and syntax are separate and distinct from the spoken language(s) spoken in its area of influence. Etymologically, ASL's origins stem from a nineteenth century blending of French Sign Language (LSF) and other American regional and indigenous signed language systems (e.g. Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), used by the residents of the Massachusetts island). Since there is no written form of ASL, there may be other underdocumented influences on the language.

ASL is a natural language as proved to the satisfaction of the linguistic community by William Stokoe. It is a manual language meaning that the information is expressed not with combinations of sounds but with combinations of handshapes, movements of the hands, arms and body, and facial expressions.

Although it often seems as though the signs are meaningful of themselves, in fact they are as arbitrary as words in spoken language. For example, hearing children often make the mistake of using &quot;you&quot; to refer to themselves, since others refer to them as &quot;you.&quot; Children who acquire the sign YOU (pointing at one's interlocutor) make similar mistakes - they will point at others to mean themselves, indicating that even something as seemingly explicit as pointing is an arbitrary sign in ASL, like words in a spoken language.

===Manual Codes of English===
Manual codes of English (MCE) are signing systems (not languages) that utilize the manual component of a signed (read: nonverbal) language to convey the grammatical and syntactical structure of spoken English. They do not share the grammatical and syntactical structure of American Sign Language. Historically, there have been several attempted MCE systems, viz:

====Signed English (SE)====
Signed English is a simplified English-based code, SE only added fourteen grammatical markers. SE was developed in the mid-1970s by Harry Bornstein at Gallaudet College, and further explored in 1983 by Bornstein, Saulnier, &amp; Hamilton. (See Gustason, G. (1990). &lt;i&gt;Signing exact English&lt;/i&gt; and Bornstein, H. (1990). &lt;i&gt;Signed English&lt;/i&gt;. In H. Bornstein (ed.) [http://books.google.com/books?id=eul6HRZJZWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Manual Communication: Implications for Education]. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.) 

====Seeing Essential English, or, formerly ‘SEE1’====
Intended to reinforce basic English morphemic structure, in SEE1:
# compound words are formed with separate signs (‘butter’+‘fly’)
# the same sign is used for homonyms (‘bear’ and ‘bare’)
# there is a heavy use of initialization (haVe)
# affixes, articles, and ‘to be’ verb were added
SEE1 was developed in 1966 by David Anthony at Gallaudet College. SEE1 is no longer in use today.

====Signing Exact English, or, formerly ‘SEE2’====
SEE2 is very similar to SEE1, however:
# compound words are conceptually accurate (‘butterfly,’ not ‘butter’+ ‘fly’)
# more ASL signs (one sounded word = one sign) are used
# there are at least seventy artificial/invented signs and affixes added to this system
SEE2 was developed in 1972 by Gerilee Gustason; SEE2 is currently the “signed English” that is used in American school systems. (This is the ‘Signing Exact English‘ referred to below.)

====Linguistics of Visual English (LOVE)====
The LOVE system was a chirography system based on Seeing Essential English modes; it used the Stokoe Notation System (tab-dez-sig) to codify sentence structure. Unfortunately, there is very little explanation and/or examples extant of the LOVE system. LOVE was developed in 1972 by Dennis Wampler.

====The Rochester Method====
So-called because it was developed in 1878 by Zenas Westervelt, a teacher at the Western New York Institute for Deaf-Mutes (later Rochester School for the Deaf), in the Rochester Method, every word is fingerspelled. Sometimes used in tactile signing situations, some Deaf adults still use this method.

===Signing Exact English===

Signing Exact English (SEE) is a system of signing that strives to be an exact representation of English. It is an artificial system that was devised in 1972. It takes much of its vocabulary of signs from American Sign Language (ASL). However, it often modifies the handshapes used in the ASL signs in order to incorporate the handshape used for the first letter of the English word that the SEE sign is meant to represent. SEE can be thought of as a code for visually representing spoken English. It is used most often with Deaf children in educational settings - the initial goal of SEE was to facilitate the learning of English. It often finds use in the home too, however, as it is often welcomed as an alternative to ASL by hearing parents of Deaf children because it does not require them to learn a new grammar or syntax. Therfore, it is easier learn for people who have already internalized English. It is not often used by adult Deaf people except to communicate with hearing people who know some sign but who are not fluent users of ASL.  SEE is not a single coded sign: there is SEE1, SEE2, L.O.V.E, MCE, and more.

As with almost every aspect of the education of deaf children, the use of SEE is mired in controversy concerning its efficacy and utility. In a way, it is a slight variation of the oralist vs. manualist controversy which has pitted those that have supported the use of sign language against those that believed in lipreading and speech therapy as the best way to educate deaf children. This debate has raged for centuries.

===Cued Speech===
Cued speech is a manual system which, when produced near the mouth while speaking, helps the Deaf disambiguate the phonemes in spoken language. Cued speech combines eight arbitrary handshapes and four locations to visually and phonetically approximate the sounds of English. While not a signed language, it is a visual means of representing spoken language segments. Developed in 1966 by Dr. Robert Cornett, an engineer at Gallaudet College, as an educational and communicative tool for the Deaf.

===Summary interpretation===

==Consecutive Interpreting==
            
In its purest form, consecutive interpretation is a mode in which the interpreter begins their interpretation of a complete message after the speaker has stopped producing the source utterance.  At the time that the interpretation is rendered the interpreter is the only person in the communication environment who is producing a message.  In practice, a consecutive interpretation may be rendered when the interpreter does not have a text in its entirety, that is, the person delivering the source utterance may have more to say, but the interpreter has enough information to deliver a message that could stand alone if need be.  It is important to note that although the person who originated the message has ceased their delivery of new information, this speaker has not necessarily given up the floor and, once the interpretation has been delivered, the speaker may resume delivery of their message.  
            

Though most people may be more familiar with simultaneous interpretation, where the interpreter renders their interpretation while still receiving the source utterance, consecutive interpretation has distinct advantages in certain interpreting situations, not the least of which is that consecutive interpretations render more accurate, equivalent[i], and complete target texts.  In fact, the two modes, when performed successfully, employ the same cognitive processing skills, with the only difference being the amount of time that elapses between the delivery of the source utterance and the delivery of theinterpretation.  This being the case, mastery of techniques used in consecutive interpretation can enhance an interpreter’s ability to work in the simultaneous mode.
 
The Interpreting Process

Before we continue I would like to take a moment to explain the interpreting process in order to explain how consecutive interpretations produce more accurate and equivalent target texts.  In order to interpret a text the interpreter must be able to receive and understand the incoming message and then express it’s meaning in the target language.  In order to accomplish this task, the interpreter must go through an overlapping series of cognitive processing activities.  These include: attending to the message, concentrating on the task at hand, remembering the message, comprehending the meaning of the message, analyzing the message for meaning, visualizing the message nonverbally, and finally reformulating the message in the target language[ii].  Seleskovitch (1978) compresses these tasks into three steps, noting that the second step includes the, “Immediate and deliberate discarding of the wording and retention of the mental representation of the message” (Seleskovitch, 8); interpreters often refer to this as “dropping form.”  By discarding the form (words, structure etc.) of the source text the interpreter is free to concentrate on extracting and analyzing the meaning of the text, and conceiving strategies for reformulating the message into the target language.

Seleskovitch, among others, points out that there is another practical reason for the interpreter to discard the form of the source text, there is only so much that a person can hold in their short-term memory.  As the interpreter receives the source text the information passes initially through their short-term memory.  If the interpreter does not do anything with this information it will soon disappear.  Smith (1985) notes that, “Short term memory...has a very limited duration.  We can remember...six or seven items only as long as we give all of our attention to them” (Smith, 38).  If an interpreter attempts to retain the form of a source utterance their short-term memory will be quickly filled with individual lexical items, which may not even compose a full sentence.  If the interpreter 
then attempts to find a corresponding lexical item in the target language for each of the source language forms in their short-term memory all of their attention will be wasted on translating these six items rather than attending to the incoming message, as Smith points out, “as long as pay attention to short-term memory we cannot attend to anything else” (Smith, 38).  In a consecutively interpreted situation this would result in the interpreter stopping the speaker every six or seven words so that the interpreter could clear their short-term memory and prepare to receive new information.  Cleary this is not a preferable manner in which to communicate, and, as Seleskovitch points out, it would require the interpreter to know every existing word in both languages. 

It is because of the limitations of short-term memory that interpreters are required to drop form and concentrate on meaning.  Both Seleskovitch and Smith propose that meaningful segments of great size can be placed into long-term memory and retrieved later. Of course a chunk of information must be understood in order to be meaningful.  To demonstrate this idea Seleskovitch uses the example of a person who has just seen a movie, after viewing the film the person will be able to relate the plot and many of the details of the of the film.  If the person continues to discuss the film with others the details will remain fresh in their mind for a longer period of time.  In this example the person is able to remember the film because they understood it, and are, “conversant with the various themes found in films...the movie-goer can easily and fully process the ‘information’ conveyed...and for this reason he remembers” (Seleskovitch, 1979, 32).  Smith adds, “it takes no longer to put a rich and relevant chunk of meaning into long-term memory than it does a useless letter or word” (Smith, 45), because of this the moviegoer will probably be able to relate the salient points of the film in a fraction of the time it took them to receive the information.  Since the information was understood, its salient points can be reformulated into another mode of communication.  For example, when the moviegoer discusses the plot of the film they do not recreate its form, nor do they take two hours to render their “interpretation.”

Due to the greater ease of assimilating larger meaningful chunks of information it behooves the interpreter to focus their attention on these larger chunks.  A larger chunk of text will usually contain a greater amount of meaning.  It is this relationship that aids the interpreter’s understanding of the source text when working consecutively.  As shown above, once a chunk of information is understood it can be reformulated into another form.  As Seleskovitch (1978) points out, “In consecutive interpretation the interpreter has the advantage of knowing line of the argument before he interprets” (Seleskovitch, 28).  

Interpreters are not charged with merely understanding the message, they must also be able to remember it, in order to deliver their interpretation.  Seleskovitch notes that dropping form aids the interpreter’s memory because they are not concentrating on remembering the words, or even the structure of the source text.  Instead, the interpreter understands the message, connects it to long-term memory, and is then able to reformulate it in much the same way the moviegoer can relate the points of a film.  Of course the interpreter must provide a more equivalent target text than the moviegoer.  To this end interpreters working consecutively will often make notes as they take in the source utterance.  These notes help the interpreter retrieve the message from their long-term memory and consist of, “symbols, arrows, and a key word here or there” (Seleskovitch, 1991, 7).  These few notes are effective because interpreters do not produce their target texts based on the form used by the speaker but on what they understood of the meaning of the source text.  The “key words” may consist of words that will remind the interpreter of the speaker’s point, or of specific information “such as proper names, headings and certain numbers” (Seleskovitch, 1978, 36).

Seleskovitch also points to the time afforded an interpreter working in the consecutive mode as an asset in reformulating the message in the target language.  Because the interpreter does not need to split their attention between receiving the message, and monitoring their output, as is required in simultaneous, they can devote more of their processing to analysis and reformulation of the text thereby producing a more accurate and equivalent interpretation.
 

Situations for Consecutive Interpreting


Even though the interpreter’s goal is always to produce the most accurate and equivalent target text possible consecutive interpretation is not always possible.  Situations where one speaker maintains the floor, with little or no interaction with the audience and situations where there is rapid turn taking between a group of interlocutors may require the interpreter to work simultaneously.  While Seleskovitch notes that spoken language interpreters working at international conferences may sometimes interpret entire speeches consecutively, the consecutive mode often requires some type of pause so that the interpreter may render the message.  


That said, there are situations that lend themselves to consecutive interpretation, I would like to discuss three such situations, one general, and two specific.  In general, consecutive interpretation can be employed successfully in one-on-one interpreted interactions.  One-on-one interactions often allow for more structured turn taking behavior than large group situations.  Interviews, parent teacher meetings, and various type of individual consultations may be interpreted consecutively with minimal disruption to the flow of communication perceived by the participants.
            

Specifically, there are two types of interpreted situations that, due to the consequences involved, require consecutive interpretation rather than simultaneous.  These are legal and medical interpreted interactions.  In these situations, where a person’s life or freedom is at stake, accuracy and equivalence are of the utmost priority; as we have seen, consecutive interpretation provides greater accuracy and equivalence than simultaneous does.  Palma (1995) points out that the density and complexity of witness testimony requires the interpreter to work consecutively, and to be aware of how long a chunk they can manage effectively.  Palma notes that, especially during expert witness testimony, where the language used can be highly technical and is more likely to use complex sentence constructions; a segment of text that is short in duration may be extremely dense in terms of the content and complexity of its ideas.  In this case the consecutive mode has the added advantage of allowing the interpreter to ask speaker to pause so that the interpreter may deliver the message.  The interpreter may also take advantage of the time in which they hold the floor to ask the speaker for clarification.  Use of the consecutive mode is also helped by the fact that court officials (attorneys, judges etc.) may be familiar with the norms of consecutive interpretation and by the fact that turn taking between the witness and the attorney often proceeds with only one the two speaking at any one time.
           

In the case of medical interpreting accuracy and equivalence are also at a premium due to the possible consequences of a misdiagnosis.  Like expert witness testimony, doctor-patient interactions may be filled with medical jargon or explanations of bodily systems that may be particularly dense for the interpreter.  Again turn taking may be more structured in a one-on-one medical environment especially if the patient is in full control of theirfaculties.  As in the legal setting, the medical interpreter may take advantage of the structure of a doctor-patient interaction in order to request for pauses and clarifications.
            

Generally, the logistics of a consecutively interpreted interaction must be established before the communication takes place.  In the case of a single speaker who will have little or no interaction with the audience this means either the speaker will pause for the interpreter, or the interpreter, and hopefully the audience, knows that the interpretation will not be delivered until the speaker has finished.  Establishing the logistics with all the parties involved, before the interpreted interaction takes place, can help prevent the uneasiness that participants often feel while waiting for the interpreter to begin.
 

Consecutive in Relation to Simultaneous
            

As mentioned above the primary difference between consecutive and simultaneous interpreting is involves the time lapse between the delivery of the speaker’s message and the beginning of the interpretation.  While this is a significant difference, one that provides more challenges for the interpreter, at their roots consecutive and simultaneous interpreting modes stem from the same set of cognitive processes.  These processes are described by many interpreting theorists, (Gish, 1986-1994; Colonomos, 1989; Isham, 1986), while Seleskovitch (1978) establishes the parallel between consecutive and simultaneous.  According to Seleskovitch an interpreter working in the simultaneous mode uses the same strategies, dropping form, analyzing the message for meaning, and developing a linguistically equivalent reformulation, as does the interpreter working consecutively.  After all, the goal is the same for both interpreters; to deliver an accurate and equivalent target text.  The difference is that in the simultaneous mode the interpreter continues to receive and process new information while rendering, and monitoring the target for equivalence.  Because interpreters working in the simultaneous mode are still interpreting meaning rather than form they also allow for a lag between themselves and the speaker.  That is, the interpreter waits until the speaker has begun to develop their point before beginning to interpret.  By allowing for lag time, and the interpreter ensures that they are interpreting meaning, not just individual lexical items, which Seleskovitch suggests would be an exercise in futility.
            

“Even memorizing a half dozen words would distract the interpreter, whose attention is already divided between listening to his own words, and those of the speaker...His memory does not store the words of the sentence delivered by the speaker, but only the meaning those words convey.” (Seleskovitch, 1978, 30-31)  
            

Seleskovitch solidifies the correlation between the cognitive processes involved in each mode when she states, “simultaneous interpretation can be learned quite rapidly, assuming one has already learned the art of analysis in consecutive interpretation” (Seleskovitch, 30).  This view has been adopted at interpreter training programs at both California State University Northridge and Gallaudet University, both of whom require classes teaching text analysis and consecutive interpreting skills prior to those dealing with simultaneous interpreting.
 

Conclusion
            

Rather than being two separate skills, mastery of consecutive interpretation is in fact a building block for successful simultaneous interpretations.  In fact, thanks to the time allowed for comprehension and analysis of the source text consecutive interpretations offer greater accuracy and equivalence than do simultaneous interpretations.  There are situations that lend themselves to consecutive interpretations (one-on-one interactions), and others still which require use of the consecutive mode (legal, medical) due to the consequences of a possible misinterpretation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear people editing this book, while math is useful and does have its place in an electronics textbook, it makes it very hard for people to understand electronics.  So I ask the people editing this book to somehow make a clear division between theory and practice.  Ideally I would like people with no background in electronics or math to be able to understand electronics.  By a similar token, I'm sure that everyone editing this book would appreciate a rigorous explaination of electronics.  The main reason I say this is that electronics is one of the most misunderstood subjects in existence, and unlike gravity very few people have any sort of intuition about E&amp;M. 

In reading &lt;i&gt;A Brief History of Time&lt;/i&gt; by Steven Hawking he said (and I paraphrase) that his editor told him that for each formula that he included in his book the readership would drop by one half.  As a result the only formula he included was the one Einstein is famous for.  I would suggest you keep that in mind as you add math equations.  Decide if the equation you are adding really adds enough value to the work to justify the loss of half the readers being able to comprehend the passage.  Not saying to leave them out, but don't add them for their own sake.
----
The aim of this textbook is to educate someone with little or no previous experience in electronics to a 1 or 2 year level. This includes a thorough understanding of DC and AC electronics concepts, and an introduction into logic gates and digital electronics, which should be covered in another textbook.

''I think we need to establish what they '''do''' know, so we know how in depth we should go.  What is our target audience?''

I think we should go as far as we can adequately explain.  Meaning we can include anything we want but we have to be rigorous about the theory.  If this means giving a summary of specific results from other fields, then so be it.  The idea is not to prove everything in that field, but to tell how it relates to electronics.  A good balance would be to focus on the theory and to provide a link to the math.  That way we can cater to everyone, both newbies and the people who understand electronics.
----

My idea for the road map for this book:
* Electricity
** [[Electronics:Charge|Charge]]
** Voltage
** Current
** Resistance
* Ideal circuits &amp; real circuits (and a description of the difference between schematics that just show wiring between real components, and schematics which show the ideal functioning of components)
** Ideal voltage and current sources
** Ideal nodes and meshes
** Capacitors
** Inductors
*** Introduce magnetism here or in the electricity section?
*** Transformers
** Controlled voltage and current sources
* Other types of components
** Diodes
*** Bridge rectifiers, LEDs, etc.
** Transistors (presenting these as controlled variable resistors is more intuitive than as &quot;amplifiers&quot; or controlled voltage sources)
*** BJTs
*** FETs
** Vacuum tubes
** Op-amps next?
* Digital circuits
** AND OR gates
** other gates
** Show how every gate can be built with a NAND or whatever
* Radio can come after all of that

''Your road map looks similar to what we have except minus the section on power.  Also I am not sure how big a difference there is between ideal and real. What major structural changes you would like to make to the book?''

:I just meant I think it should be in this order.

=Difference between ideal and real circuits=

A real circuit diagram shows real components and how they are connected:

[[Image:Realswitchercircuit.png]]

An ideal circuit diagram shows how each components functions, using ideal components (perfect voltage sources, perfect resistors, etc.)  This is what allows us to do mathematical calculations to determine how the circuit works:

[[Image:Idealizedswitchercircuit.png]]

The circuit can be even more idealized by showing things that wouldn't have an effect normally, but might in specific situations.  Every resistor has some capacitance and inductance, every capacitor has some resistance and inductance, every opamp has some input current, input capacitance, output resistance, finite gain, parasitic capacitances, etc etc etc).  All of these would have a huge effect on circuit performance if the circuit is operating near MHz frequencies, for instance.

Now I am thinking we should just have an explanation of the difference between the two types of circuit diagrams first.  Then when we introduce each component, we will tell how it ideally behaves, and how a real component behaves.  All coils have non-negligible resistance, for example, and all diodes have at least a little voltage drop.

/ I understand that you feel this is an important topic, but try not to go overboard in covering it, for all practical purposes, ideal circuits can be used without much problem.

== Electronics vs. Practical Electronics ==

May I propose that this textbook be concerned with how the components works, and the textbook [[Practical Electronics]] be concerned with how to make circuits work, along with tips and tricks like good soldering technique, etc? That way, people who just want to learn how to do something without trawling through the equations can do it at Practical Electronics, and those who would like to know exactly why somethings works can do so here. Otherwise, both sides lose out.

Just a thought, as it seems to me that PE is otherwise just another version of this book

Also, I thnk that perhaps this books should just have a basic overview of semiconductors, and PE can take care of the practicalities (which transistor to use for what, etc), and [[Semiconductors]] can take care of the equations and physics. Otherwise, this book stands to have a huge chunk of information that exists in common with Semiconductors

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]] | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

'''French toast''' is a common [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] item made by [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] a piece of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] soaked in an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]]. French toast was developed as a way to use day-old stale bread. When lacking stale bread, [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasting]] your bread lightly will help it absorb more of the egg and milk batter.

French toast is usually served with toppings similar to those used for [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffles]], and [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]]. Suggested toppings are:

* real [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], table syrup
* [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]], fruit syrup
* [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]]
* [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] (as served in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]])
* [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
* [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]] and/or [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]] and/or [[Cookbook:Blueberry|blueberries]] 

It can also be served as part of a fried breakfast with savory foods like sausages (or vegetarian equivalent), tomato (or ketchup), baked beans, fried mushrooms etc.

This recipe is easily scalable.  The simplest thing to do is to memorize the recipe for two slices (1 serving), and then multiply to make more. You can coat slightly more than one serving with the wet parts of the recipe (2 1/4 - 2 1/2 normal-sized slices).

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] for every 2 slices of bread 
* approximately 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (more for softer, less egg-like French toast; less for firmer, more egg-like toast)
* 2 slices [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], preferably 1 in. slices of French bread
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (best), [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]

Optional:

*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract or similar
*1/4 - 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] or other powdered [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]] suitable for sweet foods
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

Makes 2 slices of French toast.

==Bread==

The following types of bread have been carefully chosen for making a perfect french toast. Hard crust breads are recommended. Softer breads will create a soggy toast. Toast your bread before dipping it into the mix to create a solid base.

*1. Sourdough
*2. Challah
*3. Schiacciata
*4. Portuguese sweet bread (&quot;Massa Suvada&quot;). This bread will take your french toast to new heights.
*5. Whole-wheat raisin bread or schiacciata.
*6. King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread
*7. Panettone (bread with raisin, but may be too sweet for some)
*8. Brioche (weaved bread)
*9. Chinese bakery loaves of bread. Ask to get it cut thick or uncut.

==Procedure==
#In a bowl, mix eggs and milk, and optional ingredients.  
#Heat up a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]] to medium-low heat.
#Grease the pan with butter, margarine, or cooking spray.
#Soak a slice of bread in the egg-milk mixture and place on pan; repeat until pan is full or desired amount is placed.
#[[Cookbook:Browning|Brown]] both sides bread.
#Serve on plates, usually two slices per person, with toppings as desired.

==Tips==
The goal is to get both sides of the French toast nicely browned, while making sure the center is cooked. Using excessive heat could scorch the outside of the toast while leaving the inside undercooked.

Also, if you are not producing many multiples of the recipe, it is easier to evenly soak each slice of bread in the egg and milk mixture if you make it in small batches, with one egg and 1/4 cup of milk and two slices at a time in one bowl. Then, soak the two slices until almost all of the mixture has been absorbed. If the bowl is small, place the two slices on top of each other, and keep switching and flipping them, so that all four sides will absorb the mixture.

The cooking process is too short to use most raw [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]], but some fresh [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] might be very tasty.
{{Wikipedia|French toast}}

If using sandwich bread, a plastic sandwich container may be used for the egg-milk mixture. This allows maximum use of the mixture, as the container is a good size and shape.

'''Leavening agents''' are used to make bread and other foods rise, trapping many little air bubbles in the food.  This gives the final product a less dense, lighter consistency than it would have if leavening had not taken place.  The various methods for leavening include biological and chemical reactions, as well as mechanically trapping air in a substance.
&lt;noinclude&gt;
==Chemical leavening==
These leavening agents work by releasing carbon dioxide gas as they react with water, heat, or acid in the food.

*[[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*[[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] (sodium bicarbonate)
*[[Cookbook:Horn salt|horn salt]] (hartshorn - ammonium bicarbonate)

==Biological leavening==
These leavening agents work by [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermenting]] sugars in the food to produce carbon dioxide. The fermentation typically produces additional flavour compounds, such as the sour flavours in sourdough bread.

*[[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] (unpasteurised - live yeast)
*[[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
*[[Cookbook:Ginger beer|ginger beer]]
*[[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]]
*[[Cookbook:Sourdough Starter|sourdough starter]]
*[[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
*[[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]

==Mechanical leavening==
These leavening agents work either by releasing gas already trapped in the product, or by incorporating air into the product by beating / stirring. If a gas is used, it is usually [[w:Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]], although sometimes [[w:Nitrous oxide|nitrous oxide]] is used (as in the case of canned whipped cream).

The vast majority of crystals used in electronics are
[[:w:piezoelectric|piezoelectric]] crystals.

The piezoelectric effect (converting back and forth between electrical voltage and mechanical position) makes [[:w:Quartz|quartz]] crystals physically vibrate. The quartz crystal can be cut into the right shape and appropriately mounted so that it &quot;rings&quot; (vibrates) only at one precise frequency, useful for clock circuits.

Some quartz crystals are used as SAW filters.

[[:w:Lead zirconate titanate|PZT crystals]] are used in ultrasonic devices such as [[:w:Medical ultrasonography|Medical ultrasonography]]. They use the piezoelectric effect to convert electrical energy to sound energy to send out a pulse, then convert the sound energy of the echo back to electrical energy.

==Quartz==

(The ''[[:w:atomic clock|atomic clock]]s'' in [[:w:GPS|GPS]] satellites use the oscillations of cesium atoms in gas form as the time reference. That gives far better precision than any known crystal oscillator.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Area of [[../Circle/]]s==
The method for finding the area of a circle is

:&lt;math&gt;Area = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''π'' is a constant roughly equal to 3.14159265358978 and ''r'' is the radius of the circle; a line drawn from any point on the circle to its center.

==Area of [[../Triangle/]]s==
Three ways of calculating the area inside of a triangle are mentioned here.

===First method===
If one of the sides of the triangle is chosen as a '''base''', then a '''height''' for the triangle and that particular base can be defined.  The height is a line segment perpendicular to the base or the line formed by extending the base and the endpoints of the height are the corner point not on the base and a point on the base or line extending the base.  Let B = the length of the side chosen as the base.  Let &lt;br&gt;h = the distance between the endpoints of the height segment which is perpendicular to the base.  Then the area of the triangle is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{B \times h}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

This method of calculating the area is good if the value of a base and its corresponding height in the triangle is easily determined.  This is particularly true if the triangle is a right triangle, and the lengths of the two sides sharing the 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; angle can be determined.

===Second method===
{{Main|Hero's Formula}}, also known as Heron's Formula

If the lengths of all three sides of a triangle are known, Hero's formula may be used to calculate the area of the triangle.  First, the '''semiperimeter''', s, must be calculated by dividing the sum of the lengths of all three sides by 2.  For a triangle having side lengths a, b, and c :  

:&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the triangle's area is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;Area = \sqrt{s\left(s-a\right)\left(s-b\right)\left(s-c\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

If the triangle is needle shaped, that is, one of the sides is very much shorter than the other two then it can be difficult to compute the area because the precision needed is greater than that available in the calculator or computer that is used.  In otherwords Heron's formula is numerically unstable.  Another formula that is much more stable is:

:&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{\sqrt{\left(a + \left( b + c \right) \right) \cdot \left( c - \left( a - b \right) \right) \cdot \left( c + \left( a - b \right) \right) \cdot \left( a + \left( b - c \right) \right) }}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; have been sorted so that &lt;math&gt;a \ge b \ge c&lt;/math&gt;.

See also [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeronsFormula.html Heron's Formula at MathWorld] and [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf How JAVA's Floating-Point Hurts Everyone Everywhere]

===Third method===
In a triangle with sides length a, b, and c and angles A, B, and C opposite them, 

&lt;math&gt; A = \frac{1}{2}ab \cdot \sin(C) = \frac{1}{2}bc \cdot \sin(A) = \frac{1}{2}ac \cdot \sin(B)&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is true because &lt;math&gt; h = \sin(C) &lt;/math&gt; in the formula &lt;math&gt; A = \tfrac{1}{2}Bh &lt;/math&gt;. It is useful because you don't need to find the height from an angle in a separate step, and is also used to prove the law of sines (divide all terms in the above equation by a*b*c and you'll get it directly!)

==Area of [[Rectangle]]s==
The area calculation of a rectangle is simple and easy to understand.  One of the sides is chosen as the '''base''', with a length b.  An adjacent side is then the '''height''', with a length h, because in a rectangle the adjacent sides are perpendicular to the side chosen as the base.  The rectangle's area is given by:

&lt;math&gt;A = b \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, the baselength may be referred to as the length of the rectangle, l, and the height as the width of the rectangle, w.  Then the area formula becomes:  

&lt;math&gt;A = l \cdot w&lt;/math&gt;

Regardless of the labels used for the sides, it is apparent that the two formulas are equivalent.

Of course, the area of a square with sides having length s would be:

&lt;math&gt;A = s^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Area of [[../Parallelograms/]]==
The area  of a parallelogram can be determined using the equation for the area of a rectangle. The formula is:

&lt;math&gt;A = b \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

A is the area of a parallelogram.
b is the base.
h is the height.

The height is a perpendicular line segment that connects one of the vertices to its opposite side (the base).

==Area of [[../Rhombus/]]==
Remember in a rombus all sides are equal in length. 

&lt;math&gt;A= \frac{d_1 \cdot d_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2&lt;/math&gt; represent the diagonals.

==Area of [[../Trapezoids/]]==
The area of a trapezoid is derived from taking the arithmetic mean of its two parallel sides to form a rectangle of equal area.

&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\left(b_1 + b_2\right) \cdot h}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; are the lengths of the two parallel bases.


==Area of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_(geometry) Kites]==
The area of a kite is based on splitting the kite into four pieces by halving it along each diagonal and using these  pieces to form a rectangle of equal area.

&lt;math&gt;A = {{a \cdot b} \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;

Where a and b are the diagonals of the kite.

Alternatively, the kite may be divided into two halves, each of which is a triangle, by the longer of its diagonals, a. The area of each triangle is thus


:&lt;math&gt;{a \cdot {b \over 2}} \over 2 &lt;/math&gt;


Where b is the other (shorter) diagonal of the kite.
And the total area of the kite (which is composed of two identical such triangles) is


:&lt;math&gt; 2 \cdot {{a \cdot {b \over 2}} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;


Which is the same as


:&lt;math&gt;{a \cdot {b \over 2}}&lt;/math&gt;


or


:&lt;math&gt;{a \cdot b} \over 2&lt;/math&gt;

==Areas of other [[../Quadrilaterals/]]==
The areas of other quadrilaterals are slightly more complex to calculate, but can still be found if the quadrilateral is well-defined. For example, a quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles, or some combination of triangles and rectangles. The areas of the constituent polygons can be found and added up with arithmetic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Right triangles== 

'''Right triangles''' are [[../Triangle|triangle]]s in which one of the interior [[Geometry/Angles|angles]] is 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  A 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; angle is called a '''right angle'''.  Right triangles are sometimes called '''right-angled triangles'''.  The other two interior angles are '''complementary''', i.e. their sum equals 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  Right triangles have special properties which make it easier to conceptualize and calculate their parameters in many cases.  

The side opposite of the right angle is called the '''hypotenuse'''.  The sides adjacent to the right angle are the '''legs'''.  When using the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse or its length is often labeled with a lower case '''c'''.  The legs (or their lengths) are often labeled '''a''' and '''b'''.  

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Right_triangle_shows_hyp_legs.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;

Either of the legs can be considered a base and the other leg would be considered the height (or altitude), because the right angle automatically makes them perpendicular.  If the lengths of both the legs are known, then by setting one of these sides as the '''base''' ( b ) and the other as the '''height''' ( h ), the area of the right triangle is very easy to calculate using this formula:


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Right_triangle_bh.PNG]]&lt;math&gt;Area = \,&lt;/math&gt;'''(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''&lt;math&gt; b h \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This is intuitively logical because another congruent right triangle can be placed against it so that the hypotenuses are the same line segment, forming a rectangle with sides having length b and width h. The area of the rectangle is  b &amp;times; h, so either one of the congruent right triangles forming it has an area equal to half of that rectangle.  

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Two right triangles in rectangle.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;

Right triangles can be neither equilateral, acute, nor obtuse triangles.  Isosceles right triangles have two 45&amp;deg; angles as well as the 90&amp;deg; angle.   All isosceles right triangles are similar since corresponding angles in isosceles right triangles are equal.  If another triangle can be divided into two right triangles (see [[../Triangle/]]), then the area of the triangle may be able to be determined from the sum of the two constituent right triangles.
Also the Pythagorean theorem can be used for non right triangles. a2+b2=c2-2c

==Pythagorean Theorem==

For history regarding the Pythagorean Theorem, see [[w:Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean theorem]].  The '''Pythagorean Theorem''' states that:

* In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.  

Let's take a right triangle as shown here and set c equal to the length of the hypotenuse and set a and b each equal to the lengths of the other two sides.  Then the Pythagorean Theorem can be stated as this equation:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Pythagorean_triangle.PNG]]            &lt;math&gt; \quad  c^2 = a^2 + b^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, if the lengths of any two of the sides of a right triangle are known and it is known which side is the hypotenuse, then the length of the third side can be determined from the formula.

==Sine, Cosine, and Tangent for Right Triangles==

'''Sine''', '''Cosine''', and '''Tangent''' are all functions of an angle, which are useful in right triangle calculations.  For an angle designated as &amp;theta;, the sine function is abbreviated as  '''sin''' &amp;theta;, the cosine function is abbreviated as '''cos''' &amp;theta;, and the tangent function is abbreviated as '''tan''' &amp;theta;.  For any &lt;br&gt;angle &amp;theta;, sin &amp;theta;, cos &amp;theta;, and tan &amp;theta; are each single determined values and if &amp;theta; is a known value, sin &amp;theta;, cos &amp;theta;, and tan &amp;theta; can be looked up in a table or found with a calculator.  There is a table listing these function values at the end of this section.  For an angle between listed values, the sine, cosine, or tangent of that angle can be estimated from the values in the table.  Conversely, if a number is known to be the sine, cosine, or tangent of a angle, then such tables could be used in reverse to find (or estimate) the value of a corresponding angle.  

These three functions are related to right triangles in the following ways:

In a right triangle,

* the sine of a non-right angle equals the length of the leg opposite that angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse.


* the cosine of a non-right angle equals the length of the leg adjacent to it divided by the length of the hypotenuse.


* the tangent of a non-right angle equals the length of the leg opposite that angle divided by the length of the leg adjacent to it.


For any value of &amp;theta;  where cos &amp;theta; &amp;ne; 0,  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\qquad \tan \theta  = \frac {\sin \theta } {\cos \theta }&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

If one considers the diagram representing a right triangle with the two non-right angles  &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;and &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the side lengths a,b,c as shown here:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Right_triangle.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;

For the functions of angle &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_1 = \frac {b} {c} \qquad \cos \theta_1 = \frac{a} {c} \qquad \tan \theta_1 = \frac {b} {a} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Analogously, for the functions of angle &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_2 = \frac {a} {c} \qquad \cos \theta_2 = \frac {b} {c} \qquad \tan \theta_2 = \frac {a} {b} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

General rules for important angles:
&lt;math&gt; sin 45^o = cos 45^o = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; tan 45^o = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; sin 30^o = \frac{1}{2} = cos 60^o &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; cos 30^o = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = sin 60^o &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''GNOME''' is a graphical enviroment designed for the GNU/Linux Operating System, but also works on other platforms (see [[../Platforms|Supported Platforms]]). It is designed to be usable, accessible, free (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software Free Software]) and internationalized. For more on GNOME see [http://www.gnome.org/about/ about GNOME].

The word GNOME, which is pronounced &quot;Guh-'nome&quot;, (as it's part of the [[GNU]] Project) is an acronym for GNU Object Model Environment, and is written in all capital letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Waste basket''' is a place to store unwanted files. Emptying the wastebasket deletes all files in it '''permanently''', so make sure there is no important files in there by mistake.

You can also have the option to delete files instantly without moving it to the wastebasket first. To enable this, choose &quot;Edit, Preferences&quot; from the file manager window, then on the behavior tab select &quot;Include a Delete command that bypasses Wastebasket&quot;. use this with care. It is like using a shredder to destroy a document.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|Cuisine of France]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Mousse au chocolat''' (French for &quot;chocolate foam&quot;) is a sweet food, normally served as dessert.

==Ingredients==

* 200 g (8 oz) [[Cookbook:Bittersweet chocolate|bittersweet chocolate]], chopped (see Note)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s (see Note)
* 250ml (1 cup) [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 40g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 30 ml (2 tablespoons) hot water

==Procedure==
# Melt the chocolate in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]].
# Separate the eggs.
# Whisk the egg whites and cream separately until very firm. Put both in the refrigerator.
# Combine the egg yolks and hot water in a mixing bowl; maximum tap water temperature is enough, approx. 50–60°C (120–140°F).  Using a [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]], beat slowly while adding the sugar, then speed up the mixer until the mixture is thick and becomes a light yellow color.
# Stir the melted chocolate into the yolk mixture (the chocolate should have cooled enough that it does not hurt if you insert your finger). Mix immediately, otherwise this will cook the egg yolks, and you'll have chocolate scrambled eggs!
# With the whisk (from now on do not use the mixer) add the egg whites in three parts to the chocolate mixture, followed by the whipped cream.
# The finished mousse should be light brown and very fluffy. While it is still liquid, divide it into individual serving dishes. Allow to chill in the refrigerator for 4–6 hours before serving.  The mousse will be quite firm when ready.
# Take a spoon and enjoy!

==Notes, tips and variations==

* This recipe is not the &quot;purest&quot; form, which contains only bittersweet chocolate and eggs: 6 eggs for 200 g (8 oz) of chocolate; no cream, no sugar.
* It is one of the easiest recipes for untrained cooks. The only &quot;difficult&quot; parts are separating the eggs and folding the egg whites.
* For the more advanced cook: use a fourth yolk (and ''only'' the yolk!); it ensures that the mousse becomes firm. However, the mixture must be worked faster, beginning with the addition of the chocolate to the yolk/sugar mixture.
* Instead of the water, use an alcoholic spirit such as Cognac, Cointreau, Kahlua, Triple Sec, etc., for all or part of the 30 ml. However, the mousse is then not suitable for children or pregnant women.
* Coffee can also be satisfyingly substituted for the liquid.
* Almond powder, almond butter, or orange rind can also be used to add flavor to the mousse (one tablespoon per 6 eggs)
* There is also an [[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse|Atkins-friendly recipe]].

==Warnings==

* This mousse is best consumed within 24 hours.
* Do not keep substantially longer, even if refrigerated.

== Complaint! ==

This seems to be almost a chocolate custard rather than a mousse. I regard mousse as simple whipped cream and chocolate (with liquid additives for desired flavour). Adding egg (although it is inarguably an excellant imulsifier) really seems to be cheating to me, not to mention making what I see as a sort of custard. #include disclaimer.h [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]
:I look at it differently.  To me chocolate and whipped cream combine to become chocolate whipped cream, which isn't bad, but isn't mousse either.  In a mousse, the egg yolks add a richness that is lacking in chocolate whipped cream, while the whites aid the cream in making the mousse light and fluffy.  In a custard, the eggs are not seperated, which obviously means the whites aren't whipped.  Additionally, a custard is normally at least partially cooked, while a mousse remains basicly raw, other than melting the chocolate. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 04:48, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::Hmm further reaserach shows that my origional sources are the extreme minority. Odd. Very well, move along, nothing to see here :P [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

== Safe version? ==

It'd be nice to have a version that didn't involve raw eggs.
I'd rather not get my family killed.

Perhaps one could get pasteurized egg whites or cheat a bit
with unflavored gelatin?

We will now take a break from physics, and discuss the topics of partial derivatives. Further information about this topic can be found at the [[Calculus/Partial differential equations|Partial Differential Section]] in the [[Calculus]] book.

== Partial Derivatives ==

In one dimension, the slope of a function, ''f''(''x''), is described by a single number, ''df/dx''.

In higher dimensions, the slope depends on the direction. For example, if ''f''=''x''+2''y'', moving one unit ''x''-ward increases ''f'' by 1 so the slope in the ''x'' direction is 1, but moving one unit ''y''-ward increases ''f'' by 2 so the slope in the ''y'' direction is 2.

It turns out that we can describe the slope in ''n'' dimensions with just ''n'' numbers, the ''partial derivatives'' of ''f''.

To calculate them, we differentiate with respect to one coordinate, while holding all the others constant. They are written using a &amp;part; rather than ''d''. E.g.

:&lt;math&gt;f(x+dx,y,z)=f(x,y,z)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice this is almost the same as the definition of the ordinary derivative.

If we move a small distance in each direction, we can combine three equations like  1 to get

:&lt;math&gt;df= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz&lt;/math&gt;

The change in ''f'' after a small displacement is the dot product of the displacement and a special vector

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) \cdot \left( dx, dy, dz \right)
=\operatorname{grad} f = \nabla f  &lt;/math&gt;

This vector is called the gradient of ''f''. It points up the direction of steepest slope. We will be using this vector quite frequently.

=== Partial Derivatives #2 ===

Another way to approach differentiation of multiple-variable functions can be found in Feynman Lectures on Physics vol. 2. It's like this:

The differentiation operator is defined like this:
&lt;math&gt;df = f(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y, z + \Delta z) - f(x,y,z)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
in the limit of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Adding &amp; subtracting some terms, we get

&lt;math&gt;df = (f(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y, z + \Delta z) - f(x, y + \Delta y, z + \Delta z)) + (f(x, y + \Delta y, z + \Delta z) - f(x, y, z + \Delta z)) + (f(x, y, z + \Delta z) - f(x,y,z))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and this can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz&lt;/math&gt;

=== Alternate Notations ===

For simplicity, we will often use various standard abbreviations, so we can write most of the formulae on one line. This can make it easier to see the important details.

We can abbreviate partial differentials with a subscript, e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;D_x h(x,y)= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} 
\quad D_x D_y h= D_y D_x h&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x h= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} &lt;/math&gt;

Mostly, to make the formulae even more compact, we will put the subscript on the function itself.

:&lt;math&gt;D_x h= h_x \quad h_{xy}=h_{yx}&lt;/math&gt;

== Motion in 2 and 3 Directions ==

Previously, we discussed Newtonian dynamics in one dimension. Now that we are familiar with both vectors and partial differentiation, we can extend that discussion to two or three dimensions.

Work becomes a dot product
:&lt;math&gt;W=\mathbf{F}\cdot \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;
and likewise power
:&lt;math&gt;P=\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

If the force is at right angles to the direction of motion, no work will be done.

In one dimension, we said a force was conservative if it was a function of position alone, or equivalently, the negative slope of a potential energy.

The second definition extends to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=-\nabla V&lt;/math&gt;

In two or more dimensions, these are not equivalent statements. To see this, consider

:&lt;math&gt;D_y\mathbf{F}_x-D_x\mathbf{F}_y=V_{xy}-V_{yx}&lt;/math&gt;

Since it doesn't matter which order derivatives are taken in, the left hand side of this equation must be zero for any force which can be written as a gradient, but for an arbitrary force, depending only on position, such as '''F'''=(''y'', -''x'', 0), the left hand side isn't zero.

Conservative forces are useful because the total work done by them depends only on the difference in potential energy at the endpoints, not on the path taken, from which the conservation of energy immediately follows.

If this is the case, the work done by an infinitesimal displacement ''d'''''x''' must be

:&lt;math&gt;W=V(\mathbf{x})-V(\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{x})=-(\nabla V)\cdot d\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this with the first equation above, we see that if we have a potential energy then we must have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=-\nabla V&lt;/math&gt;

Any such '''F''' is a conservative force.

== Circular Motion ==

An important example of motion in two dimensions is circular motion.

Consider a mass, ''m'', moving in a circle, radius ''r''.

The ''angular velocity'', &amp;omega; is the rate of change of angle with time. In time &amp;Delta;''t'' the mass moves through an angle &amp;Delta;&amp;theta;= &amp;omega;&amp;Delta;''t''. The distance the mass moves is then ''r'' sin &amp;Delta;&amp;theta;, but this is approximately ''r''&amp;Delta;&amp;theta; for small angles.

Thus, the distance moved in a small time &amp;Delta;''t'' is ''r''&amp;omega;&amp;Delta;''t'', and divided by &amp;Delta;''t'' gives us the speed, ''v''.

:&lt;math&gt;v = \omega r \, &lt;/math&gt;

This is the ''speed'' not the ''velocity'' because it is not a vector. The velocity is a vector, with magnitude &amp;omega;''r'' which points tangentially to the circle.

The magnitude of the velocity is constant but its direction changes so the mass is being accelerated.

By a similar argument to that above &lt;!-- exercise --&gt; it can be shown that the magnitude of the acceleration is

:&lt;math&gt;a = \omega v \, &lt;/math&gt;

and that it is pointed inwards, along the radius vector. This is called ''centripetal'' acceleration.

By eliminating ''v'' or &amp;omega; from these two equations we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}= -\omega^2 \mathbf{r} = -\frac{v^2}{r}\mathbf{ \hat{ r}}
&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

A slide is a metal/glass/ceramic tube which fits over a finger (most commonly the ring finger or little finger, but any will work). If you wish to experiment with slide guitar, but do not have a slide, objects ranging from lighters and glass bottles to sections of metal pipe and batteries can work just as well, and in some cases provide entertainment and stage presence to a performance. ''Do not press the string down.'' The slide rests on the string, not enough to give fret buzz, but enough to stop the string buzzing against the slide. Some players will lightly deaden the string behind the slide with a trailing finger to stop any unwanted vibrations.

[[Image:Metal slide guitar.JPG|thumb|right|A metal slide being used]]

Practice getting a crisp note without sliding first. Because the slide rests on the strings, the slide playing a single note should be directly above the fret, not behind it as with the fingers. Usually the slide guitarist keeps the slide moving backwards and forwards slightly to create a vibrato effect.

A common technique found in slide guitar is playing fingerstyle as opposed to the use of a pick or plectrum. The benefits of fingerstyle playing includes the ability to more easily pick the desired strings, while using the other fingers to dampen the other strings from undesired vibration. Raising the action of the guitar is also recommended. The normal low action, which is ideal for playing lead in standard tuning, is counter-productive when playing slide because of string buzz and lack of a clear sounding note. For this reason many guitarists have a second guitar where they raise the action to such a height to make it almost unplayable using normal technique. This high action guitar is permanently kept in a &quot;open tuning&quot; and is used exclusively for slide playing. Note that raising (or lowering) the action means that the intonation of the guitar has to be re-set. This can simply be done with a guitar tuner and just involves turning the string adjuster until the open string and its octave at the twelth fret (frettted and harmonic) produce exactly the same note. Basically the needle/display of an electronic guitar tuner should settle exactly dead center regardless of whether you are playing an open high e string or fretting its octave at the twelth fret. A guitar that is correctly set up will show this on all strings. Setting the action of electric guitars is very easy due to the string adjusters however acoustic guitars have their intonation set at the factory and don't have string adjusters. Adjusting the action of an acoustic should be left to a guitar shop or luthier who specializes in repair and maintenance. 

Though slide guitar is often played in [[Guitar/Alternate Tunings|open chord tunings]], Open G and Open D being the most common, playing slide in standard tuning is also possible and can add a new dimension to your playing. Slide guitar has always provided a fascinating approach to playing the guitar and the sound of the slide has found a home in genres such as Rock and Country.   


==History==
One of the earliest mentions of slide guitar is in W.C.Handy's autobiography &quot;Father Of The Blues&quot;:

&quot;As he played, he pressed a knife on the strings of the guitar in a manner popularized by the Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars&quot;

This is also one of the earliest references to the blues. As you can tell from the quote above the use of the slide in no late-comer to the blues genre and there is large body of work from the 1920s to the present day. No guitarist can confuse the slide playing of Duane Allman with that of Robert Johnson. Each period informs of itself the dictates of taste and style. 

===1930s===
Robert Johnson is cited as the first great slide guitarist. Other famous blues performers had comer before him, Blind &quot;Lemon&quot; Jefferson was a major entertainer during the 1920s but Robert Johnson is considered to be the first major exponent of the slide. During his life-time he only recorded a handful of tracks and though known locally for being a fine entertainer; the world-wide fame that is associated with his name now is more down to later blues fans and guitarists who have sought the roots of the blues.

==Presentation==

With the powers reality check, you try to use &quot;magical&quot; powers (i.e. flying, unlocking doors without touching them, walking through objects, etc.) and see if they work; if they do, then chances are you're dreaming.

As long as you're dreaming and you expect your &quot;magical powers&quot; to work, then they will, and you'll hopefully realize that you must be dreaming.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I'm in a room with a locked door. I &quot;wish&quot; it open, and it opens. I realize I must be dreaming.
* I'm falling off a cliff, and I try to stop falling, and start moving upwards. I start flying, and realize that I must be dreaming.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I'm walking along a path and notice a giant green rat walking along it with me. I vaguely realize that rats are generally not 5 feet long excluding the tail, and generally don't have green fur, but I figure there must be some breed of giant rats that I've never heard of before. I decide to try levitating the rat, and doubtfully try to force the rat to start floating with my mind, but it just keeps walking. I figure that I must be awake after all, and make a note to go look up giant green rats in an encyclopaedia when I get home.
* I'm in the guest bedroom of my grandparents' apartment. I look into the mirror above the chimney and think about transforming into a woman. However, the previous part of my dream was about me being able to transform into a woman, so I thought it was normal when I actually did, and I continued nonlucidly.
* Sometimes when this does work, the lucidity wears off after a couple of minutes and the laws of physics kick back in. Usually this happens when I'm in midflight and it tends to get me killed in undignified ways.

==Presentation==

With the memory reality check, you try to remember what just happened in the past few minutes, and what happened a little bit ago.

In dreams, you'll often skip from one scene to the next with little or no transition, or you might remember something that never happened. If you try to remember what just happened as a reality check, then you might realize that you were just in a completely different place, or you might not be able to remember anything at all from more than a couple minutes ago.

==Examples of this reality check working==

* I was in a forest. Then I was in a kitchen. I didn't notice the change, and I started to get something to eat, but then I saw a dark green light flowing out of the microwave, reminiscent of a forest. I thought back to a few minutes ago and realized I was in that forest then, not this kitchen. I realized I must be dreaming.
* I heard someone in my dream say the phrase, &quot;What language do you dream in?&quot;, and I thought, &quot;Hey, I can't just have pulled that from my head, it must be something I've recently heard!&quot; I started remembering my previous &quot;Waking Day&quot;, and I remembered that a friend told me that same phrase in school last day! And so I realised I was dreaming.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I was in a parking lot near a big truck, and I thought it was mine. However, I remembered coming here on a bike, so I was beginning to think I was dreaming, but then I thought about it a bit more and I discovered a false memory of me coming here in the truck. Though I was still doubting it (I had the feeling it was a false memory, because I was quite sure I came on a bike), I lost the bit of lucidity I had.

=Themes=

One of the most obvious themes in the novel is how important it is for individuals to refrain from rushing through life. In essence, Bradbury makes the point that “you should stop to smell the roses” but more eloquently and meaningfully than this trite platitude is able to do.  Bradbury’s futuristic society consists of many individuals who drive their cars (called beetles) at extremely high velocities, watch interactive TV at extremely high volumes, listen to in-ear radio devices much like an iPod, and rarely pay attention to the small things in life. Clarisse is an exception to this rule, but since she is killed by a car that was speeding down the road, she is nonetheless greatly impacted by this lifestyle.

Another prevalent motif is Bradbury’s opinion that abridged versions or summaries of books lead to the type of society that exists in his novel.  In one of Beatty’s stories about how the world came to be the way it is, he says that great pieces of literature gradually became more condensed until they ceased to be substantial. This is similar to the previously discussed theme. Ironically, study-guides, like the one you're reading, may be an example of the same tendency.

The theme concerning mankind’s failure to learn from its past is more prevalent near the end of the novel.  When the war starts, Granger compares this failure to the endless cycle that a [[en:phoenix|phoenix]] goes through burning  itself and rising from the ashes, but notes that humans, unlike the phoenix, are able to remember the stupid things that they did.

==Information ecologist==

I evolved into the role of '''Information Ecologist''' - now '''Professor of Information Ecology''' - at '''Information Habitat: Where Information Lives''' [http://habitat.igc.org]  in the spring of 1996, in response to a conception of information ecology as an embryonic holistic life science and operating system for sustainability and peace. This evolution took place in the context of the final stages of preparation for the 1996 '''Habitat II''' Conference in Istanbul, for which Information Habitat - an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the UN Economic and Social Council had built and managed the web site and the principal electronic mailing lists. The seeds of information ecology had been planted with the conceoption of '''Information Habitat: Where Information Lives''' in May 1990 at an interfaith '''Caring for Creation''' conference in preparation for the 1992 '''Earth Summit'''. in appreciation of the remarkable transformations taking place in the nature, magnitude and accessibility of information habitats in an era of microcomputers and information and communications technology and the recognition of information and information systems as rapidly evolving new life forms.

'''Information Habitat''' has pioneered the systematic use of information and communications technology in support of broad-based access to and exchange of information, plans and ideas throughout the preparation for the major series of UN Conferences from the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to the 1996 Habitat II Conference, and in the follow-up to the resulting global agreement - especially through the UN Commission for Sustainable Development.

Currrent focus is on the development of an open source, common content interactive platform for the '''NGO Committee on Education''' of the '''CONGO''' - Conference Of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations - incorporating a supportive environment for Wiki spaces, blogs, podcasting, vblogs, etc. , with a focus on the '''United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development''' and the '''International Decade for a Culture of Peace'''. An initial component of the site incorporates an extensive hyperlinked collection - the first of its kind - of several hundred United Nations documents relating to sustainability, a culture of peace, water, human rights, etc. at http://www.un-documents.net

My life's work up to that time had prepared me for the profession of information ecologist. I had been headed for a promising academic career as a mathematical sociologist with degrees in '''mathematics''' and '''economics''' at Cambridge and '''social science research &amp;amp; methodology''' at Johns Hopkins. However I withdrew from academia in 1972 in the context of participation in the Vietnam Peace movement and concern as to the dominance of academia by a military-industrial complex.

I learned much about information ecology in more than thirteen years at the '''Baltimore City Jail''' - as '''librarian''' for eight and a half years, and the remaining five years an an '''administrative analyst''' - and in the course of thirty years of experience with advocacy &amp;amp; activist organizations that focused on peace, health, community development and interfaith dialogue at local, national and international levels.

The '''ecological''' dimensions of my training in information ecology have grown out of a love for the natural environment and my experiences as an '''organic gardener''' - with a passion for composting that I had learned as a child - combined with an appreciation of '''holistic processes'''. Through the recent discovery of and involvement in '''La Perla Gardens'''- beginning with an '''Independence Day Worm Feast''', I have been able to reconnect to the earth in ways that have brought me great joy.

Since May, 1989, my attention had been focused on the preparations for the 1992 '''Earth Summit''' / UNCED, and on the vital role that information technology could play in support of broad-based participation of NGOs in the conference, and I had developed an outline proposal for an '''information, public participation and communications system''' [http://habitat.igc.org/docs/ippcs.htm] that had led to the 1990 Earth Day launch of a &quot;Global Environmental Network&quot; by the UNCED Secretariat, whle as a Co-Chair of the Religious Outreach Committee for the '''1990 Earth Day''' in Baltimore, organized a sunrise interfaith dedication of a fifth verse of the U.S. National Anthem at Fort McHenry, Birthplace of the Star-Spangled Banner - [http://habitat.igc.org/oy-say-can-you-see]

Increasingly a focus has been towards gathering, compiling and organizing eographical information, including maps and satellite images. This has included a 1996 focus on the '''Mesopotamian Marshlands''': Between the Rivers - A Cradle of Civilization in support of the '''New Eden Project''' [http://www.edenagain.org] - and the observation of  Mesopotamian Summer, with the purpose of engaging in dialogue and appreciative inquiry - inter alia making use of a Wiki platform - into the feasiblity of a holistic approach to restoring and regenerating the decimated Marshes, and of the development of an open source wireless Internet Protocol platform for a new knowledge-based civilization. I had begun working on several wikibooks related to the restoration of the Marshes and information ecology. however, much of what I had published has been deleted - although it could be easily regenerated. In the wake of the massve October 2005 '''Kashmir Earthquake''' the gathering and organizing of information, maps and satellite images expanded to addressing the needs and opportunities for open source platforms combined with handheld wireless devices in facilitating coordination of logistics and relief efforts. An immediate '''down-to-earth''' focus is on preparation for an interactive online learning environment, featuring a biodiversity resources map of La Perla Gardens intended to sere as a prototype for use by community gardens, parks, etc anywhere.

Although I have no recognized academic affiliation, I have begun to use the title of '''Professor of Information Ecology''' - using the dictionary definition of &quot;professor&quot; as one who professes [http://www.dictionary.com/professor] - marking a new phase that will focus on teaching information ecology. Since 1996, I had been using the title '''Information Ecologist'''; during these eight years, my focus had been on development of the theory and practice of Information Ecology and believe it is now time for me to begin the task of teaching about information ecology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Python Programming/Navigation|Sequences|Numbers}}

Data types determine whether an object can do something, or whether it just would not make sense.  Other programming languages often determine whether an operation makes sense for an object by making sure the object can never be stored somewhere where the operation will be performed on the object (this [[w:Type_system#Type checking|type system]] is called static typing).  Python does not do that.  Instead it stores the type of an object with the object, and checks when the operation is performed whether that operation makes sense for that object (this is called dynamic typing).

===== Built-in Data types =====
Python's built-in (or standard) data types can be grouped into several classes. Sticking to the hierarchy scheme used in the official Python documentation these are '''numeric types, sequences, sets and mappings''' (and a few more not discussed further here). Some of the types are only available in certain versions of the language as noted below.

*boolean: the type of the built-in values &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. Useful in conditional expressions, and anywhere else you want to represent the truth or falsity of some condition. Mostly interchangeable with the integers 1 and 0. In fact, conditional expressions will accept values of any type, treating special ones like boolean &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, integer 0 and the empty string &lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; as equivalent to &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, and all other values as equivalent to &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. But for safety’s sake, it is best to only use boolean values in these places.

Numeric types:
*int:     Integers; equivalent to C longs in Python 2.x, non-limited length in Python 3.x
*long:    Long integers of non-limited length; exists only in Python 2.x
*float:   Floating-Point numbers, equivalent to C doubles
*complex: Complex Numbers

Sequences:
*str:     String; represented as a sequence of 8-bit characters in Python 2.x, but as a sequence of Unicode characters (in the range of U+0000 - U+10FFFF) in Python 3.x
*byte:   a sequence of integers in the range of 0-255; only available in Python 3.x
*byte array: like bytes, but mutable (see below); only available in Python 3.x
*list
*tuple

Sets:
*set:     an unordered collection of unique objects; available as a standard type since Python 2.6
*frozen set: like set, but immutable (see below); available as a standard type since Python 2.6

Mappings:
*dict:    Python dictionaries, also called hashmaps or associative arrays, which means that an element of the list is associated with a definition, rather like a Map in [[Java]]&lt;br /&gt;

Some others, such as type and callables

===== Mutable vs Immutable Objects =====
In general, data types in Python can be distinguished based on whether objects of the type are mutable or immutable. The content of objects of immutable types cannot be changed after they are created.

{|
| Some ''immutable'' types:
* int, float, long, complex
* str
* bytes
* tuple
* frozen set
| Some ''mutable'' types:
* byte array
* list
* set
* dict
|-
|}

Only mutable objects support methods that change the object in place, such as reassignment of a sequence slice, which will work for lists, but raise an error for tuples and strings.

It is important to understand that variables in Python are really just references to objects in memory. If you assign an object to a variable as below
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
s = 'abc'
l = ['a string', 456, ('a', 'tuple', 'inside', 'a', 'list')]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
all you really do is make this variable (&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt;) point to the object (&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'abc'&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;['a string', 456, ('a', 'tuple', 'inside', 'a', 'list')]&lt;/tt&gt;), which is kept somewhere in memory, as a convenient way of accessing it. If you reassign a variable as below 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 7
s = 'xyz'
l = ['a simpler list', 99, 10]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
you make the variable point to a different object (newly created ones in our examples). As stated above, only mutable objects can be changed in place (&lt;tt&gt;l[0] = 1&lt;/tt&gt; is ok in our example, but &lt;tt&gt;s[0] = 'a'&lt;/tt&gt; raises an error). This becomes tricky, when an operation is not explicitly asking for a change to happen in place, as is the case for the &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt; (increment) operator, for example. When used on an immutable object (as in &lt;tt&gt;a += 1&lt;/tt&gt; or in &lt;tt&gt;s += 'qwertz'&lt;/tt&gt;), Python will silently create a new object and make the variable point to it. However, when used on a mutable object (as in &lt;tt&gt;l += [1,2,3]&lt;/tt&gt;), the object pointed to by the variable will be changed in place. While in most situations, you do not have to know about this different behavior, it is of relevance when several variables are pointing to the same object. In our example, assume you set &lt;tt&gt;p = s&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;m = l&lt;/tt&gt;, then &lt;tt&gt;s += 'etc'&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;l += [9,8,7]&lt;/tt&gt;. This will change &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; and leave &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; unaffected, but will change both &lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; since both point to the same list object. Python's built-in &lt;tt&gt;id()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which returns a unique object identifier for a given variable name, can be used to trace what is happening under the hood.
&lt;br /&gt;
Typically, this behavior of Python causes confusion in functions. As an illustration, consider this code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def append_to_sequence (myseq):
    myseq += (9,9,9)
    return myseq

t=(1,2,3)     # tuples are immutable
l=[1,2,3]     # lists are mutable

u=append_to_sequence(t)
m=append_to_sequence(l)

print('t = ', t)
print('u = ', u)
print('l = ', l)
print('m = ', m)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This will give the (usually unintended) output:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;t =  (1, 2, 3)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;u =  (1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;l =  [1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;m =  [1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 9]&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;myseq&lt;/tt&gt; is a local variable of the &lt;tt&gt;append_to_sequence&lt;/tt&gt; function, but when this function gets called, &lt;tt&gt;myseq&lt;/tt&gt; will nevertheless point to the same object as the variable that we pass in (&lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; in our example). If that object is immutable (like a tuple), there is no problem. The += operator will cause the creation of a new tuple, and &lt;tt&gt;myseq&lt;/tt&gt; will be set to point to it. However, if we pass in a reference to a mutable object, that object will be manipulated in place (so &lt;tt&gt;myseq&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt;, in our case, end up pointing to the same list object).

===== Creating Objects of Defined Types =====
Literal integers can be entered in three ways:
*decimal numbers can be entered directly
*hexadecimal numbers can be entered by prepending a 0x or 0X (0xff is hex FF, or 255 in decimal)
*the format of octal literals depends on the version of Python:
:*Python 2.x: octals can be entered by prepending a 0 (0732 is octal 732, or 474 in decimal)
:*Python 3.x: octals can be entered by prepending a 0o or 0O (0o732 is octal 732, or 474 in decimal)

Floating point numbers can be entered directly.

Long integers are entered either directly (1234567891011121314151617181920 is a long integer) or by appending an L (0L is a long integer).  Computations involving short integers that overflow are automatically turned into long integers.

Complex numbers are entered by adding a real number and an imaginary one, which is entered by appending a j (i.e. 10+5j is a complex number.  So is 10j).  Note that j by itself does not constitute a number.  If this is desired, use 1j.

Strings can be either single or triple quoted strings.  The difference is in the starting and ending delimiters, and in that single quoted strings cannot span more than one line.  Single quoted strings are entered by entering either a single quote (') or a double quote (&quot;) followed by its match.  So therefore
 'foo' works, and
 &quot;moo&quot; works as well,
      but
 'bar&quot; does not work, and
 &quot;baz' does not work either.
 &quot;quux&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is right out.

Triple quoted strings are like single quoted strings, but can span more than one line.  Their starting and ending delimiters must also match.  They are entered with three consecutive single or double quotes, so
 &lt;nowiki&gt;'''foo'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; works, and
 &quot;&quot;&quot;moo&quot;&quot;&quot; works as well,
      but
 '&quot;'bar'&quot;' does not work, and
 &quot;&quot;&quot;baz&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not work either.
 '&quot;'quux&quot;'&quot; is right out.

Tuples are entered in parentheses, with commas between the entries:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
(10, 'Mary had a little lamb')
&lt;/source&gt;
Also, the parenthesis can be left out when it's not ambiguous to do so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
10, 'whose fleece was as white as snow'
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that one-element tuples can be entered by surrounding the entry with parentheses and adding a comma like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
('this is a stupid tuple',)
&lt;/source&gt;

Lists are similar, but with brackets:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
['abc', 1,2,3]
&lt;/source&gt;

Dicts are created by surrounding with curly braces a list of key/value pairs separated from each other by a colon and from the other entries with commas:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
{ 'hello': 'world', 'weight': 'African or European?' }
&lt;/source&gt;

Any of these composite types can contain any other, to any depth:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
((((((((('bob',),['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']), { 'hello' : 'world' } ),),),),),),)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Null object==
The Python analogue of null pointer known from other programming languages is ''None''. ''None'' is not a null pointer or a null reference but an actual object of which there is only one instance. One of the uses of ''None'' is in default argument values of functions, for which see [[../Functions#Default_Argument_Values]]. Comparisons to ''None'' are usually made using ''is'' rather than ==.

Testing for None and assignment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if item is None:
  ...
  another = None

if not item is None:
  ...

if item is not None: # Also possible
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Using None in a default argument value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def log(message, type = None):
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

===Variables===

Variables in Python are automatically declared by assignment.  Variables are always references to objects, and are never typed.  Variables exist only in the current scope or global scope.  When they go out of scope, the variables are destroyed, but the objects to which they refer are not (unless the number of references to the object drops to zero).

Scope is delineated by function and class blocks.  Both functions and their scopes can be nested.  So therefore

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def foo():
    def bar():
        x = 5 # x is now in scope
        return x + y # y is defined in the enclosing scope later
    y = 10
    return bar() # now that y is defined, bar's scope includes y
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when this code is tested,

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
15
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;pyshell#26&gt;&quot;, line 1, in -toplevel-
    bar()
NameError: name 'bar' is not defined
&lt;/source&gt;

The name 'bar' is not found because a higher scope does not have access to the names lower in the hierarchy.

It is a common pitfall to fail to lookup an attribute (such as a method) of an object (such as a container) referenced by a variable before the variable is assigned the object.  In its most common form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in range(10):
         y.append(x) # append is an attribute of lists

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;pyshell#46&gt;&quot;, line 2, in -toplevel-
    y.append(x)
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, to correct this problem, one must add y = [] before the for loop.

==Basics==
Python math works like you would expect.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; x * y
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; x + y
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; x * y + z
11
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x + y) * z
25
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that Python adheres to the [[w:Order of operations | PEMDAS order of operations]].

==Powers==
There is a built in exponentiation operator **, which can take either integers, floating point or complex numbers.  This occupies its proper place in the order of operations.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2**8
256
&lt;/source&gt;

==Division and Type Conversion==

For Python 2.x, dividing two integers or longs uses integer division, also known as &quot;floor division&quot; (applying the [[w:Floor function|floor function]] after division.  So, for example, 5 / 2 is 2. Using &quot;/&quot; to do division this way is deprecated; if you want floor division, use &quot;//&quot; (available in Python 2.2 and later). 

&quot;/&quot; does &quot;true division&quot; for floats and complex numbers; for example, 5.0/2.0 is 2.5.

For Python 3.x, &quot;/&quot; does &quot;true division&quot; for all types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.3/whatsnew/node7.html What's New in Python 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/ PEP 238 -- Changing the Division Operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dividing by or into a floating point number (there are no fractional types in Python) will cause Python to use true division.  To coerce an integer to become a float, 'float()' with the integer as a parameter

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; float(x)
5.0
&lt;/source&gt;

This can be generalized for other numeric types: int(), complex(), long().

Beware that due to the limitations of [[w:floating point|floating point arithmetic]], rounding errors can cause unexpected results.  For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; print 0.6/0.2
 3.0
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print 0.6//0.2
 2.0

==Modulo==
The modulus (remainder of the division of the two operands, rather than the quotient) can be found using the % operator, or by the divmod builtin function.  The divmod function returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10%7
3
&lt;/source&gt;

==Negation==
Unlike some other languages, variables can be negated directly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; -x
-5
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comparison==

Numbers, strings and other types can be compared for equality/inequality and ordering:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 == 3
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 == 3
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 &lt; 3
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;aa&quot;
True
&lt;/source&gt;

==Identity==
The operators &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;is not&lt;/code&gt; test for object identity: &lt;code&gt;x is y&lt;/code&gt; is true if and only if x and y are references to the same object in memory. &lt;code&gt;x is not y&lt;/code&gt; yields the inverse truth value.
Note that an identity test is more stringent than an equality test since two distinct objects may have the same value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] == [1,2,3]
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] is [1,2,3]
False
&lt;/source&gt;

For the built-in [[Python_Programming/Data_types#Mutable_vs_Immutable_Objects|immutable data types]] (like int, str and tuple) Python uses caching mechanisms to improve performance, i.e., the interpreter may decide to reuse an existing immutable object instead of generating a new one with the same value. The details of object caching are subject to changes between different Python versions and are not guaranteed to be system-independent, so identity checks on immutable objects like &lt;code&gt;'hello' is 'hello'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(1,2,3) is (1,2,3)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4 is 2**2&lt;/code&gt; may give different results on different machines.

==Augmented Assignment==
There is shorthand for assigning the output of an operation to one of the inputs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; x # 2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; x *= 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; x # 2 * 3
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; x += 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; x # 2 * 3 + 4
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; x /= 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; x # (2 * 3 + 4) / 5
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; x **= 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; x # ((2 * 3 + 4) / 5) ** 2
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; x %= 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; x # ((2 * 3 + 4) / 5) ** 2 % 3
1

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'repeat this  '
&gt;&gt;&gt; x  # repeat this
repeat this
&gt;&gt;&gt; x *= 3  # fill with x repeated three times
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
repeat this  repeat this  repeat this
&lt;/source&gt;

==Boolean==
or:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if a or b:
    do_this
else:
    do_this
&lt;/source&gt;

and:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if a and b:
    do_this
else:
    do_this
&lt;/source&gt;

not:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if not a:
    do_this
else:
    do_this
&lt;/source&gt;
The order of operations here is: &quot;not&quot; first, &quot;and&quot; second, &quot;or&quot; third. In particular, &quot;True or True and False or False&quot; becomes &quot;True or False or False&quot; which is True. 

Caution, Boolean operators are valid on things other than Booleans; for instance &quot;1 and 6&quot; will return 6. Specifically, &quot;and&quot; returns either the first value considered to be false, or the last value if all are considered true. &quot;or&quot; returns the first true value, or the last value if all are considered false.

==Exercises==
#Use Python to calculate &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{2^2}}=65536&lt;/math&gt;.
#Use Python to calculate &lt;math&gt;\frac{(3+2)^4}{7}\approx 89.285&lt;/math&gt;.
#Use Python to calculate 11111111111111111111+22222222222222222222, but in one line of code with at most 15 characters. (Hint: each of those numbers is 20 digits long, so you have to find some other way to input those numbers)
#Exactly one of the following expressions evaluates to &quot;cat&quot;; the other evaluates to &quot;dog&quot;. Trace the logic to determine which one is which, then check your answer using Python.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
1 and &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;dog&quot;
0 and &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;dog&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Function Calls==
A ''callable object'' is an object that can accept some arguments (also called parameters) and possibly return an object (often a tuple containing multiple objects).

A function is the simplest callable object in Python, but there are others, such as [[Python Programming/Classes|classes]] or certain class instances.

====Defining Functions====
A function is defined in Python by the following format:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def functionname(arg1, arg2, ...):
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def functionname(arg1,arg2):
...     return arg1+arg2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = functionname(24,24) # Result: 48
&lt;/source&gt;

If a function takes no arguments, it must still include the parentheses, but without anything in them:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def functionname():
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

The arguments in the function definition bind the arguments passed at function invocation (i.e. when the function is called), which are called actual parameters, to the names given when the function is defined, which are called formal parameters.  The interior of the function has no knowledge of the names given to the actual parameters; the names of the actual parameters may not even be accessible (they could be inside another function).

A function can 'return' a value, for example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def square(x):
    return x*x
&lt;/source&gt;

A function can define variables within the function body, which are considered 'local' to the function.  The locals together with the arguments comprise all the variables within the scope of the function.  Any names within the function are unbound when the function returns or reaches the end of the function body.

You can '''return multiple values''' as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def first2items(list1):
  return list1[0], list1[1]
a, b = first2items([&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;universe&quot;])
print a + &quot; &quot; + b
&lt;/source&gt;
Keywords: returning multiple values, multiple return values.

===Declaring Arguments===
When calling a function that takes some values for further processing, we need to send some values as Function '''Arguments'''. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def find_max(a,b):
   if(a&gt;b):
      print &quot;a is greater than b&quot;
   else:
      print &quot;b is greater than a&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; find_max(30,45)  #Here (30,45) are the arguments passing for finding max between this two numbers
The ouput will be: 45 is greater than 30
&lt;/source&gt;
====Default Argument Values====
If any of the formal parameters in the function definition are declared with the format &quot;arg = value,&quot; then you will have the option of not specifying a value for those arguments when calling the function.  If you do not specify a value, then that parameter will have the default value given when the function executes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def display_message(message, truncate_after=4):
...     print message[:truncate_after]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; display_message(&quot;message&quot;)
mess
&gt;&gt;&gt; display_message(&quot;message&quot;, 6)
messag
&lt;/source&gt;

Links:
* [http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values 4.7.1. Default Argument Values], The Python Tutorial, docs.python.org

====Variable-Length Argument Lists====
Python allows you to declare two special arguments which allow you to create arbitrary-length argument lists.  This means that each time you call the function, you can specify any number of arguments above a certain number.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def function(first,second,*remaining):
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

When calling the above function, you must provide value for each of the first two arguments.  However, since the third parameter is marked with an asterisk, any actual parameters after the first two will be packed into a tuple and bound to &quot;remaining.&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_tail(first,*tail):
...     print tail
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_tail(1, 5, 2, &quot;omega&quot;)
(5, 2, 'omega')
&lt;/source&gt;

If we declare a formal parameter prefixed with ''two'' asterisks, then it will be bound to a dictionary containing any keyword arguments in the actual parameters which do not correspond to any formal parameters.  For example, consider the function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def make_dictionary(max_length=10, **entries):
    return dict([(key, entries[key]) for i, key in enumerate(entries.keys()) if i &lt; max_length])
&lt;/source&gt;

If we call this function with any keyword arguments other than max_length, they will be placed in the dictionary &quot;entries.&quot;  If we include the keyword argument of max_length, it will be bound to the
formal parameter max_length, as usual.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; make_dictionary(max_length=2, key1=5, key2=7, key3=9)
{'key3': 9, 'key2': 7}
&lt;/source&gt;

Links:
* [http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists 4.7.3. Arbitrary Argument Lists], The Python Tutorial, docs.python.org

====By Value and by Reference====
Objects passed as arguments to functions are passed ''by reference''; they are not being copied around. Thus, passing a large list as an argument does not involve copying all its members to a new location in memory. Note that even integers are objects. However, the distinction of ''by value'' and ''by reference'' present in some other programming languages often serves to distinguish whether the passed arguments can be ''actually changed'' by the called function and whether the ''calling function can see the changes''.

Passed objects of ''mutable'' types such as lists and dictionaries can be changed by the called function and the changes are visible to the calling function. Passed objects of ''immutable'' types such as integers and strings cannot be changed by the called function; the calling function can be certain that the called function will not change them. For mutability, see also [[../Data_Types#Mutable_vs_Immutable_Objects|Data Types]] chapter.

An example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def appendItem(ilist, item):
  ilist.append(item) # Modifies ilist in a way visible to the caller

def replaceItems(ilist, newcontentlist):
  del ilist[:]                 # Modification visible to the caller
  ilist.extend(newcontentlist) # Modification visible to the caller
  ilist = [5, 6] # No outside effect; lets the local ilist point to a new list object,
                 # losing the reference to the list object passed as an argument
def clearSet(iset):
  iset.clear()

def tryToTouchAnInteger(iint):
  iint += 1 # No outside effect; lets the local iint to point to a new int object,
            # losing the reference to the int object passed as an argument
  print &quot;iint inside:&quot;,iint # 4 if iint was 3 on function entry 

list1 = [1, 2]
appendItem(list1, 3)
print list1 # [1, 2, 3]
replaceItems(list1, [3, 4])
print list1 # [3, 4]
set1 = set([1, 2])
clearSet(set1 )
print set1 # set([])
int1 = 3
tryToTouchAnInteger(int1)
print int1 # 3
&lt;/source&gt;

===Preventing Argument Change===
An argument cannot be declared to be constant, not to be changed by the called function. If an argument is of an immutable type, it cannot be changed anyway, but if it is of a mutable type such as list, the calling function is at the mercy of the called function. Thus, if the calling function wants to make sure a passed list does not get changed, it has to pass a copy of the list.

An example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def evilGetLength(ilist):
  length = len(ilist)
  del ilist[:] # Muhaha: clear the list
  return length

list1 = [1, 2]
print evilGetLength(list1[:]) # Pass a copy of list1
print list1
list1 = [1, 2]
print evilGetLength(list1) # list1 gets cleared
print list1
list1 = []
&lt;/source&gt;

===Calling Functions===
A function can be called by appending the arguments in parentheses to the function name, or an empty matched set of parentheses if the function takes no arguments.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
foo()
square(3)
bar(5, x)
&lt;/source&gt;

A function's return value can be used by assigning it to a variable, like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
x = foo()
y = bar(5,x)
&lt;/source&gt;

As shown above, when calling a function you can specify the parameters by name and you can do so in any order
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def display_message(message, start=0, end=4):
   print message[start:end]

display_message(&quot;message&quot;, end=3)
&lt;/source&gt;

This above is valid and start will have the default value of 0.  A restriction placed on this is after the first named argument then all arguments after it must also be named.  The following is not valid
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
display_message(end=5, start=1, &quot;my message&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

because the third argument (&quot;my message&quot;) is an unnamed argument.

==Closures==
A ''closure'' is a nested function with an after-return access to the data of the outer function, where the nested function is returned by the outer function as a function object. Thus, even when the outer function has finished its execution after being called, the closure function returned by it can refer to the values of the variables that the outer function had when it defined the closure function.

An example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def adder(outer_argument): # outer function
  def adder_inner(inner_argument): # inner function, nested function
    return outer_argument + inner_argument # Notice outer_argument
  return adder_inner
add5 = adder(5) # a function that adds 5 to its argument
add7 = adder(7) # a function that adds 7 to its argument
print add5(3) # prints 8
print add7(3) # prints 10
&lt;/source&gt;

Closures are possible in Python because functions are ''first-class objects''. A function is merely an object of type function. Being an object means it is possible to pass a function object (an uncalled function) around as argument or as return value or to assign another name to the function object. A unique feature that makes closure useful is that the enclosed function may use the names defined in the parent function's scope.

==Lambda Expressions==

A lambda is an anonymous (unnamed) function. It is used primarily to write very short functions that are a hassle to define in the normal way. A function like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def add(a, b):
...    return a + b
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; add(4, 3)
7
&lt;/source&gt;

may also be defined using lambda

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (lambda a, b: a + b)(4, 3)
7
&lt;/source&gt;

Lambda is often used as an argument to other functions that expects a function object, such as sorted()'s 'key' argument. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted([[3, 4], [3, 5], [1, 2], [7, 3]], key=lambda x: x[1])
[[1, 2], [7, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5]]
&lt;/source&gt;

The lambda form is often useful as a closure, such as illustrated in the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def attribution(name):
...    return lambda x: x + ' -- ' + name
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; pp = attribution('John')
&gt;&gt;&gt; pp('Dinner is in the fridge')
'Dinner is in the fridge -- John'
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the lambda function can use the values of variables from the [[Python Programming/Scoping|scope]] in which it was created (like pre and post). This is the essence of closure.

===Generator Functions===
When discussing loops, you can across the concept of an ''iterator''. This yields in turn each element of some sequence, rather than the entire sequence at once, allowing you to deal with sequences much larger than might be able to fit in memory at once.

You can create your own iterators, by defining what is known as a ''generator function''. To illustrate the usefulness of this, let us start by considering a simple function to return the ''concatenation'' of two lists:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def concat(a, b) :
    return a + b
#end concat

print concat([5, 4, 3], [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;])
# prints [5, 4, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']
&lt;/source&gt;

Imagine wanting to do something like
&lt;code&gt;concat(range(0, 1000000), range(1000000, 2000000))
&lt;/code&gt;

That would work, but it would consume a lot of memory.

Consider an alternative definition, which takes two iterators as arguments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def concat(a, b) :
    for i in a :
        yield i
    #end for
    for i in b :
        yield i
    #end b
#end concat
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the use of the '''yield''' statement, instead of '''return'''. We can now use this something like

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in concat(xrange(0, 1000000), xrange(1000000, 2000000))
    print i
#end for
&lt;/source&gt;

and print out an awful lot of numbers, without using a lot of memory at all.

{{Python Programming/Note|You can still pass a list or other sequence type wherever Python expects an iterator (like to an argument of your &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; function); this will still work, and makes it easy not to have to worry about the difference where you don’t need to.}}

There are two ways to multiply two vectors together, the dot product and the cross product. We have already studied the dot product of two vectors, which results in a scalar or single number.

The cross product of two vectors results in a third vector, and is written symbolically as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross product of two vectors is defined to be perpendicular to the plane defined by these vectors. However, this doesn't tell us whether the resulting vector points upward out of the plane or downward. This ambiguity is resolved using the right-hand rule:

#Point the uncurled fingers of your right hand along the direction of the first vector '''A'''.
#Rotate your arm until you can curl your fingers in the direction of the second vector '''B'''.
#Your stretched out thumb now points in the direction of the cross product vector '''A'''&amp;times;'''B'''.

The magnitude of the cross product is given by

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{A}\times \mathbf{B}|=|\mathbf{A}||\mathbf{B}|\sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

where |'''A'''| and |'''B'''| are the magnitudes of '''A''' and '''B''', and &amp;theta; is the angle between these two vectors. Note that the magnitude of the cross product is zero when the vectors are parallel or anti-parallel, and maximum when they are perpendicular. This contrasts with the dot product, which is maximum for parallel vectors and zero for perpendicular vectors.

Notice that the cross product does not commute, i. e., the order of the vectors is important. In particular, it is easy to show using the right-hand rule that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\times \mathbf{B}= -\mathbf{B}\times \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

An alternate way to compute the cross product is most useful when the two vectors are expressed in terms of components,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}= \mathbf{A}\times \mathbf{B}= \begin{vmatrix} 
\mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\ A_x &amp; A_y &amp; A_z \\ B_x &amp; B_y &amp; B_z
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the determinant is expanded as if all the components were numbers, giving
:&lt;math&gt;C_x=A_y B_z -A_z B_y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_y=A_z B_x -A_x B_z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_z=A_x B_y -A_y B_z\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Note how the positive terms possess a forward alphabetical direction, {{nowrap begin}}''xyzxyzx...''{{nowrap end}} (with x following z): 


With the cross product we can also multiply three vectors together, in two different ways.

We can take the dot product of a vector with a cross product, a triple scalar product,
:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{A} \cdot (\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{C}) = 
(\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}) \cdot \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of this product is the volume of the parallelpiped defined by the three vectors, '''A''', '''B''', and '''C'''

Alternately, we can take the cross product of a vector with a cross product, a triple vector product, which can be simplified to a combination of dot products.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \times (\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{C})
=(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{C}) \mathbf{B} 
-(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}) \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;
This form is easier to do calculations with.

The triple vector product is '''not''' associative.
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \times (\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{C})
\ne (\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}) \times \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;

A nice as well as a useful way to denote the '''cross product''' is using the indicial notation

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C = A \times B} = \; \epsilon^{ijk} \, A_j \, B_k \, \hat e_i &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon^{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the Levi-Civita alternating symbol and &lt;math&gt;\hat e_i&lt;/math&gt; is either of the unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat i, \hat j, \hat k&lt;/math&gt;. (A good exercise to convince yourself would be to use this expression and see if you can get '''C = A x B''' as defined before.)</text>

Classes are a way of aggregating similar data and functions.  A class is basically a scope inside which various code (especially function definitions) is executed, and the locals to this scope become ''attributes'' of the class, and of any objects constructed by this class.  An object constructed by a class is called an ''instance'' of that class.

===Defining a Class===
To define a class, use the following format:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class ClassName:
    &quot;Here is an explanation about your class&quot;
    pass
&lt;/source&gt;

The capitalization in this class definition is the convention, but is not required by the language. It's usually good to add at least a short explanation of what your class is supposed to do. The pass statement in the code above is just to say to the python interpreter just go on and do nothing. You can remove it as soon as you are adding your first statement.

===Instance Construction===
The class is a callable object that constructs an instance of the class when called. Let's say we create a class Foo.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Foo:
    &quot;Foo is our new toy.&quot;
    pass
&lt;/source&gt;

To construct an instance of the class, Foo, &quot;call&quot; the class object:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
f = Foo()
&lt;/source&gt;

This constructs an instance of class Foo and creates a reference to it in f.

===Class Members===

In order to access the member of an instance of a class, use the syntax &lt;class instance&gt;.&lt;member&gt;.  It is also possible to access the members of the class definition with &lt;class name&gt;.&lt;member&gt;.

====Methods====
A method is a function within a class.  The first argument (methods must always take at least one argument) is always the instance of the class on which the function is invoked.  For example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo:
...     def setx(self, x):
...         self.x = x
...     def bar(self):
...         print self.x
&lt;/source&gt;

If this code were executed, nothing would happen, at least until an instance of Foo were constructed, and then bar were called on that instance.

====Invoking Methods====
Calling a method is much like calling a function, but instead of passing the instance as the first parameter like the list of formal parameters suggests, use the function as an attribute of the instance.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.setx(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.bar()
&lt;/source&gt;

This will output
 5

It is possible to call the method on an arbitrary object, by using it as an attribute of the defining class instead of an instance of that class, like so:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.setx(f,5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.bar(f)
&lt;/source&gt;

This will have the same output.

====Dynamic Class Structure====

As shown by the method setx above, the members of a Python class can change during runtime, not just their values, unlike classes in languages like C or Java.  We can even delete f.x after running the code above.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; del f.x
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.bar()
&lt;/source&gt;
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 5, in bar
 AttributeError: Foo instance has no attribute 'x'

Another effect of this is that we can change the definition of the Foo class during program execution.  In the code below, we create a member of the Foo class definition named y.  If we then create a new instance of Foo, it will now have this new member.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.y = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; g = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.y
10
&lt;/source&gt;

=====Viewing Class Dictionaries=====

At the heart of all this is a [[Python Programming/Dictionaries|dictionary]] that can be accessed by &quot;vars(ClassName)&quot;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(g)
{}
&lt;/source&gt;

At first, this output makes no sense.  We just saw that g had the member y, so why isn't it in the member dictionary?  If you remember, though, we put y in the class definition, Foo, not g.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(Foo)
{'y': 10, 'bar': &lt;function bar at 0x4d6a3c&gt;, '__module__': '__main__',
 'setx': &lt;function setx at 0x4d6a04&gt;, '__doc__': None}
&lt;/source&gt;

And there we have all the members of the Foo class definition.  When Python checks for g.member, it first checks g's vars dictionary for &quot;member,&quot; then Foo.  If we create a new member of g, it will be added to g's dictionary, but not Foo's.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.setx(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(g)
{'x': 5}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if we now assign a value to g.y, we are not assigning that value to Foo.y.  Foo.y will still be 10, but g.y will now override Foo.y

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.y = 9
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(g)
{'y': 9, 'x': 5}
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(Foo)
{'y': 10, 'bar': &lt;function bar at 0x4d6a3c&gt;, '__module__': '__main__',
 'setx': &lt;function setx at 0x4d6a04&gt;, '__doc__': None}
&lt;/source&gt;

Sure enough, if we check the values:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.y
9
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.y
10
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that f.y will also be 10, as Python won't find 'y' in vars(f), so it will get the value of 'y' from vars(Foo).

Some may have also noticed that the methods in Foo appear in the class dictionary along with the x and y.  If you remember from the section on [[Python_Programming/Functions#Lambda_expressions|lambda functions]], we can treat functions just like variables.  This means that we can assign methods to a class during runtime in the same way we assigned variables.  If you do this, though, remember that if we call a method of a class instance, the first parameter passed to the method will always be the class instance itself.

=====Changing Class Dictionaries=====

We can also access the members dictionary of a class using the __dict__ member of the class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.__dict__
{'y': 9, 'x': 5}
&lt;/source&gt;

If we add, remove, or change key-value pairs from g.__dict__, this has the same effect as if we had made those changes to the members of g.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.__dict__['z'] = -4
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.z
-4
&lt;/source&gt;

===New Style Classes===
New style classes were introduced in python 2.2.  A new-style class is a class that has a built-in as its base, most commonly object.  At a low level, a major difference between old and new classes is their type.  Old class instances were all of type &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt;.  New style class instances will return the same thing as x.__class__ for their type.  This puts user defined classes on a level playing field with built-ins.  Old/Classic classes are slated to disappear in Python 3.  With this in mind all development should use new style classes.  New Style classes also add constructs like properties and static methods familiar to Java programmers.

Old/Classic Class

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class ClassicFoo:
...     def __init__(self):
...         pass
&lt;/source&gt;

New Style Class

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class NewStyleFoo(object):
...     def __init__(self):
...         pass
&lt;/source&gt;

====Properties====
Properties are attributes with getter and setter methods.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SpamWithProperties(object):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.__egg = &quot;MyEgg&quot;
...     def get_egg(self):
...         return self.__egg
...     def set_egg(self, egg):
...         self.__egg = egg
...     egg = property(get_egg, set_egg)

&gt;&gt;&gt; sp = SpamWithProperties()
&gt;&gt;&gt; sp.egg
'MyEgg'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sp.egg = &quot;Eggs With Spam&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; sp.egg
'Eggs With Spam'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

and since Python 2.6, with @property decorator

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SpamWithProperties(object):
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.__egg = &quot;MyEgg&quot;
...     @property
...     def egg(self):
...         return self.__egg
...     @egg.setter
...     def egg(self, egg):
...         self.__egg = egg
&lt;/source&gt;

====Static Methods====
Static methods in Python are just like their counterparts in C++ or Java.  Static methods have no &quot;self&quot; argument and don't require you to instantiate the class before using them.  They can be defined using staticmethod()

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class StaticSpam(object):
...     def StaticNoSpam():
...         print &quot;You can't have have the spam, spam, eggs and spam without any spam... that's disgusting&quot;
...     NoSpam = staticmethod(StaticNoSpam)

&gt;&gt;&gt; StaticSpam.NoSpam()
You can't have have the spam, spam, eggs and spam without any spam... that's disgusting
&lt;/source&gt;

They can also be defined using the function decorator @staticmethod.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class StaticSpam(object):
...     @staticmethod
...     def StaticNoSpam():
...         print &quot;You can't have have the spam, spam, eggs and spam without any spam... that's disgusting&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Inheritance===
Like all object oriented languages, Python provides for inheritance.  Inheritance is a simple concept by which a class can extend the facilities of another class, or in Python's case, multiple other classes.  Use the following format for this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class ClassName(superclass1,superclass2,superclass3,...):
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

The subclass will then have all the members of its superclasses.  If a method is defined in the subclass and in the superclass, the member in the subclass will override the one in the superclass.  In order to use the method defined in the superclass, it is necessary to call the method as an attribute on the defining class, as in Foo.setx(f,5) above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo:
...     def bar(self):
...         print &quot;I'm doing Foo.bar()&quot;
...     x = 10
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar(Foo):
...     def bar(self):
...         print &quot;I'm doing Bar.bar()&quot;
...         Foo.bar(self)
...     y = 9
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; g = Bar()
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bar.bar(g)
I'm doing Bar.bar()
I'm doing Foo.bar()
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.y
9
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.x
10
&lt;/source&gt;

Once again, we can see what's going on under the hood by looking at the class dictionaries.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(g)
{}
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(Bar)
{'y': 9, '__module__': '__main__', 'bar': &lt;function bar at 0x4d6a04&gt;,
 '__doc__': None}
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(Foo)
{'x': 10, '__module__': '__main__', 'bar': &lt;function bar at 0x4d6994&gt;,
 '__doc__': None}
&lt;/source&gt;

When we call g.x, it first looks in the vars(g) dictionary, as usual.  Also as above, it checks vars(Bar) next, since g is an instance of Bar.  However, thanks to inheritance, Python will check vars(Foo) if it doesn't find x in vars(Bar).

===Special Methods===
There are a number of methods which have reserved names which are used for special purposes like mimicking numerical or container operations, among other things.  All of these names begin and end with two underscores.  It is convention that methods beginning with a single underscore are 'private' to the scope they are introduced within.

====Initialization and Deletion====

=====__init__=====
One of these purposes is constructing an instance, and the special name for this is '__init__'.  __init__() is called before an instance is returned (it is not necessary to return the instance manually).  As an example,
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print 'A.__init__()'
a = A()
&lt;/source&gt;

outputs
 A.__init__()

__init__() can take arguments, in which case it is necessary to pass arguments to the class in order to create an instance.  For example,
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Foo:
    def __init__ (self, printme):
        print printme
foo = Foo('Hi!')
&lt;/source&gt;

outputs
 Hi!
Here is an example showing the difference between using __init__() and not using __init__():
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Foo:
    def __init__ (self, x):
         print x
foo = Foo('Hi!')
class Foo2:
    def setx(self, x):
        print x
f = Foo2()
Foo2.setx(f,'Hi!')
&lt;/source&gt;

outputs
 Hi!
 Hi!

=====__del__=====
Similarly, '__del__' is called when an instance is destroyed; e.g. when it is no longer referenced.

====Representation====

{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot; |
=====__str__=====
Converting an object to a string, as with the print statement or with the str() conversion function, can be overridden by overriding __str__. Usually, __str__ returns a formatted version of the objects content. This will NOT usually be something that can be executed.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Bar:
    def __init__ (self, iamthis):
        self.iamthis = iamthis
    def __str__ (self):
        return self.iamthis
bar = Bar('apple')
print bar
&lt;/source&gt;

outputs
 apple

=====__repr__=====
This function is much like __str__(). If __str__ is not present but this one is, this function's output is used instead for printing.
__repr__ is used to return a representation of the object in string form. In general, it can be executed to get back the original object.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Bar:
    def __init__ (self, iamthis):
        self.iamthis = iamthis
    def __repr__(self):
        return &quot;Bar('%s')&quot; % self.iamthis
bar = Bar('apple')
bar
&lt;/source&gt;

outputs (note the difference: now is not necessary to put it inside a print)
 Bar('apple')

====Attributes====

{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot; |
=====__setattr__=====
This is the function which is in charge of setting attributes of a class.  It is provided with the name and value of the variables being assigned.  Each class, of course, comes with a default __setattr__ which simply sets the value of the variable, but we can override it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Unchangable:
...    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
...        print &quot;Nice try&quot;
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; u = Unchangable()
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.x = 9
Nice try
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.x
&lt;/source&gt;
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
 AttributeError: Unchangable instance has no attribute 'x'

=====__getattr___=====
Similar to __setattr__, except this function is called when we try to access a class member, and the default simply returns the value.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class HiddenMembers:
...     def __getattr__(self, name):
...         return &quot;You don't get to see &quot; + name
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; h = HiddenMembers()
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.anything
&quot;You don't get to see anything&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=====__delattr__=====
This function is called to delete an attribute.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Permanent:
...     def __delattr__(self, name):
...         print name, &quot;cannot be deleted&quot;
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Permanent()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.x = 9
&gt;&gt;&gt; del p.x
x cannot be deleted
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.x
9
&lt;/source&gt;

|}
|}

====Operator Overloading====

Operator overloading allows us to use the built-in Python syntax and operators to call functions which we define.

=====Binary Operators=====


{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot; |
If a class has the __add__ function, we can use the '+' operator to add instances of the class.  This will call __add__ with the two instances of the class passed as parameters, and the return value will be the result of the addition.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class FakeNumber:
...     n = 5
...     def __add__(A,B):
...         return A.n + B.n
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = FakeNumber()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = FakeNumber()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.n = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; c + d
12
&lt;/source&gt;

To override the [[Python Programming/Operators#Augmented Assignment|augmented assignment]] operators, merely add 'i' in front of the normal binary operator, i.e. for '+=' use '__iadd__' instead of '__add__'.  The function will be given one argument, which will be the object on the right side of the augmented assignment operator.  The returned value of the function will then be assigned to the object on the left of the operator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.__imul__ = lambda B: B.n - 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; c *= d
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
1
&lt;/source&gt;

It is important to note that the [[Python Programming/Operators#Augmented Assignment|augmented assignment]] operators will also use the normal operator functions if the augmented operator function hasn't been set directly.  This will work as expected, with &quot;__add__&quot; being called for &quot;+=&quot; and so on.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = FakeNumber()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c += d
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
12
&lt;/source&gt;

|}

=====Unary Operators=====


{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot; |
Unary operators will be passed simply the instance of the class that they are called on.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; FakeNumber.__neg__ = lambda A : A.n + 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; -d
13

|-

|-

|-

|-

|}
|}

=====Item Operators=====


{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:75%;&quot; |
It is also possible in Python to override the [[Python Programming/Strings#Indexing and Slicing|indexing and slicing]] operators.  This allows us to use the class[i] and class[a:b] syntax on our own objects.

The simplest form of item operator is __getitem__.  This takes as a parameter the instance of the class, then the value of the index.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class FakeList:
...     def __getitem__(self,index):
...         return index * 2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = FakeList()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f['a']
'aa'
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also define a function for the syntax associated with assigning a value to an item.  The parameters for this function include the value being assigned, in addition to the parameters from __getitem__

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class FakeList:
...     def __setitem__(self,index,value):
...         self.string = index + &quot; is now &quot; + value
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = FakeList()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f['a'] = 'gone'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.string
'a is now gone'
&lt;/source&gt;

We can do the same thing with slices.  Once again, each syntax has a different parameter list associated with it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class FakeList:
...     def __getslice___(self,start,end):
...         return str(start) + &quot; to &quot; + str(end)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = FakeList()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f[1:4]
'1 to 4'
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep in mind that one or both of the start and end parameters can be blank in slice syntax.  Here, Python has default value for both the start and the end, as show below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; f[:]
'0 to 2147483647'
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the default value for the end of the slice shown here is simply the largest possible signed integer on a 32-bit system, and may vary depending on your system and C compiler.

*__setslice__ has the parameters (self,start,end,value)

We also have operators for deleting items and slices.
*__delitem__ has the parameters (self,index)
*__delslice__ has the parameters (self,start,end)
Note that these are the same as __getitem__ and __getslice__.

===Programming Practices===
The flexibility of python classes means that classes can adopt a varied set of behaviors.  For the sake of understandability, however, it's best to use many of Python's tools sparingly.  Try to declare all methods in the class definition, and always use the &lt;class&gt;.&lt;member&gt; syntax instead of __dict__ whenever possible.  Look at classes in [[C++ Programming/Classes|C++]] and [[w:Class (computer science)#Java|Java]] to see what most programmers will expect from a class.

====Encapsulation====
Since all python members of a python class are accessible by functions/methods outside the class, there is no way to enforce [[w:Information Hiding|encapsulation]] short of overriding __getattr__, __setattr__ and __delattr__.  General practice, however, is for the creator of a class or module to simply trust that users will use only the intended interface and avoid limiting access to the workings of the module for the sake of users who do need to access it.  When using parts of a class or module other than the intended interface, keep in mind that the those parts may change in later versions of the module, and you may even cause errors or undefined behaviors in the module.since encapsulation is private.

====Doc Strings====
When defining a class, it is convention to document the class using a string literal at the start of the class definition.  This string will then be placed in the __doc__ attribute of the class definition.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Documented:
...     &quot;&quot;&quot;This is a docstring&quot;&quot;&quot;
...     def explode(self):
...         &quot;&quot;&quot;
...         This method is documented, too! The coder is really serious about
...         making this class usable by others who don't know the code as well
...         as he does.
...
...         &quot;&quot;&quot;
...         print &quot;boom&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Documented()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.__doc__
'This is a docstring'
&lt;/source&gt;

Docstrings are a very useful way to document your code. Even if you never write a single piece of separate documentation (and let's admit it, doing so is the lowest priority for many coders), including informative docstrings in your classes will go a long way toward making them usable.

Several tools exist for turning the docstrings in Python code into readable API documentation, ''e.g.'', [http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/using.html EpyDoc].

Don't just stop at documenting the class definition, either. Each method in the class should have its own docstring as well. Note that the docstring for the method ''explode'' in the example class ''Documented'' above has a fairly lengthy docstring that spans several lines. Its formatting is in accordance with the style suggestions of Python's creator, Guido van Rossum in [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8].

==== Adding methods at runtime ====

===== To a class =====

It is fairly easy to add methods to a class at runtime. Lets assume that we have a class called ''Spam'' and a function cook. We want to be able to use the function cook on all instances of the class Spam:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Spam:
  def __init__(self):
    self.myeggs = 5

def cook(self):
  print &quot;cooking %s eggs&quot; % self.myeggs

Spam.cook = cook   #add the function to the class Spam
eggs = Spam()      #NOW create a new instance of Spam
eggs.cook()        #and we are ready to cook!
&lt;/source&gt;
This will output
 cooking 5 eggs

===== To an instance of a class =====

It is a bit more tricky to add methods to an instance of a class that has already been created. Lets assume again that we have a class called ''Spam'' and we have already created eggs. But then we notice that we wanted to cook those eggs, but we do not want to create a new instance but rather use the already created one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Spam:
  def __init__(self):
    self.myeggs = 5

eggs = Spam()

def cook(self):
  print &quot;cooking %s eggs&quot; % self.myeggs

import types
f = types.MethodType(cook, eggs, Spam)
eggs.cook = f

eggs.cook()
&lt;/source&gt;
Now we can cook our eggs and the last statement will output:
 cooking 5 eggs

===== Using a function =====

We can also write a function that will make the process of adding methods to an instance of a class easier.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def attach_method(fxn, instance, myclass):
  f = types.MethodType(fxn, instance, myclass)
  setattr(instance, fxn.__name__, f)
&lt;/source&gt;

All we now need to do is call the attach_method with the arguments of the function we want to attach, the instance we want to attach it to and the class the instance is derived from. Thus our function call might look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
attach_method(cook, eggs, Spam)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that in the function add_method we cannot write &lt;tt&gt;instance.fxn = f&lt;/tt&gt; since this would add a function called fxn to the instance.

'''Ducks''' have many domestic uses, being farmed for their meat, [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s, and feathers and down.  In many areas, ducks of various species are hunted for sport and food.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
==Types of domestic duck==
* ''Broiler Duckling'' or ''Fryer Duckling'' - a young duck (usually under 8 weeks of age) of either sex that is tender meated and has a soft bill; ducklings classified as broiler-fryers weigh from 3 to 6½ pounds.
* ''Roaster Duckling'' - a young duck (usually under 16 weeks of age) of either sex that is tender-meated and has a bill that is not completely hardened; they usually weigh from 4 to 7½ pounds.
* ''Mature Duck'' or ''Old Duck'' - a duck (usually over 6 months of age) of either sex with toughened flesh and a hardened bill; these ducks are usually too old to lay eggs and their meat is used in processed products.

==Raising==
Almost all ducks are raised indoors to protect from predators and to manage their manure, which is collected and used elsewhere selectively as fertilizer. In the United States, most ducks are now raised in Wisconsin and Indiana since land on Long Island, N.Y., where most ducks were formerly raised, has become increasingly too valuable for farming. Ducks are fed [[Cookbook:Maize|corn]] and [[Cookbook:Soybean|soybean]]s fortified with vitamins and minerals. Most feed contains no animal by-products.

No hormones are allowed in U.S. duck or goose production. The Food and Drug Administration strictly prohibits the use of hormones in these birds. Very few drugs have been approved for ducks so antibiotics are not routinely given and are not useful for feed efficiency. If a drug is given -- usually, through the feed -- to cure illness, for example, a &quot;withdrawal&quot; period of days is required from the time it is administered until it is legal to slaughter the bird. This is so residues can exit the bird's system.

==Duck meat==

Ducks swim, and they have a fat layer beneath the skin that keeps them buoyant and acts as heat insulation in cold water. Before cooking a whole duck, the skin should be pricked all over with a fork to help the fat to render out. This fat layer must have melted and disappeared for the bird to be done.

The fat is not &quot;marbled&quot; into the meat, so it can easily be removed from the surface of a raw duck if deboning the meat before cooking.

===Retail Cuts of Duck===

* Whole duckling including giblets and neck.
* Bone-in parts such as whole leg, breast quarter and breast.
* Boneless breast, skin-on or skinless.
* Giblets (liver, heart and gizzard) sold with whole birds, but much liver is sold separately, exp. in France.
* Tongues and Feet are considered a delicacy in [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asian cuisines]], especially [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]].
* Processed products such as smoked cooked breast, sausage, and hot dogs.

===Quantity to Buy===

When buying whole duck, allow about 1 to 1½ pounds of raw weight per person. Raw boneless meat yields about 3 servings per pound after cooking. Estimate 3 to 4-ounces per person for fully cooked products.

===Is Duck &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;White&quot; Meat?===

The definition for &quot;Red&quot; meat and &quot;White&quot; meat varies from place to place. Ducks are generally considered to be &quot;Red&quot; meat from  nutritional standpoint due to its higher ''myoglobin'' content. From a culinary standpoint however, ducks are considered to be &quot;White&quot; meat.

The higher myogloin content allows the muscles of the duck to absorb oxygen more effectively, which makes it possible for ducks to sustain long distance flights. Consider chickens which rely heavily on their thigh muscles &amp;ndash; this is why the drumstick meat of a chicken always looks darker than its breast meat.

==Safety==
===Food Borne Organisms===
As on any perishable meat, fish or poultry, bacteria can be found on raw or undercooked duck. Bacteria multiply rapidly at temperatures between 40° and 140° F (out of refrigeration and before thorough cooking occurs). Freezing doesn't kill bacteria but they are destroyed by thorough cooking of any food to 160° F.

''Salmonella'' is often associated with shell eggs and poultry. It may be found in the intestinal tracts of livestock, poultry, dogs, cats and other warm-blooded animals. This strain is only one of about 2,000 Salmonella bacteria. Freezing doesn't kill this microorganism but it is destroyed with thorough cooking of any food to 160° F.

Salmonella must be eaten to cause illness. Raw poultry must be handled carefully to prevent cross contamination. This can occur if raw duck or juices contact cooked food or foods that will be eaten raw such as salad. Salmonellosis is a food borne illness characterized by stomach pain, diarrhea and nausea.

===Safe Cooking===
The USDA recommends cooking whole poultry to 180 °F (82° C) as measured in the thigh using a food thermometer. When cooking pieces, the breast should reach 170 °F (76° C) internally. Drumsticks, thighs, and wings should be cooked until they reach an internal temperature of 180 °F (82° C)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider the vectors '''U''' and '''V ''' (with respective magnitudes |'''U'''| and |'''V'''|). If those vectors enclose an angle &amp;theta; then the dot product of those vectors can be written as:


:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\cdot\mathbf{V} = |\mathbf{U}||\mathbf{V}| \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

If the vectors can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = (U_x, U_y, U_z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V} = (V_x, V_y, V_z)&lt;/math&gt;

then the ''dot product'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\cdot\mathbf{V} = U_x V_x + U_y V_y + U_z V_z&lt;/math&gt;

For example,

:&lt;math&gt;(1, 2, 3) \cdot (2, 2, 2) = 1 (2) + 2 (2) + 3 (2) = 12.&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(0, 5, 0) \cdot (4, 0, 0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

We can interpret the last case by noting that the product is zero because the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees.

Since

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{U}| = \sqrt{U_x^2+U_y^2+U_z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{V}| = \sqrt{V_x^2+V_y^2+V_z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

this means that 

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = \frac{U_x V_x + U_y V_y + U_z V_z}{{\sqrt{U_x^2+U_y^2+U_z^2}}{\sqrt{V_x^2+V_y^2+V_z^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Those who own books v. those who hate books==
The main conflict in Fahrenheit 451 occurs between those who [[en:property|own]] [[en:book|book]]s and those who hate books.  Most of the individuals who despise books chose to hate the books themselves because society suggested them to, the government had nothing to do with the banning of ew. They are afraid of ews, in Bradbury's view, only because of the strong influence of a minority of people who find the content of ews offensive. This is first discernable when Montag steals an ew from one of the houses that his fireteam burned. When Mildred finds the ew, she becomes very argumentative and tells Montag to destroy it. Even the fact that there is a need for firemen to burn the [[en:house|house]]s of individuals who own ews makes this conflict apparent. It is, of course, not simply the ews themselves that frighten and offend, but rather the fact that ewing may lead to free thinking and free expression that threatens the government and entertainment based culture portrayed in the book. Some individuals such as Granger and Montag (at the end of the book) are forced to live on the [[en:railroad|railroad]] tracks in shantytowns away from the vast majority- where they become, ironically, a new minority themselves!

==Montag vs. Mildred==
It is clear from the beginning of the book that Guy's and Mildred's [[en:relationship|relationship]] is very troubled. Most of the conversations that occur between Guy and Mildred are, in fact, heated [[en:argument|argument]]s. Guy frequently wonders why he [[en:marriage|married]] Mildred and neither can remember how they met. At one point Montag cries because he realizes that her death would not really affect him. Bradbury has perhaps rightly been criticized for his portrayal of women as symbolized by the character of Mildred. Besides, this relationship also represents the lack of love among society. Their personalities clash. Ex. She loves all of the new technology, like many televsions and Guy is the total opposite.  Being a fireman has made him wonder and question why books are such a bad thing to have in society.  As his interest in books grow the more distant and questionable their relationship becomes.  She winds up ringing the alarm on her husband because of all of the illegal books that he has hidden. She jumps into a cab and speeds off as Guy and the rest of the fireman pull up to burn their (which is now only his house). by Garen

==The War=
The [[en:war|war]] is only briefly mentioned during most of the book. It seems distant and is only on the news for [[en:entertainment|entertainment]]. In the last segment of the book, however, the war suddenly becomes very real. It destroys the city that Montag had just fled. The war only lasts a few moments, but it leaves a devastating impact on many peoples Tsug plus ew equals sick. By Joana Contrerasbla

==Electric Field: E==

A stationary charge has an electric field surrounding it given by:

&lt;math&gt;E A = Q/\epsilon_o&lt;/math&gt;

A is 4 &amp;pi; r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; the surface area of a sphere&lt;br&gt;
Q/&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is how much the electric field deforms space

This becomes:

&lt;math&gt;E = {Q \over 4 \pi r^2 \epsilon_o}&lt;/math&gt;

==Permittivity: &amp;epsilon==

* '''Permittivity:''' (&amp;epsilon) How much energy a material absorbs when subject to an electric field. Similar to stretching a spring, when the electric field is removed, the material gives up the energy it has absorbed. 

* '''Vacuum Permittivity:''' The permittivity of the vacuum. &amp;epsilon&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.85419 10-12 F/m.

* '''Relative Permittivity:''' The permittivity of materials relative to the vacuum. Also known as the '''Dielectric Constant:''' &amp;epsilon&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Where &amp;epsilon is the permittivity of the material.

: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{r} = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}} &lt;/math&gt;

* '''Dielectric:''' Usually an insulator. Acts to decrease the strength of the electric field.

* '''Dielectric Strength:''' The maximum electric field a dieletric can handle before the electric field frees its bound electrons, turning the material into a conductor. The field strength at which breakdown occurs in a given case is dependent on the respective geometries of the dielectric (insulator) and the electrodes with which the electric field is applied, as well as the rate of increase at which the electric field is applied. Voltage is usually less than this number, and breakdown occurs when this number is exceeded.

* '''Birefringence:''' double refraction. 

* '''Isotropic:''' behavior does not depend on direction. 

* '''Anisotropic:''' behavior depends on direction.

&lt;!--

means &quot;independent of direction&quot;. Isotropic radiation has the same intensity regardless of the direction of measurement, and an isotropic field exerts the same action regardless of how the test particle is oriented.

* When an electric field is applied, a current flows. The total current flowing in a real medium is in general made of two parts: a conduction current and a displacement one. The displacement current can be thought of as an elastic response which a material has to the applied electric field. As the electric field is increased, the displacement current is stored in the material, and when the electric field is decreased the material releases the displacement current. A perfect dielectric is a material that shows displacement current only, so it stores and returns electrical energy as if it were an ideal 'battery'.

The effect that an electric field has on space. deforms and displaces space and restoring force. &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.85419 10-12 F/m.

A dielectric is the material between two charges.  It impedes the flow of charge until a certain voltage threshold at which point charge starts flowing, which is called dielectric breakdown and WHICH IS BAD AND DESTROYS THE CAPACITOR. :-)

''When I first learned about capacitors I thought that this was the way capacitors were used.  They charge up to a strong enough voltage and then the dielectric breaks down and then they charge up again.  I thought this was the basis for timer circuits.  We need to be careful to separate dielectric breakdown from things that are '''supposed''' to happen in electronic circuits.''

In electromagnetism, permittivity ε is a measure of how much a medium changes to absorb energy when subject to an electric field. It is defined as the ratio D / E where D is the electric displacement by the medium and E is the electric field strength. The displacement D is usually given in units of coulombs per square metre (C/m2), while the electric field E is given as volts per metre (V/m).

In the common case of an isotropic medium, D and E are parallel and ε is a scalar, but in more general anisotropic media this is not the case and ε is a rank-2 tensor (causing birefringence).

Birefringence, or double refraction, is the division of a ray of light into two rays (the ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray) when it passes through certain types of material, such as calcite crystals, depending on the polarization of the light. This is explained by assigning two different refractive indices to the material for different polarizations. The birefringence is quantified by:

    Δn = ne - no 

where no is the refractive index for the ordinary ray and ne is the refractive index for the extraordinary ray.

More generally, an anisotropic dielectric material has a dielectric constant that is a rank-2 tensor (3 by 3 matrix). A birefringent material corresponds to the special cases of a real-symmetric dielectric tensor ε with eigenvalues of , , and along the three orthogonal principle axes of polarization. (Or, sometimes, only two axes are considered, corresponding to a single propagation direction.)

(In principle, birefringence could also arise in magnetic, not dielectric, materials, but substantial variations in magnetic permeability are rare at optical frequencies.)

See also: crystal optics | John Kerr.

The cellophane paper is a cheap birefringent material. 

Anisotropic (meaning non-isotropic) is usually used to describe a directionally dependent phenomenon.

For example, anisotropic radiation has different intensities in different directions, and an anisotropic field exerts different actions depending on how the test particle is oriented. Magnetic susceptibility or electrical conductivity, for example, can be anisotropic in certain materials, as is the cosmic microwave background radiation. Wood is an anisotropic material as its strength and expansion due to humidity are different in the longitudinal, radial, and tangential directions. See also anisotropic etch, and liquid crystal

This term is also used in the field of computer graphics. For example, an anisotropic surface will change in appearance as it is rotated about its normal, as is the case with velvet. Anisotropic scaling occurs when something is scaled by different amounts in different directions, for example, stretching a 64×64-pixel texture to cover a 12×34-pixel rectangle. 

When an electric field is applied, a current flows. The total current flowing in a real medium is in general made of two parts: a conduction current and a displacement one. The displacement current can be thought of as an elastic response which a material has to the applied electric field. As the electric field is increased, the displacement current is stored in the material, and when the electric field is decreased the material releases the displacement current. A perfect dielectric is a material that shows displacement current only, so it stores and returns electrical energy as if it were an ideal 'battery'.

The permittivity ε and magnetic permeability μ of a medium together determine the velocity of electromagnetic radiation through that medium.

In a vacuum, these are given by

where μ0 is the magnetic constant, or permeability of free space, equal to 4π × 10-7 N·A-2, and c is the speed of light, 299,792,458 m/s.

In case of lossy medium (i.e. when the conduction currents are not negligible) the total current density flowing is:

where , σ is the conductivity (responsible for conduction current) of the medium and εd is the relative permittivity (responsible for displacement current).

In this formalism the complex permittivity ε* is defined as:

For realistic materials, both the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity are more complicated functions of frequency ω; since this leads to dispersion of signals containing multiple frequencies, such materials are called dispersive. This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not respond instantaneously to an applied field—because the response must always be causal (come after the applied field), the dielectric function ε(ω) must have poles only for ω with positive imaginary parts, and ε(ω) therefore satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the dielectric constants can often be approximated as frequency-independent.

At a given frequency, the imaginary part of ε leads to absorption loss if it is negative (in the above sign convention for frequency) and gain if it is positive. (More generally, one looks at the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the anisotropic dielectric tensor.) 

''See also [[list of indices of refraction]].''

The '''refractive index''' of a particular material at a particular [[frequency]] is the factor by which [[electromagnetic radiation]] of that frequency is slowed down (relative to vacuum) when it travels inside the material.  For a non-magnetic material, the square of the refractive index is the ''dielectric constant'' &amp;epsilon; (sometimes multiplied by &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[permittivity]] of free space).

The speed of all electromagnetic radiation in vacuum is the same, approximately 3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; meters per second, and is denoted by [[speed of light|&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]]. 
So if ''v'' is the [[phase velocity]] of radiation of a specific frequency in a specific material, then the refractive index is given by 

:''n'' = ''c''/''v''.

This number is typically bigger than one: the denser the material, the more the light is slowed down. However, at certain frequencies (e.g. near [[absorption]] resonances, and for [[x-ray]]s), ''n'' will actually be smaller than one. This does not contradict the [[theory of relativity]], which holds that no information carrying signal can ever propagate faster than ''c'', because the [[phase velocity]] is not the same as the [[group velocity]] or the [[signal velocity]].

The phase velocity is defined as the rate at which the crests of the waveform propagate; that is, the rate at which the [[phase]] of the waveform is moving. The ''group velocity'' is the rate that the ''envelope'' of the waveform is propagating; that is, the rate of variation of the [[amplitude]] of the waveform. It is the group velocity that (almost always) represents the rate that information (and energy) may be transmitted by the wave, for example the velocity at which a pulse of light travels down an [[optical fibre]].

Sometimes, a &quot;group velocity refractive index&quot;, usually called the ''group index'' is defined:

:''n''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; / c ,

where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the group velocity. This value should not be confused with ''n'', which is always defined with respect to the phase velocity. 

At the microscale an electromagnetic wave is slowed in a material because the [[electric field]] creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom (primarily the [[electron]]s) proportional to the permittivity. This oscillation of charges itself causes the radiation of an electromagnetic wave that is slightly out-of-[[phase]] with the original. The sum of the two waves creates a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength than the original, leading to a slowing in the wave's travel.

Sometimes the refractive index is defined as a [[complex number]], with the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part of the number representing the [[absorption]] of the material. This is particularly useful when analysing the propagation of electromagnetic waves through metals.

If the refractive indices of two materials are known for a given frequency, then one can compute the angle by which radiation of that frequency will be [[refraction|refracted]] as it moves from the first into the second material  from [[Snell's law]].

The refractive index of a material varies with frequency (except in vacuum, where all frequencies travel at the same speed, ''c''). This effect, known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], lets a [[prism]] divide white light into its constituent spectral [[color]]s, explains [[rainbow]]s, and is the cause of [[chromatic aberration]] in [[Lens (optics)|lenses]].

The refractive index of certain media may be different depending on the [[polarization]] and direction of propagation of the light through the medium. This is known as [[birefringence]] or anisotropy and is described by the field of [[crystal optics]].  In the most general case, the dielectric constant is a rank-2 tensor (a 3 by 3 matrix), which cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principle axes.  In magneto-optic (gyro-magnetic) materials, the principle axes are complex (corresponding to elliptical polarizations), and the dielectric tensor is complex-[[Hermitian]] (for lossless media); such materials break time-reversal symmetry and are used e.g. to construct optical isolators.

The strong [[electric field]] of high intensity light (such as output of a [[laser]]) may cause a medium's refractive index to vary as the light passes through it, giving rise to [[nonlinear optics]]. If the index varies quadratically with the field (linearly with the intensity), it is called the [[optical Kerr effect]] and causes phenomena such as [[self-focusing]] and [[self phase modulation]].  If the index varies linearly with the field (which is only possible in materials that do not possess [[inversion symmetry]]), it is known as the [[Pockels effect]].

See also [[list of indices of refraction]].

In telecommunication, a dielectric waveguide is a waveguide that consists of a dielectric material surrounded by another dielectric material, such as air, glass, or plastic, with a lower refractive index.

An example of a dielectric waveguide is an optical fiber.

A metallic waveguide filled with a dielectric material is not a dielectric waveguide.

==Voltage: V==

The difference between two points in an electric field is the voltage V. 

&lt;math&gt;V = E \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Voltage is used in accelerators to accelerate charged particles to the speed of light. In Electronics voltage is the potential between two opposing charges given by: 

&lt;math&gt; V = {q_1 \over 4 \pi \epsilon_o r_1} + {q_2 \over 4 \pi \epsilon_o r_2} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &amp;epsilon&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the permittivity of the vacuum, q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the values of the two charges (in coulombs), and r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are their distances. Note how the Voltage falls off as 1/r. 

If the charges were similar it would not make any sense. But if the particles have opposite charges then the voltage connects the charges. Through voltage positive charges go to the negative end, and negative charges go to the positive end. 

Voltage causes charged particles to move according to the rules of repulsion and attraction, so electrons move from negative to positive. Two charged particles have a potential between them that relates to their separation distance. 

Charged particles separated by a distance have a voltage associated with them. If the particles have a similar charge the voltage is repulsive and does not mean much. 

==Work: W==

'''PE'''&lt;br&gt;
A charged particle in an electric field at distance r has an electrical potential energy U associated with it. 

&lt;math&gt;U = Q V&lt;/math&gt;

'''KE'''&lt;br&gt;
When a charged particle is place in an electric field at distance r it has a force on it. The direction of force depends on the two charges, but minimizes the PE.

&lt;math&gt;F = Q E&lt;/math&gt;

'''Acceleration'''&lt;br&gt;

When a charged particle moves due to the force of an electric field it does work. This work causes the particle to accelerate.

Work W is the change in U, or F applied at a distance.

&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta U = F \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Falling downhill is positive work for the electric field and climbing uphill is positive work for the charged particle. Similar charges repel so bringing them together is uphill. Opposite charges attract so moving them apart is uphill.

==Current: I==

So the voltage on a charged particle causes it to accelerate. This is known as current.

It is sometimes taught that current in electric circuits is composed of electrons, which flow from the negative terminal of the power source to the positive at the speed of light.  This is not (completely) true.

# Electricity is carried by charged particles.
#: This can mean ''any'' small particles that carry charge and are free to move.  In metals, electrons are free to move and the metal nuclei are not.  In salt water, however, electrons, negative ions, and positive ions are free to move, and do, when a voltage is applied (batteries and electrolytic capacitors are examples of electrical components that carry charge as ions).  In your own nerve cells, electricity is carried by moving ions, such as potassium and sodium.  In semiconductors, electricity is carried by electrons, but is often much more easily understood as movement of &quot;holes&quot;; the absence of an electron.  ''In some static electricity experiments, electricity can be carried by charged dust or small pieces of paper.''
# Electrons ''drift'' through conductors.
#* When you flip the light switch, the light comes on almost instantly.  This does not mean that the electrons themselves move that quickly.  In fact, they usually move much much slower.  A typical speed for electron drift in a DC electronic circuit is slower than molasses.  The electrons themselves ''are'' moving very quickly, but not in one direction.  They are constantly moving randomly from atom to atom, and only have a very gradual drift, or shift in average position over time.  The speed electrons drift actually depends on voltage, resistance of the conductor, shape of the conductor, material the conductor is made of, temperature, and other factors.
#* What is actually traveling quickly is ''electromagnetic waves''; the pushing of electrons by their neighbors.  This is similar to the way a wave in water works.  When you drop a stone in a pond, a wave spreads out from where the stone hit the surface.  But does the water itself move?  Not really.  The water molecules at the surface are just moving back and forth, and their cumulative effect is the wave that you see, which travels in one direction.  This is similar to the travel of an AC wave down a transmission line.  (''we could make a better analogy to waves of car traffic or waves of people in line for a ride at the fair'')  An interesting analogy would be moving a hand through air.  The hand is the wave and the air is the random electron movement. 
# Electromagnetic waves only travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.
#* What is usually meant when someone says &quot;the speed of light&quot; is actually &quot;the speed of light in a vacuum&quot;, as light itself slows down while traveling through materials.  A typical speed for a signal traveling down common coaxial cable is 2/3 the speed of light (in a vacuum).  (This is about 200,000,000 m/s.)  The wave traveling down the cable is actually the same thing as light, just at a different frequency.  The waves traveling through your nerves as you read this are traveling at about 120 m/s.

As you increase voltage you increase the electric field and the speed at which charged particles travel. This is why increasing voltage directly increases current. Reversing the voltage reverses the current.  

Sometimes you have voltage but no current. This is used in analog and digital circuits to control switches.

So, negative particles drift from negative to positive voltage, and positive particles drift in the opposite direction from positive to negative voltage.  The particles drift at different speeds in different materials.  speed of &quot;holes&quot; based on bandgap.  Given the presence of holes we tend to ignore the particles and focus on the current flow.  Current is measured by the amount of charge flow per unit time and represents the speed of the electromagnetics waves.  In talking about current we will mainly talk about electrons flowing, as they are the predominant charge carriers in metal and many circuit components.

Current = flow of charge (usually electrons

Current is the change in charge over time.

&lt;math&gt;I={dQ \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Accumulation of current is charge. Talk about cells and capacitors.

&lt;math&gt;Q=\int I dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistance: R==

Resistance opposes the flow of electrons.  In the absence of resistance current shorts and flows unhindered like that of a power surge.  Resistance combined with voltage set limits on the current that is allowed to flow through electronics.  This is necessary otherwise the parts would melt (extreme electromigration).  As resistance increases the flow of charge slows to a trickle until current stops flowing.  Given the sheer number of electrons flowing this does not happen until resistance is effectively infinite.  

Without resistance this is effectively a short meaning the electrons flow unhindered.
 The current is limited by the voltage. Resistance stops the flow of current. A '''short circuit''' has no resistance. As resistance increases to infinity the current stops flowing and becomes an '''open circuit'''.

&lt;math&gt;I = {V \over R}&lt;/math&gt; 

This is known as '''Ohm's law'''. Which says that Current ''I'' is equal to Voltage ''V'' divided by Resistance ''R''. Or that voltage creates current and resistance limits the flow of current. In a circuit resistance does not change much, so most of the behavior of a circuit depends on the voltage which controls the current.

Current through a conductor versus an insulator like air.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is found in batteries.  (''a battery could also be considered a current source, depending on perspective.  i think we should not include batteries yet and only focus on what &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;current&quot; mean.  then we can move on to ideal voltage and current sources, and then real sources.'')  

(''Is there a difference between series and parallel voltage assuming there are no current splits?  Depends if you mean ideal voltage sources or things like batteries.  Ideal voltage sources can't be placed in parallel.  This would be the same thing as saying 5=3.  Real voltage sources have some internal resistance, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which would load the other battery's ideal voltage source.'')

:''Is there a difference between ideal and real sources besides a resistor?''

::''Nope.  An impedance, actually.  But basically the same thing.  It's a hugely important difference, though.  *Very* important for beginners to understand.''

:I don't get it. You mean the maximum current a power source can output? How else does internal resistance affect the output of a power supply?

:: Impedance contains information about capacitance and inductance, in addition to resistance.  Power supplies and cells (a battery is a stack of cells) can be quite different.  Even mere resistance will affect the battery's temperature, which will in turn affect the resistance.  Additionally, batteries are chemical devices and are impacted by the chemical processes that take place inside.  As a result, the voltage characteristics of batteries evolve during their lifetimes.  Also as a result, different types of batteries recharge differently.  A nominal 9V battery will not actually produce 9V during the entirety of its life.  Real batteries are quite complex.  We simplify thinking about them because most of that stuff seldom matters.  If you wanted to build a battery operated robot that would sit idle for months at a time and do something useful when its battery was going dead, then many of these things would begin to matter. --[[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 22:41, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::Likewise, with other real voltage sources, like the output of an op-amp, it is important to realize that it has an output impedance, which cannot be separated from the ideal voltage source.  The impedance has effects on op-amp stability, power handling, maximum current/voltage, loading, etc.  We model real voltage sources as an ideal voltage source (which just creates a voltage between two conductors, regardless of anything else) with an impedance permanently attached.  A real battery has inductance, capacitance, and predominantly resistance right at the output of a perfect voltage source, meaning the battery will give different voltages depending on what it is loaded with, etc.  We should mention in the article that a short circuit across an ideal voltage source would produce infinite current and vice versa. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]</text>

==Introduction==

Throughout the previous chapters you have learned the basic concepts of XSL and how you must refer to nodes in an XML document when performing an XSL transformation. Up to this point you have been using a straightforward syntax for referring to nodes in an XML document. Although the syntax you have used so far has been XPath there are many more functions and capabilities that you will learn in this chapter. As you begin to comprehend how path language is used for referring to nodes in an XML document your understanding of XML as a tree structure will begin to fall into place. This chapter contains examples that demonstrate many of the common uses of XPath, but for the full XPath specification, see the latest version of the standard at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath

XSL uses XPath heavily.

==[[XPath]]==

When you go to copy a file or ‘cd’ into a directory at a command prompt you often type something along the lines of ‘/home/darnell/’ to refer to folders. This enables you to change into or refer to folders throughout your computer’s file system. XML has a similar way of referring to elements in an XML document. This special syntax is called XPath, which is short for XML Path Language.

XPath is a language for finding information in an XML document. XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.

XPath, although used for referring to nodes in an XML tree, is not itself written in XML. This was a wise choice on the part of the W3C, because trying to specify path information in XML would be a very cumbersome task. Any characters that form XML syntax would need to be escaped so that it is not confused with XML when being processed. XPath is also very succinct, allowing you to call upon nodes in the XML tree with a great degree of specificity without being unnecessarily verbose.

==XML as a tree structure== 

The great benefit about XML is that the document itself describes the structure of data. If any of you have researched your family history, you have probably come across a family tree. At the top of the tree is some early ancestor and at the bottom of the tree are the latest children.

With a tree structure you can see which children belong to which parents, which grandchildren belong to which grandparents and many other relationships.

The neat thing about XML is that it also fits nicely into this tree structure, often referred to as an XML Tree.

==Understanding node relationships==

We will use the following example to demonstrate the different node relationships.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;bookstore&gt;
	&lt;book&gt; 
		&lt;title&gt;Less Than Zero&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;author&gt;Bret Easton Ellis&lt;/author&gt;
		&lt;year&gt;1985&lt;/year&gt;
		&lt;price&gt;13.95&lt;/price&gt;
	&lt;/book&gt; 
&lt;/bookstore&gt;
&lt;/source&gt; 

;Parent
:Each element and attribute has one parent.
:The book element is the parent of the title, author, year, and price:

;Children
:Element nodes may have zero, one or more children.
:The title, author, year, and price elements are all children of the book element:

;Siblings
:Nodes that have the same parent.
:The title, author, year, and price elements are all siblings:

;Ancestors
:A node's parent, parent's parent, etc.
:The ancestors of the title element are the book element and the bookstore element:

;Descendants
:A node's children, children's children, etc.
:Descendants of the bookstore element are the book, title, author, year, and price elements:

Also, it is still useful in some ways to think of an XML file as simultaneously being a serialized file, like you would view it in an XML editor. This is so you can understand the concepts of preceding and following nodes. A node is said to '''precede''' another if the original node is before the other in document order. Likewise, a node '''follows''' another if it is after that node in document order. Ancestors and descendants are not considered to be either preceding or following a node. This concept will come in handy later when discussing the concept of an axis.

== Abbreviated vs. Unabbreviated XPath syntax ==

XPath was created so that nodes can be referred to very succinctly, while retaining the ability to search on many options. Most uses of XPath will involve searching for child nodes, parent nodes, or attribute nodes of a particular node. Because these uses are so common, an abbreviated syntax can be used to refer to these commonly-searched nodes. Following is an XML document that simulates a tree (the type that has leaves and branches.)  It will be used to demonstrate the different types of syntax.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
    &lt;trunk name=&quot;the_trunk&quot;&gt; 
        &lt;bigBranch name=&quot;bb1&quot; thickness=&quot;thick&quot;&gt; 
            &lt;smallBranch name=&quot;sb1&quot;&gt; 
                &lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf1&quot; color=&quot;brown&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf2&quot; weight=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf3&quot; /&gt; 
	    &lt;/smallBranch&gt; 
	    &lt;smallBranch name=&quot;sb2&quot;&gt;
                &lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf4&quot; weight=&quot;90&quot; /&gt; 
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf5&quot; color=&quot;purple&quot; /&gt;   
            &lt;/smallBranch&gt;
        &lt;/bigBranch&gt; 
        &lt;bigBranch name=&quot;bb2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;smallBranch name=&quot;sb3&quot;&gt; 
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf6&quot; /&gt; 
	    &lt;/smallBranch&gt; 
	    &lt;smallBranch name=&quot;sb4&quot;&gt;	
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf7&quot; /&gt; 
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf8&quot; /&gt; 
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf9&quot; color=&quot;black&quot; /&gt; 
		&lt;leaf name=&quot;leaf10&quot; weight=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;	 
            &lt;/smallBranch&gt;
        &lt;/bigBranch&gt; 
    &lt;/trunk&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 9.2: tree. xml – Example XML page&lt;/small&gt;

Following are a few examples of XPath location paths in English, Abbreviated XPath, then Unabbreviated XPath.


'''Selection 1:'''

'''English:'''  All &amp;lt;leaf&amp;gt; elements in this document that are children of &amp;lt;smallBranch&amp;gt; elements that are children of &amp;lt;bigBranch&amp;gt; elements, that are children of the trunk, which is a child of the root.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Abbreviated:'''   /trunk/bigBranch/smallBranch/leaf&lt;br /&gt;
'''Unabbreviated:''' /child::trunk/child::bigBranch/child::smallBranch/child::leaf

'''Selection 2:'''

'''English:'''	The &amp;lt;bigBranch&amp;gt; elements with ‘name’ attribute equal to ‘bb3,’ that are children of the trunk element, which is a child of the root.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Abbreviated:'''		/trunk/bigBranch[@name=’bb3’]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Unabbreviated:'''	/child::trunk/child::bigBranch[attribute::name=’bb3’]

Notice how we can specify which bigBranch objects we want by using a predicate in the previous example. This narrows the search down to only bigBranch nodes that satisfy the '''predicate'''. The predicate is the part of the XPath statement that is in square brackets. In this case, the predicate is asking for bigBranch nodes with their ‘name’ attribute set to ‘bb3’.

The last two examples assume we want to specify the path from the root. Let’s now assume that we are specifying the path from a &lt;smallBranch&gt; node.

'''Selection 3:'''

'''English:'''The parent node of the current &amp;lt;smallBranch&amp;gt;. (Notice that this selection is relative to a &amp;lt;smallBranch&amp;gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Abbreviated:'''   ..&lt;br /&gt;
'''Unabbreviated:''' parent::node()

When using the Unabbreviated Syntax, you may notice that you are calling a parent or child followed by two colons (::). Each of those are called an '''axis'''. You will learn more about axes shortly.

Also, this may be a good time to explain the concept of a '''location path'''. A location path is the series of location steps taken to reach the node/nodes being selected. '''Location steps''' are the parts of XPath statements separated by / characters. They are one step on the way to finding the nodes you would like to select. 

Location steps are comprised of three parts: an axis (child, parents, descendant, etc.), a node test (name of a node, or a function that retrieves one or more nodes), and a series of predicates (tests on the retrieved nodes that narrow the results, eliminating nodes that do not pass the predicate’s test). 

So, in a location path, each of its location steps returns a node-list. If there are further steps on the path after a location step, the next step is executed on all the nodes returned by that step.

==Relative vs. Absolute paths==

When specifying a path with XPath, there are times when you will already be ‘in’ a node. But other times, you will want to select nodes starting from the root node. XPath lets you do both. If you have ever worked with websites in HTML, it works the same way as referring to other files in HTML hyperlinks. In HTML, you can specify an '''Absolute Path''' for the hyperlink, describing where another page is with the server name, folders, and filename all in the URL. Or, if you are referring to another file on the same site, you need not enter the server name or all of the path information. This is called a '''Relative Path'''. The concept can be applied similarly in XPath. 

You can tell the difference by whether there is a ‘/’ character at the beginning of the XPath expression. If so, the path is being specified from the root, which makes it an Absolute Path. But if there is no ‘/’ at the beginning of the path, you are specifying a Relative Path, which describes where the other nodes are relative to the '''context node''', or the node for which the next step is being taken. 

Below is an XSL stylesheet (Exhibit 9.3) for use with our tree.xml file above (Exhibit 9.2). 

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
 &lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
                
&lt;!-- Example of an absolute link. The element '/child::trunk' 
 is being specified from the root element. --&gt;

 &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/child::trunk&quot;&gt; 

&lt;html&gt; 
    &lt;head&gt; 
        &lt;title&gt;XPath Tree Tests&lt;/title&gt; 
    &lt;/head&gt; 
     &lt;body&gt; 
    
&lt;!-- Example of a relative link. The &lt;for-each&gt; xsl statement will 
    execute for every &lt;bigBranch&gt; node in the 
    ‘current’ node, which is the &lt;trunk&gt;node. --&gt;

 &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;child::bigBranch&quot;&gt;
               
         &lt;xsl:call-template name=&quot;print_out&quot; /&gt;
           &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt; 
   &lt;/html&gt; 
&lt;/xsl:template&gt; 
      &lt;xsl:template name=&quot;print_out&quot;&gt; 
             &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;attribute::name&quot; /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;    
   &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Exhibit 9.3: xsl_tree.xsl – Example of both a relative and absolute path&lt;/small&gt;

== Four types of XPath location paths ==

In the last two sections you learned about two different distinctions to separate out different location paths: Unabbreviated vs. Abbreviated and Relative vs. Absolute. Combining these two concepts could be helpful when talking about XPath location paths. Not to mention, it could make you sound really smart in front of your friends when you say things like:
:#Abbreviated Relative Location Paths- Use of abbreviated syntax while specifying a relative path.
:#Abbreviated Absolute Location Paths- Use of abbreviated syntax while specifying a absolute path.
:#Unabbreviated Relative Location Paths- Use of unabbreviated syntax while specifying a relative path.
:#Unabbreviated Absolute Location Paths- Use of unabbreviated syntax while specifying a absolute path.

I only mention this four-way distinction now because it could come in handy while reading the specification, or other texts on the subject. 

== XPath axes ==

In XPath, there are some node selections whose performance requires the Unabbreviated Syntax. In this case, you will be using an axis to specify each location step on your way through the location path. 

From any node in the tree, there are 13 axes along which you can step. They are as follows:


{|
|-
! Axes
! Meaning
|-
| ancestor::
| Parents of the current node up to the root node
|-
| ancestor-or-self::
| Parents of the current node up to the root node and the current node
|-
| attribute::
| Attributes of the current node
|-
| child::
| Immediate children of the current node
|-
| descendant::
| Children of the current node (including children's children)
|-
| descendant-or-self::
| Children of the current node (including children's children) and the current node
|-
| following::
| Nodes after the current node (excluding children)
|-
| following-sibling::
| Nodes after the current node (excluding children) at the same level
|-
| namespace::
| [[XML namespace]] of the current node
|-
| parent::
| Immediate parent of the current node
|-
| preceding::
| Nodes before the current node (excluding children)
|-
| preceding-sibling::
| Nodes before the current node (excluding children) at the same level
|-
| self::
| The current node
|}

== XPath predicates and functions ==

Sometimes, you may want to use a predicate in an XPath Location Path to further filter your selection. Normally, you would get a set of nodes from a location path. A predicate is a small expression that gets evaluated for each node in a set of nodes. If the expression evaluates to ‘false’, then the node is not included in the selection. An example is as follows:

//p[@class=‘alert’]

In the preceding example, every &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag in the document is checked to see if its ‘class’ attribute is set to ‘alert’. Only those &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tags with a ‘class’ attribute with value ‘alert’ are included in the set of nodes for this location path. 

The following example uses a function, which can be used in a predicate to get information about the context node. 

/book/chapter[position()=3]

This previous example selects only the chapter of the book in the third position. So, for something to be returned, the current &amp;lt;book&amp;gt; element must have at least 3 &amp;lt;chapter&amp;gt; elements. 

Also notice that the position function returns an integer. There are many functions in the XPath specification. For a complete list, see the W3C specification at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#corelib

Here are a few more functions that may be helpful:

number '''last'''() – last node in the current node set

number '''position'''() – position of the context node being tested

number '''count'''(node-set) – the number of nodes in a node-set

boolean '''starts-with'''(string, string) – returns true if the first argument starts with the second

boolean '''contains'''(string, string) – returns true if the first argument contains the second

number '''sum'''(node-set) – the sum of the numeric values of the nodes in the node-set

number '''floor'''(number) – the number, rounded down to the nearest integer

number '''ceiling'''(number) – the number, rounded up to the nearest integer

number '''round'''(number) – the number, rounded to the nearest integer

== Example ==

The following XML document, XSD schemas, and XSL stylesheet examples are to help you put everything you have learned in this chapter together using real life data. As you study this example you will notice how XPath can be used in the stylesheet to call and modify the output of specific information from the document.

Below is an XML document (Exhibit 9.4)

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;movies.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;?&gt;
&lt;movieCollection xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=&quot;movies.xsd&quot;&gt; 

&lt;movie&gt;
    &lt;movieTitle&gt;Meet the Parents&lt;/movieTitle&gt;
    &lt;movieSynopsis&gt;
    Greg Focker is head over heels in love with his girlfriend Pam, and is ready to
    pop the big question. When his attempt to propose is thwarted by a phone call
    with the news that Pam's younger sister is getting married, Greg realizes that
    the key to Pam's hand in marriage lies with her formidable father.
    &lt;/movieSynopsis&gt;

        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;bs1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Lead Actor&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;tp1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Lead Actress&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;rd1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Lead Actor&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;bd1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Supporting Actress&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;      
&lt;/movie&gt;

&lt;movie&gt;
    &lt;movieTitle&gt;Elf&lt;/movieTitle&gt;
    &lt;movieSynopsis&gt;
    One Christmas Eve, a long time ago, a small baby at an orphanage crawled into
    Santa’s bag of toys, only to go undetected and accidentally carried back to Santa’s 
    workshop in the North Pole. Though he was quickly taken under the wing of a surrogate
    father and raised to be an elf, as he grows to be three sizes larger than everyone else, 
    it becomes clear that Buddy will never truly fit into the elf world. What he needs is
    to find his real family. This holiday season, Buddy decides to find his true place in the
    world and sets off for New York City to track down his roots.
    &lt;/movieSynopsis&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;wf1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Lead Actor&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;jc1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Supporting Actor&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;zd1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Lead Actress&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;
    &lt;role&gt;
        &lt;roleIDREF&gt;ms1&lt;/roleIDREF&gt;
        &lt;roleType&gt;Supporting Actress&lt;/roleType&gt;
    &lt;/role&gt;      
    &lt;/movie&gt;

| Throughout the chapter we have learned many of the features and capabilities of the XML Path Language. You should now have a good understanding of node relationships though the use of the XML tree structure. Using the concept of Abbreviated and Unabbreviated location paths allows us to narrow our searches down to only a particular element by satisfying the predicate in the square brackets. Relative and Absolute are used for specifying the path to your location. The Relative path gives the file location in relation to the current working directory while the Absolute path gives an exact location of a file or directory name within a computer or file system. Both of these concepts can be combined to come up with four types of XPath location paths: Abbreviated Relative, Abbreviated Absolute, Unabbreviated Relative, and lastly Unabbreviated Absolute. If further filtering is required XPath predicates and functions can be used. These allow for the predicate to be evaluated for such things as true/false and count functions. When used correctly XPath can be a very powerful tool in the XML language.

Ok, &quot;van-halen&quot; style tapping as you call it is not two handed tapping, thats just plain tapping.  Although i have not checked out his work, i assume that jordan guy is someone who uses two-handed tapping, also known as touch style.  There are quite a few people around who use that style, as for virtuosity, besides being a matter of opinion, there are many very skilled two-handed tapping players such as Adam Fulara. Also your missing out Joe Satriani who is probably the most widely known artist to take advantage of two handed tapping.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{General Mechanics}}

==Torque==

Torque is the action of a force  on a mass  which induces it to revolve about some point, called the origin. It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is the position of the mass relative to the origin.

Notice that the torque is zero in a number of circumstances. If the force points directly toward or away from the origin, the cross product is zero, resulting in zero torque, even though the force is non-zero. Likewise, if '''r'''=0, the torque is zero. Thus, a force acting at the origin produces no torque. Both of these limits make sense intuitively, since neither induces the mass to revolve around the origin.

==Angular momentum==

The angular momentum of a mass relative to a point O is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where p is the ordinary (also called &quot;linear&quot;) momentum of the mass. The angular momentum is zero if the motion of the object is directly towards or away from the origin, or if it is located at the origin.

If we take the cross product of the position vector and Newton's second law, we obtain an equation that relates torque and angular momentum:
	
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{r}\times \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}
=\frac{d}{dt}\left( \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p} \right)-\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}\times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the cross product of parallel vectors is zero, this simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau}=\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the rotational version of Newton's second law.

For both torque and angular momentum the location of the origin is arbitrary, and is generally chosen for maximum convenience. However, it is necessary to choose the same origin for both the torque and the angular momentum.

For the case of a central force, i. e., one which acts along the line of centers between two objects (such as gravity), there often exists a particularly convenient choice of origin.  If the origin is placed at the center of the sun (which is assumed not to move under the influence of the planet's gravity), then the torque exerted on the planet by the sun's gravity is zero, which means that the angular momentum of the planet about the center of the sun is constant in time. No other choice of origin would yield this convenient result.

We already know about two fundamental conservation laws -- those of energy and linear momentum. We believe that angular momentum is similarly conserved in isolated systems. In other words, particles can exchange angular momentum between themselves, but the vector sum of the angular momentum of all the particles in a system isolated from outside influences must remain constant.

&lt;!-- Needs diagram
Figure 10.4: Scenario for the non-conservation of angular momentum.

Conservation of angular momentum is not an automatic consequence of the conservation of linear momentum, even though the governing equation (10.8) for angular momentum is derived from Newton's second law. As an example, figure 10.4 shows a hypothetical situation in which the force of on is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the force of on , i. e., Newton's third law holds, and the sum of the momenta of the two masses is conserved. However, because the forces are non-central, the masses revolve more and more rapidly with time about the origin, and angular momentum is not conserved. This scenario is impossible if angular momentum is conserved. --&gt;

In the modern view, conservation of angular momentum is a consequence of the isotropy of space -- i. e., the properties of space don't depend on direction. This is in direct analogy with conservation of ordinary momentum, which we recall is a consequence of the homogeneity of space.

==Angular velocity and centrifugal force==

If an object is rotating about an axis, '''n''', '''n''' being a unit vector, at frequency &amp;omega; we say it has angular velocity '''&amp;omega;'''. Despite the name, this is ''not'' the rate of change of a angle, nor even of a vector.

If a constant vector '''r''' is rotating with angular velocity '''&amp;omega;''' about a fixed point then
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{r}}=\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

This says the acceleration is always at right angles to both the velocity and the axis of rotation.

When the axis is changing '''&amp;omega;''' can be defined as the vector which makes this true.

Note that on the left hand side of this equation '''r'''  is a vector in a fixed coordinate system with variable components but on the right hand side its components are given in a moving coordinate system, where they are fixed.

We can distinguish them more clearly by using subscripts, 'r' for rotating and 'f' for fixed, then extend this to arbitrary vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{g}}_f=\dot{\mathbf{g}}_r+
\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{g}_f&lt;/math&gt;

for ''any'' vector, '''g'''.

Using this, we can write Newton's second law in the rotating frame.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \mathbf{F}_f &amp; = &amp; m \dot{\mathbf{v}}_f &amp; &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; m\dot{\mathbf{v}}_r &amp;+&amp;m \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}_f\\
&amp; = &amp; m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_r &amp;+&amp;m \boldsymbol{\omega} \times (2\dot{\mathbf{r}}_r+
\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}_f)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, rearranging

:&lt;math&gt;m\mathbf{a}_r=\mathbf{F}-2m(\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}_r)
-m\boldsymbol{\omega} \times(\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

The mass behaves as if there were two additional forces acting on it. The first term, '''&amp;omega;'''&amp;times;'''v''' is called the ''Coriolis'' force. The second term is recognizable as the familiar centrifugal force.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Panel''' is an area, often along the edge of the screen, which can contain program launchers, menus, the window list and notification area, and other [[../Applets|applets]].

GNOME by default has two panels on the desktop, one up the top of the screen and one down the bottom. The top panel contains some menus to the left, for Applications, Actions and Places, a notification area to the right, and a clock to the left of the notification area. The bottom panel contains a button on the left which hides all visible windows, displaying the desktop, a window list to the right of that, which contains buttons for all windows open on the desktop, and to the right of the panel a desktop pager.

== Customizing Panels ==

Panels can be customized in a number of ways. It is possible to change their appearance slightly, to change their contents, and to change their position, size and behaviour.

=== Contents of Panels ===

The contents of panels are all applets, which can be added, moved and removed on the panel.

To move applets on the panel, right-clicking the applet in the appropriate area will open a context menu which contains options such as to ''Lock to Panel'', ''Move'' and ''Remove from Panel''. To move the applet, select Move and the applet will follow your mouse as you move it along the panel, changing its position. You will notice when moving applets around, the applet will flip to other sides of other applets, or move those applets out of the way if necessary. By right-clicking an applet and selecting ''Lock to Panel'', the applet will not move around for other applets, and will be locked in position on the panel. If you are unable to move an applet on the panel, it might be because it is locked to the panel. Clicking the option from the context menu will deselect this option, allowing you to move the applet. Also note that you must sometimes click on the appropriate spot on the applet. For instance, right-clicking on an entry in the window list will open a context menu related to the window represented by the button (i.e. ''Close'', ''Maximize'', etc.). In the case of the window list, notification area, and some other applets, the right place to click is a small area to one side of the applet.

The ''Remove from Panel'' option under the context menu for applets will remove the applet in question from the panel completely. It can be returned at any time. Sometimes however, preferences related to the applet can be lost when removing them from the panel.

To add an applet to the panel, right-click on an empty space on the panel. Empty space might be hard to find sometimes i.e. the window list, when empty, looks like empty space, but is not, so watch out for this, and move / resize / remove applets if they get in your way. The context menu that appear will provide you with an option to ''Add to Panel''. Selecting this will open a dialog which lists many applets that you can add, and their descriptions. They will be placed on the panel roughly where you right-clicked to open the context menu, and you can move them around and change them at will.

Sometimes when clicking on applets special options appear that are specific to that applet. These can provide options and preferences for that applet that you can change, for example, on their behaviour and appearance. You can experiment with some applets to see how you can customize them.

=== Appearance and Behaviour of Panels ===

The appearance of panels can be changed in ways by right-clicking on an empty space on the panel to open a context menu, and selecting ''Properties''. Under the ''Background'' tab, it is possible to change the background colour of the panel, to provide a background image which will be repeated across the panel, or to change the transparency of the panel.

The size and position of panels can be changed by opening the ''Properties'' dialog, and looking under the ''General'' tab. ''Orientation'' changes which edge of the screen the panel sits on. It is possible for it to sit horizontally on the top or bottom of the screen, or for it to sit vertically on the left or right. It is possible to change the height or width (depending on the orientation of the panel) of the panel by changing the ''Size'' option. Selecting or unselecting ''Expand'' will determine whether the panel expands to fill an entire side of the screen or whether it is only as big as its contents. ''Autohide'' will hide the panel, and make it reappear when your mouse hovers over the appropriate edge of the screen. ''Show hide buttons'' determines whether there are ''hide'' buttons on the panel, which you can click to make the panel appear or disappear.

It is possible to change the side of the screen a panel is on by clicking on an empty space on the panel and dragging it. When the ''Expand'' option for the panel is not set, it is possible for the panel to occupy parts of the screen other than the edges.

=== Adding or Removing Panels ===

It is possible to add a new panel by right-clicking on an empty space on an existing panel to open the context menu and selecting ''New Panel''. This will create a new panel on another side of the screen, which you can change around however you want. You can delete an existing panel by selecting ''Delete this Panel'' from the context menu.

=== Customising Panels from the command line ===

Wed, 11 Dec. 2002 -- Media Matters No. 20:
A word is a word is a word -- or is it? 

Today's Media Matters begins a look at the words we use to talk about our research when we work to disseminate it beyond our own research colleagues. 

Scientists, researchers and professionals all have sets of words they use routinely. The words seem clear enough, we think. Some terms are specific to one's particular profession. Others are terms that are common to the scientific community. Scientists and researchers use words in very precise ways, to mean one thing only -- and not another. 

The problem with these words is that, while they communicate specific concepts clearly to colleagues, they often are thought of as jargon by outsiders. 

When our goal is to reach the public with information about our research findings, the use of such words often erects an unnecessary barrier. 

Journalism professor Carl Sessions Stepp of the University of Maryland gives a simple explanation by talking about what he calls &quot;banana words.&quot; 

Think of words such as &quot;prison,&quot; &quot;sidewalk,&quot; or &quot;shark,&quot; he says. These are sometimes called &quot;banana words&quot; because, like the word &quot;banana,&quot; they conjure up specific, shared images for most of us. 

By contrast, consider words such as &quot;proposal,&quot; &quot;facility&quot; and &quot;problem.&quot; These are sometimes called &quot;fuzz words,&quot; &quot;blob words,&quot; or &quot;second-degree words,&quot; he says, because they convey only abstractions. Although certain scientific terms are meaningful and clear to researchers, they fall into this category when they are used in press releases meant for editors and reporters in general-interest media. 

Readers can understand banana words standing alone, but fuzz words require other words before making sense. 

Although to a researcher a &quot;banana word&quot; may seem to denote fuzzy thinking, in fact it communicates more clearly to people who need only a general understanding of your research, whereas a word that may seem to you more specific in fact seems to be only a &quot;blob word&quot; to reporters and editors. 

Especially in the first few sentences of a press release, says Stepp, one should strive for the highest possible percentage of banana words and images.

A Word is a Word is a Word unless It's from Another Language 

What do the following have in common?

The skunk someone hit on the GA 316... 
The video you wanted to rent... 
The Grand Canyon you visited last summer... 
The junk you keep putting in your closet... 
The soybeans doctors say are good for you... 
The alarm clock that didn't go off this morning... 
The English paper you haven't written... 
The tomato, potato and apricot, some of us eat regularly... 
The salt and pepper that add spice to many dishes... 
The gadgets you can't live without... 
The pumpkin pie of the traditional Thanksgiving feast... 

Are you stumped? Here's a clue: look at the list again, but this time, look only and very carefully at the first noun(s). 

The skunk someone hit on the GA 316... 
The video you wanted to rent... 
The Grand Canyon you visited last summer... 
The junk you keep putting in your closet... 
The soybeans doctors say are good for you... 
The alarm clock that didn't go off this morning 
The English paper you haven't written... 
The tomato, potato,and apricot some of us eat regularly... 
The salt and pepper that add spice to many dishes... 
The gadgets you can't live without... 
The pumpkin pie of the traditional Thanksgiving feast... 
Fourteen words...all perfectly understandable to speakers of American English, and yet, they have something very un-American in common. If you guessed that these words derive from other languages, you're right. These fourteen words come from over a dozen foreign languages; they, and thousands of other words, have been seamlessly incorporated into American English. 

But, American English doesn't just &quot;take &quot; from other languages; it also &quot;gives&quot; many words and expressions to other languages. The difference between a &quot;living&quot; and a &quot;dead&quot; language is like the difference between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee: everything flows into the Dead Sea; nothing flows out. 

skunk...&quot;he who squirts&quot;
If you've hit one on the road or met one face to face, nobody needs to tell you this little, striped mammal can squirt his foul, yellow spray up to a dozen feet. Perhaps, the Algonquian Indians, finding themselves once too often at the other end of the yellow spray, invented the word from which the word &quot;skunk&quot; is derived; in the Algonquian dialect, it simply means &quot;he who squirts.&quot;

video...&quot;I see&quot;
Video, from the Latin &quot;I see,&quot; has been applied to television since the 1950's.

Canyon...&quot;a large tube or funnel&quot;
If you've been to the Grand Canyon--perhaps, the most famous canyon in the world--canyon as a large tube or funnel hardly seems adequate to contain the meaning of what you experience standing on its North Rim and looking across the magnificent expanse before you. Derived from the Spanish, canyon in the U.S. is used to mean a very deep valley or gorge with steep sides, often with water flowing at the bottom. Even this definition falls short. Standing on the rim of the Grand Canyon, you know--among other things--what it means to run out of words before you run out of thoughts.

Junk...&quot;untidy, small sailing boat&quot;
In the 18th century, pronunciation of foreign words was as much of a problem as it is today. Then, British sailors pronounced the Portuguese-via-Japanese word for small, sailing vessel, djong, as junk. Because the &quot;junks&quot; looked messy and untidy, &quot;junk&quot;--it is conjectured--has come to mean messy stuff.

Soybean....&quot;salted food + oil&quot;
The ancient Chinese originally made a sauce from this bean, and it is believed, named the bean after the sauce. It is conjectured--things and words in the ancient world tended to travel without leaving a paper trail--that when the bean, perhaps in sauce or without, arrived in Japan, they called it shoy. From the Japanese word came the English soy, to which was added bean, and hence soybean. It is said that the Japanese valued soy sauce so highly, it was used as part of the salary of imperial court officers in fifth century Japan.

alarm...&quot;a warning&quot;
There have probably always been various words used as containers for transmitting the meaning of danger or warning or enemy coming. It is curious why a certain word from a specific language becomes the word from which American English derives a word to contain, in this case, the meaning of warning. In the case of alarm, it is the Italian word all' arme! from which we derive alarm. In many instances, when words are derived from &quot;foreign&quot; words, letters drop and vanish, perhaps, in the interests of simplification.

English...10 million words
As a designation for a language, English is first recorded in about A.D. 1000. At that time, there were about 30,000 words in the English language. Today's dictionaries contain about 650,000 words, but if all scientific and technical terms were included, the number of words in the English language swells to more than 10 million words. The average English speaker has a vocabulary of about 3,000 words, whereas an educated or well-read person might have a vocabulary of 60,000 words. Shakespeare used over 20,000 different words to write his plays. Linguistically speaking, where are you on the 3,000 - 60,000+ English vocabulary scale?

tomato...&quot;love apple&quot;
Your friends, the ones who pronounce it &quot;toe-mah-toe&quot;, are historically correct. The tomato plant came from the New World-- Mayans were first to cultivate it--to Spain and was called tomate. Americans didn't eat tomatoes until about 1830. Why? They thought they were poisonous. It's partially true. The vine of the plant is poisonous. As for their designation as &quot;love apples&quot;...there is much conjecture and numerous tales as to how this came about. The most reasonable tale tells how courtly Sir Walter Raleigh presented a tomato to Queen Elizabeth and with courtly suggestiveness advised her it was &quot;an apple of love.&quot; Given the various tales, it is not surprising that tomatoes soon became a &quot;wicked aphrodisiac.&quot; To this day, the tomato's common name in German is still Liebesapfel, and the expression hot tomato for a seductive and sexy woman is common to many languages.

potato... a tuber by the wrong name
Although it is one of the world's most important vegetables, it has been incorrectly named. Potato derives from the Haitian word batata, for &quot;sweet potato,&quot; which the Spaniards found in the West Indies in 1526 and introduced to Europe. Batata was corrupted to patata in Spanish and further corrupted by the English to potato. Then, the Spaniards discovered the Peruvian white potato, an unrelated plant, and ignoring the native name for it--papas--gave it the same name as the earlier tuber, and it, too, became known as potato in England. The English made a distinction between the two unrelated vegetables, and the one came to be called the sweet potato and the other white potato. And where, oh where, does spud come from? You guessed it--from the spade-like tool used to dig potatoes.

apricot...&quot;early ripe&quot;
The Romans gave this relatively early ripening but small fruit a big name, calling it praecoquum. By the time the word entered Arabic, it lost a couple of letters and became alburquq; by the time Portuguese was through with it, it had regained a couple of letters and became albricoque. In England, it morphed into apricock. It wasn't until the 18th century that the Roman praecoquum became what we now call it, namely apricot.

salt... highly valued seasoning
In ancient times, salt was highly valued, so much so that spilling it was an unlucky omen for the Romans. Roman soldiers were paid in salt (sal), so valuable a seasoning and preservative it was thought to be.
pepper...&quot;dried berries of climbing shrub&quot;
The word for this spicy condiment can be traced all the way back to the Sanskrit pippali. Garden peppers are not related to this shrub but were named the same when Columbus discovered hot varieties of garden peppers in the West Indies. He mistakenly believed they were simply a new variety of the old climbing shrub peppers. 

gadget...&quot;little mechanical thing&quot;
A relatively new word as words go, gadget dates back to only 1886 and likely derives from the French gachette.

pumpkin...&quot;a fruit cooked by the sun&quot;
This member of the squash family originated in the Americas. Originally, the word for pumpkin probably came from the Greek pepon, a kind of melon. Pumpkins were so plentiful and everywhere among the Pilgrims that someone wrote: &quot;we have pumpkins at morning and pumpkins at noon, if it were not for pumpkins we would soon be undoon.&quot;

Douglas R. Howland. Translating the West: Language and Political Reason in Nineteenth-Century Japan. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2002. Xiv + 292 pp. Notes, glossary, illustrations, bibliography, index. $56.00 (cloth), ISBN 0-8248-2462-8. 
Reviewed by Kirsten Refsing, Department of Japanese Studies, The University of Hong Kong.
Published by H-US-Japan (August, 2002) 




Are we certain that we know what our words mean? 
The title of this review is drawn from the conclusion (p.184) to Howland's book about how western political concepts were introduced into the Japanese language during the Meiji period, and it neatly encapsulates the central focus of his work. Howland claims that many historians writing about political ideas in Japan have assumed that &quot;a word is a word is a word&quot;, and if the Japanese used e.g. the word jiyuu at a particular moment in time, they meant &quot;liberty&quot;--no more, no less. His books show abundantly that such an assumption is a gross simplification. 

Translating the West starts out with a long introduction setting out the parameters for the study. Howland outlines his project, which is to analyze the intellectual dynamics in the debate among Japanese scholars and intellectuals who conceptualized the process of modernization and civilization. The new vocabulary needed in this process in the early years after the Meiji Restoration came mainly from English, and its introduction into a Japanese context was not a one-time event, but rather the result of trial and error and several contesting viewpoints. To analyze how this process played out, Howland employs terminology and concepts from semiotics (transcoding material from one linguistic context to another), pragmatics (meaning is constituted through usage), Begriffsgeschichte (concept history), and, of course, from history, which is his main scholarly background. The introduction gives a brief overview of the introduction of Western learning, presents the Meirokusha intellectual elite, and describes how historians have traditionally treated the bunmeikaika (&quot;civilization and enlightenment&quot;) process. He also discusses the problem of semantic transparency of foreign concepts, and finally the connections between concept, word, and meaning. 

Chapter 2 is devoted to &quot;civilization and enlightenment,&quot; and the debates on of how this should be brought about--from above or from below. Japanese intellectuals were well aware that the written language posed a formidable barrier to universal education and popular enlightenment by its archaic forms and complicated characters. Several solutions were proposed, of which the most successful was the movement to shift to writing colloquial rather than classical Japanese. Learning Chinese came under attack as backwards and outdated, but was defended by scholars of Chinese and eventually remained alive and well. Howland points to the important role played by the Chinese characters in mediating between Japan and the West in terms of translation. Rather than borrowing foreign words and incorporating them as loanwords, in most cases the Japanese preferred to avail themselves of the infinite possibilities for semantic extensions or neologisms present in the Chinese characters. Apart from this practical consideration, learning Chinese helped fill the moral and ethical vacuum perceived as resulting from the excessive new materialism. 

Chapter 3 concentrates on translation techniques and how the transcoding of Western terms transformed the Japanese language (like Chinese had done from the fifth century onwards). The majority of the new words were coined with the help of Chinese characters. Often different choices were made by different translators or even by the same translator over time. Only later were katakana brought in to help, and the first attempts at formal standardization of common terms began in the 1880s. Actual standardization took place through the repeated usage of specific terms, which gradually brought some consensus, and a more widespread understanding of their meanings. Of course, the fact that the meanings of many terms were contested in their language of origin did not make the task easier. Howland operates with two analytical constructs, authenticity and accessibility, with regard to the translators' task: the former gives priority to the original text and attempts a close and exact translation as far as possible, while the latter prioritizes the Japanese target audience and changes the original text as necessary to ensure understanding. Several developments further helped to provide accessibility of the translated texts, such as the introduction of punctuation and development of printing techniques that made it possible to mark loanwords in the text for easy recognition. 

With these preliminaries behind him, Howland proceeds to analyze in detail the history of the concept and translation of three key terms between the 1860s and the 1890s, namely &quot;liberty&quot;, &quot;rights&quot; (ken as used to represent rights, privilege, power, authority, and sovereignty), and &quot;society&quot;. He traces their interpretations in the West, as well as the many different uses they were put to by different people and in different contexts. The three chapters devoted to these terms are impressive in terms of the meticulousness with which each term is traced in the writings of the time, and in terms of providing the historical context necessary to understand the different usages. In the conclusion, Howland refers to the difficulty inherent in grasping particular meanings of terms at a particular time in the face of the general fluidity of language, and he briefly discusses another key term of the period, namely &quot;nation&quot;. 

One third of Howland's book (100 pages) is taken up by endnotes, glossary, bibliography and index, of which the endnotes constitute more than half. This is a testimony to the enormous amount of research behind the study and the diverse interdisciplinary background of the author. To linguists and anthropologists the interconnectedness of language and culture is hardly a new discovery, and they are generally well aware of the &quot;double bind&quot; inherent in translation: every culture has concepts, which do not have easily available equivalents in another language. If you translate them anyway, you are stuck with a less than optimal equivalent. If, as many prefer to do, you leave them in the original language and attach a longish explanation the first time it occurs, you may be criticized for needless mystification of a foreign concept. Howland may at times seem overly impressed with his own discovery of the cultural boundness of abstract concepts, but this in no way detracts from the significance and usefulness of his work. 

To this reviewer who has a background in Japanese Studies and an interest in translation, the main contributions of Translating the West lie in two attributes: Firstly, it is written from a historian's point of view with the fruitful addition of a good grounding in semiotics and the history of ideas, and, secondly, in its thorough empirical specificity, namely the translation problems encountered by the Japanese intellectual elite, who translated and introduced Western liberal concepts to Japan between 1860 and 1890. 

However, while reading, however I found myself wondering how other target groups might perceive this book. The cover text claims that the book will interest scholars of East Asian Studies, translation studies, and historians of political thought. Knowledge of the Japanese language is therefore not a prerequisite for readers. Indeed, non-Japanese speakers can enjoy a detailed explanation of what a syllabic alphabet is (p. 47). It seems, nevertheless, difficult to imagine what scholars, who do not know Japanese, can gain from this book if they are not already familiar with Japan at least to the extent of knowing what syllabic writing is. 

For those who know Japanese well, there is a curious contradiction inherent in the fact that by choosing to write the book such that it is readable to people with no knowledge of Japanese, Howland gets into the same quandary as the Japanese intellectuals of whom he writes. Namely, he has to represent Japanese translation words for English concepts, in English. This kind of &quot;back-translation&quot; is quite frustrating for the reader who knows Japanese and would dearly like to know what the Japanese word in question was. Thus, when Howland quotes Nishi Amane's ponderings over the difficulties of translating Joseph Haven's Mental Philosophy and writes that Amane created neologisms for words &quot;such as &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;sensibility&quot;, &quot;sense&quot;, and &quot;understanding&quot;&quot;, this reader cannot help wondering what words Amane actually created in Japanese for these terms (pp. 82-83). The &quot;Glossary of Translation Words&quot; beginning on p. 249 is not much help in this context, since it contains only Japanese words in Roman letters and characters. 

Howland maintains a sometimes uneven balance between writing for historians, with no specific knowledge of Japan (or Japanese), and writing for specialists in East Asia or in translation studies. Each of these groups will definitely gain something from the book, but in its totality, it may only genuinely appeal to other scholars specializing in the Meiji period.

If English was written like Chinese

The English spelling system is such a pain, we'd might as well switch to hanzi-- Chinese characters. How should we go about it? 

Japanese style

One way would be to use hanzi directly, asthe Japanese do. For instance, we'd write &quot;work&quot; as , and &quot;ruler&quot; as . Chinese and Japanese borrowings could be written using the original hanzi, e.g. &quot;gung-ho&quot; would be , and &quot;tycoon&quot; as . 

You can already see that this is going to be tricky. We've just given  two readings, for instance-- /wrk/ and /gûng/-- and  two as well-- /rulr/ and /kun/. 

Proper names will be a problem as well. Again, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names already have hanzi forms-- e.g.  for the name of the bodaciously cute singer Faye Wong-- but for English names we'd have no better recourse than to spell things out using the nearest Chinese syllables. For instance, Winston Churchill would be represented by hanzi that would be transliterated Wensuteng Chuerqilu. 

Chinese style

Maybe there's a better approach. Instead of using hanzi directly, let's invent a new system-- we'll call it yingzi, &quot;English characters&quot;-- that would work for English exactly as hanzi works for Chinese. 

The basic principle will be, one yingzi for a syllable with a particular meaning. So two, to, and too will each have their own yingzi. (If we were creating a syllabary, by contrast, we'd write all three with the same symbol, the one for /tu/.) 

Does that mean we need a completely separate symbol for each of the thousands of possible English syllables? Not at all. We can simplify the task enormously with one more principle: syllables that rhyme can have yingzi that are variations on a theme. 

Little pictures

You've been reading for half a page and are probably wondering why I haven't yet talked about pictograms. When do we get to draw little pictures? 

Well, now's the time. Let's draw pictures. For instance: 

horse  
mount  
king  
man  
child  
bug  
sun  
moon  
tree  

When the pictures are abstract we can call them &quot;ideograms&quot;, but they still represent particular English morphemes: 

one  
un-  
per  

Some of our pictures will be kind of clever. For instance,  woods repeats the yingzi for tree, while  east is a little picture of the sun rising through the trees.  guilt is a picture of a man inside an enclosure. 

Let's not go crazy, however. We only need a thousand or so, and we'll restrict ourselves to fairly simple, one-syllable words. We'll derive the vast majority of our yingzi from this basic stock of pictures. 

Phonetic classes

Basically each simple yingzi will be the basis for an open-ended set of yingzi, used for a set of rhyming syllables. For instance, the king character  will generate the family king, thing, sing, sling, sting, shing(le). 

It would be awfully confusing to use  for all of these. Instead we'll use it only for king, which will be the phonetic for this set, and add little signs called radicals to distinguish the rest. Examples: 

sing will be , formed by adding the mouth radical 
sting will be , formed by adding the bug radical (since insects sting) 
shing (the first syllable in shingle) will be , formed using the roof radical 
sling  will be formed using the spear radical. 
When we add a radical, we scrunch up the yingzi so the whole thing still fits into a square. All characters, however complex, fit into the same size box. 
&quot;Rhyming&quot; isn't quite accurate. We don't want each family of words to get too large; so we'll restrict a single family to either voiced or unvoiced initial consonants. 

So, bring, ring, Bing, wing, zing will form a separate family of yingzi, based on the character  wing. 

Overlaps and secondary derivations
The yingzi formed from a single phonetic will all rhyme; but not all syllables that rhyme will necessarily have the same yingzi. This is largely because we started with a set of pictograms chosen for their pictorial rather than phonetic qualities; but it also adds visual distinctions to the script, and thus aids the reader. (It rather burdens the writer; but heck, everyone does a lot more reading than writing.) 

For instance, the phonetic  un- will be used for fun, ton, pun, thun(der), Hun, etc. But sun will have its own yingzi, , and this will be used for son, shun, stun, spun. For instance, sun plus the man radical makes  son, and sun with the fight radical is used for  shun. 

Moreover, a compound yingzi may itself be used as a phonetic with its own set of yingzi. The shun character , for instance, will be used with the work radical to form  -tion, used to spell this common suffix, as in  section. 

Radicals
Where do the radicals come from? For the most part they are either simple characters (e.g king, work), or abbreviations of characters; for instance the character  net is abbreviated to  when used as a radical. 

The set of radicals is not unlimited; there is in fact a fixed set of 214 of them. The total number of yingzi that belong to one phonetic set is thus absolutely limited to 214. No set will actually have this number of yingzi, though some will have a few dozen. 

(However, the potential number of yingzi is still unlimited, because we can always choose a compound yingzi as a new phonetic, and generate a new set of rhyming yingzi from it.) 

Because the set of radicals is limited, a really good radical will not always be available to distinguish the yingzi in a rhyming set. We'll just choose the best one we can. In addition, when choosing radicals we will rely on the etymological meaning of a word, which may not always match its current meaning. For instance, the word villain originally meant peasant, and so the sign for vill-  uses the field radical (added to the phonetic bill). 

The yingzi that use a particular radical will form a class of their own-- a sort of meaning class. We can consider the entire English language to be divided into 214 meaning categories. For instance, every yingzi that uses the bug radical will have something to do (at least etymologically) with insects or reptiles. However, since the number of radicals is so limited, and because the choice of radical is sometimes quirky, the resulting sets will be rather vague and eccentric. 

Guessing at an unknown character

There will be tens of thousands of yingzi; but we must not let this frighten us. There are tens of thousands of conventional spellings, too, but despite what the wiseacres say, it would be absurd to say that there's no logic to English orthography at all. Likewise, the yingzi themselves are not the basic graphical units or graphemes of the writing system; the phonetics and radicals are. 

Readers can make use of this fact to guess the pronunciation of an unknown character. For instance,  is a straightforward combination of the  speech radical with the phonetic  purse. A type of speaking that rhymes with purse-- curse, of course. 

Or, , a combination of the plant radical  with the guilt phonetic . Something about plants that rhymes with guilt? This one is a bit harder-- wilt. 

 -- a plant (radical plant) that rhymes with  speech-- is easy: peach. But note that speech, which we used as a radical above, is used as a phonetic here. 

Since there are many more phonetics than radicals, the information content of the radical is much less than that of the phonetic. If you knew only the radical for an unknown character, you can only narrow down the meaning to 1/214 of the lexicon; if you knew only the phonetic, you could narrow it down much further, since there are more than a thousand phonetics. 

Polysyllabic words

Where possible we will divide a word into morphemes. For instance outsider breaks into out + side + -er; reshipment is re- + ship + -ment. 

How do we handle morphemes of more than one syllable? We simply create a yingzi for each syllable. For instance, person would be expressed as . The first character is based on  per, with the addition of the man radical; the second is  sun with the addition of the same radical. 

A polysyllabic morpheme, in fact, can generally be recognized because all the syllables have the same radical. For instance,  insect consists of in and sect, each with the addition of the bug radical. (Note that sect is itself a compound character, formed from the rite radical with the specked phonetic.) 

Inflections
How about inflections that don't form a full syllable, such as plural -s? It would be pretty tiresome, even with the add-a-radical trick, to create thousands of yingzi for syllables that just happen to have a final -s. 

Note, however, that the plural morpheme sometimes takes up its own syllable, as in grasses, rashes. So why not use the yingzi for is, which is ? Of course, is and -s are both pretty common, so we should add a little dot to the character to represent final -s:  So peach is , peaches is ; sun is , suns is . We can use a similar strategy for other inflections. 

Foreign words
Very old borrowings (e.g. the mass of words borrowed in medieval and Renaissance times from French and Latin) will be treated like native words. We've already seen examples like peach, villain, insect, and person. 

Words borrowed more recently, however, won't get their own radical+phonetic compounds. Instead we'll represent them, syllable by syllable, using the nearest existing characters. For instance, Peking will be represented as . The first character is the first syllable of pecan (that is, pe-; phonetic see, radical gourd), and the second is the word king. The name Fellini will be written , composed of the yinzi fell, lean, knee. (You may amuse yourself working out what the phonetics and radicals are for these three characters.) 

Dictionaries
English dictionaries would no longer be arranged alphabetically, of course, since we're no longer using an alphabet. They'll be organized by radical. 

The 214 radicals are ordered according to the number of strokes needed to draw them. Radicals of one stroke (e.g. http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/one.gif one or http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/per.gif per ) come first, followed by radicals of two strokes (e.g. http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/not.gif un-), and so on, up to monstrosities like http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/toad.gif toad, which has 20 strokes. 

The section for each radical is also organized by stroke number. Under the plant radical, for instance, the first entry is http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/plant.gif plant itself, followed by characters with one extra stroke (like http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/dron.gif dron, the last character in rhododendron), then characters with two strokes, and so on (up to http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/toads.gif, the first character in toadstool). 

Note that there are no main entries for what we're used to calling words at all. There wouldn't be a main entry at all for a word like person, for instance. There would be an entry for the man radical; under it a sub-entry for the character per, and person would be listed as a sub-sub-entry under that. 

Thinking in yingzi 
The nature of the writing system would encourage lexicographers (and English speakers) to think of everything in the language as built out of yingzi. There wouldn't seem to be a great difference between &quot;words&quot; like storehouse, storage, restore and &quot;expressions&quot; like shoe store, store up, store detective, store manager; or between blackboard and black eye, or between alphabet and alpha male. 

Many morphemes that now live out a shadowy existence, forever bound to other morphemes, would take on an independent existence; for instance the volve in revolve, evolve, involve, devolve, which would have its own yingzi, and would seem as much a &quot;word&quot; or component of the language as the match in rematch, mismatch, unmatch. There would be a tendency to describe the meanings, vague or miscellaneous as they might be, for such characters. 

This might seem sensible and even wise for a morpheme like volve, which after all derives from a real Latin root meaning roll; but there would be other, more dubious applications. For instance, the son in person was represented by http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/son.gif, which happens to be the yingzi for son. It will be almost impossible not to assume that person derives from son; but historically it's just a coincidence; person derives from Latin and has nothing to do with son. 

Worse yet, the -cuit of biscuit and circuit might be written with the same character (a derivative of kit), and a meaning sought for it-- perhaps 'round', since biscuits are round and circuits involve going round. Again, etymologically this is nonsense. 

Words, perceived as compounds, might lend themselves to abbreviation. After all, why write two yingzi when one will do, especially if it unmistakably implies its partner? For instance, language would be a two-character word http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif
http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/gwidge.gif, each character defined only as part of this compound and used nowhere else in the language. If you've written lang, you must write gwidge next. You might as well just write http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif lang and leave it at that. Ultimately of course http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif will acquire a meaning of its own-- namely language. And for consistency's sake lexicographers might well give gwidge a meaning of its own as well--namely, language. 

The complexities of the writing system, the inherent interest of the pictorial elements, the cleverness inherent in graphic compounds like woods and the radical-phonetic system, and even sociological facts such as the time it takes to learn the system, and the fact that English speakers of all nations can use it whatever their native dialect, would also combine to give the writing system an overwhelming character of its own. It would be seen as more important than speech; there would even be a tendency to think of words as derived from characters rather than the other way around. 

If someone asks where a word comes from, we (now) think of its original phonetic form; we say for instance that language comes from French langage, itself derived from Latin lingua 'tongue', which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European dnghu. With the yingzi system, people would be tempted instead to give what we might call the graphic etymology. They'd say that lang derives from the speech radical and the gang phonetic, and that the latter is actually a picture of a gang-- a reduplication of the man character. That is indeed where http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif comes from, but not lang, which did not derive from it! (But it wouldn't even be easy to make this point in yingzi-- how do you distinguish lang from http://www.zompist.com/yingzi/lang.gif if you can't even write &quot;lang&quot; without writing the character?) 

A word is a word is a word

Does all this mean that words are cultural constructs or that the concept of a word would no longer apply to English written in yingzi? Not at all. A word is still a useful linguistic concept-- or rather a series of overlapping concepts. By word linguists may mean one or all of the following: 

a phonological unit-- e.g. something with one stress accent or one pitch contour; or a unit within which intervocalic stops get voiced. 
the abstraction underlying a set of morphological forms (e.g. write underlying write, writes, writing, written, wrote). 
an element which can stand alone (e.g. in response to a suitably chosen question), as suffixes or bound morphemes cannot. 
a morphological unit you can't insert other morphemes into (e.g. black dog is not a word since you can change it to black, tired dog; but you can't turn blackbird into blacktiredbird) 
an expression with a conventional meaning-- something that has to be defined in the mental lexicon (this sense is also called a lexeme). 
A moment's thought should show that these definitions may or may not coincide even in English; and that even where they do they may not coincide with the typographical or lexicographical notion of a word. The latter idea-- roughly 'something with spaces around it'-- is of little interest to linguists since it depends on the writing system. That makes it useless for describing most of the languages of the world; and even for written languages it's pretty arbitrary, as this page should show. (Everything you know about writing English would change if we adopted yingzi instead.) 

It's safe to say, however, that such definitions would seem fairly abstract in a yingzi system. Word might become a technical term, like morpheme or lexeme. Or it might be identified with a yingzi (a written character); or be abstracted into a more vaguely defined linguistic element, applicable to anything from a character to a compound to a whole phrase.

Hey, did I just learn something about Chinese?

I've attempted in this sketch to lay out, by analogy, the nature and structure of the Chinese writing system. All of the concepts apply: 

the limited role of pictograms 
the clever compound pictures (indeed all three examples are from Chinese) 
the phonetic-and-radical system (97% of Chinese characters work this way) 
the inclusion of radicals as part of the character (rather than as separate symbols, as in cuneiform or hieroglyphic writing) 
the relative information content of radicals and phonetics 
compounds used as secondary phonetics 
the handling of multisyllabic and foreign words 
the handling of subsyllabic morphemes (the model here is Mandarin -r, represented by ér) 
the organization of dictionaries (in fact, the graphic at the top of the page shows part of the radical index for a Chinese dictionary, organized by stroke count) 
the psychological effects. 
The radicals named are all also Chinese radicals. The phonetics are not, of course, since the phonetics in hanzi refer to the sounds of Chinese words, not English ones. But I tried to pick phonetics which would also be phonetics in Chinese (e.g. sun, king, wing, tree, one, east, field, bill). 

There are differences, too. For instance, I haven't made any attempt to make my yingzi look like hanzi. 

The phonetic sets of Chinese are not exactly based on rhymes. Karlgren explains that the hanzi belonging to one set had homorganic initial consonants (e.g. k, g), the same main vowel, and the same final consonant. 

I've also underreported the complexity (and arguably the inefficiency) of the Chinese script in several important ways: 

The phonetic sets in Chinese, though still useful, are two thousand years out of date. It's as if my yingzi phonetics had to rhyme in Proto-Germanic, not in modern English. 
The scribes who devised hanzi often went wild adding radicals, creating multiple characters for what are etymologically the same root. 
Four milennia have reduced the pictorial content of the hanzi primitives almost to nil. What the &quot;pictograms&quot; are pictures of is often evident only to the scholar. 
Clear and precise handwriting is by no means a virtue in Chinese; the most admired style, câoshu, is highly simplified, suggesting rather than delineating the characters intended. 
The People's Republic has simplified many of the traditional hanzi; and this reform has been accepted in Singapore but not in Taiwan or Hong Kong. It's as if the US had its own versions of a large fraction of English yingzi. 
I also haven't gotten into the many additional complications engendered when hanzi were adopted by Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese; for more on that see John DeFrancis's The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy. 

In some respects, however, yingzi are harder than hanzi. For instance, English has many more multisyllabic morphemes than Chinese. Only about 10% of Chinese morphemes are more than one syllable long. Also, English has borrowed so much that it often has five or six morphemes where Chinese would have just one-- compare wáng vs. king, regal, royal, regicide, Rex, or zì vs. word, verb, logograph, bon mot.

The connections of language, thought and social structure 

By studying language, even the pre-historic, linguists discover a wealth of societal information
By Susan Williams  

Auger 
Languages are tools that allow speakers to communicate and exchange information. So, they must contain words and expressions that refer to the various elements present in their environments. 
 
 A word is a word is a word—not! 

To turn a phrase, there is much more to the utterance of a single word than meets the tongue. 

Ask Julie Auger, assistant professor of linguistics and French at IU Bloomington. Auger is a sociolinguist whose specialization is variation studies. Her research deals with spoken French and a little known language spoken in France called Picard. She also teaches about language and gender. 

Not every linguist agrees upon how sociolinguistics fits into the study of the human language faculty. Some see it standing along side of other sub-disciplines, such as morphology, syntax, phonology, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics and anthropolotical linguistics. Others, however, believe that sociolinguistics is a redundant term, that all linguistics must be social. In any case, everyone agrees that we can learn something about a society by studying its language. 

“Languages are tools that allow speakers to communicate and exchange information,” said Auger, “So, they must contain words and expressions that refer to the various elements present in their environments. 

“The existence of a word reflects the existence of a thing that is recognized as an entity different from some other thing. For example, the existence of the words “water,” “ice,” “snow” and “steam” in English means that English speakers recognize four different things, even though all these things consist of H2O. The reverse is not necessarily true, however. Even if a single word is used for two things, it doesn’t mean that the difference between them is not recognized, so one must be very careful,” said Auger, who points out that while the word “leg” can be used in a general sense, we clearly recognize that the leg of a table and a dog’s leg are not the same. 

Sometimes, said Auger, to determine the values of a society, it’s worth looking at how language evolves, how words change in meaning. 

“In French, the word ‘crétin,’ which is a regional form of the word meaning ‘Christian,’ has come to mean ‘stupid,’ probably because the Christian habit of not hitting back was seen as a sign of weakness and stupidity,” she said. 

Studying the language of a lost culture may not hold its every key, but it still can be revealing. According to Auger, words that a linguist can reconstruct indicate the animals, plants, tools and other objects that were present in the lives of the people who spoke that language. That information can help geographically locate where the language used to be spoken. 

“For example, we have been trying to learn more about the people who spoke the language that is the common ancestor of Hindi, Greek, Parsi, Russian, English, French, Albanian and so many other languages spoken in Asia and in Europe,” said Auger. “Based on the names of animals and plants that we believe existed in that pre-historic language, we have a vague idea that these people lived in the temperate forest of northern or eastern Europe.” 

Linguistics can also provide important information concerning who was in contact with whom at a certain time. And also which cultures were more powerful and/or prestigious than others. 

“French borrowed many words from Italian during the 15th and 16th centuries because Italian culture was so advanced at that time,” said Auger. “Because this took place not such a long time ago, we have many different ways of knowing about this. But, when contact took place 2,000 or more years ago, sometimes the only way we know that group A knew and talked to group B is if we find a word from one language in the other.” 

Relatively new as a field of linguistics, but at least as old as Adam and Eve themselves as a concept, is the study of how men and women use language differently. Along with other areas of gender studies, this specialty promises a new wealth of societal information, including whether or not the social changes that are taking place in the roles of women and men are reflected in language. But here, and in all other areas of linguistic study, research will proceed with caution. 

“Any analysis we come up with is only a theory,” said Auger, “We must always be ready to admit the existence of alternative theories and be ready to revise our theory. We also must seek confirmation from other disciplines whenever possible—archaeology, sociology, anthropology and genetics, for instance. 

“There is a connection between language, thought and social structure, but this connection is incomplete and imperfect.”</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}

A verb's voice shows the relationship between the subject and the action expressed by the verb. Latin has two voices: active and passive.

In the active voice, the subject of the clause performs the verb on something else (the object), e.g., &quot;The girl sees the boy.&quot;

In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action of the verb, e.g., &quot;The boy is seen by the girl.&quot;

The personal endings in the active voice are: '''-ō'''/'''-m''', '''-s''', '''-t''', '''-mus''', '''-tis''', '''-nt'''.

The personal endings in the passive voice (present, imperfect, future) are: '''-r''', '''-ris''', '''-tur''', '''-mur''', '''-mini''', '''-ntur'''. 

In the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect, the passive voice is formed by the fourth principal part plus the proper forms of '''sum, esse'''. For the perfect tense, use the present forms of '''esse''', for the pluperfect use the imperfect forms of '''esse''', and for the future perfect use the future forms of '''esse'''. The fourth principal part, when used in a passive construction, acts as a first-second declension adjective and is declined accordingly.

As stated before, when the passive voice is used, the subject receives the action of the verb from another agent. This agent, when it is a person, is expressed by the preposition '''ā'''/'''ab''' plus the ablative case. This construction is called the ''ablative of personal agent''. The ''ablative of cause'' is used without a preposition when the agent is not a person.

==Examples:==

*Active: ''Puella puerum videt.'' (The girl sees the boy.)

:*Passive: ''Puer ā puellā vidētur.'' (The boy is seen by the girl.)
:''Puella'' takes ''ā'' and the ablative, as it is a personal agent.

*Active: ''Timor virum capit.'' (Fear seizes the man.)

:*Passive: ''Vir timore capitur.'' (The man is seized by fear.)
:''Timore'' is ablative of cause.

*Active: ''Hostēs urbem oppugnābant.'' (The enemies were attacking the city.)

:*Passive: ''Urbs ab hostibus oppugnābatur.'' (The city was being attacked by the enemies.)

==Deponent verbs==

Some verbs are always passive in form, even though they have an active meaning. For example:

*filius agricolam &lt;b&gt;sequitur&lt;/b&gt; - The son follows the farmer
*sol &lt;b&gt;ortus est&lt;/b&gt; - The sun has risen
*agricola hostes &lt;b&gt;verentur&lt;/b&gt; - The farmers fear the enemies
*gladio &lt;b&gt;usus sum&lt;/b&gt; - I used a sword

Some, called semi-deponent verbs, take on a passive form on only in the perfect. For example:

*colono &lt;b&gt;confido&lt;/b&gt; - I trust the farmer
*colono &lt;b&gt;confisus sum&lt;/b&gt; - I trusted the farmer

Note that some deponent and semi-deponent verbs take the accusative case (eg. vereor, vereri, veritus sum = I fear), some the ablative (eg. utor, uti, usus sum = I use) and some the dative (eg. confido, confidere, confisus sum = I trust). When you first encounter such a verb in Latin, be sure to remember the case of the object the verb is taking along with its spelling and meaning.

'''Meat loaf''' is a meat dish, usually cooked in a [[Cookbook:Loaf Pan|bread loaf pan]], made from [[Cookbook:Beef|ground beef]] and some sort of binder, often eggs, and seasoned with various spices and sauces. It is generally made by simply blending all ingredients together in a bowl, and is thus a quick and easy dish to prepare.

There are several recipes for meatloaf available in this cookbook:
* [[Cookbook:Meatloaf I|Meatloaf I]]; with [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]].

==Changing mass==

So far we've assumed that the mass of the objects being considered is constant, which is not always true. Mass is conserved overall, but it can be useful to consider objects, such as rockets, which are losing or gaining mass.

We can work out how to extend Newton's second law to this situation by considering a rocket two ways, as a single object of variable mass, and as two objects of fixed mass which are being pushed apart. 

&lt;!-- Diagram, full calculations --&gt;

We find that 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} =  \frac{m d(\mathbf{v})}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Force is the rate of change of a quantity, ''m'''''v''', which we call ''linear momentum''.

==Newton's third law==

&lt;!-- Diagram goes here --&gt;

Newton's third law says that the force, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; exerted by a mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, on a second mass, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is equal and opposite to the force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; exerted by the second mass on the first.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(m_2\mathbf{v}_2)}{dt}= \mathbf{F}_{12}= - \mathbf{F}_{21} 
=  -\frac{d(m_1 \mathbf{v}_1)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

if there are no external forces on the two bodies. We can add the two momenta together to get,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(m_1\mathbf{v}_1)}{dt}+\frac{d(m_2 \mathbf{v}_2)}{dt}
=\frac{d}{dt}(m_1\mathbf{v}_1+m_2\mathbf{v}_2)=0&lt;/math&gt;

so the total linear momentum is conserved.

Ultimately, this is  consequence of space being homogeneous.

==Centre of mass==

Suppose two constant masses are subject to external forces, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Then the total force on the system, '''F''', is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}= \mathbf{F}_{1}+\mathbf{F}_{2} =
\frac{d}{dt}(m_1\mathbf{v}_1+m_2\mathbf{v}_2)&lt;/math&gt;

because the internal forces cancel out.

If the two masses are considered as one system, '''F''' should be the product of the total mass and ''ā'', the average acceleration, which we expect to be related to some kind of average position.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}(m_1+m_2)\bar{a} &amp; = &amp; \frac{d}{dt}(m_1\mathbf{v}_1+m_2\mathbf{v}_2) \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{d^2}{dt^2}(m_1\mathbf{r}_1+m_2\mathbf{r}_2)\\
\bar{a}&amp; = &amp; \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \frac{m_1\mathbf{r}_1+m_2\mathbf{r}_2}{m_1+m_2}\\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The average acceleration is the second derivative of the average position, ''weighted by mass''.

This average position is called the ''centre of mass'', and accelerates at the same rate as if it had the total mass of the system, and were subject to the total force.

We can extend this to any number of masses under arbitrary external and internal forces.

*we have ''n'' objects, mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;hellip; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, total mass ''M''
*each mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is at point '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,
*each mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is subject to an external force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;
*the internal force exerted by mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; on mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;   is '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;

then the position of the centre of mass, '''R''', is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\frac{\sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

We can now take the second derivative of '''R'''

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{ccl}
M \ddot\mathbf{R} &amp; = &amp; \sum_i m_i \ddot\mathbf{r}_i \\
&amp; = &amp; \sum_i (\mathbf{F}_i +\sum_j \mathbf{F}_{ij}) \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

But the sum of ''all'' the internal forces is zero, because Newton's third law makes them cancel in pairs.  Thus, the second term in the above equation drops out and we are left with:

:&lt;math&gt;M \ddot{\mathbf{R}} = \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i = \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;

The centre of mass always moves like a body of the same total mass under the total external force, irrespective of the internal forces.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

A '''Southwestern Scramble''' is a  scrambled eggs recipe with many spicy ingredients, such as onions and chilis.  For a complete breakfast, serve with sliced, fried [[Cookbook:Wiejska|wiejska]] ([[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]), [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]], and [[Cookbook:Orange|orange juice]].

==Ingredients==
*8 [[cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*2 tablespoons (30 [[cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 medium red [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*1 medium green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], such as [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]], seeded and chopped
*1 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], seeded and sliced
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], to taste
*Serve with [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]], such as [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking spray]], for [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]

==Procedure==
#Chop the onion and chili, and slice the bell pepper.  Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl, add the milk, and beat until well combined.
#Place a large [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]] over medium heat, add the butter, margarine, or cooking spray, and allow to melt.  Add the onions, chili, and bell pepper, and sauté for 2-4 minutes.
#Add the eggs to the pan, and allow to cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until they just begin to set.  Turn the heat up to high, and begin ''scrambling'' the eggs by scraping the bottom of the pan with a spatula and folding the cooked egg into the egg mixture.
#When the eggs are still moist, but mostly cooked, remove from the fire and plate.  
#Serve while still hot.

==Tips and tricks==
*To adjust the spiciness, use more or fewer chili peppers, or use types varying levels of heat.
*The chilis are seeded because of the intense heat in the seeds, where the majority of the ''[[w:Capsaicin|capsaicin]]'' is.  The seeds can be left in, but the scramble will be much hotter.
*Be sure to scrape the entire bottom of the pan, as well as the sides.  Otherwise, those areas where the egg is not scraped will burn.
*Carryover heat will continue to cook the eggs, so they should be removed from the fire while still slightly underdone, otherwise they will be over cooked.

'''''Fahrenheit 451''''' is an excellent [[en:science-fiction|science-fiction]] novel. If you liked [[en:George Orwell|George Orwell]]'s ''[[en:1984 (novel)|1984]]'', this is a must-read.  The novel covers a range of issues including [[en:censorship|censorship]], [[en:war|war]], the impact of [[en:technology|technology]] on [[en:society|society]], and [[en:life|life]] in general. 

I enjoyed reading this novel, and could not put it down once I started it. I love science-fiction, so I am biased in this review, but my friend, who doesn't particulary care for science fiction, was the one who persuaded me to read this great book.

This book is a classic and should be a required novel for all [[en:high schooler|high schooler]]s(in many states it is). I urge you to take the time to read this story. You will be glad that you did.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just thought people should know that the following statement from this page on electromagnets is wrong:

''Rermember current flows from thwe positive to the negative terminals on the power pack. If the current''  

The negative pole on a battery is called negative because of the build-up of excess electrons that have a negative charge, and it is the electrons that &quot;flow&quot; from the negative pole to the positive.  The terms positive and negative were assigned according to properties observed in experiments with static electricity before anyone understood what was causing the phenonema.  By the time it was discovered that it was an excessive of particles (now called electrons) that caused the effect, that end had already been assigned the label &quot;negative&quot; giving us the image of an absence of substance.  It is a very common misunderstanding to think electricity &quot;flows&quot; (another misunderstanding)from positive (in popular language indicating having more of something) to negative (an area of less), when this is actually the opposite of what happens.

You are quite right that '''electrons''' flow from negative to positive. However '''current''' flows from positive to negative. It's just terminology left over from the days when we didn't know about electrons. It's unfortunate, but we are stuck with it. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:07, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

== Graphics and Grips ==

I literally stared at the &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot; graphics for minutes until it dawned on me what was trying to be conveyed.
Might I suggest that the N and S symbols are scaled to fit in two, same diameter circles (dotted) and graphically treated to fit the circle.
Then I'm sure I'd have a more rapid path to enlightenment.

On another note: I know about a right-hand grip technique to aid memory of polarity but does everyone? Again, might I suggest a graphic here?

== Web Services Overview ==

&lt;b&gt;Web Services&lt;/b&gt; are a new breed of Web application. They are self-contained, self-describing, modular applications that can be published, located, and invoked across the Web. Web services perform functions, which can be anything from simple requests to complicated business processes. Once a Web service is deployed, other applications (and other Web services) can discover and invoke the deployed service. Web services make use of XML to describe the request and response, and HTTP as its network transport.

&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between a Web Service and a &lt;b&gt;web application&lt;/b&gt; relates to collaboration. Web applications are simply business applications which are located or invoked using web protocols. Similarly, Web Services also perform computing functions remotely over a network. However, Web Services use internet protocols with the specific intent of enabling inter operable machine to machine coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Services have emerged as a solution to problems associated with distributed computing. &lt;b&gt;Distributed computing&lt;/b&gt; is the use of multiple systems to perform a function rather than having a single system perform it. The previous technologies used in distributed computing, primarily Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), had some limitations. For example, neither has achieved complete platform independence or easy transport over firewalls. Additionally, DCOM is not vendor independent, being a Microsoft product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the primary needs for a distributed computing standard were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform support for Business to Business, as well as internal, communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concordance with existing Internet infrastructure as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability, both in number and complexity of nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internalization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance of failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vendor independence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitability for trivial and non-trivial requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, business information systems became highly configured and differentiated. This inevitably made system interaction extremely costly and time consuming. Developers began realizing the benefits of standardizing Web Service development.   
Using web standards seemed to be an intuitive and logical step toward attaining these goals. Web standards already provided a platform independent means for system communication and were readily accepted by information system users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result was the development of Web Services. A Web Service forms a distributed environment, in which objects can be accessed remotely via standardized interfaces. It uses a three-tiered model, defining a service provider, a service consumer, and a service broker. This allows the Web Service to be a loose relationship, so that if a service provider goes down, the broker can always direct consumers to another one. Similarly, there are many brokers, so consumers can always find an available one. For communication, Web Services use open Web standards: TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML based SOAP.&lt;/p&gt; At higher levels technologies such as XAML, XLANG, (transactional support for complex web transactions involving multiple web services) and  XKMS (ongoing work by Microsoft and Verisign to support authentication and registration) might be added.

== SOAP ==
[[File:SOAP.svg|thumb|right|220px|SOAP structure]]
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)&lt;/b&gt; is a method for sending information to and from Web Services in an extensible format. SOAP can be used to send information or remote procedure calls encoded as XML. Essentially, SOAP serves as a universally accepted method of communication with web services. Businesses adhere to the SOAP conventions in order to simplify the process of interacting with Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;SOAP:Envelope xmlns:SOAP=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;&gt;
 &lt;SOAP:Header&gt;

  &lt;!-- SOAP header --&gt;

 &lt;/SOAP:Header&gt;
 &lt;SOAP:Body SOAP:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;

  &lt;!-- SOAP body --&gt;

 &lt;/SOAP:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SOAP message contains either a request method for invoking a Web Service, or contains response information to a Web Service request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adhering to this layout when developing independent Web Services provides notable benefits to the businesses. Due to the fact that Web Applications are designed to be utilized by a myriad of actors, developers want them to be easily adoptable. Using established and familiar standards of communication ultimately reduces the amount of effort it takes users to effectively interact with a Web Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SOAP Envelope is used for defining and organizing the content contained in Web Service messages. Primarily, the SOAP envelope serves to indicate that the specified document will be used for service interaction. It contains an optional SOAP Header and a SOAP Body.  Messages are sent in the SOAP body, and the SOAP head is used for sending other information that wouldn't be expected in the body. For example, if the SOAP:actor attribute is present in the SOAP header, it indicates who the recipient of the message should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web service transaction involves a SOAP request and a SOAP response. The example we will be using is a Web Service provided by Weather.gov. The input is latitude, longitude, a start date, how many days of forecast information desired, and the format of the data. The SOAP request will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?/&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope
      SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot; 
      xmlns:SOAP-ENV=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;&gt;
     
     &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
        &lt;m:NDFDgenByDayRequest xmlns:SOAPSDK1=&quot;http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/DWMLgen/wsdl/ndfdXML.wsdl&quot;&gt;
           &lt;latitude xsi:type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;&gt;33.955464&lt;/latitude&gt;
           &lt;longitude xsi:type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;&gt;-83.383245&lt;/longitude&gt;
           &lt;startDate xsi:type=&quot;xsd:date&quot;&gt;&lt;/startDate&gt;
           &lt;numDays xsi:type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/numDays&gt;
           &lt;format&gt;24 Hourly&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;/m:NDFDgenByDayRequest&gt;
     &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
     
  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The startDate was left empty because this will automatically get the most recent data. The format data type is not defined because it is defined in the WSDL document. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The response SOAP looks like this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?/&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope
      SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot; 
      xmlns:SOAP-ENV=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;&gt;
     
     &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
        &lt;NDFDgenByDayResponse xmlns:SOAPSDK1=&quot;http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/DWMLgen/wsdl/ndfdXML.wsdl&quot;&gt;
           &lt;dwmlByDayOut xsi:type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;.....&lt;/dwmlByDayOut&gt;
        &lt;/NDFDgenByDayResponse&gt;
     &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
     
  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SOAP handles data by encoding it on the sender side and decoding it on the reciever side.  The data types handled by SOAP are based on the W3C XML Schema specification.  Simple types include strings, integers, floats, and doubles, while compound types are made up of primitive types.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;element name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;SOAP:Array SOAP:arrayType=&quot;xsd:string[2]&quot;&gt;
     &lt;string&gt;Web&lt;/string&gt;
     &lt;string&gt;Services&lt;/string&gt;
  &lt;/SOAP:Array&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because they are text based, SOAP messages generally have no problem getting through firewalls or other barriers.  They are the ideal way to pass information to and from web services.
&lt;/p&gt;

== Service Description - WSDL ==
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Web Service Description Language (WSDL)&lt;/b&gt; was created to provide information about how to connect to and query a specific Web Service. This document also adheres to strict formatting and organizational guidelines. However, the methods, parameters, and service information are application specific. Web Services perform different functionality and contain independent information, however they are all organized the same way. By creating a standard organizational architecture for these services, developers can effectively invoke and utilize them with little to no familiarization. To use a web service, a developer can follow the design standards of the WSDL to easily determine all the information and procedures associated with its usage.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;/p&gt;Essentially, a WSDL document serves as an instruction for interacting with a Web Service. It contains no application logic, giving the service a level of autonomy. This enables users to effectively interact with the service without having to understand its inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an example of a WSDL file for a web service that provides a temperature, given a U.S. zip code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, messages are used by the operations to communicate - in other words, to pass parameters and return values.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
   &lt;message name=&quot;NDFDgenByDayRequest&quot;&gt;  
      &lt;part name=&quot;latitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;longitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;startDate&quot; type=&quot;xsd:date&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;numDays&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;format&quot; type=&quot;typens:formatType&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/message&gt;

   &lt;message name=&quot;NDFDgenByDayResponse&quot;&gt;
      &lt;part name=&quot;dwmlByDayOut&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the WSDL file, a consumer should be able to access data in a web service.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

== Service Discovery - UDDI ==
&lt;p&gt;
You've seen how WSDL can be used to share interface definitions for Web Services, but how do you go about finding a Web Service in the first place? There are countless independent Web Services that are developed and maintained by just as many different organizations. Upon adopting Web Service practices and methodologies, developers sought to foster the involvement and creative reuse of their systems. It soon became apparent that there was a need for an enumerated record of these services and their respective locations. This information would empower developers to leverage the best practices and processes of Web Services quickly and easily. Additionally, having a central reference of current Web Service capabilities enables developers avoid developing redundant applications. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
UDDI defines registries in which services can be published and found.  The UDDI specification was creaed by Microsoft, Ariba, and IBM.  UDDI defines a data structure and Application Programming Interface (API).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the three-tier model mentioned before, UDDI is the service broker.  Its function is to enable service consumers to find appropriate service providers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connecting to UDDI registries using Java can be accomplished through the Java API for XML Registries (JAXR).  JAXR creates a layer of abstraction, so that it can be used with UDDI and other types of XML Registries, such as the ebXML Registry and Repository standard.
&lt;/p&gt;

== Using Java With Web Services ==
&lt;p&gt;To execute a SOAP message, an application must be used to communicate with the service provider. Due to its flexibility, almost any programming language can be used to execute SOAP message. For our purposes, however, we will be focusing on using Java to interact with Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Using Java with web services requires some external libraries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache SOAP Toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Mail Framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaBeans Activation Framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xerces XML parser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let's go through using Java to query the Temperature Web Service we talked about earlier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;
import org.apache.soap.util.xml.*;
import org.apache.soap.*;
import org.apache.soap.rpc.*;

public class TempClient
{

 public static float getTemp (URL url, String zipcode) throws Exception 
 {

  Call call = new Call ();

  // Service uses standard SOAP encoding
  String encodingStyleURI = Constants.NS_URI_SOAP_ENC;
  call.setEncodingStyleURI(encodingStyleURI);

  // Set service locator parameters
  call.setTargetObjectURI (&quot;urn:xmethods-Temperature&quot;);
  call.setMethodName (&quot;getTemp&quot;);

  // Create input parameter vector
  Vector params = new Vector ();
  params.addElement (new Parameter(&quot;zipcode&quot;, String.class, zipcode, null));
  call.setParams (params);

  // Invoke the service ....
  Response resp = call.invoke (url,&quot;&quot;);

  // ... and evaluate the response
  if (resp.generatedFault ()) 
  {
   throw new Exception();
  } 
  else 
  {
   // Call was successful. Extract response parameter and return result
   Parameter result = resp.getReturnValue ();
   Float rate=(Float) result.getValue();
   return rate.floatValue();
  }
 }

 // Driver to illustrate service invocation
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
  try
  {
   URL url=new URL(&quot;http://services.xmethods.net:80/soap/servlet/rpcrouter&quot;);
   String zipcode= &quot;30605&quot;;
   float temp = getTemp(url,zipcode);
   System.out.println(temp);
  }
  catch (Exception e) 
  {
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Java code effectively hides all the SOAP from the user.  It invokes the target object by name and URL, and sets the parameter ''zipcode''. But what does the underlying SOAP Request look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:n=&quot;urn:xmethods-Temperature&quot;
      xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;
      xmlns:soapenc=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;
      xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
      xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;

     &lt;soap:Body soap:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;n:getTemp&gt;
           &lt;zipcode xsi:type=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;30605&lt;/zipcode&gt;
        &lt;/n:getTemp&gt;
     &lt;/soap:Body&gt;

  &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you see, the SOAP request uses the parameters passed in by the Java Call to fill out the SOAP envelope and direct the message.  Similarly, the response comes back into the Java program as '70.0'. The response SOAP is also hidden by the Java program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
  &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope 
      xmlns:SOAP-ENV=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot; 
      xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; 
      xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;

     &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
        &lt;ns1:getTempResponse xmlns:ns1=&quot;urn:xmethods-Temperature&quot; 
            SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
           &lt;return xsi:type=&quot;xsd:float&quot;&gt;70.0&lt;/return&gt;
        &lt;/ns1:getTempResponse&gt;
     &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;

  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an additional example of using Java and SOAP to interact with Web Services. This particular Web Service is called the &quot;US Zip Validator&quot; and takes a ZipCode as a parameter, which then returns a corresponding latitude and longitude. When developing applications to interact with Web Services, the first step should be to review the WSDL document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WSDL document for this service is located here: [http://www.webservicemart.com/uszip.asmx?WSDL http://www.webservicemart.com/uszip.asmx?WSDL]

&lt;p&gt;This document will contain all the necessary instructions for interacting with the &quot;US Zip Validator&quot; Web Service.&lt;/p&gt;

        }
      }
    }
  } 
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Java class refers to an XML document(SOAPRequest.xml), which is used as the SOAP message. This document should be included in the same project folder as the Java application invoking the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the &quot;US Zip Validator&quot; WSDL document, it is clear that we would like to invoke the &quot;getTemp&quot; method. This information is contained within the SOAP body and includes the appropriate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOAPRequest.xml&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:n=&quot;urn:xmethods-Temperature&quot;
      xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;
      xmlns:soapenc=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;
      xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
      xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;

     &lt;soap:Body soap:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;n:getTemp&gt;
           &lt;zipcode xsi:type=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;30605&lt;/zipcode&gt;
        &lt;/n:getTemp&gt;
     &lt;/soap:Body&gt;

  &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a successful interaction, the Web Service provider will provide a response that is similar in format to the user request. When developing in NetBeans, run this project and examine the subsequent SOAP message response in the Tomcat output window. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

==Web Services with Netbeans==
&lt;p&gt;
The Netbeans version used for this explanation is 5.0.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After Netbeans is open, click on the &quot;Runtime&quot; tab on the left pane, then right-click &quot;Web Services&quot; and select &quot;Add Web Service.&quot; In the &quot;URL&quot; field, enter the address of the web service WSDL file, in our example above it is &quot;http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/DWMLgen/wsdl/ndfdXML.wsdl&quot; and click Get Web Service Description. This will bring up the information of the web service. 
&lt;/p&gt;

==Summary==
{| style=&quot;background: linen; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;
|- 
| Web services are applications that use XML to communicate with many different systems to perform a task. To facilitate the use of web services, protocols were developed that allow them to be flexible and scalable. SOAP is used to send and define information and WSDL was created to provide information about how to connect to and query a web service. UDDI describes where these web services can be found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Have vectors been introduced already when this page is presented?  If not, then the implied use of vector notation (bold variables) will make little sense to the students. 

I always preferred to start from '''F'''=m'''a'''  since it allows introduction of &quot;real-world&quot; situations.  Even without calculus you can introduce pushing a cart, throwing a ball, etc.  As written, I fear that the only problem that can be intruduced is droping a ball in one dimension.  The next situation (multiple objects, spacecraft, etc) follows more naturally from the force based discussion.  I also like to introduce Newton at his point to illustrate that science is a series of &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; actions.

Evelien:
Interestingly enough, I have started a textbook on Physics in Dutch recently, and Newton and Galilei are exactly my starting points. I think I will be watching this English language parallel of my own effort closely in the future. My intended audience is somewhat younger though: &gt;12 or (bright) &gt;10 year olds will be my audience...

1 Displacement, velocity, and acceleration, also known as linear motion or kinematics

The title should NOT merely duplicate the names of subheaders.

==small comments==
1) I guess x(e) should be x(t)

2) you might mention that whenever you use v at a time t or a at a time t you are using the instantaneous forms.
[[User:207.67.146.242|207.67.146.242]] 21:40, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

3) The graphic showing the Cartesian Coordinates, shows a mistake: the &quot;y&quot; axis actually corresponds to the &quot;z&quot; axis and the shown &quot;z&quot; axis it is actually the &quot;y&quot; axis. Please re-edit the graphic and show the right one, because it is misleading -Sherpa2007

== Confusion between Displacement and Direction ==

Under the section of &quot;Displacement,&quot; I found this confusing sentence.

Calculate the '''distance''' you traveled along each of these segments, and then add all your results together.

Shouldn't that bold-faced distance actually be displacement, as noted later in paragraph?
Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seemed to me that displacement would be the most logical answer.

Further note: 
the whole sentences about distance and displacement are ill-posed since they fail to note that distance is a scalar whereas displacement is a vector. 

Additionally, should it be noticed that displacements are independent of coordinate systems, whereas positions are not?

== section: &quot;Constant acceleration&quot; / first Box ==

The first box in the section &quot;Constant acceleration&quot; currently displays the special case of zero acceleration (dv/dt=0 m s^-2). It should be changed to display the general case of constant acceleration. To do so one could simply switch the &quot;v&quot; with an &quot;a&quot; and adjust the units, or else keep the &quot;v&quot; and exchange the zero with &quot;const.&quot; (as this would fit the description given right above the box more closely).</text>

&lt;center&gt;''OpenOffice.org User's Manual:''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''OpenOffice.org'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[Image:OpenOffice.org 3 icon.png]]&lt;/center&gt;
'''OpenOffice.org''' is a free, open source alternative to Microsoft Office&lt;ref&gt;Wikibooks: [[Microsoft Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; and WordPerfect. It provides almost all of the functionality at no cost to the end user. You can read more about the creators and the project's goals [http://about.openoffice.org/index.html here].

This manual also works for [[LibreOffice]].

== Applications ==
[[Image:Openoffice-splash.png|thumb|OOo splash screen]]OpenOffice.org is as an office suite, is divided into several related sub-applications. These applications are designed to work together but can also work like a stand alone programs:
* [[/Writer/]]: word processor
* [[/Calc/]]: spreadsheet
* [[/Impress/]]: presentation program
* [[/Draw/]]: vector graphics editor
* [[/Base/]]: database management program
* [[/Math/]]: formula editor

== General Features ==
* [[/Macro/]]: OpenOffice.org can be scripted through OpenOffice.org Basic, Python, Beanshell, and Javascript, this feature is more widely known as using Macros.
* [[/Find &amp; Replace/]]: OpenOffice.org's Find and Replace Function, from simple search and replace to the use of Regular Expressions.

== Technical ==
* [[/OASIS File Format/]]

== Miscellaneous topics ==
* [[/Performance Tips/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to OpenOffice.org startup even faster, try these speed boosting tricks.

*Upgrade to the latest stable version.
*Upgrade your RAM, OpenOffice.org alone needs at least 256 Mb, but it will be a lot happier with more. Refer to recommended (not minimum) RAM requirements of your operating system and desktop environment.
*Use native file formats, converting to other formats takes time.

===General settings===
;Visual
*In Tools &amp;gt; Options &amp;gt; View:
:*Switch off showing icons in menus
:*Disable showing previews of fonts
:*Disable anti-aliasing (where the option exists), if you don't require this or if your desktop environemnt does the anti-aliasing job itself;
:*Consider using the Classic icon style or one that matches your desktop environment (the latter may be pre-set if you use a distribution geared towards a specific desktop environment).

;Languages, spelling and grammar
*Disable spelling and grammar extensions for languages you don't use (disabling some may require superuser rights);
*Disable automatic spelling and grammar checking in&lt;BR&gt;Tools &amp;gt; Options &amp;gt; Language Settings &amp;gt; Writing Aids &amp;gt; Options subsection &amp;mdash;
:Uncheck the following options:
:*&quot;Check spelling as you type&quot;;
:*&quot;Check grammar as you type&quot;.

===System-specific information===
;Windows
*Use the [[../Quickstarter|quickstarter]] for faster application start-up. Note that Using the QuickStarter may increase the time for system initialisation.

;Linux
*Have you run [[../Prelink|prelink]]?&lt;SUP&gt;&amp;#91;[[w:Prelink]]&amp;#93;&lt;/SUP&gt;
*If you are using Linux, use your distribution's packages, they are typically more optimized than the plain ones.

*If you try renaming a folder containing a new OO document, you may get an error message saying the folder can't be renamed because it's being used--even if you've closed the document. Here's a workaround: Just move the document out of that folder, rename the folder and move the document back in.

===Version-specific information===
====Version 2.0====
In 2006, there were some benchmarks which showed that OOo-2.0 still used a lot of memory and was slower than MS-Office, but OOo developers promised that they were working on improvements.

;System requirements
This version branch requires at least 128 Mb of RAM to run properly.&lt;BR&gt;Running OO.o 2.x off a LiveCD (such as Knoppix) without swap space requires 2&amp;ndash;4 times as much, depending on whither window manager (such as IceWM) or desktop enviornment (like KDE/GNOME) you use.

;Disabling writing aids
By default, OpenOffice.org 2.x and earlier include a number of writing aids (dictionaries and thesauri). By version 2.4, the amount of these is extensive, with writing aids for approximately 25 languages and language variants, and all are loaded into memory when starting OO.o.

For everyday use, most languages' and some of their variants' dictionaries can be turned off through&lt;BR&gt;Tools &amp;gt; Options &amp;gt; Language settings &amp;gt; Writing Aids &amp;mdash;
*Click the [&lt;SPAN STYLE=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;E&lt;/SPAN&gt;dit...] button next to &quot;Available language modules&quot; section;
*In &quot;Edit Modules&quot; window, choose all unnecessary languages from the drop-down menu and then uncheck their respective spelling, grammar, hyphenation, and thesaurus modules in the list below. When done, click the Close button to exit the window and then click OK to exit the Options window. Restart OO.o.

====Version 1.x====
In early versions of [[OpenOffice.org]], before 1.1, it was cursed with a severe speed problem, taking a long time to load, often over a minute. As of May 2004, that issue seems to have been resolved with OO.o 1.1.

;Requirements
This version branch needs at least 64 Mb of RAM to run properly.

===Compiling===
If you are compiling OpenOffice.org, make sure you are using the right cflags. A well tuned selection can have a 20% increase. Using the latest version of GCC can also make a big difference.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''OpenGL Programming''' book. OpenGL is an API used for drawing 3D graphics. OpenGL is not a programming language; an OpenGL application is typically written in C or C++. What OpenGL does allow you to do is draw attractive, realistic 3D graphics with minimal effort. The API is typically used to interact with a GPU, to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

You are free, and encouraged, to '''share''' and '''contribute''' to this wikibook: it is written in the spirit of [[Wikibooks:Welcome|free documentation]], that belongs to humanity. Feel free to make copies, teach it in school or professional classes, improve the text, write comments or even new sections.

'''We're looking for contributors.''' If you know about OpenGL, feel free to leave comments, expand TODO sections and write new ones!

      <comment>/* Tempered Tuning */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Advances in manufacturing have solved many of the tuning problems associated with the budget guitars of yesteryear. Entry level guitars are available from major manufacturers such as Yamaha and Fender which are entirely suitable for beginners. All guitar stores sell tuning forks and electronic tuners. A tuning fork provides a single reference note for tuning and for this reason an electronic tuner will be more useful to the complete beginner.    

When new strings have been put on a guitar they often fall out of tune very easily. New strings will stretch until they reach a point where their elasticity diminishes and then they will remain at the correct tension and frequency. Strings need to be broken in. It will take time to work all the slack out of the strings but the process can be sped up. Put on new strings and tune to just below concert pitch using an electronic guitar tuner. Then pull each string an inch away from the fretboard and this will instantly put them out of tune. Use your electronic guitar tuner to retune the strings to just below concert pitch and repeat the process. After a while the slack should be gone from the strings and the guitar can be tuned to concert pitch and should stay in tune. 

==Tuning the Guitar==
Sound is created by the disturbance of particles in the air. The vibrations of a struck string causes the air particles to moves in waves which the ear receives and the brain interprets. When a string is attached to two points, as the strings on a guitar are, then striking it causes a sound to be produced at a regular frequency. The length, thickness and tension of the string determines the pitch of the note it produces. If you have a string of a certain length and tension stretched across a wooden board which produced a known frequency and you wished to double the frequency to produce the note an octave above - you simply halve the distance that it is stretched across and keep the same tension. That is exactly what happens on a guitar when you fret any of the open strings at the twelfth fret.

There are many different tunings for the open strings of the guitar but the most common is known as standard tuning or E tuning. In standard tuning the open strings should be tuned to the notes '''E A D G B e'''. 

The diagram below illustrates the open strings and the twelfth fret. Note that the upper case '''E''' represents the thickest string and the lower case '''e''' represents the thinnest string. The diagram is orientated towards the player's view. 


[[File:Guitar_Fretboard_Open_Strings_Diagram.png|1400px]]


 e|-----------------------|
 B|-----------------------|
 G|-----------------------|
 D|-----------------------|
 A|-----------------------|
 E|-----------------------|

===Four-Five Tuning===
Four-Five tuning uses the open A string as the first reference note. A tuning aid is useful to ensure that the open A string is at concert pitch.  

Concert pitch is an Internationally agreed standard that assigns A = 440 Hz. The guitar is a transposing instrument and is notated an octave higher than its actual pitch to avoid having to use the bass clef in standard notation. The notated middle C is played on the third fret of the A string though the pitched middle C is to be found on the first fret of the B string. A = 440 Hz is the fifth fret of the high e string but for convenience the open A string (110 Hz) is used as the reference note. 

The diagram below shows the notes to be fretted.

 e|-------------------0---|
 B|---------------0---5---|
 G|-----------0---4-------|
 D|-------0---5-----------|
 A|---0---5---------------|
 E|---5-------------------|

Follow these six steps to tune your guitar using the Four-Five method:

[[File:Guitar Four-Five Method Tuning A note for reference Step 1.png]]
'''Step 1'''
[[File:Guitar Four-Five Method Tuning D string to A string Step 2.png]]
'''Step 2'''
[[File:Guitar Four-Five Method Tuning G string to D string Step 3.png]]
'''Step 3'''
[[File:Guitar Four-Five Method Tuning B string to G string Step 4.png]]
'''Step 4'''
[[File:Guitar Four-Five Method Tuning e string to B string Step 5.png]]
'''Step 5'''
[[File:Guitar Four-Five Method Tuning E string to e string Step 6.png]]
'''Step 6'''

It is recommended that strings be brought up to their correct pitch when tuning. The Four-Five method has the disadvantage of progressively increasing tuning inaccuracies by the use of multiple reference notes.

===Harmonic Tuning===
This method of tuning uses harmonics. By lightly touching a string directly above its fret-wire the fundamental of a note is silenced leaving only a series of overtones. Any note played on any instrument consists of a fundamental and a harmonic series of overtones. The twelfth, seventh and fifth nodes are the easiest frets with which to sound harmonics. After striking the string the finger should be removed quickly to produce the harmonic. 

The fretboard diagram below shows the pairs of harmonics that are used. You start by tuning the harmonic on the 7th fret of the A string to the harmonic on the low E string. Then the harmonic on the 7th fret of the D string is tuned with the harmonic on the 5th fret of the A string. Tuning the G string to the D string is done in the same manner. Tune the harmonic on the B string to the harmonic on the 4th fret of the G string. Tune the harmonic on the e string to the harmonic on the B string.

 e|-------------7*------------|
 B|--------5*-----------------|
 G|------4*-----7*------------|  * = Play a harmonic at this fret
 D|--------5*---7*------------|
 A|--------5*---7*------------|
 E|--------5*-----------------|

[[File:Guitar Fretboard Tuning Diagram Natural Harmonics.png|1400px]]

Tuning with harmonics can progressively increase tuning errors due to the use of multiple reference notes. The fundamental is the most dominant frequency of the harmonic series and it is recommended that a further tuning check be made using fretted notes.

===Tempered Tuning=== 
This method is recommended because it applies equal temperament with the use of a single reference note. This method uses the open high e string as the reference note. You tune the unison and octave E notes that are found on the other strings to the open high e string. Hold the fretted note down as you turn the tuning peg and you will feel the string move under your fingertip. This involves striking the strings with your right hand and then using the right hand to turn the tuning pegs. If may feel awkward at first but with practice it becomes familiar. The open low E string is the only string to be tuned to the high e string without fretting. The fretted note on the 5th fret of the B string should be tuned wide by the amount of two beats per second in relation to the high e string.

= Participles =

'''Participles''' are verbs which function grammatically like adjectives.  English, aided by auxiliary participles, is able have participle phrases in many tenses. Latin has participles that do not have auxiliary supplementary participles. This limits the usage of the participle in Latin, according to some wiki-scholars of Classical Studies.

== Present Active Participles ==

Present participles are formed by adding -ns to the stem of the verb.

|}

Present Participles are declined like 3rd declension adjectives.  In cases besides the nominative, the -s becomes -t.

Examples:

1. ferens, ferentis
2. capiens, capientis
3. ens, entis

=== Exercises ===

Form the Present Participle and translate of the following Latin verbs:

* meto, messui, messum, ere
* metuo, metum, ui, ere
* milito, avi, atum, are
* postulo, avi, atum, are
* sulco, avi, sulcum, are
* iacio, ieci, iactum, ere

=== Uses ===


The examples will show participles of the verb ''amo, amare, amavi, amatum'' (to love). 

* '''present active''': base + 'ns.' This forms a two-termination 3rd declension adjective. In the case of ''amare'', the participle is ''amans, amantis'' (loving).
* '''perfect passive''': fourth principle part, with appropriate first or second declension endings: ''amatus, -a, -um''.
* '''future active''': fourth principle part, minus 'm', add 'rus, -a, -um' This forms a 1st-2nd declension adjective: ''amaturus, -a, -um'' (about to love).

In deponent verbs, the perfect passive participle is formed in the same way as in regular verbs.  However, since the nature of the deponent verb is passive in form and active in meaning, the participle is translated actively.

Remember that participles are adjectives, and therefore must be declined to agree with the noun which they modify in case, number and gender.

== Gerund ==

The gerund is a verbal noun which is used to refer to the '''action''' of a verb. For example: ars '''scribendi''' = the art of '''writing'''. The gerund is declined as a second declension neuter noun. It is formed by taking the present stem and adding -ndum.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| '''Verb'''
| amo, amare
| video, videre
| rego, regere
| capio, capere
| audio, audire
|-
| '''Gerund'''
| amandum
| videndum
| regendum
| capiendum
| audiendum
|}
&lt;br/&gt;
==== Meanings of the gerund ====

* Genitive: ars legendi - The art of reading / to read
* Accusative: ad puniendum - to punish, for punishing
* Ablative: saepe canendo - through frequently singing; in legendo: while reading
* Genitive with ''causa'': puniendi causa - in order to punish

==Gerundive==

The gerundive is a 1st/2nd declension adjective formed the same way as the gerund, and its function overlaps somewhat with the gerund, but otherwise differs. The literal translation of the gerundive is with &quot;to be&quot;, eg. defendendus, -a, -um = &quot;to be defended&quot;.

* Accusative: ad ludos fruendos - to the games to be enjoyed - to enjoy the games (Note that if this were a gerund construction, it would be ad lud'''is''' fruend'''um''' since ''fruor, -i'' takes the ablative case. In the gerundive construction, both noun and gerundive are governed by the preposition ''ad'')
* Gerundive of obligation: Carthago delenda est - Carthage is to be destroyed - Carthage must be destroyed. Note that if there is an object (eg. Carthage is to be destroyed '''by us'''), it goes into the dative case.

=Exercises=

1. Convert the following subjunctive purpose clauses into gerund or gerundive clauses with the same meaning. For example: militabat ut patriam defenderet -&gt; militabat ad patriam defendendum ''or'' militabat patriam defendendi causa ''or'' militabat ad patriam defendendam. Try to use each construction twice.
* casam exit ut patrem adiuvet
* mater in casam rediit ut cenam pararet
* hostes vincebant ergo scutum abieci (''I threw away my shield'') ut celerius fugerem
* in silvas currimus ut nos celemus
* hostes in silvas ineunt ut nos invenirent
* Brutus Iulium Caesarem occidit ut Romam liberaret

2. Translate into Latin. For example: I must see the temple -&gt; templum mihi videndum est
* We must build a large city.
* Julius Caesar must lead an army into Greece.
* Scipio (''Scipio, -ionis'') must defeat Hannibal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What would Piaget  (1896-1980) say to today's primary teachers to encourage a constructivist approach?

Luckily, we need not use our imagination here: Piaget dealt with elementary teachers and had very specific recommendations for them in different subject areas (Piaget, 1998, De la pédagogie.  Paris: Éditions Odile Jacob).  As early as 1921 he was hired by Claparède to become director of studies at the Jean Jacques Rousseau Institute in Geneva. He worked for the International Bureau of Education from 1929 to 1967 and Director of the Institute of Educational Sciences at the University of Geneva from 1932-1971.

Piaget's advice to teachers, in essence, was to provide conditions under which the child can be guided to learn for themselves:  Not just to master existing knowledge, but to become excited about the possibility of creating new knowledge.  What this means in different disciplines will depend on the specific topics being learned. The idea being that the student constructs their own understandings rather than being a passive recipient of knowledge.

Of course, Jean Piaget's ideas are not new. 2000 years ago, Plutarch said: &quot;The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.&quot; Plutarch (46 - 127)

Vegan Chili is chili that uses no animal or meat products in its creation.  Many variations of a vegetarian based chili have been created using meat substitutes, tofu and even vegetables.  The most popular vegan chilis use beans as the main weight of the dish, but others use tofu, eggplant, butternut squash or zucchini.  

This is a kind of [[Cookbook:Chili|Chili]] that needs no meat (and uses no ersatz meat).  Many variations are possible; the recipe is very flexible.  The molasses gives this chili a somewhat Louisiana flavor.

==Ingredients==
* 2 15 oz. cans red [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney bean]]s
* 1 15 oz. can [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black bean]]s
* 1 15 oz. can [[Cookbook:Navy Bean|navy bean]]s
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] kernels
* 1 6 oz. can [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], chopped (canned diced tomato works too)
* 2 fresh [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]]s (or your favorite [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] works too; more if you like it really hot)
* 1 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], chopped
* 1 red or yellow bell pepper, chopped
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, chopped
* 4 medium cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped or crushed
* 10 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* large pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste; not needed)
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 10 mL [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (or any other kind of vegetable oil)
* 50 mL [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Garlic Sauce|chili garlic sauce]] (optional)

==Procedure==
In a large pot, heat the olive oil with a few drops of water.  When the water starts sizzling, add the onions and garlic.  Stir until the onions are soft (optionally until they are slightly brown).  Add the chili peppers and fry for a few more seconds.  Add the tomato paste and tomato, and the chili powder, salt, and oregano.  Stir a few times then let [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]].  

Rinse the beans well and add them to the simmering vegetables.  Drain the corn and add to the vegan chili.  Add the molasses.  Taste the chili; if it needs more seasoning, add it now (perhaps with the exception of salt, as people can add this at the table).  It is probably better not to add more jalapeños at this point, but if the chili is not spicy enough, some chili sauce or chili garlic sauce can be added. Let the pot simmer, covered, for at least 30 minutes - longer will distribute the flavor better.  If the chili is too thick, add a little water; if it's too thin, uncover the pot.

Add the bell peppers, stir, and simmer for a minute or two (peppers should stay crunchy).  Serve with [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]; makes about 8 bowls, which are very filling.  Keeps well, perhaps even better the second day.

''Cook's Note:'' In making this recipe, when I got to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] part, there was no liquid in the pot to boil.  I added two cups of vegetable broth, which seemed to work well, but next time I'll try a large can of diced tomatoes.

''Cook's Note:'' It's not clear how large each of the cans should be.  Canned tomatoes in particular can come in much larger sizes than canned beans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most fundamental concepts in physics is '''energy'''. It's difficult to define what energy actually ''is'', but one useful definition might be &quot;a measure of the amount of change taking place within a system, or the potential for change to take place within the system&quot;. 

Roughly speaking, energy can be divided into two forms, ''kinetic'' and ''potential''. Kinetic energy is the energy of movement or change. Potential energy is the energy a system has as a result of being able to undergo some change. To provide a specific example, a falling book has kinetic energy, because its position in space is changing
(it is moving downwards). A book resting on a shelf has no potential energy relative to the shelf, since it has height of zero meters relative to the shelf. However, if the book is elevated to a some  height above the shelf, then it has potential energy proportional to the height at which it resides above the shelf.

An object can have both kinetic and potential energy at the same time. For example, an object which is falling, but has not yet reached the ground has kinetic energy because it is moving downwards, and potential energy because it is able to move downwards even further than it already has. The sum of an object's potential and kinetic energies is called the object's mechanical energy.

As an object falls its potential energy decreases, while its kinetic energy increases. The decrease in potential energy is exactly equal to the increase in kinetic energy.

Another important concept is '''work'''. Similarly to the way we defined energy, we may
define work as &quot;a measure of the amount of change brought about in a system, by the application of energy&quot;. For instance, you might do work on a book by picking it up off the floor, and putting it on a shelf. In doing so, you have increased the potential energy of the book (by increasing its potential to fall down to the floor). The amount of potential energy you have &quot;given&quot; to the book is exactly equal to the amount of work
you do by lifting it onto the shelf. 

Mathematically, however, energy is very easy to define.  Kinetic energy is 1/2 m v^2.  Potential energy is a little bit trickier.  Say we have a force which can be written as the gradient (a three dimensional derivative.  If you don't know what it is, pretend it is a normal derivative and you should be able to understand things in one dimension.) of some function, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; times the mass of the particle.  That is &lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = m \vec{\nabla} \phi &lt;/math&gt;.  Then potential energy is just &lt;math&gt;m \phi + C&lt;/math&gt; where C is an arbitrary constant.  What arbitrary definitions, you might say.  At first you might think so, but it turns out, the work done by the force is the change in kinetic energy (see [[../Work and Energy/]]).  They are actually very closely related.  In fact, the potential energy plus the kinetic energy due to the force is a constant!  Aha, so this &quot;arbitrary&quot; potential energy decreases at exactly the same rate this &quot;arbitrary&quot; kinetic energy increases.  They must be the same thing in different forms!  It is not so arbitrary after all.  This is the conservation of energy.  In fact, since the particles are moving at finite velocities, this is the much stronger local conservation of energy for mechanical systems.  Another amazing fact is that it appears that all forces are conservative (this changes in electrodynamics, but energy is still conserved)!  Even friction appears to be conservative on a molecular level.  A slightly more mathematical treatment is available in [[../Work and Energy/]].

We may concisely state the following principle, which applies to [[../../Glossary#closed_systems|closed systems]] (i.e. when there are no interactions with things outside the system): 
: '''In all physical processes taking place in closed systems, the amount of change in kinetic energy is equal to the amount of change in potential energy. If the kinetic energy increases, the potential energy decreases, and vice-versa.'''

When we consider [[../../Glossary#open_systems|open systems]] (i.e. when there are interactions with things outside the system), it is possible for energy to be added to the system (by doing work on it) or taken from the system (by having the system do work). In this case the following rule applies: 
: '''The total energy of a system (kinetic plus potential) increases by the amount of work done on the system, and decreases by the amount of work the system does.'''

This leads us to consider the conservation of energy and other quantities.
 
In many cases, &quot;you get out what you put in&quot;.

If you put 3 pair of socks into an empty dryer, you don't need to analyze the exact configuration of the dryer, the temperature profile, or other things to figure out how many socks will come out of the dryer. You'll get 3 pair of socks out[*].

A conservation law, in its most general form, simply states that the total amount of some quantity within a closed system doesn't change. In the example above, the conserved quantity would be socks, the system would be the dryer, and the system is closed as long as nobody puts socks into or takes socks out of the dryer. If the system is not closed, we can always regard a larger system which is closed and which encompases the system we were initially considering (e.g. the house in which the dryer is located), even though, in extreme cases, this may lead us to consider the amount of socks (or whatever) in the entire Universe!

Conservation laws help us solve problems quickly, because we know that we will have the same amount of the conserved quantity at the end of some process as we did at the start. The fundamental laws of conservation are;
* conservation of mass
* conservation of energy
* conservation of momentum
* conservation of angular momentum
* conservation of charge

Returning to our example above, the 'conservation of socks' is in fact a consequence of 
the law of conservation of mass.
 
It should be noted that in the context of nuclear reactions, energy can be converted to mass and vice-versa. In such reactions the total amount of mass plus energy doesn't change. Therefore the first two of these conservation laws are often treated as a single law of ''conservation of mass-energy''

Combining these laws with Newton's laws gives other derived conserved quantities such as
* conservation of angular momentum

Within a closed system, the total amount of energy is always conserved.  This translates as the sum of the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; changes in energy totalling to 0.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta \mathbf{E}_k = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An example of such a change in energy is dropping a ball from a distance above the ground.  The energy of the ball changes from [[/Potential energy|potential energy]] to [[/Kinetic energy|kinetic energy]] as it falls.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} U_g &amp;=&amp; m\mathbf{g}h
\\
K &amp;=&amp; {1 \over 2} m\mathbf{v}^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because this is the only change in energy within our system, we will take a simple physical problem and model it in order to demonstrate.

An object of mass 10kg is dropped from a height of 3m.  What is its velocity when it is 1m above the ground?

We start by evaluating the Potential Energy when the object is at its initial state.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
U_g &amp;=&amp; m\mathbf{g}h
\\
U_g &amp;=&amp; 30\mathbf{g}
\\
\mathbf{g} &amp;=&amp; 9.807ms^{-2}
\\
U_g &amp;=&amp; 30 \cdot 9.807
\\
U_{g3} &amp;=&amp; 294.21J
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Potential Energy of the object at a height of 1m above the ground is given in a similar fashion.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
U_g &amp;=&amp; m\mathbf{g}h
\\
U_g &amp;=&amp; 10\mathbf{g}
\\
U_g &amp;=&amp; 10 \cdot 9.807
\\
U_{g1} &amp;=&amp; 98.07J
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the change in Potential Energy is given

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} \Delta U_g &amp;=&amp; 294.21 - 98.07 = 196.14J
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, the change in Potential Energy is equivalent to the change in Kinetic Energy.  The initial KE of the object is 0, because it is at rest.  Hence the final Kinetic Energy is equal to the change in KE.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\Delta U_g &amp;=&amp; \Delta K
\\
196.14J &amp;=&amp; {1 \over 2} m\mathbf{v}^2
\\
196.14 &amp;=&amp; 5\mathbf{v}^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging for &lt;b&gt;v&lt;/b&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
{196.14 \over 5} &amp;=&amp; \mathbf{v}^2
\\
\sqrt{{196.14 \over 5}} &amp;=&amp; \mathbf{v}
\\
\mathbf{v} &amp;\approx&amp; 6.263 ms^{-1}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can check our work using the following kinematic equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{v}^2 &amp;=&amp; \mathbf{u}^2 + 2\mathbf{as}
\\
\mathbf{v}^2 &amp;=&amp; 0^2 + 2\mathbf{gs}
\\
\mathbf{v} &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{2\mathbf{gs}}
\\
\mathbf{v} &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{2\cdot 9.807 \cdot 2}
\\
\mathbf{v} &amp;\approx&amp; 6.263 ms^{-1}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This follows because we can actually use the equations for energy to generate the above kinematic equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\Delta U_g &amp;=&amp; \Delta K
\\

====Motion====

For x(t), position as a function of time

Velocity: The rate of change of position with respect to time
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{v}(t) = f'(t) = {dx \over dt}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{a}(t) = \mathbf{v}'(t) = f''(t) = {d^2x \over dt^2}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Jerk: The rate of change of acceleration with respect to time
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{j}(t) = \mathbf{a}'(t) = f'''(t) = {d^3x \over dt^3}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Jerk is not commonly used in first year motion.  Its main application is in dealing with travel of large objects that change their weight as they move due to a change in mass.  One example might be a rocket travelling up from rest.  As it burns fuel, its centre of gravity changes and as such, its acceleration is not constant (violation of Newton's Second Law).

====Mechanics (Statics)====

Given the details of the loading of a beam, we can represent it on a diagram of the beam with arrows indicating forces, curved arrows indicating moments (resistance to torque) and shaded regions representing universally varying or distributed loads.  We can use this diagram (commonly known as a free body diagram) and the information contained within it to draw a diagram representing the shear forces (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; in the beam, and can also derive an equation that represents these.  The equation may not be as simple as a polynomial, and is quite often a series of continuous functions with endpoints at the points on the beam where the forces occur.

We can perform an indefinite integral on each of these segments of the beam to get more information on it.  The indefinite integrals combine to form a diagram of the bending moments in the beam.  Bending moments are a special type of moment, as the beam is most likely to fail where the bending moments are at a relative extrema.  By definition, any indefinite integral will contain a constant, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;.  In the case of the bending moment diagram, our &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; is merely the endpoint of the previous segment.  The only exception being when we have a moment, we add or subtract its value (depending on direction).

Hence, differentiating the bending moment model will give us the shear force.

Differentiating the shear force model brings us back to our loading diagram, and differentiating that will give us the shape of the deflection of the beam under the loading.

For any bending moment model &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, as a function of distance from the end of the beam, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
b'(x) &amp;=&amp; V(x)
\\
b''(x) &amp;=&amp; V'(x) &amp;=&amp; \operatorname{FBD}(x)
\\
b'''(x) &amp;=&amp; \operatorname{FBD}'(x) &amp;=&amp; f(x)
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;i&gt;f(x)&lt;/i&gt; is a function describing the deflection of the beam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We define a '''derivative''' as the limit of a function as the ratio of the changes in the function and the changes in the variable as the change in the variable goes to zero.

i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} {df \over dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}{{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}  \over {\Delta x}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
===An example===
Quantity B is found to depend on quantity A such that B is always the square of A.

&lt;u&gt;A ..... B&lt;/U&gt;  In this case, x=A and f(x) is [the function of x] = B. Look at what happens at the point A=2 (for example). 

0 ..... 0 At x=2 f(x)=4. Changing x very slightly, by only 0.01, we have delta x=0.01, so that x+delta x is 2.01. 

1 ..... 1 Then the function of (x+delta x) = the function of 2.01 = the square of 2.01 = 4.0401. The difference between f(x+delta x) and f(x)
 
'''2''' ..... '''4''' is 4.0401 and 4. It is 0.0401. Dividing it by delta x we have 0.0401/0.01 which is 4.01, meaning that
 
3 ..... 9 the CHANGE of the function divided by the CHANGE in x is nearly 4 when x=2. If we would have made delta x much smaller

etc. ..... we would have got exactly 4, which happens to be 2 times x at x=2


* In general, if we have a polynomial of x, such as &lt;math&gt;x^3,x^4,&lt;/math&gt; etc then the derivative is as follows:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^n;  \frac{d f(x)}{dx}=nx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol for the derivative of f with respect to x.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Page  http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Electronics:Symbols  contains images that are PNG files that have a lot of KB weight. Should they not have been exported as GIFs?

The [[Wikibooks:Image use policy|policy]] is to use PNGs for all diagrams, and to only use GIFs for animations, partly because GIFs are currently encumbred by a patent. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

PNG files actually have pretty good lossless compression. They're like bitmaps but with compression algorithms used. I don't think they have very much KB weight at all.

KB weight? as in kilobytes?  look at the file sizes.  they are usually less than 1 KB.  not exactly huge files. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 12:52, 10 May 2004 (UTC)

One thing that could be done is to take the text out of the image file then crush them with an png crushing utility see [[en:Wikipedia:How_to_keep_image_file_sizes_as_small_as_possible]] for details [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:14, 10 May 2004 (UTC)

:I tried PNGCRUSH on a few of them and they are already about as small as possible.  It could only reduce them by about 10 bytes max.  They are already really really small though.  &lt;1KB is really good.  They are two-color images and compress very well.  I don't understand why someone is saying they are too big.  - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 15:51, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

:Somewhat related.  I modified Klunky.  See [[Electronics:Template]] for details. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 23:46, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

:It would probably be a good idea to have the text outside of the images, and also to have the images in separate files, for ease of editing.  At least to have groupings like resistors, variable resistors, thermistors, etc. in separate files, and put the images next to each other, like Wanderer's BJT images.  Formatting is more difficult, that way, though.  I guess it would need tables... - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 21:06, 25 May 2004 (UTC)

''Moved from article:''

Not bad.  The question is how big we want our pictures to be?  

What would really be nice is to have some sort of circuit builder.  That would be a great way to teach electronics, but it would probably be a lot of work.

Circuit builder of choice: mspaint.exe

:I think we should use Klunky.  I have mentioned this a million times.  It is easy, uniform, good look for the web, much much faster than mspaint, everyone can access it, etc. etc.  see [[Electronics:Template]] for more. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:30, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)

The Greek alphabet in the article appears to be missing omikron (it's after xi).

The kinetic energy and angular momentum of the dumbbell may be split into two parts, one having to do with the motion of the center of mass of the dumbbell, the other having to do with the motion of the dumbbell relative to its center of mass.

To do this we first split the position vectors into two parts. The centre of mass is at.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\frac{M_1 \mathbf{r}_1 + M_2 \mathbf{r}_2}{M_1+M_2}&lt;/math&gt;

so we can define new position vectors, giving the position of the masses relative to the centre of mass, as shown.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_1=\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{R}_1 \quad 
\mathbf{r}^*_1=\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{R}_1&lt;/math&gt;

The total kinetic energy is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_1 V_1^2  &amp;+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_2 V_2^2 \\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}M_1 |\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{v}^*_1|^2  &amp;+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_2 |\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{v}^*_2|^2\\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}(M_1+M_2)V^2 &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_1 {v^*_1}^2 + \frac{1}{2}M_2 {v^*_2}^2 \\ 
&amp; = &amp; K_{ext} &amp; + &amp; K_{int}\\
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the sum of the kinetic energy the dumbbell would have if both masses were concentrated at the center of mass, the ''translational kinetic energy'' and the kinetic energy it would have if it were observed from a reference frame in which the center of mass is stationary, the ''rotational kinetic energy''.

The total angular momentum can be similarly split up
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{L} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{L}_{orb} &amp; + &amp; \mathbf{L}_{spin}\\
&amp; = &amp; (M_1+M_2)\mathbf{R}\times \mathbf{V} &amp; + &amp; (M_1\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times \mathbf{v}^*_1 + M_2\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times \mathbf{v}^*_2)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

into the sum of the angular momentum the system would have if all the mass were concentrated at the center of mass, the ''orbital angular momentum'', and the angular momentum of motion about the center of mass, the ''spin angular momentum''.

We can therefore assume the centre of mass to be fixed.

Since '''&amp;omega;''' is enough to describe the dumbbells motion, it should be enough to determine the angular momentum and internal kinetic energy. We will try writing both of these in terms of ''&amp;omega;''
 
First we use two results from earlier
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathbf{v}=\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
to write the angular momentum in terms of the angular velocity


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{L} &amp; = &amp; M_1\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times \mathbf{v}^*_1 &amp; + &amp; M_2\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times \mathbf{v}^*_2\\
&amp; = &amp; M_1\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_1) &amp; + &amp; M_2\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_2)\\
 &amp; = &amp; 
M_1 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} \left( \mathbf{r}^*_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}^*_1\right) - \mathbf{r}^*_1 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_1 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} \right)\right) &amp; + &amp; 
M_2 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} \left( \mathbf{r}^*_2 \cdot \mathbf{r}^*_2\right) - \mathbf{r}^*_2 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_2 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right) \right)\\
&amp; = &amp; M_1 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} d_1^2 - 
\mathbf{r}^*_1 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_1 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} \right)\right) 
&amp; + &amp; M_2 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} d_2^2 - 
\mathbf{r}^*_2 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_2 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right) \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2) \boldsymbol{\omega} &amp; - &amp; 
\left (M_1 \mathbf{r}^*_1\left( \mathbf{r}^*_1\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right)
+ M_2 \mathbf{r}^*_2\left( \mathbf{r}^*_2\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right) \right) \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in the angular momentum is proportional to the angular velocity, as might be expected, but the second term is not.

What this means becomes clearer if we look at the components of '''L'''
For notational convenience we'll write
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1) \quad \mathbf{r}^*_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2) 
&lt;/math&gt;

These six numbers are constants, reflecting the geometry of the dumbbell.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
L_x &amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2)\omega_x  - (M_1 x_1^2+M_2 x_2^2)\omega_x \\
&amp;  &amp;  -(M_1 x_1 y_1+M_2 x_2 y_2)\omega_y -  (M_1 x_1 z_1+M_2 x_2 z_2)\omega_z \\
L_y &amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2)\omega_y  -  (M_1 x_1^2+M_2 x_2^2)\omega_y \\
&amp; &amp;  -(M_1 x_1 y_1+M_2 x_2 y_2)\omega_x -  (M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2)\omega_z \\
L_z &amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2)\omega_z  -(M_1 x_1^2+M_2 x_2^2)\omega_z \\
&amp; &amp; -(M_1 x_1 z_1+M_2 x_2 z_2)\omega_x - (M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2)\omega_y \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This, we recognise as being a matrix multiplication.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} L_x \\ L_y \\ L_z \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\ I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz} \end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix} \omega_x \\ \omega_y \\ \omega_z \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\ I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz} \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
M_1(d_1^2-x_1^2)+M_2(d_2^2-x_2^2) &amp; -(M_1 x_1 y_1 + M_2 x_2 y_2) 
&amp; -(M_1 x_1 z_1+M_2 x_2 z_2) \\
-(M_1 x_1 y_1 + M_2 x_2 y_2) &amp; M_1(d_1^2-y_1^2)+M_2(d_2^2-y_2^2)
&amp; -(M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2) \\
-(M_1 x_1 z_1 + M_2 x_2 z_2) &amp; -(M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2) &amp; M_1(d_1^2-z_1^2)+M_2(d_2^2-z_2^2) \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The nine coefficients of the  matrix '''I''' are called ''moments of inertia''.

By choosing our axis carefully we can make this matrix diagonal. E.g if 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_1 = (d_1, 0, 0) \quad \mathbf{r}^*_2 = (-d_2, 0, 0) &lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\ I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz} \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; M_1 d_1^2 +M_2 d_2^2 &amp; 0 \\  
0 &amp; 0 &amp; M_1 d_1^2 +M_2 d_2^2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Because the dumbbell is aligned along the ''x''-axis, rotating it around that axis has no effect.

The relationship between the kinetic energy, ''T'', and &amp;omega; quickly follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
2T &amp; = &amp;  M_1 {v^*_1}^2 &amp; + &amp;  M_2 {v^*_2}^2\\
&amp; = &amp; M_1 \mathbf{v}^*_1 \cdot (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_1) &amp; + &amp;
M_1 \mathbf{v}^*_2 \cdot (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_2) \\
&amp; = &amp; M_1 \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot (\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times \mathbf{v}^*_1) &amp; + &amp;
M_2 \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot (\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times \mathbf{v}^*_2)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

On the right hand side we immediately recognise the definition of angular momentum.

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for '''L''' gives

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\omega}\mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega} = \omega \mathbf{n} \quad 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n}=1 &lt;/math&gt;

this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} I  \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''momement of inertia around the axis '''n''' is '' 

:&lt;math&gt;I=\mathbf{n} \mathbf{I} \mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt;

a constant.

If the dumbbell is aligned along the ''x''-axis as before we get
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} (M_1 d_1^2 +M_2 d_2^2) (\omega_y^2+\omega_z^2)&lt;/math&gt;

These equations of rotational dynamics are similar to those for linear dynamics, except that '''I''' is a matrix rather than a scalar.

[[Cookbook:Irish Stew|Irish stew]] The stew is made with mutton or lamb, potatoes and onions; in the south carrots are included too. The liquid may be water or stock, and is sometimes thickened with barley.

[[Cookbook:Beef and Guinness Casserole|Beef and Guinness Casserole]] This is one you have to try. Back when the Irish had nothing, drink was the main diet. It was food... they used to call the pint the 'liquid food'. Nowadays the 'liquid food' is used increasingly in cooking (keeping to our roots). It is a tasty addition to stews and casseroles, helping to tenderize the meat and imparting its distinctive malty flavor to any dish. This recipe makes a wonderful gusty stew which tastes even better a day or two after it is made

[[Cookbook:Tripe and Drisheen|Tripe and Drisheen]] is a classic Cork (south county) recipe for the more adventurous as are [[Cookbook:Crubíns|Crubíns]] (Pigs Feet). A pig's foot may be used to thicken a stew.

[[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiled]] [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], boiled in the same pot. Soak the bacon in water for a night before to make it less [[Cookbook:Salt|salty]], and boil it with new water. Smoked bacon is preferred.

Many excellent wild game dishes which are not common enough but can include Guinea Fowl, Pheasant, Snipe, Venison and such like.

Many variations but standard fry consists of: Soda bread, potato bread, pancake, sausages (one pork, one beef), bacon rashers, mushrooms, fried egg(s), tomato, vegetable roll, black pudding, white pudding (some versions include a slice of steak) and a cup of tea. Heavy on cholesterol, carbohydrates and HBV proteins, some of the meat based ingredients can be substituted with beans, potato waffles or hash browns. For a healthier version, grill the meats, omit the puddings and vegetable roll and poach the eggs.

Rashers ([[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]) and [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]] and [[Cookbook:Fry|fried]] [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. Mostly for [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] or for [[Cookbook:Lunch|lunch]], but along with white pudding and black pudding they can be eaten in a roll or a [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]]. Many cafes provide &quot;all-day breakfasts&quot; due to the demand. [[Cookbook:Hash Browns|Hash browns]], [[Cookbook:Baked Beans|baked beans]] or [[Cookbook:Potato Waffles|potato waffles]] might also be included (but not in a bread roll.)

[[Cookbook:Tea|Tea]] and [[Cookbook:Toast|Toast]]. Irish people especially like teas from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], often still named as Ceylon teas. English Breakfast and Darjeeling are popular. Toast is typically made in a dedicated pop-up toaster.

[[Cookbook:Ham|Ham]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] sandwiches, toasted if possible. Ideally use real [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] and real [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], but cut the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] off the ham.

[[Cookbook:French Fries|Chips]], [[Cookbook:Curried Chips|curried chips]] or [[Cookbook:Hamburger|Burger]]s and Chips are popular, especially after a night of [[Cookbook:Alcohol|drinking]].

&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid #77FF77; background:#DDFFDD; width:80%; padding:5px; text-align:center; margin:auto;&quot;&gt;This page makes use of [[Template:Code|Color Code Boxes]]. Use the [{{fullurl:Talk:{{BOOKNAME}}|action=edit&amp;section=19}} discussion page] to leave any feedback regarding this new feature.&lt;/div&gt;

Return to [[PHP Programming#The_Basics|The Basics]].

==The Code==
===Simple Hello World===
{{Code:Output
|&quot;Hello World.&quot; is the first program most beginning programmers will learn to write in any given language. Here is an example of how to print &quot;Hello World!&quot; in PHP.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
  echo &quot;PHP is so easy!&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;Hello World!
PHP is so easy!&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

This is as basic as PHP gets. Three simple lines, the first line identifies that everything beyond the ''&lt;?php'' tag, until the ''?&gt;'' tag, is PHP code. The second line causes the greeting to be printed (or ''echoed'') to the web page. This next example is slightly more complex and uses variables.

===Hello World With Variables===
{{Code:PHPHTML
|This example stores the string &quot;Hello World!&quot; in a variable called ''$string''. The following lines show various ways to display the variable ''$string'' to the screen.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  // Declare the variable 'string' and assign it a value.
  // The &lt;br&gt; is the HTML equivalent to a new line.
  $string = 'Hello World!&lt;br&gt;';

  // You can echo the variable, similar to the way you would echo a string.
  echo $string;

  // You could also use print.
  print $string;

  // Or, if you are familiar with C, printf can be used too.
  printf('%s', $string);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;Hello World!&lt;br&gt;Hello World!&lt;br&gt;Hello World!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

The previous example contained two outputs. PHP can output HTML that your browser will format and display. The ''PHP Output'' box is the exact PHP output. The ''HTML Render'' box is approximately how your browser would display that output. Don't let this confuse you, this is just to let you know that PHP can output HTML. We will cover this much more in depth later.

==New Concepts==
===Variables===
'''Variables''' are the basis of any programming language: they are &quot;containers&quot; (spaces in memory) that hold data. The data can be changed, thus it is &quot;variable&quot;.

If you've had any experience with other programming languages, you know that in some of the languages, you must define the type of data that the variable will hold. Those languages are called ''statically-typed'', because the types of variables must be known before you store something in them. Programming languages such as [[Subject:C++|C++]] and [[Java Programming|Java]] are statically-typed. PHP, on the other hand, is ''dynamically-typed'', because the type of the variable is linked to the value of the variable. You could define a variable for a string, store a string, and then replace the string with a number. To do the same thing in C++, you would have to cast, or change the type of, the variable, and store it in a different &quot;container&quot;.

All variables in PHP follow the format of a dollar sign ($) followed by an identifier i.e. $variable_name. These identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning that capitalization matters, so $wiki is different from $Wiki.

====Real world analogy====
To compare a variable to real world objects, imagine your computer's memory as a storage shed. A variable would be a box in that storage shed and the contents of the box (such as a cup) would be the data in that variable. 

If the box was labeled ''kitchen stuff'' and the box's contents were a cup, the PHP code would be: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$kitchen_stuff = 'cup'; 
&lt;/source&gt;

If I then went into the storage shed, opened the box labeled ''kitchen stuff'', and then replaced the cup with a fork, the new code would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$kitchen_stuff = 'fork'; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the addition of the '''&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;''' in the middle and the '''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;''' at the end of the code block. The '''&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;''' is the assignment operator, or in our analogy, instructions that came with the box that states &quot;put the cup in the box&quot;. The '''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;''' indicates to stop evaluating the block of code, or in our analogy, finish up with what you are doing and move on to something else.

Also notice the cup was wrapped in single quotes instead of double. Using double quotes would tell the PHP parser that there may be more than just a cup going into the box and to look for additional instructions. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$bathroom_stuff = 'toothbrush'; 
$kitchen_stuff = &quot;cup $bathroom_stuff&quot;;
 
//$kitchen_stuff contents is now '''cup toothbrush'''
&lt;/source&gt;

Single quotes tell the PHP parser that it's only a cup and not to look for anything more. In this example the bathroom box that should've had its contents added to the kitchen box has its name added instead.
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$bathroom_stuff = 'toothbrush';
$kitchen_stuff = 'cup $bathroom_stuff';
 
//$kitchen_stuff contents is now '''cup $bathroom_stuff'''
&lt;/source&gt;
So again, try to visualize and associate the analogy to grasp the concept of variables with the comparison below. Note that this is a real world object comparison and '''&lt;u&gt;NOT PHP&lt;/u&gt;''' code.
 Computer memory (RAM) = storage shed
 Variable = a box to hold stuff
 Variable name = a label on the box such as ''kitchen stuff''
 Variable data = the contents of the box such as a ''cup''

Notice that you wouldn’t name the variable &lt;code&gt;box&lt;/code&gt;, as the relationship between the variable and the box is represented by the code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; and how the data is stored in memory. For example, a constant and array can be considered a type of variable when using the box analogy as they all are containers to hold some sort of contents, however, the difference is on how they are defined to handle the contents in the box.

'''&lt;code&gt;Variable&lt;/code&gt;''': a box that can be opened while in the storage shed to exchange the contents in the box.

'''&lt;code&gt;Constant&lt;/code&gt;''': a box that cannot be opened to exchange its contents. Its contents can only be viewed and not exchanged while inside the storage shed.

'''&lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;''': a box that contains one or more additional boxes in the main box. To complicate matters for beginners, each additional box may contain a box as well. In the kitchen stuff box we have two boxes, the clean cup box 
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$kitchen_stuff[&quot;clean_cup&quot;] = 'the clean cup'; 
&lt;/source&gt;
and the dirty cup box 
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$kitchen_stuff[&quot;dirty_cup&quot;] = 'the dirty cup';
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.php More on variables], from the PHP manual

===The print and echo statements===
'''Print''' is the key to output. It sends whatever is in the quotes (or parentheses) that follow it to the output device (browser window). A similar function is '''echo''', but print allows the user to check whether or not the print succeeded.

{{Code:Basic
|When used with quotation marks, as in:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

The quoted text is treated as if it were a string, and thus can be used in conjunction with the concatenation (joining two strings together) operator as well as any [[Programming:PHP:functions|function]] that returns a string value.

{{Code:Alt
|The following two examples have the same output.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|and
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;print &quot;Hello&quot; . &quot;, &quot; . &quot;World!&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

The dot symbol [[w:Concatenate|concatenates]] two strings. In other programming languages, concatenating a string is done with the plus symbol and the dot symbol is generally used to call functions from classes.

Also, it might be useful to note that under most conditions '''echo''' can be used interchangably with '''print'''. '''print''' returns a value, so it can be used to test, if the print succeeded, while '''echo''' assumes everything worked. Under most conditions there is nothing we can do, if '''echo''' fails.

{{Code:Alt
|The following examples have the same output again.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|and
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;echo &quot;Hello&quot; . &quot;, &quot; . &quot;World!&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;
|
}}

We will use '''echo''' in most sections of this book, since it is the more commonly used statement.

It should be noted that while '''echo''' and '''print''' can be called in the same way as functions, they are, in fact, language constructs, and can be called without the brackets. Normal functions (almost all others) must be called with brackets following the function identifier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Get Apache===
To get Apache, first you must go to [http://apache.org/ the Apache website]. From there, find the section for [http://httpd.apache.org/ the HTTP Server Project], and then the [http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi download page]. Unless you have an understanding of compiling an executable from the source code, be '''sure''' you download the binary (for Windows users, I recommend the [http://www.mirror.ac.uk/mirror/ftp.apache.org/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.52-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi latest (2.0.52)] MSI installer package).

Once you've obtained an Apache installer, whether an EXE or an MSI or what have you, run it. Apache will prompt you (eventually) for several (three) pieces of information. Following this are, very basically, your choices regarding what to input:
:'''Network Domain''': Either your domain name (.com/.net/.whatever) or your workgroup. If you are not sure if you have either, you probably don't; &quot;User&quot; is sufficient.
:'''Server Name''': I'm really not sure what to put here other than &quot;localhost&quot;, as that's the only server I have.
:'''Administrator's E-mail''': Your personal e-mail address. This is appended to default error messages and the like.

When given an option between running on when started and running as a service, I recommend using Apache as a service. This means that it will run when Windows begins, saving you the trouble of using the Start menu to start it every time you want to use it. To start Apache manually: Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Apache... &gt;  Control Apache Server &gt; Start Apache In Console.

''Note: you will also see some other options, like an option to stop Apache and an option to restart Apache. You will need to be able to control the server later. Alternatively, when I run Apache, I get an icon in the system tray next to the clock. I can right-click this icon and it has options to stop and restart the Apache server. This system tray icon should appear by default on the windows installation.

Once the install is finished, you'll have Apache installed. However, it's not yet configured. Before we do so, though, let's test Apache to see if the installation went according to plan. You should be able to now, if the server is started, run your preferred browser and type &quot;http://localhost/&quot; or, if your computer is on a network, the name of the computer (in my case &quot;http://dellpc/&quot;). You should see a page with the message &quot;If you can see this, it means that the installation of the Apache software on this system was successful.&quot; Congratulations!

===Configure Apache===
First, you must set up a location for your files to be stored. I created a folder in an easy to remember and easy to type location. All of my documents are stored in the folder &quot;C:/Web/&quot;. In this folder, I also included a shortcut to the httpd.conf document in the Apache folder for easy modification.

This httpd.conf document is located in the conf directory of where Apache is installed. On my computer this location is &quot;C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/conf/&quot;. Regardless of where it is, find it and open it before continuing.

This file is the primary (if not only) configuration file for your Apache server. The size and amount of words looks intimidating, but really most of them are comments; any line that begins with a hash mark / pound sign (#) is a comment. Find (using ctrl+f), &quot;DirectoryIndex&quot; and you will eventually see a line that reads &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var&lt;/tt&gt;. We are going to change that to read &lt;tt&gt;DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var index.php index.htm&lt;/tt&gt;. This means that if an index.html is not found in your web directory, the server will look for an index.php, and then will look for index.htm if index.php is not found. Go ahead and save the file. Fantastic. For the changes to take effect, you must restart the server.

To define where your web folder is, find (via ctrl+f) &quot;DocumentRoot&quot;. Replace what follows &quot;DocumentRoot&quot; in quotes with the full path to your web directory. If you're using C:/Web/ as your web directory, your line would read &lt;tt&gt;DocumentRoot &quot;C:/Web/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Scroll down a tad to find the comment line that reads &quot;This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.&quot; Change the following line to read &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;Directory &quot;C:/Web/&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or whatever you set DocumentRoot to.

===Testing Apache===
You should have a functioning Apache server now. You can test this by first restarting Apache, then placing an HTML file in your web directory named &quot;index.htm&quot; and then accessing it by opening your browser and browsing to http://localhost/. If you see your index.htm, excellent work.

''Note: for a while, I would see the Apache test page if I just went to http://localhost/ or http://dellpc/. To see my index page, I would have to go directly to that file, i.e. http://localhost/index.htm. Eventually, this just stopped happening. I'm not sure what happened.''

''This probabally happened because the Apache test page was cached. This means your web browser had stored a copy of it locally and was serving that file instead of the real webpage. Hitting refresh should fix this problem.''

Since Apache is configured and working, all that's left is to download, install, and configure PHP, and then reconfigure Apache to use it.

===Get PHP===
The [http://php.net/ PHP website] is the home of PHP on the web. There you can download PHP and also find the PHP manual. In any language, having a manual is a  '''huge''' help.

Navigate to the [http://php.net/downloads.php downloads page] and find the latest ZIP package. At the time of this writing, the current version is 4.3.9, and the ZIP package is [http://www.php.net/get/php-4.3.9-Win32.zip/from/a/mirror  here]. Unzip, via WinZip or WinRAR or PKUnzip or whatever decompressing program you use, to the root (C:/, usually) directory. It will leave a folder called &quot;php-...&quot;. Rename this folder to &quot;php&quot;, and it is in this C:/PHP/ directory that your new script interpreter now resides.

''Note: There is also an installer available for PHP, but I do not recommend this as using it shall lessen your knowledge of how PHP works.''

''PHP 5.0.2 is also available for download. This is a newer code base and generally has a greater performance, and more capabilities than then 4.x.x line. It is generally advised that you use the 5.x.x line in preference to 4.x.x. The code for PHP5 is very similar to the code for PHP4, and everything covered in this book should work under both environments.''

===Configure PHP===
In your C:/PHP/ directory, find the files  called &quot;php.ini-dist&quot; and &quot;php.ini-recommended&quot;. These are two separate files that are included with PHP that contain separate configurations for PHP depending on your needs. The PHP website recommends you use the recommended version, so you need to rename this to &quot;php.ini&quot;.

Here you have a choice. At this stage you need to make the file accessible to your webserver and the PHP parser. You can either:
* Simply move it to C:/WINDOWS/ and then make two shortcuts. One of these belongs in the C:/PHP/ directory and the other being in the web directory. This makes it easy to find while working with either PHP or the files in the web directory.
* Or (if you have Apache 2) make it available to Apache in its PHPIniDir directive in the &lt;tt&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/tt&gt; file. In order to do this, simply open &lt;tt&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/tt&gt;, scroll to the bottom and add one of these lines:
 # If you chose PHP 4 insert this:
 LoadModule php4_module &quot;c:/php/sapi/php4apache2.dll&quot;
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

 # If you chose PHP 5 insert this:
 LoadModule php5_module &quot;c:/php/php5apache2.dll&quot;
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

 # configure the path to php.ini
 PHPIniDir &quot;C:/php&quot;
: (remembering to change &lt;tt&gt;C:/php&lt;/tt&gt; if you put the PHP folder anywhere else)

*Additionally, if you would like Apache to colour highlight your PHP source files, add the following line directly below:
 AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

In php.ini, find &quot;doc_root&quot;. Much like you did with the Apache DocumentRoot directive, make the line read &lt;tt&gt;doc_root = &quot;c:\web&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; or whatever your web directory is. Scroll down a tad (or find) to reach the extension_dir line. After the equals sign, type, in quotes, the directory in which PHP is located. For people following along, this would be C:/PHP/. My extension_dir, for instance, reads &lt;tt&gt;extension_dir = &quot;c:\php&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

Finally, you need to make the relevant DLL's available to the web server. Again, there are a number of different ways of doing this. I recommend the final method because it will allow you to easier upgrade PHP in the future, should you choose to do so. The DLL's are &lt;tt&gt;php4ts.dll&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;php5ts.dll&lt;/tt&gt; depending on the version of PHP that you are installing.
* You can simply copy the DLL to the &lt;tt&gt;C:\Windows\&lt;/tt&gt; directory.
* Or to the web server's directory (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\bin&lt;/tt&gt;)
* Or you can add the PHP directory to the Windows PATH. There are different ways of doing this depending on your version of Windows:
** In Windows 98/Me you need to edit autoexec.bat:
*** Look through the file until you find an entry with &lt;tt&gt;PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM...&lt;/tt&gt; etc. Simply append &lt;tt&gt;'';C:\PHP''&lt;/tt&gt; to the end of it.
*** Save the file (make sure that you make a backup first) and restart your computer.
** On Windows NT/2000/XP and Server 2003, you need to change the PATH in the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/tt&gt; pane.
*** Open the System panel from the Control Panel.
*** Click on the Advanced tab, click on the button to open the &quot;environment variables&quot;. Look in the pane for System Variables.
*** Find the PATH entry and double-click on it. Add &quot;'';C:\PHP''&quot; to the end of the line.
*** Click OK and restart your computer.

{{technique}}

'''Grilling is a fast, dry method of cookery which uses the intense heat radiated by an:'''

* electrical element, 
* gas flame, 
* glowing charcoal or an open wood fire. 

The heat source can be either above or below the food (or both) and the heat, in the form of infra-red waves, is transferred to the surface of the food. Infra-red waves penetrate only about 1 mm into food (whereas microwave radiation penetrates about 40 mm/l½ in.)

Heat is transferred from the surface to the centre of the food by conduction. (If the food comes into contact with hot grill bars, which is almost certain to happen, there is also some conduction at the surface.)

It is important that the grill is preheated so that it reaches the high temperatures necessary for efficient infra-red radiation.

'''Grilling cooks fast because:'''

* very high temperatures are used
* the food can be positioned close to the heat source
* the energy passes from the heat source almost instantly, without having to be carried in a liquid or through much air.

How much heat the food absorbs depends on the colour of its surface: darker foods tend to absorb the infra-red more easily than light ones (which reflect some of the heat). This is the same effect as a black car getting hotter in the sun than a white car (or why a person in a white shirt stays cooler in the hot sun in the summer than the same person would wearing a black shirt.)

===Grilling and radiant heat===

When you put your hand near a hotplate or a room radiator or in direct sunlight the glow you feel is the result of infra-red heat radiation.

Infra-red radiation works without any physical contact between the source of heat and the object, but the energy is lost quickly because the rays spread out in all directions, so during cooking the object needs to be quite near the heat source.

The food is placed at a distance from the heat source which will brown the surface as required, while cooking the centre to the degree of doneness required. The best temperature for meat is in the range 150°-200°C (300°-390°F) at a distance of 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in.) from a typical overhead grill (which will be at a much higher temperature -around 1,000°C or 1,800°F).

===Browning===

Browning cannot occur at low temperatures, which is why food that is cooked at boiling point (as in steaming and microwaving) does not brown. 
When the food is exposed to the radiant heat of a grill, the surface rapidly browns and develops an intense, full flavour.
In foods with a high sugar content, the sugar caramelises, first melting and then deepening in colour, and also creating a rich flavour (this is the same mechanism as the browning of [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]].

In foods such as cakes, meats, nuts and coffee beans, the carbohydrate part of the food reacts with other parts of it and the result is browning. This is sometimes called the Maillard reaction after the Frenchman who discovered how it happened.

With meats, the browning stage is sometimes called searing. It used to be thought that searing actually sealed the surface of the meat, but this is not the case.

===How to control the degree of cooking===

In grilling, the radiated heat is very intense and the surfaces of the food brown rapidly. But there is a big difference between the speed of cooking at the surface and inside the food, and it is important that surface browning occurs at about the same rate as the internal cooking. 

In an overhead grill this means adjusting the distance of the food from the heat source and in a charcoal grill you might need to move the food to a cooler area after initial browning. 

Otherwise it is easy to end up with food that is either charred on the outside and under-cooked or even quite cold on the inside or completely dried out, tough (even tender meat will toughen in these conditions) and burnt.

 
===Choice of food for grilling===

Only certain types of food are suitable for the intense dry heat of grilling. 

In general they should be tender items which are:

* of good quality
* small (large joints of meat must be cut into thin slices or steaks)
* regular in shape to ensure even cooking.

Meat should have a reasonable fat content - veal escalopes, for example, are so lean that they will just dry out. 

Tough cuts of meat are unsuitable for grilling, because the temperatures are too high, the conditions too dry and the time too short for the connective tissue to be converted into gelatin.

Tomatoes and mushrooms grill successfully, particularly if they are first brushed with oil, but vegetables with a low moisture content will rapidly dry out and shrivel.

== Other meanings of the term ==
'''Grilling''' is also an ambiguous term that can mean:

===Double-sided [[Cookbook:Frying|Frying]]===
This would be done in a sandwich cooking device, similar to a [[Cookbook:Waffle Iron|waffle iron]] but preferably without the square bumps. The [[w:George_Foreman_Grill|George Foreman Grill]] works fairly well. The procedure is sometimes also known as toasting, as in the [[Cookbook:Toasted Cheese Sandwich|toasted cheese sandwich]].

===[[Cookbook:Broiling|Broiling]] (British English usage)===
Most British and European ovens are fitted with radiant grills: an overhead gas or electric radiant heating element cooks the food below, which lies on a &quot;grill&quot; or rack (the grill usually rests in a tray that catches drips from the food). The same term is also used to describe the cooking technique where food lying on a rack is cooked by radiant heat from below, as in a barbecue.

If no radiant grill is fitted, this is best done in an electric [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], with the door partly open and only the top heating element in use. Gas ovens often provide a less-effective lower drawer for this purpose.

The same can be achieved outdoors by vertical grilling, using either stacks of charcoals or fires with high flames fed by standing pieces of thin and long burning-wood. The food will then be placed to receive infrared radiation from the side.

===[[Cookbook:Barbecuing|Barbecuing]]===
This cooking method uses fire. It is usually done outdoors on barbecue grills over wood, charcoal, or propane fires. In some areas, the term '''barbecuing''' is reserved for a slow low-heat cooking process that operates at about [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|220°F (105°C)]] and the term '''grilling''' is used for a fast high-heat cooking process. In other areas, all barbecuing is considered grilling and all grilling over a fire is considered barbecuing. Barbecuing is traditionally done with hardwoods or fruitwoods, such as hickory, maple, mesquite, and applewood, which gives a nice smoke flavor to the food.

The [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], fish or vegetables may be prepared by [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinating]] or by applying a combination of [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] known as a [[Cookbook:Dry Rub|dry rub]].  Marinated meats can also be ‘mopped’ with the marinade while cooking. A [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]] may be added before, during, or after cooking.

Barbecue also can mean a device for cooking such food, a social event at which such food is served, or any food served with barbecue sauce.

== Edit war ==

OK, the anonymous IP had asked me to look this over... I'm not going to argue over which terms mean which because I don't know, although I must say which meanings are most common should be considered the &quot;correct&quot; meanings with the others still being noted to avoid confusion. Two sources (Wikipedia and Merriam-Webster) are not really enough to judge that unless they contain that info. There must be a way for you two to come into agreement without an admin putting his foot down.

I do see that [[User:AlbertCahalan]] seems to have his own idea of what the page should be like and until now was reverting anything to the contrary. I don't see why this should be done; what's wrong with expanding it? This is a wiki. We don't own pages. If somebody wants to expand them, let them, or if you insist on not doing so, at least point out why it's better not to (&quot;this is a disambiguation page&quot; does not cut it). Now, I'm not saying I'm on anybody's side as far as the edit war goes, I'm just saying useful content should not be reverted for no apparent reason -- and certainly not while calling the contributing party a vandal, at that! - [[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 20:13, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

:I think the main issue was over whether the cooking method is &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot;. I'm not sure how to make that distinction (how direct is direct; is microwave the only direct way?), but it doesn't matter in any case. So, best not to mention it. I'm not 100% sure what you mean by useful content being reverted, but the barbeque instructions were written by me and originally placed on the barbeque page. They belong there, not on the grilling page. Given that little is said about the distance from the flame, the instructions should suit either the normal barbeque definition or the strange narrow definition. I pointed out more info on the user's talk page. I think there is much less for him to object to now, ever since the removal of the useless direct/indirect distinction. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:23, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

::Ah, I didn't notice that content was moved rather than added, sorry. Still, I don't think it was worth an edit war. I do agree that &quot;direct&quot; versus &quot;indirect&quot; doesn't seem to be a useful distinction and we're probably better off without it. No comment on where things belong, though. - [[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 23:04, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I'd be happy to hear any suggestions for better ways to deal with someone who insists on a very non-standard definition of barbecue while making the Cookbook:Grilling page too wordy to serve as a disambiguation page. Note that I did attempt to discuss things on &quot;his&quot; anon talk page. When that fails...? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:18, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

Is the Wikipedia entry non-standard?  I don't understand how one part of Wiki can say one thing and yet when I try to apply it into another part, its wrong.  Read the Joy of Cooking.  Read any barbecue cookbook.  Read about Mexican history (barbacoa).  Go to a barbecue competition or restaurant.  And Albert did not try to discuss anything with me, he only accused me of being wrong.  I've conceded that barbecue can be taken to mean grilling, but to professional cooks and purists it means something else entirely.  The biggest problem with the original page is it confuses both definations.  If you mean barbecuing as in grillign high heat/fast cooking then delete the the 'popular in the Southern US' as this is popular the world over but if you mean barbecue as in ribs etc, then its slow cooked which necessarily requires indirect heat.  I hope my latest attempt shows that I am willing to compromise AND that I really know what I'm talking about. [[User_talk:207.171.167.101| 207.171.167.101]] 07:44, 16 May 2005

:Yes, the wikipedia entry is non-standard. I'm working to get it fixed. In any case, &quot;grilling&quot; means at least 3 different kinds of cooking. (double-sided frying, broiling, and all types of barbeque) So the grilling page needs to cover that. In general, it can direct readers elsewhere: [[Cookbook:Frying]], [[Cookbook:Broiling]], and [[Cookbook:Barbecuing]]. So I do insist that this page do that. I also insist that the barbeque instructions not disappear or get moved over here, but I might accept moving them to a different page. (they are somewhat specific to making beef burgers on a wood fire) '''DO NOT MOVE VIA CUT-AND-PASTE.''' Suggest a good name, and I'll move the instructions. All cooking uses indirect heat, except perhaps microwave (where the heat is generated in the food), so let's avoid that useless distinction. If you allow more than microwaving to be considered direct, then all forms of grilling and/or barbecuing are direct. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:25, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

:Your barbecue/grilling distinction fails because there is no place to draw the line. What would you call what I do with burgers? For brief moments, they may be in the flames. (&quot;Grilling!&quot; you may think) Often though, there are no flames at all and the burgers are bathed in smoke. They even get the reddish tint from carbon monoxide, just as is claimed by the &quot;barbecue purists&quot;. So is it barbecuing then? Both? I have no trouble describing this, because I use the normal definition of barbecue. No matter what I do with the fire I'm barbecuing, which is a type of grilling. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:27, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

:Please sign posts in the future, using 4 tilde (squiggle, likely near your &quot;1&quot; key) characters. To you, it should look like &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; before you save the page. (you can see the result in the preview though) I signed your text for you; you should take care of it yourself. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:27, 16 May 2005 (UTC)

Great job being an idiot. If you acutally knew what slow barbecuing is (which by your burger analogy you obviously don't), then you would not mistake burgers on a gas grill for ribs and pork on a pit over slow-burning wood. Once again, grilling is the general cooking of meat with open flame, while barbecue is specifically cooking food over a slow-burning flame for a long period of time. [[User:Haverton|Haverton]] 20:59, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

:Great job having a polite debate. I certainly don't use a gas grill; I cook over real chunks of mesquite wood. Sometimes they burn very slowly, with no flame and maybe lots of smoke, and sometimes they have flames. Outside your neck of the woods, barbecuing is normally fast and it is always considered a type of grilling. It might even involve a gas barbeque. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:38, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

== As a chef ==

Grilling to me is controlling the Mallard Reaction using direct heat. Even throwing a tortilla on an electric burner is grilling to me. --[[User:68.127.162.10|68.127.162.10]] 02:47, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">GNOME was started in late 1997 due to unhappiness over licensing problems with KDE. In 1999 the first version was released. 

In late 2001 the main focus switched to usability and GNOME 2.0 was released in June 2002. Gnome 2.6, was released in March 2004. Releases occur every six months. The current release is 2.30.

If you are used to '''Windows XP''', here are the differences you find.

==Taskbar==
In GNOME, the taskbar is called the Panel, and there are two of them by default. The task listing is on the bottom panel, as is the virtual desktop pager. The system tray (the clock and its tiny icon friends) and &quot;Quick Launch&quot; (which is disabled in XP by default) are on the top, along with the starting menus.

==Start Menu==
There is no start menu in GNOME; in fact, there are three different menus: Applications, Places, and System. Each are on the top panel

==My Documents==
GNOME uses a place called &quot;Home Folder&quot;. You will find it on the Places menu. It is also personalised to your user name. For example, if your user name is &quot;Abhi&quot;, the folder will appear as &quot;Abhi's Home&quot; on the desktop.

==My Computer==
This is an area where GNOME is very similar. It is simply known as &quot;Computer&quot;, omitting &quot;My&quot;. Available drives for storing files will be shown. Note that there are no &quot;drive letters&quot; (such as A: or C:) used in GNOME, instead drives are given more logical names (such as Floppy and USB CD-RW Drive). &quot;Filesystem&quot; is the root directory, which is the parent of everything.

==My Network Places==
Access to network resources can be done by choosing &quot;Network&quot; from inside the Places menu.

==Control Panel==
GNOME does not have a Control Panel, instead there is a menu called &quot;Preferences&quot; in the System menu, for changing user options (such as themes and wallpapers), and there is a menu called &quot;Administration&quot; for changing the system's configuration.

==Recycle Bin==
GNOME does not call it Recycle Bin. It calls it &quot;Trash&quot; or &quot;Wastebasket&quot;, depending on the localisation. It functions similarly though. By default, all files must go into the Wastebasket before they can be deleted, although there is an option to delete on the spot. It is located on the bottom panel, instead of the desktop.

==Windows Explorer/File Manager==
The file manager (Nautilus) is GNOME's equivalent to Windows Explorer. From GNOME version 2.26, there's tabs feature in Nautilus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Microsoft Windows===
First you need to get an OpenOffice installer package. Before downloading the Office Package, you'll need to review the [http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/sys_reqs.html system requirement]. After you read it, download an appropriate [http://download.openoffice.org/index.html installation package] or use [http://distribution.openoffice.org/p2p/ P2P download] or [http://distribution.openoffice.org/cdrom/ order a CD-ROM]. You might want to use a [[w:en:Comparison_of_download_managers | download manager]] if you're using direct download.

For some functionality to work, OpenOffice need [[w:en:JRE|Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]] to be installed on the computer. If you're not sure you do have JRE installed, you could include JRE in your OpenOffice package.

Installation of both the JRE and OpenOffice.org is as simple as following a fairly standard installation routine in Windows. The installation wizard first explains that it will allow you to install OpenOffice.org.  After you click on &quot;Next&quot;, it prompts you to read and accept the terms of service.  Clicking next again allows you to choose a directory in which to install the software.  You are then offered a choice between full installation of all features and a screen which would allow you to choose which components to install.  After this point, the installation wizard runs for a time, with several progress bars and a running list of which file is being copied.

You can now open OpenOffice.org from the task bar (if you set up quickstarter during install) or its program group.  From the program group you then select the tool you need.  To use quickstarter right-click on it and select the tool you need.

===GNU/Linux===
Most GNU/Linux distributions come with OpenOffice.org preinstalled. It is simply necessary to choose the appropriate option for installation. Be aware, however, that some of the packaged files, such as RPMs, do not include some features that conflict with the distro licenses, as they are packaged by the distributors. Java support is one item frequently left out of these versions. However, some distributions configure it to run with an alternative free software Java Runtime Environment from the Free Software Foundation.

It can be installed in RPM or DEB form manually by navigating to the same download page as for installing under Windows, and selecting the operating system as Linux after choosing the language, then choosing whether you want to download an RPM (For Red Hat, Fedora Core, SUSE, Mandriva, etc.) or DEB (for Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) file. This can then be installed with the package manager provided with your distribution.

OpenOffice.org can also be downloaded in source code form by choosing 'Source and Solver' from the main download page, but this isn't necessary for most users not interested in development.

==== Debian and Derivatives ====

Debian and and its derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu) uses apt-get, aptitude, and synaptic as their package manager. You can install OpenOffice.Org by running either of these in the Terminal:

&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install openoffice.org&lt;/code&gt;

or

&lt;code&gt;sudo aptitude install openoffice.org&lt;/code&gt;

or by using the graphical package manager.

===Mac OS X===

In order to run OpenOffice.org on MAC OS X, X11 is required. MAC OS X versions before Tiger (10.4.x) required a separate application to be downloaded from Apple. With Tiger X11 is available on the OS X Install Disk. You can find this in the System/Installation/packages/ folder called X11User.pkg - run this package to install X11.

There are community builds of Universal Binary OpenOffice.org for Intel based Macs; however the PPC versions will run in Rosetta anyway and are QA'd which the Intel builds are not at the time of writing. Once X11 is installed on the machine downloading and installing OpenOffice is like any other MAC application.

Go to the [http://www.openoffice.org/ Openoffice.org] web site and follow the instructions to download the application. Once this has finished, double click the &quot;OOo_2.0.1_MacOSX_install_en-US.dmg&quot; or (&quot;OOo_2.0.3rc3_MacOSXIntel_en-US.dmg&quot;) package and then drag the OpenOffice.org Icon to your applications folder.  

When the copying process has finished you can click the eject button in the finder and the dmg package can be deleted.

Click the OpenOffice.org icon to run the application, optionally register and you're ready to go.

===Solaris===
:''Instructions for installing OpenOffice.org in Solaris?''

for now, see http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Administration_Guide/Solaris

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you turn on your computer, you see the operating system load.  Once the system has started, the computer will open the GNOME user interface.  GNOME runs atop the operating system and provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the user to interact with.  The login screen is the first screen a user will see when GNOME starts.

==Types of login screen==
There are two types of login screen, standard and graphical.  GNOME allows the users to select a login theme to customize their machine.  Different operating systems provide different &quot;preferred&quot; graphical themes.

Some login themes include a &quot;face browser&quot;, which lets the user visually select their user name, while others simply provide text boxes to enter a user name and password.

The graphical login screen often provides controls for shutting down or restarting the computer, and for configuring the login theme.

(need screenshots)

GNOME requires you to enter your user name and password on the login screen. Either type in your user name in the box, or double-click your face. Then type in your password and press the enter key. If you entered you password correctly, GNOME will display a welcome screen and open the main desktop.

==Nested login==
Nested login lets you log in as another user without having to log out first. It displays their desktop in a Application Window rather than taking the whole screen.

==Secondary login==

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you do not have  GNOME installed on your system, then there are many ways to install it

==With a Linux distribution==
Many Linux distributions offer GNOME as part of their package selections. Please check the documentation of your distro to see if GNOME is an available desktop enviroment.

===Distribution specific help===
*In Debian type &quot;apt-get install gnome&quot;
*In Ubuntu type &quot;apt-get install gnome gdm&quot;
*In Mandriva (formarly Mandrake Linux) select GNOME workstation from the installer.
*In Gentoo type &quot;emerge gnome&quot;
*In ArchLinux type &quot;pacman -S gnome&quot;
*In FreeBSD type &quot;pkg_add -r gnome2&quot;
: '''Installation on any distro will most likely require root access.'''

==Garnome==
[http://www.gnome.org/projects/garnome/ Garnome] is a script that lets you compile GNOME.

==Live CD==
If you want to try GNOME without installing, try a live CD that uses it such as [http://www.gnoppix.org/ Gnoppix], [http://www.morphix.org Gnome Morphix] and [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu Linux]. If you want to easily compare GNOME and [[Using KDE|KDE]], try a [http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora.html Fedora] LiveCD - you can select which desktop to use at login time.

==Other Operating systems==
Sun Microsystems' Solaris offer GNOME
BSD's can install it via ports or pkg-src. Just find the GNOME directory and type make install.

      <comment>added paragraph on analysis of knowledge</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The word 'epistemology' comes to us from ancient Greek: the noun &lt;i&gt;episteme&lt;/i&gt; meaning 'knowledge' and the suffix &lt;i&gt;-ology&lt;/i&gt; meaning 'the science of' or 'the study of.'  So, literally speaking, epistemology is the study or investigation of knowledge itself.  It is also often referred to as ''Theory of Knowledge.''  Epistemic knowledge is not about what we know, but about what it means to ''know''.

Epistemology seeks to answer basic questions about how human beings perceive the world and gain knowledge about it.  The more prominent of these include:
# Is there an external world?  How can we be certain?
# How does memory work?  How can we know that our memories are genuine?
# What is the nature of perception?  To what extent does current knowledge affect future perception?
# What knowledge is inherent to humans and what is learned after birth?  Can new facts be assimilated without innate concepts?
# To what extent are inferences based on perceptions valid?  What is the proper way to make such inferences?

It is helpful to note the basic (Socratic) distinction made between beliefs, which hold to opinions, and knowledge, which holds to 'truth'. Knowledge concerns apodictic facts that are absolute and simply cannot be false (while opinions can be and often are false). According to [[w:Karl Popper|Karl Popper]], the only way we can distinguish between truth and not-truth is by subjecting test-statements to experimental invalidation. [[w:Plato|Plato]] thought otherwise; he believed that truth is not subject to invalidation.
 
So then the epistemological question: Where does our knowledge come from? And to take it further (as many philosophers have): What are the limits of human knowledge? Here one should read up on the two main competing philosophical branches of the early modern age: [[w:Rationalism|Rationalism]] and [[w:Empiricism|Empiricism]]. Rationalist thinkers like [[w:Descartes|Descartes]] argue that all knowledge comes from reason, and everything in the world of homo cogitans is fundamentally rational. It is through the human mind that the human knows. Empiricists (at that point, the British thinkers: [[w:Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[w:Hume|Hume]], [[w:Locke|Locke]]) insist that most, if not all, *real* human knowledge can only be arrived at through human experience. It is through the human senses that the human knows.

There is also the theologically-driven idea of knowledge as (divine) revelation (think God,by his Spirit, giving to the writers the Holy Bible). There is an interesting blurring of the lines separating belief and knowledge here. [[w:St. Augustine|St. Augustine]] gives us an eloquent discussion of reason vs. faith.

One issue that is of interest to many epistemologists is the analysis of knowledge, that is trying to find an answer to the question &quot;what conditions need to be satisfied to say that someone knows something?&quot; For a long time, the conditions seemed clear to most philosophers: to know something, you must believe it, it has to be true and you have to have a justification for believing it. The problems raised by the [[w:Gettier problem|Gettier problem]] have reopened this question for many and a great number of new problems have arisen. This kind of question is considered the most general of questions in epistemology, while concerns about, say, the different ways of knowing are a much more specific set of questions within epistemology.

''We should make sure that types of markings for all the types of resistors, caps, ICs, and everything else are thoroughly explained.  This is not terribly important to engineers, who are more concerned with theory and just pull them out of a labeled box.  But to the hobbyist this is pretty important, and also difficult to learn, because there are so many nonintuitive ways to label things.''

(ohms, picofarads, microhenries)  &quot;The color-digit pairs used in the resistor example below are standard, but the tolerance and higher multiplier values are for resistors only.&quot;''

== Resistors ==


=== Identifying resistors ===

Most axial resistors use a pattern of colored stripes to indicate resistance. SMT ones follow a numerical pattern.  Cases are usually brown, blue, or green, though other colors are occasionally found like dark red or dark gray.

=== 4-band axial resistors ===

Four band identification is the most commonly used color coding scheme on all resistors. It consists of four colored bands that are painted around the body of the resistor. The scheme is simple: The first two numbers are the first two significant digits of the resistance value, the third is a multiplier, and the fourth is the tolerance of the value. Each color corresponds to a certain number, shown in the chart below.  The tolerance for a 4-band resistor will be 2%, 5%, or 10%

|None      ||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;           ||±20% (M)  ||&amp;nbsp;

For example, if you are looking for a 12K (12000 ohm) resistor with ±5% tolerance, you would be looking for a Brown (1) Red (2) Orange (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) Gold (±5%) resistor.

12&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ohm = 12000 Ω = 12 kΩ

Note that red to violet are the colors of the rainbow where red is low energy and violet is higher energy.  Resistors use specific values, which are determined by their tolerance.  These values repeat for every exponent, 6.8, 68, 680.  This is useful because the digits, and hence the first two or three stripes, will always be similar patterns of colors, which you will learn to recognize without checking a chart.  To help you remember them, the standard values for 10% resistors are:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!bgcolor = &quot;#B8860B&quot;|1!!bgcolor = &quot;#000000&quot;|&lt;font color = &quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;0&lt;/font&gt;

|-
!bgcolor = &quot;#A0A0A0&quot;|8!!bgcolor = &quot;#FF0000&quot;|2
|}

=== 5-band axial resistors ===

5-band identification is used for higher precision (lower tolerance) resistors (1%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1%), to notate the extra digit.  The first three bands represent the significant digits, the fourth is the multiplier, and the fifth is the tolerance.

=== SMD/SMT resistors ===

SMD (surface mounted device) or SMT (surface mount technology; same thing) resistors are found mostly on devices where large scale integration is present. They generally use an alphanumeric numbering system.  

[[Image:Register3.jpg|150px]]

For surface mount resistors, a numerical code is used.  For 10% tolerance resistors, 3 numbers are used, for 1% resistors, 4 digits are used.  The scheme is similar to color codes, in that the first two or three digits are the significant digits, and the last digit is the multiplier (expressed as an exponent of 10).  This is easy to remember as &quot;the first digits then as many zeros as the last digit after it&quot; ohms.  &quot;683&quot; for instance, represents 68 with three zeros after it: 68 000 = 68 kΩ.  Likewise, &quot;4991&quot; represents 499 with 1 zero after it: 499 0 = 4.99 kΩ.

For small resistance values, an alternate notation is often used. For these, an R is used in place of the decimal. For example, 5R6 = 5.6 Ω.

They are the smallest class of discrete resistors available.

=== Large resistors ===

For large power resistors and potentiometers, the value is usually written out explicitly as &quot;10 k&amp;Omega;&quot;, for instance.

=== Examples ===

[[Image:Resistors_axial.jpg]]

In the top example, the colors are [http://www.okaphone.nl/calc/resistor.shtml?ohm=10k&amp;tol=5 brown (1) - black (0) - orange (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) - gold (5%)]. This means 1 0 &amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega; ± 5% = 10 ± 0.5 kΩ.  This resistor has a value anywhere from 9.5 to 10.5 kΩ

The second example has 5 stripes.  They are [http://www.okaphone.nl/calc/resistor.shtml?ohm=10k&amp;tol=1 brown (1) - black (0) - black (0) - red (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) - brown (1%)].  This means 1 0 0 &amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega; ± 1% = 10 ± 0.1 kΩ.  This resistor then has a value anywhere from 9.9 to 10.1 kΩ.

Note that these are both 10 kΩ.

The third example is a larger power resistor, and is labeled [http://www.okaphone.nl/calc/resistor.shtml?ohm=56&amp;tol=5 green (5) - blue (6) - black (&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) - gold (5%)].  This means 5 6 &amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega; ± 5% = 56 ± 2.8 Ω.  This resistor then has a value anywhere from 53.2 to 58.8 Ω.  It has a higher power rating than the others, which is not labeled, but is obvious from its larger size.

== Capacitors ==

[[Image:Capacitors electrolytic.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Axial (top) and radial (bottom) electrolytic capacitors]]

=== Electrolytic capacitors ===

Axial electrolytic capacitors are electrolytic capacitors that have connections on both ends. These are most frequently used in devices where there is no space for vertically mounted capacitors. See photograph above.

The arrowed stripe indicates the polarity, with the arrows pointing towards the negative pin. '''Warning:''' connecting electrolytic capacitors in reverse polarity can easily damage or destroy the capacitor.  Most large electrolytic capacitors have the voltage, capacitance, temperature ratings, and company name written on them without having any special color coding schemes. Most electrolytic capacitors in general have light blue, black, dark purple or brown colors, although some specialized ones come in yellow and other colors. If for some reason you are uncertain about the polarity, the can is always the negative connection. Most axial caps have both ends visible. The positive end has a rubber insulation and the negative side is only aluminium.



Radial electrolytic capacitors are like axial electrolytic ones, except both pins come out the same end. Usually that end (the &quot;bottom end&quot;) is mounted flat against the PCB and the capacitor rises perpendicular to the PCB it is mounted on. This type of capacitor probably accounts for at least 70% of capacitors in consumer electronics (that don't use SMT components). See photograph above.

Like their axial counterparts, many radial electrolytic capacitors have the voltage, capacitance, temperature ratings, polarity, and company name directly written on them without having any special color coding schemes.'''

=== Tantalum capacitors ===

Tantalum capacitors are useful due to their low leakage current, reliability, and their ability to keep stable capacitance over a wide range of temperatures. below is a diagram:


They have special markings. The stripe on the side indicates polarity. Usually with a store bought component, the longer lead is positive. '''Warning:''' connecting tantalum capacitors in reverse polarity can easily damage or destroy the capacitor. Generally it will have the capacitance written in &amp;micro;F, and the working voltage below it. In some cases (often when &amp;micro;F is not printed), the value (in pF) is encoded with three numbers; the first two digits being the significant figures, with the third being the multiplier (i.e. number of zeros). Tantalum capacitors are most commonly dipped and have a shiny coating, as well as vary in color, being yellow, red, and sometimes blue. Most '''axial''' tantalum capacitors look completely different.

The dark line on the SMT variety is the positive terminal.  The dipped axial through-hole variety will be marked with a + or a dark line to indicate the positive terminal.

=== Ceramic capacitors ===

Ceramic capacitors are generally non-polarized and almost as common as radial electrolytic capacitors.

[[Image:Condensador ceramico.jpg|80px]]

Generally, they use an alphanumeric marking system.  The number part is the same as for SMT resistors, except that the value represented is in pF.  They may also be written out directly, for instance, 2n2 = 2.2 nF.  For capacitors the tolerance code is:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!Tolerance Code!!Tolerance
|-
|A ||± 0.05 pF
|-
|B ||± 0.1 pF
|-
|C ||± 0.25 pF
|-
|D ||± 0.5 pF
|-
|E ||± 0.5%
|-
|F ||± 1%
|-
|G ||± 2%
|-
|H ||± 3%
|-
|J ||± 5%
|-
|K ||± 10%
|-
|L*||± 15%
|-
|M ||± 20%
|-
|N*||± 30%
|-
|P*||−0% +100%
|-
|S*||−20% +50%
|-
|W*||−0% +200%
|-
|X*||−20% +40%
|-
|Z ||−20% +80%
|}

letters with * are not used consistently.

''how similar is this to resistors?''

For example, .047K = .047 µF 10%.

The dielectric material is sometimes designated by another code:
(note: the materials in the table below are not ceramic capacitors as implied, but plastic and paper)
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
!Marking ||Material
|-
|KT      ||Polyester Film / Foil
|-
|MKT     ||Metallized Polyester (PETP)
|-
|KC      ||Polycarbonate Film / Foil
|-
|MKC     ||Metallized Polycarbonate
|-
|KS      ||Polystyrene Film / Foil
|-
|KPS     ||foil/pps?
|-
|MPS     ||Metallized pps
|-
|KP      ||Polypropylene Film / Foil
|-
|MKP     ||Metallized Polypropylene
|-
|MP      ||Metallized paper
|}

Please note that the table above is valid most of the time but not always because it is not a real standard. To be real sure you may check the data sheet from the manufacturer in mind.

The cap color can also indicate the dielectric:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet Red/Orange Orange/Orange Yellow/Orange Green/Orange Blue/Orange Red/Violet
C0G/NP0 N030 N080 N150 N220 N330 N470 N750 N1000 N1500 N2200 N3300 N4700 P100
|}

==== Axial ceramic capacitors ====

These often have a yellow body, and use the same color band system as resistors, except that the value indicated is in pF.

=== Multilayer Ceramic capacitors ===

[[Image:Multilayerceramic png1.PNG]]

These usually use the same alphanumeric system.

=== SMD/SMT capacitors ===

These are often not even labeled.  If they are labeled, it is the same system as SMT resistors, but representing pF.  Polarized capacitors are marked with a stripe on the ''positive'' end of the package, though some electrolytic SMT capacitors are marked on the ''negative'' end of the package. They are rectangular, and often black or tan colored.  The black capacitors are easily mistaken for diodes due to the white stripe on one end...

== Inductors ==


Sometimes the value of an inductor is printed directly on it.  If no units are given, µH can be assumed.  If it looks like the system used by SMT resistors, it is probably that system, except that the value represented is in µH.  Inductors as a class of components are current and magnetic sensitive devices. Inductors work by creating a magnetic field around the windings. The current of a electron flow causes energy to transfer into the field. Similarly, if there is a no current but a field present, coiled wiring responds by creating a current in the wiring. This is the original source of the name Inductor, it induces a current when exposed to a field, or a field when exposed to a current. 

=== Axial inductors ===

If an inductor uses the color code system, the value represented is in µH.  Expect to see a wide silver or gold band before the normal colored bands, and a thin tolerance band at the end.
but have some more information that is not given. Identified on PCB assemblies with the letter designation of L, the last letter in the word coil.

SMT/SMD Diodes are marked with a stripe on the cathode side of the part.

==Summation convention==

If we label the axes as 1,2, and 3 we can write the dot product as a sum

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^3 u_i v_i &lt;/math&gt;

If we number the elements of a matrix similarly,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=
\begin{pmatrix}A_{11} &amp; A_{12} &amp; A_{13}\\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} &amp; A_{23} 
\\A_{31} &amp; A_{32} &amp; A_{33} \end{pmatrix} \quad 
\mathbf{B}= \begin{pmatrix} B_{11} &amp; B_{12} &amp; B_{13}\\ B_{21} &amp; B_{22} &amp; B_{23} \\B_{31} &amp; B_{32} &amp; B_{33} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

we can write similar expressions for matrix multiplications

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u})_i=\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{ij} u_j \quad
 (\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B})_{ik}=\sum_{j=1}^3 A_{ij} B_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that in each case we are summing over the repeated index. Since this is so common, it is now conventional to omit the summation sign.

Instead we simply write
 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} =  u_i v_i \quad
(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{u})_i= A_{ij} u_j \quad 
(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B})_{ik}= A_{ij} B_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;

We can then  also number the unit vectors, '''ê'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and write

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=u_i \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i &lt;/math&gt;

which can be convenient in a rotating coordinate system.

==Kronecker delta==

The Kronecker delta is 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}=
\left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; i=j\\ 0 &amp; i\ne j \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the standard way of writing the identity matrix. 

==Levi-Civita (Alternating) symbol==

Another useful quantity can be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}=
\left\{ \begin{matrix} 
1 &amp; (i,j,k)= (1,2,3) \mbox{ or } (2,3,1) \mbox{ or } (3,1,2) \\
-1 &amp; (i,j,k)= (2,1,3) \mbox{ or } (3,2,1) \mbox{ or } (1,3,2) \\
 0 &amp; \mbox{ otherwise } \end{matrix} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

With this definition it turns out that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \epsilon_{ijk}  \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i u_j v_k
&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}\epsilon_{ipq}=
\delta_{jp}\delta_{kq}-\delta_{jq}\delta_{kp} \,&lt;/math&gt;

This will let us write many formulae more compactly.</text>

XML stands for &quot;Extensible Markup Language&quot;, not &quot;eXtensible Markup Language&quot;. You can consult the W3C site to verify.

Many of the examples in the book use tables to put line numbers to the left of code.  The numbers do not line up properly with the lines of code in my browser, however (Mozilla).  Might I suggest either leaving off the line numbers or including them inline, like I've done in the SVG chapter?  I guess a better situation would be if the wiki software could automatically insert line numbers.  I realise that the reason for putting the line numbers in a separate table cell is to avoid them being copied to the clipboard if the code is selected.

I thought one way might be to use an &amp;lt;ol&gt; to automatically number the lines, but it seems that Mozilla will copy the numbers to the clipboard too.

I've just popped over here from the Wikipedia XML page. Can someone explain to me:
:* What is the goal, or focus, of this book? Is it basic tutorial? A reference manual? Guidance on advanced techniques?

:I agree yeah. Basically the problem is this book has a section [[/Introduction to XML]], but no section called [[/Introduction]]. How about it? -- [[wikipedia:User:Nojer2|Harry Wood]] - 10:28, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

== subchapters ==
I'm a little surprised to find &quot;CSS&quot; and &quot;style sheets&quot; as separate subchapters. IMHO it'd be better to understand when having the tweo subchapters &quot;CSS style sheets&quot; and &quot;XSL style sheets and transformations&quot;. 
BTW why is CSS itself explained (it's not a language defined by XML) instead of the ''use'' of CSS within XML? (the &quot;Learning objectives&quot; lists &quot;know how to implement and use CSS on a XML document&quot; but there is mainly CSS for HTML but very few for XML in general) I don't get the point...but maybe there was a discussion earlier :) then please insert the power points into the introduction.

== Naming convention ==

Current book naming convention is depreciated. I suggest changing it to [[Wikibooks:Naming policy#The slash convention|slash convention]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 16:37, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

:I second this suggestion. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:01, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Domain-specific languages bookshelf]] ==

Hello,

would you please check the [[Wikibooks:Domain-specific languages bookshelf]]. There are several books on the whish list for which your book has chapters. Do we need extra books or will the chapters be exhaustive enough once they are finished. If the later is true then please trim the whish list.

&lt;font color=purple&gt;Many of the chapters are planned for revision.  And will probably be revised in future classes.  This cycle of revision will be over in June 2006, let see if they give a better picture then&lt;/font&gt;

Thank you.

== [[XML]] versus [[Programming:XML]] versus [[XML: Managing Data Exchange]] ==

The following is a chronology posted by [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]:

* At the start, [[XML]] redirected to [[XML: Managing Data Exchange]], and there was a separate book called [[Programming:XML]].
* At 5 November 2005, [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] ( [[Special:Contributions/Kernigh|contribs]] ) decided to propose the merger of [[Programming:XML]], a short introduction to XML, into [[XML: Managing Data Exchange]], general introduction to XML, by marking the two pages with {{tl|mergeto}} and {{tl|mergefrom}} respectively.
* At 29 December 2005, [[User:68.61.36.66|68.61.36.66]] ( [[Special:Contributions/68.61.36.66|contribs]] ) made four edits. The first two edits changed other users' comments on this page (Talk:XML: Managing Data Exchange). Kernigh reverted these edits at 18 January 2006. The third edit replaced the redirect at [[XML]] with list linking [[XML]] to both [[XML: Managing Data Exchange]] and [[Programming:XML]] ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=XML&amp;oldid=321310 see here]. A post to [[Talk:XML]] said that [[XML]] should become a new book that is a general introduction to XML.
* From 13 to 17 January 2006, [[User:68.184.159.189|68.184.159.189]] ( [[Special:Contributions/68.184.159.189|contribs]] ) made several edits to [[XML: Managing Data Exchange]], mostly small changes to spelling and presentation format. During this process, 68.184.159.189 removed the merge tags of Kernigh, and 68.184.159.189 replied to 68.61.36.66 at [[Talk:XML]].
* At 16 January 2006, [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] ( [[Special:Contributions/Derbeth|contribs]] ) sent [[Programming:XML]] to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]].

I have decided to again redirect [[XML]] to [[XML: Managing Data Exchange]], and to vote to delete [[Programming:XML]]. Because I am redirecting Talk:XML here, you can &lt;big&gt;'''[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:XML&amp;oldid=340293 view the posts of 68.61.36.66 and 68.184.159.189 through this permalink]'''&lt;/big&gt;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:32, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

== Orphaned pages ==

I've found [[Answers (XML)]] - will you merge it to this book or can it be deleted? Please mark useless pags with {{tl|delete}}. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:01, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== Speedy Deletion Candidate ==

I am confused with a couple of pages I've come across that seem to be related to this Wikibook.  All I'm asking for is to have somebody try to explain the rationale for trying to delete these Wikibook modules and to note where the content may have been duplicated or some other editorial reason for trying to delete this stuff.  For now, I'm removing the deletion template tags, but if the contributors here would like to remove this content, please make a clear note as to why you feel the content needs to go.

Something simple like: &quot;This is a duplcate of [[XML: Managing Data Exchange/Introduction to XML]]&quot; or &quot;obsolete content no longer need for project&quot; is all that I'm looking for.  Leaving the reason out nor any discussion on the discussion page about why it needs to be deleted makes it hard for me as an administrator to understand why the content needs to go.  Thank you for your work in this part of Wikibooks, however.  The pages to review are the following:

*[[XML: Managing Data Exchange/Single-Entity (Chapter 2)]]
*[[XML: Managing Data Exchange/Introduction]]
*[[XML: Managing Data Exchange/A single entity (Answers)]]

== Thanks! ==

Hi everyone,

Thanks to everyone that is working on this.  Great start.  I am an instructor and am trying to create a series of free XML learning modules usable in Moodle and I would like to use/reuse as much work as possble.

I teach in the US and many of the organizations use ISO/IEC 11179 date element names (see the WikiPedia entries on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_11179 ISO/IEC_11179].  This uses an UpperCamelCase three part name.

My goal is to start with very simple re-usable teaching structures and build on them.  I would also like to add quiz materials in some XML format for Moodle.  I am looking into that now.

I put a sample of what I am working on here:  [[XML Schema]] before I realized that some of the tables were part of your materials.  I apologize for the duplication.

Also, please tell me more about yourselves, your background and objectives.  Anyone build re-usable learning objects before? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/Leanrning_Objects Leanrning Objects].  I have not done this in the past.  Everything was a one-off based on my library of over 3000 PowerPoint slides. It seems very hard to be able to design learning modules that can be re-used by many people.

- Dan [[User:dmccreary]]

Hi Dan !

Thanks for your interest!  You have just stumbled upon a work in progress and you will probably see many changes in the coming months.  We are students at the University of Georgia in the Management Information Systems department.  This XML wikibook is a class project.  We are learning, teaching, and revising together.  Dr. Watson is our teacher and I am a member of the Editorial Board.  Things are just getting started and may appear a bit messy, but we are working on organizing and cleaning up the book.  Feel free to give us suggestions (we saw your post in the one to one relationship chapter).  It is nice to have outside eyes.  Also, you can just email me at viji@uga.edu 

Thanks, Viji

== Suggested IDE/editor for this textbook? ==

Should there be a recommended IDE or XML editor for this textbook?  The preface recommends NetBeans, which is lovely (depending on how you feel about Oracle...), but then there's also a whole chapter near the end of the book about the proprietary Exchanger XML Lite editor, and the rest of the text is IDE-agnostic.  It seems that the book could benefit from either referring to a consistent editor (e.g. all the examples being NetBeans-specific, with a YMMV note for those using other software), or from intentionally exposing the reader to a wide range of software.  As it is, it's inconsistent and perhaps confusing to people new to markup languages and text editors.

'''Øllebrød''' (Danish for ''Beer Bread'') is a Danish bread porridge, easily made from (dry) [[cookbook:Rye Bread|rye bread]] using this very simple recipe.

Øllebrød, together with [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] (and other [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]), [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], rye bread, [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], was an important nutritional element of traditional Danish cuisine until the 1800s. 

A Danish family usually had a big pot on the stove in which they threw leftover bread and beer dregs. This was served as an everyday meal, morning and afternoon. The pot was seldom emptied, so it was a kind of continuous meal.

==Ingredients==
*1 loaf of day-old [[Cookbook:Rye Bread|rye bread]]
*Malt [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] -  preferably a sweet dark stout

==Procedure==
Take some amount of rye bread, preferably without whole grain, and put it to soak in [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] for 6&amp;ndash;12 hours. Feel free to use whatever beer that is the cheapest, the alcohol is going to vaporise anyway. You can also substitute the beer with water, if you want.

Let it boil slowly for about 1 hour. Add more beer if it's too dry, the consistency should be like that of [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]]. If you want it sweet you can mix in some [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or artificial sweetner (for diabetics). For a fresher taste, add a touch of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]].

Serve with [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]] if you're introducing this meal to someone who is not Danish.

Alternatively, here is an easy, time saving recipe. In the evening, cut away the crust from the rye bread, cut it into cubes. Put the bread in a pot and cover it with water or beer. Heat the water to a boil and then let it stand over the night, covered with a lid. In the morning, heat it while stirring until it steams vigorously, adding water if it gets too dry. Serve with milk, like corn flakes. Makes for a warm, very solid breakfast.

'''Peanut butter''' is a food product usually consisting of roasted and ground [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanut]]s, sometimes sweetened. It is commonly sold in grocery stores, but can be made at home. Many styles are available; the most popular are creamy (smooth) and crunchy, but honey-roasted or wholenut varieties can also be found. Creamy peanut butter is made by grinding all of the mixture very finely. The crunchier styles leave portions of the mixture with a coarser grind, resulting in larger pieces of peanut interspersed with the creamier fine ground mixture.

Used in sandwiches (particularly the classic [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich|peanut butter and jelly sandwich]]), candy (for example, Reese's Pieces), and [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]], it is a good source of protein, and is popular with children. 

For people with nut allergies, the intense concentration of nuts in peanut butter can cause fatal anaphylactic shock. Peanut butter is often contaminated with aflatoxin.

In 1893, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg originated an early variety of peanut butter at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan. Kellogg, along with his brother, Will Keith Kellogg, patented a process for making peanut butter, but it used steamed peanuts rather than roasted peanuts.

==Ingredients==
Makes about 1 1/2 cup.
#2 cups of peanuts
#1 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil, peanut oil or canola oil
#1 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil
#1/2 teaspoon of sugar
#2 teaspoon of honey
#Pinch of salt

==Steps==
Combine the peanuts and vegetable oil (peanut oil or canola oil) in a bowl. Place tinfoil on a baking pan and bake the peanuts at 200-350 F degrees. Mix with olive oil. Process or blend for a while. Add in sugar, honey and salt. Process or blend until you are sastified.

I'm not sure this is the best organization for a book on compilers.  It's missing a lot of important detail in areas (regular vs. context-free languages, SSA intermediate representation, etc).  Plus, there's a lot of room devoted to stuff that is not really compiler related (garbage collection and IDEs for instance).

I think a better organization would be:

* Introduction
** What is a compiler
** History of compilers
** Brief background in language theory (chomsky hierarchy)
* Frontend
** Parsing regular languages
*** Regular expressions
*** Lex
** Parsing context free languages
*** shift-reduce
*** recursive-decent
*** packrat?
*** Yacc
** Putting it together
*** Simple lex/yacc toy language
* Intermediate Representations
** Parse Trees
** Semantic Analaysis
** Abstract Syntax Trees
** Advanced Representations
*** RTL
*** Single Statement Assignment (SSA) Form
*** Hashed SSA Form
* Optimizers
** Dataflow Analysis
*** In-depth on optimizations (dead-code, common subexpression, etc.)
** Alias Analysis
* Backends (Code Generators)
** Various BURGS
** Hand Generation

I'll leave this here for a bit to see what others think and then start refactoring.

== what language to use ==

It may be more informative for an intro text to use a language like Scheme, which can be easily presented with and without lex and yacc.

--[[User:Matt|Matt]] 15:26, 9 May 2004 (UTC)

: We  do not want to be beholden to just one programming language. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:15, 9 May 2004 (UTC)

Oh, I wasn't suggesting the book should be &quot;Constructing a Compiler for Scheme.&quot;  Typically, a text on compilers has alternating theory/practice sections.  I was merely suggesting that Scheme be used in the practice sections.

What language would you use?

--[[User:Matt|Matt]] 16:45, 17 May 2004 (UTC)


I have limited experience in compiler writing (interactive Basic compiler written in assembler, Pascal-like high level language written in itself, plus a slight aquaintance with flex and bison c.f. lex and yacc).  Fluent in Fortran, C, Algol 60, Basic, Pascal, some experience with C++, PL/1, fluent in assembler for 6 different computer architectures (not x86 infortunately), expect to learn Java this year.  I'm willing to have a stab at this wikibook over the next year, but would probably need to redo the existing outline, and would prefer to use C or simple C++ as the implementation language for any examples.

--[[User:Murray Langton|Murray Langton]] 22:00 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Can you elaborate why the old outline needs to be redone? I think we should start from a small book, so it can be manageable to us. The current outline seems to be too much. Also, I disagree to use C++. We expect that the textbook is used mostly in college, and nowadays students learn Java to write code, and many don't know C/C++. Also, the fact that java is generally machine-independent is quite nice to us. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|TakuyaMurata]] 23:39, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I don't think there's any need for &quot;implementation examples.&quot;  Languages should be described in the appropriate notation (regular expressions or EBNF), optimizations should be described via dataflow equations, and so on.  Compilers have a rich set of domain specific languages and this shouldn't be hidden.

--[[User:AnthonyLiguori|AnthonyLiguori]] 03:39, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

== 3000 lines? ==

In the first section, we have the following:

&quot;Note that a compiler is a non-trivial computer program; when written
completely by hand a non-optimising compiler for a simple source
language is likely to be upwards of 3000 lines long. Some
compiler-writing tools are available which can reduce this size.&quot;

That 3000 is somewhat misleading, especially for a simple source
language.

For instance:

Wirth's famous PL/0 (Pascal subset) has been implemented in many
different languages - C and Pascal versions usually run around 1000
lines or less.

A Pascal subset, powerful enough to compile itself, has been
implemented in less than 1500 lines of Pascal.

Another Pascal subset, Tiny-Pascal, is around 1100 lines of code, and
can also compile itself.

At least two C compilers, with enough of the language implemented to
self-compile, have been implemented in less than 1000 lines of code
each.

Various Basic's (with strings and arrays) can be implemented in 1000
lines or less.

All of these are hand-written.

While it can and does take many thousands of lines of code to
implement a compiler for a more complicated language (full ANSI-C,
C++, Java, etc.), compilers for simple (but useful) languages can
easily be implemented in less than 1500 lines of hand-written code.

I realize this is being very picky, but there is no need to make
compilers appear to be even more complicated than they already are :-)

--[[User:Sam|Sam]] 16:30, 6 July 2005 (UTC)

== donation ==

I have had a small book/large paper on writing compilers on my web site for ten years or so.
[[http://pages.prodigy.net/j_alan/hitech/compiler/compmain.html]http://pages.prodigy.net/j_alan/hitech/compiler/compmain.html] 

Feel free to make any use of it, including direcly copying and pasting (everybody does it 
anyway!)

I would especially encourage you to make use of the sections on theory, including using
Chomsky Normal Formal and Extended Backus-Naur Form to design languages, and converting
such forms to recursive-descent parsers.

If you use the code examples, they should probably be converted to a more modern language
as I'm not sure how much Pascal is used anymore.

== theory ==

the opening paragraph of this wikibook claims that theory is kept to a minimum. I dont think this is a good tactic. Theory should be included and sufficiently explained. It is reasonable, however, to separate the &quot;non-essential&quot; theory into optional subsections. for instance, each section could have &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;main ideas&quot;, &quot;theory&quot;, and &quot;examples&quot; subsections. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 05:27, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== implementation language ==

the subject of which language to use is an important one, and i think it deserves it's own section. I think, that it would be short-sighted to limit this book to any single existing language, because languages come in and out of favor relatively quickly. a book written 10 years ago in C would probably be rewritten today in VB or Java. unfortunately, a book written exclusively in language X exclude people who dont use language X. I have 2 recommendations: 1) all code examples be written in at least 2 different languages, possibly more for important examples, or 2) all code examples be written in Pseudocode (or even wikicode). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 05:21, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

: My understanding is that most compiler books have a bunch of &quot;toy&quot; languages as examples.
: But then they have a long chapter on a language powerful enough to write a [[w:Self-hosting]] compiler.
: There seems to be a tradeoff between a &quot;powerful&quot; language that can describe any particular toy language in a few lines (but the compiler for that language is long and complex), vs. a &quot;simple&quot; language that takes many more lines to describe that toy language (but the compiler for that language is much shorter and easier to understand).

: Will one of our code examples be one of these mind-bending &quot;self-hosted&quot; compilers? If so, an alternate implementation in some other language will help avoid the [[Wiki:ChickenAndEggProblem]].

=== output language ===

:: What output language should the compilers in this wikibook spit out? --[[Special:Contributions/68.0.124.33|68.0.124.33]] ([[User talk:68.0.124.33|talk]]) 00:00, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

:: Some options are:
:: * C-- is a &quot;portable machine language&quot; specifically designed for high-level compilers to generate ([[w:C--]]).
:: * MMIX is a fictional machine language specifically designed to be easy to learn ([[w:MMIX]]).
:: * [[Embedded Systems/ARM Microprocessors|ARM]] is the machine language used in most 32 bit CPUs ([[w:ARM]]).

== so much for organization ==
I don't think it is time for us to discuss the organization of the book. The book, as of this writing, has almost no stuff yet but some just outline. I think it works just fine if we simply write more by adding examples, explaining theories, constructing exercise problems etc. We can easily reorganize those materials later on after gaining more sense of what the book should be. In other words, the book should be what it turned out to be and not necessarily what was planned initially. People have different views in mind about what the book should be and it would be the best if people simply add what they know. -- [[User:219.168.92.42|219.168.92.42]] 11:52, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== Very Tiny Basic Lex/Yacc interpreter ==

I am currently writing an interpreter in C, using Lex/Yacc and Make. The language is that defined in the current Case Study 1. I feel we need an example of a Lex/Yacc project, since it is a common approach. Also since interpreting Very Tiny Basic is pretty straightforward, we could write interpreters for it in many languages/ways to demonstrate the differences in technique (and try to underline the similarities).
Anyway, I plan to make it [[Compiler Construction:Case Study 1B]], although it belongs in a much latter place than Case Study 1. I hope to write a useful article with it. Any suggestions would be appreciated. [[User:Matt73|Matt73]] 03:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

:I think that is a good idea.  Maybe it's not necessary to do it in many languages so much as many techniques.  A few that come to mind are domain specific languages (eg. Yacc/Lex), recursive-descent parsers and regexp driven lexers (which is what Yacc and Lex compile to), parser combinators (though I think you might need a declarative language to do those properly) and DCGs (Definitive Clause Grammars, used in languages like Prolog and Mercury).

:I also notice that, while VTB is defined in Bachus-Naur form, I don't see anywhere that BNF is actually defined.  I also think that a few sample VTB programs are needed, as that shows a language better than BNF.

:[[User:Jonmmorgan|Jonmmorgan]] 00:26, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

::I've written a couple of sample programs, but I haven't done any BASIC programming for a long time (which is a good thing).  Could someone please review them?

::[[User:Jonmmorgan|Jonmmorgan]] 23:39, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

About size of hand written and table-driven compiler. Both type of compilers may have less then 700-1000 lines of code and it may compile itself. To do that only limited language subset must be umplemented (one-dimension arrays, functions without arguments, if, while, call and assign stmts) and some checks may be omitted.

:[[User:avhohlov|avhohlov]], 20 March 2006

:Avhohlov, I'm not sure who/what you are replying to?  Regardless, your note is very interesting.             Do you have an example?  Thanks -- 

:[[User:72.145.148.76|72.145.148.76]] 13:34, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

Here [[http://www.avhohlov.narod.ru/p9890en.htm]] you may see
small compiler (less then 1000 lines, DOS) and modified Wirth's Pascal-S (less then 2000 lines but much more expressive, P-CODE)
both self-compiled. There are no differences to translate small compiler to any widespread languages (for example C or Pascal).
DOS are obsolete now and P-CODE may have some benefits but it requires virtual machine compiled by other compiler or assembler. Generation of Linux/ELF file may be relatively simple (see next link).

Also you may see OTCC (Obfuscated Tiny C Compiler) at [[http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/otcc]].
Very small but it's a hacker's code.

== Lex/Yacc ==

I am writing an outline for a proposed book on Lex/Yacc (and Flex/Bison). These two programs are certainly worth writing about, and they can be used for more then just compilers. [[User:Whiteknight/Flex and Yacc|here is my proposed outline]]. If we have a book dedicated to these programs, we won't need to waste time trying to explain them here in the compiler book. Also, I think that some of the contributers here would make good contributers to this new book. Any feedback would be appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

It's a very good idea, and would certainly help this book. I feel that this should be a more general book than &quot;How to make a compiler using X technique&amp;tools&quot; and it would be good to be able to give theory and simple examples then refer to the Flex/Yacc book (and hopefully others). Of course, the eventual direction of this book will be decided by whoever ends up writing it (not me, I don't know enough theory). I intend to finish my VTB interpreter, it just needs the interpreting code, finishing and some article writing. The reason I chose to write it was so that it flows on from the 1st case study. Hopefully when my exams are over I'll be able to finish it. Good luck with Flex/Yacc, and maybe I'll be able to help out. [[User:Matt73|Matt73]] 13:49, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

:If we had a good book here on wikibooks about automata theory, and context-free languages, writing a general book about compilers and theory would be a sinch. Maybe I will get to work on an outline for a book like that as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

== Automata Theory ==

I have decided to create a new book on the subject of Automata Theory. This way, we can have a wikibooks-based resource for the background information, and then this book can use that resource to cover the ground-work behind compilers, computer languages, etc. I have posted a preliminary outline for this new book [[User:Whiteknight/Automata Theory|HERE on my user page]]. Any comments or suggestions are welcome. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:27, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Safety optimization ==

What are
''&quot;safety [optimizations] reducing the possibility of data structures becoming corrupted&quot;''
?

While I've certainly seen many optimizations that are &quot;not re-entrant&quot;, &quot;less safe&quot;, &quot;non-volatile-safe&quot;, or otherwise &quot;unsafe&quot;, I am unfamiliar with optimizations that make the code *more* safe than non-optimized code.

Please enlighten me.

The uneven dumbbell consisted of just two particles. These results can be extended to cover systems of many particles, and continuous media.

Suppose we have ''N'' particles, masses ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, with total mass ''M''. Then the centre of mass is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\frac{\sum_n m_n \mathbf{r}_n}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the summation convention only applies to numbers indexing axes, not to ''n'' which indexes particles.

We again define

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_n=\mathbf{r}_n-\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic energy splits into

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2}M V^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_n m_n {v^*_n}^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the angular momentum into

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=M \mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{V} + 
\sum_n m_n \mathbf{r}^*_n \times  \mathbf{v}^*_n&lt;/math&gt;

It is not useful to go onto moments of inertia unless the system is approximately rigid but this is still a useful split, letting us separate the overall motion of the system from the internal motions of its part.</text>

__NOTOC__
If the set of particles in the previous chapter form a rigid body, rotating with angular velocity '''&amp;omega;''' about its centre of mass, then the results concerning the moment of inertia from the penultimate chapter can be extended.

We get

:&lt;math&gt;I_{ij}=\sum_n m_n (r_n^2\delta_{ij}-{r_n}_i {r_n}_j)&lt;/math&gt;

where (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''3&lt;/sub&gt;) is the position of the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; mass.

In the limit of a continuous body this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;I_{ij}=\int_V \rho(\mathbf{r})(r^2\delta_{ij}-r_i r_j) \, dV&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;rho; is the density.

Either way we get, splitting '''L''' into orbital and internal angular momentum,

:&lt;math&gt;L_i=M\epsilon_{ijk}R_j V_k+ I_{ij}\omega_j&lt;/math&gt;

and, splitting ''T'' into rotational and translational kinetic energy, 

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} M V_i V_i + \frac{1}{2} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j&lt;/math&gt;

It is always possible to make '''I''' a diagonal matrix, by a suitable choice of
axis.

=Mass Moments Of Inertia Of Common Geometric Shapes=

The moments of inertia of simple shapes of uniform density are well known.

=== Spherical shell ===
mass ''M'', radius ''a''
:&lt;math&gt;I_{xx} = I_{yy} = I_{zz}=\frac{2}{3}Ma^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Solid ball ===
mass ''M'', radius ''a''
:&lt;math&gt;I_{xx} = I_{yy} = I_{zz}=\frac{2}{5}Ma^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Thin rod ===
mass ''M'', length ''a'', orientated along ''z''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;I_{xx} = I_{yy} = \frac{1}{12}Ma^2 \quad I_{zz}=0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Disc ===
mass ''M'', radius ''a'', in ''x-y'' plane
:&lt;math&gt;I_{xx} = I_{yy} = \frac{1}{4}Ma^2 \quad 
I_{zz}=\frac{1}{2}Ma^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Cylinder ===
mass ''M'', radius ''a'', length ''h'' orientated along ''z''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;I_{xx} = I_{yy} = M\left( \frac{a^2}{4}+\frac{h^2}{12} \right) \quad 
I_{zz}=\frac{1}{2}Ma^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Thin rectangular plate ===
mass ''M'', side length ''a'' parallel to ''x''-axis,  side length ''b'' parallel to ''y''-axis
:&lt;math&gt;I_{xx}=M\frac{b^2}{12} \quad I_{yy}=M\frac{a^2}{12} \quad 
I_{zz}=M \left( \frac{a^2}{12}+\frac{b^2}{12} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

cuisine. It provides carbohydrates, proteins, and a full stomach. It also tastes great.

When cooked with rice, this recipe is [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]]. 
It isn't gluten free when cooked with bulgur (wheat).

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (uncooked) or [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulgur]]
* 1 cup dry [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]]
* 1 medium sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 cups water
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Baharat|baharat]]
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]

== Procedure==
[[Image:Mejadrah-cooking.s.jpg|thumb|right]]
The more common recipe uses rice. Bulgur can be substituted for rice, with the exact same procedure. 

# Fry the lentils in oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously, until the first beans show signs of scorching. (To maintain sweeter flavour, only cook onions till transparent.)
# Add salt, baharat, cumin, ground cardamom.
# Add 2 cups water and cover. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed by the lentils.
# Fry the rice in oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously, until the grains change colour.
# Add salt, black or white pepper, and ground cardamom.
# Add 2 cups water and cover. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer. After 5 minutes turn the heat off, and leave standing for another 10 minutes.
# Cut the onion into thin strips (about ½ cm x 4 cm).
# Fry the onion in mixed olive oil until crisp and translucent.
# Mix the lentils and rice, and top with the fried onion.
# Add 2 parts lentils to 1 part rice for a moist consistency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Aren't most of these countries in the Near East, rather than Middle East?

Hi.  Israel needs its own separate entry.  It is a country of immigrants from all over the world, and the foods that have become popular - while many are Middle Eastern - many others are quite certainly not.  Do Palestinians eat Kubana?  Jahnun?  Gefilte fish?  Osem chocolate spread?  Even the Middle Eastern ones have taken on their own Israeli flavor.
:While I don't disagree with your position, you have de-linked an existing page, and replaced it with non existant links to two pages.  If possible, please look at [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Israel / Palestine]] and determine where it should go, then let a logged in user know, so they can move the page to the correct title.  Thanks, [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:37, 16 May 2004 (UTC)

::I can't find the reason why '''Arab cuisine''' was deleted.  I have a few recipes that are wide-spread throughout the Arab countries like ''Khubz'' (pita bread) and ''Ful'' (fava bean stew).
::BTW, I think that '''Israeli cuisine''' does belong in the correct geographic area. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:David Cheater|David Cheater]] ([[User talk:David Cheater|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/David Cheater|contribs]]) 2007-06-19T01:40:36.&lt;/small&gt;

:::The logs show that &quot;Arab cuisine&quot; was deleted because it was empty. I don't know anything further than that. Perhaps you should take this up on the [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents|Cookbook talk]] page, where it will be seen by more Cookbook editors. 
:::BTW, ''ful'' just means fava bean; there are many recipes using ful, so perhaps you might like to call your ful recipe something other than just &quot;ful&quot;, e.g. [[w:ful medames|ful medames]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''search engine''' is a type of computer software used to search data in the form of text or a database for specified information.

Search engines normally consist of spiders (also known as bots) which roam the web searching for links and keywords. They send collected data back to the indexing software which categorizes and adds the links to databases with their related keywords. When you specify a search term the engine does not scan the whole web but extracts related links from the database.

Please take note that this is '''not''' a simple process.  Search engines literally scan through millions of pages in its database. Once this has taken place all the results are put together in order of relevancy.  Remember also not to get a search engine and directory mixed up.  Yes they are used interchangeably, but they do in fact perform two different tasks!

Before 1993 the term search engine never existed. From then until now that has changed drastically, and almost everyone knows what it is. Since the Internet is used by millions of Americans daily, a search engine sees a lot of visitors especially ones such as Google and Yahoo. Almost all of us use one of the two if we have the Internet. By simply typing words into the engine, we get several results which gives us a list of sites. (Seigel) 

Usually a search engine sends out a spider which fetches as many documents as possible. An index is then  created by what is called an indexer that reads the documents and creates it. Only meaningful results are created for each query though, a process called proprietary algorithm. (Webopedia)

'''Force Quit''' is an action applet that it used to deal with crashed and non-responding applications by forcing them off the screen. It allows you to deal with them in just two clicks. This is often useful when beta testing applications and it crashes on you.

To add to the panel, select Add (Some systems use &quot;Add to Panel...&quot;), Actions, Force Quit. It will appear as a Window icon with a large red cross on it.

To use.
# Click the &quot;Force Quit&quot; button.

Hi and welcome to wikibooks. Most of the links you have listed as &quot;broken&quot; are in fact as yet uncreated links. Many of them have adapted names from [[en:wikipedia]]. So to fix the articles we need to go there, find the relavent page, copy and paste it over here then go through the text and fix the various references to wikpedia by chaning them to wikibooks.

== Luxor XUL link ==
I removed the link to &quot;luxor xul&quot;, as it is not related to Mozilla XUL, other than in concept. People from &quot;Open XUL Alliance&quot; have been trolling around for quite a long time already, posting links to their &quot;xul&quot; projects on various Mozilla-related sites. --[[User:195.146.72.90|195.146.72.90]] 11:19, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

== Various comments ==
: ''The ‘id’ attribute is important in that it is the way to identify the window so that scripts can refer to it.''
Not really. Scripts can use &lt;code&gt;document.documentElement&lt;/code&gt; to refer to the window element. The id is used for binding icons to the window, and sometimes in the overlays. 

: ''All events and attributes must be written in lowercase.''
Actually it's just that XUL is case-sensitive, as is XML. Attributes that have special meaning in XUL happen to be all-lowercase. This doesn't stop you from using mixed-case attributes for your own needs.

: ''All strings must be double quoted.''
Attributes must be in quotes, just as in XML. It doesn't mean that &quot;all strings must be double quoted&quot;.

: ''Save it anywhere but be sure to give the file the .xul extension. Now just double click on it and it should open in your Mozilla or Netscape browser.''
.xul files are not associated with Mozilla  by default

== revision suggestions==
*Bold key words and start with clear definition after each. 
*Follow author guidelines to revise chapter.
*Show more widgets and some user created widgets.
*Change the first example -perhaps use an example that we have been using through out the class.(movie, professor)
*Create an assignment and place it at the bottom of the page. Use XUL and widgets to create a page that displays information about UGA.
*Edit the conclusion section. (Try to make is sound less like a Firefox employee wrote it.)
*Place Learning objectives in a box to set them apart from the rest of the text (as done in previous chapters.)
[[User:Karl Strength|Karl Strength]] 16:42, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Editorial Board == Moussa Mané
*You can move the &quot;written by&quot; part as a reference at the bottom, so the chapter stays consistent with the rest of the book
*If you notice there is too much text, like whole block. The reader can even find a specific information. Try to break everything down. You may need to change the structure a little with more sub-sections
*Example:  first a section on widget where you explain what they are, then how to use them and add them
*One for Events...then sub section would be Event handlers and another Responding to Events.
*Fell free to change the title of the sections (The basics, A first example, Adding Widgets...) I find them inconsistent. (let me know if you need clarification on this)
*A shorter introduction. the rest of the info can be added as a new section
*The example can be movie, professor or any other simple one
*Give a summary.
*Add Exercises and answers link

==Professor==
*Karl and Moussa's suggestions will help improve the chapter considerably
*Try to use a tourism example to stick with the themes covered in other chapters. Maybe cities and attractions :)
*Change sample code to fit with author guidelines
*Change so that reference browser is Firefox rather than Mozilla or Netscape
*Correct labeling of code (eg figure should not be within the code)
*Check all the references are still valid

== XUL's &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;window&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ≠ HTML's &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag! ==

The article states that the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; tag of [[w:XUL|XUL]] is like the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tag of [[w:HTML|HTML]] — wich is not true. the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; tag is more like the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; tag (they're both the root tags) and XUL can for example also have the  &lt;code&gt;dialog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;overlay&lt;/code&gt;  root tags.

==SI Fundamental Units==
These are the seven basic SI units from which all other units are constructed.

|}

==SI Derived Units==
All other units are ''derived units''.  They are built from fundamental units.  This is a small selection of units that may be found in General Chemistry.

==SI Prefixes==

A prefix appears before a unit's symbol when expressing very large or very small quantities.  For example: 0.001 kg = 1 g = 1000 mg.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Let's start some books or topics today to address these issues ==

I do '''NOT''' believe this is the place for technical support for programming and hardware &quot;issues.&quot;

This form of support is provided by an enormous collection of well established and documented resources.   There are countless mailing lists and news groups and IRC channels that you can subscribe to if you need support, developer information, get answers to your questions or hear the latest news.

'''To address some of these issues:'''

Let's go for it.  I have started two books below that I believe may help.

[[Book of Technical Support]]

=== Forms of Technical Support ===

Technical support for hardware and software issues are provided by an enormous collection of well established and documented resources.   There are countless mailing lists and news groups and IRC channels that you can subscribe to if you need support, developer information, get answers to your questions or hear the latest news.

Mailing lists provide users and interested parties support and communication through the use of email.  Anyone can join a mailing list and as a member you will automatically recieve and be able to send questions, comments or news on any topic that the group supports.  To join any of the known mailing lists below, visit the link indicated, follow the simple instructions to join and have fun!  The requirements to join a list are generally as obtrusive a joining wikipedia.com.

IRC channels provide support by means of &quot;live&quot; chat.

News Groups provide support in a manner similar to &quot;Mailing List.&quot;  To subscribe to a news group.....

The following list of software support resources are organized alphabetically by the common name of the application or programming language.

My suggestion is lets make like as simple to begin, like keep it alphabetically.
As the size of the lists grow, we can re-group, sort, as needed.

I suggest a list of external links are created in the wiki tradition as follows...

[[&lt;resource-location&gt; &lt;common-resouce-name&gt; &lt;resource-type&gt;]]

where,

   &lt;resource-location&gt; is the url of the mail subscribe page, news server, or IRC channel as required by our wiki.
   &lt;resource-name&gt; is the name common name of the software title or programming language.
   &lt;resource-type&gt; := email | news | irc
   &lt;resource-state&gt; := active | inactive | archive
   &lt;resource-desription&gt;

== Software Support List of Lists (alphabetical by language of application name) ==

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
I have a very related concern to the one expressed below.  Namely I think there should be a kind of project in wikibooks devoted to technical support for hardware and software.  I am not sure if this is the place to talk about this but if anyone knows a better place could they please direct me or just copy my post to that place.  Right now I usually debug problems I have with my computer by going on google and doing searches.  This method is usually effective but sometimes it is problematic because the solution to problems is often stored within support forums and google sometimes does not do a good job searching these forums.  Anyways I think there should be a bookshelf within IT devoted to technical support of any hardware/software.  This technical support should be organized by books devoted to pieces of software or hardware.  They should include extensive list of problems, error messeges and reasons for the problems as well as proposed solutions. 

--[[User:Assman|Assman]] 06:28, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)   

I'm not sure if this would be a good place, but it's closest I got so far. What I have been thinking about is the ever-repeated question of &quot;will &lt;device&gt; work or be worth anything&quot; that nags especially non-windos people. It would be nice to have a large-ish wiki that has a net of descriptions of manufacturers, devices, drivers and standards &amp; interfaces and descriptions and relations where possible. 

Particularly sought-after is information like &quot;Is the Foocorp Idlemaster 2000 an usb storage device that will work everywhere or a proprietary protocol doorstop whose support will be buried in half-a year when the company goes under and/or I update my OS?&quot; or &quot;Will this phone eat Hayes/AT over IR or EIA-[24]32? OBEX?&quot; etc. Likewise for things that appear as serial devices, support changer commands etc.

Manufacturers are '''obscenely''' bad at producing this information and with the customer base they have, they don't have to. There is also little incentive for them to support aging hardware.

As for the wiki, for example under usb-storage, you would have a list of devices that appear as usb storage devices. It might have a link to Linux usb-storage.o and equivalent drivers on other systems. Each would have a list of devices that have been confirmed to work.

This could also contain parts lists for &quot;special&quot; manufacturers, eg Sun or IBM part numbers, what they are, what they fit in and what drivers or os versions they work with etc. Many user groups (like TUHS) might also be interested in getting something more than scattered personal repositories for their objects of interest.

The wiki could be as coherent or fragmented, as large or focused as people manage to make it. Databases are just too heavy and often specialized.

== Disorganization ==

Why is there no hardware and software umbrella categories in the Information Technology bookshelf?
--[[User:Lordscissorhand|Lordscissorhand]] 14:58, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Reorganisation of IT Bookshelf ==

I've given the subject some more thought. I'm thinking that the separation of the monolothic 'IT bookshelf' into three (below) might aid navigability.
*Computer Science - All topics related to the research of computer use and technology.
*Programming - Language guides, framework guides, software design guides, patterns etc.
*IT/IS - All software guides, technology guides, certification etc.

The problem would then be catagorising books. It is sometimes hard to make a distinction between computer science and the other two catagories. The question is - do we want to make as general a distinction as possible at the 'bookshelf' level (i.e only have two (see below)), or try to define clearly several new IT related bookshelves?

[[User:Robcowie|Robcowie]] 12:30, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:It'd be fine with that. I've already been standardizing true CS books to be put in the namespace &quot;Computer Science:&quot;. The defintion is: if a university would teach a course on the subject in their computer science department, then it belongs as a Computer Science book. I wouldn't make the defintion so narrow to be &quot;research of computer use and technology&quot;. To me, Computer Science is &quot;the study of the creation, analysis, and limits of computations; for different computational models&quot;. An algorithms book covers both the analysis and creation of computations, while an intro to programming book would only cover the creation. Theorhetical computer science studies the limits.

:Whatever the case, Computer Science does seem a bit out of place with the IT books. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:15, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:(Also, I like the three categories: Programming, Computer Science, and IT. An intro to the MFC classes isn't an IT book, but it certainly isn't computer science (and thus it's &quot;programming&quot; instead). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]])

I agree that a reorganization should take place.  I think that the horizontal listing of books at the top of the page doesn't quite match the organization of books once it gets organized below, which is kind of disorienting.  It seems that the horizontal listing is what people first encounter when visiting the bookshelf pages, but the breakdown that occurs later in the IT page is how people seem to want to organize it as books become more developed or as more books are added.
[[User:Jotaboca|jotaboca]] 02:36, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)



It seems to me that the IT bookshelf has outgrown itself. There are many books that could be more easily found if moved to new sections. For example, there is a 'Computer Science' bookshelf within the IT bookshelf. However, some of its books should perhaps not be in it. It is also not directly linked to from within the IT bookshelf. There are therefore several books that do not appear in the IT bookshelf list and con only be located by searching.

I suggest that - as well as a reorganisation of the topics within the IT bookshelf, it should be split into two bookshelves:
*'Computing' - for non-academic books such as software guides, certification books and Linux install guides.
*'Information Science' - for more technical, advanced topics such as Programming, software design, hardware design etc.

I'm new to the wiki so I don't yet fully understand the concept of moving books, or the difference between modules, books and pages. Consequently, I haven't figured out the best way to proceed should this idea be accepted by users.

Any thoughts would be gratefully recieved.

[[User:Robcowie|Robcowie]] 17:23, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: Shouldn't we create the subcategory '''Computer Science/Logic''' to put there [[Computer Science:Logic|Logic for Computer Scientists]] and [[21 Century Math|21 Century Math Method]]? (In the future these books should share some content either by inclusion or reference.) What to do with the template ([[Template:IT bookshelf]]) regarding CS logic topic? What's about refering [[21 Century Math|21 Century Math Method]] from there? -- [[Porton]] ([[Apr 22, 2005]]), you can reply at [[User_talk:Porton]]

::I think Computer Science related books could all go under the umbrella of Computer Science for now: there's aren't too many true CS books (most are Programming or IT books), so there isn't much need for finer grained categories. As for sharing information, this seems to be a tough problem: What we've been doing with the Data Structures and Algorithms books is to let some of the content just be copies. It makes the books stand out on their own better, and creates more opportunities. (Also, keeping a tight integration of chapters in the same book makes it a better book. Having to keep a couple of chapters independent is more of a headache than having two similar, but not the same, portions of text out there). Because it's all GFDL anyway copying poses no real problems and a little redundancy can be good. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:31, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

I vote for the split in some manner.  Any of the above suggestions work for me.  I'm not fond of the partial listing  plus the full listing below.  But, I'm too lazy to do much about it so I won't complain. :-)  [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 04:44, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

The IT Bookshelf has been massacred!  Books are missing and whole sections are gone.  I'm going to try and clean it up a little bit, but I need another set of eyes to try and figure out what happened.  I'm not talking just stuff moved to the new Computer Science bookshelf, but stuff that was supposedly moved there has not been moved but simply deleted.  I'll see what can be done, and somebody else check over what I've done [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:38, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)
:I found out where everything went.  There was a separate bookshelf just for Computer Science.  I was trying to find where some of the books went that were previously on the front page for the IT bookshelf, and somewhat legitimately it was missing.  I created a template for the front page that deals with just Computer Science, and put back some of the books that were there, as well as the broad categories that were previously deleted due to the reorganization.  On the whole, I think it has turned out pretty well, and something long overdue.  Thanks is due to User Darklama for doing most of the heavy lifting.  I did, however, put Computer Programming languages back into this bookshelf, at least until it legitimately deserves its own totally separate spot on the front page... or until a substantial reorganization of the front page occurs somehow.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:00, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

== why all the computer sections ==
Why all the computer sections?  I would like to contribute some of my knowledge, but the whole situation seems far too disorganized.

Is there a good reason why there are three? [[Computing bookshelf]], [[Computer Science bookshelf]] and [[IT bookshelf]]. (unknown)

* I'm wondering about the same myself. What about merging them? --[[User:Orderud|Orderud]] 10:58, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

I don't think we need to merge the three book shelves. Here's what an ideal organization would be:
# Computer Science -- the more &quot;math-like&quot; stuff you would get in college
# Programming -- language guides, library tutorials, programming tips and recipies
# IT -- about computer programs, using them, set up of networks, so long as you aren't writing much &quot;code&quot;
That's just my two cents, but the differences between CS and IT are so great that they shouldn't belong on the same shelf.

For example, a programming guide to the Python language would not be considered &quot;computer science&quot; unless perhaps it was really an intro book teaching programming (that just happened to use Python) or it was actually an advanced book teaching some other CS concept. Thus, there is a need to split CS with Programming (because, similarly, a guide to the MFC library is not a computer science topic either, in as much as a manual for repairing a car does not count as Physics). Further, a guide to using Photoshop wouldn't be considered programming nor computer science, so we need an IT shelf.

== Merging with [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] ==
:''This discussion was copied to here from [[Talk:Serial communications bookshelf]].''

See also [[Talk:Programming:Serial Data Communications]]

This is a bookshelf, not a Wikibook.  It isn't my fault that the rest of the Wikibooks on this bookshelf are dead and not making any progress.  IMHO, get rid of the merge request and let this bookshelf stay quiet or merge it somehow into the Computer Science bookshelf.  This is just a Wikibook organizational tool.  Considering that this bookshelf has stayed more stable for the past several months while the Computer Science bookshelf has been heavily modified and broken off from the Information Technology bookshelf with other massive reorganizations goes to show that perhaps this bookshelf is needed anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:09, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:Oops... I admit not reading enough of the material to check if this was a good merge. I only assumed that all pages called &quot;Serial Programming:...&quot; were part of [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] because [[Serial Programming]] is currently a redirect there. I forgot that some stuff is not using [[WB:NC]]/[[WB:NP]].

:It seems that this page is a list of books, like [[Physics]]. So merging the books into another book (even if that book has chapters starting with &quot;Serial Programming:...&quot;) is a bad idea. I will be removing the merge notices soon. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:19, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

:I would like to suggest instead that someone changes the [[Serial Programming]] redirect to go to this module. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:24, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Merged into IT bookshelf ===
I decided to put these books in a &quot;Serial Communications&quot; section of the existing &quot;Hardware&quot; section of the IT bookshelf. These books are about programming (so they could be put on Computer Science bookshelf too) but they are also about hardware. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:29, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

==Criticism - Kernel Guide or System Guide==
It is of course rather strange to want to make a book about a kernel that contains &quot;installation&quot; and &quot;for users&quot;. It probably comes from what makes people somehow unable to grasp that the huge vague collection of entities that they are trying to call by name does not have one.

The Book of Linux would be about a kernel, Book of GNU would be about a project, vision and a sort of a toolkit, Book of Debian would be about an organization, a view, a software distribution and the policy that looms over them, Book of Redhat would be about a company and its product family etc.  Trying to cram fragments of each and more under a single umberella will most likely not result in anything very good. Better than nothing, perhaps, but possibly something damaging.  --[[User:Blades|Blades]] 23:06, 10 May 2004 (UTC)

:Hardly. Linux is commonly used to refer to Linux systems, i.e. computing environments based on the Linux kernel. Not that difficult to understand, or that new a concept. And certainly a book about Linux would be useful, as essentially everything one would write in it would apply to all distros, as well as other UNIXes. Have you been to a bookstore recently? You'll find plenty of titles on &quot;Linux,&quot; and very very few of them are about a kernel. Maybe you should take up your point with all the world's publishers, or every Linux user &amp;mdash; I don't think you'll change many minds.

:Of course, I think this Wikibook needs reorganizing, but your essential point is nonsense.
:--[[User:Daniel|Daniel]] 09:58, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

::Of course there are. And people doing things in a stupid or false way does not make those ways any bit less stupid or wrong. My last sentence, quite especially is the essential point. I repeat:  ''Trying to cram fragments of each and more under a single umberella will most likely not result in anything very good. Better than nothing, perhaps, but possibly something damaging.''

::Book of Unix and GNU environments would make sense, though, and there should be a good one. Something like an old Altos SysV manual I have that explains what a user will experience, needs to understand, and will be able to do with a ready Unix system. It describes logins, files, file system, services available and the main tools, editors and finally sh, awk, and sed. These would have much in common in Unix and GNU systems. It would be both correct and very useful.

::Of course there is also the slightly better aimed term of &quot;Linux distribution&quot; which is also covers a staggering variety of wildly different concepts and units. Still, the essential point above remains.

::This is of course merely an informed opinion and not a mandate or complaint or anything such. Here appears to be a chance to do either something correct or something incorrect. By all means do create more incorrect books and justify it with following market lemmings. Many people will quite possibly be happy about it. Other could not care less. Some people will meet both the possible good and the possible bad results of people using this text.

::I just believe this point did need to be brought up, so I did.  --[[User:Blades|Blades]] 12:06, 11 May 2004 (UTC)

:::The core Linux developers, active for well over a decade, have always used &quot;Linux&quot; as it is commonly used by book publishers today. They do not subscribe to the political nonsense being forced down our throats by Richard Stallman via his bloated ''uname'' and ''autoconf'' tools. It is tradtional for the kernel name and operating system name to be one and the same. This situation is not unusual in the English language. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:::While I must concur with [[User:Blades|Blades]], I think that most &quot;Linux&quot; users know the signficance and distinction between the output of `uname -o` and `uname -s`.  Frankly, I think this book (at least in its current form) serves to benefit beginning users or those considering GNU/Linux, who likely are only aware of &quot;Linux&quot;.  I'd make a comment about this in the article, but I'd retain the title given the name recognition.

:::Lastly, given a target audience of beginning users or those still in consideration, the multifaceted nature of the current page is acceptable; however it should be noted that this is a mere generalized introduction targeted to those users.  The article in its current form is hardly a &quot;compendium&quot;, but that may be rectified with time.
:::--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 18:20, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::Note that &quot;uname -o&quot; was created to push Richard Stallman's political ideas. It serves no other purpose. It is not part of any standard. The latest UNIX and POSIX standard (IEEE, Open Group, and ISO) has &quot;uname -s&quot; though, which is required to report &quot;the name of the implementation of the operating system&quot;. So, let there be no doubt, &quot;Linux&quot; is &quot;the name of the implementation of the operating system&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:39, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:More than a year later, Wikibooks has books about Linux system installation ([[Installing Linux]]) and new users ([[Linux For Newbies]]), but not much for the kernel ([[Updating the Linux kernel]], [[Guide to UNIX/Linux]]). Some other stuff about the Linux and GNU environments is in [[Guide to UNIX]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:34, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

::Of course not. The kernel is a fast-moving target that is documented already in the source itself, in the Documentation directory included with the source, in BitKeeper and git change log entries, and in release announcement emails. Mailing lists, searchable via Google, fill in the rest. No wikibooks project could ever hope to keep up with the kernel as it changes.

What's the point of having this when there's the Guide to Unix?


==Is it any good?==
Hi there i am just wondering what is linux like i have never actually used linux before i am just wondering is it good or not because like i say i have never actually used the system before????? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:202.169.201.17|202.169.201.17]] ([[User talk:202.169.201.17|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.169.201.17|contribs]]) 2008-01-30T17:08:49&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Perhaps you should have a read of this book: [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]].

:Virtualization is another option. It is basically running an operating system inside another.  Vmware's products, Virtualbox, Xen, Qemu are all examples of software that does this. Slightly more technical, though. Searching Wikibooks, Wikipedia, and Google will provide useful info.--[[User:Jats|Jats]] ([[User talk:Jats|talk]]) 03:12, 28 February 2009 (UTC)
:'Is it any good?' well, for what? It probably isn't going to help you get a tire changed on the side of a mountain. Cordon Bleu isn't very good as rocket fuel either. I know people who won't run Linux anywhere that they are aware of, and others who won't run anything but Linux anywhere they can. If you're looking for a computer operating system that supports a wide variety of hardware, though possibly not everything in your current computer, then Linux is pretty good. If you're looking for something else, then you probably want to look somewhere else as well. I'm personally quite happy to use Linux for most of my computing needs. But that's me. Where your needs differ, Linux may not be a good match. Try,  take a look at the things that are available, that perhaps you never even considered using your computer for, look through the equivalences pages and who knows you might find yourself happy with it. If you don't, most of us are OK with that too.--[[User:rusty0101|Rusty]]</text>

In addition to the basic control structures, Perl allows the use of statement modifiers. The statement modifier is placed at the end of the statement that it modifies.  Note that the &lt;code&gt;do {} until&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;do {} while&lt;/code&gt; loop constructs are actually statement modifiers. The complete list of modifiers is:

* ''statement'' '''if''' ''expression''
* ''statement'' '''unless''' ''expression''
* ''statement'' '''while''' ''expression''
* ''statement'' '''until''' ''expression''
* ''statement'' '''foreach''' ''list''

Unlike BASIC-PLUS, statement modifiers in Perl cannot be stacked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;P&gt;There may be a need for a team interpreter due to length of assignment, complexity of material, pacing of speaker, multiple speakers, working with a Deaf-Blind consumer, or a need to copy sign questions from the audience. Ideally you should choose an interpreter you have worked with before, feel comfortable with and supported by.  Prepare with your team mate before the event, if possible, or meet at some point to compare notes.  If you are the interpreter for the general deaf audience and there is an Deaf interpreter for a Deaf-Blind consumer, you or your team mate may have to keep an eye on the Deaf interpreter's need for a repetition or clarification.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Preparation&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;How much preparation you do for an assignment will depend on the challenges it presents to you personally, as well as the realistic time constraints and the nature of the assignment,  Decide how to split up the prep and share what each of you have found out later.  To get accustomed to the style of the presenter, the following options are open to you in descending order of preference.  If the presenter is deaf: (1) watch a videotape of the presenter on the same topic, (2) watch a videotape of the presenter on a different topic, (3) watch a videotape of a different deaf presenter on the same topic.  If the presenter is hearing; (1) listen to a tape (audio or video) of the presenter on the same topic, (2) listen to a tape of the presenter on a different topic, (3) listen to a tape of a different hearing presenter on the same topic.

&lt;P&gt;If no tapes are available, or if the assignment is an ongoing one, you may wish to find something written on the topic, especially by the presenter you will interpret for.  Other written resources are encyclopedia articles, glossaries, articles from periodicals, or information from the World Wide Web. 
If an article is too lengthy, reading only the topic sentences (first sentence of every paragraph) may be helpful. Hearing and deaf people that are knowledgeable about the topic can supply you with good sign/word choices for the target language, as well as explain the meaning of the concepts in the source language.  If this is an ongoing event, notes from the previous sessions will give clearer context.  

&lt;P&gt;Even a brief meeting between the principal speaker and the team interpreters, if at all possible, will give needed information and build trust with the presenter.  Request copies of any handouts, overheads, or lecture notes.  Find out what media will be used (movies, videotapes, PowerPoint, and so one) to determine placement and lighting needs. If you don't have time to read them, at least your team mate can feed you and prepare for her/his turn.  Ask the presenter what the overall goal and major points are.  Do any consumer education you feel is warranted. The team interpreters should also meet 10-15 minutes before the event.  Your situation may not require all of the items below.  However, be aware of them and keep them in mind when you are teaming.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Placement - English to ASL&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;You the interpreter will stand in a place that allows the Deaf audience to see the information: overheads, PowerPoint presentations, films, maps, and other media.  Where will your team mate be?  Some people have the team mate sit side-by-side, even for English to ASL.  It seems to me that there should be some distance between the two so that your team mate can see what you are signing and feed you short bits of information without too much distraction.  However the deaf people's eyes will naturally turn to whoever is signing, so perhaps a philosophy of open processing would be appropriate.  

&lt;P&gt;Open processing means that if the team mate understands what was said but you don't or have misunderstood and consequently missigned a large portion of what was said, the team mate chimes in and takes over for that short portion.  You might even want your team mate to continue if you find that you don't understand because of topic change, the audience member has a thick accent, or some other factor. If everyone is sitting at a table, the interpreters could sit almost side-by-side, with perhaps one seat in between for them to see each other comfortably.  When it comes time to switch, no one has to move.  The deaf person merely switches his/her gaze.  

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Placement - ASL to English&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;You no longer need to stand close to the visual information and will now sit.  It makes sense to sit side-by-side, since your team mate does not need to see you and can also whisper the feed (&lt;I&gt;chucotage&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;sotte voce&lt;/I&gt;). It is now possible for there to be long feeds that are taken up by you and said in normal volume.  You can always turn the interpretation over to your team mate if you feel that the feed will be lengthy, or they seem to have a better handle on the signer.  I wonder how this works for the hearing audience.  Deaf people have become so tolerant of the needs of interpreters to switch off, wait for full understanding of a text, and even interpret what the interpreter is trying to say, that these sorts of bumps in the interpretation hardly jar them any more.  I know if I were listening to a spoken interpretation of, say, a Russian speaker and another voice chimed in, I would be thrown off, but maybe we all have to get used to such a thing.  When there is no microphone but the room is fairly large, it may be beneficial for the interpreters to stand behind the entire audience so that the audience can hear them.   

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Signaling&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;How will you signal when you need help? How will your partner signal?  Some ways to signal are: eye gaze (I tell my team mate I will never look at them unless I need help), puzzled look, raised eyebrows/wide eyes for teamed English to ASL; whispered need, touch on your partner's shoulder or arm (check first), or leaning towards your partner for ASL to English. Some things an interpreter may need to signal for: missed a word/sign, what was that fingerspelling, I know the word but how do you spell it, what does that word/sign/phrase/sentence/concept mean, something non-verbal just happened that I missed, or what's the sign/word for that?  Plan quick and unobtrusive ways to ask your partner for these things. 

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Feeding&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Some &quot;team&quot; interpreters think they are just there to wait for their turn.  I have been guilty myself of trying to work on projects while being part of a team.  Make sure that your team mate says s/he is fine without feeding before you bring out that book or laptop.  Where will each of you be to allow for ease of feeding and smooth turn-taking?  How do you want your partner to feed you missed information?  How does your partner want to be feed? Can you volunteer missed or misunderstood information, even if not asked for it? Some ways to feed: in ASL, in English-influenced ASL (contact language), or with mouthing. What do you want your partner to be particularly attentive to, that is, what do you generally need help with?  Some examples: fingerspelled information, numbers, proper names, or the big picture (the text or gestalt).

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Team mate's responsibilities&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;There are many names for the team interpreter who is not at present signing or speaking the interpretation: feed interpreter, down interpreter, off interpreter, cold-seat interpreter, the non-working interpreter (if things are going properly that is a misnomer!).  All of these have advantages and drawbacks. For the purposes of this paper, I will simply say your team mate and &quot;you&quot; will mean the on interpreter, working interpreter, up interpreter, hot-seat interpreter, what have you, unless otherwise specified.  

&lt;P&gt;Your team mate may need to take care of various things that come up, besides feeding you.  These may include: fixing the lighting, changing a distracting background, getting the handouts, bringing water, adjusting the microphone, or what to do about audiovisuals.  (Help!  They just turned off all the lights!)

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Continuity and turn-taking&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;What happens when one interpreter's style/language variation is markedly different from the others? Suppose you choose one way of expressing a concept and your team mate believes there's a better way to handle it or that the interpretation needs to be more English or more ASL. Do you both continue to interpret without making any adjustments to your style or choices? How often will you replace each other? It's important to negotiate. Try to use what your team mate has set up in terms of spatialization and sign negotiations. The method of spelling or replacement is an issue that will also allow for continuity if it is done properly.  The best method is to decide on the approximate time that you will replace each other, such as every 20 minutes.  When the time arrives, the team mate should let you know that it is time, because you will be too busy interpreting to check your watch and it looks rather tacky to check your watch anyway.  

&lt;P&gt;If the interpreters are positioned very close to one another, the team mate can simply walk up to the interpreter when it seems that an idea has been completed or when it seems there will be a considerable pause.  The interpreter can stand up or move out of place if already standing and the team mate can take her/his place.  If it is hard to tell when the speaker will pause because they don't tend to pause in their speech, the team mate can signal to the interpreter TIME+ and then the interpreter will simple leave when they feel they can or simply at some random time if there never is a &quot;good time&quot;.  In a formal stage event, the team mate can come up behind the interpreter from the wings, tap the interpreter on the back and move back slightly, remaining behind the interpreter and wait for the interpreter to walk away.

&lt;P&gt;Turn-taking can become more complex if there are many deaf people and they are interacting with each other.  This is because we need to see each person fully and can't rely on our hearing to jump from one speaker to another.  If there will be a lot of this, it is better for the interpreters to take every other speaker.  This allows the hearing audience to hear that there has been a change of speakers and allows the interpreters to see the full comment even when the next signer is far away or interrupting.  If there is someone who is doing most of the signing, one interpreter can take this person during their &quot;turn&quot; and the team mate will take the next signer who will presumably not take as much time.  If a third signer chimes in before the leader responds, the teacher's interpreter will also have to interpret this signer.  It can be somewhat confusing but simply identify a change of speaker's if one interpreter ends up doing two people in a row. 

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Debriefing during the assignment and after&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Use a notebook or piece of paper to communicate to each other during the assignment.  Your team mate can write down comments while you are up and vice versa.  You can comment on items that this paper identifies if you forgot to mention something during your pre-meeting that you would like your team mate to do. Remember to also give each other a pat on the back for things that were done especially well.  Remember to share the total interpretation, rather than play the game of one-upmanship.  Don't feel insulted if you are being feed something; that's why your team mate is there.  If you are the feeder and the interpreter doesn't accept your feed, don't feel rejected.  Perhaps they weren't able to incorporate it, or weren't sure what you meant.  Do work together. One of the stickiest problems is what you do if you are in an on-going assignment that you find does not need two interpreters because there is so much unexpected down-time due to independent student work?  The ideal would be if each of you could take every other class or one person take the whole thing because the other is confident of finding other work.  I leave this as a moral exercise for the reader. 

&lt;P&gt;Have a post-meeting, even if it's short, to sum up how things went. It's important to find out what worked and didn't work for you and your partner. I'm sure you have had the experience of coming up with just the right thing to say or do &lt;U&gt;after&lt;/U&gt; it's too late. This doesn't have to be a frustration.  Brainstorm solutions for problems that occurred and use them next time you encounter a similar situation. Use the same tact you would use with your consumers to deal with differences of opinion.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Deaf-Hearing teams&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Don't forget to consider a Deaf interpreter (CDI) as a team mate, especially in such situations as: (1) ASL-English if the CDI's voice is sufficiently understandable, (2) Deaf-Blind, (3) legal, (4) mental health, (5) High Visual Orientation (previously called Minimal Language Skills), (6) International Gesture, and (7) shadow interpreting for audience visibility.  Some Hearing interpreters feel funny if they have a Deaf interpreter with them, because it looks like they can't do their job alone, and they may feel the Deaf person is looking them over.  Well, sometimes we can't do our job alone and that's okay.  We should strive to be able to survive scrutiny by CDIs or other interpreters.

&lt;P&gt;Interpreters need to feel a part of the team.  The CDI should not take the tact of &quot;Oh, that interpreter doesn't understand you.  Let's talk and then I'll tell them what you said.&quot;  Instead the CDI should act as a facilitator of communication and allow the Hearing interpreter to be &quot;in on&quot; the communication.  It's true that the hearing interpreter still won't feel the client rapport that would exist if s/he was working alone.  Maybe that's life.

&lt;P&gt;The most interesting Deaf-Hearing team I have worked on is one where I did very little and yet benefitted markedly.  I went to a Deaf &lt;I&gt;Shabbaton&lt;/I&gt; where many Deaf people came to a Hearing synagogue and participated in a Jewish &lt;I&gt;Shabbat&lt;/I&gt; (Sabbath) service.  Afterwards there was a dinner mainly for the Deaf guests with interested hearing people also attending.  For the service, one of the Deaf participants was a Deaf Israeli who knew English, ASL, and &lt;I&gt;Shasi&lt;/I&gt; (Israeli Sign Language).  The Jewish service is scripted, that is everyone reads from the &lt;I&gt;siddur&lt;/I&gt; (prayerbook), sometimes aloud, sometimes to oneself.  I sat in the congregation and signed the beginning of each new section to the Deaf interpreter, who then read the Hebrew and interpreted it into ASL.  I would still sign the beginning of new sections to the interpreter so he could keep pace with the &lt;I&gt;sh'lach tsibbur&lt;/I&gt; (prayer leader).  I benefited greatly beacuse I got to see someone who was fluent in Hebrew give his take on how the ideas of the text could be communicated into ASL.  Hope your career will also team (teem) with blessings!

==Introduction to Bonding==
Put simply, '''chemical bonding''' join atoms together to form more complex structures (like molecules or crystals). Bonds can form between atoms of the same element, or between atoms of different elements. There are several types of chemical bonding which have different properties and give rise to different structures.

In many cases, atoms try to react to form valence shells containing eight electrons. The ''octet rule'' describes this, but it also has many exceptions

{{TextBox|1=
*'''[[General Chemistry/Ionic bonding|Ionic bonding]]''' occurs between positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions). In an ionic solid, the ions arrange themselves into a rigid crystal lattice. NaCl (common salt) is an example of an ionic substance.  In ionic bonding there is an attractive force established between large numbers of positive cations and negative anions, such that a neutral lattice is formed.  This attraction between oppositely-charged ions is collective in nature and called ionic bonding.

*'''[[General Chemistry/Covalent bonds|Covalent bonds]]''' are formed when the orbitals of two non-metal atoms physically overlap and share electrons with each other. There are two types of structures to which this can give rise: molecules and covalent network solids. Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) are examples of covalently bonded molecules, and glass is a covalent network solid.

*'''[[General Chemistry/Metallic bonds|Metallic bonding]]''' occur between atoms that have few electrons compared to the number of accessible orbitals. This is true for the vast majority of chemical elements. In a metallically bonded substance, the atoms' outer electrons are able to freely move around - they are delocalised to form an 'electron pool'. Iron is a metallically bonded substance.}}

Chemical bonding is one of the most crucial concepts in the study of chemistry. In fact, the properties of materials are basically defined by the type and number of atoms they contain and how they are bonded together.

So far, you have seen examples of '''intramolecular bonds'''.  These bonds connect atoms into molecules or whole crystals.  There are also '''[[General Chemistry/Intermolecular bonds|intermolecular bonds]]''' that connect molecules into large substances.  Sometimes, there is no difference between intramolecular and intermolecular bonds.  In the case of ionic crystals (like salt) or covalent networks (like diamond), the same bonding forces connect all of the atoms together.  In the case of metallic bonding, the atoms are all interconnected into one large piece of metal.

On the other hand, there may be intermolecular bonds different from those that join atoms into molecules.  Intermolecular bonds hold individual molecules of water into a puddle, and they are broken when the water boils into a gas.

==What are ions?==
'''Ions''' are atoms or molecules which are electrically charged. '''Cations''' are positively charged and '''anions''' carry a negative charge. Ions form when atoms gain or lose electrons. Since electrons are negatively charged, an atom that loses one or more electrons will become positively charged; an atom that gains one or more electrons becomes negatively charged.

==Description of Ionic Bonding==
Ionic bonding is the attraction between positively- and negatively-charged '''ions'''. These oppositely charged ions attract each other to form ionic networks (or lattices). Electrostatics explains why this happens: opposite charges attract and like charges repel. When many ions attract each other, they form large, ordered, crystal lattices in which each ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge. Generally, when metals react with non-metals, electrons are transferred from the metals to the non-metals. The metals form positively-charged ions and the non-metals form negatively-charged ions. The smallest unit of an ionic compound is the '''formula unit''', but this unit merely reflects that ratio of ions that leads to neutrality of the whole crystal, e.g. NaCl or MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. One cannot distinguish individual NaCl or MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules in the structure. 

It is however possible that the stacking consists of molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; in ammonium nitrate. In such structures the ions are charged molecules rather than charged atoms.

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;

|}
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Characteristics==
Example ionic compounds: Sodium chloride (&lt;math&gt;NaCl&lt;/math&gt;), potassium nitrate (&lt;math&gt;KNO_3&lt;/math&gt;).

Ionically bonded substances typically have the following characteristics.

*High melting point (solid at room temperature)
*Hard but brittle (can shatter)
*Many dissolve in water
*Conductors of electricity when dissolved or melted

In general the forces keeping the lattice together depend on the product of the charges of the ions it consists of. A comparison e.g. of NaCl (+1)*(-1) to MgO (+2)*(-2) shows that magnesium oxide is kept together much more strongly -roughly 4 times- than sodium chloride. This is why sodium chloride has a much lower melting point and also dissolves much more easily in a solvent like water than magnesium oxide does.

==Formation==
[[Image:NaCl_ionic.png|thumb|The electron transfer between Na and Cl.]]
Ionic bonding occurs when metals and non-metals chemically react. As a result of its low ionization energy, a metal atom is not destabilized very much if it loses electrons to form a complete valence shell and becomes positively charged. As its affinity is rather large, a non-metal is stabilized rather strongly by gaining electrons to complete its valence shell and become negatively charged. When metals and non-metals react, the metals lose electrons by transferring them to the non-metals, which gain them. The total process -a small loss plus a large gain- leads to a net lowering of the energy. Consequently, ions are formed, which instantly attract each other leading to ionic bonding.

For instance, in the reaction of Na (sodium) and Cl (chlorine), each Cl atom takes one electron from a Na atom. Therefore each Na becomes a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation and each Cl atom becomes a Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Due to their opposite charges, they attract each other and are joined by millions and millions of other ions to form an ionic lattice. The lattice energy that results from this massive collective stacking further stabilizes the new compound. The formula (ratio of positive to negative ions) in the lattice is '''NaCl''', i.e. there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges ensuring neutrality.

The charges ''must'' balance because otherwise the repulsion between the majority charges would become prohibitive.  In the case of magnesium chloride, the magnesium atom gives up two electrons to become stable.  Note that it is in the second group, so it has two valence electrons.  The chlorine atom can only accept one electron, so there must be two chlorine ions for each magnesium ion.  Therefore, the formula for magnesium chloride is '''MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  If magnesium oxide were forming, the formula would be '''MgO''' because oxygen can accept both of magnesium's electrons.

{{TextBox|1=
;Exercise for the reader
Try figuring out what the formula for [[w:Magnesium_nitride|magnesium nitride]] would be.  Use the [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table]] to help.}}

It should also be noted that some atoms can form more than one ion. This usually happens with the transition metals.  For instance Fe (iron) can become Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (called iron(&lt;tt&gt;II&lt;/tt&gt;) or -by an older name- ferrous). Fe can ''also'' become Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (called iron(&lt;tt&gt;III&lt;/tt&gt;) or -sometimes still- ferric).

==Common Ions==
Ionic bonding typically occurs in reactions between a metal and non-metal, but there are also certain molecules called ''polyatomic ions'' that undergo ionic bonding.  Within these polyatomic ions, there can be covalent (or polar) bonding, but as a unit it undergoes ionic bonding.  There are countless polyatomic ions, but you should be familiar with the most common ones.  You would be well advised to memorize these ions.

Current Development Stage for '''Ada Programming''' is &quot;{{stage|75%|Feb 26, 2012}}&quot;. At this date, there are more than 200 pages in this book, which makes '''Ada Programming''' one of the largest [[Computer programming|programming]] wikibooks.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats], [[:Category:Ada Programming]] or [[/All Chapters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

But still there is always room for improvement &amp;mdash; do help us to expand '''Ada Programming'''. Even beginners will find areas to participate.

== About Ada ==
{{Wikipedia|Ada (programming language)}}
Ada is a programming language suitable for all development needs.
It has built-in features that directly support [[w:Structured programming|structured]],
[[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], [[w:Generic programming|generic]], [[w:Distributed computing|distributed]] and [[w:Concurrent computing|concurrent]] programming.

Ada is a good choice for [[w:Rapid_application_development|Rapid Application Development]], [[w:Extreme_Programming|Extreme Programming (XP)]],
and [[w:Free Software|Free Software]] development.

Ada is named after [[w:Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada King]], Countess of Lovelace.

=== Programming in the large ===

Ada puts unique emphasis on, and provides strong support for, good [[w:Software Engineering|software engineering]] practices that scale well to very large software
systems (millions of lines of code, and very large development teams).  The following
language features are particularly relevant in this respect:

* An extremely strong, static and safe '''[[w:Type system|type system]]''', which allows the programmer to construct powerful abstractions that reflect the real world, and allows the compiler to detect many logic faults before they become errors.
* '''[[w:Modularity (programming)|Modularity]]''', whereby the compiler directly manages the construction of very large software systems from sources.
* '''[[w:Information hiding|Information hiding]]'''; the language separates interfaces from implementation, and provides fine-grained control over visibility.
* '''Readability''', which helps programmers review and verify code.  Ada favours the reader of the program over the writer, because a program is written once but read many times.  For example, the syntax bans all ambiguous constructs, so there are no surprises, in accordance with the Tao of Programming's [[w:Principle_of_least_astonishment|Law of Least Astonishment]].  (Some Ada programmers are reluctant to talk about ''source code'' which is often cryptic; they prefer ''program text'' which is close to English prose.)
* '''[[w:Write once, compile anywhere|Portability]]''': the language definition allows compilers to differ only in a few controlled ways, and otherwise defines the semantics of programs very precisely; as a result, Ada source text is very portable across compilers and across target hardware platforms.  Most often, the program can be recompiled without any changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

* '''Standardisation''': standards have been a goal and a prominent feature ever since the design of the language in the late 1970s.  The first standard was published in 1980, just 3 years after design commenced.  Ada compilers all support exactly the same language; the only dialect, [[w:SPARK_%28programming_language%29|SPARK]], is merely an annotated subset and can be compiled with an Ada compiler.

Consequences of these qualities are superior '''reliability''', '''reusability''' and
'''maintainability'''. For example, compared to programs written in [[Programming:C|C]],
programs written in Ada&amp;nbsp;83 contain ''&quot;70% fewer internal fixes and 90% fewer bugs&quot;'', and cost half as much to develop in the first place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper
 |     author = Stephen F. Zeigler
 |      title = Comparing Development Costs of C and Ada

 | accessdate = 2009-01-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ada shines even more in software maintenance, which often accounts for about 80% of the total
cost of development.  With support for object-oriented programming, Ada 95 may bring even
more cost benefit, depending on how objects are used; although no serious study comparable to Zeigler's has been published.

=== Programming in the small ===

In addition to its support for good software engineering practices,
which are applicable to general-purpose programming, Ada has powerful
specialised features supporting '''low-level programming''' for real-time, safety-critical
and [[w:Embedded system|embedded]] systems.  Such features include, among others,
machine code insertions, address arithmetic, low-level access to memory, control over bitwise representation of data, bit manipulations, and
a well-defined, statically provable concurrent computing model called the
[[w:Ravenscar profile|Ravenscar Profile]].

Other features include restrictions (it is possible to restrict which language
features are accepted in a program) and features that help review and certify
the object code generated by the compiler.

Several vendors provide Ada compilers accompanied by minimal run-time kernels
suitable for use in certified, life-critical applications.  It is also possible to
write Ada programs which require no run-time kernel at all.

It should come as no surprise that Ada is heavily used in the aerospace, defence,
medical, railroad, and nuclear industries.

=== The Language Reference Manual ===
{{Wikipedia|ISO 8652}}
The Ada Reference Manual (RM) is the official language definition. If you have a problem and no one else can help, you should read the RM &lt;small&gt;(albeit often a bit cryptic for non-language-lawyers)&lt;/small&gt;. For this reason, all complete &lt;small&gt;(not draft)&lt;/small&gt; pages in '''Ada Programming''' contain links into the appropriate pages in the RM.

This tutorial covers ''[[w:ISO 8652|Ada Reference Manual &amp;mdash; ISO/IEC 8652:2012(E) Language and Standard Libraries]]'', colloquially known as ''Ada&amp;nbsp;2012'' or just ''Ada''.

You can browse the complete Reference Manual at http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/12rm/html/RM-TTL.html

There are two companion documents:
* The [http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/12aarm/html/AA-TTL.html Annotated Reference Manual], an extended version of the RM aimed at compiler writers or other persons who want to know the fine details of the language.
* The [http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rationale12.html Rationale for Ada&amp;nbsp;2012], an explanation of the features of the language.

The [http://www.adaic.com/standards Ada Information Clearinghouse] also offers the older Ada&amp;nbsp;83, 95, and 2005 standards and companion documents.

The RM is a collective work under the control of Ada users.
If you think you've found a problem in the RM, please report it to
the [http://www.ada-auth.org Ada Conformity Assessment Authority]. On this site, you can also see the list of &quot;Ada Issues&quot; raised by other people.

=== Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite ===
{{Wikipedia|ISO 18009}}
Unlike other programming languages, Ada compilers are officially tested, and only those which pass this test are accepted, for military and commercial work. This means that all Ada compilers behave (almost) the same, so you do not have to learn any dialects. But because the Ada standard allows the compiler writers to include some additions, you could learn a cool new feature only to find out that your favourite compiler does not support it...

Beginning in the late 14th century, European explorers embarked on a series of expeditions of discovery and conquest. Some motivated by fabulous tales from the Orient, tales of riches, gold, and silver or stories about the oriental silk road available to Italian traders. Most intended in controlling the trade of those valuable exotic products, such as spices, silk.

Portugal's nautical exploration was not much about expansionism (conquest, control and new lands) but simple application of technology, curiosity and trade improvement. Nautical experience was already abundant in that region of the Iberian peninsula. Fishing, production of sea salt and its use in fish conservation had already linked the region to the Sea, even before the Roman occupation of the territory. Being a peninsula also meant that most commerce was done by Sea.

Territory control only started to become an issue after the involvement of the other powers, especially the competition from Spain. This becomes an active policy after the rise of the Aviz dynasty, [[w:John I of Portugal|John I of Portugal]] was a key figure in restoring the Portuguese independence from &quot;Spain&quot; (Castile). Due to the relation between Crowns and successions Portugal had become virtually annexed to Castile. It is with this bellicose separation from the control of Spain, that leads also to the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance that endures to the present day that trade expansion and secure navigational routes starts to gain importance to the Portuguese Crown, starting with the siege and conquest of the city of Ceuta in 1415, a failed attempt to secure a profitable trade route.

Portugal's Prince Henry the Navigator, who also studied sailing techniques pioneered by the Arabs when he helped Portugal conquer Northern Morocco. Later, Prince Henry founded a navigation school, where these techniques were quickly integrated into Portuguese vessels.

Prince Henry's dream was find a sea route to India around Africa, so Portuguese traders could bypass the Italian middlemen who had monopolized the Oriental luxury trade. Under his direction, Portuguese explorers explored much of the African coast, and established profitable trading posts in the Niger delta and further south in Angola. However, it was only after his death that the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and reached the Southern India's trading cities.

Within fifty years of da Gama's success, Portugal essentially controlled the Indian Ocean, with strategically located trading posts at Aden, Hormuz, and Malacca. After Portuguese ships defeated Egypt's navy, even the Mughal Empire of India was forced to acknowledge Portuguese domination. In return, the Muslim Mughals were allowed to send one pilgrim ship to Mecca each year without paying any fees to the Portuguese.

== Spain follows ==
As summed up by the Spanish explorers of the Americas as &quot;Gold, Glory, and God&quot;, were to amass great wealth by conquering indigenous peoples, to bring fame to their monarchs and themselves for their daring exploits, and to bring Christianity to the regions that they explored and exploited.

{{TODO|To understand Spain's motivations for exploration and expansion one needs to understand the context, partly motivated by a very religious devout Queen but also by the increased pressure and attrition with other nations.}}

== Spain disputes the New World ==
[[Image:CristobalColon.jpg|thumb|250px|Christopher Columbus]]
While Portugal set its sights on dominating the Indian Ocean, its neighboring country, Spain, also began to explore and seek colonies. While the new Spanish monarchs hoped to add the southern Kingdom of Granada to their rule, an enterprising Italian merchant named Columbus found his way to the Spanish court. He had previous experience sailing on Portuguese trade vessels in the Indian Ocean, and wanted to lead a voyage across the Atlantic to India and break the Portuguese trade monopoly. Contrary to popular belief, Columbus's proposal was not dismissed because most people thought the world was flat, but because most thought India was too far to reach without running out of food or getting stuck in windless regions. However, Isabella wisely decided to fund an expedition - after Spanish forces conquered Granada.

So, after a lengthy delay, Columbus set sail across the Atlantic with three vessels, the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria, all manned by convicts from Spanish jails. Columbus landed somewhere in the Bahamas, though he named the dark skinned inhabitants of the islands &quot;Indians&quot; because he thought that he had reached India. Columbus would embark on other expeditions throughout the Caribbean, though he never reached China as he had hoped. The Americas would later be named after Amerigo Vespucci, a fellow Italian explorer who argued, correctly, that Columbus had discovered a new land.

By the early 15th century, Spain controlled the largest Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. However, the native Carib and Arawak tribes did not posses the riches the Spanish explorers desired, although they did speak of a great kingdom on the mainland with immense treasures. Hernando Cortés, an adventurer who had gotten in trouble with the Spanish governor, believed the tales and mounted a modest expedition to find this kingdom. Cortés landed in Mexico, and quickly allied himself with local tribes who directed him inland to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. Moctezuma, the Aztec Emperor, received news of Cortés, but chose not to attack, believing Cortés to be the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, who had been driven away many years ago by the war god Huitzilopoctli. Moctezuma's hesitation allowed Cortés to enter the Aztec capital and to receive additional support from tribes opposed to the Aztecs. By the time the Aztecs realized that Cortés was preparing to attack, Moctezuma had already been taken hostage. Moctezuma, and many of the Spanish recruits in the expedition, was killed in the fighting, which only ended when Cortés razed Tenochtitlan. 

News of Cortés's success and wealth soon spread, with many more expeditions trying to emulate his success. Among the most successful were [[w:John Cabot|John Cabot]], [[w:Giovanni da Verrazano|Giovanni da Verrazano]], [[w:Francis Drake|Francis Drake]], [[w:Francisco Vasquez|Francisco Vasquez de Coronado]], [[w:Francisco Pizarro|Francisco Pizarro]], and [[w: David Wang/David Wang]]

==The Treaty of Tordesillas ==
By the end of the 16th century, Spain and Portugal dominated trade and territories in Asia and the Americas. Portugal controlled most of the Indian Ocean trade, as well as the spice plantations in Indonesia, while Spain controlled extensive parts of Central and South America. Fearing a war between the two rivals, the Pope helped negotiate the Treaty of Tordesillas, which essentially divided the world in half, with both countries receiving exclusive rights in their respective hemispheres.

==Other European Explorations==
England, France, and the Netherlands, refused to comply with the Treaty of Tordesillas and also began to explore and establish colonies in the Americas.

==English Colonies==

==French Colonies==

===New France===
France founded colonies in much of eastern North America, on a number of Caribbean islands,Asia, and in South America. Most colonies were developed to export products such as fish, sugar, and furs.
The French first came to the New World as explorers, seeking a route to the Pacific ocean and wealth. Major French exploration of North America began under the reign of King Francis I. In 1524, Francis sent Italian-born Giovanni da Verrazano to explore the region between Florida and Newfoundland for a route to the Pacific Ocean. Although he failed to find such a route, Verranzano became the first European to explore much of the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. Later, in 1534, Francis sent Jacques Cartier on the first of three voyages to explore the coast of Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence River.

In 1541 Cartier set of on another expedition, and established a colony named Charlesbourg-Royal, on the site of present-day Cap-Rouge, Quebec. Cartier continued to explore the region. He returned to Charlesbourg-Royal and found the colony struggling to survive, and after a tough winter, left for France in June of 1542. Charlesbourg-Royal was abandoned the following year. 

A second French attempt at establishing a North American colony came in 1562, when King Charles IX sent Jean Ribault and a group of Huguenot settlers to found a colony in North America. They explored the St. Johns River in what is now Jacksonville, Florida and attempted a failed colony at Parris Island, South Carolina, but eventually returned to the St. Johns, where Ribault's second in command René Goulaine de Laudonnière established Fort Caroline on June 22, 1564. In 1565 the Spanish attacked, and destroyed, the fort.

In 1603, Samuel de Champlain made his first trip to North America on a fur trading expedition. Champlain would prove instrumental in creating New France. In 1608, he created a fur trading post that would grow into the city of Quebec. The French ran into many bloody conflicts with the Iroquois Confederacy. Although the French claimed a large territory in Canada and the Great Lakes region, actual settlement of the area was limited.

New France began to grow south and west of the Great Lakes after 1673, when Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet canoed across present day Wisconsin via the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway to discover the Mississippi River. From here, they followed the river south to the mouth of the Arkansas River. Afraid that they were drawing too near to areas of Spanish influence, the explorers turned north in Arkansas and returned to the Great Lakes, this time via the Illinois and Chicago rivers through present day Chicago. 

Following the journey of Marquette and Jolliet, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle traveled the Mississippi to its delta, claiming the river's entire watershed for France in 1682 and naming the territory Louisiane in honor of Louis XIV. This gave France control of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains in addition to their holdings in the Great Lakes and Canada. In 1699 the first permanent settlement was founded, and New Orleans was founded in 1718. 

Following the French defeat in the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Paris of February 10, 1763, divided French territory on the North American continent between the British and the Spanish. The sole exception was the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the Canadian coast, retained as a fishing outpost. The islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon were France's only remaining possessions north of the Caribbean.

===West Indies===
French efforts at colonization began in 1538, when a group of French Jesuit refugees founded the town of Dieppe on St. Kitts. However, their colony was found and destroyed by the Spanish within a year. France did not attempt to colonize the Caribbean again in the 16th century, but established a number of colonies the following century.

The most important French colony was on the island of Hispaniola, present-day Haiti. 

===South America===
From 1555 to 1567, French Huguenots, under the leadership of vice-admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, made an attempt to establish the colony of France Antarctique in what is now Brazil, but were expelled. From 1612 to 1615, a second failed attempt was made in present-day São Luís, Brazil.

French Guiana was first settled by the French in 1604, although its earliest settlements were abandoned in the face of American Indian hostility and tropical diseases. The settlement of Cayenne was established in 1643, but was abandoned. It was re-established in the 1660s. Except for brief occupations by the English and Dutch in the 17th century, Guiana has remained under French rule ever since.

==Dutch Colonies==
===North America===
In 1602, the government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands chartered the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) with the mission of exploring it for a passage to the Indies and claiming any uncharted territories for the United Provinces.

The VOC's explorers soon led several significant expeditions. In 1609, English explorer Henry Hudson, working for the VOC, attempted to find a north west passage to the Indies. Instead he discovered and claimed for the VOC parts of the present-day United States and Canada and lent his name to the Hudson River and Hudson Bay. In 1614, Adriaen Block led an expedition to the lower Hudson in the Tyger, and then explored the East River aboard the Onrust, becoming the first known European to navigate the Hellegat.

After some early trading expeditions, the first Dutch settlement in the Americas was founded in 1615: Fort Nassau, on Castle Island in the Hudson, near present-day Albany. The settlement served mostly as a trade post for fur trade with the natives and was later replaced by Fort Oranje (English: Fort Orange) at present-day Albany. Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau.

The Dutch West India Company (WIC)was established in 1621. In 1626, Director-General of the WIC Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from Indians and started the construction of fort New Amsterdam. This was the begging of New Netherland. In the same year, another Fort Nassau (not the one near Albany) was built in the New Jersey area. A number of other settlements were founded in the area. In 1647 Peter Stuyvesant became Director-General of New Netherland. In 1655 New Sweden was captured by the Dutch, and a border dispute with England was resolved. 

In 1664, English troops under the command of the Duke of York and Albany attacked the New Netherland colony. Being greatly outnumbered and with little gunpowder or ammunition, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam, with Fort Orange following soon. New Amsterdam was renamed New York, Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany. The loss of the New Netherland led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War during 1665-1667. 

From 1673 to 1674, the territories were once again briefly captured by the Dutch in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, only to be returned to England at the Treaty of Westminster. In 1674, Dutch navy captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz also briefly captured two forts in the French colony of Acadia, which he claimed as the Dutch territory of New Holland. However, Aernoutsz's appointed administrator, John Rhoades, quickly lost control of the territory after Aernoutsz himself left for Curaçao to seek out new settlers, and with effective control of Acadia remaining in the hands of France.

===West Indies===
The Dutch established a base on St. Croix in 1625, the same year that the British did. French Protestants joined the Dutch but conflict with the British colony led to its abandonment before 1650. The Dutch established a settlement on Tortola in 1648 and later on Anegada and Virgin Gorda. The British took Tortola in 1672 and Anegada and Virgin Gorda in 1680.

Dutch colonization of Sint Maarten began in 1620 although the ownership of the island changed hands several times before 1648 , when it was permanently split between France and the Netherlands. The border between the two portions of the island continued to be modified periodically, before being set for good in 1816 .

Several other islands were captured and fortified to prevent Spanish attacks in the ongoing Dutch war for independence from Spain and to exploit timber and salt resources, among them being:Curaco, Saba, Sint Eustatius, Aruba and Bonaire.

The Netherlands made numerous attempts to colonize the island of Tobago in the 17th century. Each time, the settlements were destroyed by rival European powers. The longest occupation period was from 1628-1637 when it was destroyed by the Spanish.

===South America=== 
The European colony in Suriname was founded by the English in the 1650s by Lord Willoughby, the governor of Barbados. This colony was captured by the Dutch under Abraham Crijnsen during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. On July 31, 1667, by the Treaty of Breda the Dutch were offered New Netherland in exchange for their sugar factories on the coast of Suriname, but they declined. In 1683 Suriname was sold to the Dutch West India Company and came to be known as Dutch Guiana. The colony developed an agricultural economy based on African slavery. 

The Dutch West Indian Company built a fort in Guyana in 1616 on the Essequibo River. The Dutch traded with the Indian peoples and, as in Suriname, established sugar plantations worked by African slaves. While the coast remained under Dutch control, the English established plantations west of the Suriname River. Conflict between the two countries meant parts of the region changed hands a number of times, but by 1796 Britain had control of the region. The Netherlands ceded the colonies of Essequibo, Demerara, and Berbice to Britain in 1814.

From 1630 onward, the Dutch Republic came to control a small portion of Brazil, with their capital in Recife. The Dutch West India Company set up their headquarters in Recife. The governor, Johan Maurits invited artists and scientists to the colony to help promote Brazil and increase immigration. The Portuguese won a significant victory at the Second Battle of Guararapes in 1649. By 1654, the Dutch Republic had surrendered and returned control of all Brazilian land to the Portuguese. After the end of the First Anglo-Dutch War in may 1654, the Dutch Republic demanded that New Holland (Dutch Brazil) was given back to them. Under threat of an occupation of Lisbon and a reoccupation of North East Brazil, the Portuguese submitted to the demand of the Dutch. However, Johan de Witt didn't agreed and therefore New Holland was formally ceded to Portugal on August 6, 1661 through the Treaty of the Hague.

In 1600 , the Chilean city of Valdivia was conquered by Dutch pirate Sebastian de Cordes. He left the city after some months. Then in 1642 the VOC and the WIC sent a fleet of some ships to Chile to conquer the city of Valdivia and the goldmines of the Spanish. The expedition was conducted by Hendrik Brouwer, a Dutch general. In 1643 Brouwer conquered the island Chiloé and the city of Valdivia. After mutinying the crew returned to Brazil.

===Asia===
Starting in 1602, the VOC began to take over Portuguese possessions in the East Indies. The Portuguese settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one. Amboina was captured from the Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its objective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favorable monsoon winds.  The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan Coen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the Latin name for Holland, and which would become the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive out the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. Malacca finally succumbed in 1641 and after this event, the Dutch had full control of the spice and silk trade in the East Indies.

In India and Ceylon, the Dutch had taken over the Portuguese settlements of Colombo in 1656, Ceylon in 1658, Nagappattinam in 1662 and Cranganore and Cochin in 1662. Goa, the capital of the Portuguese Empire in the East, was attacked by the Dutch twice in 1603 and 1610, on both occasions unsuccessfully. While the Dutch were unable in four attempts to capture Macau from where Portugal monopolized the lucrative China-Japan trade, the Japanese shogunate's increasing suspicion of the intentions of the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent Sakoku policy, for two hundred years the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate in Japan, confined in 1639 to Hirado and then from 1641 at Deshima.

===Africa===
The first Cape settlement was built in 1652 by the Dutch East India Company as a re-supply point and way station for Dutch vessels on their way back and forth between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The support station gradually became a settler community, the forebears of the Afrikaners, a white ethnic group in South Africa. 

After the first settlers spread out around the Company station, nomadic white livestock farmers, or Trekboers, moved more widely afield, leaving the richer, but limited, farming lands of the coast for the drier interior tableland. There they contested still wider groups of Khoikhoi cattle herders for the best grazing lands. By 1700, the traditional Khoikhoi lifestyle of pastoralism had disappeared. 

Over the next few decades, the colony continued to expand, taking over the primitive African population. In 1795, France conquered the Netherlands. The British, fearing French control, moved to occupy the colony. In 1803 the colony was returned the French puppet state, the Batavian Republic, until war broke out again and Britain occupied the colony in 1806. It would not revert the Dutch control.

Starting in 1598, the Dutch began to establish forts on the gold coast in Africa. For the next 270 years, the Dutch fought for control of the colony against the British, Swedish and Portuguese. They succeeded in driving out the Portuguese and Swedish. However, in 1872 the Dutch and British governments came to an agreement, in which the British were to purchase the Dutch gold coast settlements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rhythm''' is, aside from melody, one of the most basic aspects of music, and definitely the fundamental. Many early forms of music consisted only of rhythm; examples being drumming, clapping and shouting to a rhythm. 
==Basic durations==
There are two systems for naming notes in the English language. Here, the American names are listed first and the European names are listed in parentheses. This book, for consistency's sake, will use the American names throughout.

The whole note is the longest unit we will consider in this book. Earlier music featured the breve, which is twice as long. (This is why the whole note is called the &quot;semibreve&quot; in Europe.) Each unit after that is half the length of the previous.

*Whole note (semibreve)
*Half note (minim)
*Quarter note (crotchet)
*Eighth note (quaver)
*Sixteenth note (semiquaver)
*Thirty-second note (demisemiquaver)
*Sixty-fourth note (hemidemisemiquaver)

There are even shorter notes, such as the 128th note (semihemidemisemiquaver), but they are absurdly short for ''most'' music; even 32nd notes are uncommon. However, there are rare situations where they are appropriate. One piece with such notes is the [[w:en:Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path&amp;eacute;tique Sonata]] by [[w:en:Ludwig van Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven]].

Music may also contain ''rests'', in which no note is played or sung.

[[Image:Notes.png]]

This image shows notes and rests, in order from longest to shortest.

==More on durations==

A staccatoed note is 'separated' from the other notes around it. Space is inserted between the notes by shortening the end of the note being played. Some musicians consider it to be &quot;short and detached&quot;, whereas others suggest that a staccatoed note is half its value. This is more a feature of articulation and style, rather than rhythm, but it has rhythmic bearing as playing staccato can often cause musicians to play out of [[w:en:tempo|tempo]]. Staccato is shown by a dot below or above the note.

A very short note is known as ''appoggiatura'' or ''acciaccatura''. They are both almost insignificantly short notes also known as &quot;grace notes&quot; for the purpose of expression. The shorter of the two is the acciaccatura. They are shown as shrunken eighth notes, with a score through the shorter and the longer having no such flourish. Common uses include on bagpipes as grace notes or on guitar for slides, string-bends and hammer-on/pull-offs.

A dotted note is 50% longer than the undotted version, i.e. a dotted half note would take 3 beats, lasting as long as three quarter notes tied together. A double-dotted note is 75% longer than the normal note, i.e. a double-dotted half note would take 3½ beats.

Do not confuse dotted notes with staccato notes. Dotted notes have a dot on the right side, while staccato notes have dots on the top or bottom.

[[Image:Dotted_vs_stacatto.png]]

==Time signatures==
Time signatures are the basic description for the feel of the rhythm; they define how to count the rhythm. They are also known as the meter. This is why one can listen to a piece and know what time signature it is in. It is like hearing Shakespeare and knowing how many syllables are in the lines and what meter it is in. By far the most common time signature is 4/4, the next most possibly being 3/4 (commonly associated with the waltz). A time signature is found at the first measure right after the clef and key signature.

It is made up of two parts. For all meters the top number gives the number of notes per measure and the bottom number gives the note type. The bottom number can be:
*1 - whole note (very rare)
*2 - half note (uncommon)
*4 - quarter note (extremely common)
*8 - eighth note (common in modern avant-garde music and much other non-western music)

The top number may also be any other power of 2, but they are rare. The bottom number is ''always'' a power of two.

The time signature 4/4 means there are four quarter notes in a measure; the time signature 3/4 means there are three quarter notes in a measure. The time signature 2/2 is, in a way, the same as 4/4. However, 2/2 has two beats per measure (each a half-note in length), while 4/4 has four beats per measure. Beats are usually accented in some way in a song, especially with percussion in popular music. Usually the thesis is accented, while the arsis is unaccented. Traditionally the thesis is the down-beat and the arsis is the up-beat. The terms down-beat and up-beat come from the movements the the director makes while conducting.

NB the Time Signature is not written as a fraction but instead as two numbers one on top of the other, with no line between.

We divide time signatures into three main types:
* simple (each beat is divided into its sub-beats)
* compound (notes are grouped together into beats by the type of sub-beat) 
* asymmetric (both duple and triple groupings for its notes)

Time signatures are classified by type (simple or compound) and sub-beat (duple or triple).

In simple meter, the beat is divided into sub-beats or subdivisions:
*1 - In simple duple meter the beat (this is the type of note specified by the bottom number in the signature) is divided into two sub-beats.
*2 - In simple triple meter the beat is divided into three sub-beats.
However, for compound meters, the  sub-beats are grouped into the beats by duples or triples:
*1 - In compound duple meter the notes are grouped into twos, these groups make up a whole beat. Example: 6/8, three beats each with two sub-beats.
*2 - In compound triple meter the notes are grouped into threes, these group make up a whole beat. Example: 6/8, two beats each with three sub-beats.

Asymmetric meters are a type of compound meter where beats are divided into duples and triples. In these the beat actually changes its length because the sub-beat is constant. Examples: 5/8, two beats; either the first with two sub-beats and the second with three, or the first with three sub-beats and the second with two. 7/8, three beats -- either 2, 2, 3; 2, 3, 2; or 3, 2, 2 (in sub-beats).

==Tempo==
Beats-per-minute (or BPM) indicate how fast a song is played. Each beat corresponds to one note of the type indicated by the bottom number in the key signature.  For example, a song with 60 BPM will have 60 beats in a minute, or one beat per second. A song in 4/4 time at 60 BPM will have 15 bars in a minute, with 4 beats per bar; one each quarter note. A song at 120 BPM will have 30 bars in a minute and 2 beats per second.  The number of beats per minute is usually specified at the beginning of a piece using one of two conventions.  The first is something like, &quot;M.M.=115&quot;.  M.M. stands for Mälzel's metronome.  ([[w:Johann Nepomuk Mälzel|Johann Nepomuk Mälzel]])  The other common notation is a picture of the note value receiving the beat, an equals sign (=), and the BPM.  Most musicians, even professionals, own and regularly use a metronome or drum machine for practicing or recording in order to ensure they play at the desired tempo.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of relationship that we assign to music intervals. A quick review of [[../Scales and Intervals|intervals]] might be helpful if you're approaching the subject for the first time. A dissonant interval can be described as being &quot;unstable&quot; or ''demanding treatment'' by resolving to a consonant interval. A consonant interval is one that is stable and does not demand treatment. However, dissonance in itself is not an undesirable thing; we use dissonance to provide the &quot;spice&quot; to music. Thus, there is a hierarchy of consonant and dissonant intervals. (Chords having dissonant intervals are themselves considered dissonant).

Note that this distinction depends entirely on musical context. As such, a sonority which is consonant in one context where it does not seem to demand resolution (say, major 2nds in a Debussy prelude) may sound harsh or out-of-place in a different context where it must be resolved (the same major 2nds in a Bach fugue). In this article, we will be using the terms &quot;consonant&quot; and &quot;dissonant&quot; as they are understood in common-practice tonal music, as is the tacit convention when speaking of consonance and dissonance in general.

==Consonant intervals in tonal music==
*The perfect fifth and the perfect octave are considered ''perfect consonances''. The unison is a consonance insofar as it can be considered an interval at all (many say it cannot).
*The major third and sixth, as well as the minor third and sixth, are ''imperfect consonances''.
*The perfect fourth is dissonant in some contexts but consonant in others (see below). Specifically, the perfect fourth is dissonant when it is formed with the bass note of any sonority.

==Dissonant intervals==
*The perfect fourth is considered dissonant in [[w:common practice period|common practice]] music when not supported by a lower third or fifth (but see below).
*Major and minor seconds, sevenths, and ninths are dissonant. Composer/theorist Vincent Persichetti, in his book ''Twentieth-Century Harmony'', classifies major 2nds, minor 7ths, and major 9ths as &quot;soft dissonances,&quot; whereas minor 2nds, major 7ths, and minor 9ths are &quot;sharp dissonances.&quot;
*The tritone (an augmented fourth or diminished fifth) is dissonant. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was known as ''diabolus in musica'' because the perfect fifth was considered to be a reflection of the divine, and the tritone falls just short of a perfect fifth. [Note for the advanced: Technically, it is not proper to refer to the diminished fifth as a &quot;tritone.&quot; The word &quot;tritone&quot; refers to &quot;three whole-tones,&quot; the distance represented by the tritone. This means that the augmented fourth, which comprises three whole-tones, is a true tritone, while the diminished fifth, because of its accidental-spelling, is ''not'' made up of three whole-tones and is therefore not a tritone. However, it is acceptable as an informal convention to refer to the diminished fifth as a &quot;tritone.&quot;]
*In Jazz, the minor 9th is often considered too dissonant for practical use. This is the basis for some notes being called &quot;avoid notes&quot;, typically the 4th of a major scale - it sounds dissonant because it forms a minor 9th with the 3rd. Other &quot;avoid notes&quot; are the minor 6th in aeolian mode, or the minor 2nd in phrygian mode. Some chords are typically voiced to avoid a minor 9th (musicians invert the interval and play a major 7th instead). For example, in a Cadd11 chord (see [[../Complete List of Chord Patterns/]]), there is a minor ninth between the third, E and the eleventh F. If the F is played ''below'' the E, the interval becomes a major seventh, which is less dissonant.

==The perfect fourth==
The perfect fourth is the inversion of the perfect fifth. In common practice music, it can be both consonant and dissonant: in this case, it has a need for resolution when unsupported by lower notes, in which case it is dissonant even though it sounds as &quot;good&quot; as the fifth. The fourth is always consonant when supported by a lower third or perfect fifth, for example, E-G-C-E is consonant, but G-C-E is dissonant. In more contemporary music, many consider the fourth to always be as consonant as the fifth.

In Medieval music, the perfect fourth was even considered a perfect consonance, as the perfect fifth and the octave. However, this attitude no longer prevails.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

Atonal music is a generalizing term used to define music that seems to lack a clear ''tonal center''. Nearly all music in the western classical tradition is considered 'tonal': that is, its harmonic structure is primarily triadic and hierarchically organized around a prominent tonal center. Atonal music works tend to deny or expand this notion by using alternative structural strategies (frequently - but not exlusivelly - mathematical, the most famous being [[w:serialism|serialism]]). As a result, many listeners used to traditional tonality may find atonal music very challenging at first, in particular because the lack of a tonal heirarchy means that highly dissonant chords are far more common (and, indeed, early practitioners of the style often deliberately used these chords as to avoid any implied reference to a tonic). That said, others argue that atonality is simply another musical language which, like all other languages (including traditional tonality), cannot be learned or appreciated until one has been immersed in it.

== A brief history of atonality ==

Composer [[w:Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Schoenberg]] is generally seen as the first composer to fully embrace 'atonality', although a number of other composers (such as [[w:Bartok|Bartok]] and [[w:Scriabin|Scriabin]]) had been moving in that direction for some time. In 1925, after experimenting with free atonality, he composed his ''Suite fur Klavier'', the first piece of music ever written using the [[w:twelve-tone music|twelve-tone method]] of composing. His students, [[w:Alban Berg|Alban Berg]] and [[w:Anton Webern|Anton Webern]], followed in his footsteps by composing numerous twelve-tone pieces; the method was generalised during the 1950s to include other parameters such as rhythm and volume, the resultant system being known as [[w:serialism|total serialism]].  

== Contemporary situation ==

All these influences over the last century have meant that it is now very difficult to draw a clear line between atonal and tonal music: for example, the music of Philip Glass has a clearly defined tonal center (and is generally seen as tonal), but it does not use harmony in the traditional way (as a means of giving the music direction), instead using repetition to create something more static; similarly, the music of composers such as [[w:Alfred Schnittke|Alfred Schnittke]] or [[w:John Adams|John Adams]] combines elements of tonal and atonal music freely and undogmatically; this approach can be seen as far back as Berg's [[w:Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] of 1936, which sounds almost tonal in many places despite its use of the twelve-tone method]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many ways to describe musical notes, including solfege, letters, numbers, tablature, and of course the standard music staffs. It is important to have a working knowledge of ''all'' of these (except tablature, as it is instrument-specific and many instruments do not use it at all).

==Letters==
Letter names give a label to each letter of the C major scale: C D E F G A B. Notes can be sharpened or flattened; between D and E comes a note called either D{{sharp}} (&quot;D sharp&quot;) or E{{flat}} (&quot;E flat&quot;). Even more confusingly, E can be called D{{dblsharp}} (&quot;D double-sharp&quot;), and D can be called E{{dblflat}} (&quot;E double-flat&quot;)! For now, you need only know that a D{{sharp}} and an E{{flat}} are enharmonically equivalent (that is, they have the same pitch, but serve a different [[w:en:diatonic functionality|diatonic function]]) in the simplified tuning most commonly used today. You will learn about diatonic function later.

These are the letter names used in English, Dutch, and possibly a few other languages. However, Germany, Scandinavia (such as Iceland, Denmark, Sweden) and Slavic countries have another system: their C major scale is C D E F G A H. Their H corresponds to our B. They also use the letter B, to mean the note we call B flat. They do not use special letters for any other notes, however, for instance, what we call a C sharp they would call &quot;Cis&quot;, &quot;Ciss&quot; or &quot;Cís&quot; (depending on the language), which literally means &quot;C sharp&quot;. We will not concern ourselves with these differences as this alternate system is almost never encountered in English language texts. Some other countries don't use letters for notes at all, but instead the fixed-doh solfege system, where &quot;Do&quot; or &quot;Ut&quot; always means the note C. This is an inflexible system unlike the moveable-doh one used in English, where &quot;Do&quot; (or &quot;Doh&quot;) can be any pitch.

==Solfege==
Solfege is one of the most common ways of expressing musical notes for vocalists. In fact, in some countries such as Spain, Portugal and France, solfege is always used instead of note names. 

The major scale in solfege runs: do re mi fa sol la ti. (Note: in some regions, such as Portugal,  &quot;ti&quot; is called &quot;si&quot;).  After &quot;ti&quot; comes &quot;do&quot; again, one octave higher than the previous &quot;do.&quot;  Notes outside the scale (sharps and flats) are expressed in different ways according to regions.  In some the equivalent to sharp or flat is added after the name of the note (C sharp would thus be Do dièse in France and Belgium). In other regions, another syllable with the same initial letter is used, although this is mostly reserved for instructional uses. For example, the pitch between &quot;re&quot; and &quot;mi&quot; can be called either &quot;ri&quot; or &quot;m&amp;eacute;&quot;.  The proper syllable to use is based on whether you are travelling up or down the scale.  The first letter of the syllable should come from the previous note, while the second letter is inherited from the next note in the sequence. Most commonly, the chromatic ascending scale is &quot;do di re ri mi fa fi sol la li ti/si do&quot; and the descending scale is &quot;do ti/si te la le sol se fa fe mi me re ra do.&quot;

In India, Solfege is called &quot;Sargam&quot; and the scale runs: sa re ga ma pa dha ni 

The &quot;movable do&quot; system is the one most commonly used, where do becomes the tonic of the key (C in the key of C, etc.) &quot;Fixed do&quot; is also used at some major colleges and universities, where do is always C, no matter what the key is. This involves a lot more use of chromatic solfege though. 

This book will not use solfege. More information can be obtained in [[w:en:Solfege|Wikipedia's treatment of the subject]]. The material should be learned and practiced, but it is useful mostly in communicating with other musicians who use the system.

==Numbers==
Numbers are used in lieu of solfege to describe relative tones. Either Roman numerals (I II III) or Arabic numerals (1 2 3) can be used. A major scale would be: I II III IV V VI VII. Each number can be pronounced either like a cardinal number (&quot;one, two, three...&quot;) or an ordinal number (&quot;first, second, third...&quot;). These can be sharpened and flattened, but the sharp is usually written before the numeral: {{sharp}}II (&quot;augmented second&quot;), {{flat}}III (&quot;minor third&quot;).

==Latin names==
Latin names follow the same principle as the solfege scale and numerals. The notes are called the tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant, dominant, submediant, and leading tone. Of these, it is most important to remember the &quot;tonic&quot; (I), &quot;subdominant&quot; (IV), and &quot;dominant&quot; (V), because these tones and chords built on these tones are used the most often.

==Tablature==
Tablature is notation specific to an instrument or class of instruments, usually plucked-string instruments such as the [[w:en:guitar|guitar]] or aerophones like the [[w:en:harmonica|harmonica]]. It is mostly used in popular music for guitar and bass, because many players of these instruments do not read standard notation and the notation does not help illustrate fingerings, for instance, a &quot;middle C&quot; can be played on several different strings on the guitar, but they all look the same in standard notation. However, tablature usually lacks information on rhythm. Instead, tablature notation assumes that the reader is familiar with the tune or can hear its demonstration on a recording or other source. For these reasons, much professional guitar music includes standard notation along with tablature, with the tab staff running below the standard staff. Tablature is also common on the Internet, often in ASCII form but also in files that can be read by programs such as [http://www.guitar-pro.com/ Guitar Pro] or the [http://www.power-tab.net/ Power Tab Editor]  (the latter is freeware).

Tablatures are not useful for the purposes of explaining music theory because they describe how to play an instrument, that is, the mechanics of producing musical sounds but not the underlying ideas, that is, the expression of certain pitches in a logical rhythmic structure.

==Standard notation==
:''This is a preliminary version. Standard music notation will probably have its own chapter, in which case only a cursory introduction will remain here.''

Standard notation is used to demonstrate how a piece is played. Unlike tablature, it applies to any instrument. It indicates key signatures, time signatures, rhythms, tempo, dynamics (how loud each instrument should be), and so on. A highly trained musician can sometimes take a piece of sheet music written in standard notation, look it over once or twice, and then play the song as though he or she had been playing it his or her whole life.

For instance, below is the C major scale, including a C at the end, in standard notation.

[[Image:C major scale.png]]
&lt;!-- 

## no longer relevant, after change of image [[Image:Cmajor.png]] - 
## perhaps someone can resurrect the original image with license

Here we see a staff (the five lines extending across the image horizontally), a treble clef (the leftmost symbol on the staff; also called the &quot;G&quot; clef because the curl centers around the G), a [[Music:Rhythm|time signature]] indicating 4/4 time (using the &quot;common time&quot; symbol), followed by four quarter notes, a bar line, four more quarter notes, and the thick double bar line indicating the end of the score. If this were intended to be played, there might be a tempo specification such as ''moderato'' above the staff. 

--&gt;

The standard notation staff has five lines and four spaces. From bottom to top the five lines are E G B D F, which is commonly memorized as an acrostic such as:

'''E'''very&lt;br/&gt;
'''G'''ood&lt;br/&gt;
'''B'''oy&lt;br/&gt;
'''D'''oes&lt;br/&gt;
'''F'''ine&lt;br/&gt;      
      
The four spaces between the five lines are F, A, C, and E, which should surely be easy for an English speaker to remember, because together they spell &quot;face&quot;.

But what about the first two notes, which are below the staff? Well, the second note is just below the E, so it must be D. The first is below that, so it must be C. It also has a line through it to indicate it is placed on an &quot;invisible&quot; line. This line is called a ledger line. A note could be placed below this ledger line, which would be B. Or a note could be placed below that, on another ledger line, and it would be A.  Notes can continue to be placed on ledger lines above and below the staff infinitely, but extending too far from the staff is impractical, because the pitches will become very hard to read.


==Lead Sheet notation==

Lead Sheet notation is an abbreviated variant of Standard notation used in jazz and popular music.  It consists of a single note melody line on a treble staff, and letter chord symbols.  For vocal pieces, lyrics are optional.  Standard notation specifies every note exactly as it is to be played.  Notation programs such as MuseScore, Sibelius, and Finale, can play standard notation.  Lead sheet notation allows -- in fact, requires -- the player to interpret and embellish.  A &quot;Fake Book&quot; is a collection of Lead Sheets.

I think we have a nice idea here: Python is a very good teaching medium.  In my humble opinion, it can be for object-oriented programming (OOP) what Pascal was for structured programming.

It is very simple and yet has implemented all OOP concepts i ever heard about.

So, i'd like to ask your opinion, dear wikipedians: how to complement this WikiBook so it becomes a full fledged WikiBook and a nice introduction to programming with Python ? -- [[User:Hgfernan|Hgfernan]] 12 May 2004

So far we've tacitly assumed we can just calculate force as a function of position, set up the ODE

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}=\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

and start solving.

It is not always so simple.

Often, we have to deal with motion under constraint; a bead sliding on a wire, a ball rolling without slipping, a weight dangling from a string.

There has to be some force keeping the bead on the wire, but we don't know what it is in advance, only what it does. This isn't enough information for us to write down the ODE.

We need a way of solving the problem without knowing the forces in advance.

How easy this is depends on the type of constraint.

*If the constraint is an inequality, as with the weight on the string, there is no straightforward analytical method.

*If the constraint can be written as a set of differential equations, and those equations can't be integrated in advance, there is an analytical method, but it is beyond the scope of this book. A ball rolling without slipping falls into this category.

*If the constraint can be written as a set of algebraic equations, and frictional forces are negligible, there is a straightforward method that solves the problem.

==Generalised coordinates==

Suppose we have a system of ''n'' particles satisfying ''k'' constraints of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f_k(\mathbf{r}_1, \cdots , \mathbf{r}_n, t)=0&lt;/math&gt;

then we can use the constraints to eliminate ''k'' of the 3''n'' coordinates of the particles, giving us a new set of 3''n''-''k'' independent ''generalised coordinates''; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;3''n''-'k''&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Unlike the components of the position vectors, these new coordinates will not all be lengths, and will not typically form vectors. They may often be angles.

We now need to work out what Newton's laws will look like in the generalised coordinates.

===Derivation===

The first step is to eliminate the forces of constraint.

We will need to consider a ''virtual displacement''. This is an infinitesimal displacement made, while ''holding the forces and constraints constant''. It is not the same as the infinitesimal displacement made during an infinitesimal time, since the forces and constraints may change during that time.

:We write the total force on particle ''i'' as
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_i=\mathbf{F}^a_i+\mathbf{F}^c_i&lt;/math&gt;
:the sum of the externally applied forces and the forces of constraint.

:Newton's second law states
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}^a_i+\mathbf{F}^c_i = \mathbf{F}_i=\dot{\mathbf{p}}_i&lt;/math&gt;

:We take the dot product of this with the virtual displacement of particle ''i'' and sum over all particles.
::&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i \left(\mathbf{F}^a_i+\mathbf{F}^c_i-\dot{\mathbf{p}}_i \right)\cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:We now assume that the forces of constraint are perpendicular to the virtual displacement. This assumption is generally true in the absence of friction; e.g,  the force of constraint that keeps a ball on a surface is normal to the surface.

:This assumption is called ''D'Alembert's principle''. Using it we can eliminate the forces of constraint from the problem, giving
::&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i \left(\mathbf{F}^a_i-\dot{\mathbf{p}}_i \right)\cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:or
::&lt;math&gt;
\sum_i \mathbf{F}^a_i \cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i = 
\sum_i \dot{\mathbf{p}}_i \cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

:The left hand side of this equation is called the ''virtual work''.

Now we must change to the generalised co-ordinate system.

:We write
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i=\mathbf{r}_i(q_1, q_2, \cdots ,q_{3n-k}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

:Using the chain rule gives
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i=\sum_j \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \dot{q}_j
+ \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:and
::&lt;math&gt;\delta\mathbf{r}_i=\sum_j \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \delta q_j
&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that this implies
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j}= \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}_i}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

:The virtual work is, dropping the superscript,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_i \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i &amp; = &amp; 
\sum_{i, j} \mathbf{F}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} 
\delta q_j\\ &amp; = &amp; \sum_j Q_j \delta q_j \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:where the ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the generalised force.

We now manipulate the right hand side of (1) into a form comparable with this last equation

:The right hand side term is
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_i \dot{\mathbf{p}}_i \cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i &amp; = &amp;
\sum_i m_i\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i \\
&amp; = &amp; \sum_{i, j} m_i\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \delta q_j \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

:The terms in the coefficient of ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be rearranged

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_i m_i\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} &amp;
= &amp; \sum_i \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_i\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \right) - 
m_i\dot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \frac{d}{dt}
\left( \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \right) \right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \sum_i \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_i\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}_i}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right) - 
m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot 
\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}_i}{\partial q_j}\right] \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:on substituting in equation (2) from above

On taking a close look at this last equation, we see a resemblance to the total  kinetic energy,
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2}\sum_i m_i v^2_i&lt;/math&gt;

:We now further rearrange to get an expression explicitly involving ''T''.

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_i m_i\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j}
&amp; = &amp;
\sum_i \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( m_i\mathbf{v}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}_i}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right) - 
m_i \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \frac{\partial\mathbf{v}_i}{\partial q_j}\right] 
\\ &amp; = &amp; 
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{q}_j} 
\frac{1}{2} \sum_i m_i v^2_i  \right) - 
\frac{\partial}{\partial q_j}\frac{1}{2}  \sum_i m_i v^2_i  \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{q}_j} T \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial q_j} T \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this last expression into (1) along with the generalised force give

:&lt;math&gt; 
\sum_j \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right) - \frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} -Q_j \right] \delta q_j = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the &amp;delta;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, unlike the &amp;delta;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, are independent, this last equation can only be true if all the coefficients vanish.

That is we must have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} 
- \frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} = Q_j \quad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

These are the equations of motion for the system, in a general set of coordinates for which all constraints are automatically satisfied.

For example, suppose we have a cylinder, mass ''m'', radius ''a'', rolling without slipping on a flat plane.

The kinetic energy of the cylinder is

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2}m \dot{x}^2 + \frac{1}{8}ma^2 \dot{\theta}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

using the results from [[General Mechanics/Rigid Bodies|Rigid Bodies]], where ''x'' is the axis in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and &amp;theta; is the angle of rotation.

Rolling without slipping implies
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=a\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

so we get

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{5}{8}m\dot{x}^2 \quad \frac{5}{4}m\ddot{x}=Q_x&lt;/math&gt;

The cylinder has the same kinetic energy as if its mass were 20% greater. If there is no torque on the cylinder then ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;=''F''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the cylinder behaves in every respect as though it were a 20% larger point mass.

To use (3) more generally, we need an expression for the ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;

Suppose, as is often the case, that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_i=-\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} V&lt;/math&gt;

then, by definition

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_j Q_j \delta q_j &amp; = &amp; \sum_i \mathbf{F}_i  \cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_i \\
&amp; = &amp; \sum_{i, j} \mathbf{F}_i  \cdot 
\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \delta q_j \\ 
&amp; = &amp;  -\sum_{i, j} \frac{\partial V}{\partial \mathbf{r}_i} 
\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_i}{\partial q_j} \delta q_j \\ 
&amp; = &amp; -\sum_j \frac{\partial V}{\partial q_j} \delta q_j
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so, equating coefficients, the generalised force is 

:&lt;math&gt;Q_j=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial j}&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this generalised force into (3) gives

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial (T-V)}{\partial \dot{q}_j} 
- \frac{\partial (T-V)}{\partial q_j} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

since ''V'' has been assumed independent of the velocities.

In fact, this last equation will still be true for some velocity dependent forces, most notably magnetism, for a suitable definition of ''V'',  but we won't prove this here.

We call the ''T-V'' the ''Lagrangian'', ''L'', and write  
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} 
- \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

We call these equations ''Lagrange's equations''. They are useful whenever Cartesian co-ordinates are inconvenient, including motion under constraint.

===Example===

Suppose we have two identical point masses, ''m'', connected by a string, length ''a''. The string is threaded through an hole in a flat table so that the upper mass is moving in a horizontal plane without friction, and the lower mass is always vertically below the hole. The distance of the upper mass from the hole is ''r''.

&lt;!-- diagram, later --&gt;

The position of the mass on the table is best described using polar coordinates, (''r'',&amp;theta;). Its kinetic energy is then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{r}^2+r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the lower mass is ''d(a-r)/dt''=''-dr/dt'', so the total kinetic energy is 

:&lt;math&gt;T= \frac{1}{2}m \left( 2\dot{r}^2+r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The potential energy is 

:&lt;math&gt;V = mg(a-r)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the gravitational acceleration.

This means

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{1}{2}m \left( 2\dot{r}^2+r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 \right) +mg(r-a)&lt;/math&gt;

and the equations of motion are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} 
- \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} &amp;  = &amp; 
m\frac{d}{dt}\left( r^2 \dot{\theta}\right) &amp; = &amp;  0 \\
\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} 
- \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} &amp;  = &amp; 
2m\ddot{r}-mr\dot{\theta}^2+mg &amp; = &amp;  0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these equations says that the angular momentum is constant, as expected since there is no torque on the particles. If we call this constant angular momentum ''l'' then we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}=\frac{l}{mr^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the second equation of motion becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{r}=\frac{l^2}{2m^2r^3}-\frac{g}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, if initially
:&lt;math&gt;l^2&gt;g m^2 r^3, \,&lt;/math&gt; 
then the lower ball will be pulled out of the hole, at which point these equations of motions cease to apply. They only hold when 0&amp;le;''r''&amp;le;''a'', a constraint which is not easily tamable.

Notice, we have not needed to calculate the tension in the string, which is the force of constraint in this problem.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a complete reference on chord formation.

This one of the chord trees that will aid in the writing and analysis of music. You can move down the tree but you may not retrograde(go backwards) until reaching the bottom. There are, of course exceptions including cadencing using the IV to I and the so-called deceptive cadences that typically go from V to vi. You may move across the levels and interchange the chords and can skip levels entirely if so desired. (Example- I, IV, ii, V, I, vi, V, I)

       I
   
   vi --- iii
   
   IV --- ii
 
    V --- vii diminished

The dominant seventh is sometimes just called the &quot;seventh&quot;, even though it contains a minor seventh and not a major seventh.

Any chord with a major third can have the third replaced by a major second or perfect fourth to form a suspended chord. Given a chord C, this would be written Csus2 (&quot;C suspended second&quot;) and Csus4 (&quot;C suspended fourth&quot;) for a major chord. As these only apply to the major second and major fourth, there is no such thing as, say, a Csus6, which would probably be properly written as Gsus4/C or C5add6 if it has a fifth, or else Am/C.
However, in certain circles it is said thought that replacing the fifth in a triad with a sixth is a type of suspention, eg Csus6 would contain C, E and A, rather like an Am. This is however more accurately notated as C6.

|}

Notice the diminished seventh chord has a double-flatted seventh, which is enharmonically the same as a sixth, so you may find the diminished chord alternately written as &quot;1 ♭3 ♭5 6&quot;. The double-flat notation is more correct because it shows how the seventh is further diminished from the half-diminished state.

Sometimes a diminished seventh chord is notated the same way as a diminished triad. Even more confusingly, sometimes both forms are called the &quot;diminished chord&quot;! You can make the distinction between the two to avoid ambiguity. However, keep in mind that they're ultimately very similar chords anyways, and you can usually interchange them.

==Other==

|-
| 1 3 ♯5 7 || augmented seventh || 7♯5, maj7+5 || Whole tone (6 note scale)
|}

It's worth mentioning that you might hear some people (usually rock guitarists) call fifth chords 'power chords'.

==9th, 11th, and 13th chords==
7th chords can be extended to 9th, 11 and 13th chords. If you have a C7 (C dominant seventh), then the corresponding chords would be C9, C11 and C13 . The C9 is a C7 with a major ninth (or second) added. The C11 is a C7 with a eleventh (or  perfect fourth) added as well as the major ninth. The C13 is a C7 with a major thirteenth (or sixth) added as well as the major eleventh and major ninth added.

The same principles that can be applied to seventh chords apply to minor and major 7th chords. For instance, you can have a minor 13th: 1 ♭3 (5) ♭7 9 11 13. The notes added are always the same: ninth, eleventh, and/or thirteenth, not augmented or diminished. Only the seventh chord base changes.

It is very uncommon to extend a major 7th chord with an 11th. This is because there would be an interval of a minor ninth between the third and the eleventh. If an eleventh is played, it is usually altered (this is dealt with below).

==Additions==
When a note is added to these chords in a manner that does not fit the tables above, it is often written &quot;addX&quot;, where X is the number of the added note, e.g., add6 for an added sixth. For instance, C major with an added sixth would usually be written Cadd6. If the number is above 7, then it will be an octave higher than the root note.

Do not confuse Csus2 and Cadd2, or Csus4 and Cadd4. Suspended chords ''must not'' have a major third, but major chords with additions ''must''. (Note that in jazz, suspended chords sometimes have a major third added, but only when the player wants dissonance).

Do not confuse Cadd9 with C9; the latter has a minor seventh, but the former does not.

An &quot;added second&quot; and &quot;added ninth&quot; are often considered synonymous, because a ninth is a second. Some musicians argue they imply different voicings of the chords, for instance, add9 should have the second raised an octave, but add2 should not. The &quot;added ninth&quot; is more common, especially since it is rare that one wants to add a major second that is literally one whole tone away from the first (and possibly a third as well).

The 9th here is what is often referred to as a ''compound interval'', that being an interval greater than an octave, such as a 9th being an octave up from a 2nd, a minor 10th being an octave up from a minor 3rd... Greater intervals eg a minor 17th theoretically exist (this being a minor 3rd raised 2 octaves) but such things above a modification of a 13th are never spoken of. To create a compound interval one would add 7 (once for every octave) raised to the number in the name to raise the interval. The same applies subtracting seven to lower the pitch by octaves.

==Alterations==
Sometimes something such as &quot;♭5&quot; or &quot;♯5&quot; (also written &quot;-5&quot; and &quot;+5&quot;, respectively) will be appended to the end of the chord; this means play the chord as normal but flatten or sharpen the fifth respectively. (This is why C&lt;sup&gt;&amp;oslash;&lt;/sup&gt; is sometimes written Cm7♭5, because a minor 7th with a flatted fifth has the same notes as a half-diminished chord. Similarly, it may also be pronounced &quot;C minor seventh flat five&quot;.) 

Any of the extension notes (9th, 11th and 13th) can also be altered, something fairly common in [[../Jazz|jazz]]. The possible alterations are ♭9, ♯9, ♯11 and b13. You may be wondering why there is no b11 or ♯13. Stop and think for a second about which notes they would be in the key of C major. The b11 would be E, which is the major third in C, and the ♯13 would be Bb, the minor 7th, so a chord symbol like C b11 ♯13 would imply C7. Which would you rather read? 

The table below shows common altered chords:
{| border=1
! Notes !! Full Name !! Abbreviation
|-
| 1 3 (5) 7 9 ♯11 || major ♯11 (lydian) || maj7♯11, &amp;Delta;♯11, &amp;Delta;♯4
|-
| 1 3 (5) ♭7 ♯9 || dominant ♯9 || 7♯9
|-
| 1 4 (5) ♭7 ♭9 || suspended ♭9 (phrygian) || ♭9sus
|-
| 1 3 (5) ♭7 ♭9 ♯9 ♯11 b13 || dominant altered (super-locrian) || 7alt, alt
|}

The names in brackets after the full name refer to the mode from which the chord is derived (there should be a section on this eventually).

==Bass notes==
The ''bass note'' of a chord is the lowest note of the chord. The most common case is that the bass note is the root note, for instance, in a C major chord C-E-G ascending in pitch from left to right, the bass note is C, which is the root note. But if the chord were instead G-C-E, it is still a C major chord (specifically, an ''inverted'' C major), but G is the bass note, while C is still the root note. Sometimes the bass note is omitted for brevity when it is still a part of the chord, which may be needed, for instance, when many rapid chord changes would otherwise make the names illegible on a printed score.

Occasionally, bass notes are not a part of the original chord. For instance, a D minor does not have a C note, but sometimes Dm/C is seen, meaning the D minor chord is played normally but with a C note below it. These are often called ''slash chords''.

This notation can also indicate a polychord.

==Polychords==
''Polychords'' are superimposed chords. They are more common in some kinds of music ([[../Jazz|jazz]]) than others ([[../Classical|classical]]).

This may occur, for instance, when a piano player plays a D minor with the left hand (possibly omitting its fifth) and a G major with the right hand. The most common notation for this polychord is probably G/D. This leaves out something important: that the D is a minor chord! (Usually, only the first chord, the higher one in pitch, has anything more than a single note specified.) This also clashes with the more common meaning of &quot;G chord but with a D bass note&quot;, which is really a specific case of a polychord where the lower &quot;chord&quot; has only one note. Therefore, this notation is incomplete, but it is the closest thing to a standard notation for polychords. There are many nonstandard systems in use, however. Sheet music using polychords should explain the system used, if possible.

A common use of polychords is arpeggiating one chord against a different chord. For instance, on a piano, the left hand may be holding down a G5 chord while the right hand arpeggiates D minor chords. This would be notated Dm/G.

Polychords might be used as exotic voicings for many chords. The following examples use a pipe (|) to separate the upper chord from the lower one. (the examples are given here for a C chord)

|}

==Quartal Chords==
Some arrangements use chords based on fourths, often two fourths in the upper notes with an independent bass, which gives the following possibilities:

{| border=1
! Notes !! Suggested notation !! Voicing for
|-
| ♭7 b10 b13 / 1 || B♭7sus4/C || Cm7♭6(aeolian)
|-
| 4 ♭7 b10 / 1 (5) || F7sus4/C || Cm11
|-
| 1 4 ♭7 / 1 (5) || C7sus4/C || C7sus4
|-
| 5 8 11 / 1 (5) || G7sus4/C || Csus4
|-
| 2 5 8 / 1 (5) || D7sus4/C || Csus2
|-
| 6 9 12 / 1 (5) || A7sus4/C || C6sus2
|-
| 3 6 9 / 1 (5) || E7sus4/C || C69
|-
| 7 10 13 / 1 (5) || ♭7sus4/C || Cmaj13
|-
| ♯4 7 10 / 1 (5) || F♯7sus4/C || Cmaj13♯11
|}

Of course, the fourths part of the chord can be present in two other inversons - sus4 or sus2, making B♭7sus4/C, Ebsus4/C and Absus2/C equivalent for instance.

==Chord implication==
Sometimes chords are not specifically indicated by notes, but ''are'' indicated by the chord structure, or even notes that don't form chords by themselves but ''sound'' like they belong to a certain chord. The most usual way to handle this is to put the chord name in parentheses. Implied chords are also often used when there are constant chord changes throughout a section (several per measure), and marking each one would make little sense, so the &quot;underlying&quot; chord is chosen (usually a chord the others are temporarily centered around). Sometimes sheet music will use only implied chords, in which case often chord names will appear normally, and perhaps a footnote will state something such as &quot;chords reflect implied harmony&quot;.I hope this helped you!

Could someone change this page an possibly others to make:
 - kinetic energy represented by K, and not KE
 - potential energy represented by U, and not PE

Potential energy can have a subscript to indicate the type, for example gravitational potential energy &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt;

Update: Ok, I just changed it myself. Looks much better now, IMO.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''''musical scale''''' is a set of notes, usually not arbitrary, of which most notes in a piece of music might be chosen.  There exist many scales with highly distinctive sounds, though some are much more common than others. the term &quot;scale&quot; comes from the latin word 'scala' meaning 'ladder'. Thus a scale is a ladder of notes.

==Intervals==

===Simple intervals===

Before we progress, we must discuss '''''intervals'''''. An interval is usually defined as the distance between two pitches, that is, how many semitones lie between them. When the two pitches are the same, they are said to be in ''unison'', and two notes played in unison can be impossible to distinguish from a single note when they are played by the same instrument and the instrument is properly tuned. When they are twelve semitones apart, they are an ''octave'' apart (we will learn why it is called an octave shortly).  '''''Simple intervals''''' are defined as those intervals that are one octave or less apart.

Intervals are usually named according to the relationship of the higher note to the lower note in the major scale, though they also have alternative names depending upon the spelling of the particular notes on the page of music.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  Semitones  !!  Common Name  !!  Alternative Names
|-
| 0 || '''perfect unison''' || diminished second
|-
| 1 || '''minor second''' || augmented unison
|-
| 2 || '''major second''' || '''diminished third'''
|-
| 3 || '''minor third''' || '''augmented second'''
|-
| 4 || '''major third''' || diminished fourth
|-
| 5 || '''perfect fourth''' || augmented third
|-
| 6 || '''tritone''' || '''augmented fourth, diminished fifth'''
|-
| 7 || '''perfect fifth''' || diminished sixth
|-
| 8 || '''minor sixth''' || augmented fifth
|-
| 9 || '''major sixth''' || '''diminished seventh'''
|-
| 10 || '''minor seventh''' || '''augmented sixth'''
|-
| 11 || '''major seventh''' || diminished octave
|-
| 12 || '''perfect octave''' || augmented seventh
|}

This table gives the most common nomenclature for each interval according to its relation to the major scale.  For example, the interval of ''four'' semitones occurs as the '''''third''''' note of the major scale, and thus it is called a '''major third'''.  The interval of ''seven'' semitones occurs as the '''''fifth''''' note of the major scale, and so it is called a '''perfect fifth'''.  Whether an interval is &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;major&quot; depends on mathematical ratios of frequencies as determined by the Greeks.  Other possible names are given under &quot;alternate names,&quot; and the most common of these are emboldened.  One may draw several inferences from this table:

#If any '''perfect''' interval is raised by one semitone, the interval becomes '''augmented'''
#If any '''perfect''' interval is lowered by one semitone, the interval becomes '''diminished'''
#If any '''major''' interval is raised by one semitone, the interval becomes '''augmented'''
#If any '''major''' interval is lowered by one semitone, the interval becomes '''minor'''
#If any '''major''' interval is lowered by ''two'' semitones, the interval becomes '''diminished'''

===Compound intervals===

'''''Compound intervals''''' are defined as those intervals greater than one octave apart.  These intervals may be considered by exactly the same rules as their simple counterparts.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  Semitones  !!  Name(s)  !!  Simple Counterpart
|-
| 13 || '''minor ninth''' || minor second
|-
| 14 || '''major ninth''' || major second
|-
| 15 || '''minor tenth''' || minor third
|-
| 16 || '''major tenth''' || major third
|-
| 17 || '''perfect eleventh''' || perfect fourth
|-
| 18 || '''augmented eleventh''' || tritone
|-
| 19 || perfect twelfth || perfect fifth
|-
| 20 || '''minor thirteenth''' || minor sixth
|-
| 21 || '''major thirteenth''' || major sixth
|-
| 22 || minor fourteenth || minor seventh
|-
| 23 || major fourteenth || major seventh
|-
| 24 || '''double octave''' || octave
|}

The compound intervals work by following the same five rules as the simple intervals above (so the augmented eleventh might also be called a diminished twelfth!).  Why even bother giving them separate names?  The answer lies in their normal function within music.  Complex jazz chords are built around stacks of thirds, and so the terms &quot;ninth,&quot; &quot;eleventh,&quot; and &quot;thirteenth&quot; are needed to designate intervals larger than a seventh.


===Mnemonic memorization examples===
The following chart intends to give some mnemonic support in recognising musical interval. For each interval, ascending or descending, a popular song is given that contains it prominently. Capitalized syllables or a &quot;&gt;&quot; mark the stated interval: [http://www.trainear.com/ Trainear] is an online ear trainer that's specifically for associating intervals to songs. Here are some examples for each interval:

==Traditional Scales==

===The major scale===

The major scale is a ''diatonic'' scale. Originally a Church mode named by Heinrich Glarean in 1547  as the ''Ionian'' scale/mode.  There is some confusion with beginners as to why the Church modes are named after Greek tribes. A common belief is that the Ionian scale was invented by the Greeks. The Ancient Greeks did not have an Ionian scale but they did lay the foundation for its existence. The Ancient Greeks did have a system of music and we know quite a lot about their music theories from the Ancient Greeks themselves. The real origin of the Ionian mode is the period known as the Renaissance which started in Italy with the 13th century writer Petrach. Renaissance is the French word for &quot;rebirth&quot;. The &quot;rebirth&quot; in this case was the rediscovery of lost Ancient Greek texts that had been brought back from the East (including Jerusalem) by Crusaders and other parties. A lot of these books had been unavailable in Western Europe for centuries. These books sparked a desire to rediscover the roots of European civilization. The Renaissance scholars took the music practices of their time which already had been in use for hundreds of years and codified them in reference to the Greeks. You can read about the Ancient Greek system of tetrachords and scales if you're interested. It must be pointed out that we have no idea about the sounds of the instruments of the Ancient Greeks and only a few fragments of music exists. It is now believed that the Church modes are derived from early Christian mass chants which themselves were adapted from Jewish chants. It may be that modern Western Music has for its origins Eastern Jewish liturgical chants and Ancient Greek theories codified from the view of a Renaissance mindset a thousand years later. 

The major scale (Ionian mode) is most simply described as the eight note progression consisting of the perfect and major semitiones, i.e., perfect unison, major 2nd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5th, major 6th, major 7th, and perfect octave in that order.  You have already seen the major scale: C D E F G A B; do re mi fa sol la ti; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. Scales may be constructed according to their ''intervals''. You can see that the C major scale consists of two whole tones, then a semitone (moving from E to F), then three more whole tones, then again a semitone (moving from B back to C). If we add the implied C at the end of the scale, we would have eight notes: C D E F G A B C.

===The minor scale===

The minor scale,  the [[w:Aeolian mode|Aeolian mode]], is also a diatonic scale. The C minor scale is C D E{{flat}} F G A{{flat}} B{{flat}}; 1 2 {{flat}}3 4 5 {{flat}}6 {{flat}}7. You can see that it consists of one whole tone, then a semitone (moving from D to E{{flat}}), then two more whole tones, then again a semitone (moving from G to A{{flat}}), and a final whole tone. If we add the implied C at the end of the scale, we would have eight notes: C D E{{flat}} F G A{{flat}} B{{flat}} C. 

The intervals of the natural minor scale follow the following pattern: tone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone.  The following chart demonstrates this natural minor scale construction.

The minor scale is the sixth ''mode'' of the major scale; that is, the minor scale starts on the 6th note of the ''relative major'' scale. In the case of the C minor scale, the relative major scale is E{{flat}} major. We can illustrate this with two octaves of the Eb major scale, highlighting the C minor scale. E{{flat}} F G A{{flat}} B{{flat}} '''C D E{{flat}} F G A{{flat}} B{{flat}} C''' D E{{flat}}. You will learn more about [[../Modes|modes]] later.

==Pentatonic and Blues Scales==

===The pentatonic scales===

A pentatonic scale has five notes. Each note in the major pentatonic scale is a fifth (seven semitones) relative to another note. For example, the C major pentatonic scale starts with C, then from there we can get G, then D, then A, then E. Rearranging the scale to ascending order from C, we get: C D E G A. This is the C major scale with F and B removed! So, why use it? Sometimes less is more, and pentatonic scales are certainly easier to use when improvising.

The major pentatonic is the same as the major scale with the 4 and 7 notes removed, while the minor pentatonic has the 2 and {{flat}}6 notes removed, that is, the minor pentatonic is relative to the major pentatonic.

So, to use our earlier example contrasting the E{{flat}} major pentatonic with the C minor pentatonic: E{{flat}} F G B{{flat}} '''C E{{flat}} F G B{{flat}} C''' E{{flat}}.

Pentatonic scales are abundant in rock and blues music, though these are certainly not their only uses.  Traditional Chinese and Japanese music has defined and named many more pentatonic scales, some of which do not use the western twelve-note basis.

===The blues scale===

The most common blues scale has six notes, and may be considered a minor Pentatonic scale with the diminished fifth added as a ''[[w:en:blue note|blue note]]''.  In a major blues tune, the minor third is also considered a blue note.

Therefore, the C blues scale is: C E{{flat}} F G{{flat}} G B{{flat}}.  Sometimes the raised seventh degree (B) is added to this scale but most often used as a passing note, much like the diminished fifth.  The blues scale is most commonly used in jazz improvisation to create a &quot;bluesy&quot; flavor.

==The Symmetric Scales==

Symmetric scales include scales such as the whole-tone scale, octatonic scale (also called the diminished scale), and chromatic scale, and their defining characteristic is that they are composed of repeating subunits within an octave.  This property allows these scales to be transposed to another pitch (or &quot;key&quot;), yet retain exactly the same notes as the original scale.

===The chromatic scale===

The simplest of the symmetric scales, the chromatic scale, is composed of repeating semitones (half-steps).  Thus, the chromatic scale built on C contains the notes C,D{{flat}},D,E{{flat}},E,F,G{{flat}},G,A{{flat}},A,B{{flat}}, and B.  The chromatic scale built on D{{flat}} contains the notes D{{flat}},D,E{{flat}},E,F,G{{flat}},G,A{{flat}},A,B{{flat}},B, and C.  Notice that these are exactly the same notes as the chromatic scale built on C.  In fact, a chromatic scale built on any note of the twelve-tone western music scale will share these notes, a property which warrants the inclusion of this scale among the symmetrics. Usually chromatic scales are spelled with sharps when ascending and flats when descending. 

As noted above, composers will often choose certain notes from this scale to use more frequently than others, thereby providing the listener with a sense of a &quot;home&quot; note, referred to as the tonic.  However, many composers in the twentieth century have demonstrated that using all twelve chromatic notes equally can defeat any sense of tonal center.  This technique is called atonality or, less commonly, pantonality, and can have a very unsettling effect upon those unaccustomed to this music.  An everyday occurrence of atonal music would be in the soundtracks to many horror films, documentaries, or other movies where there is a need for extreme dissonance and tension to match the onscreen action.

===The whole-tone scale===

The whole-tone scale is made of repeating whole tones (whole-steps).  Therefore, a whole-tone scale built upon D{{flat}} would contain D{{flat}},E{{flat}},F,G,A, and B.  Like the chromatic scale, these pitches are the same pitches that one would find in a whole-tone scale built upon E{{flat}}, or any of the pitches in this particular scale.  For instance, a whole-tone scale built upon F would be F,G,A,B,D{{flat}},E{{flat}}, and a whole-tone scale built on B would be B,C{{sharp}},D{{sharp}},F,G,A. These two are really the same scale, since C{{sharp}}=D{{flat}} and D{{sharp}}=E{{flat}}.  For this reason, there exist only two possible whole-tone scales:
 
#the scale including the pitches C,D,E,F{{sharp}},G{{sharp}}, and A{{sharp}} 
#the scale including the pitches D{{flat}},E{{flat}},F,G,A, and B.

Any whole-tone scale within the western musical system will fall enharmonically into one of these two categories.

The whole-tone scale was used widely by impressionists to create a floating, ethereal sound.  The scale also finds a place in jazz improvisation, as it is among the most colorful scales to use where a raised-fifth scale degree is indicated.  Incidentally, the scale contains all of the notes of two augmented chords placed side-by-side, a whole step apart.

===The octatonic (diminished) scale===

The octatonic, or diminished, scale is among the simplest scales possible, yet has been used to tremendous effect in nearly every genre.  This eight-note scale may be conceived in two manners, but both of the approaches use a repeating subunit of alternating whole-steps and half-steps.  The first manner, most often used by classical composers and termed diminished, encourages beginning with a whole-step, while the second, used frequently by jazz players and composers who call it octatonic, encourages starting with the half-step.  Beginning from C (using the second method), the octatonic scale would include the notes C,D{{flat}},E{{flat}},E,F{{sharp}},G,A, and B{{flat}}.  As with the other symmetric scales, this scale may be moved to a different starting note yet retain the same pitches as the original.  Thus, E{{flat}},E,F{{sharp}},G,A,B{{flat}},C,D{{flat}} is an octatonic scale (second method) that shares all eight pitches with the octatonic scale starting on C.  There are, then, three different octatonic scales possible: 

#C,D{{flat}},E{{flat}},E,F{{sharp}},G,A, and B{{flat}}
#C{{sharp}},D,E,F,G,A{{flat}},B{{flat}}, and B
#D,E{{flat}},F,G{{flat}},A{{flat}},A,B, and C

Any other octatonic scales within the western system will fall enharmonically into one of these three groups.

The use of the octatonic scale in western music can be seen as early as Bach, who used pieces of the scale within his counterpoint to imply diminished harmony.  Modern composers of the classical canon use this scale as a colorful alternative to redundant diatonicism or austere chromaticism.  Jazz improvisers often turn to the diminished scale to improvise over a dominant seventh harmony to imply the flat-ninth degree of a chord.  The octatonic/diminished scale is extremely versatile: a single octatonic scale (C,D{{flat}},E{{flat}},E,F{{sharp}},G,A, and B{{flat}} contains the notes of four dominant-seventh chords (C,E,G,B{{flat}}; E{{flat}},G,B{{flat}},D{{flat}}; F{{sharp}},A{{sharp}},C{{sharp}},E; and A,C{{sharp}},E,G), two fully-diminished-seventh chords (C,E{{flat}},G{{flat}},B{{flat}}{{flat}} and C{{sharp}},E,G,B{{flat}}), and a plethora of major, minor, and diminished chords.

===Other &quot;theoretical&quot; symmetric scales===

Other collections of pitches may be considered &quot;symmetric scales,&quot; even though they are not often used as such.  The fully-diminished-seventh chord is made up of repeating subunits of minor thirds (three semitones), and there are three distinct pitch collections: 

#C,E{{flat}},G{{flat}},B{{flat}}{{flat}} (=A)
#C{{sharp}},E,G,B{{flat}}
#D,F,A{{flat}},C{{flat}}

Any other fully-diminished seventh chords are enharmonically equivalent to one of these three collections.

The augmented chord is made of repeating subunits of major thirds (four semitones), and there are four distinct collections:

#C,E,G{{sharp}}
#D{{flat}},F,A
#D,F{{sharp}},A{{sharp}}
#E{{flat}},G,B

Any other augmented chords are enharmonically equivalent to one of these four collections.

Finally, the interval of a tritone (diminished fifth, augmented fourth, or six semitones) may be considered with the symmetric scales because there are only six distinct varieties using the subunit of a tritone.  A tritone beginning on C (C,F{{sharp}}) has the same pitches as a tritone beginning on F{{sharp}} (F{{sharp}},C)

Hi Magefile

I have a similar project and I looking for help to finish it off - see http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst . My name is Mark Horner and we'd like to put all our content on the web in the end but we are looking for help to finish it off. The licence is also the GFDL so all of the content can be imported into Wikibooks - in fact that would make it easier for us to put it on the web.

Please let me know if you could be convinced to help out - all my details are on the website.

--------------------------

Mark: thank you for your invitation.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to help out with your project; I don't have the time to commit to anything more than a few minutes on the weekend (which is what Wikibooks is for me).  I do not have any formal qualifications, and have not yet finished university, so I do not know how much I could contribute anyway - again, Wikibooks is great because it's a weekend hobby for everyone.  Finally, what drew me to wikibooks is the anonymity - I hate giving out my identity, having my email available on the web, etc.

However, as you pointed out, your project is FDL, so you can take what you need from Wikibooks.  I encourage you to take anything of mine as well, as long as it stays under that license.  (You don't need the permission, as it's already FDL.  But if you wish to get consent from the author(s) first anyway, consider my consent given)

I am very pleased to see a serious effort being made to provide a Free textbook that will be used in a high school (wikibooks is wonderful, but no schools are planning to use it any time soon).  I do wonder, though - is English the dominant language in South Africa, or are you writing it in English in order to allow international work on, and use of, the project?  Or perhaps both?

Thanks again.

---------

---------------------------

I will probably be contributing mostly to the math/science areas (specifically, trig, algebra, geometry and physics).

If you wish to respond to something I've written elsewhere, post it on this page.

Modes are alternative tonalities (scales) that can be derived from the familiar major scale by starting on a different scale tone.  Music that uses the traditional major scale can be said to be in the Ionian mode.  For example, in the key of C, the Ionian scale would be C D E F G A B.

The other familiar mode is Aeolian.  It can be derived by starting the Ionian (major) scale on the sixth scale tone.  For example, A Aeolian would be A B C D E F G.  This is the A natural minor scale.

The other modes can be derived similarly, by starting the major scale on the other tones.  If we stick with only the white notes on the piano, we can derive seven different modes.  These are:

{|Modes derived from the major scale, also known as the church modes.
| Ionian || C || D || E || F || G || A || B || C
|-
| Dorian || D || E || F || G || A || B || C || D
|-
| Phrygian || E || F || G || A || B || C || D || E
|-
| Lydian || F || G || A || B || C || D || E || F
|-
| Mixolydian || G || A || B || C || D || E || F || G
|-
| Aeolian || A || B || C || D || E || F || G || A
|-
| Locrian || B || C || D || E || F || G || A || B
|}

As you can see, each mode denotes a unique set of intervals above the root tone.  The result of this is that music written in each mode has a very distinct sound.  Progressions that sound familiar in one mode may sound otherworldly in another mode.

The tonic chord alone sounds different in many modes.  In Ionian, Lydian and Mixolydian, the tonic triad is major.  In Dorian, Phrygian and Aeolian, the tonic is minor.  In Locrian, the tonic is diminished.  Because the diminished triad sounds so unstable, Locrian is the most rarely employed mode.

However, since the modes all contain the same set of notes, any or all of them can be used within a single piece without accidentals.  A certain mode can be achieved simply by creating a section which resolves to or is based on the tonic of that mode.  Again using the white keys of the piano to illustrate, a section resolving to A would be in the A Aeolian mode, while one resolving to C would be in the C Ionian mode.

The modes can also be written by noting their differences from the Ionian, i.e. what sharpened or flattened notes they contain.  This approach yields the following (in order of increasing number of flats):

{|Modes in terms of sharps and flats|

| Lydian || I || II || III || #IV || V || VI || VII
|-
| Ionian || I || II || III || IV || V || VI || VII
|-
| Mixolydian || I || II || III || IV || V || VI || bVII
|-
| Dorian || I || II || bIII || IV || V || VI || bVII
|-
| Aeolian || I || II || bIII || IV || V || bVI || bVII
|-
| Phrygian || I || bII || bIII || IV || V || bVI || bVII
|-
| Locrian || I || bII || bIII || IV || bV || bVI || bVII
|}

Thus the E Phrygian is an E Ionian (major) scale with flattened second, third, sixth, and seventh degrees.  It can be observed that, for a constant tonic, each mode contains the same notes as the previous except for one note being lowered, and that the lowered notes appear in the following order: IV (natural, lowered from IV#), VIIb, IIIb, VIb, IIb, Vb.  This is known as the &quot;order of flats&quot;, and can be used as an aid for memorizing the modes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Identifying keys==
Finding the proper key is a matter of finding the I note, then finding what mode the notes seem to follow. This can be easy or difficult, depending on the piece of music. Some music does not really follow a mode at all, but non-modal key signatures are frowned upon.

The first place to start would be the [[../Chord Structures|chord structure]]. The most important chord is the I chord. This is the chord formed by the first, third, and fifth notes in a mode. This is why a C major chord is called C major, because the C major scale starts with '''C''' D '''E''' F '''G'''. Every mode naturally contains three major chords, three minor chords, and one diminished triad. By &quot;naturally&quot;, it is meant that all of the notes in the chord are in the mode's scale. D major is not natural in the key of C because a D major consists of D, F#, and A, and F# does not occur in the C major scale. One major chord can be extended to a dominant seventh chord (in the key of C major, this would be G7), and ''all'' of the minor chords can be extended to a minor seventh chord.

Suppose we have a song and have determined it to have these chords: C, F, and G. This is a classic example of a three-chord song, of which the twelve-bar blues is a good example (but there are many other possible three-chord structures). Suppose the C chord occurs often and it is also the first and last chord in the song &amp;mdash; it is probably the I chord, because the tendency is to begin on the I chord, move around a bit, and come back (&quot;resolve&quot;) to the I chord. C, F, and G happen to be the three major chords that occur naturally in the C major scale. Therefore the chord progression is in C major and it is quite likely that any melody accompanying it is also in C major.

But what if a chord progression contains six major chords? Not all of those can occur naturally in a given mode, since each mode has only three. Does the mode change during the progression? Well, yes and no. Certainly, the key signature won't change with each chord change; it will only change when the piece as a whole is changed to another key, generally when a new chord becomes the I chord.

By the way, in case you forgot, harmonic minor and melodic minor scales use the same key signatures as the natural minor scale.

==Another way==
There is another way to figure out the key signature, which does not depend on matching the scale exactly. You still have to find the 1 note and write the notes of the scale. Let's say your song uses only five notes: 1 2 4 5 b7. (This is a Japanese scale.) It has a flatted seventh; everything else is the same as in the major scale. What modes have a flattened seventh? Everything except lydian and ionian. The one with the fewest sharps/flats of these is mixolydian. Therefore, this scale fits well into the mixolydian mode, and a piece written in this scale would have the appropriate key signature for the mixolydian mode.

Now let's try a different Japanese scale: 1 2 b3 5 b6. This one is even easier: what modes have a flatted third ''and'' a flatted sixth? Aeolian and locrian. But locrian does not have a 5 note, it has a b5 note instead. Therefore this piece uses the key signature for the natural minor scale.

Now a really puzzling one: 1 b3 4 b5 5 b7. What mode has a flatted third, fifth, ''and'' seventh? Locrian. But again this scale has the 5 note, which locrian does not! This scale doesn't fit into ''anything''. There are two possibilities: the song is indeed in locrian and the 5 is outside the scale. Notes outside of a scale in a song are rare and usually stand out (sometimes to good effect and sometimes to bad effect, depending somewhat on your musical tastes); if a note is used often it is part of the scale. If you find the 5 note is not part of the scale, then the song is in locrian. However, it turns out this &quot;modified locrian&quot; with the 5 note is very common and it is called the ''blues scale''. (If confronted with this apparent scale, this is the ''much'' more likely possibility. Another way to look at this is as the minor pentatonic with a b5. The minor pentatonic is 1 b3 4 5 b7.) The normal way to handle this particular oddball scale is to just interpret it as a major scale. That is, the &quot;F blues&quot; is F major.

More often than not, the bass instrument (typically a cello or electric bass) will play the tonic as the first note of the first measure (excluding pick-ups).

==Atonal music==
Some music is &quot;[[../Atonal|atonal]]&quot;, meaning there ''is'' no tonal center and therefore no I note. Atonal music has a fairly distinct flavor, and generally does not occur in popular music &amp;mdash; even rap music is tonal when it has any musical notes at all. The most well-known atonalists were probably [[w:Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Sch&amp;ouml;nberg]] (who, incidentally, abhorred the word &quot;atonal&quot;) and, after Sch&amp;ouml;nberg's death, [[w:Igor Stravinsky|Igor Stravinsky]] (before Sch&amp;ouml;nberg's death, Stravinsky made many tonal pieces). Atonal music is perhaps the musical equivalent of abstract art, that is, free from the confines of the usual way of things &amp;mdash; at the possible cost of an inability to be understood by others because the work does not inspire the same thoughts in them.

What key signature do you use for atonal music? None at all. The very idea of a key implies the presence of a tonal center, which atonal music, by definition, lacks. But be sure that the piece really is atonal before arriving at this conclusion. The [[w:Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone technique]], which Schoenberg usually used (and Stravinsky used it as well), is almost a dead giveaway that a piece is atonal (but there are ''some'' tonal songs that use it).

Chemical reactions can be divided into several classes each having similar characteristics. These different types of reactions will be discussed in greater detail throughout the book.  You will find that almost every reaction you see can fall into one of these categories, so make sure that you understand them.

==Synthesis Reactions==

{{Helpful hint|hint=Synthesis reactions always yield one product.  Reversing a synthesis reaction will give you a ''decomposition reaction''.}}
The general form of a synthesis reaction is A + B → AB.  Synthesis reactions &quot;put things together&quot;.  

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_{2(g)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)} \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the most well-known example of a synthesis reaction—the formation of water via the fusion of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;2\hbox{Na}_{(s)} + \hbox{Cl}_{2(g)} \to 2\hbox{NaCl}_{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Another example of a synthesis reaction is the formation of sodium chloride (table salt).
|}

Because of the very high reactivities of sodium metal and chlorine gas, this reaction releases a tremendous amount of heat and light energy.  Recall that atoms release energy as they become stable, and consider the octet rule when determining why this reaction is so favorable.

==Decomposition Reactions==
These are the opposite of synthesis reactions, with the format AB → A + B.  Decomposition reactions &quot;take things apart&quot;. Just as synthesis reactions can only form one product, decomposition reactions can only start with one reactant.  Compounds that are unstable will decompose quickly without outside assistance.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} \xrightarrow{electricity} 2\hbox{H}_{2(g)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
|One example is the electrolysis of water (passing water through electrical current) to form hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{2(l)} \to 2\hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Hydrogen peroxide slowly decomposes into water and oxygen because it is somewhat unstable.  The process is sped up by the energy from light, so hydrogen peroxide is stored in dark containers to slow down the decomposition.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{CO}_{3(aq)} \to \hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{C}\hbox{O}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Carbonic acid is the carbonation that is dissolved in soda.  It decomposes into carbon dioxide and water, which is why an opened drink will not lose its fizz.
|}

{{Info|Decomposition, aside from happening spontaneously in unstable compounds, occurs under three conditions:  thermal, electrolytic, and catalytic.  ''Thermal decomposition'' occurs when a substance is heated.  ''Electrolytic decomposition'', as shown above, is the result of an electric current.  ''Catalytic decomposition'' happens because a catalyst breaks apart a substance.}}

==Single Replacement Reactions==
Single replacement reactions, also called single displacement, swap one component with another, in the format AB + C → AC + B.

Adding hydrochloric acid to zinc will cause a gas to bubble out:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Zn}_{(s)} + 2\hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{ZnCl}_{2(aq)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Double Replacement Reactions==
In these reactions, also known as &quot;double displacement reactions&quot;, two compounds swap components, in the format AB + CD → AD + CB

==Double Displacement==
this is also called an &quot;exchange&quot;. Here are the examples below:

1.)  HCl + NaOH ----&gt; NaCl + H2O

===Precipitation===
{{Wikipedia|Precipitation (chemistry)}}
A precipitation reaction occurs when an '''ionic''' substance comes out of solution and forms an insoluble (or slightly soluble) solid. The solid which comes out of solution is called a '''precipitate'''. This can occur when two soluble salts (ionic compounds) are mixed and form an insoluble one—the precipitate. 

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{2Pb}(\hbox{NO}_3)_{2(aq)} + heat_{(aq)} \to \hbox{2PbO}_{(s)} + 4\hbox{NO}_{2(aq)}+{2O}_2&lt;/math&gt;
|An example is lead nitrate mixed with potassium iodide, which forms a bright yellow precipitate of lead iodide.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Pb}_{(aq)}^{2+} + 2\hbox{NO}_{3(aq)}^- + 2\hbox{K}_{(aq)}^+ + 2\hbox{I}_{(aq)}^- \to \hbox{PbI}_{2(s)} + 2\hbox{K}_{(aq)}^+ + 2\hbox{NO}_{3(aq)}^-&lt;/math&gt;
|Note that the lead iodide is formed as a solid. The previous equation is written in molecular form, which is not the best way of describing the reaction. Each of the elements really exist in solution as individual ions, not bonded to each other (as in potassium iodide crystals). If we write the above as an '''ionic equation''', we get a much better idea of what is actually happening.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Pb}_{(aq)}^{2+} + 2\hbox{I}_{(aq)}^- \to \hbox{PbI}_{2(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
|Notice the like terms on both sides of the equation.  These are called ''spectator ions'' because they do not participate in the reaction.  They can be ignored, and the '''net ionic equation''' is written.
|}

In the solution, there exists both lead and iodide ions. Because lead iodide is insoluble, they spontaneously crystallise and form the precipitate.

===Acid-Base Neutralization ===
In simple terms, an acid is a substance which can lose a H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion (i.e. a proton) and a base is a substance which can accept a proton. When equal amounts of an acid and base react, they '''neutralize''' each other, forming species which aren't as acidic or basic.

{|  border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{HCl}_{(aq)} + \hbox{NaOH}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)} + \hbox{NaCl}_{(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
| For example, when hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide react, they form water and sodium chloride (table salt).
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}^+_{(aq)} + \hbox{OH}^-_{(aq)} \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;
| Again, we get a clearer picture of what's happening if we write a net ionic equation.
|}

Acid base reactions often happen in aqueous solution, but they can also occur in the gaseous state. Acids and bases will be discussed in much greater detail in the [[../Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|acids and bases]] section.

==Combustion==
[[Image:Combustion_methane_intl.png|thumb|The combustion of methane (releasing heat and light)]]
Combustion, better known as burning, is the combination of a substance with oxygen.  The products are carbon dioxide, water, and possible other waste products.  Combustion reactions release large amounts of heat.  C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, better known as propane, undergoes combustion.  The balanced equation is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_3\hbox{H}_8 + 5\hbox{O}_2 \to 3\hbox{CO}_2 + 4\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Combustion is similar to a decomposition reaction, except that oxygen and heat are required for it to occur.  If there is not enough oxygen, the reaction may not occur.  Sometimes, with limited oxygen, the reaction will occur, but it produces carbon monoxide (CO) or even soot.  In that case, it is called ''incomplete combustion''.  If the substances being burned contain atoms other than hydrogen and oxygen, then waste products will also form.  Coal is burned for heating and energy purposes, and it contains sulfur.  As a result, sulfur dioxide is released, which is a pollutant.  Coal with lower sulfur content is more desirable, but more expensive, because it will release less of the sulfur-based pollutants.

==Organic Reactions==
[[Image:Carboxyl3D.png|left|thumb|170px|This is ''carboxylic acid''.  All functional groups end with an &quot;R&quot;—a placeholder for the rest of the molecule.]]
Organic reactions occur between organic molecules (molecules containing carbon and hydrogen). Since there is a virtually unlimited number of organic molecules, the scope of organic reactions is very large. However, many of the characteristics of organic molecules are determined by '''functional groups'''—small groups of atoms that react in predictable ways.

Another key concept in organic reactions is Lewis basicity. Parts of organic molecules can be electrophillic (electron-loving) or nucleophillic (nucleus, or positive loving). Nucleophillic regions have an ''excess'' of electrons—they act as Lewis bases—whereas electrophillic areas are electron deficient and act as Lewis acids. The nucleophillic and electrophillic regions attract and react with each other (needless to say, this has inspired many terrible organic chemistry jokes).

Organic reactions are beyond the scope of this book, and are covered in more detail in [[Organic Chemistry]].  However, most organic substances can undergo replacement reactions and combustion reactions, as you have already learned.

==Redox==
[[Image:Redox reaction.png|thumb|The formation of hydrogen fluoride causes fluoride to oxidize and hydrogen to reduce.]]
Redox is an abbreviation of '''reduction/oxidation''' reactions. This is exactly what happens in a redox reaction, one species is '''reduced''' and another is '''oxidized'''. Reduction involves a gain of electrons and oxidation involves a loss, so a redox reaction is one in which electrons are ''transferred'' between species. Reactions where something is &quot;burnt&quot; (burning means being oxidised) are examples of redox reactions, however, oxidation reactions also occur in solution, which is very useful and forms the basis of electrochemistry.

Redox reactions are often written as two '''half-reactions''' showing the reduction and oxidation processes separately. These half-reactions are balanced (by multiplying each by a coefficient) and added together to form the full equation. When magnesium is burnt in oxygen, it loses electrons (it is oxidised). Conversely, the oxygen gains electrons from the magnesium (it is reduced).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\hbox{Mg} &amp;\to&amp; \hbox{Mg}^{2+} + 2e^- &amp; \times 2 \\
\hbox{O}_2 + 4e^- &amp;\to&amp; 2\hbox{O}^{2-} &amp; \times 1 \\
2\hbox{Mg} + \hbox{O}_2 + 4e^- &amp;\to&amp; 2\hbox{MgO} + 4e^- &amp; \ \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Redox reactions will be discussed in greater detail in the [[General Chemistry/Redox Reactions/Oxidation and Reduction equations|redox]] section.

'''New England cuisine''' is a type of American cuisine found in the north east United States. It is characterized by extensive use of [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] and [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy]] products and often involves either baking or slow cooking vegetables with a thickened broth.

Traditional New England dinners sometimes include side dishes of cottage cheese, boiled/or blanched green beans as well as soup or salad.

To some Americans, it means clam chowder, made with [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] as [[Cookbook:New England Clam Chowder|New England Clam Chowder]], or with [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] as [[Cookbook:Manhattan Clam Chowder|Manhattan Clam Chowder]]. [[Cookbook:Corn Chowder|Corn Chowder]] is a thick soup filled with whole corn ([[Cookbook:Maize|maize]]) kernels. Chowder is often commonly associated with the [[Cookbook:New England cuisine|New England]] region of the United States.

The recipe below for &quot;New England chowder&quot; is, oddly, not a clam chowder.

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

==New England Chowder==

Have a good haddock, cod, or any other solid fish; cut it in pieces three inches square, put a pound of fat salt pork in strips into the pot, set it on hot coals and fry out the oil; take out the pork and put in a layer of fish, over that a layer of onions in slices, then a layer of fish with slips of fat salt pork, then another layer of onions, and so on alternately until your fish is consumed; mix some flour with as much water as will fill the pot; season with black pepper and salt to your taste, and boil it for half an hour. Have ready some crackers (Philadelphia pilot bread if you can get it) soaked in water till they are a little softened; throw them into your chowder five minutes before you take it up. Serve in a tureen.

This is similar to the traditional Scottish soup [[Cookbook:Cullen skink|cullen skink]].

==Daniel Webster's Chowder==

Four tablespoonfuls of onions, fried with pork; a quart of boiled potatoes well mashed; 1 1/2 pounds of sea biscuit broken; 1 teaspoonful of thyme mixed with one of summer savory: 1/2 bottle of mushroom catsup; one bottle of port or claret; 1/4 of a nutmeg, grated; a few cloves, mace, and allspice; 6 pounds fish (sea-bass or cod), cut into slices; 25 oysters, a little black pepper, and a few slices of lemon. The whole put in a pot and covered with an inch of water, boiled for an hour and gently stirred.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GeneralChemTOC|prev=Ionic bonding|next=Metallic bonds}}

Covalent bonds create '''molecules''', which can be represented by a '''molecular formula'''. For chemicals such as a basic sugar (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), the ratios of atoms have a common multiple, and thus the '''empirical formula''' is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Note that a molecule with a certain empirical formula is not necessarily the same as one with the same molecular formula.

==Formation of Covalent Bonds==
Covalent bonds form between two atoms which have incomplete octets — that is, their outermost shells have fewer than eight electrons.  They can share their electrons in a ''covalent bond''.  The simplest example is water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  Oxygen has six valence electrons (and needs eight) and the hydrogens have one electron each (and need two).  The oxygen shares two of its electrons with the hydrogens, and the hydrogens share their electrons with the oxygen.  The result is a covalent bond between the oxygen and each hydrogen.  The oxygen has a complete octet and the hydrogens have the two electrons they each need.

When atoms move closer, their orbitals change shape, letting off energy. However, there is a limit to how close the atoms get to each other—too close, and the nuclei repel each other.

[[Image:Argon dimer potential.png|center|400 px]]

One way to think of this is a ball rolling down into a valley.  It will settle at the lowest point.  As a result of this potential energy &quot;valley&quot;, there is a specific '''bond length''' for each type of bond. Also, there is a specific amount of energy, measured in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) that is required to break the bonds in one mole of the substance.  Stronger bonds have a shorter bond length and a greater bond energy.

==The Valence Bond Model==
One useful model of covalent bonding is called the ''Valence Bond'' model. It states that covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons with each other in order to complete their valence (outer) electron shells. They are mainly formed between non-metals. 

An example of a covalently bonded substance is hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A hydrogen atom on its own has one electron—it needs two to complete its valence shell. When two hydrogen atoms bond, each one shares its electron with the other so that the electrons move about both atoms instead of just one. Both atoms now have access to two electrons: they become a stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule joined by a '''single covalent bond'''.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Covalent_bond_h.png|Diagram of a covalent bond between hydrogen atoms]]&lt;/center&gt;

===Double and Triple Bonds===
Covalent bonds can also form between other non-metals, for example chlorine. A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its valence shell—it needs 8 to complete it. Two chlorine atoms can share 1 electron each to form a single covalent bond. They become a Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.

Oxygen can also form covalent bonds, however, it needs a further 2 electrons to complete its valence shell (it has 6). Two oxygen atoms must share 2 electrons each to complete each other's shells, making a total of 4 shared electrons. Because twice as many electrons are shared, this is called a 'double covalent bond'.  Double bonds are much stronger than single bonds, so the bond length is shorter and the bond energy is higher.

Furthermore, nitrogen has 5 valence electrons (it needs a further 3). Two nitrogen atoms can share 3 electrons each to make a N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule joined by a 'triple covalent bond'.  Triple bonds are stronger than double bonds.  They have the shortest bond lengths and highest bond energies.

==Electron Sharing and Orbitals==
Carbon, contrary to the trend, does not share four electrons to make a quadruple bond. The reason for this is that the fourth pair of electrons in carbon cannot physically move close enough to be shared. The valence bond model explains this by considering the '''orbitals''' involved.

Recall that electrons orbit the nucleus within a cloud of electron density (orbitals). The valence bond model works on the principle that orbitals on different atoms must '''overlap''' to form a bond. There are several different ways that the orbitals can overlap, forming several distinct kinds of covalent bonds.

===The Sigma Bond===
The first and simplest kind of overlap is when two s orbitals come together. It is called a '''sigma''' bond (sigma, or &amp;sigma;, is the Greek equivalent of 's'). Sigma bonds can also form between two p orbitals that lie pointing towards each other.  Whenever you see a single covalent bond, it exists as a sigma bond.  When two atoms are joined by a sigma bond, they are held close to each other, but they are free to rotate like beads on a string.

[[Image:Ligatio-covalens.jpg|center|thumb|The electron density is in between the two atoms in an &amp;sigma; bond.]]

===The Pi Bond===
The second, and equally important kind of overlap is between two parallel p orbitals. Instead of overlapping head-to-head (as in the sigma bond), they join side-to-side, forming two areas of electron density above and below the molecule. This type of overlap is referred to as a '''pi''' (&amp;pi;, from the Greek equivalent of p) bond.  Whenever you see a double or triple covalent bond, it exists as one sigma bond and one or two pi bonds.  Due to the side-by-side overlap of a pi bond, there is no way the atoms can twist around each other as in a sigma bond.  Pi bonds give the molecule a rigid shape.

Pi bonds are weaker than sigma bonds since there is less overlap. Thus, two single bonds are stronger than a double bond, and more energy is needed to break two single bonds than a single double bond.
 
[[Image:Pi-Bond.svg|center|thumb|The electron density lies above and below the atoms in a &amp;pi; bond.]]

===Hybridization===
{{Wikipedia|Orbital hybridisation}}
Consider a molecule of methane: a carbon atom attached to four hydrogen atoms.  Each atom is satisfying the octet rule, and each bond is a single covalent bond.

Now look at the electron configuration of carbon: 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  In its valence shell, it has two s electrons and two p electrons.  It would not be possible for the four electrons to make equal bonds with the four hydrogen atoms (each of which has one s electron).  We know, by measuring bond length and bond energy, that the four bonds in methane are equal, yet carbon has electrons in two different orbitals, which should overlap with the hydrogen 1s orbital in different ways.

To solve the problem, '''hybridization''' occurs. Instead of a s orbital and three p orbital, the orbitals mix, to form four orbitals, each with 25% s character and 75% p character. These hybrid orbitals are called '''sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''' orbitals, and they are identical. Observe:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C\quad   \frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;\;   \frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{2s}\;   \frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_x}\;   \frac{\uparrow\,}{2p_y}\;   \frac{\,\,}{2p_z}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C^{*}\quad \frac{\uparrow\downarrow}{1s}\;\;   \frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3} \frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3} \frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3} \frac{\uparrow\,}{sp^3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now these orbitals can overlap with hydrogen 1s orbitals to form four equal bonds.  Hybridization may involve d orbitals in the atoms that have them, allowing up to a '''sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' hybridization.

{{TextBox|1=

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Basic Idea==

In the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y = \sin x&lt;/math&gt;

if we are given &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; we can work out &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y &lt;/math&gt;.  

If we are given &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y &lt;/math&gt;, can we work out &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt;?

Look at the graph of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin x&lt;/math&gt; and you will see that for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y &lt; -1&lt;/math&gt; there aren't any answers at all, whilst for other values of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y &lt;/math&gt; there are infinitely many answers.  


If

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y = \sin x&lt;/math&gt;

we write the inverse of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin&lt;/math&gt; as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x = \sin^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the strange notation.  It's just a convention, and does not really fit in well with the convention of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin^2 x&lt;/math&gt; meaning &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\sin x)^2&lt;/math&gt;.  However, we are stuck with this notation.  It is so widely used and so familiar in mathematical work that in practice it does not cause confusion. On many calculators the alternative notation &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \arcsin&lt;/math&gt; is used.  

A calculator will only give one answer (or error) for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt;.  You can get some of the other answers by adding or subtracting multiples of 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  In a later section we spell out the conventions as to which answer is given by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt;.

==arcsin==
A common notation used for the inverse functions is the &quot;arcfunction&quot; notation, prefixing the function name by &quot;arc&quot; or sometimes just &quot;a&quot;.

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Sin}^{-1}x=\arcsin x=\mbox{asin} \,x&lt;/math&gt;, 
: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Cos}^{-1}x=\arccos x=\mbox{acos} \,x&lt;/math&gt;, and 
: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Tan}^{-1}x=\arctan x=\mbox{atan} \,x&lt;/math&gt;.  

The arcfunctions might perhaps be so named because of the relationship between radian measure of angles and arclength--the arcfunctions yield arc lengths on a unit circle.


==The Inverse Functions, Domain and Range==

The inverse of sine or cosine for some values has multiple answers and some values does not exist at all.  We'd like it if the inverse were a function, but according to the mathematical definition of a function it is not:

* A '''function''' is something that given one value always gives back a unique value as its 'answer'.  

&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin x&lt;/math&gt; is a function because given any x it gives back some value.  There is not really a function that is an inverse for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin x&lt;/math&gt; because, for example, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin 20^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin 160^\circ&lt;/math&gt; have the same value.  The inverse 'function' does not know whether to go back to 20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; or 160&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.  

To deal with this we need some more mathematical language.  We have mathematical terminology for what a function operates on and where its values end up.  A function like &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; needs to be accompanied by some agreement as to what values it can operate on and where they end up.  By convention &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sqrt{25}=5&lt;/math&gt;, though &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x=-5&lt;/math&gt; is also a valid solution to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x^2=25&lt;/math&gt;.  So how do we describe this kind of thing?

* The '''domain''' of a function is the set of values which it is defined on.  

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Reciprocal function}}
The function &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined on all values of x except for 0.  Its domain is the real numbers excluding zero.
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Factorial function}}

The factorial function, operates on the positive whole numbers.  As a function f - &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(1) = 1, f(2)=2, f(3)=6, f(4)=24 \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.  The factorial function is usually written by writing an exclamation point after a number.  So, 3 factorial is usually written as 3! and it is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6&lt;/math&gt;.  4 factorial is written as 4! and it is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24&lt;/math&gt;.

The domain of the factorial function is the positive whole numbers.
{{Robox/Close}}



* The '''range''' of a function is the set of values which it can take.  The range will depend on the domain too.  

{{ExampleRobox|title=Range of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
Consider the function
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;

If we use ordinary numbers for x like 37.2 or -1001.56 we always find &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a positive number (or zero).  The range of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the numbers greater than or equal to zero.
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Range of 2x}}
Consider the function
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)=2x&lt;/math&gt;

If we choose the domain of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be the numbers greater than or equal to 1, then the range of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the numbers greater than or equal to two.
{{Robox/Close}}

==More Notation==


* The '''integers''' are whole numbers like 1,2,3,4 and also include 0, -1, -2,-3...  A symbol we use to indicate the integers is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  The statement &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; means exactly the same thing as x is an integer.


* The '''reals''' include all the integers, and also fractions, and also other numbers like pi, and square root of 2.  The reals 'fill in the gaps' between the integers.  You'll get a better definition of the reals in a later book.  A symbol we use to indicate the reals is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  The statement &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; means exactly the same thing as x is a real number.


* A range of numbers in the reals can often be written using '''interval notation'''.  Here is an example for numbers greater than or equal to zero and less than one: [0,1).  The square and round brackets have special meaning.  The square bracket means the number is included.  A round bracket means the number is excluded.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Interval Notation}}
* The notation (1.3,100.7] means all numbers between 1.3 and 100.7, including 100.7 but excluding 1.3.
* The notation [-59.1,12.5] means all numbers between -59.1 and 12.5, including -59.1 and including 12.5.
* The notation (0,71.2) means all numbers between 0 and 71.2, excluding 0 and excluding 71.2.
{{Robox/Close}}


* Function '''composition''' is applying one function after another.  If we have two functions f and g, we write the composite function, applied to x as: &lt;math&gt;f \circ g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  This means first apply g to x, then apply f to that result.  We can regard &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; as a new function in its own right.


* An '''inverse''' to a function &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f&lt;/math&gt; is written &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f&lt;/math&gt; is the function that adds 12 to a number, then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the function that subtracts 12 from a number.


==Inverses to Trig functions==

Some textbooks 'solve' the problem of inverses for trig functions by defining new functions &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Sin}\, x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Cos}\, x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \mbox{Tan}\, x&lt;/math&gt; (all with initial capitals) to equal the original functions but with restricted domain.

With suitably restricted domain the functions &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Sin}\, x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Cos}\, x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Tan}\, x&lt;/math&gt; (all with initial capitals) do have inverses which are functions too.

The restrictions to allow the inverses to be functions are standard.  Here (and for the rest of this page) we are using radians to measure angles rather than degrees:  

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Sin}\, x&lt;/math&gt; has domain &lt;math&gt;\left[-\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{2} \end{matrix},\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{2} \end{matrix}\right]&lt;/math&gt;; 

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Cos}\, x&lt;/math&gt; has domain &lt;math&gt;\left[0,\pi\right]&lt;/math&gt;; and 

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Tan}\, x&lt;/math&gt; has domain &lt;math&gt;\left(-\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{2} \end{matrix},\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{2} \end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 

For each function, the restricted domain includes first-quadrant angles as well as an adjacent quadrant.

==Inverses, Really?==

It is important to note that because of these restricted domains, the inverse trigonometric functions do not necessarily behave as one might expect an inverse function to behave.  While 

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Sin}^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{6} \end{matrix}\right)\right)=\mbox{Sin}^{-1}\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}\right)=\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{6} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; (following the expected &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \mbox{Sin}^{-1}\left(\sin x\right)=x&lt;/math&gt;),

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Sin}^{-1}\left(\sin\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{5\pi}{6} \end{matrix}\right)\right)=\mbox{Sin}^{-1}\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix}\right)=\begin{matrix} \frac{\pi}{6} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 

For the inverse trigonometric functions, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f^{-1}\circ f(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; only when &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; is in the range of the inverse function.  

The other direction, however: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f\circ f^{-1}(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; to which we can apply the inverse function.

==The Inverse Relations==

'For completeness', here are definitions of the inverse trigonometric ''relations'' based on the inverse trigonometric ''functions''.  This section is really mostly about using mathematical notation to express how adding multiples of 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to an angle gives us another solution for the inverse.  Because we are working in radians we're adding multiples of two pi.  Some more notation being used here:

* Curly braces like so {} mean the 'set of', i.e. the set of whatever is inside them.
* The symbol &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cup&lt;/math&gt; is read as '''union'''.  The union of two sets is everything that is in either of them.  


* &lt;math&gt;\sin^{-1} x = \left\{ \mbox{Sin}^{-1} x + 2\pi n, n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} \cup \left\{ \pi - \mbox{Sin}^{-1} x + 2\pi n, n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}&lt;/math&gt; (the sine function has period &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, but within any given period may have two solutions and &lt;math&gt;\sin x=\sin\left(\pi-x\right)&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1} x = \left\{ \pm \mbox{Cos}^{-1} x + 2\pi n, n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}&lt;/math&gt; (the cosine function has period &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, but within any given period may have two solutions and cosine is even--&lt;math&gt;\cos x=\cos\left(-x\right)&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;\tan^{-1} x = \left\{ \mbox{Tan}^{-1} x + \pi n, n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}&lt;/math&gt; (the tangent function has period &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and is one-to-one within any given period)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is music theory? ==
Music theory is the study of music; and while the term is often applied to the Western musical tradition (more on that later), there are also music theories in other traditions around the world.

It is of interest to the reader to know that music theory emerged ''after'' the actual production of music. There were people making music long before we had ideas of what a major third is, and there were groups singing tribal songs long before we got the idea of a &quot;downbeat&quot;. Although these ideas were often practiced before they were understood, to have a knowledge of what they are and how they work reduces their difficulty and increases their potential and flexibility.

==What is music?==
Music can be many things, and while the subject of [[w:Definition of music|what constitutes music]] has been long debated and argued, we will not be spending considerable time on its definition.
Like all art, music is highly subjective and traditional.  It is hard to make sense of music from an alien culture or tradition.  This book only deals with a subset of music; a very large subset though. We look at the Western Tradition of music as it has evolved from the ancient European civilizations with influences from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. We will also look primarily at written music, rather than music which is only ever performed, but we realize that music notation can almost never capture everything that makes a piece. Sheet music is a limitation that we live with.
You will notice the words &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;usually&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;, and other similar terms used frequently as music is highly subjective and many &quot;rules&quot; are broken.

Music usually has five basic aspects: rhythm, melody, harmony, dynamics, and timbre.

; [[Music_Theory/Rhythm|Rhythm]] : Concerns note length, speed and stress — the &quot;time&quot; aspect.
; [[w:Melody|Melody]] : Concerns a series of notes — the &quot;horizontal&quot; aspect.
; [[w:Harmony|Harmony]] : Concerns notes played at once — the &quot;vertical&quot; aspect.
; Dynamics:  Concerns the volume of notes  — the &quot;volume&quot; aspect.
; Timbre : Concerns the physical sound of notes — the &quot;texture&quot; aspect.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Alkynes readily combine with water in the presence of acid (usually sulfuric acid) and mercury(II) salts (usually the sulfate is used) to form carbonyl compounds, in a process known as Kucherov's reaction. 
In the case of acetylene (ethyne) the product is acetaldehyde (ethanal), while other alkynes form ketones. Terminal alkynes reliably form methyl ketones and symmetric internal alkynes give single ketone products, but mixtures of ketones may form from unsymmetrical internal alkynes. 

[[Image:hydration_of_alkynes.png|center]]

The intermediate product is an enol (an alkene with a hydroxyl group attached to a doubly bonded carbon), which then transforms to its keto tautomer through keto-enol tautomerization.

== Mechanism ==

Alkene hydration only requires acid catalysis and proceeds through the most stable carbocation available (Markovnikov selectivity), but alkynes are less basic (less easily protonated), as they would generate less stable vinyl cations upon protonation. Both H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are catalysts in the hydration of alkynes. The Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; additive presumably adds to the alkyne to form a more stable vinyl cation (&amp;beta;-stabilized) than would be afforded by protonation. As with Markovnikov selectivity in the case of alkenes, the most stable vinyl cation (usually the most highly substituted) is preferred. 

&lt;small&gt;Addition to either end of a symmetric alkyne (internal or acetylene/ethyne) gives the same cation and only one carbonyl product is formed, but addition to unsymmetrical alkynes gives two possible cations, and two products are possible. Terminal alkynes selectively produce a methyl ketone owing to a strong preference for the most highly substituted vinyl cation, but unsymmetrical internal alkynes can produce two different vinyl cations, whose stabilities may be similar if the alkyne's substituents are electronically and sterically similar, and therefore two different ketone products would be obtained in a mixture. &lt;/small&gt;

After the addition of water and O-deprotonation to an &amp;alpha;-mercurated enol, the acid can effect an electrophilic substitution of the Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by &amp;alpha;-C-protonation (&lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-protonation) and elimination of Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (demercuration), a process akin to electrophilic aromatic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;Ar).[[#Note|[example]]]. Both routes result in an enol that (usually) tautomerizes to the (usually) more stable keto form, again an acid-catalyzed process.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;small&gt;The &amp;alpha;-mercurated enol may instead tautomerize to the (usually more stable) keto form in an acid-catalyzed step involving &amp;alpha;-C-protonation and O-deprotonation, but this is mechanistically unproductive; this must be reversed by reprotonation of the carbonyl O to trigger the fragmentation and loss of Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Both routes start with &amp;alpha;-C-protonation; whether this is followed by immediate demercuration or by O-deprotonation, O-reprotonation and demercuration (the &quot;tautomer detour&quot;) is indistinguishable. The more direct C-protonation-demercuration route is the most step-economical and suffices to explain the alkyne hydration process. Although both enol and keto forms of the &amp;alpha;-mercurated ketone likely co-exist, only the protonated version has mechanistic significance. &lt;/small&gt; 

=== Note ===
* A specific S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;Ar analogy to the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange involved in alkyne hydration is the acid-promoted demercuration of arylmercury(II) salts, triggered by &lt;i&gt;ipso&lt;/i&gt;-protonation, while the mercuration of arenes, a substitution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, would be an example of the reverse reaction.

= Introduction =

Perl's set of operators borrows extensively from the [[C programming language]]. Perl expands on this by infusing new operators for string functions (&lt;code&gt;.=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ne&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). C by contrast delegates its subset of Perl functionality to a library ''strings.h'', and ''ctype.h'', and includes no such functionality by default compilation. Perl also includes a highly flexible [[Perl Programming/Regular Expressions|Regex]] engine inspired by Sed with improvements to standard POSIX regexes, most notably the support of Unicode.

= The operators =

== Arithmetic ==

Most arithmetic operators are ''binary'' operators; this means they take two arguments. ''Unary'' operators only take one argument. Arithmetic operators are very simple and often transparent.

=== Binary ===
All the basic arithmetic operators, addition (&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;), subtraction (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;), multiplication (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;), and division (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;), and the modulus operator &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; exist. Modulus returns the remainder of a division (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;) operation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
# 3 goes into 4, 1 time  with 1 left over.
print 4%3;   # prints 1

# 2 goes into 4, 2 times with 0 left over.
print 4%2;   # prints 0

# 3 goes into -4, -2 times with 2 left over.
print -4%3;   # prints 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The exponentiation operator is &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;. It allows you to raise one value to the power of another. If you raise to a fraction you will get the root of the number. In this example the second result when raised to the power of 2 should return 2 (&lt;code&gt;(2**(1/2))**2 = 2&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
# Four squared:
print 4**2; # prints 16

# Square root of 2
print 2**(1/2); # prints 1.4142135623731
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; is provided for finding a square root. Other fractional powers (i.e., (1/5), (2/13), (7/5), and similar) are suitably found using the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator.

=== Unary ===

The auto-decrement (&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;), and auto-increment (&lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt;) operators are unary operators. They alter the scalar variable they operate on by one logical unit. On numbers, they add or subtract one. On letters and strings, only the auto-increment shift one up in the alphabet, with the added ability to roll-over. Operators that come in post- and pre- varieties can be used two ways. The first way returns the value of the variable ''before'' it was altered, and the second way returns the value of the variable ''after'' it was altered.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $foo = 1;

# post decrement (printed and then decremented to 0)
print $foo--; # prints 1
print $foo;   # prints 0
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $foo = 1;

# pre-decrement (decremented to 0 then printed)
print --$foo;  # prints 0
print $foo;    # prints 0
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $foo = 'd';

# pre-increment (incremented to e then printed)
print ++$foo;  # prints e
print $foo;    # prints e
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $foo = 'Z';

# post-increment (printed the incremented to AA)
print $foo++;  # prints Z
print $foo;    # prints AA
&lt;/source&gt;

== Assignment ==

The basic assignment operator is &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; that sets the value on the left side to be equal to the value on the right side. It also returns the value. Thus you can do things like &lt;code&gt;$a = 5 + ($b = 6)&lt;/code&gt;, which will set &lt;code&gt;$b&lt;/code&gt; to a value of 6 and &lt;code&gt;$a&lt;/code&gt; to a value of 11 (5 + 6). Why you would want to do this is another question.

The assignment update operators from C, &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt;, etc. work in perl. Perl expands on this basic idea to encompass most of the binary operators in perl.

| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;

|}

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $foo = 'Hello';
$foo .= ', world'; 
print $foo; # prints 'Hello, world';              

my $bar = '+';
$bar x= 6;
print $bar; # prints '++++++';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Comparison ==

Perl uses different operators to compare numbers and strings. This is done, because in most cases, Perl will happily ''stringify'' numbers and ''numify'' strings. In most cases this helps, and is consistent with Perl's ''DWIM Do-What-I-Mean'' theme. Unfortunately, one place this often does not help, is comparison.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

! numeric
! string
|-
| equal
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| not equal
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;ne&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| less than 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;lt&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| greater than 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| less or equal 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| greater or equal 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;ge&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| compare 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;code&gt;cmp&lt;/code&gt;
|}

== Logical ==

Perl has two sets of logical operators, just like the comparison operators, however not for the same reason. 

The first set (sometimes referred to as the C-style logical operators, because they are borrowed from C) is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;. They mean logical AND, OR, and NOT respectively. The second set is &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;.

The only difference between these two sets is the precedence they take (See [[#Precedence|Precedence]]). The symbolic operators take a much higher precedence than the textual. 

=== Conditionals===

Most of the time, you will be using logical operators in conditionals. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 # Only prints &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;, if both $a is 5 and $b is 2
 if ($a == 5 &amp;&amp; $b == 2) {        
     print &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, you could safely substitute &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; and the conditional would still work as expected. However, this is not always the case.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 #True, if $a is 5, and either $b, $c, or both are 2
 if ($a == 5 and $b == 2 || $c == 2) {
     print &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;;
 }
 #Using brackets, the order is made more clear.
 #This conditional acts in the same way as the last. 
 if ($a == 5 and ($b == 2 || $c == 3)) {
     print &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This, however, is completely different. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 if ($a == 5 &amp;&amp; $b == 2 or $c == 3) {
     print &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;;
 }
 #Equivalent and easier to understand with brackets
 if (($a == 5 &amp;&amp; $b == 2) or $c == 3) {
     print &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Most people prefer to use C-style logical operators and use brackets to enforce clarity rather than using a combination of textual and C-style operators (when possible), which can be very confusing at times.

=== Partial evaluation ===

Partial evaluation (or &quot;short circuiting&quot;) is the property of logical operators that the second expression is only evaluated, if it needs to be.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 ($a, $b) = (5, 2);
 #$b &lt; 3 is not evaluated at all, because when the interpreter
 #finds that $a == 4 is false, there is no need to evaluate $b &lt; 3
 #because the conditional is automatically false
 if ($a == 4 &amp;&amp; $b &lt; 3) {
     print &quot;I like cookies\n&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This also works with logical OR statements. If the first expression evaluates as true, the second is never evaluated, because the conditional is automatically true.

This becomes useful in a case like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 sub foo {
 #returns a true or false value
 }
 foo() or print &quot;foo() failed\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, if the &lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt; subroutine returns false, &quot;foo() failed\n&quot; is printed. However, if it returns true, &quot;foo() failed\n&quot; is not printed, because the second expression (&lt;code&gt;print &quot;foo() failed\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt;) does not need to be evaluated.

== Bitwise==

These operators perform the same operation as the logical operators, but instead of being performed on the true/false value of the entire expressions, it is done on the individual respective bits of their values.

*&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise AND)
*&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise OR)
*&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise XOR)
*&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; (bitwise NOT)

The left and right shift operators move the bits of the left operand (e.g. $a in the case of $a &lt;&lt; $b) left or right a number of times equal to the right operand ($b). Each move to the right or left effectively halves or doubles the number, except where bits are shifted off the left or right sides. For example, $number &lt;&lt; 3 returns $number multiplied by 8 (2**3).

*&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; (left shift)
*&lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (right shift)

== String ==

The string concatenation operator is &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that some other languages use.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
print 'Hello' . ' world'; # prints &quot;Hello world&quot; without a newline at the end
&lt;/source&gt;

There is a repeat operator for strings (&lt;/code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;) that repeats a string a given number of times.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $str = &quot;hi&quot;;
my $repeated_str = $str x 5;
print &quot;$repeated_str\n&quot;; # prints &quot;hihihihihi&quot; with a newline at the end
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comparing strings==
To compare strings, use &lt;code&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ne&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; respectively. You can also look for a substring with &lt;code&gt;substr()&lt;/code&gt;, or pattern-match with regular expressions.

== File Test ==

:See [[Perl Programming/Function Reference#-X]]

== Other ==
The range operator (..) returns a list of items in the range between two items; the items can be characters or numbers. The type of character is determined by the ''first'' operand; the code:
 print ('A'..'Z');
 print ('a'..'z');
 print ('A'..'z');
 print (1..'a');
 print (1..20);
 print ('&amp;'..'!');
 print (10..-10);
 print &quot;$_\n&quot; foreach (1..10);
Outputs (Newlines added for readability):
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 
 1234567891011121314151617181920
 &amp;
 
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10
Note that the case is defined by the first operand, and that the &lt;code&gt;1..'a'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(10..-10)&lt;/code&gt; operations don't return anything.

==Precedence==

Precedence is a concept that will be familiar to anyone who has studied algebra or coded in C/C++. Each operator has its place in a hierarchy of operators, and are executed in order. The precedence of perl operators is strict and should be overridden with parentheses, both when you are knowingly going against precedence and when you aren't sure of the order of precedence. For a complete listing of the order, check [http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlop.html#SYNOPSIS perlop].

==The smart match operator ==
The '''smart match operator''' &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt; is new in perl 5.10. To use it, you'll need to explicitly say that you're writing code for perl 5.10 or newer. Its opposite operator &lt;code&gt;ǃ~&lt;/code&gt; matches smartly an inequality:&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use 5.10.0; # We will be using the smart match operator

my $foo = 'low';
my $scalar = 'hi';
my @array = qw(one two three);
my %hash = (
    hi =&gt; 1,
    ho =&gt; 2,
    he =&gt; 3,
);

if ($scalar ~~ @array) { print &quot;1\n&quot;; } # Doesn't print; 'hi' isn't an element in @array
if ($scalar ~~ %hash)  { print &quot;2\n&quot;; } # Does print; 'hi' is a key in %hash
if (@array ~~ %hash)   { print &quot;3\n&quot;; } # Doesn't print; none of the elements of @array match a key in %hash

if ($foo !~ %hash) { … }
&lt;/source&gt;

The smart match operator is versatile and ''fast'' (often faster than the equivalent comparison without &lt;code&gt;ǃ~&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt;). See [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsyn.html#Smart-matching-in-detail smart matching in detail] for the comparisons it can do. &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt; is also used in the &lt;code&gt;given/when&lt;/code&gt; switch statement new in 5.10, which will be covered elsewhere.

== Dereferencing ==

=== The doubledollar ===

A variable, previously referenced with the reference operator can be dereferenced by using a doubledollar symbol prefix:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$number = 12;
$refnum = \$number; # backslash is the reference operator
$$refnum = 13; # $$ is used as a dereference to the original variable
$($refnum) = 11; # This is an alternative syntax using brackets
print $number; # the original variable has changed
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The arrow operator ===

If the left hand operand of the arrow operator is an array or hash reference, or a subroutine that produces one, the arrow operator produces a look up of the element or hash:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$result = $hashreference -&gt; {$key}; # look up a hash key from a reference variable
@arrayslice = $arrayreference -&gt; [3 .. 5]; # obtain a slice from an array reference
&lt;/source&gt;

Learning involves many activities: managing your time, taking notes, reading books, listening to lectures, memorizing, having discussions, and writing tests. We'll cover each of these activities individually, and teach you to do them more effectively. Feel free to learn the sections in any order that makes sense to you; however given that this is a text, we suggest that you start with the ''Reading Textbooks'' section.

Before you begin studying anything, there are some basic ground rules to follow:
#Desire to learn the material. If you are not motivated, you won't learn. Respicius Rwehumbiza in 2013 asserted that, Desire to learn enables you to sacrifice for study and manage time for study. It enables you to study anywhere and at any time. It creates a sense of responsibility in you about study, a sign of success. It puts you in sense of competition to learn more and more. It makes you generate new ideas and techniques for study, how to study effectively, how to concentrate and how to manage time for study
#Review the material regularly to reinforce your knowledge of the subject.
#Apply the knowledge. If you don't use it, you'll forget it sooner. 
#Introspect regularly. Set aside a specific time each week where you examine your actions for that week. Take the time to learn from your mistakes and your successes.
These instructions are distilled from the studying tips offered by Dale Carnegie in the introduction of each of his books.

==Managing Your Time==
Managing your time effectively is an important part of studying. One of the important things in time management is to do whatever works for you.  One common mistake is to try to create an overly restrictive schedule which doesn't work, and then feel very guilty that it doesn't work. Telling yourself that scheduling just doesn't work for you is another common mistake.

The following list will guide you through time management.
#Schedule - Have a regular study time and place each day - This helps put you in study mode. It's what Pavlov did with his dogs. (&quot;Good doggy. Now study! Study...&quot;).
#Prioritize - Make a list of what you have to do and list it in order of importance. Schedule the important stuff first.
#Plan your sessions - Do the difficult stuff first. That way, by the time you can barely add 1 to 1, that's all you have left to do.
#Prepare - Get everything you'll need together BEFORE you start studying. 
#Take breaks - Don't study longer than 50 minutes at a stretch. Use the other ten for a run around the block, or eat a snack. Hmm... Maybe run around the block AFTER the snack. Taking a 5-minute hot shower is another excellent solution.
#Avoid getting stuck - If you can't figure something out, skip it, and get help later. Skipping everything is not allowed.
#Divide and conquer - Break your projects up into smaller bits, and complete those bits one by one. 
#Set Milestones - Set yourself some milestones. You can also set rewards for reaching those milestones.
#Reward yourself - The reward can be small, like treating yourself to some ice cream, or larger, like buying that new outfit you've had your eye on. Rewards also don't have to cost money, like going to play some basketball with some friends at the park. Enjoy yourself when you pass a milestone, stick to your reward plans to make them more worth reaching.
#Use your time wisely - Use the days for tough activities like studying, and evenings for easier stuff like reviewing. On second thought, better schedule the latter during the day as well.
#Review regularly - We have said this before. It's important. Better read it again.
#Say &quot;No!&quot; to distractions - No matter how attractive they are unless, of course, it's on the schedule. (&quot;Proclaiming my everlasting love: Tuesday 16:25 to 16:30&quot;)

==Taking Notes==
:''NOTE: There is already a [[Note_taking]] page on Wikibooks.''
Note taking is vital when ''Reading Textbooks'' and ''Listening To Lectures''. Note taking serves a number of purposes. The least important reason is to have material for review. The real reason for note taking is to get the material to stick in your brain. By taking notes, you are actively engaging your brain in the process. And it helps keep you awake.
#Get the keys - Make notes of key words, phrases and concepts.
#Summarize - Make summaries of the keys.
#Restate - Use your own words when writing down the keys. This causes you to think about them. 
#Review - Always review. Review always. Always. Review. Get it? Now read that again.
These instructions are derived from the Cornell study method.  You can find more information about the Cornell Notes format [http://www.bucks.edu/~specpop/Cornl-ex.htm here].

===Tips===
*Don't try to substitute a tape recorder or prepared lecture notes for note taking. Remember that making a record of the lecture is the least important reason for taking notes.  
*Don't try to copy the lecture word for word. Instead try to summarize the major points. This causes you to listen actively.
*Talk to yourself in your notes. Note what is interesting, what is boring, what makes sense, and what doesn't.
*Summarize what you have learned. Some people highlight the most important sentence on each page. (Highlighting nearly every sentence on a page is a clear sign that you don't understand it.) Others keep scratch paper, and jot down a summary of every chapter - a few sentences noting the topic of that chapter and the three most important things about that topic.
*Draw diagrams in your notes, label them, and color them, if you want. Diagrams related to the lecture are what is useful.  Unrelated diagrams are merely doodles.  
*Visually organize points into groups.  Use outlines, brackets, lists, arrows, stars, boxes, circles, and others.
*Use color pens or highlighters to mark the different parts of concepts, such as key term, definition, examples, person, place or time, etc.

===Annotation system===
If you are annotating a text, for example, a scientific article, try creating an annotating code.  
The system I use is to:
*circle words or ideas I do not understand or have never seen
*put a bracket around things I wish to highlight
*underline things I especially wish to highlight
*put an angle bracket next to things I disagree with
*put an arrow next to things I find remarkable or interesting (scientific articles)
Play around with this. Let the system evolve to suit your needs.
See if colors are of any use; I personally prefer not to switch pens so I stick to blue (to contrast against the black text)

==Reading==
There are several techniques that universities advocate for studying textbooks. Most of them have the same basic structure though.
#Preview - Quickly skim over the chapter you are studying to get an overview of the material. Read headings, sub-headings, bold words, and other words that are emphasized. 
#Ask - Constantly ask yourself questions about the headings and keywords. Changing headings and keywords into questions, using who, what, where, when, and why. 
#Read - Read the first section, answering the questions you asked earlier. Note any unexpected information as well. (Think about if your questions were on target and what you need to know. Compare what you are reading with what is discussed in class.)
#Record - Take notes of your answers, of important keywords, and of important concepts. More about this in ''Taking Notes''
#Relate - Relate each section to the preceding and following sections. Relate information to your previous knowledge and experience.
#Recite - Cover your answers and notes, and recite them from heart. 
#Repeat - Repeat the Ask-Recite sequence for each section in the chapter.
#Practice - Do any practice questions and exercises in the material.
#Review - Review all your notes, and try to recite the important concepts from heart.
The above is an amalgamation of the SQ5R,the Parcer study techniques, and Plan, Do, Review. The concept at the heart of these techniques is ''active reading''. The idea is that instead of passively reading a textbook and not really paying attention, you have to actively engage your mind in the act of reading, thereby improving comprehension and retaining efficiency. The more you involve your mind in the reading, the better you'll remember.

===(Really Helpful) Tips===

*If there are words you don't understand, look them up in a dictionary or textbook related to the concept.

===Math/Science Tips===
*Instead of merely &quot;reading&quot; sample problems, look for errors in the author's work.  As you read each sentence or step, verify for yourself it is completely correct, and is a logical next step or conclusion.  
*Copy a sample problem to another sheet of paper, then see if you can solve it yourself without looking at the textbook's solution (unless you get stuck).  This makes the best use of sample problems, as students who &quot;understood the lecture&quot; or &quot;read the chapter&quot; often have difficulty doing their first problems using this new-found knowledge.  
*Reading a page of a Math/Science textbook this way may take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours, but will probably reduce your eventual study time for a quiz or test by an even greater amount.
*Understanding the main ideas of a topic does not mean you will be able to solve problems involving the topic.  Spend more time solving problems than you do reading or listening.

==Listening To Lectures==
#Prepare - Before you go to a lecture, be sure you've read any assigned reading particularly the concerning text in your study book. Go to class a little early and review the key points of the reading.
#Be on time.  Instructors often dislike having students walk in mid-way through a lecture, and you will have missed material.  Some instructors intentionally base their lecture on statements made in the first few minutes to force students to be on time. Some faculty also give key information (such as test dates) at the beginning of class.
#Take notes - Always take copious notes. See ''Taking Notes'' for tips.
#Ask questions - If you don't get something, ask.  When you ask, state what you understood the teacher to be saying, then ask whether you got it right or not.   In this way, the teacher will be able to detect what exactly you don't understand and clarify it for you.  
#Think ahead of the teacher - What are the implications of the things they are telling you?   Teachers like to steer their lecture on a subject towards the next topic in order to make a smooth transition, and thinking about the implications may give you a head start on understanding that next topic.

==Memorizing==
:''(see also a similar discussion at [[Intelligence Intensification/Memory Techniques]])''

Memorization is a serious bottle neck when studying. This bottle neck compromises one's efficiency, as it takes longer to remember new information. Memorizing lists of information is easy - once you have the techniques down. If you don't use techniques, forget it! If you don't want to invest time into learning techniques, forget it!

For subjects based on logic, such as physics, mathematics, and physiology, the best way to memorize facts is to learn a few basic facts and then learn the logic required to derive further information from those facts.  Once you work through the logic a few times, you will remember the conclusions.  These then become new &quot;basic facts&quot; upon which you can base further logic to remember more facts.  

For instance, if you want to memorize the Starling equation for the movement of fluid between blood vessels and surrounding tissue, remember that there is fluid pressure on both sides of the vessel wall and protein on both sides of the vessel wall.  Then remember that protein tends to draw water to itself by osmosis, while pressure tends to push water away.  Then just add the four opposing forces together, making the forces that tend to make water leave the blood vessel positive and the opposite forces negative.

For less logical subjects, such as history, biochemistry, and law, involving seemingly random groupings of ideas into lists, the following techniques may be more helpful.

If you must memorize a list of words or sentences, you can take the first letter of each and come up with a logical sentence involving words beginning with the same letters.  For instance, to remember the order of the planets, the mnemonic sentence &quot;My very educated mother just served us nothing&quot; is helpful... if you remember the names of the planets, and that Mercury is first, then it is easy to remember the order is &quot;Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.&quot; The fact that the mnemonic sentence is naturally set to music aids in remembering it, as the human brain remembers music more readily than speech.

Most vital are the list techniques. You start with a list of logically related persons, places, or things you can enumerate without much thought and without leaving out anything. Then you associate each of these to an item in the new list of facts to be memorized. To recall the new list, recall the old list and then the attached items.

Here are several familiar lists one could use:
#Body list - Attach items to body parts, from nose to toes for example
#Number list - Associate the shapes of numbers with items in the new list (2 - Swan, 9 - Snake, for example)
#Loci-Method - Associate each item with a point along a familiar walk, such as your route from your bed to your kitchen sink.
The most significant difference between these three is the number of items you can attach to them. The Body list is very limited, you have only one body, unless one considers attaching items to a pet's body or a friend's body as well.

Number lists are difficult to produce with more than 20 items, and difficult to learn. It's difficult to multiply them, like attaching a tire, a ball, and an egg to 0. The problem here comes when trying to assign multiple lists and getting the correct mnemonics for each list and number.

The Loci-Method might be the most powerful method. You can find items everywhere in your familiar surrounding. You can have an unlimited number of loci-lists around, your home, your university, working place, the city, your favorite bar, disco, school. If you travel to a hotel, you can create your list there, after having become familiar with it. You can create your own virtual worlds (if they're consistent) or use the scenery of a first person shooter if you're familiar enough with it.

'''&quot;Honey-tongue&quot;''' 
Cicero used this technique thousands of years ago to memorize his famous &quot;spontaneous&quot; speeches; other great thinkers did likewise. Memory experts use it to memorize 400 numbers in a row. It was usual for academics in previous centuries to have lists of several thousands of items, before even going to university. All this needs intense practice.

==Having Discussions==
One fact about learning material is that it is often a collective effort. Study groups can help you greatly when you get stuck or want to discuss the material you learned. It can also land you dates. Especially the French study group. (&quot;Ho-ho-ho, par le vous, mon ami! Je t'aime, s'il vous plaît!&quot;).

There are several ways in which study groups could go about discussing the material.
#Quiz - It's common to have people quiz each other on the material to check retention and comprehension. (&quot;Ho-ho-ho, mon ami! Telephone nombre, s'il vous plaît?&quot;)
#Debate - This is when the group goes through a part of the material and then argue about it from various angles and propose alternatives. (&quot;Non telephone? Merde! Uh... adresse s'il vous plaît?&quot;)
#School - One person is assigned the lesson and has to teach the rest then. The others can question this person on the content. (&quot;Jamais, cochon? I don't understand, could you explain that in English?&quot;)
The last method has several caveats - This method only works if everybody gets to play roles of both teacher and student. Also, be sure to pick someone that knows more than the rest do about that section. An effective technique is to have the material divided between the group members, and to have each study his section especially well before doing the school thing.

==Tests==
===Before the test===
*Before you take the test, make sure that you know as much as you can about the test.  What is the format?  What are the likely questions?  What is the grading policy?
*If there is a sample test available, it is an essential resource.  When possible, you should practice sample tests until you pass one (by your standards) on the first try. 
*If you are unfamiliar with the test location, visit it beforehand.  
*Get a good night's sleep. Eat breakfast in the morning.
*Don't think about bad situations, because it will make you more troubled in your test.

===At the start of the test===
*In a timed test, '''put your watch next to your test. It makes it easier to glance at the time without disturbing your train of thought.'''
*Look over the entire test before you start any work. This will give you some ideas about what sections to do and what sections not to work on.  Do the easy questions first. Keep in mind that in standardized tests the easy questions are usually the first ones.
*'''Read the instructions'''. Often teachers provide guidance about the best way to take the test in the instructions (point values, time suggestions).  This information is there for a reason, use it to your best advantage.

===During the test===
*Don't spend too much time on one question. Read the question thoroughly and slowly.  Make sure to read all answer options even if one seems 'obvious'.  There might be a better answer.
*Write neatly. This makes it easier on the instructor grading the test, which is always to your benefit. However, you may need to resort to scribbling in certain areas for long answers you are unsure of, as the grader is highly unlikely to read the entire answer and will probably skip that part. 
*If you get stuck, mark the question for review and go on to the next question. Subsequent questions may prompt your memory with an answer. After completing all questions, come back and review all questions. During the review you can complete all questions marked for review.
*If you are starting to freeze, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and pause for a moment.  This will help you to relax and get back on track.
*On multiple choice questions you do not know the answer to, work to eliminate any choices that are incorrect, then choose from the remaining choices.
* After completing the entire test, go back to the beginning and review your answers.  Research shows that 70% of all changed answers go from wrong to right.

===Near the end of the test===
*Unless you know that points will be taken off for wrong answers, leave nothing blank. Even if you are wildly guessing, you might get lucky.
*Even with an essay question, write what you know. A partial answer tells the teacher what you still need to learn, and may result in points (remember any points are better than none).
*Before you turn the test in, make sure that you have your name on the test.
*On standardized forms, make sure that all the pencil marks are nice and dark and in the ovals.
*On multiple choice questions that are not on standardized forms, make sure your intended answer is clear, and that you followed the teacher's guidance about how to write the answer properly.

===When you get your test back===
*Do a quick check to make sure that the numbers were added correctly and that there are no obvious mistakes in grading. In general, it is not worth the effort to challenge a grade unless there is an obvious and unarguable flaw.
*If you have questions about why something is wrong, ask the instructor. You should not go to your instructor to get points back on the test, but to gain a better understanding of the material and to be better prepared for future tests.
*Use the test as a study guide. Focus on both what you got right and what you got wrong.

==Writing Term Papers==
===Skills=== 
In ''Helping Your Teen-Age Student'', Dr. Marvin Cohn says that students often leap prematurely into a topic and engage in hasty, laborious note-taking that does not contribute to the finished paper.  Sampling a variety of books and taking time to think about possible research projects should come before writing, he says.  It is clearly best to know, before deciding on a topic, that ample sources are available for a given topic. While surveying available sources, the student should take note of which sources seem useful and also which ones do not.  That prevents the student from looking at undesirable sources twice.  A book that seems interesting should be noted by its title, author, location, and some description – a paragraph about one of its chapters, for example.  When there is more than one book available on the same subject, the student might compare the books on the basis of some common feature.  For example, with a set of George Washington biographies the student can compare the accounts of Washington’s Winter at Valley Forge.  Much can be learned about a book by reading less than one of its pages – for example, how well the author makes points, organizes material, and uses language clearly.  As a rule, it is best for the student, early in the project, to find one especially good source and rely on that as a guide throughout.          

The reading can be described in terms of three activities, which students generally undertake in the following order.  

1. overview – getting a general idea of a subject by reading encyclopedia articles or by skimming through books, especially books that deal with the subject in a general way  

2. study – reading books and articles the way students read their textbooks, using not just introductory texts but ones that deal with specific aspects of the topic 

3. fact-finding – searching for details, answers to questions that have been raised by the research
              
Taking notes in the student’s own words is protection from accidental plagiarism.  Also, rephrasing is good because it makes the student think about the text.  Copying quotations from authors is the exception to the rule.  It is agreed that the paper should have no more quotations than are necessary, but that does not mean, necessarily, that notes should not have many quotations.  As the collection of notes increases, it’s natural, says Dr. Cohn, for the student to start writing observations in the form of sentences and perhaps paragraphs.  

As reading and note-taking continues, a set of main points may occur to the student, in which case they should be jotted down.  Perhaps later they will be written in a different order.  The list is the origin of the outline.  Its writing may be compared with the growth of a young tree.  From the main points are derived two or more lesser points, and from the lesser points two or more details, and so on.  The general rule that a new task should not be started with immediately after finishing one applies here.  It is best to stop writing after finishing work on an outline.  More recent books on study mention the mind map (below).   A student might make one of these these informal diagrams to help in developing ideas.  They can be useful as a method of studying information on a topic before outlining.

A paper is only a series of paragraphs, and learning how to write a paragraph well adds much to the quality of a writer’s work.  In English writing, most paragraphs begin with a sentence that has the paragraph’s main idea.  Occasionally, a paragraph’s main idea is found in its final sentence.  The main idea of the paragraph is supported by its other sentences. The simple rule of not writing sentences or paragraphs that are too long makes the paper more readable, and the writer should know when to divide lengthy sentences and paragraphs into smaller ones.  Unless it is needed, a technical or unusual word should be replaced with a common word, or at least explained in the writing.         
===The research and writing process===
The research project cannot be divided into a series of clearly-defined steps.  There is overlap.  In a student’s survey of possible resources, there is some note-taking, if only to identify books and articles.  Note-taking often gives way to students writing observations of their own, perhaps in writing sentences or paragraphs. With the increase of material comes a need to organize it as an outline, or to develop ideas by making a mind map, before starting on an outline.   The outline begins as a simple list of main points.  Outlines can be written different ways, consisting of phrases, sentences, or connected sentences.  Whereas some will write a first draft based on a fairly informal outline, others with keep adding details to the outline until is basically the first draft.  In writing the first draft, some will write parts quickly, without much attention to spelling and grammar, and slow down at other parts to write finished prose.  Others will use formal language from start to finish. With all papers, it is best to re-read the work carefully and spot all errors, no matter how small.  When the paper is graded, little errors add up.  A traditional method of proofreading is to put the paper  away for a few days, then read it with “new eyes.”
===An exercise for the beginner=== 
In ''How to Double Your Child’s Grades in School'', author Eugene Schwartz presents an exercise intended to make the transition from writing short essays to writing a first term paper less frustrating.  Instead of the usual bibliography, he suggests working with no more than two or three easily-read books.  When the student becomes familiar with them, the student answers a series of questions, including the question of which ideas should be the main points to be made, and also which points should be excluded from the brief paper.  Students are advised to begin the paper by making an especially good point and to write a good final sentence, these established before work on the first draft. The exercise consists of eight questions.

==Alternative Techniques==
===Study Technologies===
Each person has a certain learning style, which can only be discovered through experience. A mix of new technologies can enhance your learning experience. Here are some avenues to explore:

====Text to Speech====
If you are studying a text that is available as a text file or on the Internet, you can probably convert it into a spoken-word presentation at little or no cost. But don't just listen to it -- for best results, read and listen at the same time. A multi sensory experience has more impact. Also, listening to spoken text while reading it deals with a little-known problem of modern readers, who tend to skim and skip even while they think they are reading. 

The text-to-speech programs that can be found on sites such as download.com (search with key words &quot;text&quot; and &quot;speech&quot;) have come a long way from the emotionless computerized voices of yesterday. Text Aloud is the name of one such program among many.  An open source text to speech program can be found [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sayzme/ here].

====Mind Mapping====
Many schools have tried to teach students outlining skills. The ability to &quot;write down the bones&quot; of a body of knowledge was thought to be a key to understanding it. With the advent of personal computers, elaborate outlining programs were released which tried to minimize the drudgery involved, but the outlining fad faded out. (A very simple, useful, and inexpensive software outlining program is Vault, available for evaluation [http://www.swreg.org/soft_shop/2423/shopscr2.shtml here])

A very easy-to-use free open-source Java-based mind mapping style application is [http://freemind.sourceforge.net/ Freemind]. It is important when you first learn about mind mapping to practice determining keywords, one per link in your mind map. See [http://www.geosoc.org/schools/pass/memory/memmindmap.htm The Difference in Taking Notes].

For the more artistically impaired or lazy, the Mindjet corporation has created &quot;Mind Manager&quot; which uses the same techniques you may have seen in organization charts to help map out ideas with graphic components. This very useful program is also beyond the budgets of many, but an evaluation copy is available [http://www.mindjet.com here].

Some school districts have become quite smitten with mind-mapping technology. Portions of the Los Angeles Unified School District have standardized on Inspiration. An alternate version, Kidspiration, is designed for lower elementary grades. Evaluation copies are available at [http://www.inspiration.com Inspiration.com].

====Speech to Text====
You can take your lecture notes and convert them into typed text with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which translates your speech into typing. This is the best speech-to-text program currently available; its main rival, IBM's ViaVoice, has fallen by the wayside. NaturallySpeaking comes in various versions; the most useful is NaturallySpeaking Professional, which is quite expensive, but allows you to create macros, and thus fire off a series of complicated instructions with just a word or two. Most users settle for NaturallySpeaking Preferred, the much cheaper but still useful version.  More details are available [http://www.scansoft.com here].

===Independent study===
Often getting ahead in school involves independent study of subjects related to your coursework. While this may be intimidating to most of us who have been trained to rely on a teacher's guidance, the benefits of engaging in independent scholarship are well worth the effort. 

Benefits of independent scholarship include:

*More individualized content
*Quicker and more efficient coverage of the material
*Improving of study skills overall
*self-directed study helps you to discover your personal learning style
*the skills gained from independent study can be applied to your other coursework. these skills include time management, organization, research and writing skills, and engaging creatively with the material.
*can help you explore your interests, and might even lead to a change in major
*concepts from one course area can be used to think creatively about others, such as psychology, anthropology, sociology; can be studied as an interdisciplinary major

The only downside to independent study is that you may not receive official credit for your work. If this is an issue for you, you can choose to study towards a certain test that will advance your academic career. However, know that most professors would be thrilled to have people in their classes who have read widely concerning the subject matter, and have something original to contribute to class discussions. So many students are just there because they have to get a degree to get a job, and the professors will be impressed that you studied subjects on your own just for learning's sake. You can also receive credit for independent study from the CLEP, or college level examination program. Check with your school to see what their policy on CLEP is.

Self-directed study involves a dramatic paradigm shift wherein one is responsible for one's own learning. It is a great test of one's will power and determination, and depends on your attitude toward the subject and towards learning in general. 

In ordinary school learning is seen as building up the major concept from smaller ideas.  For example, one learns how to do individual tasks in algebra and then comes later to the realization of the nature of the overall idea of algebra. 

Self-directed learning demands the opposite, that you first grasp the main idea of the subject area you wish to study and then fill in all the blanks. It is a skill that takes time to develop.

==Ideas==
If you are taking a comprehensive general course such as European culture, or anatomy and physiology, or anything with a lot of different kinds of facts to learn, a useful tool is to buy a set of highlighters. Use one color only for definitions, another color for locations and dates (a date is a location in time), another color for processes, and so on. You can get matching colored post-it notes and write the facts on them and associate them with places in your house (such as on the bathroom mirror, closet door) and read the post-it aloud as you go past. Be sure to keep the post-it note colors consistent with your highlighter color scheme!

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Moe45673. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Moe45673~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''chord structure''', also called a '''chord progression''' or '''harmonic progression''', helps indicate where the melody should go.

==The purpose of chord structures==
It can be argued that many forms of music are organic, while imposing a rigid &quot;structure&quot; can be hampering. This is a legitimate concern. However, consider that rigid chord structures occur most often in improvisational music (especially jazz), which is usually not rigid in itself. Furthermore, many composers do not consider chord structures much when composing, perhaps trying various things out and just going with what works, or maybe simply having an intuitive understanding of the structures involved. Knowledge of chord structures will help you communicate with other musicians, but is not a ''must'' for participating in any kind of jam session. Jamming can begin and end anywhere either with or without structure.

==Common chord structures==
By far the most common chord structures revolve around, or at least contain, the I, IV, and V chords. This is why it is important to know the Roman Numerals for these scale degrees: they pop up a lot! Many songs use ''only'' these three chords (and possibly variations of them). The first we will consider is the classic twelve bar blues based on the 'Blue Scale'.

==The twelve bar blues==
The twelve bar blues, despite its name, pops up in a variety of genres, from [[../Jazz|jazz]] to [[../Rock|rock]]. It has been used in a many great songs, such as the theme from the Batman television show. Its most basic structure is this:

  I  I  I  I
  IV IV I  I
  V7 IV I  I
The roman numerals are also used for different songs. e.g E E E E / A A E E / B A E E. This can be used for any chords but you must use the same pattern repeatedly.
That is, the first four bars are the I chord, the next two the IV chord, the next two the I chord again, and so on. It begins on the tonic and ends on the tonic, which is common in many progressions. ''Many chord progressions start at the tonic, move away to somewhere else, only to come back to the tonic.'' To complicate this, however, twelve bar blues structures sometimes feature a ''turnaround'' at the end, meaning the very last bar is a V7 chord, or it has a I chord followed by a V7 chord. Turnarounds usually occur at the end of a verse or some other section in preparation for the next section. Usually the very last bar of a song will not have a turnaround.

In some genres, such as jazz, seventh chords occur more commonly, so the basic twelve-bar blues might become something more like this:

  I  I   I  I7
  IV IV7 I  I7
  V7 IV  I7 I

It can also be modified further. For instance, the tenth bar (the last occurrence of IV) might become another V7 chord. This alteration was often used when adapting the twelve-bar blues to rock and roll.

==The II-V-I==

In jazz, the [[w:II-V-I|II-V-I]] is probably the most common chord progression. As its name indicates, it goes:

  IIm7 V7 Imaj7

As always, the exact type of chords can be modified to give a different feeling, such as in this [[w:minor scale|melodic minor]], ascending form only, version:

  IIm7b5(9) V7alt Imaj7

Note: Only the IIm7b5(9) and V7alt chords are from melodic minor scales.

==The Minor II-V-I==
Another commonly used chord progression is the minor ii-V-i. One can derive this from the melodic minor scales shown above, while substituting a IminMaj7 for the IMaj7 chord, or by using three [[w:modes|modes]] from one [[w:harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]] , which produces the following chord progression:

  IIm7b5(b9) V7b9(b13) IminMaj7(b6)

==Applications of II-V-I's==
II-V-Is can be chained together, creating complex progressions. Here's an example:

  C      Bm7b5 E7   (I     II  V)
  Am7    Dm7   G7   (I     II  V)
  C      (etc...)   (I     etc..)

An example of complicated progression that can be created this way is the [[w:Coltrane Changes|&quot;Coltrane Changes&quot;]], where the &quot;I&quot; chords move by Major 3rd intervals. Here's a simple example:

  Dm7  G7  Cmaj7    (II V I  )
  F#m7 B7  Emaj7    (II V I  )
  Bbm7 Eb7 Abmaj7   (II V I  )
  Dm7  etc...       (I etc...)

The way the II-V-I progression works is that first the II chord moves by 4ths upwards, which very often produces interesting results, and then when moving from the V chord to the I chord the 7th of the V chord descends a half step and becomes the 3rd of the I chord.

II-V-I progressions can also be used in other styles, such as classical.

==Two-chord structures==
Two-chord structures are much simpler than three-chord structures, of course. However, they are harder to work with! It is more difficult to write an interesting piece with fewer chords, therefore the musicians must get the most they can out of them.

==One-chord structures==
One-chord &quot;structures&quot; are uncommon, but they do exist. For instance, Frere Jacques is a one-chord song because it can be played against a single major chord. More contemporary examples are &quot;On the Road Again&quot; by Canned Heat, numerous [[../Hip Hop|rap]] songs, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This is a basic introduction to chords. There is also a [[../Complete List of Chord Patterns|complete chord reference]].''

'''[[w:en:chord|Chords]]''' are the vertical arrangement of notes from a scale. The study of chords is called Harmony. Harmony is concerned with how one or more notes interact, and how they follow each other. Many people define chords as several notes played simultaneously. It must be pointed out that it is possible to play music of a chordal nature on the flute, trumpet, or a lone human voice, all three being monophonic instruments. Since obviously monophonic instruments cannot play a stacked chord where the notes are sounded simultaneously; the chords are implied. A simpler way of viewing this is that when chord tones are played as an arpeggio on a monophonic instrument the human ear interprets that there is a harmonic structure. We therefore define a chord as ''the basic element of harmony''. To start with we will look at examples of the most basic chord,  the triad.

==Triads==
The ''triad'' is a class of chords, specifically three-note chords formed by this formula: 1-3-5 or root, third, fifth. In this example they are constructed of two consecutive thirds.  

There are four kinds: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Kinds of Triads
! !! Root !! 3rd !! 5th
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Major
| 1 || 3 || 5
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Minor
| 1 || ♭3 || 5
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Augmented
| 1 || 3 || #5
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Diminished
| 1 || ♭3 || ♭5
|- 
| align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot; | ''♭=flat/lowered; #=sharp/raised''
|}


The major is very [[../Consonance and Dissonance|consonant]]; the minor is a bit less so but still consonant for most purposes. The augmented is very dissonant and the diminished is ''extremely'' dissonant as it contains a tritone (augmented fourth or, in this case, diminished fifth).

The major and minor triads may have their third omitted, although this is uncommon. If the third of a major or minor chord is omitted, the result is a ''fifth chord'', which is often called a ''power chord'' when played on an overdriven guitar.

==Triads and Inversions==
If we look at a C major ''triad'' or three-voice chord it is based on combining a root voice (C) with two other voices at slightly different intervals of a third (E, a major third from C and G, a minor third from E). If we compare the ''key'' of C major to the C major chord using the names ''do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si,'' to represent the [[Wikipedia:Degree_(music)|''scale degrees'']] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the C major chord is constructed from the notes '''do''', '''mi''', and '''so'''. This same relationship is true for all major triads in all corresponding major keys.

These three notes (the root, major third and perfect fifth)  can be structured or 'voiced', C-E-G, E-G-C or G-C-E. No matter what order the three notes (called voices) are in they still create a C major chord.  It does not matter if the voices are the singers in a choir or the instruments of an orchestra, if the notes are all either C, E, or G we simply have a gigantic sounding C chord. 

The two consecutive intervals produced by these voicings would be:
*C E G = major third, minor third (''root pos'n''), 
*E G C = minor third, perfect fourth (''1st inv.''),
*G C E = perfect fourth, major third (''second inv.'').

If the root (C) is on the bottom this voicing is called ''root position''. If the third (E) is on the bottom it is called ''first inversion''. If the fifth (G) is on the bottom this voicing of the triad is called ''second inversion''. 

Since there are only three possible voicings of a triad it is relatively easy to hear them in that they are a common feature of the past two centuries of traditional harmonic structures in Western music. The use of the exponentially more complex voicings arising from 4-voice, 5-voice and larger chords is more challenging. Some 4-voice chords are used in traditional, 'classical' and church music but others such as the ''diminished seventh'' were strictly forbidden in early sacred music as they contained the tritone interval; the mathematical halfway point in the octave which acquired the name ''diabolus in musica'' (the Devil in music) due to its dissonant qualities. Other 4-voice chords were not used in symphonic and 'classical' music until the French Impressionist era and in modern jazz. All triads and 4-voice chords are built within the octave, or eight-note scale which encompasses the do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do of the major scale, for instance, or the scale steps 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8; eight being the octave where the pattern starts over again.

All triadic and therefore, common, chords can be constructed the same way : using the 1 3 5 formula. Take the C scale, for instance, [use &quot;Rel. name&quot; in a sentence in which &quot;Rel.&quot; is not abbreviated] :

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Building Harmonizing Chords in the Scale of C Major 
! Degree&lt;br&gt;1 2 3 4 5 !! Chord&lt;br&gt;Name !! 1-3-5&lt;br&gt;Triad !! Rel.&lt;br&gt;Name 
|- align=&quot;center&quot; | bgcolor=&quot;silver&quot;
| C D E F G || C Major || C E G || I
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| D E F G A || D Minor || D F A || iim
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| E F G A B || E Minor || E G B || iiim
|- align=&quot;center&quot; | bgcolor=&quot;silver&quot;
| F G A B C || F Major || F A C || IV
|- align=&quot;center&quot; | bgcolor=&quot;silver&quot;
| G A B C D || G Major || G B D || V
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| A B C D E || A Minor || A C E || vim
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| B C D E F || B Diminished || B D F || viidim
|}

This works for any scale, and whether the chord formed is minor or major depends on the scale: the I, IV, V chords are major, and the rest are minor, with the seventh being diminished.

==Intervals==
All chords are made up of interlocking or overlapping intervals. An interval may be defined as the distance between two notes. The names of the chords are derived from the intervals that they are built from.
In order of smallest to largest the ascending intervals (and distance in semitones) within the octave from a middle C would be as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Intervals
! Interval !! Note !! Semitones
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Minor 2nd || D♭ || 1
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Major 2nd || D || 2
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Minor 3rd || E♭ || 3
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Major 3rd || E || 4
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Perfect 4th || F || 5
|- align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;silver&quot;
| Augmented 4th&lt;br&gt;Diminished 5th || F#&lt;br&gt;G♭ || 6¹²
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Perfect 5th || G || 7
|- align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;silver&quot;
| Augmented 5th&lt;br&gt;Minor 6th || G#&lt;br&gt;A♭ || 8¹
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Major 6th || A || 9
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Minor 7th || B♭ || 10
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Major 7th || B || 11
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Octave (8th) || C || 12
|- 
| align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;3&quot; | ''1.  Shaded interval pairs are enharmonic;&lt;br&gt;one interval with two names.&lt;br&gt;2. The ''Tritone'' is six semitones.''
|}


The dreaded ''tritone'', six semitones up from the root (and six down from the octave), is harmonically bewildering, being neither fish nor fowl, exactly halfway from nowhere; one interval with two names (enharmonic in 12-tone equal temperament), the augmented 4th and the diminished 5th.  Likewise, the enharmonic augmented 5th and minor 6th are eight semitones up from the root. 

By observing that 2nds, 3rds, 6ths and 7ths are always either ''major'' or ''minor'' and 4ths and 5ths are always ''perfect'', ''augmented'' (raised) or ''diminished'' (lowered) it becomes evident that major chords have a major 3rd, minor chords have a minor third. By altering or manipulating these intervals by raising or lowering the third, fifth, seventh, and so on, all of the possible chords can be produced.

Some examples: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Some Example Chords
! Voices !! Name
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| 1 3 5 || Major
|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| 1 3 #5 7 || Major 7th +5
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| 1 3 #5 ♭7 || Dominant 7th +5
|}

==Applying chords==
The easiest way to apply a triad, or indeed any chord, is to pick one on a polyphonic instrument (such as a piano) and play its three notes simultaneously. This is often how chords occur in actual music: an instrument plays all the notes in the chord at the same time. However, there are other possibilities. The simplest is to ''arpeggiate'' the chord, that is, to play its notes one at a time in any order, especially in a ascending or descending order. Often melody can be written around the chord, using notes in the chord as well as the diatonic and chromatic passing notes between the chord tones. When this is done while there is no accompaniment actually playing a chord, the chord is ''implied''.

==Seventh chords==
Triads are often extended with some form of the seventh to form a ''[[w:en:seventh chord|seventh chord]]''. When a chord is referred to as simply a seventh chord, usually the ''dominant seventh'' is meant, which is a major triad with a minor seventh, for instance, C-E-G-B♭. It is called the dominant seventh because the V chord, or &quot;dominant chord&quot; in the Latin naming system, is the only major chord in the major scale that can naturally contain a minor seventh. Because all sevenths are dissonant intervals, any seventh chord is dissonant, in other words, a seventh chord is more tense than a major or minor chord. However, a few styles of music, such as [[../Jazz|jazz]], make heavy use of seventh chords and may treat them as rather consonant.

==Other chords==
Some chords are defined by the relation to the key rather than by any inherent characteristics. The Neapolitan chord, for example, is an ordinary major chord, but its root is the lowered supertonic of the corresponding key, so the Neapolitan of C major is a D♭ major chord. Additionally, the Neapolitan is usually found in first inversion. A borrowed chord is one from the parallel major or minor key. In C major, the parallel key is C minor and borrowed chords include E♭ major, B♭ major, and F minor.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Alfwatt. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Alfwatt~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Move to enforced==

The vote at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Deletion_Policy vote for deletion policy] showed consensus. The discussion of a move to enforced at the staff lounge was unopposed. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== Removing &quot;Blatant vandalism&quot; from SD criteria ==

Currently we have these two among the criteria for SD:
: ''A page with no [[#Meaningful content|meaningful content]]. Always check the history of the page, as this nonsense may have replaced good content. If this is the case, simply revert to the last good version.''
and
: ''Blatant vandalism. This would be obvious offensive language or completely unrelated content to the Wikibook it is associated with. Make sure that the page that has been vandalized does not have prior history that can simply be reverted, then blank the page and add the deletion tag.''

&quot;Meaningful content&quot; includes:
: ''Vandalism (including linkspamming)''

I think the former criteria sufficiently includes the latter which I propose we remove. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

: ''' Agree '''. The shorter policy pages are the better (in general anyway). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:44, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

: Vandalism isn't really defined under &quot;Meaningful content&quot; as it is for Blatant vandalism. I think perhaps either the definition of vandalism as defined by the blanant vandalism definition should be combined with vandalism definition under &quot;Meaningful content&quot; or it should be expanded to include an alternative definition of vandalism. Without a vandalism definition it is up to interpretation of what vandalism is and leaving vandalism undefined from this policy may not be a good idea as there seems to be some efforts by other contributors to Wikibooks to try to define other unwanted contents in addition to whats already in this policy. Perhaps we could also change the section name to &quot;No meaningful content&quot;? As it is now the name is misleading when what is pointed out is examples of what is not meaningful content rather then what is meaningful content. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:44, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

:'''Oppose'''. It's a small change, and while the one might be implied in the definition of the other, I can't see any reason to remove a small amount of text at the expense of removing clarity. Wiki isn't paper, remember, and we can afford to be a little verbose now and again. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:'''Oppose''' - As the author who put this phrase into the speedy delete criteria, I wanted to be very plain about the fact that you don't have to hold a VfD over vandalism.  There is content that has been added as a deliberately malicious nature sometimes to a page, and an admin should have the authority to get rid of this stuff.  It may be &quot;meaningful content&quot; in some sense of the word, but the person who added it is clearly trying to cause problems for the main contributors of the module or Wikibook.  Yes, this is something that requires good judgement, which is one of the reasons why we get so paranoid about accepting new admins and often turn down requests for adminship.  In most cases the vandalism is so obvious that having a second admin review it is more than sufficient, if there is cause to doubt the actions of a particular admin.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Moving Content of books ==
I take this &lt;del&gt;change&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;chance&lt;/ins&gt; to ask that when people move text out of books (even if they get deleted) should give the right credits on the destination work as requested by the GFDL. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: &quot;I take this change to ask...&quot; I don't understand what you've just said. What change? Could you rephrase?

:: Sorry. change -&gt; chance :), besides my normal error level, I have now the flue :)...
:: This refers to (GFDL on 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS), as I it seems to me that most users that move pages from books to books do that without regards to that stipulation. Another point that should be useful to state on the policy it that even if books are deleted on Wikibook there are other servers that can have the old content replicated. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

::: I agree that GFDL documents mustn't break the license ... but what does that have to do with [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]? This policy concerns itself with the criteria and process of removing pages; not combining them. A little context to your suggestion would be useful.

:::: It relates to ''Guidelines for admins'', it should be added there as a reminder to admins merging content, nothing more.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

::: &quot;''there are other servers that can have the old content replicated.''&quot; I don't see any reason whatsoever for including this in the page. If you really think it is important, please start a new section for it. 
::: Hope your flue gets better! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:21, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: Most people may interpret that by a decision to delete here, the content is '''destroyed''' it can prove advantageous not only to refer that other systems do mirror the content but that the user is free to copy it elsewhere under the GFDL license, this can ease the affected user disposition regarding a passed decision to delete. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:35, 3 January 2007 (UTC)
:::::I agree with that sentiment, We should make it more clear that content deleted here, since it is under the GFDL, is free to be copied or transferred to another location. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Vote and changes ==
Any call for a vote or the approval of this policy must be depend on the approval of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], this should also be stated on it's text as it may depend on the this other policy. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: This policy has already [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Deletion_policy&amp;diff=471583&amp;oldid=462789 been approved]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 21:34, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Well that change is a state of fact, there wouldn't be a need for a formal proposal (on that change) but I came here from a link that stated that it the policy was under discussion... Sorry, but my point remains valid, do you think it changes the actual intention of the policy and a proposal is needed ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I dont think this policy needs to be altered or updated unless blatant problems can be found in it (and I can't see any on quick inspection). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

This policy has been formally approved for some time, and I was involved with the decision.  [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Deletion Policy|This is the actual page]] where the voting took place, and IMHO similar kinds of votes should also happen.  All of this said, there is some concern over what was voted on and the current state of this policy.  [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Deletion_policy&amp;diff=cur&amp;oldid=366253 See this diff] to compare what has changed from the version that was voted upon.  While most of what has been modified is relatively benign and insignificant, there are a few points that did make some major policy changes that have crept in.  Those changes IMHO are something that can and should be debated upon.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:I think the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policy precludes the use of large, elaborate voting mechanisms as were used when this policy was accepted. Many of the changes that you point out in that diff link were discussed, either in this talk page, or in other locations before they were enacted. In general, I think a less-formal system is far preferred over all sorts of formal nonsense anyway (special voting pages, etc). Regardless, I can't imagine that we need to put the currently accepted text of this policy to a new vote to confirm it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:01, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
----
To avoid confusing and restatement of the points, the actual policy should be reverted and the now changed text (contested) should be moved to an unstable version of the same policy (I will also add my proposed changes later) and in the talk page should be stated that the text should be analyzed and debated but a formal approval will only be performed after the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policy is closed. Any one disagrees ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:I would disagree, I dont think the text of the page should be reverted unless specific points are challenged. Keep in mind that wikibookians are encouraged to '''be bold''', and many changes, edits, and improvements are instituted by bold wikibookians trying to fix problems without alot of hassle. By all means, create an unstable version if you want (i have some things to add and change as well), but dont revert the current text of the policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:47, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Yup I do agree with you, but under the ''be bold'' if a user should make a substantial change to a policy, the points shouldn't be challenged, the opposing user should revert and state why, if the originator of the change should find that the reversion did in some way reduced the advancement of a point or he wishes to propose that point for adoption then he should make an unstable version to propose the change. On simple terms it is up to the one that wants to push a change to get the trouble of defending it, other Wikibookians should prevent any changes that alters the spirit of the adopted policy on the active policy page. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== Why == 

Why did Jimbo Wales order the removal of video game guides from WikiBooks?  You can reach me on Wikipedia's [[w:user:100110100|100110100]]; a response there would be greatly appreciated, thanks![[User:70.74.35.252|70.74.35.252]] 07:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:It wasn't so much an order by Jimbo as it was a manifestation of policy. Videogame strategy guides don't qualify as textbooks under [[WB:WIW|the inclusion criteria]], although exceptions have been made in the past. Jimbo's statements weren't so much a mandate against videogame  guides as they were a reaffirmation of our pre-existing policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::I strongly disagree on this point.  It was not pre-existing policy, as there was no policy that even governed the concept.  It wasn't even an exception to a particular inclusion policy.  It was a few admins that  took the words of (and IMHO mis-interpreted the suggestion of) Jimbo and did a mass deletion of Wikibooks content.  Jimbo did come swinging onto Wikibooks and said that in his opinion they didn't belong here.  And he tried to give several point that from his perspective, including a violation of the the Wikibooks charter.  But when they were first removed it was in violation of this policy on this page, in both the spirit and the letter here.  And general consensus within the Wikibooks community on this issue was never achieved.  I still don't think it has, other than almost all of the supporters of keeping the video game books have been driven from Wikibooks instead.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The current text of WB:WIW is essentially the same as it was before Jimbo made his declaration. Some of the vaguarities, especially over the videogame guide issue, are the prime impetus to the new draft of that policy. If you look at the current text of WB:WIW, you will see a number of strong points that can be used to ban videogame strategy guides. Those guides were not banned, as they should have been, both because of rampant inclusionism, and the fact that wikibooks had been used as a dumping ground for lots of inappropriate material early in it's lifetime. The mistakes of the past, while they do form some sort of tradition or inertia, hardly make the fact &quot;not so&quot;. Video game guides never really belonged here, nobody ever had the backbone to just kick them out. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::::The video game books were not things that were &quot;dumped&quot; onto Wikibooks.  I could name several items that were dumped here, but that was not among the problems mentioned here.  Jimbo did change WB:WIW spontaneously and without discussion, and furthermore even after he changed the wording there, he didn't really explain what the change really meant or what the implications of that change would have for the project.  It also created a huge firestorm of discussion for trying to &quot;divine&quot; the implications of the policy change, as Jimbo simply didn't say what he really meant other than three particular books had to be deleted.  It was if the policy was to delete those books alone on his authority.  And video game books were not on that list.
::::Again, Jimbo did suggest that the books didn't belong on Wikibooks, but at the same time concensus simply did not occur.  The books were simply deleted.  In regards to the rampant inclusionism, Wikibooks has been narrowing the defintion of what was included here for some time.  But that process was one of a more gradual process.  I will admit that the video game books did have significant opposition even before Jimbo came in and stirred up the pot, and it is possible that they may have eventually gone without Jimbo's interference.  But to say that video game books never really belonged here and there was no support nor legitmate arguments in favor of keeping them on Wikibooks is very much missing the true feelings of Wikibooks at the time.
::::My strongest objection to what happened was that this policy was never even followed (and it did exist at the time!)  Books were simply deleted without any discussion, and on the presumed authority of Jimbo.  It wasn't until I started complaining that VfDs were started at all.  And it should be very apparent from the VfDs of the time that substantial books were indeed voted off of this project and whole categories of books (like fiction) were removed as well.  But it as done with widespread concensus.  This did not happen with the video game guides.  That video game books still exist on Wikibooks should be a testament that this concensus simply didn't happen, but that the contributors of those books were kicked off by aggressive administrators.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::Administrators do not need community consensus to delete manifest policy violations. Certainly consensus in those situations is a nice formality, but it isnt strictly required. It's why we have a category for speedy deletions in parallel to our normal VfD mechanism. Things on which there is no doubt about the inappropriateness of inclusion here can be deleted without first acquiring community consensus. The deletion policy says &quot;when in doubt, nominate at VFD&quot;, which expressly leaves open an option for issues when there is no doubt.  Jimbo did not need to explain his inclusion on the WB:WIW policy, the purpose and the implications were self evident: videogame guides do not belong here, and they should be deleted. When the oldest wikibookians agreed on the original text of WB:WIW (or the equivalent, since that's not what it was called), and agreed that wikibooks was for textbooks and not all manner of written work, consensus was acheived on this issue. We dont need community consensus again to confirm the text of that policy, it stands until the community agrees on a new version of it. Videogame guides always have been inappropriate here, and it was the fault of lazy admins in the past that they weren't removed like they should have been. the &quot;aggressive admins&quot; of the present time (of which I am proud to call myself a member) are simply following policy and making wikibooks a better place because of it.
:::::Let's get one thing straight here: video game guides are not and never will be considered &quot;textbooks&quot;. The fact that they were included here previously was a gross misjudgment by early wikibookians, and we are still dealing with that mess today. In all your complaints about this issue, Rob, you haven't once given good reason as to why videogame guides should not be summarily deleted. You talk about people not achieving consensus on the matter, you talk about the rashness of the decision, and you talk about Jimbo's lack of authority to make that call, but you are ignoring the fact that ''it was the right thing to do''.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::Again, to suggest that there is a ''right'' thing to do is patently false because we are not dealing with an ethical decision. There are opinions about what action is most acceptable, but there is not a &quot;right&quot; or a &quot;wrong&quot; course of action. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:48, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::I'm not implying it's an ethical decision, perhaps i should have used the word &quot;correct&quot; instead of &quot;right&quot;. Choice of vocabulary not withstanding, you aren't addressing the issue here: Videogame guides are not textbooks, and they should not be on wikibooks. Me using the wrong word doesnt make the point less valid. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

I strongly disagree with the general statement &quot;because this seems like the best place for them doesn't mean that we should allow them here.&quot;
Always put stuff at the best place for that stuff.
And there is always a place somewhere for sincere, well-intended stuff[http://communitywiki.org/OnAndOffTopic].
If wikibooks is the best place for some text, then by all means, put that text on wikibooks.

However, I agree with the specific statement that video game strategy guides don't belong on wikibooks.
Video game strategy guides don't belong here, because there are much better places for them.

The next person who starts thinking about writing yet another video game guide on Wikibooks -- is there a better way to redirect him to one of these better locations for his efforts?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:52, 19 December 2007 (UTC)
:We normally direct people to [[StrategyWiki:|StrategyWiki:]], but people are free to take the content to any of the above. The problem is that Wikibooks often ''seems'' like the best place to put content that doesn't belong on Wikipedia - if it doesn't fit inside their inclusion policy, it often ends up here. In the exact same way that Wikipedia has a strong inclusion policy, so too does Wikibooks, and it doesn't include video game guides (among other things). Each wiki has a specific scope, and you can't just dump content into any arbitrary wiki without regard for their inclusion policy. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:30, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== User Pages ==

I was under the impression that this policy contained mention of the fact that userpages may not be used to circumvent a VfD discussion. That is, when we vote to delete a book through VfD, that a person may not copy the book into their userspace and continue work on it from there. I would like to propose adding the following text to the VfD section:
:''A person's user and user talk pages may not be used to store copies of pages deleted through VfD. User pages may not be used to circumvent VfD or other community decisions or site policies.''
What use is VfD anyway if people can simply move deleted material to the User: namespace, and continue working on it as usual? Furthermore, if VfD, we are typically voting for the deletion of ''content'', not simply the deletion of particular pages. This would imply that the community is voting to delete the material regardless of what page or pages it is located on. Furthermore, while it hasn't happened in a long time, I'm decently certain that this kind of action has some precidence. although I need to find evidence of that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:22, 17 December 2007 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''{{{2|Support}}}''' - I'd love to see that added. In the case which prompted this, there was a pre-existing draft in the userspace, so that wasn't actually an attempt to sidestep the VFD. It should be deleted, however. The author can keep the content, just not on Wikibooks (including their userspace). I think you're correct that this has happened in the past, though I'm not sure where. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:27, 17 December 2007 (UTC)

: &quot;''A page which has been transwikied to more appropriate wiki, and is considered to be against one or more policies here.''&quot;
Pages that go against policy should be deleted whether they have been transwikied out or not. If someone could point out if there was some nuance intended here, this point could use a clarification. If it's just a redundant criteria that slipped in, we might as well remove it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:40, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

:: In the past works have been transwikied despite being perfectly within the scope of Wikibooks.

== Edits and fixed version ==
I recently made 2 edits:&lt;br&gt;
1- one very small, removed the word vote as per the now used language &lt;s&gt;and I expect more in accordance to what was intended in the original text.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2- a somewhat confused duplication of what is written on the active [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]].

I also find that I don't remember this policy being so pro-consensus (the true concept of it) and as is I can point several instances where the policy has been broken, can anyone point to the original approved version ?

To clarify. I like the policy text as it is but I think that it is not what has been applied and probably not what was approved.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:54, 18 November 2009 (UTC)

I also caught &amp;mdash; at the last moment &amp;mdash; one use of the word &quot;voting&quot; that we'd both missed up till then (though I also actually put one in, in the context of stating plainly that the declarations of position are not a vote).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:03, 18 November 2009 (UTC)
: I object to reverting to any earlier revision. I believe that most changes were discussed somewhere before they were made or were small minor changes as mentioned elsewhere on this talk page. I believe even the changes made now while I didn't agree with the wording exactly still reflect the general intended spirit of the policy. I have gone ahead and reworded it some more in an attempt to be more general towards what we actually do. '''Delete''' and '''Keep''' are hardly the only positions a person can take when discussing a work for example. People can also suggest merging, moving to a different wiki, etc. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:16, 18 November 2009 (UTC)
:: Since no one seems to be extremely hostile to the actual text, I have no problem in letting it stay where it is, but nevertheless it has to be validated by the normal procedural steps to be constituted as a community policy, as such there are several issues that have to be addressed.
::# Establish a static version for the evolution of this procedure. (There is still some minor improvements that are needed to be done before that, especially on the part referencing Transwiki and a more accurate description of the RFD proceedings and the possible outcomes as practiced now).

==  Proposal for alterations ==
On the Speedy deletions section, on point 1, ''&quot;...or any page in which you are the only contributor.&quot;'' if IIRC this was already present on the previous versions in a separated line, in any case this shouldn't be possible, any contribution to Wikibooks constitutes a licensing for the use of that content as such the contributor shouldn't be allowed to request a pull down even if he has clear ownership of it, this is important if the content in question is useful (the no meaningful content is covered on a different line).&lt;br&gt;
Clearly blocking those action isn't also useful, since it could promote attempts for circumvention, the best option is not to have it mentioned at all, any such issue should be addressed by the normal copyright policy or RFD (where a dialog would be possible).&lt;br&gt;
Since it is clear that that was not the intention of the text. Something similar in its intention but also badly worded on the Speedy deletion section, on point 5, ''&quot;A page that has been nominated for deletion due to a general reorganization by the contributors. In this situation, please include a link to the relevant discussion that occurred regarding the cleanup.&quot;'' this would also permit content loss, a wording requiring that all useful content was preserved is needed, as promoting the request of history merges.&lt;br&gt;
I call the situations similar, in that there will not be an active party defending the community interests (the preservation of content), making it so that no opposition would be expected by those acting toward the speedy deletions (even with the best intentions).&lt;br&gt;
In both situation the best option is to remove them as speedy deletions reasons, valid variations are already covered and more complex situations would be addressed by other existing processes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:24, 30 November 2009 (UTC)

== One week ==

Due to the size of the Wikibooks community, the following sentences should be altered:

:One week after the last comment if participants have mostly reached consensus about what to do, action will be taken by an administrator. Otherwise discussion may continue until consensus is reached. 

To, perhaps, something like:

:&lt;s&gt;Discussions may not be closed until consensus is reached or one month has elapsed.&lt;/s&gt;

How's that? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Kayau|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) 14:44, 2 October 2010 (UTC)

: I'm not sure you intended to propose what your wording would do.  By my reading, it would eliminate the one-week constraint entirely, and place a one-month lower limit on something else that is now unconstrained.  The two different issues are:
:* How long does an admin wait before declaring a consensus, and taking action?
:* How long does an admin wait before declaring a '''non'''-consensus, and closing without action?
: Taking these one at a time,
:* The existing wording says that consensus has to be stable for a week.  The proposed wording would remove that, but I'm not sure you intended to.  Perhaps you intended to propose '''increasing''' it?
:* The existing wording places no hard limits on how long a non-consensus will remain open; it's up to the judgment of admins.  Presumably that's because closing as no-consensus does no harm, and leaving open does no harm either.  My inclination is toward leaving admins with flexibility in a no-harm situation.
: --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:46, 2 October 2010 (UTC)

::Note that anyone can close the discussions (even if some outcomes can only be implemented by admins).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:20, 2 October 2010 (UTC) 

:I don't see a need for a change, in the event that the time-frame was problematic we would have seen an increase on undeletion requests. I also like that there is not imposition of a hard limit. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:20, 2 October 2010 (UTC)

::I do not understand why there has to be an increase on undeletion requests. I am only concerned that admins are no longer able to close discussions within 1 week even if consensus is reached. I'm sure most Wikibookians have noticed by now that the RfDs (as well as most other reading rooms) are much less active than before - perhaps even less active than Adrignola's talk page.

::I have read Pi zero's comments and decided to re-word the sentence I proposed. Yes, I do plan to get rid of the one-week thing, not lengthen it, to provide room for speedy/snowball keep/delete Feel free to alter it as I know it isn't perfect.

:::Discussions may not be closed until consensus is reached or a significant period of time has elapsed without any progress in discussion, in which case an admin will close the discussion as no consensus and the page shall be kept.

:::Anyone can close discussions. In any case we would certainly find people that would be willing to take on that administrative task if it becomes an issue.
:::If it isn't broken it doesn't need fixing and your proposed change would not bring any improvement over the common practice. RfD aren't exactly a priority from most Wikibookians this is clearly seen by the historical lack of participation on the discussions, even by the people that create the works under RfD, but it is one of the easiest areas to be noticed in the project by the active minority, we should also note that there is a finite number of pages that can be deleted and we recently had a some months of above normal activity on the RfDs and the new methods and practices have reduced for some time the chance of creating works that could be targeted by a RfD.
:::I also note that your new wording changes the default to a keep (in case of no participation). Most (but not all) RfDs are a proposal for deletion with a supporting justification for it, in the cases of solitary proposals (not seconded) would automatically result in a block to the proposal.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:20, 3 October 2010 (UTC)
::::Non-admins can only close discussions as speedy keep or, if an admin has deleted already, speedy delete.

:::::Darklama already covered the issue but so to be clear and respond to your question &quot;One week after the last comment...&quot; leaves ample room to any opposition to materialize, it is not &quot;despite common practice&quot; as you state but it is the common practice (and policy).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:19, 4 October 2010 (UTC)

Everything about the deletion process seems to be working fine to me. Don't fix what isn't broken. I believe '''1 week''' is seen as a ''soft limit'' in any case. Deciding what to do and acting on decisions shouldn't be confused for one another. Everyone is expected to follow the basic principals outlined by the [[WB:DM|decision making]] guideline when judging what the consensus is. Anyone, including people without tools, can close deletion discusses as non-speedy keep and delete too. Common practice may be for the person that intends to carry out the clean up to close discussion, but that is not required nor should it be. Being involved in the process of making a call on what the consensus is is one of many ways people can be involved in the community and possible demonstrate whether they would make good use of the tools or not if they had the tools. Making a call on what the consensus is is no big deal and if people believe the call doesn't accurately reflect what the consensus is, discussion will continue, the decision will be ignored, or the decision will be reversed. However using the tools to delete pages is considered a big deal (a high impact decision), which administrators are expected to do there best to get right and only do when appropriate. Assuring consensus is a part of that, but is not exclusive to administrators. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:30, 4 October 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that the deletion process isn't broken.  But that's all I agree with in the above paragraph.  Someone closing a non-speedy discussion without the tools to act on the decision or the explicitly defined community trust to do so is disruptive in my opinion and the idea that it's permissible is news to me. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:46, 4 October 2010 (UTC)
::The short answer is [[WB:FAITH|assume good faith]] explicitly requires us to trust all members of the community, [[WB:ADMIN|Administrators]] are not given any extra authority, and giving people the administrative tools is suppose to be no big deal. We must assume in good faith that anyone that closes a deletion discussion has done so in good faith with good intentions, unless specific reasons to doubt a person's intentions can be given or unless specific reasons to reverse a person's decision to close are given. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:04, 4 October 2010 (UTC)

::: I am also of the opinion the deletion process isn't broken.  Actually I quite the fan of the one week rule. I know there was at least one non-speedy RfD that got handled in a speedy way that I objected to (rather heatedly unfortunately).  I personally think that any non-reversible action (including history merges) shouldn't be taken until after the one week after the last comment is up.  But I don't think that needs to be spelled out in policy.   I am in favor of keeping the Deletion policy as is.

== Question about Speedy Deletion reason 6 for &quot;orphaned&quot; redirects ==

E.g. [[Cookbook:Pumpkin_pie]], why is this not a valid redirect?  I am relatively new to the project and recently created [[Cookbook:Custard pie]] as a redirect.  Redirects are cheap and it seems that it would be better for people to hit a valid redirect than a deleted page.  The reason I created the redirect is that a Wikipedia article [[w:Custard pie]] linked there.  Because it did so, via a standard template, it is likely that hundreds of Wikipedia articles link to such pages ([[w:Pumpkin pie]] does) (and to non-existent pages).  I've raised the issue on the relevant wikipedia template talk page but at the same time, I don't see why such redirects are considered &quot;orphaned or broken&quot; (one can only know if it's locally orphaned, not globally orphaned, without using toolserver tools) or why &quot;orphaned&quot; would be a valid reason for redirects to be deleted, that precludes any redirect that isn't used as a wikilink (and could preclude all redirects as all links could be 'fixed' to go around the redirect and link directly to the object).  Furthermore, a cross-case redirect seems logical, newcomers are unlikely to know minute rules like the fact that Cookbook namespace uses title case for all articles, especially if they've come here from Wikipedia, which prohibits such names (not to suggest that Wikibooks should follow those rules but it should 'care' about what referers sister projects may be using).  I've only been here a couple days and searching even for the rules on this caused me to run into several other deleted redirects (because I was looking where I thought made sense, which usually indicates a redirect is called for), e.g. [[Help:Redirect]] (which is even more puzzling to me than Pumpkin Pie).  Please explain.--[[User:Doug|Doug]] ([[User talk:Doug|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Doug|contribs]]) 21:09, 28 December 2013 (UTC)
:Books are self contained and intended to be capable of standing alone. Links from outside a book into the sub structure of the book are discouraged because they make the navigation confusing. While it may be obvious how links (and redirects are just a special kind of link) work to a Wikipedia user, this isn't Wikipedia and follows a different design for a different readership. To someone used to using books, or textbooks specifically, links that jump into the middle of another book, or out of the book, are confusing. When reading a book on physics you wouldn't expect to suddenly find yourself in a book on computer programming on sub page 6 in chapter 9 reading a paragraph on what a program is because you happened to click on a link &quot;program.&quot; Instead you'd expect at the most to be taken to a glossary within the book you were reading that explained &quot;program&quot; within the context of the book you were reading. The problem that redirects create is that it causes inappropriate linking. Let's say there is a redirect from &quot;Program&quot; to &quot;Computer Programming/Definitions/Beginners#Program&quot; - this means every link that was a red link in every book to &quot;Program&quot; will now link out of the book. It also isn't clear this should be the redirect - unlike Wikipedia there are hundreds or thousands of places &quot;Program&quot; could be linked to. But because this isn't an encyclopedia and is structured as books not articles, the DAB pages used in Wikipedia are inappropriate here and won't solve the problem. I've heard this explained before as think about Wikipedia as a single book. So Wikibooks is actually 2,695 individual Wikipedias each of which needs to have unique redirects and links. The only way to do this today is with separate namespaces for each book - which isn't going to happen. The alternative is to try and make the books self contained by not having cross book links - and redirects are just a special form of cross book link. As for the Cookbook - it is the same problem, albeit slightly easier because the Cookbook is in its own namespace. The same issue is there though. Who says &quot;Raspberry Pie&quot; should go to a recipe or a book on programming the Raspberry Pie or a sub page of the computer programming book, or the book on firmware engineering page? Without a massive DAB structure it'll quickly become a huge navigational mess.

== Move for change ==
'''In the Copyright section:'''&lt;br&gt;
The user who submitted the work has one week from this date to prove that they had permission to post the work, otherwise it will be deleted.&lt;br&gt;
'''should be reformed into:'''&lt;br&gt;
Violations can be resolved for instance by obtaining express permission from the copyright owner (see [[Wikibooks:Boilerplate request for permission]]), those should be registered at the [[Commons:OTRS|Wikimedia's OTRS]] if possible. While resolution is open to anyone, the user who submitted the content must defend his contribution as a registered Wikibookian with a valid email.&lt;br&gt;

The user who submitted the work has one week from this date to prove that they had permission to post the work, otherwise it will be deleted.&lt;br&gt;

After 7 days from the notice date if unresolved the violation will be deleted.&lt;br&gt;
'''Rational for the change:'''
The information is not available in the Copyright policy and it expressly addresses surviving a copyvio notification.&lt;br&gt; Since unregistred user's identity is harder to verify it seems reasonable to require a higher standard as to contest evidential proof of a possible copyright violation and so ease the identification of the one responsible for the added content (and crosschecking the rights). This of course does not exclude the need of a RfD in cases that the danger of using suspect material supplants the benefits to the project.&lt;br&gt;
Note that the Copyright policy deals exclusively with clear violations or pull down request not the suspicion of problematic content.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:23, 6 October 2014 (UTC)</text>

* Ácido Glicólico
É derivado da cana e açúcar e cientificamente chamado de AHA (alfa-hidroxi-ácido). O dermatologista Marcelo Bellini explica que esse ativo melhora a circulação da região em que for aplicado, facilitando a penetração dos nutrientes na pele e a renovação celular. A técnica esteticista e docente do Senac-SP, Janete C. Romano, acrescenta que o ácido glicólico também tem ação esfoliante, o que ajuda a melhorar a textura da pele e atenuar as linhas finas que aparecem com o passar dos anos. Quando utilizado em baixas concentrações, o ácido glicólico pode ser utilizado diariamente, em casa, em forma de creme ou gel. Já em concentrações elevadas, deve ser aplicado em clínicas especializadas, pois existe o risco de causar manchas na pele, se mal administrado.


* Ácido Retinóico
O ácido retinóico é derivado da Vitamina A, e age na produção de colágeno, uma substância essencial para manter a elasticidade e firmeza da pele. Também é um ativo de ação esfoliante, mas exige um pouco mais de cuidado na manipulação, por isso o tratamento com ácido retinóico deve ser feito apenas por especialistas. Também é possível utilizar o ácido retinóico como componente de géis e cremes de utilização diária, mas neste caso a concentração deve ter no máximo 0,1% do ativo. O dermatologista Marcelo Bellini lembra que quem se submeter a um tratamento com ácido retinóico não deve jamais se expor ao sol, para evitar o aparecimento de manchas.


* Vitamina C
A Vitamina C, na forma ativa de ácido L-ascórbico, ajuda na hidratação e na produção de substâncias que agem para renovar a pele. Ela tem um poder antioxidante, ou seja, estimula a eliminação de radicais livres da pele, que são pequenas moléculas que causam danos às células acelerando o processo de envelhecimento. A vitamina C também age na produção de colágeno, essencial para qualquer tipo de tratamento rejuvenescedor. É indicada, principalmente, para pessoas que apresentam linhas de expressão, rugas e alguns outros danos causados por alta exposição ao sol.


* DMAE
Quem partir em busca de produtos antienvelhecimento fatalmente vai se deparar com um tal de dimetilaminoetanol, popularmente conhecido como DMAE. Trata-se de uma substância retirada de alguns peixes, como o salmão e a sardinha, e é utilizada para aumentar a produção de colágeno e melhorar a aparência da pele.

O DMAE já deu muito que falar, mas ainda existem discussões e burburinhos a respeito da eficiência do produto, alguns dermatogistas adoram, outros desconfiam. O dermatologista Marcelo Bellini aposta na eficiência do DMAE, “os efeitos já foram apresentados pelo Congresso da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Estética”, argumenta. Mas, para a Dra. Ediléia, esses estudos ainda não são suficientes para comprovar a sua eficácia.

Um dos fatores da polêmica em torno do DMAE é o &quot;efeito Cinderela&quot; (ou “Coup d'eclat&quot;), algo parecido com mágica, que firma a pele instantaneamente. A dúvida é: será que o efeito é apenas momentâneo? Para o dermatologista Marcelo Bellini, a boa aparência pode ser conquistada com o uso contínuo do DMAE.

O dermatologista norte-americano Nicholas Perricone é um dos estudiosos que mais acreditam no poder rejuvenescedor do DMAE combinado com outros produtos. Sua extensa (e cara) linha de cosméticos é pouco conhecida no Brasil, mas já pode ser encontrada na nova loja Daslu.  

Perricone também é autor do livro “O Fim das Rugas” (Warner Books/Editora Campus) e conhecido como o médico das celebridades, por atender as maiores estrelas de Hollywood. Segundo o médico americano, o DMAE é indicado para cuidar de peles com perda de firmeza na região do rosto e do corpo, linhas de expressão que aparecem perto dos lábios, peles &quot;estressadas&quot; e até mesmo para dar mais definição aos lábios.

* Estrogênios
Os estrogênios, utilizados como ativos de cremes, são hormônios sexuais produzidos principalmente pelos ovários, agindo para regular o funcionamento dos órgãos reprodutores femininos. A técnica esteticista Janete C. Romano explica que a pele é um órgão muito reativo a hormônios sexuais, e por isso o estrogênio é utilizado em cosméticos. Sua principal função é aumentar as atividades dos fibroblastos, células responsáveis pela produção de colágeno.

* Neurocosméticos
Segundo o Dr. Marcelo Bellini, a saúde das células da pele depende do bom funcionamento das fibras nervosas da mesma, e é este o papel dos neurocosméticos, melhorar e estimular as fibras nervosas da pele por meio de géis e cremes. Os neurocosméticos ainda não são muito populares, pois ainda estão em estudos.</text>
