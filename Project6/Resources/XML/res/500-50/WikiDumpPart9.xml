      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Welcome to the main Planning page for the Chinese Wikibook.''' Unless your comment only pertains to a particular lesson, discuss your ideas here so that the overall planning discussion is not spread across many lesson pages. Initial planning and continued coordination of effort is extremely important to help reduce the need for reworking later. New issues are entered here, with the most recent at the bottom of the page. Please review the ''Table of Contents'' to see if your issue has already been raised; also check the archives (see below) in case it was discussed some time ago.

# Place your question '''at the bottom''' of the list;
# '''Title''' the question (by placing the title between equals signs like this: == ''title'' ==);
# '''Sign''' your name and date (by adding four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

== Chinese Wikibook Purpose and Audience ==
This book is intended to be a complete learning resource center for students of Mandarin Chinese. Dialects, such as Cantonese, will be covered by their own Wikibooks and be linked to in the See Also section of the Table of Contents (TOC). It should teach listening comprehension and speaking as well as reading and writing using whatever technologies are most appropriate (includes audio for text and animations for stroke orders).

The audience is the serious studier of Chinese, either at the high school or college level. Casual learners looking for a few choice phrases or unwilling to spend the time learning characters can be served adequately by the Chinese Phrasebook on Wikivoyage. Younger audiences can have age-appropriate material created for them in WikiJunior. Intermediate- or Advanced-Level modules may be added, but because of the cumulative nature of a language text (explained below), it would probably be best to focus efforts on the Introductory Level first and make continuations of the series later.

== The Need for Planning ==

Language Wikibooks faces some unique challenges from a planning perspective. It's harder to produce a quality, integrated work in language instruction than in other subjects, like Biology or Physics. Those you can break into discrete units and still read about it&amp;mdash;topics within the subject can be rearranged or meaningfully read even in isolation from the rest of the text.

Not so with an elementary language text. All the grammar and vocabulary that you learn is cumulative, so everything can only stack one way. Flipping ahead (or falling behind) more than a few chapters and you're lost. Order matters, so we use the a sequential naming scheme (Lesson 1, Lesson 2,...), not a topic-based one (Asking Questions, Giving Directions,...).

To avoid late-stage reorganizations that would neccessarily be painful with lots of work going to waste, we should agree on a 'Lesson Roadmap' beforehand and then flesh it out. I think a Wiki can really work for this, but that the project still needs a common format and approach. A standard outline for lessons would help a lot with that, so, may I suggest that the lessons of this text each include the components outlined below.

==Decided Conventions== &lt;!--more or less. should add references to relevant discussion areas--&gt;
#'''The Title Page leads to the main TOC''', not the Cover Page. The Cover Page can be linked from the TOC and used in Print versions.
#'''Hanyu Pinyin is used''' as the only Romanization format, though equivalency charts to other systems provided[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo]. Tone marks are used instead of tone numbers.
#'''Traditional or Simplified''' characters appear only in the Lesson Text and in parentheses in the Vocabulary sections&amp;mdash;not in titles, example sentences, or exercises.
#'''Traditional pages are linked as parallel subpages''' of every Simplified page. On every Traditional page, a parentdirectory link links back to the Simplified version, always providing a toggle button between versions.

==Unresolved Issues==

== Irregular Verbs ==

Irregular verbs do not fit in any particular conjugation.  Irregular verbs conjugate but not in a predictable manner. An example of an irregular verb that you have met is 'esse'.  There are a few others which will be listed in the present indicate active tense below for you to memorise and refer to.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Verb || Meaning || ego || tu || is/ea || nos || vos || ei/eae || Imperative sing. || Imp. pl
|-
| ire || to go || eo || is || it || imus || itis || eunt || i || ite
|-
| esse || to be || sum || es || est || sumus || estis || sunt || es || este
|-
| fieri || to become || fio || fis || fit || fimus || fitis || fiunt || fi || fite
|-
| velle || to wish || volo || vis || vult || volumus || vultis || volunt || (none) || (none)
|-
| malle || to prefer || malo || mavis || mavult || malumus || mavultis || malunt || (none) || (none)
|-
| nolle || to be unwilling || nolo || non vis || non vult || nolumus || non vultis || nolunt || noli* || nolite
|-
| ferre* || to carry || fero || fers || fert || ferimus || fertis || ferunt || fer || ferte
|-
| colspan=&quot;10&quot; | &lt;I&gt;The imperatives noli and nolite are used to mean &quot;don't&quot;, eg. &quot;nolite ire&quot; = &quot;don't go!&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;Sometimes ferre is considered to be an 'o' stem 3rd conjugation verb.  For practical purposes ferre is irregular.&lt;/I&gt;
|}

== Exercise 1 ==

1. Copy out this table and translate.

Translate the following sentences:

1. fero portam.
2. fers portam
3. fert portam
4. ferimus portam
5. fertis portam
6. ferunt portam
7. sum bonus
8. es bonus
9. est bonus
10. sumus bonī
11. estis bonī
12. sunt bonī
13. este bonī!
14. nolī currāre!

Answer the following questions:

15. What do the irregular verbs have in common with regular verbs?
16. Why do we use 'boni' in question 10, 11, and 12 but 'bonus' in question 7, 8 and 9?

== Exercise 2 ==

Exercises:

1. Decline the following five nouns in both singular and plural number in the five common cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative):


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;8&quot; | &lt;B&gt;Singular&lt;/B&gt;
|-
| Nominative || nauta || ātrium || servus || dictātor
| rēx || cornū || diēs
|-
| Accusative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Genitive || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Dative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Ablative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| colspan=&quot;8&quot; | &lt;B&gt;Plural&lt;/B&gt;
|-
| Nominative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Accusative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Genitive || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Dative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|-
| Ablative || ||  ||
 || 
|
 ||  ||
|}

2. Conjugate the verb 'servāre' in both singular and plural number and all three persons.

3. Conjugate the verb 'esse', in both singular and plural number and all three persons.

4. Translate:

Nota Bene: Often Latin uses the present to indicate a 'vivid past'. It would be suitable to translate the following passage in the past tense.

==Using a Dictionary==

To find a Latin word in the dictionary can be difficult.  Foremost, Latin verbs are listed using their the 'present indicative 1st person singular active' construct of the verb.  Thus, to find the meaning of the verb 'amāre', one must find 'amō' listed in the dictionary. Thus, one must use their wits to determine what the stem and what is the ending of the verb. A bit of searching around in the dictionary may be required.  There are a few verbs which are highly irregular which must be learnt such as 'ferō', I carry.

Nouns are usually much easier.  They are always given in the nominative singular case.   If you see a noun such as 'vōcem', and do not know what it is, do not fret.  If you look for 'vōc' in the dictionary, you will not find what you are looking for.  'em' is typically a third declension accusative ending, thus you should be aware that third declension nouns have radically changing stems.  Those which have the consonent 'c' usually have the consonent 'x' replacing it in the nominative singular. Thus the nominative singular of vōcem, is vōx.  Likewise, 'g' is also often used when shifting from nominative singular cases to other cases.  For example, rēx becomes 'rēgem' in the accusative. There are plenty of other simple rules which one learns through experience.

Unconjugatable and indeclinable words are listed 'as is'.

Translate the following passage:

Confessiōnum meārum librī tredecim et dē malīs et dē bonīs meīs deum laudant iūstum et bonum atque in eum excitant hūmānum intellectum et affectum. Interim quod ad mē attinet, hoc in mē egērunt cum scriberentur et agunt cum leguntur. Quid dē illīs aliī sentiant, ipsī viderint; multīs tamen frātribus eōs multum placuisse et placēre sciō.

There are three types of adjectives: Positive (the 'normal' adjective, eg. the &lt;B&gt;brave&lt;B&gt; man: &lt;B&gt;fortis&lt;B&gt; vir), Comparative (eg. the &lt;B&gt;braver&lt;B&gt; man, or the &lt;B&gt;rather brave&lt;B&gt; man: &lt;B&gt;fortior&lt;B&gt; vir) and Superlative (eg. the &lt;B&gt;bravest&lt;B&gt; man, or the &lt;B&gt;very brave&lt;B&gt; man: &lt;B&gt;fortissimus&lt;B&gt; vir). Comparatives and superlatives of adjectives are usually formed by appending the suffix -ior (genitive is -ioris) for comparatives and -issimus for superlatives.  All comparatives are declined like third declension nouns while superlatives are declined like second declension nouns, and thus must match the gender of the noun the superlative modifies. Often stem changes occur when appending theses suffixes.

|-

|}

===Irregular Adjectives===

Fortunately, there are only a few irregular adjectives.

&lt;br&gt;
'''Examples:'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''Latin'''
|'''English'''
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Marcus est fortior quam Publius
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | Marcus is stronger than Publius
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Publius ingeniosior est quam Marcus
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | Publius is more clever than Marcus
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Marcus plures denarios habet quam Publius
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | Marcus has more denariuses&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; than Publius
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | Publius plures sorores habet quam Marcus
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; | Publius has more sisters than Marcus
|-
|colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;small&gt;1: We won't say &quot;Marcus has more money&quot; (''pecunia'') since plus in the singular takes the genitive case, which will not be covered for a few more lessons&lt;/small&gt;
|}

==Adverbs==

Adverbs are formed usually by replacing the suffix appended to the stem with the -e, or -i and sometimes -um. Adverbs modify the verb in the clause that contains the adverb.  The adverb may be placed anywhere with the clause.  Adverbs may be of positive, comparative and superlative form. Unlike adjectives and substantives, adverbs do not have declension or gender. And thus they are referred to as being 'indeclinable.' Following suffices are appended to form the comparative and superlative forms of adverbs: -ius for comparatives and -issime for superlative.

===Example===

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | &lt;B&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;Adverbs&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
|-
| fortiter || fortius || fortissime
|-
| bravely || more bravely || most bravely
|}

Irregular adjectives form adverbs regularly from the adjective forms.

For example:

*melior (better) -&gt; melius
*maximus (greatest) -&gt; maxime

Some adverbs do not come from adjectives but rather exist on their own:

*diu (for a long time) -&gt; diutius, diutissime
*saepe (often) -&gt; saepius, saepissime

==Conjunctions==

Conjunctions are indeclinable particles that join clauses together to form sentences.  Examples of forms of conjunctions in English are: and, but and so. Conjunctions are either coordinating (joining two main clauses) or subordinating (joining a subclause to a main clause).

Based upon your reading of the table of conjunctions, how would one translate these sentences?

#Aut tu es bonus aut tu es malus ergo dīc mihi vēritātem (&lt;i&gt;tell me the truth&lt;/i&gt;).
#Cavēte canem quod nec estis fortes nec cum virtūte.
#Puer ē forō cum canē ambulat
#Et canis et cattus sunt laetī.
#In animō habeō īre ad grammaticum hodiē sed habeō labōrem (&lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;) domī.

==Prepositions==

You have met a few prepositions already.  Prepositions are indeclinable and genderless.  Prepositions are placed before substantives and adjectives.  Most prepositions take only the accusative or ablative case.  Some prepositions may take both, however their meanings differ depending on the case.

{{diet}}

Recently, interest has been picking up in '''low-calorie diets''', especially for their possible life-extending properties.

Studies with laboratory rats fed a nutritionally complete, yet calorie-restricted diet lived far longer than the control group which ate normal amounts. The lean rats also maintained youthful appearances and activity levels well into normal rat middle-age and had similar delays in age-related diseases.

A study of rhesus monkeys, genetically more similar to humans, is underway. Though not complete, so far the results  support the findings of the earlier rat study. Many people aren't waiting for the final results, but are starting their own restricted regimens.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Glossary of Grammatical Definitions=

==Ablative:==

The ablative case is an almost adverbial case which also takes many praepositiones. It is not surprising that many adjectives become adverbs by use of the ablative singular case.  The ablative case can denote precise position in time or space and thus takes praepositiones such as in and ab.  However in looser definitions of time and space, the accusative case is used. For example 'in tres dies', in three days time.  'circum agrum', around the field.

==Accusative:==

The noun which is in the accusative case is the object of a sentence. E.g. 'The boy runs home.' 'home' is considered to be in the accusative case because it is direct object of the transitive verb 'run'.  As well, certain praepositiones take the accusative case.&lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Direct Object&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Case&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

==Defective:==

Defective verbs are verbs which cannot be conjugated in all tenses, moods, numbers, and persons.

==Deponent:==

Deponent verbs are verbs which appear mainly in the passive case and have active meanings.  For example colloquor 'I talk'.

==Direct Object:==

The noun which is the direct object of a transitive verb. &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Case&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Accusative&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

==Genitive:== 
A noun in the genitive case is said to ecompass the sense of origin.  Thus the genitive usually can be equated to the possesive case in English, although it does occasionally take upon additional meanings.  E.g. 'The book of Daniel', 'of Daniel' is said to be in the genitive case. &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;case&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

==Impersonal Verbs:==

Impersonal Verbs are verbs which cannot take a subject, such as the verb 'to rain'.  One cannot say 'Daniel is raining', or 'The car is raining', both are grammatically incorrect.  The verb 'to rain' can only take the subject 'it', thus 'It's raining'. This can be said to be true with the Latin word for raining 'pluit'.

==Indirect Object:==

The indirect object is said to be equivelent to the dative case. &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Dative&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Case&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

==Locative:==
The locative case is an archaic case which remains in certain nouns (such as domus) meaning 'at'.  For example, 'domi' means 'at home'.

==Nominative:==
The noun which is in the nominative case is the subject of the sentence or verb.  E.g. The boy runs home. 'The boy' is the subject of the sentence and therefore is in the nominative case. &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Subject&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Case&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

==Noun (nomen):==

A noun is a part of speech which is divided into three branches: Substantivum, Adjectivum, and Pronomen.  A noun in the Latin language is defined as anything that can be thought of or conceived.  People, places, things, abstract concepts and qualities are thought to be nouns.  Most nouns are said to be declinable (nihil is an obvious exception). &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Case&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Declension&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Parts of Speech&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Sentence&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;&gt;

==Person:==

A finite verb is said to have person.  Person refers to the subject of the verb. A verb must conjugate to the corresponding form of the subject person. There are said to be three persons. First Person, referring to 'I or We', Second person, referring to 'Thou' or 'Ye', and third person referring to 'He, She, It, or They'.  A person can be said to be singular or plural in number.  Each Third persons are said to have gender.  The gender of the subject of a verb in the third person is determined by context if their is no noun in the nominative case present in the sentence, placing a demostrative pronomen in the nominative case in the desired gender as subject, or if a noun in the nominative case is present, by referring to the gender of the subject noun.

==Personal Verbs:==

Personal Verbs are verbs which can take a person or object as subject.

==Sentence:==

A group of words which has at least a verb and a subject and is in a grammatically correct order. &lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; The noun that is in the nominative case.  &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Nominative&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Case&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

==Tense:==

The time period an action took place.  Tense is determined by a suffix. Each tense is conjugated differently. There are said to be six tenses in total in the Latin language: Present Imperfect, Future Imperfect, Past Imperfect, Present Perfect, Future Perfect and Past Perfect.  These may also be referred to as respectively: Present, Future, Imperfect, Perfect, Future Perfect and Pluperfect.

==Voice:==

Verbs may be either passive or active in construct.  Subjects in active constructs of verbs typically perform the action, while in passive constructs suffer or are affected by the action. E.g. 'Daniel runs home.' has the verb 'run' in the active voice.  'Daniel was destroyed.' In this sentence Daniel is affected by the destruction, thus is in the passive tense. &lt;I&gt;See &lt;B&gt;Verb&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Deponent&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Languages ==
In most cases, the name of a language will be the name of the country where it is spoken with the suffix &quot;{{furi|語|ご}}&quot;. Example: &quot;France/French&quot; becomes &quot;フランス/フランス語&quot;. There are exceptions to these and they are so noted in the country names below.

English is spoken in several countries. These are all called {{furi|英語|えいご}} except in the case of the United States, the language of which is sometimes referred to as {{furi|米語|べいご}}.

== Nationalities ==
The nationality of a person from a particular country is generally that of the country appended with &quot;{{furi|人|じん}}. For example: A Chinese person is &quot;{{furi|中国|ちゅうごく}}{{furi|人|じん}} and a Canadian would be カナダ{{furi|人|じん}}.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Tommyde. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Tommyde~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|Basic foodstuffs]] | [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|Sweeteners]]

'''Maple syrup''' is a sweet condiment made from the sap of maple trees, common in [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North American cuisines]]. It is most often eaten with [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], [[Cookbook:Breakfast Waffles|waffles]], or [[Cookbook:French Toast|french toast]].
Maple syrup is also commonly used on hot [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] cereals including [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]], cream of wheat, and [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]].
Sometimes maple syrup is used as an ingredient in [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] or in preparing [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]]s.

Most &quot;maple-flavored&quot; syrups on the market today in the United States are imitation maple syrups, usually with little (''for advertising purposes'') or no real maple content.  They are usually thickened far beyond the viscosity of real maple syrup, as well. Real maple syrup is universally considered superior, although it is more expensive.

== Production ==
Real maple syrup comes from Canada or northern United States, especially New England (states in the northeast corner of the US) and New York. Most maple trees can be used as a source of sap, but the sugar maple (''Acer saccharum'') and black maple (''A. nigrum'') are the most favored, with professionals preferring the black over the sugar.  A maple syrup production farm is called a ''sugarbush'' or a ''sugarwoods''. Sap is boiled in a &quot;sugar shanty&quot;, &quot;sugar shack&quot;, or &quot;sugarhouse,&quot; which has only has partial side walls, being louvered at the top to vent moisture-laden air.

The province of Quebec in Canada is by far the world's largest producer of maple syrup, producing  15,600,000 [[Cookbook:L|litres]] in 2001 - about four times as much as all U.S. production combined. 

In Quebec, the process has become part of the culture, and city people often go to ''cabanes &amp;agrave; sucre'' in early spring, where lavish meals are served with maple syrup accompaniments. ''Tire sur la neige'' is a seasonal treat of thick hot syrup poured onto fresh [[Cookbook:Snow|snow]] then eaten off sticks as it quickly cools. Owing to its economic importance, the maple tree is an emblem of Canada, and its leaf is depicted on its flag.

As for American production, in 2001, Vermont produced 1,040,000 [[Cookbook:L|liters]] of real maple syrup, about a quarter of the U.S. production. Maine and New York state, with about 19 percent each, were next in line.

[[Image:Maple syrup taps.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sap collection]]

Production is concentrated in February.  It takes approximately forty parts sap to make one part maple syrup. A very small amount of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (usually with a pat of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]) is added during the reduction process to reduce the tendency of the boiling sap to froth up.

The earliest runs are the best quality. The best &quot;sugaring&quot; weather is clear, with days above freezing and nights below freezing, also with snow on the ground. Syrup made late in the season, when there are no longer nightime freezes, is dark, and the flavor is said to be ''buddy'', which decreases its value. The whole process must be done as quickly as possible. Too much time in storage can induce fermentation in the sap, and too much time boiling can also reduce quality. Usually the whole process from any batch of sap finishes in syrup within just a few hours.

Maple syrup is sometimes boiled down further to make [[Cookbook:Maple Sugar|maple sugar]], usually sold in pressed blocks, and translucent candy.

These are some of the many real-world examples that require the use of statistics. How would you approach the problem statements? There are some stepwise human algorithms, but is there a general problem statement?

*&quot;Find possible solutions, decide on a solution, plan the solution, implement the solution, learn from the results for future solutions (or re-solution).&quot;
*&quot;SOAP - subjective - the problem as given, objective - the problem after examination, assessment - the better defined problem, plan - decide if guidelines to management already exist, and blueprint the solution for this case, or generate a risk-minimizing, new solution path&quot;. 
*&quot;HAMRC - hypothesis, aim,  methodology, results, conclusion&quot; - the concept that there is no real difference is the null hypothesis.

Then there is the joke that compares the different ways of thinking:

&quot;A physicist, a chemist and a statistician were working collaboratively on a problem, when the wastepaper basket spontaneously combusted (they all swore they had stopped smoking). The chemist said, 'quick, we must reduce the concentration of the reactant which is oxygen, by increasing the relative concentration of non-reactive gases, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Place a fire blanket over the flames.'  The physicist, interjected, 'no, no, we must reduce the heat energy available for activating combustion ; get some water to douse the flame'. Meanwhile, the statistician was running around lighting more fires. The others asked with alarm, 'what are you doing?'. 'Trying to get an adequate sample size'.&quot;

==General Definition==

Statistics, in short, is the study of data. It includes '''descriptive statistics''' (the study of methods and tools for collecting data, and mathematical models to describe and interpret data) and '''inferential statistics''' (the systems and techniques for making probability-based decisions and accurate predictions.

==Etymology==

As its name implies, statistics has its roots in the idea of &quot;the state of things&quot;. The word itself comes from the ancient Latin term ''statisticum collegium'', meaning &quot;a lecture on the state of affairs&quot;. Eventually, this evolved into the Italian word ''statista'', meaning &quot;statesman&quot;, and the German word ''Statistik'', meaning &quot;collection of data involving the State&quot;. Gradually, the term came to be used to describe the collection of any sort of data.

==Statistics as a subset of mathematics==

As one would expect, statistics is largely grounded in mathematics, and the study of statistics has lent itself to many major concepts in mathematics: probability, distributions, samples and populations, the bell curve, estimation, and data analysis.

==Up ahead==

Up ahead, we will learn about subjects in modern statistics and some practical applications of statistics. We will also lay out some of the background mathematical concepts required to begin studying statistics.

Imagine reading a book for the first few chapters and then becoming able to get a sense of what the ending will be like - this is one of the great reasons to learn statistics. With the appropriate tools and solid grounding in statistics, one can use a limited sample (e.g. read the first five chapters of Pride &amp; Prejudice) to make intelligent and accurate statements about the population (e.g. predict the ending of Pride &amp; Prejudice). This is what knowing statistics and statistical tools can do for you.

In today's information-overloaded age, statistics is one of the most useful subjects anyone can learn. Newspapers are filled with statistical data, and anyone who is ignorant of statistics is at risk of being seriously misled about important real-life decisions such as what to eat, who is leading the polls, how dangerous smoking is, etc. Knowing a little about statistics will help one to make more informed decisions about these and other important questions. Furthermore, statistics are often used by politicians, advertisers, and others to twist the truth for their own gain. For example, a company selling the cat food brand &quot;Cato&quot; (a fictitious name here), may claim quite truthfully in their advertisements that eight out of ten cat owners said that their cats preferred Cato brand cat food to &quot;the other leading brand&quot; cat food. What they may not mention is that the cat owners questioned were those they found in a supermarket buying Cato.

“The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone else’s backyard.”
[[wikipedia:John W. Tukey | John Tukey, Princeton University]]

More seriously, those proceeding to higher education will learn that statistics is the most powerful tool available for assessing the significance of experimental data, and for drawing the right conclusions from the vast amounts of data faced by engineers, scientists, sociologists, and other professionals in most spheres of learning. There is no study with scientific, clinical, social, health, environmental or political goals that does not rely on statistical methodologies. The basic reason for that is that variation is ubiquitous in nature and [[probability]] and [[statistics]] are the fields that allow us to study, understand, model, embrace and interpret variation.

'''Corn syrup''' is a syrup made from [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]. It is naturally composed mainly of glucose, but usually modified by enzymes to contain between 42% and 90% fructose. When used as a sweetener, corn syrup has a taste that makes it inferior to [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. Corn syrup can also affect some people who are highly allergic to corn. Corn syrup can be less expensive than sugar though, primarily due to taxes and subsidies. Many commercial products made in the USA are reformulated to use corn syrup as production increases.

Corn syrup can be useful in home cooking as well. It is less likely to crystalize than plain [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], leading to usage in frosting and fudge. It is a liquid and thus does not need to be dissolved.

[[Cookbook:Cane Syrup|Cane syrup]], [[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]], and [[Cookbook:Light Treacle|light treacle]] are unfortunately not exact substitutes for corn syrup.

[[Image:Sugar Brown.jpg|right|thumb|Brown sugar]]

'''Brown sugar''' is a soft sugar whose crystals are covered by a film of refined [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]. Light brown sugar and dark brown sugar vary in their amounts of molasses - therefore, dark brown sugar has a deeper molasses taste than light brown.

Brown sugar is produced similarly to white sugar, with two exceptions. The crystals are left much smaller than for white sugar, and the syrup or molasses is not washed off completely. Some brown sugar producers produce brown sugar by adding molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals in order to more carefully control the ratio of molasses to sugar crystals. 

This is mainly done for inventory control and convenience; there may also be tax-related reasons to use sugar from sugar beets with molasses from sugar cane. The resulting brown sugar is not any different, whichever way it is prepared.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Learn ==
The &quot;Open Content Photography Program&quot; was created to help people learn professional photography. It is not a book about photography it is a book about learning photography. Open Content means anyone can, not just read it, but also improve it.

I think the term professional photography is misused here.  Professional photographers are those who make their living from photography.  Very few people with little or no prior knowledge will make it as a 'pro' without formal training and work experience in a field as competitive as photography.  Maybe the word professional should be dropped and replaced with 'professional techniques of photography'.

== Help others help you to learn ==
If you improve the study program with your correct articles, useful links and information; more people will use it and they will improve the program too. You learn and teach in exchange, everybody wins.

== Free ==
The Open Content Photography Program is free, and it will always be free.

== Always evolving ==
As long as people use this book, and contribute by adding or changing content it will improve. Even if their founders stop helping, others will continue their task.

== Disciplines ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The light ==

In photography, light is in fact the single most important aspect of consideration.

What time of day in which you choose to shoot can affect both how the subject will be represented, as well as your technical limitations in presenting it. When photographing it is wise to make use of the 'slowest' or smallest ISO film/medium possible... This reduces 'noise' in the case of digital, and grain in the case of film. Of course, there are exceptions to this, when the surreal/aged feel grain or noise adds to a photo is desirable, however for the most part, the high picture quality granted by slower sensitivities is preferable.

What separates a professional looking photograph from an amateur snapshot is both the quality of the light, and the quality of consideration placed on 'how I will deal with this type of light'.

For instance, if one was photographing a scene in which motion would be better represented slowly, a sudden need for more light arises. More so if coupled with that is a need for great depth of field. If at all possible, a photographer must make considerations such as; time of day (when will the light be strongest) and weather (does the skycast offer greater or lesser contrast in the photograph).

Most of these requirements are greatly reduced in difficulty when shooting in a studio, as the light is directly controlable, but a new difficulty arises... One must aspire to create a light that simulates light that humans have over eons come accustomed to seeing... One must simulate 'nice' light.... One must aspire to simulate the ways in which the sunlight shines on the subject.

== Direction ==
The direction of the light is a critical consideration;

For instance, in portraiture, one would rarely use a ligh source that casts shadows upwards onto a face... That is to say, one would generally avoid placing the light below the subject, otherwise fall victime to 'scary campfire light' as is created by underlight flashlights to scare children... this light is both un-flattering, and un-natural.

Instead, to create a quality photograph, photographers try to emulate the suns' representation of light... That is, a light that falls both on the subject (from above) and on surroundings, and then reflects back onto the subject. This reflecting property of light is key. By placing a reflective surface opposite the shadows on a subject, one can fill the darker areas with a 'soft' or diffused type of light. The difference from such a subtle chance can be astounding.

== Contrast ==
Contrast is the measure of the difference between the shadow and highlight brightness in a photograph.

Low: A low contrast photograph, having a lower contrast grade will look more greyish in the case of black and white, and will be subject to a muted feel in color.

Hard: A hard contrast image will have both very bright highlights and dark shadows, and the lines which define the shadowed areas will be much more significant and remarkable.

A between might be considered when shooting... A contrast grade that neither enhances or reduces dramatic effect in a photograph might be called 'normal' contrast or 'medium' with the advent of digital.

while contrast can be controlled in the darkroom/digital darkroom, it is wise to make considerations when shooting... What sort of contrast do you want to emphasize should relflect the nature of the light your shooting in.

== Color ==

RGB

Color temperature (Kelvin)


== Nature ==
Hard light; A light which casts heavy, clear, profound shadows when interrupted by an opaque object. Hard light gives high contrast and produces vivid and vibrant colors.It is generally used to increase drama in the picture.

Soft light; A light whose shadows are cast in a more soft, and subtle way. Softer diffused light can be created by increasing the size of the source with respect to the subject which can further be diffused by using filters (translucent materials) or by reflecting the light off an intermediary surface (generally walls-thereby further increasing the size of the source) before it falls on subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The digital darkroom, what you should know ==

Learn good digital darkroom practices. There are procedures to improve the image that can be done with a lot of different software.

Learn how to master a good image editing program. Make a lot of experiments and read the manual. You can also follow tutorials on the Internet or buy books about it.

Learn how to choose the equipment you buy. Choosing the more adequate digital darkroom equipment requires a lot of study.

== The computer ==

Two types of computers work in digital photography, the Macintosh and the Windows PC computers. The Mac has many advantages in this area, however the PC has many more programs available. There was a time when the Mac was the king, but as the Mac and Windows operating system have developed, and the advancements in hardware speed, the advantages that Mac once held has been greatly diminished.

If you can´t afford, or if you prefer, you can also use &quot;Linux&quot; Operating system instead of &quot;Microsoft Windows&quot; or &quot;MacOS&quot;. &quot;Mandrake Linux 10.1&quot; when used with KDE (default) has a very useful tool for calibrating your monitor. &quot;Gimp&quot; is widely considered as the best open source photo editing software. 

Usually &quot;Linux&quot; operating system and other &quot;Linux&quot; software are free.

For your venture into Digital Photography, your computer should have at least a 500 MHz processor, and 512 MB RAM. You should also have a large hard drive to  store your images. A disk burner is also a necessity to backup your image files.

== The scanner ==

If you start your photography with a digital camera probably you don't need a scanner.

If you need to scan negatives or slides with some quality, you'll need a dedicated scanner, one that just works with negatives and slides.

Print scanners are good for prints, not for transparencies. (Name given to negatives or slides)

== Computer software ==

[http://www.adobe.com/photoshop/ Photoshop] is the professional choice for anyone who needs a program for professional use. Its the most complete package for image processing and a standard in prepress world.

[http://www.gimp.org GIMP] is a very nice program, its free and can be downloaded in the web. It lacks features to be considered a program for professional press use. However its fine for anyone who wants to learn and print their own portfolio, or to build a web page.

[http://www.jasc.com/products/paintshoppro/ Paint Shop Pro] is also a very good alternative to Photoshop, and it costs much, much less.

[http://www.picasa.com/ Picasa] is a very good album organizer software. It's great to search, catalog and display photos.

[http://www.fototagger.com/ FotoTagger] is a free software tool for annotating digital images. You can place location-specific, easy-to-hide labels on a picture to identify persons, landmarks, put comments, etc. Stores annotations in the metadata section of a JPEG file.

== Printers ==
Printers can be used for printing one's photos.  However, a quality printer will be of need if wanting to print high resolution photos.  

Photo printers are the newest thing and are exclusively good for printing photos.  One can simply insert a photo card into the printer in order for the printer to bring up all the photos on the card and print off from that.

'''Syntax''' treats of the relation, agreement, government, and arrangement, of words in sentences.

The '''relation''' of words is their reference to other words, or their dependence according to the sense.

The '''agreement''' of words is their similarity in person, number, gender, case, mood, tense, or form.

The '''government''' of words is that power which one word has over another, to cause it to assume some particular modification.

The '''arrangement''' of words is their collocation, or relative position, in a sentence.

A '''sentence''' is an assemblage of words, making complete sense, and always containing a nominative and a verb: as,

*&quot;Reward sweetens labour.&quot;

The principal parts of a sentence are usually three; namely, the '''subject''', or '''nominative'''; the '''finite verb'''; and the '''object''' governed by the verb: as,

*&quot;Crimes deserve punishment.&quot;

A '''predicate''' is the part of the sentence (or clause) which states something about the subject.

The other or subordinate parts depend on these, either as primary or as secondary '''adjuncts''': as,

*&quot;High crimes justly deserve very severe punishments.&quot;

Sentences are usually said to be of two kinds, simple and compound.

A '''simple sentence''' is a sentence which consists of one single assertion, supposition, command, question, or exclamation: as,

*&quot;David and Jonathan loved each other.&quot;
*&quot;If your enemy hunger.&quot;
*&quot;Do violence to no man.&quot;
*&quot;Am I not an apostle?&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Cor., ix, 1.
*&quot;What immortal glory shall I have acquired!&quot;&amp;mdash;Hooke: Mur. Seq., p. 71.

A '''compound sentence''' is a sentence which consists of two or more simple ones either expressly or tacitly connected: as,

*&quot;Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; who shall tell you words, whereby you and all your house shall be saved.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, xi, 13.
*&quot;The more the works of Cowper are read, the more his readers will find reason to admire the variety and the extent, the graces and the energy, of his literary talents.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hayley: Mur. Seq., p. 250.

A '''clause''', or '''member''', is a subdivision of a compound sentence; and is itself a sentence, either simple or compound: as,

*&quot;If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.&quot;&amp;mdash;Prov., xxv, 21.

A '''phrase''' is two or more words which express some relation of different ideas, but no entire proposition: as,

*&quot;By the means appointed.&quot;
*&quot;To be plain with you.&quot;
*&quot;Having loved his own.&quot;

Words that are omitted by '''ellipsis''', and that are necessarily understood in order to complete the construction, must be supplied in '''parsing'''.

The leading principles to be observed in the construction of sentences, are embraced in the following rules, which are arranged, as nearly as possible, in the order of the '''parts of speech'''.


==Articles==

Articles relate to the nouns which they limit: as,

*&quot;At a little distance from the ruins of the abbey, stands an aged elm.&quot;
*&quot;See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing, the sot a hero, lunatic a king.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope's Essay, Ep. ii, l. 268.

===The comparative or superlative degree===

The definite article may relate to an adjective or adverb of the comparative or the superlative degree: as,

*&quot;A land which was the mightiest.&quot;&amp;mdash;Byron.
*&quot;The farther they proceeded, the greater appeared their alacrity.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.
*&quot;He chooses it the rather.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===An unstressed numeral===

The indefinite article is sometimes used to give a collective meaning to an unstressed numeral (a plural adjective of number): as,

*&quot;You have a few names even in Sardis.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rev., iii, 4.
*&quot;There are a thousand things which crowd into my memory.&quot;&amp;mdash;Spectator, No. 468.
*&quot;The centurion commanded a hundred men.&quot;&amp;mdash;Webster.

==Nouns==

===The subject or nominative===

A noun or a pronoun which is the subject of a finite verb, must be in the nominative case: as,

*&quot;The Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things; and they derided him.&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, xvi, 14.
*&quot;But where the meekness of self-knowledge veils the front of self-respect, there look you for the man whom none can know but they will honour.&quot;&amp;mdash;Book of Thoughts, p. 66.
*&quot;Do you mourn Philander's fate? I know you say it: says your life the same?&quot;&amp;mdash;Young, N. ii, l. 22.

The subject, or nominative, is generally placed before the verb: as,

*&quot;Peace dawned on his mind.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;What is written in the law?&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.

But, in the following nine cases, the subject of the verb is usually placed after it, or after the first auxiliary:

====A question====

When a question is asked without an interrogative pronoun in the nominative case: as,

*&quot;Shall mortals be implacable?&quot;&amp;mdash;Hooke.
*&quot;What are you doing?&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;How many loaves have you?&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;Are they Israelites? So am I.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.

====The imperative mood====

When the verb is in the imperative mood: as,

*&quot;Go you,&quot;
*&quot;Come you.&quot;

But, with this mood, the pronoun is very often omitted and understood: as,

*&quot;Philip said to him, Come and see.&quot;&amp;mdash;John, i, 46.
*&quot;And he said to them, Be not afraid.&quot;&amp;mdash;Mark, xvi, 5.

====An earnest wish or strong feeling====

When an earnest wish, or other strong feeling, is expressed: as,

*&quot;May she be happy!&quot;
*&quot;How were we struck!&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;Not as the world gives, give I to you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.

====A supposition without if====

When a supposition is made without the conjunction if: as,

*&quot;Had they known it;&quot; for, &quot;If they had known it.&quot;
*&quot;Were it true;&quot; for, &quot;If it were true.&quot;
*&quot;Could we draw by the covering of the grave;&quot; for, &quot;If we could draw,&quot; etc.

====Neither or nor====

When neither or nor, signifying and not, precedes the verb: as,

*&quot;This was his fear; nor was his apprehension groundless.&quot;
*&quot;You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gen., iii, 3.

====Emphasis====

When, for the sake of emphasis, some word or words are placed before the verb, which more naturally come after it: as,

*&quot;Here am I,&quot;
*&quot;Narrow is the way,&quot;
*&quot;Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have, give I you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.

====No regimen====

When the verb has no regimen, and is itself emphatical: as,

*&quot;Echo the mountains round.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.
*&quot;After the light infantry marched the grenadiers, then followed the horse.&quot;&amp;mdash;Buchanan's Syntax, p. 71.

====A dialogue====

When the verbs, say, answer, reply, and the like, introduce the parts of a dialogue: as,

*&quot;'Son of affliction,' said Omar, 'who are you?' 'My name,' replied the stranger, 'is Hassan.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

====The adverb there====

When the adverb ''there'' precedes the verb: as,

*&quot;There lived a man.&quot;&amp;mdash;Montgomery.
*&quot;In all worldly joys, there is a secret wound.&quot;&amp;mdash;Owen.

This use of ''there'', is idiomatic, and somewhat different from the use of the same word in reference to a particular
locality: as,

*&quot;Because there was not much water there.&quot;&amp;mdash;John, iii, 23.

===Apposition or appositive===

A noun or a personal pronoun used to explain a preceding noun or pronoun, is put, by '''apposition''', in the same case: as,

*&quot;But it is really I, your old friend and neighbour, Piso, late a dweller on the Coelian hill, who am now basking in the warm skies of Palmyra.&quot;&amp;mdash;Zenobia.
*&quot;But he, our gracious Master, kind as just, knowing our frame, remembers we are dust.&quot;&amp;mdash;Barbauld.

An apposition or '''appositive''' is an interjection into a sentence. Appositive renames, or adds to the description of another noun. The thought expressed by the sentence will stand fully on its own without the appositive. In the following sentence, &quot;My best friend's collie&quot; is an appositive:

*&quot;The dog, my best friend's collie, caught the frisbee every time.&quot;

===A possessive noun===

A noun or a pronoun in the possessive case, is governed by the name of the thing possessed: as,

*&quot;God's mercy prolongs man's life.&quot;&amp;mdash;Allen.
*&quot;Theirs is the vanity, the learning yours; touched by your hand, again Rome's glories shine.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

The possessive case generally comes immediately before the governing noun, expressed or understood: as,

*&quot;All nature's difference keeps all nature's peace.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.
*&quot;Lady! be yours (i. e., your walk) the Christian's walk.&quot;&amp;mdash;Chr. Observer.
*&quot;Some of Aeschylus's [plays] and Euripides's plays are opened in this manner.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 459.

And in this order one possessive sometimes governs another: as,

*&quot;Peter's wife's mother,&quot;
*&quot;Paul's sister's son.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.

But, to this general principle of arrangement, there are some exceptions: as,

====An adjective====

When the governing noun has an adjective, this may intervene: as,

*&quot;Flora's earliest smells.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.
*&quot;Of man's first disobedience.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.

In the following phrase from the Spectator,

*&quot;Of Will's last night's lecture,&quot;

it is not very clear, whether Will's is governed by night's or by lecture; yet it violates a general principle of our grammar, to suppose the latter; because, on this supposition, two possessives, each having the sign, will be governed by
one noun.

====The affirmed or denied possessive====

When the possessive is affirmed or denied: as,

*&quot;The book is mine, and not John's.&quot;

But here the governing noun may be supplied in its proper place; else a pronoun or the verb will be the only
governing word: as,

*&quot;You are Christ's [disciples, or people]; and Christ is God's [son].&quot;&amp;mdash;St. Paul.

Whether this phraseology is thus elliptical or not, is questionable.

====The case without the sign====

When the case occurs without the sign, either by apposition or by connection: as,

*&quot;In her brother Absalom's house.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;David and Jonathan's friendship.&quot;&amp;mdash;Allen.
*&quot;Adam and Eve's morning hymn.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Ash.
*&quot;Behold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, is the Lord's your God.&quot;&amp;mdash;Deut., x, 14.
*&quot;For peace and quiet's sake.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.
*&quot;To the beginning of King James the First's reign.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bolingbroke, on Hist., p. 32.

===The object of predicate===

A noun or a pronoun made the object of an active '''transitive''' verb or participle, is governed by it in the objective case: as,

*&quot;I found her assisting him,&quot;
*&quot;Having finished the work, I submit it,&quot;
*&quot;Preventing fame, misfortune lends him wings, and Pompey's self his own sad story brings.&quot; &amp;mdash;Rowe's Lucan, B. viii, l. 66.

===An intransitive verb===

A noun or a pronoun put after an '''intransitive''' verb or participle, agrees in case with a preceding noun or pronoun referring to the same thing: as,

*&quot;It is I,&quot;
*&quot;These are they,&quot;
*&quot;The child was named John,&quot;
*&quot;It could not be he,&quot;
*&quot;The Lord sits King forever.&quot;&amp;mdash;Psalms, xxix, 10.
*&quot;What war could ravish, commerce could bestow, and he returned a friend, who came a foe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Ep. iii, l. 206.

===An absolute noun===

A noun or a pronoun is put '''absolute''' in the nominative, when its case depends on no other word: as,

*&quot;He failing, who shall meet success?&quot;
*&quot;Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?&quot;&amp;mdash;Zech., i, 5.
*&quot;Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Cor., ix, 6.
*&quot;Nay but, O man, who are you that replies against God?&quot;&amp;mdash;Rom., ix, 20.
*&quot;O rare we!&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.
*&quot;Miserable they!&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.

==Adjectives==

===An adjective relates to nouns===

Adjectives relate to nouns or pronouns: as,

*&quot;Miserable comforters are you all.&quot;&amp;mdash;Job, xvi, 2.
*&quot;No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high desires and powers of an immortal spirit.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair.
*&quot;Whatever faction's partial notions are, no hand is wholly innocent in war.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rowe's Lucan, B. vii, l. 191.

====An intervening verb====

An adjective sometimes relates to a phrase or sentence which is made the subject of an intervening verb: as,

*&quot;To insult the afflicted, is impious.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn.
*&quot;That he should refuse, is not strange.&quot;
*&quot;To err is human.&quot;

====Combined arithmetical numbers====

In combined arithmetical numbers, one adjective often relates to another, and the whole phrase, to a subsequent noun: as,

*&quot;One thousand four hundred and fifty-six men,&quot;
*&quot;Six dollars and eighty-seven and a half cents for every five days' service,&quot;
*&quot;In the one hundred and twenty-second year,&quot;
*&quot;One seven times more than it was wont to be heated.&quot;&amp;mdash;Daniel, iii, 19.

====A being or action in the abstract====

With an infinitive or a participle denoting being or action in the abstract, an adjective is sometimes also taken abstractly; that is, without reference to any particular noun, pronoun, or other subject: as,

*&quot;To be sincere, is to be wise, innocent, and safe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hawkesworth.
*&quot;Capacity marks the abstract quality of being able to receive or hold.&quot;&amp;mdash;Crabb's Synonymes.
*&quot;Indeed, the main secret of being sublime, is to say great things in few and plain words.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hiley's Gram., p. 215.
*&quot;Concerning being free from sin in heaven, there is no question.&quot;&amp;mdash;Barclay's Works, iii, 437.
*Better, &quot;Concerning freedom from sin,&quot; etc.

====Abstract nouns====

Adjectives are sometimes substituted for their corresponding abstract nouns; perhaps, in most instances, elliptically: as,

*&quot;The sensations of sublime and beautiful are not always distinguished by very distant boundaries.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 47.
*&quot;The faults opposite to the sublime are chiefly two: the frigid, and the bombast.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p. 44.
*Better, &quot;The faults opposite to sublimity, are chiefly two; frigidity and bombast.&quot;
*&quot;Yet the ruling character of the nation was that of barbarous and cruel.&quot;&amp;mdash;Brown's Estimate, ii, 26.
*&quot;In a word, agreeable and disagreeable are qualities of the objects we perceive.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames, El. of Crit., i, 99.
*&quot;Polished, or refined, was the idea which the author had in view.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 219.

===An adjective placed before noun===

The adjective is generally placed immediately before its noun: as,

*&quot;Vain man! is grandeur given to gay attire?&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.

Adjectives can also come before the subject:

*&quot;The red dog likes chocolate.&quot;
*&quot;The tiny man had a height problem.&quot;

In the following instances the adjective is placed after the word to which it relates:

====Pronouns====

Those adjectives which relate to pronouns, most commonly follow them: as,

*&quot;They left me weary on a grassy turf.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

But to both these general rules there are many exceptions; for the position of an adjective may be varied by a variety of circumstances, not excepting the mere convenience of emphasis: as,

*&quot;And Jehu said, to which of all us?&quot;&amp;mdash;2 Kings, ix, 5.

====Words which depend on the adjective====

When other words depend on the adjective, or stand before it to qualify it: as,

*&quot;A mind conscious of right,&quot;
*&quot;A wall three feet thick,&quot;
*&quot;A body of troops fifty thousand strong.&quot;

====The quality which results from action====

When the quality results from an action, or receives its application through a verb or participle: as,

*&quot;Virtue renders life happy.&quot;
*&quot;He was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza.&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Kings, xvi, 9.
*&quot;All men agree to call vinegar sour, honey sweet, and aloes bitter.&quot;&amp;mdash;Burke, on Taste, p. 38.
*&quot;God made you perfect, not immutable.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

====The quality which excites admiration====

When the quality excites admiration, and the adjective would thus be more clearly distinctive: as,

*&quot;Goodness infinite,&quot;
*&quot;Wisdom unsearchable.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray.

====A verb====

When a verb comes between the adjective and the noun: as,

*&quot;Truth stands independent of all external things.&quot;&amp;mdash;Burgh.
*&quot;Honour is not seemly for a fool.&quot;&amp;mdash;Solomon.

====The adjective formed by prefix====

When the adjective is formed by means of the prefix a: as, afraid, alert, alike, alive, alone, asleep, awake, aware, averse, ashamed, askew. To these may be added a few other words: as, else, enough, extant, extinct, fraught, pursuant.

====The nature of a participle====

When the adjective has the nature, but not the form, of a participle: as,

*&quot;A queen regnant,&quot;
*&quot;The prince regent,&quot;
*&quot;The heir apparent,&quot;
*&quot;A lion, not rampant, but couchant or dormant,&quot;
*&quot;For the time then present.&quot;

====Poetry====

In some instances, the adjective may either precede or follow its noun; as, in poetry, provided the sense be obvious: as,

*&quot;Will you to the isles atlantic, to the rich hesperian clime, fly in the train of Autumn?&quot;&amp;mdash;Akenside, P. of I., Book i, p. 27.
*&quot;Will you fly with laughing Autumn to the atlantic isles, and range with him the hesperian field?&quot;&amp;mdash;Id. Bucke's Gram., p. 120.

====Technical usage====

When technical usage favours one order, and common usage another: as,

*&quot;A notary public,&quot; or, &quot;A public notary;&quot;
*&quot;The heir presumptive,&quot; or, &quot;The presumptive heir.&quot;

====An adverb====

When an adverb precedes the adjective: as,

*&quot;A Being infinitely wise,&quot; or,
*&quot;An infinitely wise Being.&quot;

Murray, Comly, and others, here approve only the former order; but the latter is certainly not ungrammatical.

====Belonging to the same noun====

When several adjectives belong to the same noun: as,

*&quot;The red, hungry dog ate the chocolate.&quot;
*&quot;The car is red, slow and very old.&quot;
*&quot;A woman, modest, sensible, and virtuous,&quot; or, &quot;A modest, sensible, and virtuous woman.&quot;

====An emphatic adjective====

When the adjective is emphatic, it may be foremost in the sentence, though the natural order of the words would bring it last: as,

*&quot;Weighty is the anger of the righteous.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;Blessed are the pure in heart.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.
*&quot;Great is the earth, high is the heaven, swift is the sun in his course.&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Esdras, iv, 34.
*&quot;The more laborious the life is, the less populous is the country.&quot;&amp;mdash;Goldsmith's Essays, p. 151.

====A part of the object or predicate====

When the adjective and its noun both follow a verb as parts of the predicate, either may possibly come before the other, yet the arrangement is fixed by the sense intended. Thus, there is a great difference between the following assertions:

*&quot;We call the boy good,&quot;
*&quot;We call the good boy.&quot;

====An equivalent to an adverb====

By an ellipsis of the noun, an adjective with a preposition before it, is sometimes equivalent to an adverb: as,

*&quot;In particular;&quot; that is, &quot;In a particular manner;&quot; equivalent to &quot;Particularly&quot;.
*So &quot;In general&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Generally&quot;.

==Pronoun antecedents==

A pronoun must agree with its '''antecedent''', or the noun or pronoun which it represents, in person, number, and gender: as,

*&quot;This is the friend of whom I spoke; he has just arrived.&quot;
*&quot;This is the book which I bought; it is an excellent work.&quot;
*&quot;You, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons to love it too.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.
*&quot;Speak you, whose thoughts at humble peace repine, shall Wolsey's wealth with Wolsey's end be yours?&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

===Something indefinite===

When a pronoun stands for some person or thing '''indefinite''', or unknown to the speaker, the person, number, and gender, are rather assumed in the pronoun, than regulated by an antecedent: as,

*&quot;I do not care who knows it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Steele.
*&quot;Who touched me? Tell me who it was.&quot;
*&quot;We have no knowledge how, or by whom, it is inhabited.&quot;&amp;mdash;Abbot: Joh. Dict.

===The neuter pronoun===

The neuter pronoun may be applied to a young child, or to other creatures masculine or feminine by nature, when they are not obviously distinguishable with regard to sex: as,

*&quot;Which is the real friend to the child, the person who gives it the sweetmeats, or the person who, considering only its health, resists its importunities?&quot;&amp;mdash;Opis.
*&quot;He loads the animal he is showing me, with so many trappings and collars, that I cannot distinctly view it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 301.
*&quot;The nightingale sings most sweetly when it sings in the night.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bucke's Gram., p. 52.

===The pronoun it===

The pronoun it is often used without a definite reference to any antecedent, and is sometimes a mere expletive, and sometimes the representative of an action expressed afterwards by a verb: as,

*&quot;Whether she grapple it with the pride of philosophy.&quot;&amp;mdash;Chalmers.
*&quot;Seeking to lord it over God's heritage.&quot;&amp;mdash;The Friend, vii, 253.
*&quot;It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong drink.&quot;&amp;mdash;Prov., xxxi, 4.
*&quot;Having no temptation to it, God cannot act unjustly without defiling his nature.&quot;&amp;mdash;Brown's Divinity, p. 11.
*&quot;Come, and trip it as you go, on the light fantastic toe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

===The adjective many===

A singular antecedent with the adjective many, sometimes admits a plural pronoun, but never in the same clause: as,

*&quot;Hard has been the fate of many a great genius, that while they have conferred immortality on others, they have wanted themselves some friend to embalm their names to posterity.&quot;&amp;mdash;Welwood's Pref. to Rowe's Lucan.
*&quot;In Hawick twinkled many a light, behind him soon they set in night.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Scott.

===Enallage===

When a plural pronoun is put by '''enallage''' for the singular, it does not agree with its noun in number, because it still requires a plural verb: as,

*&quot;We [Lindley Murray] have followed those authors, who appear to have given them the most natural and intelligible distribution.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., 8vo, p. 29.
*&quot;We shall close our remarks on this subject, by introducing the sentiments of Dr. Johnson respecting it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.
*&quot;My lord, you know I love you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shakespeare.

===The antecedent taken in another sense===

The pronoun sometimes disagrees with its antecedent in one sense, because it takes it in another: as,

*&quot;I have perused Mr. Johnson's Grammatical Commentaries, and find it a very laborious, learned, and useful work.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tho. Knipe, D. D.
*&quot;Lamps is of the plural number, because it means more than one.&quot;&amp;mdash;Smith's New Gram., p. 8.
*&quot;Man is of the masculine gender, because it is the name of a male.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.
*&quot;The Utica Sentinel says it has not heard whether the wounds are dangerous.&quot;&amp;mdash;Evening Post.
*Better, &quot;The editor of the Utica Sentinel says, he has not heard,&quot; etc.
*&quot;There is little Benjamin with their ruler.&quot;&amp;mdash;Psalms, lxviii, 27.
*&quot;Her end when emulation misses, she turns to envy, stings, and hisses.&quot;&amp;mdash;Swift's Poems, p. 415.

===Nominatives===

Nominatives: (i.e., words parsed as nominatives after the verbs, though mostly transposed:)

*&quot;Who are you?&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;What were we?&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.
*&quot;Do not tell them who I am.&quot;
*&quot;Let him be who he may, he is not the honest fellow that he seemed.&quot;
*&quot;The general conduct of mankind is neither what it was designed, nor what it ought to be.&quot;

===Absolute nominatives===

This construction of the relative is a latinism, and very seldom used by the best writers.

*&quot;There are certain bounds to imprudence, which being transgressed, there remains no place for repentance in the natural course of things.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bp. Butler.
*&quot;Which being so, it need not be any wonder, why I should.&quot;&amp;mdash;Walker's Particles, Pref., p. xiv.
*&quot;He offered an apology, which not being admitted, he became submissive.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Key, p. 202.

===Possessives===

*&quot;The chief man of the island, whose name was Publius.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts.
*&quot;Despair, a cruel tyrant, from whose prisons none can escape.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.
*&quot;To contemplate on Him whose yoke is easy and whose burden is light.&quot;&amp;mdash;Steele.

===Objectives===

*&quot;Those whom she persuaded.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.
*&quot;The cloak that I left at Troas.&quot;&amp;mdash;St. Paul.
*&quot;By the things which he suffered.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;A man whom there is reason to suspect.&quot;
*&quot;What are we to do?&quot;&amp;mdash;Burke.
*&quot;Love refuses nothing that love sends.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gurnall.
*&quot;The first thing, says he, is, to choose some maxim or point of morality; to inculcate which, is to be the design of his work.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 421.
*&quot;Whomsoever you please to appoint.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lowth.
*&quot;Whatsoever he does, shall prosper.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;What we are afraid to do before men, we should be afraid to think before God.&quot;&amp;mdash;Sibs.
*&quot;Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?&quot;&amp;mdash;Gen., xviii, 32.
*&quot;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am going to do?&quot;
*&quot;Call imperfection what you fancy such.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Neuter verbs===

Pronouns parsed as objectives after '''neuter verbs''', though they stand before them:

*&quot;He is not the man that I took him to be.&quot;
*&quot;Whom did you suppose me to be?&quot;
*&quot;If the lad ever become what you wish him to be.&quot;
*&quot;To whom shall we go?&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;The laws by which the world is governed, are general.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bp. Butler.
*&quot;Whom he looks on as his defender.&quot;&amp;mdash;Addison.
*&quot;That secret heaviness of heart which unthinking men are subject to.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;I cannot but think the loss of such talents as the man of whom I am speaking was master of, a more melancholy instance.&quot;&amp;mdash;Steele.
*&quot;Grammar is the solid foundation on which all other science rests.&quot;&amp;mdash;Buchanan's Eng. Synt., p. xx.

===Familiar language===

In familiar language, the relative of the objective case is frequently understood: as,

*&quot;The man [whom] I trust.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.
*&quot;Here is the letter [which] I received.&quot;
*&quot;This is the man they hate. These are the goods they bought. Are these the Gods they worship? Is this the woman you saw?&quot;&amp;mdash;Ash's Gram., p. 96.

In grave writing, or deliberate discourse, it is much better to express the relative. The omission of it is often attended with some obscurity: as,

*&quot;The next error [that] I shall mention [,] is a capital one.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames, El. of Crit., ii, 157.
*&quot;It is little [that] we know of the divine perfections.&quot;&amp;mdash;Scougal, p. 94.
*&quot;The faith [which] we give to memory, may be thought, on a superficial view, to be resolvable into consciousness, as well as that [which] we give to the immediate impressions of sense.&quot;&amp;mdash;Campbell's Rhet., p. 53.
*&quot;We speak that [which] we do know, and testify that [which] we have seen.&quot;&amp;mdash;John, iii, 11.

===A relative in the nominative case===

The omission of a relative in the nominative case, is almost always inelegant: as,

*&quot;This is the worst thing [that] could happen.&quot;
*&quot;There were several things [which] brought it on me.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pilgrim's Progress, p. 162.

This ellipsis may occur after but or than, and it is sometimes allowed in poetry: as,

*&quot;[There is] No person of reflection but [who] must be sensible, that an incident makes a stronger impression on an eyewitness, than when heard at second hand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames, El. of Crit., ii, 257.
*&quot;In this it is God directs, in that it is man.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, on Man.
*&quot;Abuse on all he loved, or loved him, spread.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id., to Arbuthnot.
*&quot;There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id., to Augustus.

===A collective noun===

When the antecedent is a collective noun conveying the idea of plurality, the pronoun must agree with it in the plural number: as,

*&quot;The council were divided in their sentiments.&quot;
*&quot;The Christian world are beginning to awake out of their slumber.&quot;&amp;mdash;C. Simeon.
*&quot;Whatever Adam's posterity lost through him, that and more they gain in Christ.&quot;&amp;mdash;J. Phipps.
*&quot;To this, one pathway gently-winding leads, where march a train with baskets on their heads.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Iliad, B. xviii, l. 657.

===Antecedents connected by or===

When a pronoun has two or more antecedents connected by or or nor, it must agree with them singly, and not as if taken together: as,

*&quot;James or John will favour us with his company.&quot;
*&quot;Neither wealth nor honour can secure the happiness of its votaries.&quot;
*&quot;What virtue or what mental grace, but men unqualified and base will boast it their possession?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper, on Friendship.

===Antecedents connected by and===

When a pronoun has two or more antecedents connected by and, it must agree with them jointly in the plural, because they are taken together: as,

*&quot;Minos and Thales sung to the lyre the laws which they composed.&quot;&amp;mdash;Strabo: Blair's Rhet., p. 379.
*&quot;Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided.&quot;&amp;mdash;2 Sam., i, 23.
*&quot;Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills, Caresus roaring down the stony hills.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Il., B. xii, l. 17.

====One person or thing====

When two or more antecedents connected by and serve merely to describe one person or thing, they are either in apposition or equivalent to one name, and do not require a plural pronoun: as,

*&quot;This great philosopher and statesman continued in public life till his eighty-second year.&quot;
*&quot;The same Spirit, light, and life, which enlightens, also sanctifies, and there is not another.&quot;&amp;mdash;Penington.
*&quot;My Constantius and Philetus confesses me two years older when I wrote it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowley's Preface.
*&quot;Remember these, O Jacob and Israel! for you are my servant.&quot;&amp;mdash;Isaiah, xliv, 21.
*&quot;In that strength and cogency which renders eloquence powerful.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 252.

====Emphatically distinguished====

When two antecedents connected by and are emphatically distinguished, they belong to different propositions, and, if singular, do not require a plural pronoun: as,

*&quot;The butler, and not the baker, was restored to his office.&quot;
*&quot;The good man, and the sinner too, shall have his reward.&quot;
*&quot;Truth, and truth only, is worth seeking for its own sake.&quot;
*&quot;It is the sense in which the word is used, and not the letters of which it is composed, that determines what is the part of speech to which it belongs.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cobbett's Gram.,  130.

====Each, every, or no====

When two or more antecedents connected by and are preceded by the adjective each, every, or no, they are taken separately, and do not require a plural pronoun: as,

*&quot;Every plant and every tree produces others after its own kind.&quot;
*&quot;It is the cause of every reproach and distress which has attended your government.&quot;&amp;mdash;Junius, Let. xxxv.

But if the latter be a collective noun, the pronoun may be plural: as,

*&quot;Each minister and each church act according to their own impressions.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. M'Cartee.

==The finite verb==

Every finite verb must agree with its subject, or nominative, in person and number: as,

*&quot;I know; You know; He knows;&quot;
*&quot;The bird flies; The birds fly.&quot;
*&quot;Our fathers' fertile fields by slaves are tilled, and Rome with dregs of foreign lands is filled.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rowe's Lucan, B. vii, l. 600.

When the nominative is a collective noun conveying the idea of plurality, the verb must agree with it in the plural number: as,

*&quot;The council were divided.&quot;
*&quot;The college of cardinals are the electors of the pope.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Key, p. 176.
*&quot;Quintus Curtius relates, that a number of them were drowned in the river Lycus.&quot;&amp;mdash;Home's Art of Thinking, p. 125.
*&quot;Yon host come learned in academic rules.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rowe's Lucan, vii, 401.
*&quot;While heaven's high host on hallelujahs live.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young's N. Th., iv, 378.

===Nominatives connected by and===

When a verb has two or more nominatives connected by and, it must agree with them jointly in the plural, because they are taken together: as,

*&quot;True rhetoric and sound logic are very nearly allied.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p.  11.
*&quot;Aggression and injury in no case justify retaliation.&quot;&amp;mdash;Wayland's Moral Science, p. 406.
*&quot;Judges and senates have been bought for gold, esteem and love were never to be sold.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

====One person or thing====

When two nominatives connected by and serve merely to describe one person or thing, they are either in apposition or equivalent to one name, and do not require a plural verb: as,

*&quot;Immediately comes a hue and cry after a gang of thieves.&quot;&amp;mdash;L'Estrange.
*&quot;The hue and cry of the country pursues him.&quot;&amp;mdash;Junius, Letter xxiii.
*&quot;Flesh and blood [i.e. man, or man's nature,] has not revealed it to you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Matt., xvi, 17.
*&quot;Descent and fall to us is adverse.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, P. L., ii, 76.

*&quot;Toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ezra, iv, 20.
*&quot;Whose icy current and compulsive course never feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shakespeare.

====Emphatically distinguished====

When two nominatives connected by and, are emphatically distinguished, they belong to different propositions, and, if singular, do not require a plural verb: as,

*&quot;Ambition, and not the safety of the state, was concerned.&quot;&amp;mdash;Goldsmith.
*&quot;Consanguinity, and not affinity, is the ground of the prohibition.&quot;&amp;mdash;Webster's Essays, p. 324.
*&quot;But a modification, and oftentimes a total change, takes place.&quot;&amp;mdash;Maunder.
*&quot;Somewhat, and, in many circumstances, a great deal too, is put on us.&quot;&amp;mdash;Butler's Analogy, p. 108.
*&quot;Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain consequence of attempting the latter.&quot;&amp;mdash;Robertson's America, i, 434.
*&quot;Ay, and no too, was no good divinity.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shakespeare.
*&quot;Love, and love only, is the loan for love.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

====Each, every, or no====

When two or more nominatives connected by and are preceded by the adjective each, every, or no, they are taken separately, and do not require a plural verb: as,

*&quot;When no part of their substance, and no one of their properties, is the same.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bp. Butler.
*&quot;Every limb and feature appears with its respective grace.&quot;&amp;mdash;Steele.

*&quot;Each worm, and each insect, is a marvel of creative power.&quot;
*&quot;Whose every look and gesture was a joke to clapping theatres and shouting crowds.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

When the verb separates its nominatives, it agrees with that which precedes it, and is understood to the rest: as,

*&quot;The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Exercises, p. 36.
*&quot;Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.
*&quot;Forth in the pleasing spring, your beauty walks, your tenderness, and love.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.

===Nominatives connected by or===

When a verb has two or more nominatives connected by or or nor, it must agree with them singly, and not as if taken together: as,

*&quot;Fear or jealousy affects him.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen's Gram., p. 133.
*&quot;Nor eye, nor listening ear, an object finds: creation sleeps.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;Neither character nor dialogue was yet understood.&quot;&amp;mdash;L. Murray's Gram., p. 151.
*&quot;The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, safest and seemliest by her husband stays.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, P. L., ix, 267.

==Infinitives==

===The infinitive mood===

The infinitive mood is governed in general by the preposition to, which commonly connects it to a finite verb: as,

*&quot;I desire to learn.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Adam.
*&quot;Of me the Roman people have many pledges, which I must strive, with my utmost endeavours, to preserve, to defend, to confirm, and to redeem.&quot;&amp;mdash;Duncan's Cicero, p. 41.
*&quot;What if the foot, ordained the dust to tread, or hand to toil, aspired to be the head?&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

The active verbs, bid, dare, feel, hear, let, make, need, see, and their participles, usually take the infinitive after them without the preposition to: as,

*&quot;If he bade you depart, how dare you stay?&quot;
*&quot;I dare not let my mind be idle as I walk in the streets.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cotton Mather.
*&quot;Your Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep, shall neither hear you sigh, nor see you weep.&quot; &amp;mdash;Pope's Homer.

Though the infinitive is commonly made an adjunct to some finite verb, yet it may be connected to almost all the other parts of speech. The preposition to being its only and almost universal index; unless the word about, in such a situation, is a preposition.

Anciently, the infinitive was sometimes preceded by for as well as to: as,

*&quot;I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, xxiv, 11.
*&quot;What went you out for to see?&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, vii, 26.
*&quot;And stood up for to read.&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, iv, 16.

It seems practicable to subjoin the infinitive to every one of
the ten parts of speech, except the article: as,

====Noun====

*&quot;If there is any precept to obtain felicity.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hawkesworth.
*&quot;It is high time to awake out of sleep.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rom., xiii, 11.
*&quot;To flee from the wrath to come.&quot;&amp;mdash;Matt., iii, 7.

====Adjective====

*&quot;He seemed desirous to speak, yet unwilling to offend.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hawkesworth.
*&quot;He who is the slowest to promise, is the quickest to perform.&quot;&amp;mdash;Art of Thinking, p. 35.

====Pronoun====

*&quot;I discovered him to be a scholar.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen's Gram., p. 166.
*&quot;Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar?&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, xx, 22.
*&quot;Let me desire you to reflect impartially.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair: Murray's Eng. Reader, p. 77.

*&quot;Then Peter began to rebuke him.&quot;&amp;mdash;Matt., xvi, 22.
*&quot;The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, xix, 10.

====Another infinitive====

*&quot;To go to enter into Egypt.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jer., xli, 17.
*&quot;We are not often willing to wait to consider.&quot;&amp;mdash;J. Abbott.
*&quot;For what had he to do to chide at me?&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.

====Participle====

*&quot;Still threatening to devour me.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.
*&quot;Or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash of some rich burgher.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.

====Adverb====

*&quot;She is old enough to go to school.&quot;
*&quot;I know not how to act.&quot;&amp;mdash;Nutting's Gram., p. 106.
*&quot;Tell me when to come, and where to meet you.&quot;
*&quot;He has not where to lay his head.&quot;

====Conjunction====

*&quot;He knows better than to trust you.&quot;
*&quot;It was so hot as to melt these ornaments.&quot;
*&quot;Many who praise virtue, do no more than praise it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

====Preposition====

*&quot;I was about to write.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rev., x, 4.
*&quot;Not for to hide it in a hedge.&quot;&amp;mdash;Burns's Poems, p. 42.
*&quot;Amatum iri, to be about to be loved.&quot;&amp;mdash;Adam's Gram., p. 95.

====Interjection====

*&quot;O to forget her!&quot;&amp;mdash;Young's Night Thoughts.

===The uses of the infinitive===

The infinitive is a verb, without affirmation, without person or number, and therefore without the agreement peculiar to a finite verb. But, in most instances, it is not without limitation of the being, action, or passion, to some persons or things, that are said, supposed, or denied, to be, to act, or to be acted on. Whenever it is not thus limited, it is taken abstractly, and has some resemblance to a noun. Even then, the active infinitive may govern the objective case. The uses of the infinitive are many and various. The following are the chief of the things for which it may stand:

====Supplement to another verb====

For the supplement to another verb, to complete the sense: as,

*&quot;Loose him, and let him go.&quot;&amp;mdash;John, xi, 44.

*&quot;They grieved to see their best allies at variance.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rev. W. Allen's Gram., p. 165.

*&quot;To do right, is, to do that which is ordered to be done.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tooke's D. P., ii, 7.
*&quot;To go to law to plague a neighbour, has in it more of malice, than of love to justice.&quot;&amp;mdash;Seattle's Mor. Sci., i, 177.

*&quot;She shall rejoice in time to come.&quot;&amp;mdash;Prov., xxxi, 25.
*&quot;Things present, or things to come.&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Cor., iii, 22.

====A necessary event====

For a necessary event, or what ought to be: as,

*&quot;It is to be remembered.&quot;
*&quot;It is never to be forgotten.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tooke's D. P., ii, 2.
*&quot;An oversight much to be deplored.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., ii, 460.
*&quot;The sign is not to be used by itself, or to stand alone; but is to be joined to some other term.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., ii, 372.
*&quot;The Lord's name is to be praised.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ps., cxiii, 3.

====Something previously suggested====

For what is previously suggested by another word: as,

*&quot;I have faith to believe.&quot;
*&quot;The glossarist did well here not to yield to his inclination.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tooke's D. P., ii, 329.
*&quot;It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ps., xcii, 1.
*&quot;It is as sport to a fool to do mischief.&quot;&amp;mdash;Prov., x, 23.
*&quot;They have the gift to know it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;We have no remaining occupation but to take care of the public.&quot;&amp;mdash;Art of Thinking, p. 52.

====Term of comparison or measure====

For a term of comparison or measure: as,

*&quot;He was so much affected as to weep.&quot;
*&quot;Who could do no less than furnish him.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tooke's D. P., ii, 408.
*&quot;I shall venture no farther than to explain the nature and convenience of these abbreviations.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., ii, 439.
*&quot;I have already said enough to show what sort of operation that is.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., ii, 358.

==Participles==

The regular syntax of the participle, is twofold; being sometimes that of simple relation to a noun or a pronoun that precedes it, and sometimes that of government, or the state of being governed by a preposition. In the former construction, the participle resembles an adjective; in the latter, it is more like a noun, or like the infinitive mood. To these constructions, some add others less regular: using the participle as the subject of a finite verb, as the object of a transitive verb, or as a nominative after a neuter verb.

Participles relate to nouns or pronouns, or else are governed by prepositions: as,

*&quot;Elizabeth's tutor, at one time paying her a visit, found her employed in reading Plato.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hume.
*&quot;I have no more pleasure in hearing a man attempting wit and failing, than in seeing a man trying to leap over a ditch and tumbling into it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.
*&quot;Now, raised on Tyre's sad ruins, Pharaoh's pride soared high, his legions threatening far and wide.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dryden.

===A preceding phrase===

A participle sometimes relates to a preceding phrase or sentence, of which it forms no part: as,

*&quot;I then quit the society; to withdraw and leave them to themselves, appearing to me a duty.&quot;
*&quot;It is almost exclusively on the ground we have mentioned, that we have heard his being continued in office defended.&quot;&amp;mdash;Professors' Reasons, p. 23.
*Better, &quot;His continuance in office,&quot; or, &quot;The continuing of him in office.&quot;
*&quot;But ever to do ill our sole delight, as being the contrary to his high will.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

===A being or action in the abstract===

With an infinitive denoting being or action in the abstract, a participle is sometimes also taken abstractly; that is, without reference to any particular noun, pronoun, or other subject: as,

*&quot;To seem compelled, is disagreeable.&quot;
*&quot;To keep always praying aloud, is plainly impossible.&quot;
*&quot;It must be disagreeable to be left pausing on a word which does not, by itself, produce any idea.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., 8vo, p. 323.
*&quot;To praise him is to serve him, and fulfill, doing and suffering, his unquestioned will.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper, Vol. i, p. 88.

===Substitute for the infinitive mood===

The participle is often used irregularly, as a substitute for the infinitive mood, to which it is sometimes equivalent without irregularity: as,

*&quot;I saw him enter, or entering.&quot;&amp;mdash;Grant's Lat. Gram., p. 230.
*&quot;He is afraid of trying, or to try.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ibid.
*&quot;Sir, said I, if the case stands thus, it is dangerous drinking.&quot;&amp;mdash;Collier's Tablet of Cebes.
*&quot;It will be but ill venturing your soul on that.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bunyan's Law and Grace, p. 27.
*&quot;Describing a past event as present, has a fine effect in language.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames, El. of Crit., i, 93.
*&quot;In English likewise it deserves remarking.&quot;&amp;mdash;Harris's Hermes, p. 232.
*&quot;Bishop Atterbury deserves being particularly mentioned.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 291.
*&quot;This, however, is in effect no more than enjoying the sweet that predominates.&quot;&amp;mdash;Campbell's Rhet., p. 43.
*&quot;Habits are soon assumed; but when we strive to strip them off, it is being flayed alive.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper, Vol. i, p. 44

===A participle which is treated as a noun===

Another frequent irregularity in the construction of participles, is the practice of treating them essentially as nouns, without taking from them the regimen and adjuncts of participles: as,

*&quot;Your having been well educated will be a great recommendation.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen's Gram., p. 171.
*Better, &quot;Your excellent education,&quot; or &quot;That you have been well educated, will be,&quot; etc.
*&quot;It arises from sublimity's expressing grandeur in its highest degree.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 29.
*&quot;Concerning the separating by a circumstance, words intimately connected.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames, El. of Crit., Vol. ii, p. 104.
*&quot;As long as there is any hope of their keeping pace with them.&quot;&amp;mdash;Literary Convention, p. 114.
*&quot;Which could only arise from his knowing the secrets of all hearts.&quot;&amp;mdash;West's Letters to a Young Lady, p. 180.
*&quot;But this again is talking quite at random.&quot;&amp;mdash;Butler's Analogy, p. 146.
*&quot;My being here it is, that holds you hence.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;Such, but by foils, the clearest lustre see, and deem aspersing others, praising you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Savage, to Walpole.

==Adverbs==

The syntax of an adverb consists in its simple relation to a verb, a participle, an adjective, or whatever else it qualifies.

Adverbs relate to verbs, participles, adjectives, or other adverbs: as,

*&quot;Any passion that habitually discomposes our temper, or unfits us for properly discharging the duties of life, has most certainly gained a very dangerous ascendency.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair.
*&quot;How blessed this happy hour, should he appear, dear to us all, to me supremely dear!&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope's Homer.

===Independent adverbs===

The adverbs yes, ay, and yea, expressing a simple affirmation, and the adverbs no and nay, expressing a simple negation, are always independent. They generally answer a question, and are equivalent to a whole sentence. Is it clear, that they ought to be called adverbs? No.

*&quot;Can honour set to a leg?  No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honour has no skill in surgery then? No.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.: First Part of Hen. IV, Act v, 1.

===The word amen===

The word amen, which is commonly called an adverb, is often used independently at the beginning or end of a declaration or a prayer: as,

*&quot;Surely, I come quickly. Amen: even so, come Lord Jesus.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rev., xxii, 20.

When it does not stand thus alone, it seems in general to be used substantively: as,

*&quot;The strangers among them stood on Gerizim, and echoed amen to the blessings.&quot;&amp;mdash;Wood's Dict.
*&quot;These things say the amen.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rev., iii, 14

===An adverb before a preposition===

An adverb before a preposition seems sometimes to relate to the latter, rather than to the verb or participle to which the preposition connects its object: as,

*&quot;This mode of pronunciation runs considerably beyond ordinary discourse.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair's Rhet., p. 334.
*&quot;Yea, all along the times of the apostasy, this was the thing that preserved the witnesses.&quot;&amp;mdash;Penington's Works, Vol. iv, p. 12.
*&quot;Right against the eastern gate, where the great sun begins his state.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, L'Allegro.

===Much, little, far, and all===

The words much, little, far, and all, being originally adjectives, are sometimes preceded by the negative not, or (except the last) by such an adverb as too, how, thus, so, or as, when they are taken substantively: as,

*&quot;Not all that glitters, is gold.&quot;
*&quot;Too much should not be offered at once.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 140.
*&quot;Thus far is consistent.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p.  161.
*&quot;Thus far is right.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lowth's Gram., p. 101.

==Conjunctions==

The syntax of conjunctions consists in the simple fact, that they link together such and such terms, and thus &quot;Mark the connections of human thought.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.

Conjunctions connect words, sentences, or parts of sentences: as,

*&quot;Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen; for we are brethren.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gen., xiii, 8.
*&quot;Ah! if she lend not arms as well as rules. What can she more than tell us we are fools?&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Introducing a sentence===

The conjunction that sometimes serves merely to introduce a sentence which is made the subject or the object of a finite verb: as,

*&quot;That mind is not matter, is certain.&quot;
*&quot;That you have wronged me, does appear in this.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;That time is mine, O Mead! to you, I owe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

===Two corresponding conjunctions===

When two corresponding conjunctions occur, in their usual order, the former should generally be parsed as referring to the latter, which is more properly the connecting word: as,

*&quot;Neither sun nor stars in many days appeared.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, xxvii, 20.
*&quot;Whether that evidence has been afforded [or not,] is a matter of investigation.&quot;&amp;mdash;Keith's Evidences, p. 18.

===Either and neither===

Either, corresponding to or, and neither, corresponding to nor or not, are sometimes transposed, so as to repeat the disjunction or negation at the end of the sentence: as,

*&quot;Where then was their capacity of standing, or his either?&quot;&amp;mdash;Barclay's Works, iii, 359.
*&quot;It is not dangerous neither.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bolingbroke, on Hist., p. 135.
*&quot;He is very tall, but not too tall neither.&quot;&amp;mdash;Spect., No. 475.

==Prepositions==

The syntax of prepositions consists, not solely or mainly in their power of governing the objective case, but in their adaptation to the other terms between which they express certain relations.

Prepositions show the relations of words, and of the things or thoughts expressed by them: as,

*&quot;He came from Rome to Paris, in the company of many eminent men, and passed with them through many cities.&quot;&amp;mdash;Analectic Magazine.
*&quot;Ah! who can tell the triumphs of the mind, by truth illumined, and by taste refined?&quot;&amp;mdash;Rogers.

===The object===

A noun or a pronoun made the object of a preposition, is governed by it in the objective case: as,

*&quot;The temple of fame stands on the grave: the flame that burns on its altars, is kindled from the ashes of great men.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hazlitt.
*&quot;Life is his gift, from whom whatever life needs, with every good and perfect gift, proceeds.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper, Vol. i, p. 95.

===The preposition to===

The preposition to, before an abstract infinitive, and at the head of a phrase which is made the subject of a verb, has no proper antecedent term of relation: as,

*&quot;To learn to die, is the great business of life.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn.
*&quot;Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh, is more needful for you.&quot;&amp;mdash;St. Paul: Phil., i, 24.
*&quot;To be reduced to poverty, is a great affliction.&quot;
*&quot;Too much to know, is, to know nought but fame; and every godfather can give a name.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shakespeare.

===The preposition for===

The preposition for, when it introduces its object before an infinitive, and the whole phrase is made the subject of a verb, has properly no antecedent term of relation: as,

*&quot;For us to learn to die, is the great business of life.&quot;
*&quot;Nevertheless, for me to abide in the flesh, is more needful for you.&quot;
*&quot;For an old man to be reduced to poverty is a very great affliction.&quot;
*&quot;For man to tell how human life began, is hard; for who himself beginning knew?&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

==Interjections==

Interjections have no dependent construction; they are put absolute, either alone, or with other words: as,

*&quot;O! let not your heart despise me.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.
*&quot;O cruel you!&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Odys., B. xii, l. 333.
*&quot;Ah wretched we, poets of earth!&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowley,
*&quot;Ah Dennis! Gildon ah! what ill-starred rage divides a friendship long confirmed by age?&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Dunciad, B. iii,

==General rules==

In the formation of sentences, the '''consistency''' and adaptation of all the words should be observed; and a regular, clear, and correspondent construction should be preserved throughout.

Words that may constitute different '''parts of speech''', must not be left doubtful as to their classification.

The '''reference''' of words to other words, or their syntactical relation according to the sense, should never be left doubtful.

A '''definition''' must include the whole class of things, which it pretends to define, and exclude everything which comes not under the name.

A '''comparison''' is a form of speech which requires some similarity or common property in the things compared; without which, it becomes a solecism.

Sentences that convey a meaning manifestly '''false''', should be changed, rejected, or contradicted. They distort language from its only worthy use; which is, to state facts, and to tell the truth.

Every writer should be careful not to '''contradict''' himself; for what is self-contradictory, is both null in argument, and bad in style.

Words that are entirely '''needless''', and especially such as encumber the expression, ought in general to be omitted.

Words '''necessary''' to the sense, or even to the melody or beauty of a sentence, ought seldom, if ever, to be omitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The article currently says
:... air-core (only a coil of wire), iron-core, and ferrite core.  Iron and ferrite types are more efficient because they conduct the magnetic field much better than air...

I suppose it depends on what you mean by &quot;efficient&quot;. If you're trying to get a high inductance value with the least amount of copper wire (least cost), then yes, air-core will use the most wire (and cost the most), making it the least &quot;efficient&quot;.
On the other hand, if by &quot;efficient&quot; you mean &quot;high Q factor -- dissipates the least amount as heat&quot;, then air-core is the *most* &quot;efficient&quot;. Right ?

Maybe there's a different way of saying this without using the ambiguous word &quot;efficient&quot;.

L=B/I? Never come across this before, but it may be true. If B=uH and H=NI then this comes to L=uN. This is something like true but there are usually some other complexities...

== how do inductors really work ? ==

Should this page go into the physics of what happens to electrons inside an inductor ?

I starting writing about ''why'' inductors work (for anyone curious about the physics behind them): &quot;Whenever an electron is accelerated...&quot;, then I realized I wasn't really sure myself.
Even though I'm an EE and I know all about ''how'' inductors work.
Why do inductors work ? What's going on with the individual electrons ? (Should I stick with a &quot;magnetic fields&quot; explanation, or with a Feynman Q.E.D. &quot;electrons and photons&quot; explanation ?)
Is that really appropriate for &quot;electronics&quot; ?
Or should we put that sort of detail over at
(currently non-existent)
http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Modern_Physics:Magnetic_Induction_and_Inductors
?

-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 00:01, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:what is the electrons and photons explanation?  i would just say that the electrons have a net drift velocity that causes a net magnetic field, and when the voltage changes the magnetic field is pushing them in the direction they were already going, so they have a kind of inertia.  i guess i don't really have a good way of explaining it either.  i guess this comes back to the question about who our target audience is, too. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:22, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)

I've read the book ''Q.E.D.'' by http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RichardFeynman WikiPedia:Richard_Feynman . In it, he describes how electrons and photons &quot;really&quot; interact (at least according to [WikiPedia:Quantum_electrodynamics]). In his explanation, there is no such thing as a &quot;magnetic field&quot; or &quot;waves&quot;. There are only particles (with &quot;quantum characteristics&quot;).
A &quot;electrons and photons&quot; explanation of electrostatics is simple. Off the top of my head: ''Every charged particle constantly spews out virtual (?) photons equally in all directions. Whenever a photon hits another charged particle of the *same* charge, it is absorbed and the momentum transfer pushes that particle &quot;away&quot; from the first charged particle. Whenever a photon hits another charged particle of the *opposite* charge, it is absorbed and the momentum transfer pulls that particle &quot;towards&quot; the first charged particle.'' See ? notice there is no electric &quot;field&quot;, only particles.

I'd like a similar explanation for the inductor (no magnetic &quot;field&quot;, only particles).
I suspect it would go something like this:
''Say we have 2 close parallel wires carrying streams of electrons in the *same* direction. If you could fly close to the wires at the same (average) speed as the electrons, you would see electrons randomly bouncing around with zero average velocity, but the nucleus (including the protons) streaming by. Because of special relativity length contraction, the protons appear to be packed closer together in their direction of travel. Since the protons are packed more densely than the electrons, the electrons in the other wire are *attracted* to the (apparent) net average positive charge. Similarly, when parallel wires carry currents in the *opposite direction ... the wires repel each other.&quot;
Is that going the right direction, or is it totally wrong ?
(EditHint: feel free to *move* this comment to a more appropriate place -- perhaps one of the [[physics]] books).
-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:19, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Pretty weird.  :-)  Aren't they both equally valid ways of thinking about the same phenomena though?  I think it is more appropriate for the physics book, and we should link to it after a basic classical description in our book.  The focus is on building circuits, not on the physics involved, but we do have to explain enough physics for them to know what their circuits are doing... - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:41, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Dosenöffner1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|can opener]]

A '''can opener''' (also known as a '''tin opener''') is a device used to open steel (not tin) cans.

Simple can openers, like those found in pocket knives, are operated by walking the device around the edge of the can while digging into the lid. The lid will have very jagged edges after removal.

Most can openers press a cutting wheel into the edge of the lid while a rough support wheel presses up under the lip of the can. It is best to purchase a can opener that drives this support wheel to provide easier motion. Non-electric can openers with this feature can be identified by a set of gears behind the cutting and support wheels. The pictured can opener has such gears, with 2 or 3 teeth visible peeking out above the cutting wheel near the bottom of the picture.

Some more unusual can openers cut into the side of the can, often within the seam area so that a nice lid is formed. The lid is not very sharp and does not fall into the food. In this case, the support (and possibly drive) wheel runs around the inside edge of the lid as the can is opened.

Be sure to clean your can opener after use. Give it a rinse, then run a paper towel through it. In case you or someone else has been careless, you might also clean the can opener before use.</text>

[[Image:Spatulas.jpg|thumb|right|Spatulas]]

A '''spatula''' is a hand-held tool that is used for lifting, flipping, or spreading. Spatulas have a handle that is long enough to keep the holder's hand away from what is being lifted or spread, as well as away from a hot surface.

The blade of the spatula is wide and thin. The shape of the blade varies, with square and rectangular shapes being most common. The blade is usually somewhat flexible. Spatula blades are often longer on the right side than the left, as this is more effective for right-handed people. There are also left-handed spatulas, but these are rarer.

Spatulas are usually made of plastic or metal, but wooden, rubber and silicone ones are also sometimes used. Metal spatulas generally have a wood or plastic handle to insulate them from the heat.

A spatula is essential for many types of cooking. They are especially needed when frying foods that need to be flipped. Spatulas can also be used to serve food. The blade of a cooking spatula is often slotted to allow liquids to flow through. In British English, this slotted utensil is called a ''fish slice''.

There are many varieties of spatula. A frosting spatula has a long, thin blade. Spatulas designed to be used with a barbecue or other open flame have longer handles. A Chinese spatula is designed to be used with a wok; one edge is curved and they are firmer, to handle large amounts of food.

Welcome IB Diploma students!

This will be the main page for study guides, education resources and revision notes created for the [[wikipedia:International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureate]] Diploma (IBDP) on [[Wikibooks portal|Wikibooks]]. Find out more about the program from the [http://www.ibo.org IB Organization]. If you want, [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|find out about Wikibooks]].

The aim is to collaborate to create a great resource for IBDP students and teachers to make their learning, study and teaching easier. There are many things to be done and everyone can contribute using the &quot;Edit this page&quot; button at the top of the pages.

* To quickly become useful, we are making a compendium of the best sites on the internet with IBDP resources. This is available at the bottom of this page. If you already use a good site, go to 'edit this page' and share it with everyone by adding it to the list! You can use these pages as a starting point for creating your own notes to contribute (they provide headings to work under) but don't copy copyrighted material.

* Begin writing pages for the IBDP subjects you know about. Write what you feel will help other students. There is no need to be perfect or comprehensive, notes can be built on and revised many times by many people. Go through your own notes or textbook and for each chapter add concise notes on concepts that need to be understood. Use headings or numbers as from your textbook or syllabus outline from the websites listed below.

[[Image:Whisk.jpg|thumb|right|Whisk]]

A '''whisk''' is a cooking utensil used in food preparation to smoothly blend ingredients or whip in air to a mixture. Most whisks consist of a long narrow handle with a series of wire loops joined at the end. The wires are usually metal, but some are coated with silicone or have plastic wires for use with non-stick cookware. Whisks are also made from bamboo.

Some whisks have different shaped loops. A wider, more tear drop shape, is commonly known as a ''balloon whisk''. A longer, more narrow shape, is often known as a ''French whisk''. A flat whisk (sometimes referred to as a ''Roux whisk'') has the loops arranged in flat successive pattern. A ''gravy whisk'' commonly has one main loop with another looped coiled around the main. A ''twirl whisk'' has one wire that is in a spiral balloon shape.

The ''ball whisk'' is a design adapted to allow more aeration of the mixture. Instead of loops, a grouping of individual wires come out of the handle and each end with a metal ball. Since there are no crossing wires, the ball whisk is much easier to clean than most other variants.</text>

[[Image:MorterPestle.jpg|thumb|right|Mortar (l) and Pestle (r)]]

A '''mortar and pestle''' is a pair of tools used with each other to grind and mix substances, such as [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]], [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|herbs, and spices]].

The mortar is a bowl-like vessel used to contain the substance to be ground. Mortars have smooth, rounded bottoms and wide mouths. The pestle is the pounding and grinding instrument. The mortar and pestle are usually made of wood. 

Inexpensive ones may be plastic, but this does not work very well. More expensive ones may be made of stone or porcelain, perhaps with a wooden handle. Wooden mortar and pestle sets should only be used with dry food, such as dried spices.

To grind spices, you should normally apply a decent amount of force in a way that causes the spices to get dragged under the sideways-moving pestle. Create a fine powder to help the spices release flavor. A bit of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], commonly needed in a recipe anyway, will make this work much better. After you have emptied out the spices, a wooden mortar-and-pestle set should be cleaned by grinding some plain salt. (you may discard the salt if you wish).  Do not wash a wooden set.

When grinding wetter ingredients, like garlic or ginger, salt can be added to give better grip and help stop the garlic cloves slipping out of the mortar when hit.

&lt;!-- Mortars are also used in cooking to prepare ingredients, grinding fresh herbs into a paste. --&gt;
In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]], very large mortars are used with wooden mallets to prepare [[Cookbook:Mochi|Mochi]]. A regular sized Japanese mortar and pestle is called ''suribachi'' and ''surikogi''.

The [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] version of this set of tools is the ''Molcajete y Tejolote'' (from Nahuatl, literally &quot;sauce bowl&quot; and &quot;stone doll&quot;), which are often made of basalt, giving them a rough finish and dark grey or black color.  They are well-suited to grinding wet ingredients such as [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillos]] and [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]].  

[[Cookbook:Pesto|Pesto]] and [[Cookbook:Tapenade|tapenade]] are traditionally prepared in a mortar and pestle, though most modern recipes recommend using a blender or food processor.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure if second languages should be included because you can't really produce syllabus guides for them. Perhaps one could just include exam help and other sorts of things. Perhaps they could be broken up into level, or they could just be links to the pages like this one [[spanish]] which already have plenty of things?

You could also write any useful grammar books, or places to learn this language, or talk about recent movies/radio programms, which could be useful to those studying IB language.  Or people could just write about one area of grammar, you know, like how direct object pronouns work or something.


True, although it's of less value than the other ones, because the IB syllabus for languages is not really specific, you just learn the language, and so one can use any spanish textbook or grammar outline. With the other subjects the exact pieces of knowledge you must know are specific, so it's possible to write them out like that. --[[User:203.26.206.7|203.26.206.7]] 13:03, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Yeh but part of the whole thing of doing IB is learning the cultures, and colloquialism, etc., so that's why movies etc would be better than nothing!!

I question the practice of writing guides that stay strictly to the syllabus. While it might be easier to write, I would think it would be more difficult for the sleep deprived IB student to read. Also, some students who have information to contribute might not be able to if they don't have the syllabus (I myself don't have syllabi for all my classes).

I propose reorganizing the subjects on the front page so as to fit under the IB Groups. Any objections?

==The IB license- what IB content are we restricted from publishing?==
So what content from the IB CAN'T we publish? I would love to see the standards published to the site. This would inform users on what the critical breadth of each standard is. 
[[User: theKaramanukian]]

== ITGS? ==
Have you considered adding a section for ITGS (Information Technology in a Global Society)?
[[User:71.111.0.172|71.111.0.172]] 14:44, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

== New resource site ==

[http://www.IBaStudent.com | lB Student Revision]
I made this site trying to fill a need. It is still quite new, and will hopefully get better with time. It is an indexation of resources, sorted by subject. Similar to the ib notes page, but with a system allowing users of the page to rate each site, making it faster to identify good study resources. I would rather not add it myself as I am not excactly none-biased. Thanks. [[User:213.167.126.215|213.167.126.215]] 08:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

== Spanish ==
Does anyone have any additional info to build up this section which an increasing number of people are taking.

==Reference Site==
The following site [http://community.ismanila.com/high/Teachers_files/..%5C..%5Cstaff/gilmorek/IB%20Syllabus.htm Physics syllabus website] requires a log in and password, therefore is inaccessible.

==Personal Opinions==

I've noticed in some places (notably TOK) that students are expressing their personal opinions about courses instead of constructive comments. I feel this is inappropriate, since the exact content and teaching style of a particular course will vary widely from classroom to class room. As well, a negative opinion of a course can be because the student disliked the instructor, or because they dislike the subject for whatever reason. 

Thoughts?
--[[User:UrsulaMin|UrsulaMin]] ([[User talk:UrsulaMin|talk]]) 19:27, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:This is a wiki: If you don't like the content, change it! I'd back you up if you're removing material which is not appropriate for the textbooks we are trying to write here. This isn't a forum you see.

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] ([[User talk:Ewen|talk]]) 19:37, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

== Need substantial rewriting ==

The whole page is messed up. It is clearly referring to the Diploma Program(me) but uses the archaic term (from 30 years ago) of IB which would have been fine when there was only the Diploma Program(me). Please folks!, get with it! The IB produces three progs, PYP, MYP and DP. regardless of how it is called in your school it is not known world wide as the &quot;IB&quot;. I've tried some clean up but there are whole pages that need rennaming and I don't have the time. In addition, pages are incorrectly named anyway (even from 2006) and subjects mostly incorrect.

where is the IB Philosophy??

== CBSE to IB in India. Useful or not for future studies in abroad? ==

Is changing school from CBSE board to IB useful in India for people who wish to go abroad for higher studies?
Is IB tougher than CBSE? Are the books and other study material better than CBSE  in IB? Are IB studying children brighter than CBSE studying children? Does IB has much scope than CBSE all over the world including India?

== Out of Date ==

A lot of the provided links are either broken or useless and should be removed. And there are many other useful links that might be listed. For example, direct links to IBO Handbooks. Moreover, an IB wikibook should not merely list the several subjects possible in the program — there are many topics general to the program that a wikibook might be useful for, and that a comprehensive source of information cannot be easily found about on the internet. I'm focusing on the Econ Wiki right now since my SL exam is coming soon, but just a thought that I'll try putting into practice later.

Just signed up for Wikibooks, but I've been watching the project for quite some time now, and I'm not new to the concept of a wiki (big wikipedia fan here :)). I'm interested in (contributing to, if my schedual allows for it) books on languages/linguistics, history, philosophy, and perhaps some computer/computer programming related stuff.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Topic 1 - Stoichiometry==

===1.1 Mole concept &amp; Avogadro's constant===

====1.1.1: Apply the mole concept to substances.====

A mole is equivalent to 6.022 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; (Avogadro's constant) units.  Chemists refer to a mole of something much as we refer to a dozen eggs; it is a convenient unit for counting.  The periodic table provides molar masses, i.e. the number of grams of an element equivalent to one mole of atoms of that specific element.  This can be extrapolated to molecules of known molecular formula.

====1.1.2: Determine the number of particles and the amount of substance (in moles).====

Number of moles = mass / molar mass (Usually found on periodic table).  The coefficients in chemical equations give the molar ratios of reactants and products i.e. 2A + 3B → C. There is 2/3 as much A as B, and 3 times more B than C involved in the reaction. Assuming the reaction goes to completion, there must be 3/2 times as much B as A for neither to remain. If this ratio is not followed, one will be a limiting reactant, and so the reaction will have some of the other reactant left over when it completes.

===1.2 Formula===

====1.2.1: Define the term molar mass (M) and calculate the mass of one mole of a species.====
The molar mass (M) is the mass of one mole's worth of a substance.  To find the atomic/molecular mass, multiply the amount of moles by the molar mass.

====1.2.2: Atomic mass, Molecular Mass, Formula Mass====
The molar mass can be found for the periodic table, and will give the mass for 1 mol of the species (or rather the average accounting for different isotopes and their relative abundance).

====1.2.3: Define the terms relative molecular mass (''Mr'') and relative atomic mass (''Ar'')====

''M''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio between the molar masses of two species. ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio of the number of atoms between two species.

====1.2.4: The difference between moles and mass====

The number of moles refers to the amount of the substance, every mol being 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; individual elements. Mass is the property which results in 'weight' in the presence of gravity. Given a molar mass, ''M'' a mass ''m'' and a number of mols ''n'' then ''n = m / M''.

====1.2.5: The difference between the molecular formula and the empirical formula====

An 'empirical formula' is the formula describing the different atoms present in a molecules, and their ratios, but not the actual number present. For example, {{chem|A|x|B|y|C|z}} could be an empirical formula if x, y, and z are in lowest common terms. The molar mass can then be used to calculate the actual numbers of each atom present per molecule. The empirical formula can be determined by percentage composition, or anything else which gives the ratios of atoms present.  A 'molecular formula', on the other hand, has the actual number of atoms present in each molecule.  It will be an integer multiple of the empirical formula.  For example, {{chem|A|2x|B|2y|C|2z}}.

:: Example:
:: ''If you are given the empirical formula with an equation {{chem|CH|3}}, and a mass of 30.08 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  What is the molecular formula of this compound?''
:: We will compare the molecular mass of the molecular formula, 30.08 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, to that of the empirical formula, found to be 15.04 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  By dividing, we find the ratio to be 2, meaning that the molecular formula must be 2 times as large as the empirical formula.  The molecular formula is therefore {{chem|C|2|H|6}}.

===1.3 Chemical Equations===

Chemical equations are a convenient, standardised system for describing [[../Chemical reactions|chemical reactions]]. They contain the following information.

*The type of '''reactants''' consumed and '''products''' formed
*The relative amounts of reactants and products
*The electrical charges on [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonding|ions]]
*The physical state of each species (e.g. solid, liquid, gas)
*The reaction conditions (e.g. temperature, catalysts)

The final two points are optional and sometimes omitted.

====Anatomy of an Equation====
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_{2 (g)} + \hbox{Cl}_{2 (g)} \to 2\hbox{HCl}_{(g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Hydrogen gas and chlorine gas will react vigorously to produce hydrogen chloride gas. The equation above illustrates this reaction. The reactants, hydrogen and chlorine, are written on the left and the products (hydrogen chloride) on the right. The large number 2 in front of HCl indicates that two molecules of HCl are produced for each 1 molecule of hydrogen and chlorine gas consumed. The 2 in subscript below H indicates that there are two hydrogen atoms in each molecule of hydrogen gas. Finally, the (g) symbols subscript to each species indicates that they are gases.

====Reacting Species====
'''Species''' in a chemical reaction is a general term used to mean atoms, molecules or ions. A species can contain more than one chemical element (HCl, for example, contains hydrogen and chlorine). Each species in a chemical equation is written:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{E}_{x}^y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''E''' is the chemical symbol for the element, '''x''' is the number of atoms of that element in the species and '''y''' is the charge (if it is an ion). 

For example, ethanol would be written &lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_2\hbox{H}_6\hbox{O}_{}&lt;/math&gt; because each molecule contains 2 carbon, 6 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atom. A magnesium ion would be written &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Mg}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; because it has a double positive charge. Finally, an ammonium ion would be written &lt;math&gt;[\hbox{NH}_4]^+&lt;/math&gt; because each molecule contains 1 nitrogen and 4 hydrogen atoms and has a charge of 1+.

====Coefficients====
The numbers in front of each species have a very important meaning - they indicate the relative amounts of the atoms that react. The number infront of each species is called a '''coefficient'''. In the above equation, for example, one H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule reacts with one Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule to produce two molecules of HCl. This can also be interpreted as ''moles'' (i.e. 1 mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 mol Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces 2 mol HCl).

====Other Information====
Occasionally, other information about a chemical reaction will be supplied in an equation (such as temperature or other reaction conditions). This information is often written above the reaction arrow. We will ignore this for now, as it only complicates matters (and it's hard to draw in TeX).

1.3.1 : The mole ratio of two species in a chemical equation is the ratio of their coefficients...ie aX + bY &amp;rarr; cZ : The ratio of X/Y is a/b, Y/Z = b/c etc.

Chemical equations are useful because they give the '''relative''' amounts of the substances that react in a chemical equation. For example, from the chemical equation for the formation of ammonia, we can see that one mole of nitrogen gas will combine with three moles of hydrogen gas to form two moles of ammonia gas.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{2 (g)} + 3\hbox{H}_{2 (g)} \to 2\hbox{NH}_{3 (g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

1.3.2 : Balancing equations...change only the coefficients, not the subscripts to make sure all atoms, and charge is conserved (half equations can be balanced by addition of electrons to either side...2 half equations can be added by making the number of electrons equal in each, then vertically adding.)

In some cases, however, we may not know the relative amounts of each substance that reacts. Fortunately, we can always find the correct '''coefficients''' of an equation (the relative amounts of each reactant and product) by applying the law of conservation of matter. Because matter can neither be created nor destroyed, the total number of each atom on one side of the equation must be the same as the total on the other. This process of finding the coefficients is known as ''balancing the equation''.

For example, assume in the above equation that we do not know how many moles of ammonia gas will be produced:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{2 (g)} + 3\hbox{H}_{2 (g)} \to ?\hbox{NH}_{3 (g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From the left side of this equation, we see that there are 2 atoms of nitrogen gas in the molecule N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2 atoms per molecule x 1 molecule), and 6 atoms of hydrogen gas in the 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (2 atoms per molecule x 3 molecules). Because of the law of conservation of matter, there must also be 2 atoms nitrogen gas and 6 atoms of hydrogen gas on the right side. Since each molecule of the the resultant ammonia gas (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) contains 1 atom of nitrogen and 3 atoms of hydrogen, 2 molecules are needed to obtain 2 atoms of nitrogen and 6 atoms of hydrogen.

In a similar manner, you can use the law of conservation of matter to solve equations containing a greater number of unknown coefficients (the relative amounts of each reactant and product), or even subscripts (the number of each element in a molecule) on either side of the equation:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_{2 (g)} + 3\hbox{H}_{2 (g)} \to ?\hbox{NH}_{3 (g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


1.3.3 : State symbols -- (s)-Solid , (l)-liquid, (g)-gas, (aq)-aqueous solution...i.e. something dissolved in water. Should be included in all chemical reactions (but won't be penalized).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{E}_{(state)} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''E''' is the chemical symbol for the element and '''(state)''' is the physical state.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #ffd6d6; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
The symbols in parentheses (in subscript below each species) indicate the physical state of each reactant or product.

*'''(s)''' means solid
*'''(l)''' means liquid
*'''(g)''' means gas
*'''(aq)''' means aqueous solution (i.e. dissolved in water)
*'''(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)''' means dissolved in ethanol - any solvent can be noted this way.

|}

====Examples====
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CH}_{4} + 2\hbox{O}_{2} \to \hbox{CO}_{2} + 2\hbox{H}_{2}\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Above is the equation for burning methane gas (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in the presence of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form carbon dioxide and water: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O respectively.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Pb}^{+2}_{(aq)} + 2\hbox{I}^{-}_{(aq)} \to \hbox{PbI}_{2 (s)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a ''precipitation'' reaction in which dissolved lead cations and iodide anions combine to form a solid yellow precipitate of lead iodide (an [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonding|ionic]] solid).

====Simple Formulas====
Moles to Particles: number of moles x (6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mole)= number of Particles

ex: 2.50 mol Zn x (6.02*10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; atoms of Zn/1 mol Zn)= 1.51 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; atoms of Zn


Particles to Moles: number of Particles * (1 mole/6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;)= number of moles

ex: 1.204 x 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; atoms Ag * (1 mol/6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; atoms Ag)= 2 moles of Ag


Moles to Mass: number of moles x (molar mass/ 1 mole)= number of grams (or other unit of measurement)

ex: 3.57 mol Al x (26.982 g Al/ 1 mol Al)= 96.3 g


Mass to Moles: number of grams * (1 mole/ molar mass)= number of moles

ex: 25.5 g Ag * (1 mol Ag/ 107.868 g Ag)= 0.236 mol

***to find molar mass
ex: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 2(mass of Na)+ mass of C + 3(mass of O)

=2(22.990)+12.011+3(15.999)

=45.98+12.001+47.997

=105.99 g Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===1.4 Mass relationships in chemical reactions===

1.4.1 : Mass is conserved throughout reactions. This fact allows masses to be calculated based on other masses in the reaction eg burning Mg in air to produce MgO and so to find the mass or Mg present in the original sample (ie purity)...can be extended to concentrations...ie titration.

1.4.2 : When a reaction contains several reactants, some may be in excess...is more is present that can be used in the reaction. The first reactant to run out is the limiting reagent (or reactant). Knowing the number of mols of the limiting reagent allows all other species to be calculated, and so the yield, and remaining quantities of other reactants.

===1.5 Solutions===

1.5.1
* Solvent - the fluid you're dissolving in e.g. water.
* Solute - something which has been dissolved to form a solution e.g. an ionic compound such as sodium hydroxide.
* Solution - a mixture of solvent and solute where the solute has dissolved into the solvent to form an indistinguishable liquid.
* Concentration - the amount of solute per volume of solution. Measured in moles per dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. moles per liter) or grams per liter.

1.5.2 : Apply the equation concentration = moles/volume...rather obvious from the units of concentration, but remember to convert everything into the same units.

1.5.3 : Use chemical equations to relate the amount of one species to the amounts of others.

Rules of thumb: Anions consisting of just one element have names ending -ide.

* Anions consisting of an element plus oxygen have names ending in -ate.

* Notable exception: OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is hydroxide, not 'hydrate'.

* If an element has two anions whose names should end in -ate, the one with fewer oxygens ends in -ite.

==1.1 MOLE CONCEPT AND AVOGADRO’S CONSTANT (2H) 1.2 FORMULAS (3H)==
===Relative molecular mass (Mr) and relative atomic mass (Ar).===
Definition: The relative isotopic mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C = 12

All other relative isotopic masses are measured relative to this standard and are not whole numbers e.g.

&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C 13.003	&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F 18.998	&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl 34.97	&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl 36.97

The IB requires you to use whole numbers as an approximation to the relative isotopic mass of every isotope.

The relative atomic mass (''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) is the average value of an element’s relative isotopic masses e.g.
''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (C) = 12 * 0.9889 + 13.0033 * 0.011 = 12.0098

What is ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (Cl) if 75.77 % is &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl and the rest is &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl?

Relative atomic masses are in your data booklet, written beneath each element’s symbol in Table 5. e.g.

The relative molecular mass (''M''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of a compound’s relative atomic masses e.g.

''M''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (CO) = 12.01 + 16.00

What is ''M''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)?

What is ''M''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)?

=== Calculating the mass of one mole of a species from its formula.===
Another way of saying the same thing is to use the term ‘Molar mass’

The molar mass (M) of carbon-12 atoms is 12 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

NB Molar mass has units (it is not ‘relative’)

You must specify if it refers to atoms, isotopes, molecules, etc.

===Applying the mole concept to substances.=== 
Definition: A mole of particles contains the same number of particles as there are atoms in 12 g of carbon-12.

It turns out that there are 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles per mole.

6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is Avogadro’s constant

===Solving problems involving amount, mass and molar mass.===
Maths (learn this thoroughly):

Mass = Amount x Molar mass

or

m = nM

or

Grams = Moles x Grams per mole

7.	How much nitrogen contains the same number of atoms as there are sulphur atoms in 3.96 grams of ammonium sulphate ([NH4]2SO4)?

8.	What mass of manganese contains twice the number of atoms that there in 0.6 grams of carbon?

===Empirical formula and molecular formula.=== 
Empirical formula: the simplest expression of the proportions of the elements in a compound.
The empirical formula can be obtained from the proportions of masses of each element.

Molecular formula: the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of a compound.

Sometimes the two formulae are the same: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, for example, is both the molecular and empirical formula.

Hydrogen peroxide has an empirical formula of HO but its molar mass is 34 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Its molecular formula is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

EXERCISE 4

Calculate the empirical formula of each compound

==1.3 CHEMICAL EQUATIONS (1H)==
===Balancing chemical equations===
Once you know the formulae of the chemicals in a reaction, you need to make a balanced chemical equation.

You cannot change the formulae of the chemicals.

You can only add coefficients to indicate how many molecules of each chemical react.

'''Example 1'''

:C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C + HCl

This is unbalanced. Let’s balance the carbons first:

:1 C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 10 C + HCl

Now let’s try the hydrogens:

:1 C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 10 C + 16 HCl

Finally, time for the chlorines:

:C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 10 C + 16 HCl

'''Example 2'''

:Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This is unbalanced. Let’s balance the silicon first:

:1 Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Now let’s try the hydrogens:

:2 Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Finally, time for the oxygens:

:4 Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Here is a trick you can use to guide you in steps 2 and 3:

:1 Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

'''Example 3'''

:Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + HF

I don’t like the calcium. It appears in more than two compounds here. Next in line is fluorine:

:1 Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HF

The phosphate and sulphate can be treated as units:

:1 Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HF

:1 Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;FF0000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;font color=&quot;FF0000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt; CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HF

Note that although we have coefficients for every substance, the coefficients 1, 3 and 2 are not balanced with the coefficients &lt;font color=&quot;FF0000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;FF0000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt; – so I write them in two different colours.

The hydrogens look tricky too, but it’s either them or the calcium now:

EXERCISE 7
Can you add state symbols to the equations above?
Aqueous solutions and Ionic equations
Many substances dissolve in water to form aqueous solutions.
Ionic substances are usually soluble, separating into their component ions:
Al2(SO4)3 (s)  2 Al+3(aq) + 3 SO4-2(aq)
The mobility of the ions in solution means that these solutions will conduct electricity (though the solid substance will not).
Covalent substances do not usually dissolve in water.
If they do dissolve, the molecules remain intact:
C6H12O6(s)  C6H12O6(aq) 
When no more solute can be dissolved in a solvent, the solution is said to be saturated.

Ionic equations describe only the ions that react, omitting other (‘spectator’) ions.
AgNO3 (aq) + NaCl(aq) ® AgCl(s) + NaNO3 (aq)
Each aqueous compound can be treated as a pair of ions:
Ag+(aq) + NO-3 (aq) + Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq) ® AgCl(s) + Na+(aq) + NO-3 (aq)
The sodium and nitrate ions do not take part in the reaction
Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq) ® AgCl(s)
This treatment simplifies the equation and makes it more generally applicable. E.g. What if silver fluoride and potassium chloride solutions were mixed?
When an acid and an alkali react, ionic equations can be very useful:
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) react to form sodium chloride and water
Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) react to form magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) and water
Treating Na+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO42- as spectator ions, what is the common ionic equation when a hydroxide reacts with an acid?
EXERCISE 8
Write balanced equations for the following reactions. Put in the physical states in the appropriate manner and write the ionic equation as well where this is appropriate (numbers 1, 2, 5, 11, &amp; 15). Occasionally, oxygen appears as reactant but is not in any of the named products. In these cases, assume it is converted into water.
1. Iron filings reacting with dilute hydrochloric acid to give hydrogen plus iron II chloride solution.
2. Zinc oxide powder dissolves in dilute hydrochloric acid to give zinc chloride and water.
3. In the Contact process, sulphur dioxide and oxygen combine to form sulphur trioxide in the presence of vanadium V oxide catalyst and at a temperature of 450°C.
4. When crystalline potassium nitrate [nitrate (V)] is heated, oxygen is given off and a residue of potassium nitrite [nitrate (III)] remains.
5. When chlorine is bubbled into aqueous potassium iodide, a ppt. of iodine is formed along with a solution of potassium chloride.
6. The effect of heat on dilead II lead IV oxide (Pb3O4) is to produce oxygen, leaving lead II oxide behind.

9. If carbon dioxide is allowed to continue to bubble through the solution from (8) for a long time, the ppt redissolves, forming calcium hydrogencarbonate.
10. In the blast furnace, carbon monoxide reduces iron III oxide to molten iron while being oxidised itself into carbon dioxide.
11. The chemical test for a sulphate is to add barium chloride solution to a solution of the test sample. A white ppt. of barium sulphate indicates a positive result.
12. Magnesium burns in an extremely exothermic reaction in which magnesium oxide is the product.
13. When conc. sulphuric acid (a liquid) is poured onto common salt, fumes of hydrogen chloride are observed, while sodium hydrogensulphate remains in the test tube.
14. A solution of hydrogen peroxide will decompose spontaneously, in the presence of manganese IV oxide catalyst, to liberate oxygen.
15. When solutions of ammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide were heated together, the smell of ammonia was observed. Sodium chloride was one of the other products.

===Avogadro’s law of volumes of gases.===
Avogadro’s law: Equal volumes of gases, at the same pressure and temperature, contain equal amounts of molecules.
The law can be used to find the volumes of gases in a reaction:
e.g. 1 dm3 of hydrogen will react with 1 dm3 of chlorine to give 2 dm3 of hydrogen chloride.

What is the relationship between pressure and temperature?

What is the gradient of the graph?

Use the gradient to estimate the temperature required for the pressure to be 101325 Pa (1 atm).

===Molar volume of a gas===
A mole of any gas at 298 K and 1 atmosphere pressure occupies 24 dm3. At 273 K the volume is 22.4 dm3.
E.g. 2 moles of argon atoms occupy 48 dm3
0.5 moles of oxygen molecules occupy 12 dm3
What is the volume of carbon dioxide that is produced when 50 g of calcium carbonate decomposes?
CaCO3 ® CaO + CO2

===The relationship between temperature, pressure and volume for a fixed mass of an ideal gas.===
We can summarize the behavior of an ideal gas with this equation:

PV = nRT

P is the pressure (in Pa or N m-2)

V is the volume (m3)

n is the number of moles of the gas

R is the ideal gas constant (=8.31 J K-1 mol-1)

T is the absolute temperature (K)

You can see from this that if pressure increase, either the volume must decrease or the temperature increases. Similarly, increasing temperature causes increased volume and/or pressure.
 
EXERCISE 12

Use PV = nRT to calculate:
a)	The volume occupied by 1 mol of a gas at 25 oC (298 K) and 100000 Pa (1 bar) pressure.

b)	The pressure required to make 5 mol of gas occupy 50 dm3 (50 x 10-3 m3) at 35 oC.

c)	The number of moles of gas which occupy 25 dm3 at 85 oC and 1.05 bar.

d)	The temperature of a 3 mol gas sample which has a volume of 18 dm3 at 1 atm (1.013 bar) pressure.

If we change the conditions for a given sample of gas, we can simplify the equation considerably.
Call the initial pressure, temperature and volume P1, T1 and V1, and the values after the conditions have changed are called P2, T2 and V2.
The amount of gas, n, and the constant, R, are the same in both cases. This gives us the formula:
  =  P1*V1 / T1 = P2*V2 / T2
The ‘1’ and ‘2’ refer to the volume (V) of the gas under different conditions of Pressure (P) and Absolute Temperature (T - measured in kelvins)
Helpfully, the pressure and volume do not now have to measured in Pa and m3. Any units are suitable, so long as the same units are used for P1and P2, and for T1 and T2.

EXERCISE 13

1. Use the simplified equation (and answers to the previous exercise) to calculate:

a)	The volume occupied by 1 mol of a gas at 0 oC and 100000 Pa (1 bar) pressure.

b)	The pressure required to make 5 mol of gas occupy 40 dm3 (50 x 10-3 m3) at 35 oC.

c)	The temperature of a 3 mol gas sample which has a volume of 25 dm3 at 1 atm (1.013 bar) pressure.

d)	If a sample of gas which occupies 26.25 dm3 at 120.8 oC and 1.10 bar could be the same as a sample which occupies 25 dm3 at 85 oC and 1.05 bar.

2. If 1 dm3 of gas is warmed from 298 to 745 K, while the pressure is kept constant at 1 atm, what is its new volume?

3. What pressure is now required to pressurize the hot gas until it reaches its original volume?

==1.5 SOLUTIONS (2H)==
===Solute, solvent, solution and concentration===
Concentration (c) is measured as the quantity of solute per unit volume (usually per dm3 i.e. dm-3) of solution (not solvent).
Remember that 1 dm3 = 1000 cm3
The solute quantity can be measured as mass, so the units are g dm-3.
cm = m/v	mass concentration = mass / volume
The solute quantity can be measured as amount, so the units are mol dm-3.
cn = n/v	molar concentration = amount / volume
The molar concentration of a substance is often written in the shorthand form [substance]. E.g. Instead of writing ‘The molar concentration of NaCl’ we can write [NaCl].

EXERCISE 14

1)	Write down all the possible mathematical expressions which might be needed when doing calculations based on volumetric analysis (titrations).

2)	What is the mass concentration if 5 g of NaCl are dissolved in 500 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of solution?

3)	What is the amount of 5 g of NaCl?

4)	What is the molar concentration if 5 g of NaCl are dissolved in 500 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of solution?

5)	25 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrochloric acid (0.12 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) were just neutralized by 28.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of sodium hydroxide solution. Calculate the concentration of the base.

6)	23.2 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrochloric acid were required to cause the formation of the very pale grey colour - almost colourless - of screened methyl orange indicator in 25.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of potassium hydroxide solution. Determine the concentration of the acid given that the potassium hydroxide was made by dissolving 1.372 g in 250.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of solution.

7)	A sample of lithium hydroxide was weighed as 0.62 g. It was dissolved in water &amp; made up to 250.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 25.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; aliquots were titrated and 21.25 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of standard hydrochloric acid (0.100 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) were required. The lithium hydroxide is thought to be contaminated with lithium chloride. Calculate the mass of lithium hydroxide in the sample and hence its percentage purity.

8)	Butanedioic acid is a dibasic acid (diprotic acid) of molecular formula C4H6O4. 1.0073 g were weighed, dissolved in water and the solution made up to 250 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; portions required 23.95 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of potassium hydroxide solution to cause the colour change of a suitable indicator. Calculate the concentration of the alkali. 

:a)	What amount of butanedioic acid was used (how many moles)?

:b)	What amount was used in each titration?

:c)	What amount (mol) of potassium hydroxide was present in each titration?

:d)	What is the concentration of potassium hydroxide?

9)	A technician was asked to analyse a solution of commercial caustic soda for its sodium hydroxide &amp; sodium carbonate content. She did this by titrating a 25.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; portion with hydrochloric acid solution (0.100 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.) using firstly phenolphthalein and then, as part of the same titration, by adding methyl orange.

Results obtained were 16.90 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of acid to bring about the colour change of the phenolphthalein and a total end point of 24.55 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 

At the first colour change (phenolphthalein goes pink to colourless), the reactions taking place are:

OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  H2O &amp; also CO3&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  HCO3&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.

At the second colour change (methyl orange turns green to red), the reaction taking place is 

HCO3&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  CO2 + H2O

Thus the first part of the titration relates to the concentration of hydroxide plus carbonate. The second part refers to the concentration of the carbonate (in its hydrogencarbonate form) only. 

:a)	Calculate the number of moles of acid used in the first part and thus the total number of moles of hydroxide plus carbonate in the 25.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; portion. 

:b)	Calculate the volume and hence the number of moles of acid used in the second part of the titration and thus the number of moles of hydrogencarbonate (and thus carbonate). 

:c)	From a) &amp; b) calculate the number of moles of hydroxide and of carbonate in the 25.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; portion. From these results calculate the concentrations of the sodium hydroxide &amp; sodium carbonate in the solution. Give your answer in each case in mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp; also in g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.

10)	1.483 g of the mineral Dolomite were added to excess hydrochloric acid (50 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.0 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;). After reaction was complete, the solution was filtered and made up to 250 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. 25 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; portions of this solution containing unreacted acid were titrated against 0.1 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; KOH when a mean titre of 26.3 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was obtained. Assuming that Dolomite is essentially magnesium carbonate plus insoluble silica, calculate its percentage composition.

:a)	What amount of potassium hydroxide was in the 26.3 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;?

:b)	What amount of hydrochloric acid would have reacted with this?

:c)	What amount of hydrocloric acid was in the 250 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; solution?

:d)	What amount of acid was taken at the start?

:e)	What amount of acid reacted with the Dolomite?

:f)	Calculate the amount and hence the mass of magnesium carbonate which would have reacted with the hydrochloric acid.

:g)	Calculate the percentage by mass of magnesium carbonate in Dolomite.

2.1 The Nuclear Atom

2.1.1 : Protons and Neutrons form the nucleus of the atom, electrons orbit the nucleus in electron shells. 

2.1.2 : Protons -- Mass = 1 amu , charge = +1 .. Neutrons -- Mass = 1 amu , charge = 0 .. Electron -- Mass = 1/1840 amu (usually insignificant), charge = -1

Atoms are made up of a '''nucleus''' and '''electrons''' that orbit the nucleus.

===The nucleus===
The nucleus is made up of positively charged '''protons''',  and '''neutrons''', which have no charge but about the same mass as a proton. 

===Electrons===
'''Electrons''' are negatively charged and fly around the nucleus of an atom very quickly. So far, they do not appear to be made up of anything smaller: they are fundamental particles. They are extremely tiny, so small in fact that no one has managed to detect any size whatsoever. They are also very light, much much lighter than either a proton or a neutron. Hence, the weight of the electron is not included in the atomic number.

An atom in its natural, uncharged state has the same number of electrons as protons. If it gains or loses electrons, the atom acquires a charge and is then referred to as an '''ion'''.  The number of protons in an atom defines its chemical identity (e.g. hydrogen, gold, argon, etc).  Protons are not gained or lost through chemical reactions, but only through high energy nuclear processes.

2.1.3 : Mass number (A) -- Number of protons + neutrons. Atomic number (Z) -- number of proton. Isotope -- atoms with same atomic number but different mass number (i.e. different numbers of neutrons)

2.1.4 : AZX... A = mass number, Z = atomic number, X = atomic symbol.

2.1.5 : Isotopes may differ in physical properties (mass/density) and radioactivity but not generally in chemical properties.

2.1.6 : Atomic masses are the average of the atomic mass of each isotope (isotopic mass) times the isotope's relative abundance. results in non integer atomic masses

2.1.7 : Atomic number = number of protons (or number of electrons - ionic charge) , mass number - atomic number = number of neutrons.

2.2 Electron Arrangement

2.2.1 : Continuous spectrum goes continuously through red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A line spectrum contains only some individual lines from this spectrum.

2.2.2 : Electrons are excited (usually by running an electric current through them). This causes electrons to 'jump' into higher electron shells ( X -&gt; X* ) this state is only temporary, however, and the electron falls back to it's ground state. This change (When the electron falls back from the higher shell to a lower one) decreases the energy of the electron, and this energy is emitted in the form of a photon. If this photon falls into the visible spectrum of light, then it produces a visible spectrum. As electrons move further away from the nucleus, the electron shells become closer together in terms of space and energy, and so lines converge towards the end of the spectrum.

==Wave nature of electrons==
Electrons behave as particles but also as waves. 

One of the results of this observation is that electrons can not orbit with any energy they like. Think of a standing wave on a guitar string. Only a whole number of half wavelengths will fit in the string to form a standing wave, likewise for an atomic shell. Since the energy is dependent on the wavelength this means that the energy of an electron in an atom (a bound electron) is '''quantized'''. This means that the energy is limited to certain distinct values, one for each shell with no middle values allowed.

2.2.3 : The main electron levels go : 2, 8, 18 etc...2n + 2 for n0, n1 and n2...

2.2.4 : Electrons are added from the left...after each shell is filled, move to the next...2, 8, 18...only up to Z = 20 is required.


=HL Material=

Topic 12 is the additional HL material for Topic 2.

It's not just the energy that is quantized, other properties that an electron can posess are also split into distinct units with no in betweens. The '''angular momentum''' is quantised, the '''spin''' is quantised, the '''component of the angular moment''' in ''any'' direction that you care to choose is quantised. There are in fact a whole host of rules determining the values that each of these properties can take. 

===Electron shells===

Each different shell is subdivided into one or more '''orbitals''',  each of which  has a different angular momentum. Each shell in an orbital has a characteristic shape, and are named by a letter. They are: '''s''', '''p''', '''d''', and '''f'''. 

In a one electron atom (e.g H, He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; etc.) the energy of each of the orbitals within a particular shell are all identical. However when there is more than one electron, they interact with one another and split the orbitals into slightly different energies. Within any particular shell, the energy of the orbitals depends on the angular momentum, with the s orbital having the lowest energy, then p, then d, etc.

==The s Orbital==
The simplest orbital in the atom is the 1s orbital. The 1s orbital is simply a sphere of electron density. 

There is only one s orbital per shell. The s orbital can hold two electrons, as long as they have different spin quantum numbers.

==The &quot;P&quot; Orbitals==

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;margin:0 1em 1em 0;width:150px;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:2p_orbitals.jpg|Atomic 2p orbitals]] --&gt;&lt;br&gt;''Stylised image of all the 2p atomic orbitals.''&lt;/div&gt;Starting from the 2nd shell, there is a set of p orbitals. The angular momentum quantum number of the electrons confined to p orbitals is 1, so each orbital has one '''angular node'''. There are 3 choices for the magnetic quantum number, which indicates 3 differently orientated p orbitals. Finally, each orbital can accommodate two electrons (with opposite spins), giving the p orbitals a total capacity of 6 electrons.

The p orbitals all have two lobes of electron density pointing along each of the axes. Each one is symmetrical along its axis. The notation for the p orbitals indicate which axis it points down, i.e. p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; points along the x axis, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; on the y axis and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; up and down the z axis. The p orbitals are '''degenerate''', they all have the same energy. P orbitals are very often involved in '''bonding'''.

==The &quot;D&quot; Orbitals==

The first set of d orbitals is the 3d set. There are 5 choices for the magnetic quantum number, which gives rise to 5 different d orbitals. Each orbital can hold two electrons (with opposite spins), giving the d orbitals a total capacity of 10 electrons.

Note that you are only required to know the shapes of s and p orbitals for the IB.

In most cases, the d orbitals are '''degenerate''', but sometimes, they can split, with the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; subsets having different energy. '''Crystal Field Theory''' predicts and accounts for this. D orbitals are sometimes involved in bonding, especially in inorganic chemistry.

TOK: What is the significance of the model of the atom in the different areas of knowledge? Are the models and theories that scientists create accurate descriptions of the natural world, or are they primarily useful interpretations for prediction, explanation and control of the natural world?
===The position of protons, neutrons and electrons in the atom.===
Here is a typical atom, helium:

[[Image:Atom.svg]]
  
TOK: None of these particles can be (or will be) directly observed. Which ways of knowing do we use to interpret indirect evidence gained through the use of technology? Do we believe or know of their existence?

=== the relative mass and relative charge of protons, electrons and neutrons.===
The accepted values are:
{|

|-
|proton
|1

|-
|neutron
|1
|0

|electron
|1/1840

|}

The mass of the atom is due to its &lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;nucleons (protons and neutrons)&lt;/font&gt;.

An atom is electrically neutral because it has equal numbers of protons and electrons &lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;electrons and protons&lt;/font&gt;.

Chemistry is due to the behaviour  &lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;electrons&lt;/font&gt;.

=== The terms mass number (A), atomic number (Z) and isotopes of an element.===

The atomic number of an atom is &lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;the number of protons&lt;/font&gt;.

The mass number of an atom is the &lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;number of nucleons&lt;/font&gt;.

The atomic number defines which element we are talking about. ‘Element 16’ could be used instead of ‘sulphur’.

===The symbols for isotopes===

The following notation should be used &lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;X, for example &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C

Give the symbols for the following isotopes:

{|
|Carbon-13
|Uranium-235
|Strontium-90
|Phosphorus-32
|-
|&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;/font&gt;

|&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;/font&gt;
|}

===The properties of the isotopes of an element.===
Isotopes have the same chemical properties but different physical properties.

‘Heavy water’ (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) has the following properties:

Boiling point: 101.42 °C at standard pressure. 

Freezing point: 3.81 °C at standard pressure. 

Relative density: 1107 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; at STP.

Hydrogen-3 (‘Tritium’, T) is radioactive with a half-life of 12.32 years.

Carbon-14 is radioactive with a half-life of 5730 years.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; normally has a density of 1.83 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; but if made with carbon-14 it would have a density of 1.92 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

The density of chlorine-35 gas is 2.92 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; under standard conditions, but chlorine-37 gas is 3.08 g dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===The uses of radioisotopes===
====&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C in radiocarbon dating====

Living things constantly accumulate carbon-14 but the isotope decays with a half-life of 5730 y.

After death, accumulation stops but the decay continues, so the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 can be used to calculate how long ago death occurred.

This can be used to date organic material from archaeological sites.

====&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co in radiotherapy====

Cobalt-60 emits gamma radiation which can be directed onto tumours in an attempt to kill their cancerous cells. Whole-body irradiation can be used to destroy bone marrow before a transplant is attempted.

====&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I and &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I as medical tracers====

The thyroid is the only organ of the body which accumulates iodine, so isotopes of iodine can be used to study thyroid disorders. Iodine-131 or iodine-125 are given to patients in very low doses, and the pattern of radiation can reveal tumours or other abnormal growths.
Larger doses of iodine radioisotopes can be used as therapy for thyroid cancer.

==2.2 THE MASS SPECTROMETER==
===The operation of a mass spectrometer.===

[[Image:Mass_spectrometer_schematics.png|676 px]]

''Schematic diagram of a mass spectrometer.''

===How the mass spectrometer may be used to determine relative atomic mass===
By varying the strength of the magnetic field, ions of different masses can be brought to focus on the detector. In this way the relative abundances of ions of different masses produced from the sample can be determined. This is known as a mass spectrum. Usually the electron bombardment is adjusted to produce ions with only a single charge. Any doubly charged ions will be deflected more than the singly charged ions and will in fact behave in the same way as a singly charged ion of half the mass. That is why the x-axis is labeled m/z, where m is the relative mass of the species and z its relative charge. For example, Sulfur-32 (2+) will be observed at m/z=16.

===Calculation of non-integer relative atomic masses and abundance of isotopes===
The relative atomic masses of many elements are not whole numbers. This is because they are mixtures of isotopes. Each isotope has a molar mass which is (almost) an integer e.g. the molar mass of chlorine-35 is 35.0 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and chlorine-37 is 37.0 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Chlorine is a mixture of 24 % chlorine-37 and 76 % chlorine-35.

The molar mass is therefore:
37 x 0.24 + 35 x 0.76 = 35.48

&lt;font color='#888888'&gt;Secret information: Carbon-12 is the only isotope with an exact integer for its molar mass. Other isotopes have molar masses which are almost, but not quite, whole numbers. The IB don’t require you to know this – but it explains why the values you calculate don’t always match the values in your data booklet.&lt;/font&gt;

This is the mass spectrum of mercury. There are two types of information we can find from this spectrum:

Mercury has six isotopes

Mercury-202 is the most common isotope
 
The molar mass of mercury is actually the average of the molar masses of its isotopes. From the table we can read these values:

{|
!Isotope
!Signal strength
|-
|198
|33.8 %
|-
|199
|56.4 %
|-
|200
|77.5 %
|-
|201
|44.3 %
|-
|202
|100 %
|-
|204
|23.0 %
|}

Note that ‘%’ does not mean ‘percent of the total mercury ions’. It means ‘percent of the most intense signal’. The total ‘percentage’ is 335 %.

To find the average, we treat ‘%’ as moles:

33.8 moles of mercury-198 have a mass of 6692.4 g

{|
!Molar mass of isotope
(g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
!Amount (mol)
!Mass (g)
|-
|198	
|33.8	
|6692.4
|-
|199	
|56.4	
|11223.6
|-
|200	
|77.5	
|15500
|-
|201	
|44.3	
|8904.3

|202

|20200
|-
|204	
|23.0	
|4692
|-
|total	
|335.0 mol	
|67212.3 g
|}

So we have a molar mass for the average mercury atom:   = 200.6 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

==2.3 ELECTRON ARRANGEMENT (2H)==
===The electromagnetic spectrum.===
The electromagnetic spectrum unifies a vast range of ‘waves’, ‘rays’ and ‘radiation’.

All electromagnetic radiation travels at 299776 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in a vacuum.

Parts of the spectrum can be specified by their wavelength, frequency, or energy.

[[Image:TheElectromagneticSpectrum.jpg|700px]]

''The electromagnetic spectrum. The red line indicates the room temperature thermal energy. 
(Opensource Handbook of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology). The energies are quoted in eV: 1 eV is 96.5 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.''

The frequency is directly proportional to the energy, and inversely proportional to the wavelength.

When transferring energy, electromagnetic radiation behaves as ‘packets’ of energy known as ‘photons’.

Visible light has wavelengths of 400 (blue) to 700 (red) nm, which corresponds to energies of 299 (blue) to 171 (red) kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is too small to interact with electrons in most bonds, but too large to set bonds resonating.

Infrared light has wavelengths of 0.7 to 1000 um, and carries energies (less than 171 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) which can set bonds vibrating. In this way, infrared efficiently carries thermal energy.

Ultraviolet light has wavelengths of 1-400 nm, which gives the waves enough energy (300+ kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) to disrupt most chemical bonds.

===A continuous spectrum and a line spectrum.===

A continuous emission spectrum shows emission over a wide range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation:

A line emission spectrum only shows emissions at certain wavelengths, with no emission at intermediate wavelengths.

The diagram below shows the line emission spectrum of hydrogen, and the continuous emission spectrum of a black body at 10000 K.
 
===How the lines in the emission spectrum of hydrogen are related to electron energy levels.===

When hydrogen gas is stimulated, it emits a characteristic set of spectral lines. The gas is usually stimulated by passing a current through a sample of the gas at low pressure, but the same effect occurs if hydrogen gas is heated strongly.

The spectral lines have the following characteristics:

There are several series of lines, which become more closely packed at higher frequencies (lower wavelengths) until finally the series ends.

The highest frequency series, discovered by Lyman, is in the ultraviolet. Lower frequency series are in the visible and infrared:

{|
!Series
!Convergence limit
|-
|Lyman
|91 nm (UV)
|-
|Balmer
|365 nm (Visible)
|-
|Paschen
|821 nm (IR)
|-
|Brackett
|1.46 μm (IR)
|-
|Pfund
|2.28 μm (IR)
|}

[[Image:Spectral lines of the hydrogen atom.svg|700 px]]
''Spectral lines of the hydrogen atom.''

The lines are emitted by electrons in the hydrogen atoms. The electrons are ‘excited’ by the energy input to the hydrogen sample (usually electrical current).

‘Excitation’ means that the electron leaves its usual low energy orbit (its ‘ground state’) and enters a higher-energy orbit. The orbits of electrons are often called ‘shells’.

Excited electrons eventually ‘relax’ to lower-energy orbits. They emit the excess energy in the form of photons.

From the emission spectrum patterns we can deduce two things:

a) Because we observe a line spectrum, we know that there are only a limited number of higher-energy orbits for excited electrons.

b) The energy of each successive orbit/shell converges to a maximum value, because each series of lines converges at higher energy.

The Lyman series is caused by electrons relaxing directly to the ground state.

Ionisation energy:

The first ionisation energy is the energy required to remove an electron from each atom in a mole of gaseous atoms.

e.g. Ca (g) → Ca&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(g) + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The convergence limit of the Lyman series is related to the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom: The maximum energy photon emitted in the Lyman series is the highest energy an electron can have while still remaining part of the hydrogen atom.

The lower-energy series are caused by electrons relaxing, but not to the ground state. The Balmer series, for example, is due to photons emitted as electrons relax to the orbit with the second-lowest energy (to ‘the second shell’).

Homework

Which element would produce a graph like this?

Explain the shape of the graph.

===Evidence from first ionization energies and sub-levels.===
Use your data booklet to plot a graph of the first ionisation energies of the elements Li to Ne.
Why do the ionisation energies generally increase from Li to Ne?

&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;
The charge on the nucleus increases from Li to Ne. If we subtract the charge of the inner shell of electrons we can calculate the charge exerted on the outer electron shell: The effective nuclear charge. Because each element in the period has the same number of inner-shell electrons, the effective nuclear charge increases from 1 (Li) to 8 (Ne). The increased charge holding the outer electrons in place increases the energy required to remove one of these electrons. (It also reduces the size of the atom: Li is larger than Ne).
&lt;/font&gt;

Why do the ionisation energies of boron and oxygen break the general trend?

&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;
The s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; arrangement is stable (like 'noble gas configurations' are stable).

Boron has a [He] 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; arrangement. Losing the p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron returns boron to this stable state, so losing this electron is suprisingly easy.

Similarly, the s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; arrangement is stable.

Oxygen has a [He] 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; arrangement. Losing a p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; electron returns oxygen to this stable state, so losing this electron is surprisingly easy.
&lt;/font&gt;

===The relative energies of s, p, d and f orbitals.===
===The maximum number of orbitals in a given energy level.===

Each energy level (‘shell’) is made of orbitals (‘sub-shells’).

Each orbital can hold two electrons.

The number of orbital types is equal to the shell number e.g. shell 3 has three types of orbital, s p and d.

Shell 1	&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;1s&lt;/font&gt;

Shell 2	&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;2s 2p&lt;/font&gt;

Shell 3	&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;3s 3p 3d&lt;/font&gt;

Shell 4	&lt;font color='#ffffff'&gt;4s 4p 4d 4f&lt;/font&gt;

Shell 5 has, in theory, five types of orbital. No known element uses its g orbitals, however.

The orbitals in each shell have increasing energy. s is least energetic, then p, d, f, etc.
There is only one s orbital per shell. There are three p orbitals, five d orbitals, etc.

===The shapes of s, p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals.===

s orbitals are simple spheres:
 
The three p orbitals are aligned along the x y and z axes:

[[Image:AOs-3D-dots.png|500px]]

''The orbitals of shells 1 and 2 shown as (top) a cloud of possible electron positions and (bottom) surfaces containing most of the electron character.''

===The Aufbau principle, Hund’s rule and the Pauli exclusion principle===
The aufbau principle: To find the electron configuration of an element, we build up the electrons one by one, putting each electron into the orbital with the lowest available energy.
An easy way to remember which is the lowest available orbital is to use the following diagram:

1s

2s	2p	

3s	3p	3d

4s	4p	4d	4f

5s	5p	5d	5f	…

6s	6p	6d	…

7s	7p	…

Hund’s rule: If there is more than one orbital to choose from e.g. the 2p orbitals, then the orbitals are filled with one electron each, and then with pairs of electrons.

The electron configuration of nitrogen is:

1s		2s		2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;	2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;	2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;

↑↓		↑↓		↑	↑	↑

And not:

1s		2s		2p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;	2p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;	2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;

↑↓		↑↓		↑↓	↑	

The simplest way to write the full electronic configuration is to note the last noble gas and then to add any extra electrons like so:

Vanadium: 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Vanadium: [Ar] 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

It does not matter if you write the orbitals in the order they are filled (as in the example above) or in order of their shells:

Vanadium: [Ar] 3d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Elements 24 and 29 are special cases. The 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; configurations are so stable that an electron is taken from the 4s orbital to create 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and 3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; configurations.

e.g. Chromium is not: [Ar] 4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
Chromium is: [Ar] 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

===3.1 The Periodic Table===

3.1.1 : Elements increase in atomic number across each period, and down each group.

3.1.2 : Group - the columns proceeding vertically. Period - the rows proceeding horizontally.

3.1.3 : Group = number of valence electrons in the atom. Period = number of main electron shells...s, p , d and f blocks as described above.

===3.2 Physical Properties===

3.2.1 :
'''Electron structure'''
*As a period is crossed, valency electrons increase
*As a group is descended, a shell is added (with the same number of valency electrons)

'''Atomic radii'''
*Across a period, radii decreases due to an increasing nuclear charge and reduced screening (more electrons and protons in outer shell)
*Down a group, radii increases due to additional shells blocking nuclear charge and increased screening (shielding)

'''Ionic radii'''
*Positive ions (Na ‡ Na+ + e-) have smaller radii due to 1 less shell and reduced screening
*Negative ions (F + e- ‡ F-) have larger radii because the positive charge of the nucleus has less positive pulling power (PPP) due to the presence of an extra electron in this ionic state.
'''Ionisation energy'''
Ionisation energy is the energy required to remove 1MOLE of electrons from 1MOLE of gaseous atoms (e.g. M ‡ M+ + e-)

Successive ionisation energies are 3rd &gt; 2nd &gt; 1st, because of a smaller radii and greater charge.

'''Electron affinity'''
Electron affinity is the energy change on the addition of 1 mole of electrons to 1 mole of gaseous atoms (e.g. X(g) + e- ‡ X-(g))

'''Electronegativity'''
Electronegativity is the measure of the ability of an element in a bond to attract electrons. The most electronegative elements are (in decreasing) F, O and N. 
*Across a period, electronegativity increases because the increase in nuclear charge makes the nucleus more attracted to electrons
*Down a group, electronegativity decreases due to increased screening and less nuclear attraction

'''Melting Points'''
*Melting point decrease down group 1 due the the elements metallic structure, which is held together by attractive forces between de-localized electrons.
*Melting point increases down group 7 due to the strong intermolecular forces that increase in strength with more electrons.

== Periodic Trends - Moving Across the Periodic Table ==

Because of the way in which the periodic table is organized, many trends become apparent.

Moving across the periodic table, proton and electrons are added. Because all of these electrons are added into the same shell, the '''ionization energy''' increases. The ionization energy is the amount of energy required to remove the outermost electrons.  Because of the overall greater attraction between more protons and more electrons across the periodic table, it becomes more and more difficult to remove an electron. The '''atomic radius''' of the elements decreases. Also, '''metallic character''' decreases ('''electronegativity''' increases; electronegativity is the tendency of an element to gain electrons). This traces the tendency of atoms of metals to lose electrons while nonmetals gain them.

== Periodic Trends - Moving Down the Periodic Table ==

Because elements in the same family (column) contain the same valence shell electron configuration, they tend to behave very similarly. Moving down the periodic table, electrons are added to successively higher energy levels. Because of this, '''atomic radius''' increases. Also, it is easier to remove the outermost electron of larger atoms, so '''ionization energy''' decreases as well as '''electro negativity'''.

== Noble Gases 0/8A/18 ==

helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon 

Noble gases except helium all share a full valence shell electron configuration ( 8 outer electrons, 2 for helium). Because this configuration is extremely stable as well as symmetrical, the noble gases are very unreactive and will only react under extremely rigorous conditions.

== Halogens 7A/17 ==

fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine

Halogens have an electron configuration of 7, meaning they require only one more electron for a noble configuration. They have very negative electron affinities, are extremely reactive, and form ions with a -1 charge. They are so reactive that in their homogenous state UV light will catalyze a radical reaction. 

Fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements and is so reactive that it attacks almost any other element (noble gases, oxygen, nitrogen, and gold are the exceptions) to form fluorides. Chlorine is somewhat less reactive, bromine somewhat less reactive than chlorine, and iodine even less, but even iodine is a formidable iodizer. Strong radioactivity masks the chemical properties of astatine.

All except astatine form gaseous compounds with hydrogen: hydrogen fluoride HF, hydrogen chloride HCl, hydrogen bromide HBr, and hydrogen iodide HI; these are acidic, strongly reactive substances; except for hydrogen fluoride these substances are among the strongest known acids. They free halogens and the hydrogen halides react with most metals, halides of metals being known as salts, of which sodium chloride NaCl is best known as &quot;salt&quot;.



Electronegativity decreases in this group with increasing atomic mass, and oxygen is more electronegative than any element except fluorine; it acts much like a halogen except for its -2 oxidation state. Fluorine and oxygen oxidize these elements to the +6 oxidation state, resulting in such substances (for sulfur) as sulfur hexafluoride SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfur trioxide SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and its derivative sulfuric acid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, one of the most heavily-used industrial chemicals. Fluorine, oxygen, chlorine, and bromine oxidize all of the elements of this group except oxygen to the +4 oxidation state. 

Oxides of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are acidic. Strong radioactivity largely masks the chemical properties of polonium.

== Alkaline Earth Metals group 2A/2 ==

(beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, radium)

These substances are all metals having two electrons in the outer shell, or the ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration. With increasing mass these elements become softer, have lower melting and boiling points, and become more reactive. None appear uncombined in nature, and all are separated from their compounds with difficulty. All react with halogens and, except for beryllium, with water and oxygen (magnesium at temperatures higher than those of living things)  

All oxidize to the +2 state that represents an ion in the stable configuration of an inert gas.  

Beryllium is the least reactive; it is the hardest of these elements. Its oxide is amphoteric; it reacts with both strong acids and bases.

Magnesium burns in hot air or steam to form alkaline oxides or hydroxides. Powders or thin slices of this metal can be ignited with a match. Magnesium hydroxide is a strong base, although its low solubility masks its alkalinity. At room temperature magnesium metal is light and strong, but it can be ignited in air. Halogens and acids attack magnesium violently with the formation of salts like magnesium chloride (MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or magnesium sulfate (MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Although magnesium would react with atmospheric oxygen, an oxide layer protects the metal from oxidation. 

With calcium and the heavier elements of this group, the reactions are even more violent and take place at lower temperatures; they react not only with halogens and acids but also with water, oxygen, and even nitrogen. They are such strong reducing agents that they can reduce carbon dioxide to carbon as well as many metal oxides to metals. 

The strong radioactivity of radium masks its chemical properties, but to the extent that its chemistry is known it fits well into the group and its pattern.

== Alkali Metals group 1A/1 ==

(lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium (US spelling ''cesium''), francium)

These elements are best marked by their reactivity. Physically they are soft, shiny (when freshly prepared) solids with low melting points; they conduct electricity well. They all have one outermost electron that they lose easily to almost any electronegative substance other than nitrogen (lithium reacts with nitrogen, unlike the others). None is ever found uncombined on earth, and none is ever put to use as a structural metal. They must be kept under inert liquids such as kerosene or in inert gases (nitrogen suffices for any of these elements other than lithium. 

All oxidize easily to the +1 oxidation state.  High reactivity masks the chemistry of francium.

They react with atmospheric oxygen to form various oxides and react violently with water, halogens, and acids. A typical reaction between one of these metals and water is as such:

Na&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2 H&lt;sub&gt;2 (g)&lt;/sub&gt;

(WARNING: this reaction generates much heat. One should not cast any alkali metal into water or acids except with the cautions that professional chemists use. The hydrogen gas from this reaction may itself ignite with atmospheric oxygen in a dangerous flame. These metals should never allowed to touch flesh because they react with any water upon them and yield corrosive hydroxides that burn flesh. Strong solutions of alkali metal hydroxides are destructive to flesh).

Hydroxides of these elements dissociate completely in water to form some of the strongest bases known. These are as strongly alkaline as any acids and react violently with acids to form halides and water in neutralization:

NaOH&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl &lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; →  NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

The results of any reactions of these metals and any acids are salts. Almost all salts of these elements are highly soluble in water and form conducting solutions, proving their ionic nature. The best known of these substances is sodium chloride, NaCl, a substance known as common salt. Salts of these elements and strong acids are neutral (for example, potassium nitrate KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); salts with weak acids such as acetic acid are alkaline (sodium carbonate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Hydrogen, an element like no other ==

Hydrogen is by far the most common element in the universe; as a gas it is too light for the Earth's gravitation to hold. It is by far the most common constituent of the Sun and all other stars and of the gas giant planets of our solar system. It exists on or just under the surface of the Earth as a component of water and in innumerable compounds of carbon, many essential to life. 

The heat and light from the sun (or any other star) arises largely from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. Nuclear reactions are outside of the normal scope of the discussion of chemistry, so that can be largely ignored here. 

Hydrogen, although having one outermost electron does not fit into the alkali metals  or any other group. It deserves its own treatment. It forms compounds analogous to those of the alkali metals, but such hydrogen compounds are much less alkaline (or more acidic), much less ionic, and more volatile.  Sodium chloride, the stereotypical salt, is neutral and clearly ionic; hydrogen chloride is a non-ionic gas under normal conditions and is a strong acid. The hydrogen analogue of sodium hydroxide is a volatile liquid under normal situations: unlike the strongly alkaline and solid sodium hydroxide, water is feebly ionic and effectively neutral.

Hydrogen is a non-metal, forming a diatomic gas which results from the sharing of the single electrons of hydrogen atoms. It can achieve a stable ionic structure (no electrons!) by losing an electron or by gaining an electron and achieving the completed shell configuration of helium. The hydrogen molecule is best described as sharing the two electrons between two hydrogen atoms. This structure is highly stable and has little inclination to form bonds between other hydrogen molecules; hydrogen is a gas down to some of the lowest temperatures known. It is also the lightest of gases, weighing less even than helium.

Hydrogen readily shares its electron with a strongly-electronegative element like any halogen, oxygen, or sulfur. The combination with fluorine is particularly violent and possible down to very low temperatures: 

1/2 H&lt;sub&gt;2 (g) &lt;/sub &gt; + 1/2 F&lt;sub&gt;2(g) &lt;/sub&gt; → HF&lt;sub&gt;(g) &lt;/sub&gt;

Light is enough to force combustion between hydrogen and chlorine, and a spark is enough to cause combustion between hydrogen and oxygen. In view of the ''Hindenburg'' disaster of 1936, helium has long replaced hydrogen in lighter-than-air aircraft. That reaction is as such:

H&lt;sub&gt;2 (g) &lt;/sub&gt; + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2 (g) &lt;/sub&gt;  → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;sub&gt; (g)&lt;/sub&gt;

(Note that at the temperatures associated with such a combustion, water is in the gaseous state!)

Somewhat analogously (but not very well), hydrogen can act somewhat like a halogen, forming hydrides with some metals. Most of these react violently with water to form hydrogen gas and the metal hydroxide. Hydrogen compounds with non-metals are typically among the most volatile substances of those elements.  

Under pressure, in aqueous solution or non-solid acids, hydrogen is a good reducing agent. Strong acids attack most metals: 

Zn&lt;sub&gt; (s)&lt;/sub&gt;  + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sup&gt; → Zn &lt;sup&gt; 2+ &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq) &lt;/sub&gt;  + H &lt;sub&gt;  2 (g) &lt;/sub&gt;.

In the atmospheres of gas giants, gaseous hydrogen under great pressure reduces nitrogen to ammonia, carbon compounds to methane and other hydrocarbons, and oxides to water. 
  
'''Hydrogen forms more chemical compounds than any other element''' including carbon (almost all carbon compounds are compounds of hydrogen as well and vice-versa, but more substances containing hydrogen but not carbon exist than do compounds of carbon but not hydrogen). Hydrogen forms bonds with most non-metals, including oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Although a hydrogen atom can bond with only one other element, and then only in a single bond, hydrogen allows very long chains of carbon atoms to form.  Most of the hydrogen compounds with carbon alone are combustible gases or volatile liquids or waxy solids that can be vaporized and burned to produce water, carbon dioxide, and much heat. Natural gas, gasoline (a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons), and waxes as found in candles make suitable fuels. With such other elements as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and in some cases metals hydrogen allows the formation of substances necessary for life, including carboxylic acids, sugars, proteins, nucleic acids, hemoglobin, and chlorophyll. 

Such complex compounds are ordinarily discussed in organic chemistry, a study associated more obviously with carbon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Bonding==
Put simply, '''chemical bonding''' joins atoms together to form more complex structures (like molecules or crystals). Bonding can occur between atoms of the same element, or between atoms of different elements. There are several types of chemical bonding which have different properties and give rise to different structures.

'''[[General Chemistry/Ionic bonding|Ionic bonding]]''' occurs between positive and negative ions (charged atoms). This type of bonding seldom occurs between just two atoms, but typically leads to the formation of an ionic solid, in which the ions arrange themselves into a rigid crystal lattice. NaCl (common salt) is an example of an ionic substance. 

'''[[General Chemistry/Covalent bonds|Covalent bonding]]''' occurs when atoms share electrons with each other. This gives rise to two types of structures: molecules and covalent network solids. Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a covalent molecule and glass is a covalent network solid. In molecules we can distinguish individual covalent bonds between pairs of atoms.

Whether the interaction between two atoms has a covalent or ionic character can be predicted from the atoms' electronegativities:

{|
!Type of bond
!Difference in atoms' electronegativities
!Example
|-
|Non-polar covalent bond:
|0.0-0.4
|F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|Slightly polar bond: 
|0.5-0.9
|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|Moderately polar bond: 
|1-1.3
|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|Highly polar bond: 
|1.4-1.7
|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|Slightly ionic bond: 
|1.8-2.2
|NaCl, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|Ionic Bond: 
|2.3+
|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CsF
|}


'''[[General Chemistry/Metallic bonds|Metallic bonding]]''' occur between metal atoms. In a metallically bonded substance, the atoms' outer electrons are able to freely move around - they are delocalised. In principle, all electrons can behave like delocalized waves, but in substances with covalent or ionic bonding the number of accessible energy states equals the number of electrons and that makes this wave character less apparent. In metals there are far more accessible states than electrons and that leaves the electrons free to move and conduct electrically. Aluminum, tin, lead, silver are all metallically bonded elements, but there are also compounds with metallic bonding, such as alloys and intermetallic compounds.

Chemical bonding is one of the most crucial concepts in the study of Chemistry. In fact, the properties of materials are basically defined by the type and number of atoms they contain and how they are bonded together.

== 4.1 Ionic Bonding ==

4.1.1 : Ionic bonding - +ve (cations) and -ve (anions) ions are attracted to each other and form a continuous ionic lattice.

=== What are ions? ===
'''Ions''' are atoms or molecules which are electrically charged. '''Cations''' are positively charged and '''anions''' carry a negative charge. Ions form when atoms gain or lose electrons. Since electrons are negatively charged, an atom that loses an electron will become positively charged (similarly an atom that gains one or more electrons becomes negatively charged).

=== Description of Ionic Bonding ===
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negatively  charged '''ions'''. These oppositely charged ions attract each other and remain close together - they become ionically bonded. The ''law of electrostatic'' explains why this happens: opposite charges attract and like charges repel. When many ions attract each other, they form into large, orderly crystal lattices in which each ion is surrounded by ions of the opposite charge. When a metal forms an ionic bond with a non-metal, electrons are transferred from metal element to non-metal. When Ions are formed it is called ''Ionization''

=== Formation ===
[[File:NaCl_ionic.png|thumb|The electron transfer from Na to Cl leading to the formation of ions.]]
Ionic bonding result when metals and non-metals chemically react. Due to its low ionization energy, a metal atom is destabilized only a little if it loses electrons to form a complete valence shell and becomes positively charged. Likewise, a non-metal is stabilized strongly by gaining  electrons to complete its valence shell and become negatively charged. When a metal and a non-metal come into contact, the metal loses electrons by transferring them to the non-metal, which gains them. Consequently, ions are formed, which instantly attract each other. The process typically does not stop with two ions, but proceeds to involve a great many of them that stack in a solid lattice, in which individual 'bonds' or individual molecules cannot be distinguished. 


4.1.2 : Group 1 metals form +1 ions, group 2 metals form +2 ions, metals in group 3 form +3 ions. Examples : Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;...Greater ease of ionisation Li-&gt;Cs is due to the increased electron shielding of the nuclear attraction caused by additional inner shells of electrons. The easier atoms are to ionise, the more reactive they will be because less energy is required to ionise them, and so they react more easily.

4.1.3 : Group 6 ions will form 2- ions, Group 7 ions will form 1- ions. Examples : O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;...

4.1.4 : The transitions metals (elements from Ti to Cu, ignore Sc and Zn) can form multiple ions (ie Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) (due to proximity of 4s and 3d shells)

4.1.5 : The ionic or covalent nature of the bonding in a binary compound is a result in the difference between their electronegativity...NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; is ionic, HCl&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; is (polar) covalent (also, covalent molecules tend to be gases/liquids, ionic tends to be solid...except network covalent which will be solid). In general, if the difference between electronegativities is greater than 1.7, the bond will be more than 50% ionic.

4.1.6 : Take the name of the group 1,2, or 3 metal and add...fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide etc , oxide, sulfide, nitride or phosphide...

== 4.2 Covalent Bond ==

One useful model of covalent bonding is called the ''Valence Bond'' model. It states that covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons with each other in order to complete their valence (outer) electron shells. They are mainly formed between non-metals (i.e. chlorine, sulfur, carbon etc.). 

=== The Valence Bond Model ===
An example of a covalently bonded substance is hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A hydrogen atom on its own has one electron – there is room for two to complete its valence shell. When two hydrogen atoms bond, each one shares its electron with the other, i.e. the electrons are attracted by two nuclei instead of just one and so releasing energy. Both atoms now have access to two electrons: they become a stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule joined by a '''single covalent bond'''.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Covalent_bond_h.png|Diagram of a covalent bond between hydrogen atoms]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== Double and Triple Bonds ===
Covalent bonds can also form between other non-metals, for example chlorine. A chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its valence shell — it needs 8 to complete it. Two chlorine atoms can share 1 electron each to form a single covalent bond. They become a Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.

Oxygen can also form covalent bonds; however, it needs a further 2 electrons to complete its valence shell (it has 6). Two oxygen atoms must share 2 electrons each to complete each other's shells, making a total of 4 shared electrons. Because twice as many electrons are shared, this is called a '''double covalent bond'''.

Furthermore, nitrogen has 5 valence electrons (it needs a further 3). Two nitrogen atoms can share 3 electrons each (6 in total) to make a N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule joined by a '''triple covalent bond'''.

=== Electron Sharing and Orbitals ===
Carbon, contrary to the trend, does not share four electrons to make a quadruple bond. The reason for this is that the fourth pair of electrons in carbon cannot physically move close enough to be shared. The valence bond model explains this by considering the '''orbitals''' involved. Also more energy can be released by making 4 single bonds to 4 other carbon atoms to form a '''diamond''' structure. 

Recall that electrons exist as clouds of electron density (orbitals) in atoms. The valence bond model works on the principle that orbitals on different atoms must '''overlap''' to form a bond. There are several different ways that the orbitals can overlap, forming several distinct kinds of covalent bonds.

=== The Sigma Bond ===
The first, and simplest kind of overlap is when two s orbitals come together. It is called a '''sigma''' bond (sigma, or 'σ', is the greek equivalent of 's'). Sigma bonds can also form between two p orbitals that lie pointing towards each other.

''picture of sigma bonds- please press the no.1''[http://burgaz.mit.edu/RESEARCHTOPICS/IMG/Fe O sigma bond.jpg]

=== The Pi Bond ===
The second, and equally important kind of overlap is between two parallel p orbitals. Instead of overlapping, head-to-head (as in the sigma bond), they join side-to-side, forming two areas of electron density above and below the molecule(delocalization). This type of overlap is referred to as a '''pi''' ('π', from the greek equivalent of p) bond.

4.2.1 : Covalent bonds are where two atoms each donate 1 electron to form a pair held between the two atoms...Such bonds are generally formed by atoms with little difference in electronegativity...ie C, H and O in organic chemistry.

4.2.2 : All electrons must be paired...Lewis diagrams are the element symbol with the outer (valence) shell of electrons left over and spare electrons pair up...in general C forms 4 bonds, N forms 3, O forms 2, halogens form 1, H forms 1...(Li would form 1, Be 2, and B 3 but they don't usually...metallic or ionic bonding)

4.2.3 : Electronegativity values range from 0.7 to 4...from bottom left to top right respectively (hydrogen falls B and C with a electronegativity of 2.1...

4.2.4 : When covalent molecules have a difference in electronegativity (between the two bonding atoms) then the pair will be held closer to the more electronegative atom...resulting in a small -ve charge on the more electronegative atom, and a small +ve charge on the other...results in polar bonds

4.2.5 : Shape of molecule with 4 electron pairs depends on number of lone pairs.

3 lone pairs -&gt; linear, 2 lone pairs -&gt; bent, 1 lone pair -&gt; trigonal pyramid, No lone pairs -&gt; tetrahedral

4.2.6 : The polarity of a molecule depends on both the shape and the polarity of the bonds...1) if there are no polar bonds, it's not polar. 2) if there are polar bonds, but the shape is symmetrical, it's not polar (think about it like 3D vector addition...if they add to zero, then it's not polar). 3) if there are polar bonds, and it's not symmetric, then the molecule is polar

== 4.3 Intermolecular forces ==

4.3.1 : van der Waal's forces -- Electrons will not be evenly spread around an atom/molecule at any given time, meaning the molecule will have a slight postitive charge on one end, and a negative at the other. This temporary state may cause attraction between two molecules, pulling them together (also known as London Dispersion Forces). Polar molecules, when properly oriented, will attract each other as a result of Dipole-Dipole forces. Dipole-Dipole forces are stronger than van der Waal's forces. Hydrogen bonding is when hydrogen is bonded to nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine, and a very strong dipole is formed, making the hydrogen very strongly positive. This hydrogen is then attracted to the lone pairs on other similar molecules--nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine all have lone pairs--forming a hydrogen bond, which is stronger than van der Waal's or dipole-dipole forces, but weaker than covalent bonding.

4.3.2 : Structural features -- Nonpolar molecules have van der Waal's forces only. This is also present in all other molecules, though its strength is often insignificant compared to the others. Polar molecules have dipole-dipole forces, which arise from polar bonds and asymmetry in molecules. Hydrogen bonds result from strongly delta positive hydrogen. This results in molecules with hydrogen bonding exhibiting stronger intermolecular forces, i.e. higher boiling/melting points etc. For example, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O has a higher bp then H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S due to hydrogen bonding. Neutral molecules don't conduct electricity but some polar molecules exchange protons to form ions e.g. 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O makes H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

== 4.4 Metallic bonding ==

4.4.1 : The metal atoms lose their outer electrons which then become delocalized, and free to move throughout the entire metal. These -ve delocalized electrons hold the metal cations together strongly. Since these electrons can flow, atoms with metallic bonding exhibit high electrical conductivity. The number of valence electrons involved in the bonding and the strength of the nucleus charge determines the strength.
Unlike ionic bonding, distorting the atoms does not cause repulsion so metallic substances are ductile (can be stretched into wires) and malleable (can be made into flat sheets). The free moving electrons also allow for high thermal conductivity, and the electrons can carry the heat energy rather than it being transferred slowly through atoms vibrating.

Metallic bonds occur among metal atoms. A sea of valence electrons surrounds positive metal ions. The electrons are free to move throughout the resulting crystal. The delocalized nature of the electrons explains a number of unique characteristics of metals: they are good conductors of electricity, they are ductile, meaning they can be made into wires, and they are malleable, meaning they can easily be hammered into thin sheets.

== 4.5 Physical Properties ==

Melting and Boiling point: High with Ionic, Metallic Bonding and Network Covalent.
Low with Covalent Molecular Bonding.

Volatility: Covalent Molecular Substances are volatile, others are not.

Conductivity: Metallic substances conduct. Polar molecular substances conduct, non-polar ones don't. Ionic substances do conduct when molten or dissolved in water but never when solid.

Solubility: Ionic substances --&gt; generally dissolve in polar solvents (like water).
Metallic substances --&gt; soluble in liquid metal.
Non-polar molecules are generally soluble in non-polar solvents, and polar in polar.
Organic molecules with a polar head --&gt; Short chain molecules are solubility in polar solvents but long chains can eventually outweigh the polar 'head' and will dissolve in non-polar solvents.

=== Characteristics ===
&lt;math&gt;NaCl&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;KNO_3&lt;/math&gt;

Ionically bonded substances typically have the following characteristics.

* High melting point (solid at room temp)
* Hard
* Brittle (can shatter)
* Some dissolve in water
* Conduct electricity when dissolved or melted
* Typically stronger than covalent bonds.

== 5.1 States of matter ==

=== 5.1.1 Solids ===
In a solid-state molecules/atoms are tightly packed. The force of attraction between molecules/atoms overcomes any translational motion of molecules (they do, however, vibrate in position). 

=== 5.1.2 Liquids ===
Liquids are particles that are held close together, but not as strongly as solids in that they are free to move, but not to escape the liquid (except for fast traveling particles -&gt; evaporation).

=== 5.1.3 Gas ===
Gas consists of particles that can move independently and randomly, with no significant forces between particles, and a large (comparatively) amount of space between them.
An ideal gas is composed of randomly moving point masses occupying no space and with no forces between masses. The average (rms) speed of the movement of particles is proportional to temperature (in K). As a result, the kinetic energy of the particles is also proportional to temperature.

=== 5.1.4 Transitions === 
Solid into liquid , the rigid structure of the solid is overcome due to increased vibration of particles (due to energy being added in the form of heat). The particles cannot escape from the liquid, but can move within it (thus dissolving in it). 
Liquid to gas, as energy (in the form of heat) is given to the liquid, the particles gain enough energy to escape the liquid, and become a gas, with particles widely spaced gas can take tremendous volumes. 
Gas into liquid, as heat (energy) is removed, the particles slow down to the point where the forces between particles are strong enough to hold them together, a liquid is formed!
Liquid into solid, even more energy is removed and particles move slower. Stronger forces build a more rigid structure for the material.

=== 5.1.5 Increasing the temperature ===
Causes the material to become larger in volume or higher pressure.
An increase in volume (which holds the material) will translate itself in a decrease in temperature or a decrease in pressure. An increase in pressure(on the other hand) will cause a decrease in volume or increase in temperature.

=== 5.1.6 Diffusion ===
Since the particles are moving at random (here: in a gas), two separated samples of gas will eventually mix causing diffusion. This will occur at a higher rate with higher temperature since the particles are moving faster.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]

==Ingredients==
===Pie Crust===
*8 oz (225 g) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*4 oz (110 g) [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*2 oz (55 g) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 tablespoons cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

===Pie Filling===
*1 lb (500 g) [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], sliced
*2 tbsp [[cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 oz (28 g) salted [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
*2&amp;frac12; c [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]], and additional for sprinkling
*&amp;frac14; c [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
*2&amp;frac12; tbsp [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*[[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

===Pie Topping===
*1 oz (28 g) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*[[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*[[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
===Pie Crust===
#Rub flour, margarine, lard, and salt together until the mixture has the consistency of fine breadcrumbs.
#Add 2 tablespoons water to make a soft but firm dough.
#Roll pastry on floured surface to the size you want your pie. Make two crusts.
#Place one crust in pie pan.

===Pie Filling===
:''Do not precook apples, as this will deprive the pie of a substantial amount of flavor and turns the apples into mush!''

#Peel and slice apples into 1/8th-1/4th inch (about 50 mm) thick segments.
#Add lemon juice to apples.
#Mix apples by hand with 1/2 cup sugar and a few dashes of cinnamon. 
#Transfer segments, minus their acquired juices, to pie pan. (Omitting the expressed juice will help prevent the pie from boiling over in the oven.) 
#Mix the rest of the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, flour, and cornstarch in a separate bowl.
#Pour this over the apples in pie pan.
#Dot with butter.
#Cover with the other crust.
#Firm down edges with fork or finger.
#Cut heart or diamond-shaped vents into top crust.
#Brush the pastry top with milk and sprinkle additional sugar and cinnamon over the top.
#[[cookbook:Bake|Bake]] at 350 °F (180 °C) until golden brown (about 60 minutes.)
#Take the pie out of the oven and let it cool slightly on the counter.  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT try to eat it right out of the oven, as it will be very hot and this can cause burns!
#Serve warm with ice cream or custard.

==Gielinor Method==
'''&lt;big&gt;Requires level 30 cooking.&lt;/big&gt;'''
:Get a hold of all the ingredients in the cooking guild:
*A pie dish
*An apple
*Wheat
*Pot
*Bucket

#Pick the wheat just outside of the cooking guild and head up to the top floor of the guild.
#Use the wheat on the hopper and pull the lever nearby. Head downstairs and fill the pot with flour from the flour bin.
#Use the bucket on the sink in the guild to fill it with water and combine the flour with the water to make a pie dough.
#Use the pie dough on the pie dish to get a pie crust.
#Pick up an apple from the table on the top floor and use it with the pie crust to make an uncooked apple pie.
#Use the uncooked apple pie on the stove to cook it. Lower cooking levels can lead to a higher chance of burning the pie.
*TIP: If you have a low cooking level you can take all of your uncooked pies to the Lumbridge castle stove where there is a lower chance of burning your pies as long as you have done the 'Cook's assistant' quest.
*Once you're done you can proceed to eat the pie, bank it or sell it on the Grand Exchange.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Use a variety of apples to get more complex flavors and textures.
*Use 2-3 Granny Smith apples, in combination with the other apples.
*Replace the lard with shortening for a vegan dessert.

==Warnings==
*Filling will be '''&lt;big&gt;EXTREMELY&lt;/big&gt;''' hot immediately after the pie is taken from the oven, so let it cool slightly before you eat it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a recipe that my Mother gave me and was always used in my family. Sadly she passed away on 30 may 2003.  She would have been so proud if she could have seen it.

Why was the margarine doubled? I think somebody messed up the recipe, but I'm not about to bake 2 pies to verify this.

* I use something inbetween: 2 parts flour, 1 part fat.

== Simmering ==

The original recipe had the apples simmered in 3 tablespoons of water. First I don't know how that could be done (but I'm a novice), but second it has been removed and apples are raw in the current recipe. But still the 3 tablespoons of hot water have remained in the ingredients section. We should remove the hot water if it is not needed to avoid confusing such laymen as me :). --[[User:89.133.3.110|89.133.3.110]] 12:53, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

== alton brown is awesome ==

this recipe is for cobbler not pie because he didnt let it sit for 4 hours whoever wrote this should watch the apple pie episode of good eats hail alton brown he is awesome

== Merging articles? ==

Is it sane to consider merging the multiple recipes as [[Cookbook:Policy#Duplicate_Recipes_and_Disambiguation_Pages|variations on]] the [[Cookbook:Apple Pie I|Apple Pie I]] recipe? It's frustrating to have multiple, unintuitively-named pages for these things. --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 17:56, 12 December 2013 (UTC)</text>

I have tried to add a little to this page, and have also removed the section with &quot;at home&quot; and replaced it with the mare part. I believe that, considering the somewhat archaic use of the locative to say the same, as well as the irregular nature of the word domo, it is probably best not to use the word. Sorry if I've messed up the lesson here!
-Asv, March 29th 





This has been a great course so far, but I think that this lesson needs a lot of work. There's a whole lot of information that gets dumped on the learner. I think it could be broken up into several different lessons. It also needs a lot more excercises at the end (the whole course could benefit from more excercises, but this lesson really needs it). Finally, the vocative case has been added to the declension charts, but there has been no teaching about it. Thank you for putting your time and effort into this project. :)

OK. I am the primary maintainer for this page. I am annoyed that my good explanation of the ablative, one that I've used and applied many times has been summarily removed. Be curteous, and explain yourself on the talk page.

In preparation for finals, I have made a very basic change: put nominative and genitive next to one another.

My textbook and many other students use the order in the declension tables: (for nouns): nom-gen.-dat.-acc.-abl.

If we are using a different order, we should justify it--and I'm not saying there aren't justifications.

I think the ordering of the cases should be switched to the conventional styled used in most books and webpages. The current presentation is a bit confusing. --[[User:24.147.68.116|24.147.68.116]] 22:20, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

== order of cases ==

While the Nom-Gen-Dat-Acc-Abl is the most common order for cases, it is probably the least natural or logical.

Nom and Acc should be next to each other, as should Dat and Abl, because of the similarities in the declensions in those cases.  Where to put Gen is less obvious, but I prefer after Acc (probably due to my english language bias).  GCSE latin is one system which uses this order.

In fact, the other way annoys me so much, I think I'll fix it now, since the page is inconsistent as it currently stands.  (sharkey)

== Vocabulary? ==

How are we supposed to know what we are asked to translate? I mean, there's pronouns in these, and we didn't even cover them yet! What are we supposed to do, guess?

(10th grade)

Good work so far, but I think this lesson needs ''a lot'' of work.  Firstly, the opening explanation of the ablative case is cryptic and incomprehensible.  There has also been no mention of anything Greek until this point.  In the following examples, there is also an utter lack of actual examples in Latin.  The vocabulary used is also unexplained (ad, agris, campus).  The &quot;excercize&quot; (''How would you translate: I form the picture by means of weaving...'') also gives no explanation and no answer whatsoever; it's not a very good way to clarify things.


For the pronouns I, you, he, she, it, we, and they, they are not needed for a verb of that pronoun's specific person has that pronoun included automaticly in translation.&lt;br /&gt;
I.E. eum exanimaverunt  &lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; weakened him.(eum)

== This lesson moves to fast ==

For people who are just now starting Latin, this lesson moves to fast.  It also poorly defines the Abl. case.  There is also a lack of vocabulary needed to complete the exersices.  Can someone fix this?</text>

A '''figure of syntax''' is an intentional deviation from the ordinary construction of words. The principal figures of syntax are five; namely, el-lip'-sis, ple'-o-nasm, syl-lep'-sis, en-al'-la-ge, and hy-per'-ba-ton.

==Ellipsis==
Ellipsis is the omission of some word or words which are necessary to complete the construction, but not necessary to convey the meaning. Such words are said, in technical phrase, to be understood.

Of compound sentences, a vast many are more or less elliptical. Sometimes, for brevity's sake, even the most essential parts of a simple sentence, are suppressed: as,

*&quot;But more of this hereafter.&quot;&amp;mdash;Harris's Hermes, p. 77.
*This means, &quot;But I shall say more of this hereafter.&quot;
*&quot;Prythee, peace.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*That is, &quot;I pray you, hold you your peace.&quot;

There may be an omission of any of the parts of speech, or even of a whole clause, when this repeats what precedes. But the omission of mere articles or interjections can scarcely constitute a proper ellipsis, because these parts of speech ought to be expressed.

===Of the article===

*&quot;A man and [a] woman.&quot;
*&quot;The day, [the] month, and [the] year.&quot;
*&quot;She gave me an apple and [a] pear, for a fig and [an] orange.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jaudon's Gram., p. 170.

===Of the noun===

*&quot;The common [law] and the statute law.&quot;
*&quot;The twelve [apostles].&quot;
*&quot;The same [man] is he.&quot;
*&quot;One [book] of my books.&quot;
*&quot;A dozen [bottles] of wine.&quot;
*&quot;Conscience, I say; not your own [conscience], but [the conscience] of the other.&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Cor., x, 29.
*&quot;Every moment subtracts from [our lives] what it adds to our lives.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn's Ref., p. 8.
*&quot;Bad actions mostly lead to worse&quot; [actions].&amp;mdash;Ib., p. 5.

===Of the adjective===

*&quot;There are subjects proper for the one, and not [proper] for the other.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames.
*&quot;A just weight and [a just] balance are the Lord's.&quot;&amp;mdash;Prov., xvi, 11.

True ellipses of the adjective alone, are but seldom met with.

===Of the pronoun===

*&quot;Leave [you] there your gift before the altar, and go [you] your way; first be [you] reconciled to your brother, and then come [you] and offer [you] your gift,&quot;&amp;mdash;Matt., v, 24.
*&quot;Love [you] your enemies, bless [you] them that curse you, do [you] good to them that hate you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., v. 44.
*&quot;Chastisement does not always immediately follow error, but [it] sometimes comes when [it is] least expected.&quot;&amp;mdash; Dillwyn, Ref., p. 31.
*&quot;Men generally put a greater value upon the favours [which] they bestow, than upon those [which] they receive.&quot;&amp;mdash;Art of Thinking, p. 48.
*&quot;Wisdom and worth were all [that] he had.&quot;&amp;mdash;Allen's Gram., p. 294.

===Of the verb===

*&quot;The world is crucified to me, and I [am crucified] to the world.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gal., vi, 14.
*&quot;Hearts should not [differ], though heads may, differ.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn, p. 11.
*&quot;Are you not much better than they&quot; [are]?&amp;mdash;Matt., vi, 26.
*&quot;Tribulation works patience; and patience [works] experience; and experience [works] hope.&quot;&amp;mdash;Romans, v, 4.
*&quot;Wrongs are engraved on marble; benefits [are engraved] on sand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Art of Thinking, p. 41.
*&quot;To whom thus Eve, yet sinless&quot; [spoke].&amp;mdash;Milton.

===Of the participle===

*&quot;That [being] over, they part.&quot;
*&quot;Animals of various natures, some adapted to the wood, and some [adapted] to the wave.&quot;&amp;mdash;Melmoth, on Scripture, p. 13.
*&quot;His knowledge [being] measured to his state and place, His time [being] a moment, and a point [being] his space.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Of the adverb===

*&quot;He can do this independently of me, if not [independently] of you.&quot;
*&quot;She shows a body rather than a life; a statue, [rather] than a breather.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak., Ant. and Cleo., iii, 3.

===Of the conjunction===

*&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, [and] joy, [and] peace, [and] long suffering, [and] gentleness, [and] goodness, [and] faith, [and] meekness, [and] temperance.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gal., v, 22.

The repetition of the conjunction is called polysyndeton; and the omission of it, asyndeton.

===Of the preposition===

*&quot;It shall be done [on] this very day.&quot;
*&quot;We shall set off [at] some time [in] next month.&quot;
*&quot;He departed [from] this life.&quot;
*&quot;He gave [to] me a book.&quot;
*&quot;We walked [through] a mile.&quot;
*&quot;He was banished [from] the kingdom.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen.
*&quot;He lived like [to] a prince.&quot;&amp;mdash;Wells.

===Of the interjection===

*&quot;Oh! the frailty, [oh!] the wickedness of men.&quot;
*&quot;Alas for Mexico! and [alas] for many of her invaders!&quot;

===Of phrases or clauses===

*&quot;The active commonly do more than they are bound to do; the indolent [commonly do] less&quot; [than they are bound to do].
*&quot;Young men, angry, mean less than they say; old men, [angry, mean] more&quot; [than they say].
*&quot;It is the duty of justice, not to injure men; [it is the duty] of modesty, not to offend them.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen.

==Pleonasm==

Pleonasm is the introduction of superfluous words: as,

*&quot;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gen., ii, 17.

This figure is allowable only, when it abruptly introduces an emphatic word, or repeats an idea to impress it more strongly: as,

*&quot;He that has ears to hear, let him hear.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;I know you who you are.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.

A pleonasm is sometimes impressive and elegant; but an unemphatic repetition of the same idea, is one of the worst faults of bad writing.

==Syllepsis==

Syllepsis is agreement formed according to the figurative sense of a word, or the mental conception of the thing spoken of, and not according to the literal or common use of the term: as,

*&quot;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us, and we beheld his glory.&quot;&amp;mdash;John, i, 14.
*&quot;Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, viii, 5.
*&quot;The city of London have expressed their sentiments with freedom and firmness.&quot;&amp;mdash;Junius, p. 159.
*&quot;And I said [to backsliding Israel,] after she had done all these things, turn you to me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jer., iii, 7.
*&quot;And he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder.&quot;&amp;mdash;Mark, iii, 17.
*&quot;While Evening draws her crimson curtains round.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson, p. 63.
*&quot;The Thunder raises his tremendous voice.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id., p. 113.

==Enallage==

Enallage is the use of one part of speech, or of one modification, for another. This figure borders closely on solecism. There are, however, several forms of it which can appeal to good authority: as,

*&quot;You know that you are Brutus, that say this.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;They fall successive[ly], and successive[ly] rise.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.
*&quot;Than whom [who] a fiend more fell is nowhere found.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.
*&quot;Sure some disaster has befell&quot; [befallen].&amp;mdash;Gay.
*&quot;So furious was that onset's shock, destruction's gates at once unlock&quot; [unlocked].&amp;mdash;Hogg.

==Hyperbaton==

Hyperbaton is the transposition of words: as,

*&quot;He wanders earth around.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper
*&quot;Rings the world with the vain stir.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I to you.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, xvii, 23.
*&quot;'Happy', says Montesquieu, 'is that nation whose annals are tiresome.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Corwin, in Congress, 1847.

This figure is much employed in poetry, but care should be taken lest it produce ambiguity or solecism.

'''Punctuation''' is the art of dividing literary composition, by points, or stops, for the purpose of showing more clearly the sense and relation of the words; and of noting the different pauses and inflections required in reading.

The following are the principal points, or marks:

*the '''Comma''' [''','''],
*the '''Semicolon''' [''';'''],
*the '''Colon''' [''':'''],
*the '''Period''', or '''Full stop''' ['''.'''],
*the '''Dash''' ['''--'''],
*the '''Note of Interrogation''', '''Question Mark''', or '''Eroteme''' ['''?'''],
*the '''Note of Exclamation''', '''Exclamation Mark''', or '''Ecphoneme''' ['''!'''],
*the '''Marks of Parenthesis''', '''Brackets''' or '''Curves''' ['''( )'''],
*the '''Apostrophe''' ['],
*the '''Hyphen''' ['''-'''],
*the '''Diaeresis''' ['''¨'''],
*the '''Acute accent''' ['''´'''],
*the '''Grave accent''' ['''`'''],
*the '''Circumflex''' ['''ˆ'''],
*the '''Breve''' ['''˘'''],
*the '''Macron''' ['''¯'''],
*the '''Ellipsis''' ['''…'''],
*the '''Caret''' ['''^'''],
*the '''Tilde''' ['''~'''],
*the '''Curly Brackets''', or '''Brace''' ['''{}'''],
*the '''Section''' ['''§'''],
*the '''Paragraph''' ['''¶'''],
*the '''Quotation Marks''' ['''&quot;&quot;'''],
*the '''Angle Quotes''', or '''Guillements''' ['''«»'''],
*the '''Brackets''', or '''Crotchets''' ['''[]'''],
*the '''Index''' ['''☞'''],
*the '''Asterisk''' ['''*'''],
*the '''Dagger''', or '''Obelisk''' ['''†'''],
*the '''Double Dagger''', or '''Diesis''' ['''‡'''],
*the '''Parallels''' ['''||'''],
*the '''Asterism''' ['''⁂'''],
*the '''Cedilla''' ['''¸'''].

The comma denotes the shortest pause; the semicolon, a pause double that of the comma; the colon, a pause double that of the semicolon; and the period, or full stop, a pause double that of the colon. The pauses required by the other four, vary according to the structure of the sentence, and their place in it. They may be equal to any of the foregoing.


==Comma==
The comma is used to separate those parts of a sentence, which are so nearly connected in sense, as to be only one degree removed from that close connection which admits no point.

===Simple sentences===

A '''simple sentence''' does not, in general, admit the comma: as,

*&quot;The weakest reasoners are the most positive.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen's Gram., p. 202.
*&quot;Theology has not hesitated to make or support a doctrine by the position of a comma.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tract on Tone, p. 4.
*&quot;Then pain compels the impatient soul to seize on promised hopes of instantaneous ease.&quot;&amp;mdash;Crabbe.

===Nominative accompanied by adjuncts===

When the '''nominative''' in a long simple sentence is accompanied by inseparable '''adjuncts''', or when several words together are used instead of a nominative, a comma should be placed immediately before the verb: as,

*&quot;Confession of sin without amendment, obtains no pardon.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn's Reflections, p. 6.
*&quot;To be totally indifferent to praise or censure, is a real defect in character.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 268.
*&quot;O that the tenor of my just complaint, were sculpt with steel in rocks of adamant!&quot;&amp;mdash;Sandys.

===Simple members===

The '''simple members''' of a compound sentence, whether successive or involved, elliptical or complete, are generally divided by the comma: as,

*&quot;Here stand we both, and aim we at the best.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;I, that did never weep, now melt in woe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;I am their mother, who shall bar me from them?&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;How wretched, were I mortal, were my state!&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.
*&quot;Go; while you may, avoid the dreadful fate.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Grief aids disease, remembered folly stings, and his last sighs reproach the faith of kings.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.

===Relative that follows its antecedent===

When a relative immediately follows its antecedent, and is taken in a restrictive sense, the comma should not be introduced before it: as,

*&quot;For the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&quot;&amp;mdash;2 Cor., iv, 18.
*&quot;A letter is a character that expresses a sound without any meaning.&quot;&amp;mdash;St. Quentin's General Gram., p. 3.

===Closely connected simple members===

When the simple members are short, and '''closely connected''' by a '''conjunction''' or a '''conjunctive adverb''', the comma is generally omitted: as,

*&quot;Honest poverty is better than wealthy fraud.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn's Ref., p. 11.
*&quot;Let him tell me whether the number of the stars be even or odd.&quot;&amp;mdash;Taylor: Joh. Dict., w.
*&quot;It is impossible that our knowledge of words should outstrip our knowledge of things.&quot;&amp;mdash;Campbell: Murray's Gram., p 359.

===Simple immediately united members===

When two simple members are immediately united, through '''ellipsis''' of the relative, the antecedent, or the conjunction that, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;Make an experiment on the first man you meet.&quot;&amp;mdash;Berkley's Alciphron, p. 125.
*&quot;Our philosophers do infinitely despise and pity whoever shall propose or accept any other motive to virtue.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p.  126.
*&quot;It is certain we imagine before we reflect.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p. 359.
*&quot;The same good sense that makes a man excel, still makes him doubt he never has written well.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

===More than two words===

When more than two words or terms are connected in the same construction, or in a '''joint dependence''' on some other term, by conjunctions expressed or understood, the comma should be inserted after every one of them but the last; and, if they are nominatives before a verb, the comma should follow the last also: as,

*&quot;Who, to the enraptured heart, and ear, and eye, teach beauty, virtue, truth, and love, and melody.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.
*&quot;Ah! what avails... all that art, fortune, enterprise, can bring, if envy, scorn, remorse, or pride, the bosom wring?&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible; you, stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;She plans, provides, expatiates, triumphs there.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;So eagerly the fiend over bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, with head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, and swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

===Only two words===

When only two words or terms are connected by a conjunction, they should not be separated by the comma: as,

*&quot;It is a stupid and barbarous way to extend dominion by arms; for true power is to be got by arts and industry&quot;&amp;mdash;Spectator, No. 2.
*&quot;Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul.&quot;&amp;mdash;Goldsmith.

===Two words with several adjuncts===

When the '''two words''' connected have several '''adjuncts''', or when one of them has an adjunct that relates not to both, the comma is inserted: as,

*&quot;I shall spare no pains to make their instruction agreeable, and their diversion useful.&quot;&amp;mdash;Spectator, No. 10.
*&quot;Who is applied to persons, or things personified.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bullions.
*&quot;With listless eyes the dotard views the store, he views, and wonders that they please no more.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.

===Contrasted words or phrases===

When two connected words or phrases are '''contrasted''', or emphatically distinguished, the comma is inserted: as,

*&quot;The vain are easily obliged, and easily disobliged.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames.
*&quot;Liberal, not lavish, is kind nature's hand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.
*&quot;It is certain he could write, and cipher too.&quot;&amp;mdash;Goldsmith.

===Alternative of names===

When there is merely an alternative of names, or an explanatory change of terms, the comma is usually inserted: as,

*&quot;We saw a large opening, or inlet.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen.
*&quot;Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cor., ix, 5.

===Understood conjunction===

When the conjunction is understood, the comma is inserted; and, if two separated words or terms refer alike to a third term, the second requires a second comma: as,

*&quot;Reason, virtue, answer one great aim.&quot;&amp;mdash;L. Murray, Gram., p. 269.
*&quot;To him the church, the realm, their powers consign.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;She thought the isle that gave her birth. The sweetest, wildest land on earth.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hogg.

===Words in pairs===

When successive words are joined in '''pairs''' by conjunctions, they should be separated in pairs by the comma: as,

*&quot;Interest and ambition, honour and shame, friendship and enmity, gratitude and revenge, are the prime movers in public transactions.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen.
*&quot;But, whether ingenious or dull, learned or ignorant, clownish or polite, every innocent man, without exception, has as good a right to liberty as to life.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie's Moral Science, p. 313.
*&quot;Then say how hope and fear, desire and hate, overspread with snares the crowded maze of fate.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

===Words put absolute===

Nouns or pronouns put '''absolute''', should, with their adjuncts, be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;The prince, his father being dead, succeeded.&quot;
*&quot;This done, we parted.&quot;
*&quot;Zaccheus, make haste and come down.&quot;
*&quot;His proctorship in Sicily, what did it produce?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cicero.
*&quot;Winged with his fears, on foot he strove to fly, his steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Iliad, xi, 440.

===Appositions or appositives===

Words in '''apposition''', especially if they have adjuncts, are generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;He that now calls upon you, is Theodore, the hermit of Teneriffe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;Lowth, Dr. Robert, bishop of London, born in 1710, died in 1787.&quot;&amp;mdash;Biog. Dict.
*&quot;Home, Henry, lord Kames.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.
*&quot;What next I bring shall please you, be assured, your likeness, your fit help, your other self, your wish exactly to your heart's desire.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, P. L., viii, 450.
*&quot;And he, their prince, shall rank among my peers.&quot;&amp;mdash;Byron.

===A compound name===

When several words, in their common order, are used as one compound name, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;Dr. Samuel Johnson,&quot;
*&quot;Publius Gavius Cosanus.&quot;

===United common and proper name===

When a common and a proper name are closely united, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;The brook Kidron,&quot;
*&quot;The river Don,&quot;
*&quot;The empress Catharine,&quot;
*&quot;Paul the Apostle.&quot;

===A mere emphasis and distinction===

When a pronoun is added to an other word merely for emphasis and distinction, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;You men of Athens,&quot;
*&quot;I myself,&quot;
*&quot;You flaming minister,&quot;
*&quot;You princes.&quot;

===Name acquired by action or relation===

When a name acquired by some action or relation, is put in apposition with a preceding noun or pronoun, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;I made the ground my bed;&quot;
*&quot;To make him king;&quot;
*&quot;Whom they revered as God;&quot;
*&quot;With modesty your guide.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Adjectives===

Adjectives, when something depends on them, or when they have the import of a dependent clause, should, with their '''adjuncts''', be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Among the roots of hazel, pendent over the plaintive stream, they frame the first foundation of their domes.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.
*&quot;Up springs the lark, shrill-voiced and loud, the messenger of morn.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.

===Adjective which follows its noun===

When an adjective immediately follows its noun, and is taken in a restrictive sense, the comma should not be used before it: as,

*&quot;And on the coast averse from entrance or cherubic watch.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, P. L., B. ix, l. 68.

===Finite verbs===

Where a finite verb is understood, a comma is generally required: as,

*&quot;From law arises security; from security, curiosity; from curiosity, knowledge.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray.
*&quot;Else all my prose and verse were much the same; this, prose on stilts; that, poetry fallen lame.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===A pause for the omitted verb===

As the semicolon must separate the clauses when the comma is inserted by this rule, if the pause for the omitted verb be very slight, it may be left unmarked, and the comma be used for the clauses: as,

*&quot;When the profligate speaks of piety, the miser of generosity, the coward of valour, and the corrupt of integrity, they are only the more despised by those who know them.&quot;&amp;mdash;Comstock's Elocution, p. 132.

===Infinitives===

The infinitive, when it follows a verb from which it must be separated, or when it depends on something remote or understood, is generally, with its adjuncts, set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;One of the greatest secrets in composition is, to know when to be simple.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jamieson's Rhet., p. 151. [?]
*&quot;To confess the truth, I was much in fault.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 271.
*&quot;The Governor of all&amp;mdash;has interposed, not seldom, his avenging arm, to smite the injurious trampler upon nature's law.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===Participles===

Participles, when something depends on them, when they have the import of a dependent clause, or when they relate to something understood, should, with their adjuncts, be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Law is a rule of civil conduct, prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blackstone: Beattie's Moral Science, p. 346.
*&quot;Young Edwin, lighted by the evening star, lingering and listening wandered down the vale.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.
*&quot;United, we stand; divided, we fall.&quot;&amp;mdash;Motto.
*&quot;Properly speaking, there is no such thing as chance.&quot;

===Participle which follows its noun===

When a participle immediately follows its noun, and is taken in a restrictive sense, the comma should not be used before it: as,

*&quot;A man renowned for repartee, will seldom scruple to make free with friendship's finest feeling.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===Adverbs===

Adverbs, when they '''break the connection''' of a simple sentence, or when they have not a close dependence on some particular word in the context, should, with their adjuncts, be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;We must not, however, confound this gentleness with the artificial courtesy of the world.&quot;
*&quot;Besides, the mind must be employed.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gilpin.
*&quot;Most unquestionably, no fraud was equal to all this.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lyttelton.
*&quot;But, unfortunately for us, the tide was ebbing already.&quot;
*&quot;When buttress and buttress, alternately, seem framed of ebon and ivory.&quot;&amp;mdash;Scott's Lay, p. 33.

===Conjunctions===

Conjunctions, when they are separated from the principal clauses that depend on them, or when they introduce examples, are generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;But, by a timely call upon religion, the force of habit was eluded.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;They know the neck that joins the shore and sea, or, ah! how changed that fearless laugh would be.&quot;&amp;mdash;Crabbe.

===Prepositions===

Prepositions and their objects, when they break the connection of a simple sentence, or when they do not closely follow the words on which they depend, are generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Fashion is, for the most part, nothing but the ostentation of riches.&quot;
*&quot;By reading, we add the experience of others to our own.&quot;
*&quot;In vain the sage, with retrospective eye, would from the apparent what conclude the why.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Interjections===

Interjections that require a pause, though more commonly emphatic and followed by the ecphoneme, are sometimes set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jeremiah, i, 15.
*&quot;O, it was about something you would not understand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Columbian Orator, p. 221.
*&quot;Ha, ha! you were finely taken in, then!&quot;&amp;mdash;Aikin.
*&quot;Ha, ha, ha! A facetious gentleman, truly!&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Oh, when shall Britain, conscious of her claim, stand emulous of Greek and Roman fame?&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Words emphatically repeated===

A word emphatically repeated, is generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Happy, happy, happy pair!&quot;&amp;mdash;Dryden.
*&quot;Ay, ay, there is some comfort in that.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;Ah! no, no, no.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dryden.
*&quot;The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, the moss-covered bucket, which hung in the well!&quot;&amp;mdash;Woodworth.

===Dependent quotations===

A quotation, observation, or description, when it is introduced in close dependence on a verb, (as, say, reply, cry, or the like,) is generally separated from the rest of the sentence by the comma: as,

*&quot;'The book of nature,' said he, 'is before you.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Hawkesworth.
*&quot;I say to all, watch.&quot;&amp;mdash;Mark.
*&quot;'The boy has become a man,' means, 'He has grown to be a man.' 'Such conduct becomes a man,' means, 'Such conduct befits him.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Hart's Gram., p. 116.
*&quot;While man exclaims, 'See all things for my use!' 'See man for mine!' replies a pampered goose.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

==Semicolon==

The semicolon is used to separate those parts of a compound sentence, which are neither so closely connected as those which are distinguished by the comma, nor so little dependent as those which require the colon.

===Complex members===

When two or more '''complex members''', or such clauses as require the comma in themselves, are constructed into a period, they are generally separated by the semicolon: as,

*&quot;In the regions inhabited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity forever blooms; joy flows there with a perpetual and abundant stream, nor needs any mound to check its course.&quot;&amp;mdash;Carter.
*&quot;When the voice rises, the gesture naturally ascends; and when the voice makes the falling inflection, or lowers its pitch, the gesture follows it by a corresponding descent; and, in the level and monotonous pronunciation of the voice, the gesture seems to observe a similar limitation, by moving rather in the horizontal direction, without much varying its elevation.&quot;&amp;mdash;Comstock's Elocution, p. 107.
*&quot;The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me; but shadows, clouds, and darkness, rest upon it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Addison.

===Simple members===

When two or more simple members, or such clauses as '''complete''' their sense without subdivision, are constructed into a period; if they require a pause greater than that of the comma, they are usually separated by the semicolon: as,

*&quot;Straws swim on the surface; but pearls lie at the bottom.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 276.
*&quot;Everything grows old; everything passes away; everything disappears.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hiley's Gram., p. 115.
*&quot;Alexander asked them the distance of the Persian capital; what forces the king of Persia could bring into the field; what the Persian government was; what was the character of the king; how he treated his enemies; what were the most direct ways into Persia.&quot;&amp;mdash;Whelpley's Lectures, p. 175.
*&quot;A longer care man's helpless kind demands; that longer care contracts more lasting bands.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Apposition===

Words in apposition, in '''disjunct pairs''', or in any other construction, if they require a pause greater than that of the comma, and less than that of the colon, may be separated by the semicolon: as,

*&quot;Pronouns have three cases; the nominative, the possessive, and the objective.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 51.
*&quot;Judge, judgement; lodge, lodgement; acknowledge, acknowledgement.&quot;&amp;mdash;Butler's Gram., p. 11.
*&quot;Do not the eyes discover humility, pride; cruelty, compassion; reflection, dissipation; kindness, resentment?&quot;&amp;mdash;Sheridan's Elocution, p. 159.
*&quot;This rule forbids parents to lie to children, and children to parents; instructors to pupils, and pupils to instructors; the old to the young, and the young to the old; attorneys to jurors, and jurors to attorneys; buyers to sellers, and sellers to buyers.&quot;&amp;mdash;Wayland's Moral Science, p. 304.
*&quot;Make, made; have, had; pay, paid; say, said; leave, left; dream, dreamt; mean, meant; reave and bereave have reft.&quot; &amp;mdash;Ward's Gr., p. 66.

==Colon==

The colon is used to separate those parts of a compound sentence, which are neither so closely connected as those which are distinguished by the semicolon, nor so little dependent as those which require the period.

===Additional remarks===

When the preceding clause is complete in itself, but is followed by some additional remark or '''illustration''', especially if no conjunction is used, the colon is generally and properly inserted: as,

*&quot;Avoid evil doers: in such society, an honest man may become ashamed of himself.&quot;
*&quot;See that moth fluttering incessantly round the candle: man of pleasure, behold your image!&quot;&amp;mdash;Art of Thinking, p. 94.
*&quot;Some things we can, and others we cannot do: we can walk, but we cannot fly.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beanie's Moral Science, p.  112.
*&quot;Remember heaven has an avenging rod: to smite the poor, is treason against God.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===Greater pauses===

When the semicolon has been introduced, or when it must be used in a subsequent member, and a still greater pause is required within the period, the colon should be employed: as,

*&quot;Princes have courtiers, and merchants have partners; the voluptuous have companions, and the wicked have accomplices: none but the virtuous can have friends.&quot;
*&quot;Unless the truth of our religion be granted, a christian must be the greatest monster in nature: he must at the same time be eminently wise, and notoriously foolish; a wise man in his practice, and a fool in his belief: his reasoning powers must be deranged by a constant delirium, while his conduct never swerves from the path of propriety.&quot;&amp;mdash;Principles of Eloquence, p. 80
*&quot;A decent competence we fully taste; it strikes our sense, and gives a constant feast: more we perceive by dint of thought alone; the rich must labour to possess their own.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

===Independent quotations===

A quotation introduced without a close dependence on a verb or a conjunction, is generally preceded by the colon: as,

*&quot;In his last moments, he uttered these words: 'I fall a sacrifice to sloth and luxury.'&quot;
*&quot;At this the king hastily retorted: 'No put-offs, my lord; answer me presently.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Churchill's Gram., p. 367.
*&quot;The father addressed himself to them to this effect: 'O my sons, behold the power of unity!'&quot;&amp;mdash; Rippingham's Art of Speaking, p. 85.

==Period==

The period, or full stop, is used to mark an entire and independent sentence, whether simple or compound.

===Distinct sentences===

When a sentence, whether long or short, is complete in respect to sense, and independent in respect to construction, it should be marked with the period: as,

*&quot;Every deviation from truth is criminal. Abhor a falsehood. Let your words be ingenuous. Sincerity possesses the most powerful charm.&quot;
*&quot;The force of a true individual is felt through every clause and part of a right book; the commas and dashes are alive with it.&quot;&amp;mdash;R. W.  Emerson.
*&quot;By frequent trying, Troy was won. All things, by trying, may be done.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lloyd, p. 184.

===Allied sentences===

The period is often employed between two sentences which have a general connection, expressed by a personal pronoun, a conjunction, or a conjunctive adverb: as,

*&quot;The selfish man languishes in his narrow circle of pleasures. They are confined to what affects his own interests. He is obliged to repeat the same gratifications, till they become insipid. But the man of virtuous sensibility moves in a wider sphere of felicity.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blair.
*&quot;And whether we shall meet again, I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak., J. C.

===Abbreviations===

The period is generally used after abbreviations, and very often to the exclusion of other points; but, as in this case it is not a constant sign of pause, other points may properly follow it, if the words written in full would demand them: as, A. D. for Anno Domini; Pro tem. for pro tempore; Ult. for
ultimo; i.e. for id est, that is;

*&quot;Add., Spect, No. 285.&quot;
*For &quot;Addison, in the Spectator, Number 285th.&quot;
*&quot;Consult the statute; 'Quart.' I think, it is, 'Edwardi sext.,' or 'prim. et quint. Eliz.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, p. 399.

==Dash==

The dash is mostly used to denote an unexpected or emphatic pause, of variable length; but sometimes it is a sign of faltering, or of the irregular stops of one who hesitates in speaking: as,

*&quot;Then, after many pauses, and inarticulate sounds, he said: 'He was very sorry for it, was extremely concerned it should happen so&amp;mdash;but&amp;mdash;a&amp;mdash;it was necessary&amp;mdash;a&amp;mdash;' Here lord E&amp;mdash; stopped him short, and bluntly demanded, if his post were destined for an other.&quot;&amp;mdash;Churchill's Gram., p. 170.

===Abrupt pauses===

A sudden interruption, break, or transition, should be marked with the dash: as,

*&quot;'I must inquire into the affair; and if'&amp;mdash;'And if!' interrupted the farmer.&quot;
*&quot;Whom I&amp;mdash;But first it is fit the billows to restrain.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dryd. Virg. 3.
*&quot;Here lies the great&amp;mdash;False marble! where?  Nothing but sordid dust lies here.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

===Emphatic pauses===

To mark a considerable pause, greater than the structure or the sentence or the points inserted would seem to require, the dash may be employed: as,

*&quot;I pause for a reply.&amp;mdash;None?&amp;mdash;Then none have I offended.&amp;mdash;I have done no more to Caesar, than you should do to Brutus.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shakspeare: Enfields Speaker, p. 182.
*&quot;Tarry a little. There is something else.&amp;mdash;This bond&amp;mdash;doesn't give you here&amp;mdash;no jot of blood.&quot; &amp;mdash;ID.: Burgh's Sp., p. 167.
*&quot;It thunders;&amp;mdash;but it thunders to preserve.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;Behold the picture!&amp;mdash;Is it like?&amp;mdash;Like whom?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===Faulty dashes===

Dashes needlessly inserted, or substituted for other stops more definite, are in general to be treated as errors in punctuation: as,

*&quot;Here Greece stands by itself as opposed to the other nations of antiquity&amp;mdash;She was none of the other nations&amp;mdash;She was more polished than they.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lennie's Gram., p. 78.
*&quot;Here Greece stands by herself, as opposed to the other nations of antiquity. She was none of the other nations: she was more polished than they.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bullions, E. Gram., p. 114.

If this colon is sufficient, the capital after it is needless: a period would, perhaps, be better.

==Note of interrogation==

The eroteme, or note of interrogation, is used to designate a question.

===Questions direct===

Questions expressed directly as such, if finished, should always be followed by the note of interrogation: as,

*&quot;Was it possible that virtue so exalted should be erected upon injustice? that the proudest and the most ambitious of mankind should be the great master and accomplished pattern of humility? that a doctrine so pure as the Gospel should be the work of an uncommissioned pretender? that so perfect a system of morals should be established on blasphemy?&quot;&amp;mdash;Jerningham's Essay, p. 81.
*&quot;In life, can love be bought with gold? Are friendship's pleasures to be sold?&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.

===Questions united===

When two or more questions are united in one compound sentence, the comma, semicolon, or dash, is sometimes used to separate them, and the eroteme occurs after the last only: as,

*&quot;When&amp;mdash;under what administration&amp;mdash;under what exigencies of war or peace&amp;mdash;did the Senate ever before deal with such a measure in such a manner? Never, sir, never.&quot;&amp;mdash;D. Webster, in Congress, 1846.
*&quot;Cannot you, and honoured with a christian name, buy what is woman-born, and feel no shame; trade in the blood of innocence, and plead expedience as a warrant for the deed?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.
*&quot;Truths would you teach, or save a sinking land? All fear, none aid you, and few understand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Questions indirect===

When a question is mentioned, but not put directly as a question, it loses both the quality and the sign of interrogation: as,

*&quot;The Cyprians asked me why I wept.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray.

==Note of exclamation==

The ecphoneme, or note of exclamation, is used to denote a pause with some strong emotion of admiration, joy, grief, or other feeling; and, as a sign of great wonder, it is sometimes, though not very elegantly, repeated: as,

*&quot;Grammatical consistency!!! What a gem!&quot;&amp;mdash;Peirce's Gram., p. 352.

===Interjections===

Emphatic interjections, and other expressions of great emotion, are generally followed by the note of exclamation: as,

*&quot;Hold! hold! Is the devil in you? Oh! I am bruised all over.&quot;&amp;mdash;Molière: Burgh's Speaker, p.  250.
*&quot;And O! till earth, and seas, and heaven decay, never may that fair creation fade away!&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Lowth.

===Invocations===

After an earnest address or solemn invocation, the note of exclamation is now generally preferred to any other point: as,

*&quot;Whereupon, O king Agrippa! I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, xxvi, 19.
*&quot;Be witness you, immortal Lord of all! Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Exclamatory questions===

Words uttered with vehemence in the form of a question, but without reference to an answer, should be followed by the note of exclamation: as,

*&quot;How madly have I talked!&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;An Author! It is a venerable name! How few deserve it, and what numbers claim!&quot;&amp;mdash;Id., Br. Po., viii, 401.

==Curves==

The curves, or marks of parenthesis, are used to distinguish a clause or hint that is hastily thrown in between the parts of a sentence to which it does not properly belong: as,

*&quot;Their enemies (and enemies they will always have) would have a handle for exposing their measures.&quot;&amp;mdash;Walpole.
*&quot;To others do (the law is not severe) what to yourself you wish to be done.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.

The incidental clause should be uttered in a lower tone, and faster than the principal sentence. It always requires a pause as great as that of a comma, or greater.

===Parenthesis===

A clause that breaks the unity of a sentence or passage too much to be incorporated with it, and only such, should be inclosed within curves, as a parenthesis: as,

*&quot;For I know that in me, (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rom., vii, 18.
*&quot;Know then this truth, (enough for man to know,) virtue alone is happiness below.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Included points===

The curves do not supersede other stops; and, as the parenthesis terminates with a pause equal to that which precedes it, the same point should be included, except when the sentences differ in form: as,

*&quot;Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.&quot;&amp;mdash;2 Cor., vi, 13.
*&quot;Man's thirst of happiness declares it is: (for nature never gravitates to nought:) that thirst unquenched, declares it is not here.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;Night visions may befriend: (as sung above:) our waking dreams are fatal. How I dreamt of things impossible! (could sleep do more?) of joys perpetual in perpetual change!&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

==Apostrophe==

The apostrophe usually denotes either the possessive case of a noun, or the elision of one or more letters of a word: as,

*&quot;The girl's regard to her parents' advice;&quot;

'Gan, lov'd, e'en, thro'; for began, loved, even, through. It is sometimes used in pluralizing a mere letter or sign: as,

*&quot;Two a's&amp;mdash;three 6's.&quot;

==Hyphen==

The hyphen connects the parts of many compound words, especially such as have two accents: as, ever-living. It is also frequently inserted where a word is divided into syllables: as, con-tem-plate. Placed at the end of a line, it shows that one or more syllables of a word are can led forward to the next line.

==Diaeresis==

The diaeresis, or dialysis, placed over either of two contiguous vowels, shows that they are not a diphthong: as, ''Danaee, aerial''.

==Acute accent==

The acute accent marks the syllable which requires the principal stress in pronunciation: as, e'qual, equal'ity. It is sometimes used in opposition to the grave accent, to distinguish a close or short vowel: as, ''Fancy''; or
to denote the rising inflection of the voice: as,

*&quot;Is it he?&quot;

==Grave accent==

The grave accent is used in opposition to the acute, to distinguish an open or long vowel: as, ''Favour''; or to denote the falling inflection of the voice: as,

*&quot;Yes; it is he.&quot;

It is sometimes placed over a vowel to show that it is not to be suppressed in pronunciation: as,

*&quot;Let me, though in humble speech, your refined maxims teach.&quot;&amp;mdash;Amer. Review, May, 1848.

==Circumflex==

The circumflex generally denotes either the broad sound of a or an unusual sound given to some other vowel: as in all, heir, machine. Some use it to mark a peculiar wave of the voice, and when occasion requires, reverse it: as,

*&quot;If you said sô, then I said so.&quot;

==Breve==

The breve, or stenotone, is used to denote either the close, short, shut sound of a vowel, or a syllable of short quantity: as, lĭve, to have life; răven, to devour; călămŭs, a reed.

==Macron==

The macron, or macrotone, is used to denote either the open, long, primal sound of a vowel, or a syllable of long quantity: as, līve, having life; rāven, a bird; ēquīne, of a horse.

==Ellipsis==

The ellipsis, or suppression, denotes the omission of some letters or words: as, K…g, for King; c…d, for coward; d…d, for damned.

==Caret==

The caret, used only in writing, shows where to insert words or letters that have been accidentally omitted.

==Tilde==

The tilde, &quot;ã&quot;, is a diacritic mark, and tilde over a letter is used to make abbreviations.

==Brace==

The brace serves to unite a triplet; or, more frequently, to connect several terms with something to which they are all related.

==Section==

The section marks the smaller divisions of a book or chapter; and, with the help of numbers, serves to abridge references.

==Paragraph==

The paragraph denotes the commencement of a new subject. The parts of discourse which are called paragraphs, are, in general, sufficiently distinguished by beginning a new line, and carrying the first word a little forwards or backwards. The paragraphs of books being in some instances numbered, this character may occasionally be used, in lieu of the word paragraph, to shorten references.

==Quotation points==

The guillements, or quotation points, distinguish words that are exhibited as those of an other author or speaker. A quotation within a quotation, is usually marked with single points; which, when both are employed, are placed within the others: as,

*&quot;And again he said, 'Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Rom., xv, 10.

==Brackets==

The crotchets, or brackets, generally inclose some correction or explanation, but sometimes the sign or subject to be explained: as,

*&quot;He [Mr. Maurice] was of a different opinion.&quot;&amp;mdash;Allen's Gram., p. 213.

==Index==

The index, or hand, points out something remarkable, or what the reader should particularly observe.

==Asterisk==

The asterisk, or star, the obelisk, or dagger, the diesis, or double dagger, the section, the parallels, and the paragraph, refer to marginal notes. Where many references are to be made, the small letters of the alphabet, or the numerical figures, in their order, may be conveniently used for the same purpose.

==Asterism==

The asterism, or three stars, a sign not very often used, is placed before a long or general note, to mark it as a note, without giving it a particular reference.

==Cedilla==

The cedilla is borrowed from the French. It is placed under the letter ''c'', to give it the sound of ''s'', before ''a'' or ''o'': as, ''Façade'', ''Alençon''. It is sometimes attached to other letters, to denote their soft sounds: Ģ as ''J''; Ş as ''Z''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sogno==
Era da tempo che sognavo un mezzo grazie al quale gli studenti, gli studiosi e magari anche qualche docente, potessero condividere facilmente testi ed appunti. 

Un mezzo che potesse in qualche modo far nascere dei testi adatti a trasmettere la conoscenza semplicemente. Con testi scritti semplicemente, che potessero crescere e svilupparsi a seconda delle necessita di chi li usava. Che potessero essere semplici e allo stesso tempo potessero addentrarsi in profondità seguento anche i più piccoli dettagli di un argomento.

Sono stato affascinato nello scoprire che, in alcuni paesi, il testo di riferimento di un certo corso X, era lo stesso usato in tutti i corsi X della stessa facolta o della stessa università. Un testo che veniva scritto in comune da tutti i docenti, secondo le esigenze del corso X. Il testo veniva adattato annualmente alle esigenze degli studenti, veniva rivisto, corretto, semplificato, ampliato o approfondito di comune accordo con i rappresentanti degli studenti. Credo che potremmo realizzare qualcosa di simile, ognuno mettendoci del suo.

Credo che questo strumento possa realizzare tutto questo.</text>

==Letters==

''A a, B b, C c, D d, E e, F f, G g, H h, I i, J j, K k, L l, M m, N n, O o, P p, Q q, R r, S s, T t, U u, V v, W w, X x, Y y, Z z''.

The names of the '''letters''', as now commonly spoken and written in American English, are: ''Ay, Bee, Cee, Dee, Ee, Ef, Gee, Aitch, I, Jay, Kay, El, Em, En, O, Pee, Que, Ar, Es, Tee, Yu, Vee, Double-Yu, Ex, Wye, Zee'' (or ''Zed'' in British English).

A '''vowel''' is a letter which forms a perfect sound when pronounced alone. The vowels are ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', partly ''w'' and sometimes ''y''. All the other letters are consonants.

A '''consonant''' is a letter which cannot be perfectly pronounced until joined to a vowel. ''B'', ''c'', and ''d''. ''W'' and ''y'' are consonants when they precede a vowel heard in the same syllable, as in ''wine, twine, whine, year, yet'', and ''youth''; in all other cases, these letters are vowels, as in ''Yssel, Ystadt, yttria, newly, dewy'', and ''eyebrow''.

A '''semivowel''' is a consonant which can be imperfectly sounded without a vowel, so that at the end of a syllable its sound may be protracted; for example, ''l'', ''n'', and ''z'', in ''al, an'', and ''az''. The semivowels are: ''f'', ''h'', ''j'', ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''r'', ''s'', ''v'', ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and soft ''c'' and ''g''; but ''w'' or ''y'' at the end of a syllable are vowels, and the sounds of ''c'', ''f'', ''g'', ''h'', ''j'', ''s'', and ''x'' can be protracted only as an '''aspirate''', or strong breath.

Four of the semivowels&amp;mdash;''l'', ''m'', ''n'', and ''r''&amp;mdash;are termed '''liquids''', on account of the fluency of their sounds; and four others&amp;mdash;''v'', ''w'', ''y'', and ''z''&amp;mdash;are likewise more vocal than the aspirates.

A '''mute''' is a consonant which cannot be sounded at all without a vowel, and which at the end of a syllable suddenly stops the breath; for example, ''k'', ''p'', and ''t'', in ''ak, ap'', and ''at''. The mutes are eight: ''b'', ''d'', ''k'', ''p'', ''q'', ''t'', and hard ''c'' and ''g''; three of these&amp;mdash;''k'', ''q'', and hard ''c''&amp;mdash;sound exactly alike, and ''b'', ''d'', and hard ''g'' stop the voice less suddenly than the rest.

==Powers of the letters==

The powers of the letters are those '''elementary sounds''' which their figures are used to represent. The simple elementary sounds of any language are few, commonly not more than thirty-six. Different vowel sounds are produced by opening the mouth differently, and placing the tongue in a peculiar manner for each; but the voice may vary in loudness, pitch, or time, and still utter the same vowel.

The '''vowel sounds''' are those which are heard at the beginning of the following words: ''ate, at, ah, all, eel, ell, isle, ill, old, on, ooze, use, us'', and that of ''u'' in ''bull''. Let us note them as plainly as possible: ''eigh, ~a, ah, awe, ~eh, ~e, eye, ~i, oh, ~o, oo, yew, ~u'', and ''u''. ''~a'' is a sound generally given to the word ''a'': as,

*&quot;Twice a day.&quot;

In the formation of syllables, some of these fourteen primary sounds may be joined together, as in ''ay, oil, out, owl''. These  essential sounds may be changed into a series of words by ''f'': as, ''fate, fat, far, fall, feel, fell, file, fill, fold, fond, fool, fuse, fuss, full''. Again, into as many with ''p'': as, ''pate, pat, par, pall, peel, pell, pile, pill, pole, pond, pool, pule, purl, pull''. The eight long sounds, ''eigh, ah, awe, eh, eye, oh, ooh, yew'', may be words; but the short vowel sounds, as in ''at, et, it, ot, ut, put'', are commonly heard only in connection with consonants.

The '''simple consonant sounds''' are twenty-two: ''b, d, f, g hard, h, k, l, m, n, ng, p, r, s, sh, t, th sharp, th flat, v, w, y, z'', and ''zh''. ''Zh'' is written only to show the sound of other letters: as of ''s'' in ''pleasure'', or ''z'' in ''azure''.

All these sounds are heard in the following words: ''buy, die, fie, guy, high, kie, lie, my, nigh, eying, pie, rye, sigh, shy, tie, thigh, thy, vie, we, ye, zebra, seizure''. Most of them may be repeated in the same word or syllable: as, ''bibber, diddle, fifty, giggle, high-hung, cackle, lily, mimic, ninny, singing, pippin, mirror, hissest, flesh-brush, tittle, thither, vivid, witwal, union, dizzies, vision''.

The consonants ''j'' and ''x'' represent complex sounds; hence they are never doubled. ''J'' is equivalent to ''dzh''; and ''x'', either to ''ks'' or to ''gz''. The former ends no English word, and the latter begins none. To the initial ''z'' of foreign words, we always give the simple sound of ''z'': as in ''Xerxes, xebec''.

The consonants ''c'' and ''q'' have no sounds peculiar to themselves. ''Q'' has always the power of ''k''. ''C'' is hard, like ''k'', before ''a, o'', and ''u''; and soft, like ''s'', before ''e, i'', and ''y''. Thus the syllables, ''ca, ce, ci, co, cu, cy'', are pronounced, ''ka, se, si, ko, ku, sy''. ''S'' before ''c'' preserves the former sound, but coalesces with the latter. Hence the syllables, ''sca, sce, sci, sco, scu, scy'', are sounded, ''ska, se, si, sko, sku, sy''. ''Ce'' and ''ci'' have sometimes the sound of ''sh'': as, ''ocean, social''. ''Ch'' commonly represents the compound sound of ''tsh'': as in ''church''.

''G'', as well as ''c'', has different sounds before different vowels. ''G'' is always hard, or guttural, before ''a, o'', and ''u''; and generally soft, like ''j'', before ''e, i'', or ''y''. Thus the syllables, ''ga, ge, gi, go, gu, gy'', are pronounced ''ga, je, ji, go, gu, jy''.

==Forms of the letters==

In printed books, the '''Roman characters''' are generally employed; sometimes, the italic. In handwriting, script letters are used.

Characters of different sorts or sizes should never be needlessly mixed; because facility of reading, as well as the beauty of a book, depends much on the regularity of its letters.

'''Italics''' are chiefly used to distinguish emphatic or remarkable words: in the Bible, they show what words were supplied by the translators.

In manuscripts, a single line drawn under a word is meant for Italics; a double line, for bold or small capitals.

'''Small letters''' constitute the body of every word; and capitals are used for the sake of eminence and distinction. Showbills, painted signs, and short inscriptions, commonly appear best in full '''capitals'''. Some of these are so copied in books: as,

*&quot;I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.&quot;&amp;mdash;Acts, xvii, 23.
*&quot;And they set up over his head, his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;&amp;mdash;Matt., xxvii, 37.

==Capitals==

When particular books are mentioned by their names, the chief words in their '''titles''' begin with capitals, and the other letters are small: as, 

*&quot;Pope's Essay on Man,&quot;
*&quot;The Book of Common Prayer,&quot;
*&quot;The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.&quot;

The first word of every distinct '''sentence''', or of any clause separately numbered or paragraphed, should begin with a capital: as,

*&quot;Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things: hold fast that which is good.&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Thess., v, 16&amp;mdash;21.
*&quot;14. He has given his assent to their acts of pretended legislation: 15. For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: 16. For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for murders: 17. For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world: 18. For imposing taxes on us without our consent.&quot;&amp;mdash;Declaration of American Independence.

All names of the '''deity''', and sometimes their emphatic substitutes, should begin with capitals: as, ''God, Jehovah, the Almighty, the Supreme Being, Divine Providence, the Messiah, the Comforter, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, the Lord of Sabaoth''.

*&quot;The hope of my spirit turns trembling to You.&quot;&amp;mdash;Moore.

'''Proper names''', of every description, should always begin with capitals: as, ''Saul of Tarsus, Simon Peter, Judas Iscariot, England, London, the Strand, the Thames, the Pyrenees, the Vatican, the Greeks, the Argo and the Argonauts''.

'''Titles of office''' or honour, and epithets of distinction, applied to persons, begin usually with capitals: as, ''His Majesty William the Fourth, Chief Justice Marshall, Sir Matthew Hale, Dr. Johnson, the Rev. Dr. Chalmers, Lewis the Bold, Charles the Second, James the Less, St. Bartholomew, Pliny the Younger, Noah Webster, Jun., Esq''.

Those compound proper names which by analogy incline to a union of their parts without a hyphen, should be so written, and have but one capital: as, ''Eastport, Eastville, Westborough, Westfield, Westtown, Whitehall, Whitechurch, Whitehaven, Whiteplains, Mountmellick, Mountpleasant, Germantown, Germanflats, Blackrock, Redhook, Kinderhook, Newfoundland, Statenland, Newcastle, Northcastle, Southbridge, Fairhaven, Dekalb, Deruyter, Lafayette, Macpherson''.

The compounding of a name under one capital should be avoided when the general analogy of other similar terms suggests a separation under two: as,

*&quot;The chief mountains of Ross-shire are Ben Chat, Benchasker, Ben Golich, Ben Nore, Ben Foskarg, and Ben Wyvis.&quot;&amp;mdash;Glasgow Geog., Vol. ii, p. 311.

Write ''Ben Chasker''.

When the word ''East, West, North'', or ''South'', as part of a name, denotes relative position, or when the word ''New'' distinguishes a place by contrast, we have generally separate words and two capitals: as, ''East Greenwich, West Greenwich, North Bridgewater, South Bridgewater, New Jersey, New Hampshire''.

When any adjective or common noun is made a distinct part of a compound proper name, it ought to begin with a capital: as, ''the United States, the Argentine Republic, the Peak of Teneriffe, the Blue Ridge, the Little Pedee, Long Island, Jersey City, Lower Canada, Green Bay, Gretna Green, Land's End, the Gold Coast''.

When a common and a proper name are associated merely to explain each other, it is in general sufficient, if the proper name begin with a capital, and the appellative, with a small letter: as, ''the prophet Elisha, Matthew the publican, the brook Cherith, the river Euphrates, the Ohio river, Warren county, Flatbush village, New York city''.

The name of an '''object personified''', when it conveys an idea strictly individual, should begin with a capital: as,

*&quot;On this, Fancy began again to bestir herself.&quot;&amp;mdash;Addison.

*&quot;Come, gentle Spring, ethereal mildness, come.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.

'''Words derived from proper names''', and having direct reference to particular persons, places, sects, or nations, should begin with capitals: as, ''Platonic, Newtonian, Greek, Roman, Italic, or Italian, German, or Germanic, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese, Genoese, French, Dutch, Scotch, Welsh'': so, perhaps, to ''Platonize'', to ''Grecize'', to ''Romanize'', to ''Italicize'', to ''Latinize'', or to ''Frenchify''.

The words '''I''' and '''O''' should always be capitals: as,

*&quot;Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion.&quot;&amp;mdash;Psalm cxlvii.
*&quot;O wretched man that I am!&quot;
*&quot;For that which I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rom., vii, 24 and 15.

Every '''line in poetry''', except what is regarded as making but one verse with the line preceding, should begin with a capital: as,

*&quot;Our sons their fathers' failing language see, And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

Of the exception, some editions of the Psalms in Metre are full of examples: as,

*&quot;Happy the man whose tender care relieves the poor distressed! When troubles compass him around, the Lord shall give him rest.&quot;&amp;mdash;Psalms with Com. Prayer, N. Y., 1819, Ps. xli.

The first word of a full example, of a distinct speech, or of a direct '''quotation''', should begin with a capital: as, 

*&quot;Remember this maxim: 'Know yourself.'&quot;
*&quot;Virgil says, 'Labour conquers all things.'&quot;
*&quot;Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?&quot;&amp;mdash;John, x, 34.
*&quot;You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour your father and your mother.&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, xviii, 20.

Other words of particular '''importance''', and such as denote the principal subjects treated of, may be distinguished by capitals; and names subscribed frequently have capitals throughout: as,

*&quot;In its application to the Executive, with reference to the Legislative branch of the Government, the same rule of action should make the President ever anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary authority which can be regulated by Congress.&quot;&amp;mdash;Andrew Jackson, 1835.

Capitals are improper wherever there is not some special rule or reason for their use: as,

*&quot;Many a Noble Genius is lost for want of Education. Which would then be Much More Liberal. As it was when the Church Enjoyed her Possessions. And Learning was, in the Dark Ages, Preserved almost only among the Clergy.&quot;&amp;mdash;Charles Leslie, 1700; Divine Right of Tythes, p. 228.

==Compounding==

===Compounds===

Words regularly or analogically united, and commonly known as forming a compound, should never be needlessly broken apart. Thus, ''steamboat, railroad, red-hot, well-being, new-coined'', are preferable to ''steam boat, rail road, red hot, well being, new coined''.

===Simples===

When the simple words would form a regular phrase, the compounding of any of them ought to be avoided: as, ''in lieu of, in place of, in room of''.

===The sense===

Words otherwise liable to be misunderstood, must be joined together or written separately, as the sense and construction may happen to require. Thus, a ''glass house'' is a house made of glass, but a ''glasshouse'' is a house in which glass is made.

===Ellipsis===

When two or more compounds are connected in one sentence, none of them should be split to make an ellipsis of half a word. Thus, ''six or seventeen'' should not be said for ''sixteen or seventeen''; nor ought we to say, ''calf, goat, and sheepskins'' for ''calfskins, goatskins, and sheepskins''. In the latter instance, however, it might be right to separate all the words: as,

*&quot;Soup, coffee, and tea houses.&quot;&amp;mdash;Liberator, x, 40.

===Hyphen===

When the parts of a compound do not fully coalesce, or when each retains its original accent, as ''first-born, hanger-on, laughter-loving, garlic-eater, butterfly-shell'', the hyphen should be inserted between them.

===No hyphen===

When a compound has but one accented syllable, as ''watchword, statesman, gentleman'', and the parts are such as admit of a complete coalescence, no hyphen should be inserted between them: as,

*&quot;The practical instruction of the countinghouse imparts a more thorough knowledge of bookkeeping, than all the fictitious transactions of a mere schoolbook, however carefully constructed to suit particular purposes.&quot;&amp;mdash;New Gram., p. vii.

==Spelling==

===Final f, l, or s===

Monosyllables ending in ''f, l'', or ''s'', preceded by a single vowel, double the final consonant: as, ''staff, mill, pass, muff, knell, gloss, off, hiss, puss''.

The words ''clef, if'', and ''of'', are written with single ''f''; as, ''gas, has, was, yes, his, is, this, us, pus'', and ''thus'', with single ''s''; and ''bul, nul, sol'', and ''sal'', with single ''l''.

===Other finals===

Words ending in any other consonant than ''f, l'', or ''s'', do not double the final letter: as, ''mob, nod, dog, sum, sun, cup, cur, cut, fix, whiz, ab, ad, jag, rag, in, bur, but''.

We double the consonant in ''abb, ebb, add, odd, egg, jagg, ragg, inn, err, burr, purr, butt, buzz, fuzz, yarr'', and some proper names.

===Doubling before additional syllable===

Monosyllables, and words accented on the last syllable, when they end with a single consonant '''preceded by a single vowel''', or by a vowel after qu, double their final consonant before an additional syllable that begins with a vowel: as, ''rob, robbed, robber; fop, foppish, foppery; squat, squatter, squatting; thin, thinner, thinnest; swim, swimmer, swimming; commit, committing, committed, committer, committees; acquit, acquittal, acquittance, acquitted, acquitting''.

''X'' final, being equivalent to ''ks'', is never doubled: thus, from ''mix'', we have ''mixed, mixing'', and ''mixer''.

When the derivative retains not the accent of the root, the final consonant is not always doubled: as, prefer', pref'erence, pref'erable; refer', ref'erence, ref'erable, or refer'rible; infer', in'ference, in'ferable, or infer'rible;
transfer', a trans'fer, trans'ferable, or transfer'rible.

But letters doubled in Latin, are usually doubled in English, without regard to accent, or to any other principle: as, Britain, Britan'nic, Britannia; appeal, appel'lant; argil, argil'laus, argilla'ceous; cavil, cav'illous, cavilla'tion;
excel', ex'cellent, ex'cellence; inflame', inflam'mable, inflamma'tion.

===No doubling before additional syllable===

A final consonant, when it is '''not preceded by a single vowel''', or when the accent is not on the last syllable, should remain single before an additional syllable: as, ''toil, toiling; oil, oily; visit, visited; differ, differing; peril, perilous; viol, violist; real, realize, realist; dial, dialing, dialist; equal, equalize, equality; vitriol, vitriolic, vitriolate''.

The final ''l'' of words ending in ''el'', must be doubled before another vowel, lest the power of the ''e'' be mistaken, and a syllable be lost: as, ''travel, traveller; duel, duellist; revel, revelling; gravel, gravelly; marvel, marvellous''. Yet the word ''parallel'', having three ''l''-s already, conforms to the rule in forming its derivatives: as, ''paralleling, paralleled'', and ''unparalleled''.

Contrary to the preceding rule, the preterits, participles, and derivative nouns, of the few verbs ending in ''al, il'', or ''ol'', unaccented,&amp;mdash;namely, ''equal, rival, vial, marshal, victual, cavil, pencil, carol, gambol'', and ''pistol'',&amp;mdash;are usually allowed to double the ''l'', though some dissent from the practice: as, ''equalled, equalling; rivalled, rivalling; cavilled, cavilling, caviller; carolled, carolling, caroller''.

When ''ly'' follows ''l'', we have two Ells of course, but in fact no doubling: as, ''real, really; oral, orally; cruel, cruelly; civil, civilly; cool, coolly; wool, woolly''.

Compounds, though they often remove the principal accent from the point of duplication, always retain the double letter: as, wit'snapper, kid'napper, grass'hopper, duck'-legged, spur'galled, hot'spurred, broad'-brimmed, hare'-lipped, half-witted. So, ''compromitted'' and ''manumitted''; but ''benefited'' is different.

===Final ck===

Monosyllables and English verbs end not with ''c'', but take ''ck'' for double ''c'': as, ''rack, wreck, rock, attack'': but, in general, words derived from the learned languages need not the ''k'', and common use discards it: as, ''Italic, maniac, music, public''.

The words ''arc'', ''orc'', ''lac'', ''sac'', and ''soc'', are ended with ''c'' only. ''Zinc'' is, perhaps, better spelled ''zink''; ''marc, mark''; ''disc, disk''; and ''talc, talck''.

===Words ending with a double letter===

Words ending with any double letter, '''preserve it double''' before any additional termination, not beginning with the same letter: as in the following derivatives: ''wooer, seeing, blissful, oddly, gruffly, equally, shelly, hilly, stiffness, illness, stillness, shrillness, fellness, smallness, drollness,
freeness, grassless, passless, carelessness, recklessness, embarrassment, enfeoffment, agreement, agreeable''.

Certain irregular derivatives in ''d'' or ''t'', from verbs ending in ''ee, ll'', or ''ss'', as ''fled'' from ''flee'', ''sold'' from ''sell'', ''told'' from ''tell'', ''dwelt'' from ''dwell'', ''spelt'' from ''spell'', ''spilt'' from ''spill'', ''blest'' from ''bless'', ''past'' from ''pass'', are exceptions to the foregoing rule.

If the word ''pontiff'' is properly spelled with two ''f''-s, its eight derivatives are also exceptions to this rule; for they are severally spelled with one: as, ''pontific, pontifical, pontificate'', etc.

The words ''skillful, skillfully, willful, willfully, chillness, tallness, dullness'', and ''fullness'', have generally been allowed to drop the second ''l'', though all of them might well be made to conform to the general rule, agreeably to the orthography of Webster.

Words ending with any double letter, preserve it double in all derivatives formed from them by means of prefixes: as, ''see, foresee; feoff, enfeoff; pass, repass; press, depress; miss, amiss; call, recall; stall, forestall; thrall, inthrall; spell, misspell; tell, foretell; sell, undersell; add, superadd; snuff, besnuff; swell, overswell''.

===Final ll===

Final ''ll'' is peculiar to monosyllables and their compounds, with the few derivatives formed from such roots by prefixes; consequently, all other words that end in ''l'', must be terminated with a single ''l'': as, ''cabal, logical, appal, excel, rebel, refel, dispel, extol, control, mogul, jackal, rascal, damsel, handsel, tinsel, tendril, tranquil, gambol, consul''.

===Final e===

The final ''e'' of a primitive word, when this letter is mute or obscure, is generally '''omitted''' before an additional termination beginning with a vowel: as, ''remove, removal; rate, ratable; force, forcible; true, truism; rave, raving; sue, suing; eye, eying; idle, idling; centre, centring''.

Words ending in ''ce'' or ''ge'', retain the ''e'' before ''able'' or ''ous'', to preserve the soft sounds of ''c'' and ''g'': as, ''trace, traceable; change, changeable; outrage, outrageous''.

So, from ''shoe'', we write ''shoeing'', to preserve the sound of the root; from ''hoe, hoeing'', by apparent analogy; and, from ''singe, singeing''; from ''swinge, swingeing''; from ''tinge, tingeing''; that they may not be confounded with singing, swinging, and tinging.

To compounds and prefixes, as ''firearms, forearm, anteact, viceagent'', the rule does not apply; and final ''ee'' remains double, as in ''disagreeable, disagreeing''.

The final ''e'' of a primitive word is generally retained before an additional termination beginning with a consonant: as, ''pale, paleness; edge, edgeless; judge, judgeship; lodge, lodgement; change, changeful; infringe, infringement''.

When the ''e'' is preceded by a vowel, it is sometimes omitted: as in ''duly, truly, awful, argument''; but much more frequently retained: as in ''dueness, trueness, blueness, bluely, rueful, dueful, shoeless, eyeless''.

The word ''wholly'' is also an exception to the rule, for nobody writes it ''wholely''.

Some will have ''judgment, abridgment'', and ''acknowledgment'', to be irreclaimable exceptions; but on the authority of Lowth, Beattie, Ainsworth, Walker, Cobb, Chalmers and others, they retain ''e''.

===Final y preceded by a consonant===

The final ''y'' of a primitive word, when preceded by a consonant, is generally '''changed into''' ''i'' before an additional termination: as, ''merry, merrier, merriest, merrily, merriment; pity, pitied, pities, pitiest, pitiless, pitiful, pitiable; contrary, contrariness, contrarily''.

This rule applies to derivatives, but not to compounds: thus, we write ''merciful'', and ''mercy-seat''; ''penniless'', and ''pennyworth''; ''scurviness'', and ''scurvy-grass''; etc. But ''ladyship'' and ''goodyship'', being unlike ''secretariship'' and ''suretiship''; ''handicraft'' and ''handiwork'', unlike ''handygripe'' and ''handystroke''; ''babyship'' and ''babyhood'', unlike ''stateliness'' and likelihood''; the distinction between derivatives and compounds, we see, is too nice a point to have been always accurately observed.

Before ''ing'' or ''ish'', the ''y'' is retained to prevent the doubling of ''i'': as, ''pity, pitying; baby, babyish''. 

Words ending in ''ie'', dropping the ''e'', change the ''i'' into ''y'', for the same reason: as, ''die, dying; vie, vying; lie, lying''.

===Final y preceded by a vowel===

The final ''y'' of a primitive word, when preceded by a vowel, should not be changed into ''i'' before any additional termination: as, ''day, days; key, keys; guy, guys; valley, valleys; coy, coyly; cloy, cloys, cloyed; boy, boyish, boyhood; annoy, annoyer, annoyance; joy, joyless, joyful''.

From ''lay, pay, say'', and ''stay'', are formed ''laid, paid, said'', and ''staid''; but the regular words, ''layed, payed, stayed'', are sometimes used.

''Raiment'', contracted from ''arrayment'', is never written with the ''y''. ''Daily'' is more common than the regular form ''dayly''; but ''gayly, gayety'', and ''gayness'', are justly superseding ''gaily'' and ''gaiety''.

===Ize and ise===

Words ending in ''ize'' or ''ise'', as ''wise'' and ''size'', generally take the ''z'' in all such as are essentially formed by means of the termination; and the ''s'' in monosyllables, and in all such as are essentially formed by means of prefixes: ''gormandize, apologize, brutalize, canonize, pilgrimize, philosophize, cauterize, anathematize, sympathize, disorganize'', with ''z''; ''rise, arise, disguise, advise, devise, supervise, circumcise, despise, surmise, surprise, comprise, compromise, enterprise, presurmise'', with ''s''. In Commonwealth English spelling, words ending in ''ize'' may also be written with ''ise'', such as ''organise, realise'' and ''recognise''.

''Advertise, catechise, chastise, criticise, exercise, exorcise'', and ''merchandise'' are most commonly written with ''s'' and ''size, assize, capsize, analyze, overprize, detonize'', and ''recognize'', with ''z''.

''Prise'', a thing taken, and ''prize'', to esteem; ''apprise'', to inform, and ''apprize'', to value, or ''appraise'', are often written either way, without this distinction of meaning, which some wish to establish. The want of the foregoing rule has also made many words variable, which ought, unquestionably, to conform to the general principle.

===Compounds===

Compounds generally '''retain the orthography''' of the simple words which compose them: as, ''wherein, horseman, uphill, shellfish, knee-deep, kneedgrass, kneading-trough, innkeeper, skylight, plumtree, mandrill''.

In permanent compounds, or in any derivatives of which, they are not the roots, the words ''full'' and ''all'' drop one ''l'': as, ''handful, careful, fulfil, always, although, withal''; in temporary compounds, they retain both: as, ''full-eyed, chock-full, all-wise, save-all''.

So the prefix ''mis'', (if from miss, to err,) drops one ''s''; but it is wrong to drop them both, as in Johnson's ''mispell'' and ''mispend'', for ''misspell'' and ''misspend''.

In the names of days, the word ''mass'' also drops one ''s'': as, ''Christmas, Candlemas, Lammas''.

The possessive case often drops the apostrophe: as ''herdsman, kitesfoot''.

One letter is dropped, if three of the same kind come together: as, ''Rosshire, chaffinch''; or else a hyphen is used: as, ''Ross-shire, ill-looking, still-life''.

''Chilblain, welcome'', and ''welfare'', drop one ''l''.

''Pastime'' drops an s.

''Shepherd, wherever'', and ''whosever'', drop an ''e''; and ''wherefore'' and ''therefore'' assume one.

===Usage===

Any word for the spelling of which we have no rule but usage, is written wrong if not spelled according to the usage which is most common among the learned: as,

*&quot;The brewer grinds his malt before he brues his beer.&quot;&amp;mdash;Red Book, p. 38.

==Figures of Orthography==

A figure of orthography is an intentional deviation from the ordinary or true spelling of a word.

===Mimesis===

Mimesis is a ludicrous imitation of some mistake or mispronunciation of a word, in which the error is mimicked by a false spelling, or the taking of one word for another: as,

*&quot;Maister, says he, have you any wery good weal in you vallet?&quot;&amp;mdash;Columbian Orator, p. 292.
*&quot;Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, captain Gower.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;I will description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Perdigious! I can hardly stand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lloyd: Brit. Poets, Vol. viii, p. 184.

===Archaism===

An archaism is a word or phrase expressed according to ancient usage, and not according to our modern orthography: as,

*&quot;Newe grene chese of smalle clammynes comfortethe a hotte stomake.&quot;&amp;mdash;T. Paynel: Tooke's Diversions, ii, 132.
*&quot;He hath holpen his servant Israel.&quot;&amp;mdash;Luke, i, 54.
*&quot;With him was reverend contemplation pight, bow-bent with eld, his beard of snowy hue.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.

==Figures of Etymology==

A figure of etymology is an intentional deviation from the ordinary formation of a word.

===Aphaeresis===

Aphaeresis is the elision of some of the initial letters of a word: as, 'gainst, for against; 'gan, for began; 'neath, for beneath; 'thout, for without.

===Prosthesis===

Prosthesis is the prefixing of an expletive syllable to a word: as, ''adown'', for ''down''; ''appaid'', for ''paid''; ''bestrown'', for ''strown''; ''evanished'', for ''vanished''; ''yclad'', for ''clad''.

===Syncope===

Syncope is the elision of some of the middle letters of a word: as, med'cine, for medicine; e'en, for even; o'er, for over; conq'ring, for conquering; se'nnight, for sevennight.

===Apocope===

Apocope is the elision of some of the final letters of a word: as, tho' for though; th', for the; t'other, for the other; thro', for through.

===Paragoge===

Paragoge is the annexing of an expletive syllable to a word: as, ''Johnny'', for ''John''; ''deary'', for ''dear''; ''withouten'', for ''without''.

===Diaeresis===

Diaeresis is the separating of two vowels that might be supposed to form a diphthong: as, ''coöperate'', not ''cooperate''; ''aeronaut'', not ''aeronaut''; ''orthoepy'', not ''orthoepy''.
This used to be common in English but is now rare.

===Synaeresis===

Synaeresis is the sinking of two syllables into one: as, seest, for seest; tacked, for tack-ed; drowned, for drown-ed; 'tis, for it is; I'll, for I will.

===Tmesis===

Tmesis is the inserting of a word between the parts of a compound, or between two words which should be united if they stood together: as,

*&quot;On which side soever.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rolla.
*&quot;To us ward.&quot;
*&quot;To God ward.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bible.
*&quot;The assembling of ourselves together.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;With what charms soever she will.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.
*&quot;So new a fashioned robe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;Lament the live day long.&quot;&amp;mdash;Burns.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dwindrim. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dwindrim~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The '''comma''' is used to separate those parts of a sentence, which are so nearly connected in sense, as to be only one degree removed from that close connection which admits no point.


== Introductory phrases ==

== Appositives ==

Appositives are always separated from the main body of the sentence by punctuation, usually commas, but sometimes&amp;mdash;when greater separation is desired&amp;mdash;dashes are used.

Words in '''apposition''', especially if they have adjuncts, are generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;He that now calls upon you, is Theodore, the hermit of Teneriffe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;Lowth, Dr. Robert, bishop of London, born in 1710, died in 1787.&quot;&amp;mdash;Biog. Dict.
*&quot;Home, Henry, lord Kames.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib.
*&quot;What next I bring shall please you, be assured, your likeness, your fit help, your other self, your wish exactly to your heart's desire.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, P. L., viii, 450.
*&quot;And he, their prince, shall rank among my peers.&quot;&amp;mdash;Byron.

== Parenthetical expressions ==

===Adjectives===

Adjectives, when something depends on them, or when they have the import of a dependent clause, should, with their '''adjuncts''', be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Among the roots of hazel, pendent over the plaintive stream, they frame the first foundation of their domes.&quot;&amp;mdash;Thomson.
*&quot;Up springs the lark, shrill-voiced and loud, the messenger of morn.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.

===Adjective which follows its noun===

When an adjective immediately follows its noun, and is taken in a restrictive sense, the comma should not be used before it: as,

*&quot;And on the coast averse from entrance or cherubic watch.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, P. L., B. ix, l. 68.

===Finite verbs===

Where a finite verb is understood, a comma is generally required: as,

*&quot;From law arises security; from security, curiosity; from curiosity, knowledge.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray.
*&quot;Else all my prose and verse were much the same; this, prose on stilts; that, poetry fallen lame.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===A pause for the omitted verb===

As the semicolon must separate the clauses when the comma is inserted by this rule, if the pause for the omitted verb be very slight, it may be left unmarked, and the comma be used for the clauses: as,

*&quot;When the profligate speaks of piety, the miser of generosity, the coward of valour, and the corrupt of integrity, they are only the more despised by those who know them.&quot;&amp;mdash;Comstock's Elocution, p. 132.

===Infinitives===

The infinitive, when it follows a verb from which it must be separated, or when it depends on something remote or understood, is generally, with its adjuncts, set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;One of the greatest secrets in composition is, to know when to be simple.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jamieson's Rhet., p. 151. [?]
*&quot;To confess the truth, I was much in fault.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 271.
*&quot;The Governor of all&amp;mdash;has interposed, not seldom, his avenging arm, to smite the injurious trampler upon nature's law.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===Participles===

Participles, when something depends on them, when they have the import of a dependent clause, or when they relate to something understood, should, with their adjuncts, be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Law is a rule of civil conduct, prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong.&quot;&amp;mdash;Blackstone: Beattie's Moral Science, p. 346.
*&quot;Young Edwin, lighted by the evening star, lingering and listening wandered down the vale.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.
*&quot;United, we stand; divided, we fall.&quot;&amp;mdash;Motto.
*&quot;Properly speaking, there is no such thing as chance.&quot;

===Participle which follows its noun===

When a participle immediately follows its noun, and is taken in a restrictive sense, the comma should not be used before it: as,

*&quot;A man renowned for repartee, will seldom scruple to make free with friendship's finest feeling.&quot;&amp;mdash;Cowper.

===Adverbs===

Adverbs, when they '''break the connection''' of a simple sentence, or when they have not a close dependence on some particular word in the context, should, with their adjuncts, be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;We must not, however, confound this gentleness with the artificial courtesy of the world.&quot;
*&quot;Besides, the mind must be employed.&quot;&amp;mdash;Gilpin.
*&quot;Most unquestionably, no fraud was equal to all this.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lyttelton.
*&quot;But, unfortunately for us, the tide was ebbing already.&quot;
*&quot;When buttress and buttress, alternately, seem framed of ebon and ivory.&quot;&amp;mdash;Scott's Lay, p. 33.

===Conjunctions===

Conjunctions, when they are separated from the principal clauses that depend on them, or when they introduce examples, are generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;But, by a timely call upon religion, the force of habit was eluded.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;They know the neck that joins the shore and sea, or, ah! how changed that fearless laugh would be.&quot;&amp;mdash;Crabbe.

===Prepositions===

Prepositions and their objects, when they break the connection of a simple sentence, or when they do not closely follow the words on which they depend, are generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Fashion is, for the most part, nothing but the ostentation of riches.&quot;
*&quot;By reading, we add the experience of others to our own.&quot;
*&quot;In vain the sage, with retrospective eye, would from the apparent what conclude the why.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Interjections===

Interjections that require a pause, though more commonly emphatic and followed by the ecphoneme, are sometimes set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north.&quot;&amp;mdash;Jeremiah, i, 15.
*&quot;O, it was about something you would not understand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Columbian Orator, p. 221.
*&quot;Ha, ha! you were finely taken in, then!&quot;&amp;mdash;Aikin.
*&quot;Ha, ha, ha! A facetious gentleman, truly!&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Oh, when shall Britain, conscious of her claim, stand emulous of Greek and Roman fame?&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Words emphatically repeated===

A word emphatically repeated, is generally set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;Happy, happy, happy pair!&quot;&amp;mdash;Dryden.
*&quot;Ay, ay, there is some comfort in that.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;Ah! no, no, no.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dryden.
*&quot;The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, the moss-covered bucket, which hung in the well!&quot;&amp;mdash;Woodworth.

===Dependent quotations===

A quotation, observation, or description, when it is introduced in close dependence on a verb, (as, say, reply, cry, or the like,) is generally separated from the rest of the sentence by the comma: as,

*&quot;'The book of nature,' said he, 'is before you.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Hawkesworth.
*&quot;I say to all, watch.&quot;&amp;mdash;Mark.
*&quot;'The boy has become a man,' means, 'He has grown to be a man.' 'Such conduct becomes a man,' means, 'Such conduct befits him.'&quot;&amp;mdash;Hart's Gram., p. 116.
*&quot;While man exclaims, 'See all things for my use!' 'See man for mine!' replies a pampered goose.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

===Words put absolute===

Nouns or pronouns put '''absolute''', should, with their adjuncts, be set off by the comma: as,

*&quot;The prince, his father being dead, succeeded.&quot;
*&quot;This done, we parted.&quot;
*&quot;Zaccheus, make haste and come down.&quot;
*&quot;His proctorship in Sicily, what did it produce?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cicero.
*&quot;Winged with his fears, on foot he strove to fly, his steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope, Iliad, xi, 440.

== Series ==

===More than two words===

When more than two words or terms are connected in the same construction, or in a '''joint dependence''' on some other term, by conjunctions expressed or understood, the comma should be inserted after every one of them but the last; and, if they are nominatives before a verb, the comma should follow the last also: as,

*&quot;Who, to the enraptured heart, and ear, and eye, teach beauty, virtue, truth, and love, and melody.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.
*&quot;Ah! what avails... all that art, fortune, enterprise, can bring, if envy, scorn, remorse, or pride, the bosom wring?&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible; you, stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;She plans, provides, expatiates, triumphs there.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.
*&quot;So eagerly the fiend over bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, with head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, and swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton.

===Only two words===

When only two words or terms are connected by a conjunction, they should not be separated by the comma: as,

*&quot;It is a stupid and barbarous way to extend dominion by arms; for true power is to be got by arts and industry&quot;&amp;mdash;Spectator, No. 2.
*&quot;Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul.&quot;&amp;mdash;Goldsmith.

===Two words with several adjuncts===

When the '''two words''' connected have several '''adjuncts''', or when one of them has an adjunct that relates not to both, the comma is inserted: as,

*&quot;I shall spare no pains to make their instruction agreeable, and their diversion useful.&quot;&amp;mdash;Spectator, No. 10.
*&quot;Who is applied to persons, or things personified.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bullions.
*&quot;With listless eyes the dotard views the store, he views, and wonders that they please no more.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.

===Contrasted words or phrases===

When two connected words or phrases are '''contrasted''', or emphatically distinguished, the comma is inserted: as,

*&quot;The vain are easily obliged, and easily disobliged.&quot;&amp;mdash;Kames.
*&quot;Liberal, not lavish, is kind nature's hand.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie.
*&quot;It is certain he could write, and cipher too.&quot;&amp;mdash;Goldsmith.

===Alternative of names===

When there is merely an alternative of names, or an explanatory change of terms, the comma is usually inserted: as,

*&quot;We saw a large opening, or inlet.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen.
*&quot;Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles?&quot;&amp;mdash;Cor., ix, 5.

===Understood conjuncrion===

When the conjunction is understood, the comma is inserted; and, if two separated words or terms refer alike to a third term, the second requires a second comma: as,

*&quot;Reason, virtue, answer one great aim.&quot;&amp;mdash;L. Murray, Gram., p. 269.
*&quot;To him the church, the realm, their powers consign.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.
*&quot;She thought the isle that gave her birth. The sweetest, wildest land on earth.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hogg.

===Words in pairs===

When successive words are joined in '''pairs''' by conjunctions, they should be separated in pairs by the comma: as,

*&quot;Interest and ambition, honour and shame, friendship and enmity, gratitude and revenge, are the prime movers in public transactions.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen.
*&quot;But, whether ingenious or dull, learned or ignorant, clownish or polite, every innocent man, without exception, has as good a right to liberty as to life.&quot;&amp;mdash;Beattie's Moral Science, p. 313.
*&quot;Then say how hope and fear, desire and hate, overspread with snares the crowded maze of fate.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

===A compound name===

When several words, in their common order, are used as one compound name, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;Dr. Samuel Johnson,&quot;
*&quot;Publius Gavius Cosanus.&quot;

===United common and proper name===

When a common and a proper name are closely united, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;The brook Kidron,&quot;
*&quot;The river Don,&quot;
*&quot;The empress Catharine,&quot;
*&quot;Paul the Apostle.&quot;

===A mere emphasis and distinction===

When a pronoun is added to an other word merely for emphasis and distinction, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;You men of Athens,&quot;
*&quot;I myself,&quot;
*&quot;You flaming minister,&quot;
*&quot;You princes.&quot;

===Name acquired by action or relation===

When a name acquired by some action or relation, is put in apposition with a preceding noun or pronoun, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;I made the ground my bed;&quot;
*&quot;To make him king;&quot;
*&quot;Whom they revered as God;&quot;
*&quot;With modesty your guide.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

== Clarity ==

===Simple sentences===

A '''simple sentence''' does not, in general, admit the comma: as,

*&quot;The weakest reasoners are the most positive.&quot;&amp;mdash;W. Allen's Gram., p. 202.
*&quot;Theology has not hesitated to make or support a doctrine by the position of a comma.&quot;&amp;mdash;Tract on Tone, p. 4.
*&quot;Then pain compels the impatient soul to seize on promised hopes of instantaneous ease.&quot;&amp;mdash;Crabbe.

===Nominative accompanied by adjuncts===

When the '''nominative''' in a long simple sentence is accompanied by inseparable '''adjuncts''', or when several words together are used instead of a nominative, a comma should be placed immediately before the verb: as,

*&quot;Confession of sin without amendment, obtains no pardon.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn's Reflections, p. 6.
*&quot;To be totally indifferent to praise or censure, is a real defect in character.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Gram., p. 268.
*&quot;O that the tenor of my just complaint, were sculpt with steel in rocks of adamant!&quot;&amp;mdash;Sandys.

===Simple members===

The '''simple members''' of a compound sentence, whether successive or involved, elliptical or complete, are generally divided by the comma: as,

*&quot;Here stand we both, and aim we at the best.&quot;&amp;mdash;Shak.
*&quot;I, that did never weep, now melt in woe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Tide life, tide death, I come without delay.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;I am their mother, who shall bar me from them?&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;How wretched, were I mortal, were my state!&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.
*&quot;Go; while you may, avoid the dreadful fate.&quot;&amp;mdash;Id.
*&quot;Grief aids disease, remembered folly stings, and his last sighs reproach the faith of kings.&quot;&amp;mdash;Johnson.

===Relative that follows its antecedent===

When a relative immediately follows its antecedent, and is taken in a restrictive sense, the comma should not be introduced before it: as,

*&quot;For the things which are seen, are temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal.&quot;&amp;mdash;2 Cor., iv, 18.
*&quot;A letter is a character that expresses a sound without any meaning.&quot;&amp;mdash;St. Quentin's General Gram., p. 3.

===Closely connected simple members===

When the simple members are short, and '''closely connected''' by a '''conjunction''' or a '''conjunctive adverb''', the comma is generally omitted: as,

*&quot;Honest poverty is better than wealthy fraud.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dillwyn's Ref., p. 11.
*&quot;Let him tell me whether the number of the stars be even or odd.&quot;&amp;mdash;Taylor: Joh. Dict., w.
*&quot;It is impossible that our knowledge of words should outstrip our knowledge of things.&quot;&amp;mdash;Campbell: Murray's Gram., p 359.

== Omissions ==

===Simple immediately united members===

When two simple members are immediately united, through '''ellipsis''' of the relative, the antecedent, or the conjunction that, the comma is not inserted: as,

*&quot;Make an experiment on the first man you meet.&quot;&amp;mdash;Berkley's Alciphron, p. 125.
*&quot;Our philosophers do infinitely despise and pity whoever shall propose or accept any other motive to virtue.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p.  126.
*&quot;It is certain we imagine before we reflect.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p. 359.
*&quot;The same good sense that makes a man excel, still makes him doubt he never has written well.&quot;&amp;mdash;Young.

[[Image:tartiflette_and_Fried_Ham.jpg|thumb|212px|A cooked tartiflette and fried ham.]]'''Tartiflette''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French dish]] from the Savoy region. It originated in the valley of Aravis, home of [[Cookbook:Reblochon Cheese|reblochon cheese]]. It is not, however, a traditional dish and was, in fact, invented and launched only in the 1980s by the Reblochon trade union in an attempt to increase sales of the cheese. Different valleys in the region have different methods of producing tartiflette and there is probably more than one recipe per village.  All recipes have potatoes, cheese, and some kind of meat such as slab bacon or salt pork. One example of a recipe is shown below.  

==Ingredients==
*1-3/4 pounds Yukon Gold [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (5 or 6 medium-sized ones, all the same size) or waxy boiling potatoes (Cara also work)
*5 or 6 ounces slab [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], or [[Cookbook:Salt Pork|salt pork]], cut into lardons about 1&quot; x 1/4&quot; by 1/4&quot;
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (about 6 ounces, peeled), finely chopped
*1/4 cup dry [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] or dry [[Cookbook:Vermouth|vermouth]]
*6 tablespoons heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste, probably at least 1/2 teaspoon salt, possibly more
*1/2 of a 1-pound [[Cookbook:Reblochon Cheese|reblochon cheese]]

==Procedure==
[[Image:Tartiflette_in_Preparation.jpg|thumb|212px|A tartiflette with half a Reblochon on it before baking.]]

#Use potatoes that are all the same size so that they will cook evenly. Boil them in their skins for exactly 20 minutes, until they&amp;#8217;re just beginning to get tender.  Do not overcook! Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.
#While still warm, peel the potatoes with your fingers, then use a large, very sharp knife to cut them into slices about 1/3-inch thick.  Then cut the slices into rough cubes.
#While the potatoes are cooking, slice the slab bacon or salt pork into slices about 1/4-inch thick.  Then cut into lardons about 1/4-inch across.
#Melt the butter in a large sauté pan, then cook the lardons over medium-high heat until crisp and golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pan.
#Preheat the oven to 350 °F.
#Cook the onions in the bacon fat over medium heat, stirring often, until wilted and slightly golden. Drain in a strainer, pressing with a spoon to remove as much fat as possible, and leave them there.
#Pour off the fat in the pan, return the bacon and onions, and add the wine.  Cook over high heat until the wine is nearly evaporated.
#Add the diced potatoes and cook for a minute or so, stirring constantly until all the ingredients are well mixed together.
#Add the cream and salt and pepper to taste.  Try using a little more salt than you might think is necessary, at least 1/2 teaspoon.  Stir all the ingredients together for a minute.
#Lightly butter the inside of an 10- or 11-inch earthenware baking dish.  Add the potato mixture and smooth the surface.
#Cut the Reblochon in two down across the top so that you have two pieces in the shape of a half-moon.  Put one of the pieces away for another use. Use a sharp knife to lightly score the crust of the remaining half-cheese about every inch, including its side.  Then carefully slice horizontally through its center so that you now have two half-moon pieces.
#Place the two pieces of cheese crust-side-up on top of the potatoes so that they form a circular cheese again.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour.
#Remove the foil and stir the cheese, including the crust, into the potatoes, mixing well.
#Place 5 or 6 inches under the broiler and cook until golden brown on top.

==Globalization==

==The changing environment==

==America stands alone==

==The Nuclear Age comes full-circle==

==The Rich-Poor Gap==

==Democracy==

After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, and then in the Soviet Union, many people in the West and in the former communist countries hoped that a new era of democracy would emerge. However, at the beginning of the 21st Century, a number of events and developments quelled this euphoria.

First, the increasing authoritarianism in countries like Russia. Since the movement was only in the opposite direction for some time, this came as a surprise to the West. Most of the former communist countries, especially the western ones, have become free countries with a democratic form of government, according to the American watchdog of liberty, Freedom House. However, Russia made an authoritarian turn with the election of prime minister Vladimir V. Putin. As president, Putin has reasserted the authority of the state over parts of the economy and has been accused of suppressing free speech. There are also very few independent media in Russia, that are not directly or indirectly, under Putin's control.

Second, the September 11th attacks on the United States, which killed almost 3,000 people. People were suddenly reminded of the fact that not the entire world had accepted liberal democracy as a good form, or even as an acceptable form of government. (source?) The countries in the Middle-east have had authoritarian governments since the end of colonialism, many of which had Western support. These attacks made painfully clear that there is a lack of freedom and democracy in the Middle-east.

Bernard Lewis, the famed historian of the Middle-east, has long argued in his many books about Islam, that the support that the West has lent to authoritarian and oppressive regimes in the Middle-east has contributed a great deal to Islamic animosity toward the West. Generally, little attention was paid by important policy-makers in the West to his opinions on his matter, and the West continued to support dictators whose only virtue (in the eyes of the West) was that they secured a steady supply of oil for the West. 

After the September 11th attacks, it appeared that president George W. Bush adopted this line of thinking, since he spared Saudi Arabia, where so many of the perpetrators of the attacks came from. However, in many speeches he argued that pushing for democracy in Iraq was one way the West could prevent atrocities such as the ones on September 11th. 

It remains to be seen, if the policies of Bush truly represented a watershed in American policies toward the Middle-east. They might not. President Jimmy Carter adopted tough human rights policies toward countries like Iran, Chile and Nicaragua, but this contributed to the fall of the pro-American shah of Iran and the ascendancy of the virulently anti-American Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had even less respect for human rights and freedoms than the shah. Carter, therefore, failed to leave a permanent imprint on American foreign policy

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Programming/Navigation|next=Functions|previous=The for Loop}}

==The Code==

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
foreach ($array as $someVar) {
  echo ($someVar . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $someVar) {
  echo ($key.&quot; holds the value &quot;.$someVar.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Analysis==

The '''foreach''' loop is a special form of the standard [[Programming:PHP:for_loop|for loop]]. The example above will print all the values of ''$array''. The ''foreach'' structure is a convenient way to loop through an array.

===Simple foreach statement===

Foreach loops are useful when dealing with an array indexed with arbitrary keys (e.g. non-numeric ones):
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$array = array(
  &quot;1st&quot; =&gt; &quot;My House&quot;,
  &quot;2nd&quot; =&gt; &quot;My Car&quot;,
  &quot;3rd&quot; =&gt; &quot;My Lab&quot;
);
&lt;/source&gt;

To use the classical '''for''' structure, you'd have to write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
// get all the array keys
$arrayKeys = array_keys($array);
// get amount of values from array
$count = count($array);
// loop through the keys
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $count; $i++) {
  // get each array value using its key
  echo $array[($arrayKeys[$i])] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Basically, an array value can be accessed only from its key: to make sure you get all the values, you first have to make a list of all the existings keys, then grab all the corresponding values. The access to first array value, the previous example does the following steps:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$firstKey = $arrayKeys[0]; // which is '1st'
$firstValue = $array[$firstKey]; // which is 'My House' ($array('1st'))
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''foreach'' structure does all the groundwork for you:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
foreach ($array as $someVar) {
  echo $someVar . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note how the latter example is easier to read (and write). Both will output:
 My House
 My Car
 My Lab

===foreach with key values===
If you need to use the array's keys in the body of your loop, just add the variable as in the following statement. The phrase '$myKey =&gt; $value' makes the value of the key accessible:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
foreach ($array as $myKey =&gt; $value) {
  // use $myKey
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that this is very usefull when constructing a dropdown list in HTML. You can use a foreach-loop to have the $myKey variable inserted into the value=&quot;...&quot; part and the $value as the actual text.

{{Code:PHPHTML
|This form mimics the way we used custom keys for $array elements. It will not only assign the elements of $array to $someVar, but also assign the keys of those elements to $i.

|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$array = array(&quot;1st&quot; =&gt; &quot;My House&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot; =&gt; &quot;My Car&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot; =&gt; &quot;My Lab&quot;);
foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $someVar) {
  echo $key . &quot;: &quot; . $someVar . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;;
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
 1st: My House&lt;br /&gt;
 2nd: My Car&lt;br /&gt;
 3rd: My Lab&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
 1st: My House
 2nd: My Car
 3rd: My Lab
&lt;/pre&gt;
|
}}

Note that, if you change the assigned variable inside the foreach loop, the change will not be reflected to the array. Therefore, if you need to change elements of the array you need to change them by using the array key. Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$array = array(
  &quot;1st&quot; =&gt; &quot;My House&quot;,
  &quot;2nd&quot; =&gt; &quot;My Car&quot;,
  &quot;3rd&quot; =&gt; &quot;My Lab&quot;
);

foreach ($array as $i =&gt; $someVar) {

  // OK
  if($someVar == 'My Lab') {
    $array[$i] = 'My Laboratory';
  }

  // doesn't update the array
  $someVar = 'Foo';
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=Arrays=

Arrays are sets of data that can be defined in a PHP Script. Arrays can contain other arrays inside of them without any restriction (hence building multidimensional arrays). Arrays can be referred to as tables or hashes.

==Syntax==
Arrays can be created in two ways. The first involves using the function array. The second involves using square brackets.

=== The ''array'' function method ===

In the ''array'' function method, you create an array in the scheme of: &lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$foo = bar()&lt;/source&gt; For example, to up set the array to make the keys sequential numbers (Example: &quot;0, 1, 2, 3&quot;), you use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $foobar = array($foo, $bar);
&lt;/source&gt;

This would produce the array like this: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $foobar[0] = $foo;
 $foobar[1] = $bar;
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also possible to define the key value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $foobar = array('foo' =&gt; $foo, 'bar' =&gt; $bar);
&lt;/source&gt;

This would set the array like this: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $foobar['foo'] = $foo;
 $foobar['bar'] = $bar;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The square brackets method ===

The square brackets method allows you to set up by directly setting the values. For example, to make $foobar[1] = $foo, all you need to do is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $foobar[1] = $foo;
&lt;/source&gt;

The same applies for setting the key value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $foobar['foo'] = $foo;
&lt;/source&gt;


==Examples of Arrays==
===Example #1===
{{Code:PHPHTML
|This example sets and prints arrays.
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
 $array = array(&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Toyota&quot;,&quot;type&quot;=&gt;&quot;Celica&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;=&gt;&quot;black&quot;,&quot;manufactured&quot;=&gt;&quot;1991&quot;);
 $array2 = array(&quot;Toyota&quot;,&quot;Celica&quot;,&quot;black&quot;,&quot;1991&quot;);
 $array3 = array(&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Toyota&quot;,&quot;Celica&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;=&gt;&quot;black&quot;,&quot;1991&quot;);
 print_r($array);
 print_r($array2);
 print_r($array3);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt;
  Array
  (
      [name] =&gt; Toyota
      [type] =&gt; Celica
      [colour] =&gt; black
      [manufactured] =&gt; 1991
  )
  Array
  (
      [0] =&gt; Toyota
      [1] =&gt; Celica
      [2] =&gt; black
      [3] =&gt; 1991
  )
  Array
  (
      [name] =&gt; Toyota
      [0] =&gt; Celica
      [colour] =&gt; black
      [1] =&gt; 1991
  )&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;Array ( [name] =&gt; Toyota [type] =&gt; Celica [colour] =&gt; black [manufactured] =&gt; 1991 ) Array ( [0] =&gt; Toyota [1] =&gt; Celica [2] =&gt; black [3] =&gt; 1991 ) Array ( [name] =&gt; Toyota [0] =&gt; Celica [colour] =&gt; black [1] =&gt; 1991 ) &lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
}}

===Example #2===
The following example will output the identical text as '''[[#Example #1|Example #1]]''':

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $array['name']=&quot;Toyota&quot;;
  $array['type']=&quot;Celica&quot;;
  $array['colour']=&quot;black&quot;;
  $array['manufactured']=&quot;1991&quot;;
  
  $array2[]=&quot;Toyota&quot;;
  $array2[]=&quot;Celica&quot;;
  $array2[]=&quot;black&quot;;
  $array2[]=&quot;1991&quot;;
  
  $array3['name']=&quot;Toyota&quot;;
  $array3[]=&quot;Celica&quot;;
  $array3['colour']=&quot;black&quot;;
  $array3[]=&quot;1991&quot;;
  
  print_r($array);
  print_r($array2);
  print_r($array3);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example #3===
{{Code:PHPHTML
|Using the ''Example #1'' and '''Example #2''' above, now you can try and use arrays the same way as normal variables:
|&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
 echo &quot;Manufacturer: {$array['name']} \n&quot;;
 echo &quot;Brand: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{$array2['1']}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&quot;;
 echo &quot;Colour: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&quot;.$array3['colour'].&quot;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&quot;;
 echo &quot;Year Manufactured: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&quot;.$array3[1].&quot;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n&quot;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;pre&gt; Manufacturer: &lt;b&gt;Toyota&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Brand: &lt;b&gt;Celica&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Colour: &lt;b&gt;black&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Year Manufactured: &lt;b&gt;1991&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
|
 Manufacturer: '''Toyota'''
 Brand: '''Celica'''
 Colour: '''black'''
 Year Manufactured: '''1991'''
|
}}

==Multidimensional Arrays==
Elements in an array can also be an array, allowing for multidimensional arrays.
An example, in accordance with the motoring examples above, is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cars = array(
   &quot;car1&quot; =&gt; array(&quot;make&quot; =&gt; &quot;Toyota&quot;,&quot;colour&quot; =&gt; &quot;Green&quot;,&quot;year&quot; =&gt; 1999,&quot;engine_cc&quot; =&gt; 1998),
   &quot;car2&quot; =&gt; array(&quot;make&quot; =&gt; &quot;BMW&quot;,&quot;colour&quot; =&gt; &quot;RED&quot;,&quot;year&quot; =&gt; 2005,&quot;engine_cc&quot; =&gt; 2400),
   &quot;car3&quot; =&gt; array(&quot;make&quot; =&gt; &quot;Renault&quot;,&quot;colour&quot; =&gt; &quot;White&quot;,&quot;year&quot; =&gt; 1993,&quot;engine_cc&quot; =&gt; 1395),
);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, if you were to use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
echo &quot;$cars['car1']['make']&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;$cars['car3']['engine_cc']&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The output would be:
 Toyota&lt;br /&gt;
 1395

==Array Functions==
There are dozens of array manipulation functions. Before implementing your own, make sure it doesn't already exist as a PHP function in [http://php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php Array functions (PHP manual entry)].

==Array traversal==
In various circumstances, you will need to visit every array element and perform a task upon it.

The simplest and the most widely used method for this is the '''[[Programming:PHP:foreach_loop|foreach]]''' operator that loops through the whole array and works individually with each key/item couple. If a more complex way of traversing the array is needed, the following functions operate using the internal array pointer:

* ''reset'' - sets the internal pointer to the first element and returns the first element
* ''prev'' - sets the internal pointer to the previous element and returns it
* ''current'' - returns the current element; does not change the internal pointer
* ''next'' - sets the internal pointer to the next element and returns it
* ''each'' - returns the current element; then sets the internal pointer to the next element
* ''end'' - sets the internal pointer to the last element and returns the last element

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
// using an array's iterator to print its values in reverse order
$my_array = array('a', 'b', 'c');
end($my_array);
while($i = current($my_array)) {
	echo $i.&quot;\n&quot;;
	prev($my_array);
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Another possibility is defining a function and applying it to each array element via one of the following functions:

* ''array_walk'' - applies a function to each array element
* ''array_walk_recursive'' - same, but if the element is itself an array, it will traverse that array too

I agree, but I think that it is of secondary importance. This is a php book. There already exists an [[Programming:XHTML|XHTML]] wikibook. I will personally keep in xhtml compliance, and correct where I catch it, but right now our emphasis needs to be on developing the php book content.

It's a wiki. You can concentrate on writing the narrative and let other people clean up the code after you've done the hard work. If you don't like their changes, change 'em back! --[[User:Munin|Munin]] 12:01, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</text>

Many individuals feel that their cooking should reflect their ethics.  Note that these ethics are not necessarily universal, and the chef is free to decide which of these is important.  Note also that in some cases the efficacy in achieving these goals (such as gathering wild food to avoid buying farmed food) is questionable, or may even run counter to your goals.  If you decide you care about these issues, it is up to you to research them.

:1. Treatment of animals
::* Eat free range meat and eggs only
::* Buy dolphin-free tuna
::* Don't eat any animals (vegetarianism)
::* Don't eat any animals or animal products including milk, eggs, and honey (veganism)

:2. Sustainability
::*Eat only local food
::*Eat only seasonal food
::*Eat only &quot;organic&quot; food
::*Eat only fish not on the red list
::*When buying food that is not local buy only &quot;fair trade&quot; food
::*Don't buy food with a lot of packaging
::*Use a reusable bag when shopping
::*Only eat food you hunted or gathered yourself

:3. Consideration of guests
::*Consider your guests' dietary needs and habits
::*When uncertain, ask about your guests' allergies
::*Try not to get hair, oil, saliva, tears, fingertips, or other parts of yourself in the food.

* The golden rule applies to cooking:
: &quot;Cook for others the way you'd like others to cook for you.&quot;

Quick, simple, refreshing. Just like a salad should be.

Use fresh, young broad beans. If you can't find them soft enough to eat raw, cook in boiling water for the shortest time possible, and rinse in cold.

== Ingredients ==
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*[[Cookbook:Broad Bean|broad beans]]
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

It is impossible to list exact quantities, since it all depends on how much peas you extract from the beans.

== Procedure ==
# Peel the broad beans, and discard any nasty looking peas.
# Chop tomatoes to cubed, about a cm thick. The volume of chopped tomatoes should be roughly twice that of the peas. 
# Chop onion(s) very thinly. The amount depends on how spicy you like your salad.
# Mix it all together, then sprinkle salt and olive oil generously.

'''Broad beans''' are large [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|fava beans]], common in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|English]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]], and [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern]] cuisines. They are eaten green in England, either green or dried elsewhere.

== Seasonality ==

{{Seasonality|Broad Beans|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|1|1|1|1|1}}

Broad bean plants started under glass or over-wintered in a protected location are ready for harvest in mid-spring. For normal crops the season starts at the end of spring and lasts through the summer. As the season progresses the beans grow larger and tougher and become encased in a thick outer skin, which is usually removed before cooking. 

Out of season, broad beans are usually available jarred, canned or frozen.

----

A - Knight&lt;br&gt;
B - Spy&lt;br&gt;
C - Knave

== Reasoning ==

B is not the knight, since if he is, then A would also be the knight.

C is not the knight, since his statement would then be a lie.  Therefore A is the knight.

Hence C is the knave, and B is the spy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Umm...you sure a &quot;double-stop&quot; can be played on a piano? --[[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] 07:07, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)



Yup - if a double stop is simply playing two notes at the same time, you just push down two keys on the piano.... hey presto, a double stop! Dave

: Double stopping doesn't just mean two notes played at the same time. On guitar, double stopping means holding down (stopping) two strings onto the fretboard at any position (except open) in order to produce a 'dyad' or 'interval' when the strings are played. Double stopping doesn't apply to piano playing.

::And if it did just mean playing two notes at the same time, it certainly wouldn't be restricted to string instruments (xylophones, bagpipes, pipe organs, and harmonicas are just a few non-string instruments that can play more than one note at a time). [[User:151.200.237.145|151.200.237.145]] 04:36, 8 May 2007 (UTC)

::I would agree here.  Double stopping only happens when ONE string is stopped in two placed, if done correctly, you amplify certain harmonics and produce a two-tone effect.  This is not the same as just plucking two strings at once. (stestagg) [[User:86.140.72.186|86.140.72.186]] 21:30, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

== Incorrect pronunciation? ==

By following the rules for manipulating rhymes to pronounce them,
don't we get for example that yin is pronounced without the initial y sound,
which is not accurate?  (yi doesn't have an initial y sound, but yin does.)
similarly, we would not have an initial w sound for wu, which it does have.

It is also confusing/wrong to define the initial as the non-vowels at the beginning
and then say some syllables have no initial, when all syllables have a non-vowel
seciton at the beginning.  Perhaps define the initial as what you get after manipulating
the non-vowel section at the beginning.

:*I updated table and lists to reflect versions in Wikipedia [[w:pinyin|pinyin]] articles.  This includes removing w and y from the list of initials and rearranaging list to &quot;conventional&quot; pinyin order.  Also added a bit of explanation when y and w are used.  Hope that helps...  -- [[User:Murdocke| Murdocke]] January 10, 2005 09:27 UTC

== Quick note to author(s): ==

Could use explanations of the use of accents in pinyin to illustrate tones.

: I have added a small section on tones and some text examples.  Like the comment below suggests, it would be cool to have links to a Mandarin speaker demonstrating the tones.

Audio files would be cool (can we do that yet?)

Why isn't this lesson 1?  Learning the structure etc counts as a lesson to me.

Also, I need a login.

== Audio samples? ==

I've started following the course, but I've got some problems with the pronunciation part.
I've got no chance of visiting China in the near future to meet a native speaker, English isn't my native language and the descriptions of mouth and tongue positions are also Chinese to me.

In short, it would be really helpful if you could provide some example sound files... [[User:Azertus|Azertus]] 20:44, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:I'm sure everyone envisages some sort of audio integration in the future, especially for the pinyin lessons, but we're not there yet. [[Chinese: Fundamentals of the language]] really needs a ton of work and audio samples before anyone could learn good pronunciation from it, but there are already some sites further along. 

:If you don't have any Chinese friends that could help you, [http://www.csulb.edu/~txie/ccol/content.htm Conversational Chinese Online] has a good guide. You could also look for language tapes or CDs at your library to get the pronunciation. -[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 02:35, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Third tone duration ==

It's been my observation (for English speakers), that third tone also has the characteristic of lengthing the vowel sound, similar to Sanskrit / Hindi short and long matras (vowels). I'm just a beginner in learning Chinese and I don't claim this is academically &quot;correct&quot; or proven, however.&lt;br&gt; 
I've never seen this pointed out on any pronunciation site, but the &quot;trick&quot; always works when I show it to others. If I pronounce a vowel as 2-3 times a regular vowel sound, it gets heard as third tone, even when I keep the tone as flat as possible. 14:41, 3 October 2005 (UTC) Stephan Hodges

:I was also told to do this by my Chinese 101 instructor. And now that I look, there isn't much explanation of the tone pronunciation on the Tones page. I'll add the missing paragraph, including your useful hint. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 07:25, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

== Help! ==

I've been studying Chinese for about a month and have looked at many descriptions of pronunciation, but this page is way more confusing than anything I've seen.  I don't understand the value of (i.e., need for) the initials and finals, am overwhelmed by the sheer mass of material here, and on top of it all, what software do you need to play an OGG file?  Thank you.  [[User:Alan Nicoll|Alan Nicoll]] 00:18, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

More whining:  if this is meant to be part of a textbook for beginners, it will scare away more users than it will help.  It's put together like the ultimate reference to Mandarin pronunciation, not the user-friendly introduction that beginners need.  Also, some of my characters are showing up as boxes, which is warned about, but how does one go about fixing the problem?  [[User:Alan Nicoll|Alan Nicoll]] 00:29, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

I live in Oklahoma City and run my own computer support business.  I specialize in the IBM AS400/iSeries, but also program in Visual Basic, Perl, PHP, Javascript, manage Linux systems, and do webpage and networking support.  I've been at this for over twenty years (my first computer was a Heathkit and my first programming language was Fortran).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The aims of this option are to provide the opportunity to study some important mathematical concepts, and introduce the principles of proof through abstract algebra. For this topic, you do not need any background knowledge of a core topic.

== Naive Set Theory ==
Sets can be used as a foundation for constructing all the rest of mathematics.  This is called '''axiomatic set theory'''.  But axiomatic set theory is a very formal theory, too cumbersome for everyday mathematical use.  On the other hand, sets are too useful a mathematical construct to be reserved for specialists investigating the foundations of mathematics.  Naive set theory refers to using the framework of sets without formally defining them.  This in what we will be doing.

=== A set is defined (informally) as any collection of things ===

Ex: The set of primary colors, the set of my siblings, the set of positive integers.

=== Some sets can be described by listing the things in them ===

We list the things separated by commas, and use curly braces to indicate that the belong to a set.

Ex: {red, yellow, blue}, {Donna, Linda, Bobbi, Julie, Steve}

If we can completely list (enumerate) all the things in a set, the set is said to be '''finite'''.  The set of primary colors and the set of my siblings are finite sets.  If a set isn’t finite, it is said to be '''infinite'''.  The set of all positive integers is an infinite set.

=== Some sets can be described by a rule for enumerating them ===

The set of positive even integers is infinite, so we can’t list them all.  But, we can write it as {2, 4, 6, …}.  The “…” says that there is a rule for constructing a list that contains every member of the set, even though the list can't be completed in a finite amount of time.

Problem:

1. Explicitly state a rule for constructing the set of positive even integers.

An interesting aside: some infinite sets are so “big” that it isn't possible to write a rule that constructs a list of all its members.  The set of real numbers is one such set.

=== Some common mathematical sets ===

Here are some common mathematical sets you are familiar with.  You need to be able to recognize the symbols.
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of positive integers and zero, &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of integers
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^+&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of positive integers, &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of rational numbers 
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^+&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of positive rational numbers
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of real numbers 
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of positive real numbers
;&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;
:the set of complex numbers

=== The “things” in a set are called ''elements'' of the set ===

If something (say “x”) is in some particular set (say “S”), we say “x is an '''element''' of S.”  To say this concisely, we write 

:&lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematicians often use the word '''member''' as a synonym for '''element'''.  For example, you’ll hear things like “2 is a member of the set of positive integers”.

=== Definition of equality for sets === 

Two sets S and T are equal if every element of S is also an element of T and every element of T is also an element of S.  Not surprisingly, we write this as

:&lt;math&gt;S \mathbf= T&lt;/math&gt;
	 
Here are some implications of this definition.

'''The ordering of elements in a set is not important'''

The set {red, yellow, blue} equals (i.e. is the same as) the set {yellow, blue, red}.  Why?  Look at the definition of equality.  Every element in the first set is an element of the second, and every element in the second set is an element of the first.  So the two sets are equal.

'''Something is either an element of a set or not; it doesn’t make any difference if you list it multiple times'''

The set {red, red, yellow, blue, red} is the same as (i.e. is equal to) the set {red, yellow, blue}, even though “red” is listed multiple times in the first set.  Don’t take my word for it; check the definition of equals.

=== Definition of subsets ===

What would happen if we broke up the definition of equal sets into its two parts?
Suppose we required only that every element of S is also an element of T, without requiring the “vice versa”?  For example, every element of the set {red, yellow, blue} is in the set {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple}, but not vice versa.  This kind of thing happens often enough that we give it a name.  We say that S is a '''subset''' of T if every element of S is also an element of T.  To say this concisely, we write

:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt;

Not surprisingly, we’ll also make up a definition for the “vice versa” part.  That is, we say that S is a '''superset''' of T if every element of T is an element of S.  We write this as

:&lt;math&gt;S \supseteq T&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the similarity between the symbols &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt;, which are defined for sets, and &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt;, which are defined for numbers.  This is not an accident.  The subset relation between sets is not the same thing as the less-than-or-equal relation between the integers, but the two relations do have many similarities.  (How many can you think of?)  Good mathematical notation will often be suggestive of such similarities.

Problems:

1) Is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N\supseteq\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;?  Is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z \supseteq\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;? Is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z \subseteq\mathbb Z^+ &lt;/math&gt;? Is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z\subseteq\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;?

2) If S, T and U are sets with 
:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; 
and
:&lt;math&gt;T \subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;, 
what can you say about the relationship between S and U?  Show it using the definition of &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;.  Do you remember what this property is called?

3) Put as many as you can of the common mathematical sets listed above into a single order of subsets, that is 
:? &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ? &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ? &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; …

=== The relationship between subsets, supersets and equality ===

Reviewing the definitions, we see that for two sets &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;S \mathbf= T&lt;/math&gt; 

is true whenever both

:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \supseteq T&lt;/math&gt;

are true.

1) What is the analogous statement for &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; with respect to real numbers?  Is this statement true?

2) For x and y in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;, either x &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; y or x &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; y.  Does the same hold true for &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\supseteq&lt;/math&gt; with respect to sets?

=== “Proper” subsets ===

Sometimes we have &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; and we want to rule out the possibility that &lt;math&gt;S \mathbf= T&lt;/math&gt;.  To do this, we write

:&lt;math&gt;S \subset T&lt;/math&gt;
	 
i.e. we omit the bar below the &lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;.  To say this in words, we say that S is a proper subset of T.  The use of the word “proper” here is kind of funny.  It doesn’t mean that there is something more accurate, or more polite, about being a proper subset.  It is just the term that mathematicians have come to use to avoid having to say, “S is a subset of T  but it isn’t equal to T.”
Similarly, 
	  
:&lt;math&gt;S \supset T&lt;/math&gt;
	 
is read “S is a proper superset of T ” and is a shorter way of writing

:&lt;math&gt;S \supseteq T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S \neq T&lt;/math&gt;
 
Problems:

1. For any set S, which of the following are true? 

:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \subset S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \mathbf= S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \supseteq S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \supset S&lt;/math&gt;

 
2. Suppose S = {2, 4, 6}.  For each of the following sets T, list all the relationships that hold between S and T .

:T = {6, 4, 2}
:T = {2, 4, 4}
:T = {2, 6, 10}
:T = {2, 4, 6, 10}
:T = {1, 3, 5}

=== The smallest possible set === 

Is there a set X that is a subset of every possible set S?  Yes.  We can have a set with no elements at all.  The definition of subset says that X is a subset of S if every element of X is also an element of S.  If X has no elements, this statement is true regardless of what elements S contains.

We call the set containing no elements the null set.  It sometimes is written as

:{ }

but more often we write it as 

:&lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;

Again, note the similarity between the notations for the set &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; and the number 0.  Just as &lt;math&gt;0 \le n&lt;/math&gt; for any natural number n, &lt;math&gt;\empty \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt; for any set S.

=== Combining sets: union and intersection === 

So far, we have defined various relations on pairs of sets &lt;math&gt;(=,  \subset, \subseteq, &lt;/math&gt;etc.) in terms of membership.  It is also useful to define operations that take two sets and form a third set.
Once again, we will define these operations in terms of membership.

We’ll start by defining the '''intersection''' of two sets S and T to be the set containing anything that is ''both'' an element of S ''and'' an element of T.  We’ll write the intersection operation as

:&lt;math&gt;S \cap T&lt;/math&gt;
	 
Similarly, we’ll define the '''union''' of two sets S and T to be the set containing anything that is ''either'' an element of S ''or'' an element of T.  We’ll write the union operation as
	 
:&lt;math&gt;S \cup T&lt;/math&gt;
	 
If you have any trouble getting mixed up between &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;, try remembering that &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;looks like U, which stands for Union.

Problems:

1. If  S = {1, 2, 3} and T = {2, 3, 4}, what is &lt;math&gt;S \cap T&lt;/math&gt;? What is &lt;math&gt;S \cup T&lt;/math&gt;?

2. Are the following statements true for ''any'' sets S and T?

:&lt;math&gt;S = (S\cap S)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq (S\cup S)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \subseteq (S\cup T)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \subset (S\cap T)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \supset (S\cup T)&lt;/math&gt;

Is so, explain why.  If not, give a counter-example.

=== Venn diagrams === 

When doing math, it is often useful to draw a picture to help visualize a  problem.  For elementary set operations, there is a conventional method of drawing pictures called Venn diagrams, named after the British mathematician John Venn.  To draw a set S, we simply draw a circle, with the name of the set inside the circle.

:[[Image:Trivial_Venn_Diagram.png]]
	 
The intent of this drawing is that the inside of the circle represents all the elements in S.  The outside of the circle represents everything that isn’t in the set S.
There isn’t any significance to the fact that we use circles in Venn diagrams.  We could just as well draw

:[[ Image:Trivial_Elliptical_Venn_Diagram.PNG]] or [[Image:Trivial Pentagonal Venn Diagram]]
 
Now, to represent an operation on two sets, we draw two overlapping circles, like this:

:[[Image:Simple Venn Diagram]]
	 
If you have colored pencils, you could color the inside of S red and the inside of T blue, like this:

:[[Image:Colored Simple Venn Diagram]]
	 
We can now describe all the area that is colored as .  The purple overlap between the circles represents  .
If you don’t have colored pencils, you can draw the circles and shade in the area you want to describe.  For example, you can draw something like
	 
to represent  .  To represent  , you would shade in only the overlap of the two circles.  (I would show this, but the word processor I am using to write this can’t do this easily.)
If we never combined more than two sets, Venn diagrams wouldn’t be useful enough to bother learning about.  But they are very useful when we want to illustrate relationships between three sets.  In this case, we draw three overlapping circles, like this:
	 
Problems:
Illustrate the following set operations by drawing 3 overlapping circles for S, T and U and then shading in only the area described

 
 
 
 
 
 

Once we get more than three sets, Venn diagrams aren’t so useful.  The problem is that we can’t simply draw four circles that show every possible combination of intersections.  So Venn diagrams are mostly an introductory learning tool.
Problems:
Draw a Venn diagram (not limited to circles) that depicts every possible combination of intersections between four sets.  What is the best you can do?

=== Set complement (first try) === 

There is one more operation we want to define for sets – the complement.  This operation is a unary operation, meaning it takes only one set as an argument.  (Intersection and union are called binary operations, because they take two sets as arguments.)
The idea behind the complement of a set S is that it should contain exactly those elements that the set S doesn’t contain.  We’ll write the complement of S as
	S′
(Another notation that you’ll often see is .)
Thus, we might try to define the complement of S as “the set of all elements that are not elements of  S”.  For example, if S were the set of odd integers, than the complement of S would include all the even integers.  But according to our definition, the complement of S would also contain my sister Donna, the color red and Valentine’s Day, since they aren’t in S either.  So the complement is going to have all kinds of useless junk in it.  If this were an everyday discourse, we could just dismiss the junk as being irrelevant to our conversation and ignore it.  But in mathematics, we like to be more precise than that.  Our solution will be to introduce the notion of a “universal set”.

=== Universal set === 
A set consisting of all elements under consideration is called the universal set.It is usually by the capital English Letter U.
The universal set is simply the set of all things that we are currently talking about.  The name “universal set” is misleading.  It is not a set that contains everything in the universe.  Nor is it universal in the sense that everyone has agreed to use it.  Perhaps a better term would be “universe of discourse”.  If we are making statements about the real numbers, then we say our universal set is the set of real numbers.  If, on the other hand, we were discussing the natural numbers, our universe of discourse would be the set of all natural numbers.
Another way to think of this is with a Venn diagram.  We can draw the set S as
	 
where the shaded area represents the elements in S.  But how would we shade the diagram to represent the complement of  S?  We would want to shade the outside of the circle.  But where would we stop?  A “little ways” out?  To the edge of the paper?  Maybe the back of the paper as well?
The universal set makes it clear where to stop:
	 

Keep in mind that the only reason for defining a universal set is to remove ambiguity when we’re taking a set complement.  If we’re not going to be using set complements, we don’t need to worry about what our universal set is.

=== Set complement (the real thing) ===

Now that we have the concept of a universal set, we’ll give the real definition for set complement: The complement of a set T is the set of all elements that are in the universal set but not in T.
Problems:
Assume that R, S, and T are subsets of some universal set U. Draw Venn Diagrams to determine whether the following statements are always true.

 
 
 
 
 

(You had this last problem before, in the section titled Combining sets: union and intersection.  Did you get the same answer this time?  If not, did the Venn diagram mislead you? You have to be careful when interpreting Venn diagrams with proper subsets.)

=== DeMorgan’s laws === 

In mathematics, the term “law” describes a statement that can be proved from more fundamental mathematics.  There are a number of synonyms: postulate, theorem, corollary, etc.  The term “law” is often used in conjunction with statements that were discovered a long time ago, typically before that area of mathematics was formalized.
DeMorgan’s laws, named after Augustus De Morgan, are
	 
and
	 
Note the symmetry between these two statements.  If you take one and interchange the   and  , you get the other.
DeMorgan’s laws are important because they provide a method for moving the complement from the “outside” to the “inside” of a complex expression.  By applying DeMorgan’s laws repeatedly, we can transform any complex expression containing complements into an equivalent expression that has only complements of simple sets.
Ex:
	 
	 
	 
	 
In the last step, we made use of the fact that taking the complement a second time returns us to the original set, i.e. for any set S, 
	 
Problems:
Use Venn diagrams to show that DeMorgan’s laws are true.
Use DeMorgan’s laws to transform these expressions into equivalent expressions that have complements only of basic sets.

 
 
 
=== Other useful laws === 

There are numerous laws relating various combinations of intersection, union and complement operations.  Laws of the form X = Y are especially useful because we can use them for translating an expression into other, equivalent expressions.  Here are some useful laws of this having this form.  To the right of each law is a verbal description.
	 			union is commutative
	 			intersection is commutative
When operations are commutative, we don’t have to be concerned about the order of the operands.
	 		union is associative
	 		intersection is associative
When operations are associative, we can remove unnecessary parentheses.  For example, we can write   because there is no difference between   and  .
 	intersection distributes over union
This is analogous to the fact that for real numbers, multiplication distributes over addition.  That is,  .  If we exchange   for * and   for +, we get the law above.
Notice also that union does not distribute over intersection, such as addition does not distribute over multiplication for real numbers.
The next two laws include U, the universal set.
	 				law of the excluded middle
This is called the law of the excluded middle because any element in the universal set either is an element of S or isn’t an element of S.  There is no middle ground.
	 				universal set is an identity for intersection
This says that taking the intersection with the universal set makes no change, just as multiplying a real number by 1 makes no change.
Problems:
Verify each of the above laws using Venn diagrams.

=== Union-of-intersections form === 

A good start in determining how two set expressions are related is to reduce them both to union-of-intersections form.  This is an expression of the form
	(? ? … ?) (? ? … ?) (? ? … ?) … (? ? … ?)
where all the question marks are either a named set or its complement.  For example, the expression
	 
is in union-of-intersections form.  This is analogous to the sum-of-products form for expressions over R, such as
 
or, following the common conventions for omitting multiplication symbols and extra parentheses,
 
Question: What mathematical properties and/or notational conventions are needed to get the previous line from the one before it?
Here’s a general technique for transforming any set expression into union-of-intersections form, 
Apply DeMorgan’s laws repeatedly to move all complements to named sets.
Apply the distributive law repeatedly to change intersection of unions into unions of intersections.
Make free use the associative laws to get rid of unnecessary parentheses and the commutative laws to put things in a nice order.
Here’s a simple example.
	 
	 
	 
(I had originally intended to take this topic farther, that is to develop a complete algorithm for deciding whether two set expressions were equivalent (or had a subset relationship).  But I decided it was going to get into too many details, so I’m just going to stop here.
Problems:
Determine whether each of the following relationships is always true. Start by transform both sides of the expression into union-of-intersections form.

 
 
=== Sets of sets === 

At the beginning of this topic, I said that sets could be used for constructing all of mathematics.  This is possible because the elements of sets can be sets themselves.
For example, consider the set S = {1, {1}, {1, {1}}}.  This set has three elements, the number 1, the set {1}, and the set {1, {1}}. 
When dealing with sets of sets, it is important not to get confused between a element of the set and a subset of the set.  For example, if S = {1, {1}, {1, {1}}}, then the number 1 is an element of S, and not a subset of S.  On the other hand, the set {1} is both an element of S and a subset of S.  How can this be?  Let me write each of the elements of S in a different color.
	S = {1, {1}, {1, {1}}}
Now {1} is clearly an element of  S.  But in addition, {1} is a subset of S, but for a different reason.
Questions:
Is the set {1, {1}} an element of S?  A subset of S?
Problems:
Is the set {1, {1, {1}}} an element of S?  A subset of S?
How many subsets does the set S have? List them.
Suppose we start with nothing but the null set, Ø.  If that is the only thing in the mathematical universe, what other sets could we possibly build out of it?  There is only one possibility, and that is to put it into a set, i.e. {Ø}.  Is Ø really different than {Ø}?  How many elements does Ø have.  How many elements does {Ø} have?
So now we have two sets,  Ø and {Ø}.  What new sets can we build from these?  Well, one possibility would be to have a set containing only {Ø}, that is {{Ø}}.  (The sets {{Ø}} and {Ø} each have just one element; how can we be sure that they aren’t the same set?  Hint: use the definition of set equality.)  But from Ø and {Ø}, we can also build the set (Ø, {Ø}}.  This is clearly a new set, because it has two elements – our biggest set yet!
Problems:
How many new sets can you build by making sets of the four sets we know about so far, i.e. Ø, {Ø}, {{Ø}} and (Ø, {Ø}}?  List them.
Make up a procedure that will take any set (including the null set) and produce a new (different) set.
Starting with the null set, write the first 6 sets your procedure produces if you repeatedly apply it to the previously produced set.
Will your procedure ever produce the same set a second time?  If so, write a second procedure that never repeats.  If your first procedure never repeats, write a second one that does.
Constructing the natural numbers from sets
It probably will come as a surprise to you, but you constructed the natural numbers in the previous problem set!  You probably didn’t recognize them because you wrote them in an unfamiliar notation.  But how we write (or pronounce) numbers doesn’t have any effect on their meaning.  In English, we say “zero, one, two, three, …” while in French, we say “zéro, un, deux, trois, …”, but the numbers aren’t any different.  Similarly , we could use different mathematical notations, say 0, 1, 2, 3, … or  &lt;nothing&gt;, I, II, III, …, and the underlying numbers themselves wouldn’t be any different.  What is important is what properties the numbers have.  For the natural numbers, the important properties are:
For any n N, there is a function (we’ll call it a “successor” function and write it as  succ) whose value is another natural number.
There is a single n N that is not the successor of any other natural number.  We’ll call this number “zero” and write it as “0”.
For any n N that isn’t 0, there is only one m N such that n = succ(m).
That’s it. Any set of objects satisfying those properties is essentially the natural numbers.  (Later, we’ll get more precise about what we mean as “essentially”.)  Everything else you know about the natural numbers (the properties of addition, multiplication, …) follow as a natural consequence.  Cool, huh?  We’re not going to actually show this right now, but we will later in the Discrete Math topic.

=== Russell’s paradox === 

Russell’s paradox, named after philosopher/mathematician Bertrand Russell is the standard example of how naïve set theory can get into trouble by accepting anything as a set.  To see this, let’s let our universal set U be the set of all sets, and we’ll consider those sets that don’t contain themselves as members.
(Interlude: None of the sets we have seen so far contain themselves as members.  In fact, it isn’t possible for a finite set to contain itself as a member.  But what about the infinite set
	Ц = …{{{{{{ Ø }}}}}}…
This is an infinite set, the limit of the sequence Ø, { Ø }, {{ Ø }}, {{{ Ø }}}, … .  Every set in this sequence has only one element.  In the case of Ц, it’s element is
	…{{{{{{ Ø }}}}}}…
which is just Ц.  So 
Ц  Ц
which is to say that Ц contains itself. End of interlude.)
Let’s call sets that don’t contain themselves to be “reasonable” sets.  Clearly, there are lots of reasonable sets.  We’ll define R to be the set of all the reasonable sets.  (You can’t get much more reasonable than that. )  So  .
But it turns out that R embodies a contradiction.  To see this, ask yourself the question 
Is R a reasonable set?”
If your answer is “yes”, then R contains R  because we defined R as the set of all reasonable sets.  On the other hand, R does not contain R by the definition of reasonable.
It doesn’t do any good to answer “no” to the question.  You’ll still conclude both that R contains R  and R does not contain R.
Axiomatic set theory resolves this paradox by being more careful about defining what a set is.  It turns out that the “set of all sets” is not something that can be constructed in axiomatic set theory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two atoms are walking down the street. The first atom says to the second atom &quot;I think I lost an electron!&quot; The second says &quot;Are you sure?&quot; To which the first states &quot;I'm '''positive'''!&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Basic Understanding ==

; Conductors : Materials which contain movable charges that can flow with minimal resistance.

; Insulators : Materials with few or no movable charges, or with charges which flow with extremely high resistance.

; Semiconductors : Materials whose behavior ranges between that of a conductor and that of an insulator under different conditions. Their conducting behavior may be heavily dependent on temperature. They are useful because we are able to change their conducting behavior to be dependent on many other factors.

; The Atom : An atom contains a positively charged nucleus and one or more negatively charged electrons.  The atom exists in three states: neutral, positively charged, and negatively charged.  A neutral atom has the same number of electrons and protons, a positively charged atom has more protons than electrons and a negatively charged atom has more electrons than protons.

; (+) and (-) Ions : An ion is an atom that has an unequal number of electrons and protons. Ions are formed when a neutral atom gains or loses electrons during a chemical reaction. In a battery, the positive side has + ions, means there are fewer electrons than protons, giving it an overall positive charge, and -ve side, more electrons than protons, giving it an overall negative charge. +ve and -ve charge will attract each other, and it is the use of such an attractive force that allows the battery to do work.

Note: Electric current is not the same as electron flow as is widely mistaken. Firstly, the total current has the opposite direction compared to electron flow. This is a lucky &quot;mistake&quot; on our forefathers' part to put it this way. It is also because of this lucky legacy that we are reminded that electricity can flow in materials other than metals alone. For example, in water, it is not electrons that flow, it is ions, and the +ve ions and -ve ions flow in opposite directions, contributing half of the total current each.

==Balance of Charge==

Atoms, the smallest particles of matter that retain the properties of the matter, are made of [[wikipedia:protons|protons]], [[wikipedia:electrons|electrons]], and [[wikipedia:neutrons|neutrons]]. '''Protons''' have a positive charge, '''Electrons''' have a negative charge that cancels the proton's positive charge. '''Neutrons''' are particles that are similar to a proton but have a neutral charge. There are no differences between positive and negative charges except that particles with the same charge '''repel''' each other and particles with opposite charges '''attract''' each other. If a solitary positive proton and negative electron are placed near each other they will come together to form a hydrogen atom. This repulsion and attraction (force between stationary charged particles) is known as the''' Electrostatic Force''' and extends theoretically to infinity, but is diluted as the distance between particles increases. 

When an atom has one or more missing electrons it is left with a '''positive''' charge, and when an atom has at least one extra electron it has a '''negative''' charge. Having a positive or a negative charge makes an atom an '''ion'''. Atoms only gain and lose protons and neutrons through [[w:Nuclear_fusion|fusion]], [[w:Nuclear_fission|fission]], and [[w:Radioactive_decay|radioactive decay]]. Although atoms are made of many particles and objects are made of many atoms, they behave similarly to charged particles in terms of how they repel and attract.

In an '''atom''' the protons and neutrons combine to form a tightly bound nucleus. This nucleus is surrounded by a vast cloud of electrons circling it at a distance but held near the protons by electromagnetic attraction (the electrostatic force discussed earlier). The cloud exists as a series of overlapping '''shells / bands''' in which the inner '''valence''' bands are filled with electrons and are tightly bound to the atom. The outer '''conduction''' bands contain no electrons except those that have accelerated to the conduction bands by gaining energy. With enough energy an electron will escape an atom (compare with the escape velocity of a space rocket). When an electron in the conduction band decelerates and falls to another conduction band or the valence band a photon is emitted.  This is known as the '''photoelectric effect'''.

A '''laser''' is  formed when electrons travel back and forth between conduction bands emitting synchronized photons.

# When the conduction and valence bands overlap, the atom is a '''conductor''' and allows for the free movement of electrons. Conductors are metals and can be thought of as a bunch of atomic nuclei surrounded by a churning &quot;sea of electrons&quot;.
# When there is a large energy level gap between the conduction and valence bands, the atom is an '''insulator'''; it traps electrons. Many insulators are non-metals and are good at blocking the flow of electrons.
# When there is a small energy level gap between the conduction and valence bands, the atom is a '''semiconductor'''. Semiconductors behave like conductors and insulators, and work using the conduction and valence bands. The electrons in the outer valence band are known as '''holes'''. They behave like positive charges because of how they flow. In semiconductors electrons collide with the material and their progress is halted. This makes the electrons have an '''effective mass''' that is less than their normal mass. In some semiconductors holes have a larger effective mass than the conduction electrons.

Electronic devices are based on the idea of exploiting the differences between conductors, insulators, and semiconductors but also exploit known physical phenomena such as electromagnetism and phosphorescence.

==Conductors==

In a metal the electrons of an object are free to move from atom to atom. Due to their mutual repulsion (calculable via [[Electrodynamics/Coulombs Law|Coulomb's Law ]]),  the valence electrons are forced from the centre of the object and spread out evenly across its surface in order to be as far apart as possible. This '''cavity''' of empty space is known as a '''Faraday Cage''' and stops '''electromagnetic radiation''', such as charge, radio waves, and [[Electronics/Signal Propagation|'''EMP''']]s (Electro-Magnetic Pulses) from entering and leaving the object. If there are holes in the Faraday Cage then radiation can pass.

One of the interesting things to do with conductors is demonstrate the transfer of charge between metal spheres. Start by taking two identical and uncharged metal spheres which are each suspended by insulators (such as a pieces of string). The first step involves putting sphere 1 next to but not touching sphere 2. This causes all the electrons in sphere 2 to travel away from sphere 1 to the far end of sphere 2. So sphere 2 now has a negative end filled with electrons and a positive end lacking electrons. Next sphere 2 is '''grounded''' by contact with a conductor connected with the earth and the earth takes its electrons leaving sphere 2 with a positive charge. The positive charge (absence of electrons) spreads evenly across the surface due to its lack of electrons.  If suspended by strings, the relatively negatively charged sphere 1 will attract the relatively positively charged sphere 2.

==Insulators==

In an insulator the charges of a material are stuck and cannot flow. This allows an imbalance of charge to build up on the surface of the object by way of the triboelectric effect. The '''triboelectric effect''' (rubbing electricity effect) involves the exchange of electrons when two different insulators such as glass, hard rubber, amber, or even the seat of one's trousers, come into contact. The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the material composition and its surface smoothness. For example, glass rubbed with silk will build up a charge, as will hard rubber rubbed with fur. The effect is greatly enhanced by rubbing materials together. 

* '''Van de Graaff Generator:''' A '''charge pump''' (pump for electrons) that generates static electricity. In a Van de Graaff generator, a conveyor belt uses  rubbing to pick up electrons, which are then deposited on metal brushes. The end result is a charge difference.

Because the material being rubbed is now charged, contact with an uncharged object or an object with the opposite charge may cause a discharge of the built-up '''static electricity''' by way of a spark. A person simply walking across a carpet may build up enough charge to cause a spark to travel over a centimetre. The spark is powerful enough to attract dust particles to cloth, destroy electrical equipment, ignite gas fumes, and create lightning. In extreme cases the spark can destroy factories that deal with gunpowder and explosives. The best way to remove static electricity is by discharging it through grounding. Humid air will also slowly discharge static electricity. This is one reason [[Electronics/Cells|cells]] and [[Electronics/Capacitors|capacitors]] lose charge over time. 

Note: The concept of an insulator changes depending on the applied voltage.  Air looks like an insulator when a low voltage is applied.  But it breaks down as an insulator, becomes ionised, at about ten kilovolts per centimetre.  A person could put their shoe across the terminals of a car battery and it would look like an insulator.  But putting a shoe across a ten kilovolt powerline will cause a short. [[File:Multiple Lightning Strikes.jpg|center]]

==Quantity of Charge==

Protons and electrons have opposite but equal charge.  Because in almost all cases, the charge on protons or electrons is the smallest amount of charge commonly discussed, the quantity of charge of one proton is considered one positive '''elementary charge''' and the charge of one electron is one negative '''elementary charge'''.  Because atoms and such particles are so small, and charge in amounts of multi-trillions of elementary charges are usually discussed, a much larger unit of charge is typically used.  The '''coulomb''' is a unit of charge, which can be expressed as a positive or negative number, which is equal to approximately 6.2415×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; elementary charges.  Accordingly, an elementary charge is equal to approximately 1.602×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs.  The commonly used abbreviation for the coulomb is a capital '''C'''.  The [[w:SI|SI]] definition of a coulomb is the quantity of charge which passes a point over a period of 
1 second ( s ) when a current of 1 [[Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power|ampere]] (A) flows past that point, i.e., C = A&amp;middot;s  or  A = C/s.  You may find it helpful during later lessons to retain this picture in your mind (even though you may not recall the exact number). An [[Wikipedia:ampere|ampere]] is one of the fundamental units in physics from which various other units are defined, such as the coulomb.

==Force between Charges: Coulomb's Law==

The repulsive or attractive '''electrostatic force''' between charges decreases as the charges are located further from each other by the square of the distance between them.  An equation called '''Coulomb's law''' determines the electrostatic force between two charged objects.  The following picture shows a charge ''q'' at a certain point with another charge ''Q'' at a distance of ''r'' away from it.  The presence of ''Q'' causes an electrostatic force to be exerted on ''q''.  

[[image:Coulomb's_Law_between_2_Charges.PNG]]&lt;br&gt;

The magnitude of the electrostatic force ''F'', on a charge ''q'', due to another charge ''Q'', equals '''Coulomb's constant''' multiplied by the product of the two charges (in coulombs) divided by the square of the distance ''r'', between the charges ''q'' and ''Q''.  Here a capital ''Q'' and small ''q'' are [[scalar]] quantities used for symbolizing the two charges, but other symbols such as ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been used in other sources.  These symbols for charge were used for consistency with the [[Wikipedia:Electric field|electric field]] article in Wikipedia and are consistent with the Reference below.  


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F = \frac {k q Q}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


''F'' = magnitude of electrostatic force on charge ''q''  due to another charge ''Q'' &lt;br&gt;
''r'' = distance (magnitude quantity in above equation) between ''q'' and ''Q'' &lt;br&gt;
''k'' = Coulomb's constant = 8.9875&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;   N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in free space


The value of Coulomb's constant given here is such that the preceding Coulomb's Law equation will work if both ''q'' and ''Q'' are given in units of coulombs, ''r'' in metres, and ''F'' in newtons and there is no dielectric material between the charges.  A '''dielectric material''' is one that reduces the electrostatic force when placed between charges.  Furthermore, Coulomb's constant can be given by:  

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = \frac {1}{4 \pi  \epsilon }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \,&lt;/math&gt; = '''permittivity'''.   When there is no dielectric material between the charges (for example, in free space or a vacuum),

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon _0\,&lt;/math&gt; = 8.85419 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;   C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/center&gt;

Air is only very weakly dielectric and the value above for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon _0\,&lt;/math&gt; will work well enough with air between the charges.  If a dielectric material is present, then

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\epsilon  = \kappa \epsilon _0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; is the '''dielectric constant''' which depends on the dielectric material.  In a vacuum (free space), &lt;math&gt;\kappa = 1&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;\epsilon  = \epsilon _0&lt;/math&gt;.  For air, &lt;math&gt;\kappa = 1.0006&lt;/math&gt;.  Typically, solid insulating materials have values of &lt;math&gt;\kappa &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and will reduce electric force between charges.  The dielectric constant can also be called '''relative permittivity''', symbolized as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; in [[Wikipedia:Dielectric|Wikipedia]].  


Highly charged particles close to each other exert heavy forces on each other; if the charges are less or they are farther apart, the force is less.  As the charges move far enough apart, their effect on each other becomes negligible.  


Any force on an object is a [[vector]] quantity.  Vector quantities such as forces are characterized by a numerical magnitude (i. e. basically the size of the force) and a direction.  A vector is often pictured by an arrow pointing in the direction.  In a force vector, the direction is the one in which the force pulls the object.  The symbol &lt;math&gt;\vec {F}&lt;/math&gt; is used here for the electric force vector.  If charges ''q'' and ''Q'' are either both positive or both negative, then they will repel each other.  This means the direction of the electric force &lt;math&gt;\vec {F}&lt;/math&gt; on ''q'' due to ''Q'' is away from ''Q'' in exactly the opposite direction, as shown by the red arrow in the preceding diagram.  If one of the charges is positive and the other negative, then they will attract each other.   This means that the direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec {F}&lt;/math&gt; on ''q'' due to ''Q'' is exactly in the direction towards ''Q'', as shown by the blue arrow in the preceding diagram.  The Coulomb's equation shown above will give a magnitude for a repulsive force away from the ''Q'' charge.  A property of a vector is that if its magnitude is negative, the vector will be equal to a vector with an equivalent but positive magnitude and exactly the opposite direction.  So, if the magnitude given by the above equation is negative due to opposite charges, the direction of the resulting force will be directly opposite of away from ''Q'', meaning the force will be towards ''Q'', an attractive force.  In other sources, different variations of Coulombs' Law are given, including vector formulas in some cases (see Wikipedia link and reference(s) below).


In many situations, there may be many charges, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, through ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', on the charge ''q'' in question.  Each of the ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' charges will exert an electric force on ''q''.  The direction of the force depends on the location of the surrounding charges.  A Coulomb's Law calculation between ''q'' and a corresponding ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; charge would give the magnitude of the electric force exerted by each of the ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; charges for ''i'' = 1 through ''n'', '''but''' the direction of each of the component forces must also be used to determine the individual force vectors, &lt;math&gt;\vec {F_1}, \vec {F_2}, \vec {F_3}, ...., \vec {F_n}&lt;/math&gt;.  To determine the total electric force on ''q'', the electric force contributions from each of these charges add up as '''vector''' quantities, not just like ordinary (or scalar) numbers.   

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec {F_e} = \vec {F_1} + \vec {F_2} + \vec {F_3} + ..... + \vec {F_n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The total electric force on ''q'' is additive to any other forces affecting it, but all of the forces are to be added together as '''vectors''' to obtain the total force on the charged object ''q''.  In many cases, there are billions of electrons or other charges present, so that geometrical distributions of charges are used with equations stemming from Coulomb's Law.  Practically speaking, such calculations are usually of more interest to a physicist than an electrician, electrical engineer, or electronics hobbyist, so they will not be discussed much more in this book, except in the section on capacitors.

In addition to the electrostatic forces described here, electromagnetic forces are created when the charges are moving.  These will be described later.

== Should we put Electric Field in here? ==

I'm just about done with this module for now.  As a low priority, I may someday put in a picture of forces on q due to multiple point charges.  There are a couple things that the Electronics regular authors may want to consider now.  

* This module isn't too long.  In the next module [[Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power]] (most of which I wrote), there is a section called &quot;Electric Field.&quot;  That module seems longer and a little more material may be added to it under Voltage and Current and more under Circuit.  Should we move the &quot;Electric Field&quot; section into this module or should we keep it where it is?  Eventually, I plan to move it to the &quot;Charge and Coulomb's Law&quot; module and rename the module &quot;Electronics:Charge, Coulomb's Law, and Electric Field.&quot;  But if I'm told the consensus is that it should stay where it is, then we won't move it and I'll keep the [[Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power]] name unchanged, because it's a rather small, less important part of a bigger module covering numerous other topics.  

* A number of books don't go into the dielectric correction when first presenting Coulomb's Law.  As an afterthought, I added equations on it separately, because I think it's important to mention it.  For simplicity or brevity, if any of the Electronics authors care to undertake the task of combining all the permittivity equations with Coulomb's Law into one equation but keeping the same information, I would have no objection.  

* Under &quot;Balance of Charge&quot; section, there seems to be &quot;loose&quot; bullet statement about laser.  If anybody wants to do something about that, go ahead.  

On a low priority basis, I might someday copy some of the information in this module over to the first module of Electromagnetism in the &quot;Modern Physics&quot; book.

== Electronics? ==

Should this be Electronics:Charge and Coulomb's Law, or is it being used by other books, etc.  I don't want to put a TOC in if it is shared.

== Name of this module ==

Before I learned about '''moving''' modules, I copied and pasted [[Electronics/Charge]] into this module and then added the section on Coulomb's Law.  A better thing to have done would have been to '''move''' [[Electronics/Charge]] to this module when it was new, essentially renaming it.  This way the history of [[Electronics/Charge]] would have been preserved, giving [[User:Wanderer]] credit for writing the first part on charge (up to but not including Quantity of Charge, which I wrote).  This [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]] module is being used only by the Electronics book.  Wanderer has copied the [[Electronics/Charge]] information into [[Physics in English:Charge]] for his &quot;Physics in English&quot; book (Coulomb's Law section is not included).  I also copied practically all of the Coulomb's Law section from this [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]] module and the Electric Field section in the next module into a new module called [[Modern Physics:Coulomb's Law and the Electric Field]] for the Modern Physics book.  I plan to leave things the way they are in this [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]] module for a little while to get a feel for whether the Electronics regulars want to include the Electric Field section in here or not.  When this issue is decided, &lt;br&gt;I plan to '''move''' [[Electronics/Charge]] to new module, insert Electric Field from the next module if so decided, and call the new module either [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]] or [[Electronics/Charge, Coulomb's Law, and Electric Field]].  After that the [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]] module can then be deleted by administrators.

== when did everything get bolded? ==

i '''mean''' do we '''really''' need to bold every '''other''' word? - Omegatron

== overcomplicated ==
this isn'y really usable to teach people about electronics as most teachers would teach ohms law first and resistor color band codes, then (after introducing a lot of components and circuits) introduce all of the theories on this page when it gets to the point that could be applied to their work, you're not going to remember it if you never use it. also there's no hands on experience in this entire book. Someone please organize this into a usable textbook form.

: Another user has started a more hands-on text called [[LearnElectronics]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:46, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

== Is this correct? ==

In the second paragraph of the first section it says &quot;Atoms only gain and lose protons and electrons through fusion, fission, and radioactive decay.&quot;  I don't want to change it myself, because I don't really know much about physics (that is why I am reading this), but I think it should say &quot;Atoms only gain and lose protons and ''neutrons'' through fusion, fission, and radioactive decay.&quot;  Earlier in that same paragraph it had said that atoms can lose electrons, which causes them to become ions.

:You are correct. You could also change &quot;radioactive decay&quot; to &quot;radioactive alpha-decay&quot;. Beta and gamma radiation do not affect the nucleus. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:00, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

== A Better use of your time...  ==

would be to disregard this wikibook and check out http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/electricCircuits/ 
I believe this book is far more accurate. But then again, who among you reading this discussion can remember where the local LIBRARY is, to go check out a few books (Understanding Physics vol. i, ii, iii by Isaac Asimov).

:Of course, you can get the one I have; same text, but combined into one volume.  But the publishers were only interested in pushing up Asimov's book count and making money without doing any work--so they just used the same plates, with the page numbers in volumes 2 and 3 renumbered.  But they had so little concern for the reader that they didn't update the zillions of internal links to those pages so that they told you where to go.  The books also have as many annoying little errors as the poorer books on Wikibooks.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 11:31, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

== probably incorrect ==

in the section on conductors it says: &quot;This causes all the electrons in sphere 2 to travel away from sphere 1 to the far end of sphere 2.&quot; That can't be right.

I'm sure all are &quot;pushed&quot;, but they can't all go to the other side. That would create an insanely strong electromagnetic force.

Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me can fix this.

Also I noticed towards the second half of the page the term &quot;electric force&quot; is used without much explanation. I wonder if some more specific term should be used (such as perhaps &quot;electrostatic force&quot;) or if this is the correct term and it should be defined/explained.

Thank you. Best regards -- Jason Woofenden

== Focus ==

This chapter is called Charge and Coulombs Law.  So where is Q=It is there is the SI defininition.  That is the most important point of the chapter. I have a cell/battery with 3600 Coulombs of charge or 1 Ampere hours so I can draw a current of 1 Ampere from it for an hour or a current of 0.1 A for 10 hours.--[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 18:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

== +ve and -ve ==
The &quot;(+) and (-) Ions&quot; section suddenly starts talking about +ve and -ve, what are these supposed to mean? [[User:Jeffrey.Rodriguez|Jeffrey.Rodriguez]] ([[User talk:Jeffrey.Rodriguez|talk]]) 18:29, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

:I believe it means positive and negative, but I find it (and the rest of that paragraph) very confusing. Perhaps relying less on text and a bit more on a diagram of some kind could clear that paragraph up.

== Photoelectric effect incorrect ==
I believe the explanation about photoelectric effect to be incorrect. What the text claims to be the photoelectric effect (absorbing an electron and emitting a photon) is the exact opposite of what the photoelectric effect is (absorbing photons and emitting electrons). The process of emitting a photon when an excited electron falls back is called fluorescence. See the wikipedia articles on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence fluorescence] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect the photoelectric effect]. -- [[Special:Contributions/213.119.143.106|213.119.143.106]] ([[User talk:213.119.143.106|discuss]]) 17:11, 15 July 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== KVL analogies ==

From the article:

:Kirchoff's laws can be described with a sentence as &quot;What comes in, must go out&quot;. It's that simple.

Not really.  KCL works for &quot;what goes in comes out&quot;, but KVL is more like &quot;what goes up comes down&quot;, but not really. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

:''Yes'' really: Voltage is exactly analagous to height in a gravitational situation.

::Yeah, but it's not an exact analogy to KVL, is it?  KVL is more like &quot;if you go up 5 stairs and go down some stairs and are on the ground, you must have gone down 5 stairs.&quot;

::Here is a better description of it:

:::&quot;Applying KVL is analogous to taking a walk while paying attention to increases and decreases in altitude.  If you walk in a loop (ie. you end your walk where you started) the net change in altitude is zero.  This is true for any path that you take for your walk. &quot; - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:28, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I agree, but maybe we could make it even simpler:
:''Kirchoff's laws can be described in 2 sentences: &quot;What comes in, must go out&quot;. &quot;What goes up, must come down&quot;. It's that simple.''

I like the way those sentences hint that the KVL is not *always* true. (because we know &quot;what goes up, must come down&quot; is also not *always* true).

In a very few situations, I need the full equation:

sum( forces on a block of wood ) = mass * change in velocity / time

sum( voltages around a loop ) = area of loop * change in magnetic field / time

In most circuits the magnetic field does not change significantly.
In most buildings, bridges, dams, etc., the velocity does not change significantly.

For practical circuit design, I generally assume that

sum( voltages around a loop ) = 0 (not exactly true, but close enough for circuit design)

in the same way that when I design a truss, I generally assume that

sum( forces on a block of wood ) = 0 (not exactly true, but close enough for bridge design).

== Removed from article ==
In parallel voltage...

:''you can't have ideal voltage sources in parallel, if this is what is meant by this statement.  it is equivalent to saying 3=5.  With source impedances, like real cells, they can be in parallel, but that would be silly...''

The flow a circuit is that of a potential drop.  

:''what??''


== de-emphasize current divider? ==

Voltage dividers are important to know.
The idea of a voltage divider equation is used in many different circuits --
bandpass filters, power loss in power lines, etc.
Is the current divider really that important?
What is it used for?
If it's not that important,
perhaps we could de-emphasize it.
Make it a &quot;study problem&quot;
to practice Ohm's law?
(or perhaps Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuits)?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 04:09, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that voltage dividers are more often used.  But this does not mean that current dividers are unimportant in electronic circuit analysis involving current sources it is easier to use current divider than voltage divider.  Currently I would say that voltage dividers are already more emphasised than current dividers.  I am not aware of any practical use of it.  The only use I can think of is if you wanted to have two different currents flowing in two different branches of the circuit.  But it is a useful in circuit analysis especially when there are current sources instead of voltage sources. --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 18:46, 28 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am new to Wikipedia so bear with me , can we mention specific brand names to illustrate a mechanical point , this is essential when discussing the design of guitars and due to common knowledge one wouldn't need to copy or plagiarise any work on the subject .
If this is allowed , would a simple credit to the manufacturer suffice ?

I can't say for sure, but I think that a simple mention of manufacturers and company trademarks, when needed, would suffice.

Whoever designed the picture did a great job but in Britain the pick guard is more commonly known as the scratchplate. Could the designer change it?

== My Interactive Guitar Guide ==

The - I-IV-V Know Your Guitar Guide - built to combine my love (music) with my work (web programming)...

[http://fullymyspace.com/I_IV_V_KnowYourGuitarGuide/]

Includes: Play Along Chord Chart, Guitar Anatomy, I-IV-V Song Builder, Metronome, One-way tuner, I-IV-V Song Samples, and instructional videos. All instructional text kept to a minimum (for minimal reading).

== Some ideas on this section ==

I think this part of the book is actually very good but the way it is laid out and the vast amount of information may be not suitable for the beginning of this book. As the 2nd section of this book it actually is too lengthy - you want people to play the guitar not spend all their time reading about different woods. You will not find any book on playing the guitar that makes the reader wade through 5 or 6 chapters of extensive text before they come to actual exercises.

I'm going to thin out any duplicate material from this section and maybe try to improve the formatting. 

After scanning through this section I must say that whoever wrote the &quot;woods&quot; part did an excellent job with no duplication. So I'm going to concentrate on formatting and maybe as a 2nd section it is ok in its length and my initial belief that its length would deter readers may be wrong. I am a guitarist who insists on &quot;playing&quot; rather than &quot;supreme knowledge&quot; - nothing worse than jamming with a jazz guitarist whose learnt all the chords and their usage but never followed Segovia's advice of two hours of technical exercises followed by two hours of scales (I would do an hour) to a metronome - basically I followed that advice and the first three hours of any study practice for me would be technical exercises to a metronome and then scales. I've got nothing against &quot;string buzzers&quot; but its not for me. 

Offcourse the most important thing for any guitarist is to do what makes you happy but please don't expect congratulations for that out-of-time and string buzzing version of &quot;Yesterday&quot; by The Beatles that you just played. False praise is just that, &quot;false&quot;, and is usually given by audiences to performers as a tonic for the ego that didn't care about them.

== Removed a block of text dealing with Amps  ==

I removed the text on Amps. This section is about the &quot;Anatomy of a Guitar&quot; and amps and effects should go in their appropiate section. Because the part I removed is relevant to this book I've pasted it here - I'll add it to the correct section at a later date. Feel free to reverse my edit or add the section to where it belongs.

Amplifier and effects

The amplifier is absolutely necessary when playing the electric guitar. Acoustic guitars with no internal pickup may be amplified with a microphone and a specifically built acoustic amp or PA. Different amplifiers will give the same guitar a different sound and some amps are more appropriate for certain genres of music. Many amplifiers have effects built in. The most common being distortion; often called overdrive. If the amplifier has a &quot;lead&quot; channel then this can be turned up to produce distortion. This is possible because the pre-amplifier (pre-amp) will overdrive the amplifier's tubes or transistors therefore causing the amplification not to be linear. The more the tubes and transistors are driven, the greater the distortion.

Turning up the pre-amplifier will increase the volume. To compensate amps also have a &quot;gain&quot; knob which can be turned down to reduce the volume after overdrive. Overdriving an amp can result in sounds loud enough to cause damage especially blown speakers. This can happen to small 25w amps as well as large rigs. If you have just bought an amp or have use of unfamiliar equipment then always turn down the gain when plugging in and slowly and carefully adjust to the appropriate level. Distortion can also be provided by effects pedals. Other on-board effects you may find on an amp are chorus, reverb, wah-wah, compression and delay.

== String length and the octave in the Fretboard section ==

I've added a bit about frequency. Though I've described the action of producing the octave as &quot;halving&quot; the string; in reality its a doubling of the frequency of vibrations. 

I'm not too sure if its useful to the paragraph but I'll leave as is. If for any reason you think that it shouldn't be included (esp. since it is a &quot;side note&quot;) or that it can be explained better or placed elsewhere; then go ahead and edit the paragraph as you see fit.

== Material removed from Tremolo section to be placed in a new section at a later date. ==

This is the material I removed. I felt as though it was quite advanced in some descriptions. I've placed it here for later integration into the book. Feel free to revert my edits or to paste this material into a new chapter.

'''Removed'''

The only way to rarely go out of tune is to either use the Floyd Rose tremolo or a hardtail (no tremolo). If you prefer to ease of setup while staying in tune with a tremolo, you can also try Yamaha's &quot;finger clamp&quot; locking tremolo, which requires no tools when setting up, or use locking tuners and roller nuts, as in Fender's locking tremolo.

A '''hardtail''' (no tremolo) bridge is great at staying in tune. However, it also has additional benefits, in that it also improved sound and sustain. The fixed bridge also makes it easier to perform string bends, and gives an altogether warmer and rounder sound than one with tremolo. 

Despite such simple concept, there are at least three versions of ending the string: 
#The first kind is the stop bar method, used from cheap budget types to expensive archtop and PRS guitars, where a stop bar that's mounted on top of the body holds the string's end. Sometimes it is also integrated to the bridge.
#The second kind is known as thru-body, where the string goes into the body; this enhanced sustain, but typically more expensive. the bridge, however, is a separate piece of hardware. Example would be Gibson's tune-o-matic. Despite this, strings still slide over the nut and saddles when playing/bending strings, just not as much as they do on a normal synchronized tremolo.
#The third kind of tail bridge is the fixed locking bridge, based upon the Floyd Rose tremolo except it is fixed; in this configuration, the string is clamped down, which ensure the string is stay in tune. Due to the fact that it's a fixed bridge, there are no spring cavity in the back; instead, the bridge is more or less mounted directly above the tail piece, which is usually thru-body. This is the best method to stay in tune. Currently, only Ibanez makes fixed locking bridge.

== Set thru neck material removed - to be placed in different section ==

I've removed this material. It is relevant but I thought it didn't allow the article to end smoothly - it read like a &quot;variation&quot; (which it is) on the other main ways of attaching a neck. Will add it to a newly created section maybe &quot;Advanced Topics&quot; or &quot;Advanced Variations, Customizing and Features&quot;.

&lt;u&gt;Removed text&lt;/u&gt;

'''Set through''' can be seen as a modification of a thru-body neck, which is done by the following
* A pocket in the instrument's body for insertion of neck, as in bolt-on method. However, the pocket is much deeper than usual one.
* Long neck plank, comparable to the scale length, as in the neck-through method.
* Glueing (setting) the long neck inside the deep pocket, as in the set-in method.
The result is usually told to have combined advantages of all these methods, mostly eliminating their disadvantages. Luthiers frequently cite:
*improved tone and sustain (due to deep insertion and body made of single piece of wood, not laminated as in neck-through),
* &quot;warmer&quot; tone (due to set joint)
* comfortable access to top frets (due to lack of hard heel and bolt plate),
* better wood stability.
The main disadvantage is a relatively complex construction method that leads to higher manufacturing and servicing costs. Another cited disadvantage is the inability or difficulty of adding a double-locking tremolo to the guitar, as the routing for cavities would interfere with deeply set neck.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programming ==
Programming is the way you put your concept in practice, how you build your game. There are a wide variety of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language programming languages]. These languages will be covered in more detail later on.

Game programmer or game developers, take the implement the game design, most parts of a video game programming are boring and non-creative unless the game design requires some innovation or updates. But take care the worst situation for any developer especially one implementing a video game is in having a poor video game design to start with, the inability to make decisions or be non committal to choices will result in the developers having to implement bad concepts until the game designer accepts the results (or is forced to give the go ahead because of time/costs constrains), resulting in a substandard product.

Not all developing is attractive and in games most of it is not, for instance the front of a game is mostly common amongst most games designs doing one more is just going through hops. Now let's take for example the task of supporting hardware changes in video cards or even the low level optimization tasks, that would be the top of the cream for a creative programmer.

{{NOTE|This notions can also serve to establish a good game developing team, not all jobs are the same or even as complex and depending on how down to basics you wish to go on developing your idea, you may need very few expert programmers.}}

=== Learning to Program === 
Because it is arguably the most difficult part of game design, we are going to spend a fair bit of time on it. If you have some idea of what language you want to learn and have read up on the various languages, you should actually start learning. If you can take classes that is great, if not there are many alternatives. Buy some programming books, look up some tutorials on the Internet or on Wikibooks and look through the source code of Open Source programs. Don't think it will be easy, it is not; but try and have fun with it. If you do not have fun that sort of defeats the whole purpose does it not? 

Some Resources: 
[http://code.google.com/ Google Code], 
[http://sourceforge.net/ Sourceforge]

=== Choosing a Programming Language === 
Before you start programming, it is important to choose a programming language that suits your needs. 
Remember that no language is perfect for everyone or every situation. There is such an incredible selection of languages that it can be nearly impossible to choose one. Before you make up your mind to learn Java or Assembly, make sure you know what you are planning to make. How complex is the game? 
Certainly it would be counter-productive to spend a lot of time and energy learning a language that does not have the power to make what you are planning, just as it would be counter-productive to learn a language that is overly complex for your needs. 
When you start reading about the various languages, you will inevitably read about &quot;low-level&quot; and &quot;high-level&quot; languages. At this stage this does not concern you so much, but later on it will be very important. Essentially, low level languages (ex: C++, C, Asm) are more powerful and faster allowing you to control the inner workings of the computer. However, they are generally harder to learn. Higher level languages (ex: BASIC) are easier to learn and use, but lack the power and flexibility that lower level languages have.



=== Sound ===
Sound plays an integral part in any game as it affects the mood of the player at a conscious and subconscious level! Could you imagine playing UT or Quake without sound? It would be unbearable! Sound in games ( depending on the game of course ) generally consists of background music, event sound effects ( honking a car horn, gunfire etc ) and environmental sound effects (footsteps, wind blowing, birds, beach waves, bugs, echoes etc). 

Background music depending on the game can play all the time, but also like in film stop completely and change to fit certain moods, such as if you enter a battle the music might change to a track with a faster beat or become more erratic.

Sound effects on the other hand, play when they are triggered by some event. If a player were to open a door, there could be creaking noise coming from the door. Sound effects can add a lot of realism to a game and choosing the right sounds can really make a game come alive. Please note however, too many of them, or ones that have unrealistic properties, can hurt the game experience, or annoy the player. For example there is a game with a jetpack in it. This jetpack has unlimited fuel, so players can float in the air for an indefinite amount of time. While the jetpack is running, it makes a noise like rushing air. This noise becomes very annoying over time, because it is heard a lot during the game. Also, if a sound has strange properties, it can detract from realism. Eg, a machine gun that goes quack, or a machine gun that has sound faster than its actual firing rate.

Environmental sound effects are triggered simply when the player enters the environment and play in a loop until the player leaves. Please note that these sound files are most numerous and multiple sounds are sometimes looped in a random order to create a sense of variety in a environment (i.e. two birds singing that sound completely different or two characters walking and the shoes clucking sounds different for each character).

=== Input ===
Games usually give many options to players regarding input. Common means of input include the mouse, keyboard, joysticks, and gamepads. Ideally, a game engine should abstract the input so that the user can select from any of the above. Furthermore, one important thing to remember is that all gamers have different preferences in regards to key or button placement, and often want a certain specific configuration. This means the input should also be abstracted to allow buttons or keys to perform different actions in the game.

==== Keyboard ====
It's important to first understand the different ways keyboard events can be interpreted by the program. The most common ways to receive keyboard events are through ''callbacks'' and ''polling''.
* '''Callbacks''' - Often used by games that utilize the GLUT library, function pointers are passed to GLUT which &quot;register&quot; that function as the keyboard event callback. This means, any time a key is pressed or released, GLUT calls the respective function, passing the key data and allowing the program to respond accordingly.
* '''Polling''' - Used more often by games using SDL, polling is helpful if callback functions break abstraction in an engine. Polling is a process by which the game checks a collection of keyboard events in its spare time. So, for each pass through the game loop, your game can poll the collection, resulting in quick response to key events, and no loss of data.

=== Networking ===
Every operating system has its own TCP/IP API, so if you are planning on developing for a specific platform, then you must look into that OS's SDK (such as WinSock for the Windows API). If you are writing games for portability across multiple platforms, one good possibility is [http://jcatki.no-ip.org:8080/SDL_net/ SDL_net].

After choosing the networking API, classes should be constructed for a game engine that encapsulate sockets. One must also make the decision between networking protocols, TCP and UDP (although through abstraction, either could be used).

* '''TCP''' - This protocol sets up a connection between two computers. Data sent between computers is resent if any errors are present. The disadvantage to this protocol is that it is not as fast overall as UDP.
* '''UDP''' - This protocol does not set up a connection. Data packets are sent to an address, and the sender does not know if it arrived properly and error free. A protocol could be written using UDP to provide error checking and resending.

The decision is up to the programmer, and what is best for the game. If the subject is an online game of chess, where speed is not a major concern, TCP could be used to avoid some headaches. But, for a large team of people in a FPS, UDP would be a better choice, due to speed.

=== Scripting ===
Here's a list of free scripting engines used in games development:
* [http://www.konsolscript.org KonsolScript] - A free software game scripting language
* [http://www.lua.org Lua] - The Lua scripting language

=== Game Tools ===
Here is a list of free software tools for use in game development.
* [http://www.blender.org Blender3D] - A free and very advanced modeling program, a bit tricky to get used to but just as capable as any other commercial modeling program.
* [http://www.ogre3d.org OGRE] - A free software graphics engine. Top notch.
* [http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/ Terragen] - A free for non-commercial use terrain generator
* [http://www.caligari.com/ TrueSpace] - Professional grade 3D modeling, animation and rendering package, previously costing up to $700 (USD), now available as a free download after a buy-out of Caligari by Microsoft.

#Scale an anchovy, pound it, and fry it in butter together with a small onion cut across, and four ounces of boiled rice. 
#Add a little salt, and when the rice is a golden brown, take out the onion and gradually add some good stock until the dish is of the consistency of rice pudding.

A list in Python is an ordered group of items (or ''elements''). It is a very general structure, and list elements don't have to be of the same type: you can put numbers, letters, strings and nested lists all on the same list.

==Overview==
Lists in Python at a glance:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = []                      # A new empty list
list2 = [1, 2, 3, &quot;cat&quot;]        # A new non-empty list with mixed item types
list1.append(&quot;cat&quot;)             # Add a single member, at the end of the list
list1.extend([&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;mouse&quot;])  # Add several members
if &quot;cat&quot; in list1:              # Membership test
  list1.remove(&quot;cat&quot;)           # Remove AKA delete
#list1.remove(&quot;elephant&quot;) - throws an error
for item in list1:              # Iteration AKA for each item
  print item
print &quot;Item count:&quot;, len(list1) # Length AKA size AKA item count
list3 = [6, 7, 8, 9]
for i in range(0, len(list3)):  # Read-write iteration AKA for each item
  list3[i] += 1                 # Item access AKA element access by index
isempty = len(list3) == 0       # Test for emptiness
set1 = set([&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;])      # Initialize set from a list
list4 = list(set1)              # Get a list from a set
list5 = list4[:]                # A shallow list copy
list4equal5 = list4==list5      # True: same by value
list4refEqual5 = list4 is list5 # False: not same by reference
list6 = list4[:]
del list6[:]                    # Clear AKA empty AKA erase
list7 = [1, 2] + [2, 3, 4]      # Concatenation
print list1, list2, list3, list4, list5, list6, list7
print list4equal5, list4refEqual5
print list3[1:3], list3[1:], list3[:2] # Slices
print max(list3 ), min(list3 ), sum(list3) # Aggregates
&lt;/source&gt;

== List creation ==
There are two different ways to make a list in Python. The first is through assignment (&quot;statically&quot;), the second is using list comprehensions (&quot;actively&quot;).

=== Plain creation===

To make a static list of items, write them between square brackets. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
[ 1,2,3,&quot;This is a list&quot;,'c',Donkey(&quot;kong&quot;) ]
&lt;/source&gt;

Observations:

# The list contains items of different data types: integer, string, and Donkey class.
# Objects can be created 'on the fly' and added to lists. The last item is a new instance of Donkey class.

Creation of a new list whose members are constructed from non-literal expressions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 2
b = 3
myList = [a+b, b+a, len([&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;])]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== List comprehensions ===
''See also [[Python Programming/Tips_and_Tricks#List_comprehension_and_generators|Tips and Tricks]]''

Using list comprehension, you describe the process using which the list should be created. To do that, the list is broken into two pieces. The first is a picture of what each element will look like, and the second is what you do to get it.

For instance, let's say we have a list of words:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
listOfWords = [&quot;this&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;list&quot;,&quot;of&quot;,&quot;words&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;

To take the first letter of each word and make a list out 
of it using list comprehension, we can do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; listOfWords = [&quot;this&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;list&quot;,&quot;of&quot;,&quot;words&quot;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print items
['t', 'i', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'w']
&lt;/source&gt;

List comprehension supports more than one for statement.
It will evaluate the items in all of the objects sequentially and will
loop over the shorter objects if one object is longer than the rest.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; item = [x+y for x in 'cat' for y in 'pot']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print item
['cp', 'co', 'ct', 'ap', 'ao', 'at', 'tp', 'to', 'tt']
&lt;/source&gt;

List comprehension supports an if statement, to only include members into the list that fulfill a certain condition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [x+y for x in 'cat' for y in 'pot']
['cp', 'co', 'ct', 'ap', 'ao', 'at', 'tp', 'to', 'tt']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [x+y for x in 'cat' for y in 'pot' if x != 't' and y != 'o' ]
['cp', 'ct', 'ap', 'at']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [x+y for x in 'cat' for y in 'pot' if x != 't' or y != 'o' ]
['cp', 'co', 'ct', 'ap', 'ao', 'at', 'tp', 'tt']
&lt;/source&gt;

In version 2.x, Python's list comprehension does not define a scope. Any variables that are bound in an evaluation remain bound to whatever they were last bound to when the evaluation was completed. In version 3.x Python's list comprehension uses local variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x, y                         #Input to python version 2
r t                                    #Output using python 2

&gt;&gt;&gt; print x, y                         #Input to python version 3
NameError: name 'x' is not defined     #Python 3 returns an error because x and y were not leaked
&lt;/source&gt;

This is exactly the same as if the comprehension
had been expanded into an explicitly-nested group of one
or more 'for' statements and 0 or more 'if' statements.

=== List creation shortcuts ===

You can initialize a list to a size, with an initial value for each element:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; zeros=[0]*5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print zeros
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
&lt;/source&gt;

This works for any data type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foos=['foo']*3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print foos
['foo', 'foo', 'foo']
&lt;/source&gt;

But there is a caveat. When building a new list by multiplying, Python copies each item by reference. This poses a problem for mutable items, for instance in a multidimensional array where each element is itself a list. You'd guess that the easy way to generate a two dimensional array would be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
listoflists=[ [0]*4 ] *5
&lt;/source&gt;

and this works, but probably doesn't do what you expect:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; listoflists=[ [0]*4 ] *5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print listoflists
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; listoflists[0][2]=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print listoflists
[[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
&lt;/source&gt;

What's happening here is that Python is using the same reference to the inner list as the elements of the outer list.  Another way of looking at this issue is to examine how Python sees the above definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; innerlist=[0]*4
&gt;&gt;&gt; listoflists=[innerlist]*5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print listoflists
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; innerlist[2]=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print listoflists
[[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
&lt;/source&gt;

Assuming the above effect is not what you intend, one way around this issue is to use list comprehensions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; listoflists=[[0]*4 for i in range(5)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print listoflists
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; listoflists[0][2]=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print listoflists
[[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
&lt;/source&gt;

== List Attributes ==

To find the length of a list use the built in len() method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; len([1,2,3])
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; len( a )
4
&lt;/source&gt;

== Combining lists ==

Lists can be combined in several ways. The easiest is just to 'add' them. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2] + [3,4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way to combine lists is with &lt;b&gt;extend&lt;/b&gt;.  If you need to combine lists inside of a lambda, &lt;b&gt;extend&lt;/b&gt; is the way to go.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [4,5,6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.extend(b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&lt;/source&gt;

The other way to append a value to a list is to use '''append'''. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; p=[1,2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.append([3,4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; p
[1, 2, [3, 4]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; # or
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p
[1, 2, [3, 4]]
&lt;/source&gt;

However, [3,4] is an element of the list, and not part of the list. '''append''' always
adds one element only to the end of a list. So if the intention was to concatenate two lists,
always use '''extend'''.

== Getting pieces of lists (slices) ==

=== Continuous slices ===

Like [[Python Programming/Strings|strings]], lists can be indexed and sliced.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [2, 4, &quot;usurp&quot;, 9.0,&quot;n&quot;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[2]
'usurp'
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[3:]
[9.0, 'n']
&lt;/source&gt;

Much like the slice of a string is a substring, the slice of a list is a list.  However, lists differ from strings in that we can assign new values to the items in a list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[1] = 17
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[2, 17, 'usurp', 9.0,'n']
&lt;/source&gt;

We can even assign new values to slices of the lists, which don't even have to be the same length

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[1:4] = [&quot;opportunistic&quot;, &quot;elk&quot;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[2, 'opportunistic', 'elk', 'n']
&lt;/source&gt;

It's even possible to append things onto the end of lists by assigning to an empty slice:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[:0] = [3.14,2.71]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[3.14, 2.71, 2, 'opportunistic', 'elk', 'n']
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also completely change contents of a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[:] = ['new', 'list', 'contents']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
['new', 'list', 'contents']
&lt;/source&gt;

On the right-hand side of assignment statement can be any iterable type:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[:2] = ('element',('t',),[])
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
['element', ('t',), [], 'contents']
&lt;/source&gt;

With slicing you can create copy of list because slice returns a new list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; original = [1, 'element', []]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_copy = original[:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_copy
[1, 'element', []]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_copy.append('new element')
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_copy
[1, 'element', [], 'new element']
&gt;&gt;&gt; original
[1, 'element', []]
&lt;/source&gt;

but this is shallow copy and contains references to elements from original list, so be careful with mutable types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list_copy[2].append('something')
&gt;&gt;&gt; original
[1, 'element', ['something']]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Non-Continuous slices ===

It is also possible to get non-continuous parts of an array. If one wanted to
get every n-th occurrence of a list, one would use the :: operator. The syntax
is a:b:n where a and b are the start and end of the slice to be operated upon.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [i for i in range(10) ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[::2]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list[1:7:2]
[1, 3, 5]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Comparing lists ==

Lists can be compared for equality.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2] == [1,2]
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2] == [3,4]
False
&lt;/source&gt;

Lists can be compared using a less-than operator, which uses lexicographical order:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2] &lt; [2,1]
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; [2,2] &lt; [2,1]
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] &lt; [&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;]
True
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sorting lists ==

Sorting lists is easy with a sort method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [2, 3, 1, 'a', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b']
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the list is sorted in place, and the sort() method returns '''None''' to emphasize this side effect.

If you use Python 2.4 or higher there are some more sort parameters:

sort(cmp,key,reverse)

cmp : method to be used for sorting
key : function to be executed with key element. List is sorted by return-value of the function
reverse : sort(reverse=True) or sort(reverse=False)

Python also includes a sorted() function.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [5, 2, 3, 'q', 'p']
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(list)
[2, 3, 5, 'p', 'q']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[5, 2, 3, 'q', 'p']
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that unlike the sort() method, sorted(list) does not sort the list in place, but instead returns the sorted list. The sorted() function, like the sort() method also accepts the reverse parameter.

==Iteration==
Iteration over lists:

Read-only iteration over a list, AKA for each element of the list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for item in list1:
  print item
&lt;/source&gt;

Writable iteration over a list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for i in range(0, len(list1)):
  list1[i]+=1 # Modify the item at an index as you see fit
print list
&lt;/source&gt;

From a number to a number with a step:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for i in range(1, 13+1, 3): # For i=1 to 13 step 3
  print i
for i in range(10, 5-1, -1): # For i=10 to 5 step -1
  print i
&lt;/source&gt;

For each element of a list satisfying a condition (filtering):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for item in list:
  if not condition(item):
    continue
  print item
&lt;/source&gt;

See also [[../Loops#For_Loops]].

==Removing==

Removing aka deleting an item at an index (see also [[#pop(i)]]):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list.pop() # Remove the last item
list.pop(0) # Remove the first item , which is the item at index 0
print list

list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
del list[1] # Remove the 2nd element; an alternative to list.pop(1)
print list
&lt;/source&gt;

Removing an element by value:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]
list.remove(&quot;a&quot;) # Removes only the 1st occurrence of &quot;a&quot;
print list
&lt;/source&gt;

Keeping only items in a list satisfying a condition, and thus removing the items that do not satisfy it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
newlist = [item for item in list if item &gt;2]
print newlist
&lt;/source&gt;
This uses a [[#List comprehensions|list comprehension]].

==Aggregates==
There are some built-in functions for arithmetic aggregates over lists. These include minimum, maximum, and sum:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print max(list), min(list), sum(list)
average = sum(list) / float(len(list)) # Provided the list is non-empty
# The float above ensures the division is a float one rather than integer one.
print average
&lt;/source&gt;
The max and min functions also apply to lists of strings, returning maximum and minimum with respect to alphabetical order:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [&quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;]
print max(list), min(list) # Prints &quot;ab aa&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Copying==
Copying AKA cloning of lists:

Making a shallow copy:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1= [1, 'element']
list2 = list1[:] # Copy using &quot;[:]&quot;
list2[0] = 2 # Only affects list2, not list1
print list1[0] # Displays 1

# By contrast
list1 = [1, 'element']
list2 = list1
list2[0] = 2 # Modifies the original list
print list1[0] # Displays 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The above does not make a deep copy, which has the following consequence:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = [1, [2, 3]] # Notice the second item being a nested list
list2 = list1[:] # A shallow copy
list2[1][0] = 4 # Modifies the 2nd item of list1 as well
print list1[1][0] # Displays 4 rather than 2
&lt;/source&gt;

Making a deep copy:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import copy
list1 = [1, [2, 3]] # Notice the second item being a nested list
list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1) # A deep copy
list2[1][0] = 4 # Leaves the 2nd item of list1 unmodified
print list1[1][0] # Displays 2
&lt;/source&gt;

See also [[#Continuous slices]].

==Clearing==
Clearing a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
del list1[:] # Clear a list
list1 = []   # Not really clear but rather assign to a new empty list
&lt;/source&gt;

Clearing using a proper approach makes a difference when the list is passed as an argument:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def workingClear(ilist):
  del ilist[:]
def brokenClear(ilist):
  ilist = [] # Lets ilist point to a new list, losing the reference to the argument list
list1=[1, 2]; workingClear(list1); print list1
list1=[1, 2]; brokenClear(list1); print list1
&lt;/source&gt;

Keywords: emptying a list, erasing a list, clear a list, empty a list, erase a list.

==Removing duplicate items==
Removing duplicate items from a list (keeping only unique items) can be achieved as follows.

If each item in the list is hashable:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = [1, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1]
visited = set()
i = 0
while i &lt; len(list1):
  if list1[i] in visited:
    list1.pop(i)
    continue
  visited.add(list1[i])
  i+=1
&lt;/source&gt;

If some items are not hashable, the set of visited items can be kept in a list:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = [1, 4, 4, [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], 5, [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], 3, 2, 3, 2, 1]
visited = []
i = 0
while i &lt; len(list1):
  if list1[i] in visited:
    list1.pop(i)
    continue
  visited.append(list1[i])
  i+=1
&lt;/source&gt;

If each item in the list is hashable and preserving element order does not matter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list1 = [1, 4, 4, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1]
list1 = list(set(list1))
&lt;/source&gt;

== List methods ==

=== append(x) ===

Add item ''x'' onto the end of the list.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list.append(4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&lt;/source&gt;

See [[#pop(i)|pop(i)]]

=== pop(i) ===

Remove the item in the list at the index ''i'' and return it. If ''i'' is not given, remove the the last item in the list and return it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = list.pop(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = list.pop()
&gt;&gt;&gt;list
[2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
4
&lt;/source&gt;

== operators ==

=== in ===
The operator 'in' is used for two purposes; either to iterate over every item in a list in a for loop, or to check if a value is in a list returning true or false.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; if 3 in list:
&gt;&gt;&gt;    ....
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 in l
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 18 in l
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;for x in l:
&gt;&gt;&gt;    print x
0
1
2
3
4

&lt;/source&gt;

==Subclassing==
In a modern version of Python [which one?], there is a class called 'list'. You can make your own subclass of it, and determine list behaviour which is different from the default standard.

== Exercises ==
#Use a list comprehension to construct the list ['ab', 'ac', 'ad', 'bb', 'bc', 'bd'].
#Use a slice on the above list to construct the list ['ab', 'ad', 'bc'].
#Use a list comprehension to construct the list ['1a', '2a', '3a', '4a']. 
#Simultaneously remove the element '2a' from the above list and print it.
#Copy the above list and add '2a' back into the list such that the original is still missing it.
#Use a list comprehension to construct the list ['abe', 'abf', 'ace', 'acf', 'ade', 'adf', 'bbe', 'bbf', 'bce', 'bcf', 'bde', 'bdf']

&quot;Globalisation Essay
By Rweasle

	This essay will say that American cultural products success in the international market reflects only the products popularity, and not that American products are popular because of the culture they stem from, that of America. It will show that this is true for several reasons. The first reason is that, due to America’s economic status, emphasis on capitalism and even the “American dream” make it an ideal place for new products to flourish and those that are exposed to the foreign markets are the best of these, leading to a sort of “commercial Darwinism’s these products success is not due to the popularity of American culture. The second reason for the success of American products in the foreign market is that the products that America exports are well managed because those who run them are well educated and are the best because of more “commercial Darwinism”.  This means that American products are successful in foreign markets and this success is not because American culture is dominant. The third reason relates to American films and media. This is an area where American culture contributes to the popularity of the products, but even though this is true there are several cultures that have similar cultures (on a global scale) and compete with America.

	One of the reasons American products are popular is that the products that are encountered in international markets are the best of the huge number of products created in America. An example of this is the Oreo biscuit. This product, available in many countries is one of the best of a huge number of chocolate biscuits produced in America. This excellent product would then be likely to succeed and become popular overseas. A second example is the star wars series, one of the most popular series of movies ever, came from America. One of the main reasons for the success of this movie is partly due to the fact that of all the actors, screenwriters and directors available to do star wars, some of the best were chosen and therefore this contributed to star wars’ commercial success. Both of these products are assisted by the social and commercial status of America. The social environment is capitalist and this encourages people to try to create new products. This is a manifestation of the American dream, that you can start with little and create wealth and this social atmosphere contributes to the number of people who create products, of which the best are exported and are often popular overseas. The economic status of America also contributes to the number of products that it produces. Most Americans have enough money to begin businesses and this means there are more products to export and therefore it is more likely that American products will succeed in overseas markets.

	
Another reason American products are popular overseas is that those who manage them are often well educated Americans. These people are well educated because of America’s economic position. Most Americans are educated and of these only the best are appointed to important jobs, so these people will be the best and commercial Darwinism will have come into play with only the best in important jobs, and as a result of this American companies are often well managed. An example of this is the head of general electric, a successful American company, Jeffrey R. Immelt who has a B.A. in applies mathematics from Dartmouth College and a M.B.A. from Harvard.

America dominates the media industry because its culture is popular and because they produce many films because they appeal to a large demographic. America does not have an extremely unique culture and is similar to Australia’s, the U.K.’s and many other western countries and the only reason the dominate this industry is because of the large pool of people who want to be involved in the media industry. Because of this America has produces many famous films and dominates the global media network. If Australia or the U.K. had as many people as America it would probably dominate the global media market because each of these countries has a large population and all these countries have similar (compared to other countries) cultures so that country would dominate the media market. America’s economic status also helps because it gives directors enough money to produce good films.

These factors show than American products dominate international markets, not because of the popularity of American culture, but because of the large population of Americans with ideas which give the industry a large number of potential products for export, including media, so only the best go overseas so these are popular. America dominates because of its economic status, which gives many Americans the capacity to go into business and, should they succeed, export their products. America’s social environment also helps make Americans more eager to go into business because of the belief that they can succeed so they are more likely to develop new products, some of which are exported and may succeed in other markets. This means that American products, except for media, are popular because they are of good quality, not because American culture is favoured over others.

note that this essay was writen for school and got 17/20 but i was told i was to left wing?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Buddhist Theology==

This page lists &quot;Buddhist Theology&quot; as a &quot;major&quot; theology. There is no such thing as a Buddhist theology. Buddhism is a non-theistic religion. It neither believes in god nor denies its existence. Where there is no ''theos'', there can be no ''theology'' To talk about a Buddhist theology is absurd.

Whenever asked about god, the Buddha always answered by complete silence, until one day he must have gotten tired of hearing the same question, so he replied with a story:

:A man was shot by a poisoned arrow. The doctor came and was about ready to pull the arrow out of the wound, but the patient stopped his hand and said: ''&quot;Wait, doctor, before you pull the arrow out, tell me about the man who shot me. Was he tall or was he short? Was he from a warrior caste or from a brahmin caste or from a lower caste? Was he young or was he old? Was he of dark skin or of light skin?&quot;'' And many other questions he asked. If the doctor had to answer his questions first, the patient would die. So, the doctor just pulled the arrow out and took care of the wound. The patient got all his answers after he recovered.

:Similarly, said the Buddha, I will not answer your question. I am here to help you heal from spiritual darkness. If you waste your time on silly speculations, you will never recover, you will die a spiritual death. Take care of awaken from the cycle of rebirth, you will get your answers after you realize nirvana.

So, there. There is no such thing as a Buddhist theology. [[User:Red Prince|Red Prince]] 19:21, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== It all depends on the meaning of &quot;Theology&quot; ==

Princeton University's [http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/ WordNet] explains theology as:

:#theology, divinity -- (the rational and systematic study of religion and its influences and of the nature of religious truth)
:#theology, theological system -- ('''a particular system or school of religious beliefs and teachings'''; &quot;Jewish theology&quot;; &quot;Roman Catholic theology&quot;)
:#theology -- (the learned profession acquired by specialized courses in religion (usually taught at a college or seminary); &quot;he studied theology at Oxford&quot;)

This would seem to imply that the term ''theology'', while undoubtably steming from the Greek words &amp;theta;&amp;eta;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (god) and &amp;lambda;&amp;omicron;&amp;gamma;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (knowledge) has evolved in contemporary usage to explain all systems of belief.
[[User:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]] 19:51, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

And none of the three definitions you quoted have anything to do with Buddhism. Anyway, if you want to have a &quot;Buddhist theology&quot; section, no Buddhist in the world is going to stop you, but neither is he going to take it seriously. [[User:Red Prince|Red Prince]] 21:57, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:All this over a simple link! If you don't think there should be a &quot;Buddhist Theology&quot; page, then just edit the page and delete that link! I wasn't trying to make any sort of point; I just thought of a few religions and put them there. Better yet, if you want to start those pages, go ahead; both of you seem to be very knowledgable in this area. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:48, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I would like to do this. But what I have in mind is a three book series:

1) Philsophy of religion in which I discuss the various approaches to issues in religion.

2) Comparative religion, in which I tell stories from the different relgions and analyze the various threads concerning various elements of religions.

3) Descriptive religion, where I simply describe many of the world religions (would it even be possible to be complete?).

If that sounds okay, I'll be developing an outline over the next few days. As with &lt;i&gt;Effective Reasoning&lt;/i&gt;, I'm not fluent in producing Wikibook code and will be glad for any help in that area.[[User:WolfVanZandt|WolfVanZandt]] 03:48, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

I have changed the name of this book under the Religion category to &quot;Theology 1: Philosophy of Religion&quot; and have added &quot;Theology 2: Comparative Religion&quot; and &quot;Theology 3: Descriptive Religion&quot;. If it is acceptible to all involved, I will come back later and delete this stub. [[User:WolfVanZandt|WolfVanZandt]] 03:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

Rhubarb may be an intimidatingly tart vegetable eaten on its own, but when its sharp flavor is tempered with the addition of butter and sugar, it makes excellent desserts such as the cake recipe below.

==Ingredients==
*1 1/2 C. raw sliced thin [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]]
*1 1/2 C. [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1/2 C [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 C. sour [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
*2 C. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/4 C. [[Cookbook:Baking Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

==Procedure==
#Cream the brown sugar and butter, add egg and salt. 
#Stir in the milk, soda, vanilla, and flour. After blended add the rhubarb and stir till mixed in. 
#Pour into greased 9x13 pan and sprinkle top with mixture of 1/4 C. sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon that has been mixed together. 
#Bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes.

== European exploration in 1000 BC? ==

There's a phrase that states &quot;...archaeologists discovered remains at La'Anse aux Meadows dating back to about 1000 BC.&quot;  I was just curious as to whether or not that is supposed to be AD/BCE.  I myself don't really know, but it doesn't make sense with the rest of the section if the remains dated from ~2000 years before the Vikings reached North America.

== Move to delete ==

This section is unnecessary and I think it should be deleted [[User:Geo.plrd|Geo.plrd]] ([[User talk:Geo.plrd|talk]]) 17:04, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

== Myth of Filth ==

Whoever compiled this history had a lot of myths in the tuckerbag. The Middle Ages were in some ways cleaner than, say, the 18th century. They had bath houses, they had laws against food adulteration or serving rotten flesh, and chamber pots were dumped in cesspits, not in the public street. I wish the author had relied on actual histories, and not on a &quot;gross history&quot; book. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 20:35, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

== Bloody Vikings! I'd like permission . . .  ==

May I move some material on the Viking exploration to the later section on Exploration? While there is much room in cyberspace, redundancy is bad. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 19:08, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

== May I change a section? ==

A query to the powers that be: may I submerge the current sections about Portugal and the Hundred Years War in a new section about the rise of nation states? Though the topic seems needlessly determinist, it is broader than the current headings, and more fitting for a history of an America settled by contending nations. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 11:51, 6 April 2014 (UTC)

== More maps? ==

We are talking about more than a thousand years, with many political changes. Could someone bring in more maps? It would be nice to have one of the Holy Roman Empire at its medieval height, one of the movements of Irish monks, and a third of the incursions of Islam in Europe. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 21:38, 9 April 2014 (UTC)

== Must there be &quot;The New World&quot;? ==

Some of the material in this section can be put in other sections. Columbus is treated in the very next chapter. May I eliminate this section? [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 22:05, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

I am ignorant on this topic. Can anybody write something for here? [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 19:34, 17 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

I noticed your additions to the [[Cookbook]], and wanted to thank you and ask that you continue making such usefull contributions.  If you need [[Wikibooks:Help|help]], post a question at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]] or ask me on [[User talk:Gentgeen|my talk page]].

Good luck!&lt;br/&gt;
[[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

P.S. One last helpful hint. To sign your posts like I did above (on talk pages, for example) use the '~' symbol. To insert just your name, type &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (3 tildes), or, to insert your name and timestamp, use &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; (4 tildes).

==Cooking techniques==


Good job finding that PD source for cooking techniques.  It really fills in one of the glaring holes in the cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 04:16, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)

==Wikipedia recipes==

If you know the title you want to use in the cookbook, just copy and paste the contents into the wikibooks location.  You then need to either list the authors in the edit summary (if it's only one or two), or copy the page history of the wikipedia article into the wikibooks module's talk page.  Then list it for deletion at wikipedia.  If you don't know the title you want to use, [[m:transwiki|transwiki]] it here, using the naming format &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Transwiki:{WIKIPEDIA TITLE}]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;, then leave a note on the [[Wikibooks:Transwiki log]], so we'll know it's there.  Oh, and thanks for finding the recipes, eventually we'll get them all over here. (whether Anthere like it or not :)). [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:08, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:The recipes look good.  Thanks for the hard work. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 06:52, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

==Wikipedia dumps==
We're discussing establishing an expansion to [[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not]], that would clearly state that Wikibooks is not simply a place to dump content not wanted at wikipedia.  The discussion is going on at the [[Wikibooks talk:What Wikibooks is not|talk page]].  As to how to let wikipedians know we're not their recycling bin, I'm not sure what to do. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:35, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

The placement of this recipe should be in the Midwestern Cuisine section.
:I'm not sure which recipe is being refered to here.  Please let me know and I'll add or change something, or even better, you can change it and tell me what you did. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:50, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Thanks for the help at the rhetoric and composition textbook. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:30, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

:Done.  I have also found that the type of mustard makes a difference on how sharp it is.  Only &quot;Coleman&quot; mustard powder seems to make it as sharp as I like it. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]]

__NOTOC__
Traditionally eaten at ''braais'', barbecues, '''boerewors''' (Afrikaans: farmer's sausage) are thick, hearty and flavoursome Afrikaner sausages, often eaten with a [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] porridge called ''pap''.

There is no one definitive recipe for boerewors, as nearly every family has its own variation. Some other recipes use bacon and springbok meat.

This version uses a sausage maker, and makes about 6lb of sausage.

==Ingredients==
*2 lb [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*2 lb [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]]
*2 lb [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
*¼ lb. [[Cookbook:Spek|spek]]
*1½ Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp. ground black pepper.
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]], singed[[Cookbook:Boerewors#Singeing coriander|¹]] and ground
*¼ tsp ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*½ tsp grated [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*½ tsp ground [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
*½ cup brown [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1½ [[Cookbook:Brandy]] (optional)
*2¼ wide [[Cookbook:Sausage casing|sausage casings]]

==Singeing coriander==
Singed coriander is often used to spice Afrikaner dishes.
#Place seeds into a dry frying pan.
#Put the pan onto low heat and allow coriander to burn slightly.
#Break seeds apart with a fork.
Use a coffee grinder instead off a fork; for this quantity of meat, add 50ml to 60ml of coriander.

==Procedure==
#Cut all meat and spek into cubes.
#Mix spek and meat together thoroughly, and then coarsely [[Cookbook:Mincing|mince]].
#Add all dry spices, vinegar, and if used, brandy.
#Mix together lightly with a large, two-pronged fork.
#Place the casings in water.
#Place mixture in fridge for 2 hours to blend the flavours together, leaving the casings to soak for the same time.
#Fit casings over sausage maker, and fill with the meat/spice mixture. Be very careful not to over- or understuff the boerewors, as doing so will ruin them. Fill in long continuous lengths, don't make links. 
#Cook on a barbecue, but do not prick to allow juices to escape as much of the flavour will escape with them. Cook until still pink and juicy inside
#Boerewors can be stored for up to 3 weeks frozen.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Add about 100 ml of regular oatmeal &amp;ndash; this helps to bind the meat. 
* Be careful not to over spice the mince, you will ruin the taste. 
* Be careful with adding salt, the spek has plenty as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Trigonometric equations''' are equations including trigonometric functions.  If they have only such functions and constants, then the solution involves finding an unknown which is an argument to a trigonometric function.

== Basic trigonometric equations ==

=== sin ''x'' = n ===

&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; float: right&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| [[Image:Sin unit circle.svg|300px]]
|-
! &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\sin x=n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left|n\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x=\alpha + 2 k \pi \\
x=\pi - \alpha + 2 k \pi \\
\alpha \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{2};\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=-\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}+2k\pi&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}+2k\pi&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left|n\right|&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x\in\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

The equation &lt;math&gt;\sin x=n&lt;/math&gt; has solutions only when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is within the interval [-1;&amp;nbsp;1]. If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is within this interval, then we first find an &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sin^{-1} n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions are then:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\alpha + 2 k \pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\pi - \alpha + 2 k \pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

In the cases when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equals 1, 0 or -1 these solutions have simpler forms which are summarized in the table on the right.

For example, to solve:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \frac{x}{2}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

First find &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\sin^{-1}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}=\frac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Then substitute in the formulae above:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{2}=\frac{\pi}{3} + 2 k \pi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{2}=\pi - \frac{\pi}{3} + 2 k \pi&lt;/math&gt;

Solving these linear equations for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gives the final answer:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{2\pi}{3}\left(1+6k\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(1+3k\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== cos ''x'' = n ===

&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; float: right&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| [[Image:Cos unit circle.svg]]
|-
! &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\cos x=n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left|n\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x=\pm\alpha + 2 k \pi \\
\alpha \in \left[0;\pi\right]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=\pi+2k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=2k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\left|n\right|&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x\in\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Like the sine equation, an equation of the form &lt;math&gt;\cos x=n&lt;/math&gt; only has solutions when n is in the interval [-1;&amp;nbsp;1]. To solve such an equation we first find one angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\cos^{-1}n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the solutions for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\pm\alpha+2k\pi \, \!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

Simpler cases with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equal to 1, 0 or -1 are summarized in the table on the right.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== tan ''x'' = n ===

&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; float: right&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| [[Image:Tan unit circle.svg]]
|-
! &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\tan x=n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| General &lt;br/&gt; case
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x=\alpha + k\pi \\
\alpha \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{2};\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=-\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{4}\end{matrix}+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{4}\end{matrix}+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

An equation of the form &lt;math&gt;\tan x=n&lt;/math&gt; has solutions for any real &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. To find them we must first find an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\tan^{-1}n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

After finding &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the solutions for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\alpha+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equals 1, 0 or -1 the solutions have simpler forms which are shown in the table on the right.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== cot ''x'' = n ===

&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left: 1em; float: right&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;
|colspan=&quot;2&quot;| [[Image:Cot unit circle.svg]]
|-
! &lt;math&gt;n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\cot x=n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| General &lt;br/&gt; case
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x=\alpha + k\pi \\
\alpha \in \left[0;\pi\right]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=-\begin{matrix}\frac{3\pi}{4}\end{matrix}+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;n=1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x=\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{4}\end{matrix}+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

The equation &lt;math&gt;\cot x=n&lt;/math&gt; has solutions for any real &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. To find them we must first find an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\cot^{-1}n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

After finding &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the solutions for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\alpha+k\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equals 1, 0 or -1 the solutions have simpler forms which are shown in the table on the right.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== csc ''x'' = n and sec ''x'' = n ===

The trigonometric equations  csc ''x'' = n and sec ''x'' = n can be solved by transforming them to other basic equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\csc x=n\Leftrightarrow\frac{1}{\sin x}=n\Leftrightarrow\sin x=\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sec x=n\Leftrightarrow\frac{1}{\cos x}=n\Leftrightarrow\cos x=\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

== Further examples ==

Generally, to solve trigonometric equations we must first transform them to a basic trigonometric equation using the [[../Trigonometric_Identities_Reference|trigonometric identities]]. This sections lists some common examples.

=== ''a'' sin ''x'' + ''b'' cos ''x'' = ''c'' ===

To solve this equation we will use the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;a \sin x + b \cos x = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \sin \left(x + \alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \begin{cases} \tan^{-1} \left(b / a\right), &amp; \mbox{if } a &gt; 0 \\ \pi + \tan^{-1} \left(b / a\right), &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \sin \left(x + \alpha\right) = c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin{\left(x + \alpha\right)} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is of the form &lt;math&gt;\sin x = n&lt;/math&gt; and can be solved with the formulae given above.

For example we will solve:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin 3 x - \sqrt{3}\cos 3 x = -\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case we have:

:&lt;math&gt;a = 1, b = -\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + \left(-\sqrt{3}\right)^2} = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \tan^{-1} \left(-\sqrt{3}\right) = -\frac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Apply the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;2 \sin \left(3x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = -\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left(3x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

So using the formulae for &lt;math&gt;\sin x = n&lt;/math&gt; the solutions to the equation are:

:&lt;math&gt;3x - \frac{\pi}{3} = -\frac{\pi}{3} + 2 k \pi \Leftrightarrow x = \frac{2 k \pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3x - \frac{\pi}{3} = \pi + \frac{\pi}{3} + 2 k \pi \Leftrightarrow x = \frac{\pi}{9}\left(6k + 5\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A linked list is a simple way to store some unknown number of elements.  For example, you might need a program that will accept a bunch of numbers and then calculate the average.

You could dynamically allocate the array like this:

 int i;
 scanf(&quot;enter size of array to create: %d.\n&quot;, &amp;i);
 int *array = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * i);

Or this in C++:

 int i;
 cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter the size of the array to create:&quot;;
 cin &gt;&gt; i;
 int *array = new int[i];

However, it is often impossible to know beforehand how large the array needs to be. Resizing the array each time would require a memory allocation and a copy of all the elements, which is inefficient (although this can be negated through by resizing the array proportional to its current size, a technique used by the [[Standard Template Library]] Vector template)

You could do something like create an array big enough to cover all expected situations:

 int array[10000]; /* oughtta cover all situations. */

This is inefficiecnt, since it will always consume the size of 10,000 ints, which could be anywhere from 19Kb to 39Kb.

Enter the linked list.  A linked list is a growable container that allows fast insertion and deletion operations. This allows items to be appended to the end of the list without re-allocating the entire structure.


The structure of a linked list could be something like this
 typedef struct _ListItem {
   int data; //data to store here it is a integer
   struct _ListItem *next; //pointer to the next item's address in the list
 } ListItem;

Since the data type could be something else, it would be inconvenient to rewrite this every time it is needed for a different type, so this is generally implemented as a templated class in C++, C# or other languages that support [[generics]]. Encapsulating the linked list in a class as an [[abstract data type]] allows the idea of the head and tail to be abstracted away from the programmer. This also allows the basic operations to modify the head or tail as needed.

== Doubly Linked Lists == 
This is a specialized version of a linked list which allows traversal in two directions. A regular linked lists can only be traversed from head to tail. A doubly linked list allows the list to also be traversed from tail to head, at the expense of more memory and some slightly more expensive operations. With doubly linked lists, you need to keep track of the tail in addition to keeping track of the head.

== Operations ==

There are several elemental operations used with linked lists. Many of these operations use a position as a parameter. This parameter is a pointer to a ListItem, since the ListItem represents an item in the chain (including the link to the next item)

=== Insert ===

The insert operation takes a position and the new item to insert as parameters

&lt;pre&gt;
void insert(ListItem *position, ListItem *item)
{
   item-&gt;next = position-&gt;next;
   position-&gt;next = item;
   item-&gt;prev=front-&gt;prev;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Delete ===

The delete operation takes the position directly before the element we want to remove as the parameter. The reason we use the position immediately before is since with a singly linked list, there is no way to find the element directly before the position in order to update the link. If a generic delete function is required, this means that in order to delete the first item, a dummy head item must be used. This is one example of the advantages of a doubly linked list, since we can use a pointer to the actual item we want to remove, since there is a pointer to the previous item so we can update the links.

'''Singly-linked list version'''

&lt;pre&gt;
// position is immediately before the item we want to delete
void delete(ListItem *position)
{
   if(0 == position-&gt;next) return;
   ListItem* temp = position-&gt;next-&gt;next;
   free(position-&gt;next);
   position-&gt;next = temp;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Doubly-linked list version'''

&lt;pre&gt;
// position is the actual item we want to delete
void delete(DL_ListItem *position)
{
   if(position-&gt;next)
      position-&gt;next-&gt;prev = position-&gt;prev;
   if(position-&gt;prev)
      position-&gt;prev-&gt;next = position-&gt;next;
   free(position);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see, the doubly linked version is much more elegant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The Philosophy of Religion is the application of philosophical theories and arguments to religions and religious world views.  Given the multitude of philosophies and religions in the world, it is easy to see how complex this field can become.  

For the sake of clarity:
*[[w:God|God]] will refer to the concept of a single, omnipotent deity as referred to by monotheistic religions such as [[w:Christianity|Christianity]], [[w:Judaism|Judaism]], and [[w:Islam|Islam]].
*[[w:Devil|Devil]] will refer to the concept of a single, evil being who is opposed to [[w:God|God]].
*[[w:Deity|Deity]]/[[w:Deities|Deities]] will refer to the concept of one or many supernatural beings of various qualities.

==The Existence of God==
===Ontological Argument===
First suggested by [[w:Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm of Canterbury]], the ontological argument attempts to prove the existence of God based on God's status as the greatest conceivable being.  The argument is as follows:

# God is defined as the greatest conceivable being.
# A being which exists in reality is greater than a being which exists only in the mind.
# Either God exists in reality or he exists only in the mind.
# If God existed only in the mind, there would be a greater conceivable being: one with the same properties as God who also happened to exist in reality.
# Thus, God cannot exist only in the mind.
# Therefore, God exists in reality.

After its publication in Anselm's Monologion, the argument was criticized by a monk by the name of Gaunilo in &quot;Reply on Behalf of the Fool&quot;, in which he argues that the same form of argument could be used to produce absurd conclusions such as the existence of a perfect island.  The argument was later criticized by [[w:Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant]], who claimed that existence could not be predicated as a property of an object.

Contemporary versions of the ontological argument have been formulated by a variety of philosophers including [[w:Norman Malcolm|Norman Malcolm]] and [[w:Alvin Plantinga|Alvin Plantinga]].

===Cosmological Argument===
[[w:St. Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] ([[w:1225|1225]]-[[w:1274|1274]]) gave several different versions of this argument (known as the Five Ways) in his work [[w:Summa Theologica|Summa Theologica]].
====First Cause====
The First Cause argument states that since many things are caused, God must be the First Cause. This is the second of the five ways.
   
The general argument follows:
# Things exist that are caused.
# Nothing can be self-caused.
# There can't be an infinite regress of causes.
# There must be a first cause that was not caused itself.
# The word ''God'' means uncaused first cause.
# God exists. 
====Contingency====

# Every being is necessary or contingent.
# Not every being is contingent.
# There is a necessary being upon which contingent beings depend.
# ''God'' is defined as a necessary being upon which contingent beings depend.
# God exists.

===Teleological Argument===

[[w:William Paley|William Paley]] (1743-1805) provides the most famous version of this argument with his watchmaker analogy in his book Natural Theology (1802). Briefly, the watchmaker is to the watch as God is to the Universe. Just as the watch with all its complex workings must have been created or made by an intelligent designer, so must the Universe with its even more complex workings have been designed by an intelligent and powerful creator.

His argument was refuted by [[w:David Hume|David Hume]] (1711-1776) who believed the argument failed because it was too dependent on analogy and did not compare like to like. He also argued that we do not have knowledge of other universes to compare the design or lack thereof with our own.

Contemporary philosophers have devised several new forms of the teleological argument.  Teleological arguments based on biological design are the underpinnings of the [[w:Intelligent Design|Intelligent Design]] movement.  These have drawn much criticism from the scientific community as they usually rely on a denial of the theory of evolution.  There have also been arguments based on fine-tuning: the fact that physical constants that govern properties such as the strength of the gravitational and electromagnetic forces are precisely the values necessary for intelligent life.  Critics have responded with arguments based on the [[w:Anthropic Principle|Anthropic principle]], which points out that these constants must have values compatible with our existence or else we wouldn't be here to measure them.

===Other Arguments===
Philosophers have come up with a wide variety of arguments and argumentative strategies for the existence of God including:

* The purported existence and unexplainability of miracles and near-death experiences.
* The argument that transcendent moral facts require the backing of God to have any force.
* The [[w:Transcendental argument for the existence of God|transcendental argument for the existence of God]] which argues that the existence of logic requires God.
* [[w:Pascal's wager|Pascal's wager]] which argues that it is rational to believe in God even if he doesn't exist because of the benefits in doing so in the afterlife. This is not so much an argument for the existence of God as an argument for the benefits in believing in God.

Needless to say, these arguments are disputed by many and are often extremely complex.

==The Nature of God==
===Theism===

Theism is the general belief that Deity exists, but the qualities of Deity are not specified.

===Monotheism===

Monotheism is the belief that a single God exists.  God is often seen as being [[w:omnipotent|omnipotent]], [[w:omniscient|omniscient]], and [[w:omnibenevolent|omnibenevolent]].

===Polytheism===

Polytheism is the belief that many deities exist.  Religions such as [[w:Asatru|Asatru]], [[w:Shinto|Shinto]], and [[w:Hinduism|Hinduism]] are considered polytheistic.

===Deism===
Deism is the belief that God exists purely on a rational basis, with no reliance on faith-based religions, including Christianity. Therefore, such ideas as the Trinity and the Incarnation are, strictly speaking, not present in Deism. However, most Deists lean towards some religious influence; some Christianity, others Hinduism, others Paganism, and so on.
Deists also tend to assert that the 'supreme being', whether they choose to call it God or not, created the universe and afterwards disassociated itself from the order of things. In deistic thought, God is the cause and the world is the effect; He is separate from it, and does not influence it.
In 17th century England, a Deist movement began, including Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Charles Blount, and others.
Some famous Deists include Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.



===Pantheism===
&quot;All is God&quot;. Any religious practice or philosophy that holds that all matter and physical forces are synonymous with God.  Pantheists believe that all physical reality is God. Pantheists believe that the whole of the cosmos is sacred and that nature is divine.

===Panentheism===
Hold that God is separate from the universe and that Pantheism is impossible because {all} cannot be God if God is apart from it

===Atheism===
There are two forms of atheism, called strong atheism and weak atheism (sometimes called positive and negative atheism or gnostic and agnostic atheism).  The former is defined as the positive belief that no god(s) exist, whereas the latter is characterized by denying or witholding assent to the positive assertion that their is/are god(s).  Thus, strong atheism is a stronger statement than weak atheism, as it requires positive evidence for atheism, as opposed to weak atheism which requires only a lack of evidence for theism.

Thus, one does not necessarily need to believe ''anything'' to be an atheist.  Anybody who does not believe in god is, by the definitions commonly held by the atheistic community, an atheist, whether s/he believes there is no god or whether s/he simply is not convinced that there is one.

Strictly speaking, the positive assertion that &quot;no gods exist&quot; is an unprovable assertion but, since all that is required of the Theist is a '''belief''' that the statement &quot;God(s) exist(s)&quot; is true and not irrefutable knowledge then it seems unreasonable to demand stronger justifaction from the atheist.  However, this would seem to undermine the difference between &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; atheism unless these positions are to be judged on the balance of probability that the speaker gives to such statements.  This in no way lessens the position of the atheist.  For example, there are many unprovable statements, from those made about the existence of fairies to those concerning the existence of the pagan pantheon that we discount on a daily basis but can never, in fact, show to be false.  The atheist puts statements about the existence of god in the same category.

==Other Topics==
===Problem of Evil/Theodicy===

The Problem of Evil is the problem of reconciling belief in a God who is benevolent or just with the universe, which has many apparent 'evils'. 

A common theist response is the argument that humans were created with free will, and that it is humanity as opposed to God who is reponsible for evil's prescence in the universe.

However, this argument is only a partial refuation. It does not cover natural disasters, for example, or anything else beyond human control.

Initial text adapted from [[en:Wikipedia:Reference desk]]. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 09:08 2 Aug 2003 (UTC)

== Discussion ==

It's awfully sad that this page is in the sidebar but never visited, whereas for the Staff Lounge it is just the reverse.  What gives? [[User:Sj|Sj]] 22:14, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== This page doesn't get a lot of attention==

Maybe redirect it to the staff lounge? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:17, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

: You're right about the attention. I'm not too excited, however, in mixing the two pages together. The Staff lounge gets a lot of traffic already. There is no need to dump even more there.
: I suggest we change the [[Template:Wikibooks contact|navigation aid]] and the text in the [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]] to seperate the on-wiki and external contact methods better, and clear up the introductory text here so that people actually stick around. We might also advertise this in the Staff lounge (so much for my argument about hight traffic there &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt;). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 17:30, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

== Clarifying page purpose definition ==

I think we should define the purpose of this page more explicitly. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Study_help_desk&amp;oldid=679580 Currently] it is mostly states that it &quot;serves much the same function as a library reference desk.&quot; Then, however, it goes on with: &quot;Do you have a specific question that you want answered by Wikibooks? Then ask below!&quot; but asking general questions isn't quite the purpose of a library reference desk.

I propose we restrict this to being a reference desk &amp;mdash; restrict the questions to the books here at Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 22:01, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Deprecate ==

This page is now linked to from the [[Wikibooks:Reading room]], but still doesn't get much traffic. Requests for this type of page don't find their way to the other reading rooms. There really doesn't seem to be much demand for it. [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]] therefore be able to handle the occasional requests that belong here. I suggest that we deprecate this page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:05, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==

'''1. Need for Energy:'''
:All life processes requires energy. Animals obtain energy through the food consumed by them. Green plants can prepare their own food, which is called [[wikt:photosynthesis|photosynthesis]].

'''2. Sun - A prime energy source''':
[[image:Sun at dusk (2007-07-28).jpg|right|135px]]
:The prime source of energy to our world is the Sun. All living organisms depend directly or indirectly on the sun for their energy needs. Oil, Coal, gas, solar power, wave power and wind power all derive energy from the sun - which has reached the earth either now or in the past.

[[Category:GCSE Science]]
sun gives plants energy

==Types of Energy==

There are many types of energy; here are the main ones:

Potential (Chemical, Elastic, Gravitational, Nuclear) (Usually written a PE)
Heat 
Kinetic  (Usually written a KE)
Electrical 
Electro-magnetic</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is Valgrind? ===
Valgrind ([http://www.valgrind.org/downloads/current.html#current downloadable here]) is a utility for debugging programs for the x86 and x86-64 Linux platforms. It has recently become highly popular as it can be used to easily track down memory management and threading bugs that are hard to track down otherwise.

=== How to install it ===
There is a &quot;generic&quot; option, available on most systems, which involves compiling:

 user&gt; wget http://valgrind.org/downloads/valgrind-3.8.1.tar.bz2
 user&gt; bunzip2 valgrind-3.8.1.tar.bz2 
 user&gt; tar -xvf valgrind-3.8.1.tar
 user&gt; cd /valgrind-3.8.1
 user&gt; ./configure
 user&gt; make
 user&gt; su root
 root&gt; make install

On most Linux distributions, however, you can use the package management system. For example, in Debian GNU/Linux (and derivatives) simply run:
  apt-get install valgrind

=== How to use it ===
Valgrind can be run simply by prefixing the command line that you run with '''valgrind'''

  ./myprogram  -o option

  valgrind ./myprogram -o option

This simple test will check that the memory accesses with in the program are correct. Do not be surprised when you get messages about code that you know is not a problem.  This program tests every access and some programs are forgiving about existing errors. It is always worth fixing these extra errors because they will be impossible to track down when they do cause a breakage in code.

You may prefer to run valgrind and log to a text file, with the following options:
 valgrind --leak-check=full --freelist-vol=100000000 --log-file-exactly=log.txt -v ./myprogram

===How it works===
Valgrind is essentially an x86 machine-code interpreter.  In fact it runs as a just-in-time compiler converting the machine code to an internal language, instrumenting that language and and then code-generating
from that language.  Valgrind instruments the code to monitor memory allocation, deallocation, writes and reads, which lets it hold a bit-map of memory state.  hence it can report attempts to read data from memory that has never yet been written, or using recently-freed memory.  Under Valgrind a program will take something like 2-10 times longer than when run uninstrumented.

Callgrind is a related program that uses the same x86 interpreter technology to instrument the code to log routine calls and generate a file that can be analyzed to show time spent in various routines and the call paths involved.

'''Varenyky''' (singular ''varenyk''; in [[w:Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], ''&amp;#1074;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1077;&amp;#769;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1082;[&amp;#1080;]'') are a national [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ukraine|Ukrainian Cuisine]] dish. Some variants are also found in Belarusian, Russian and Polish cooking. Varenyky are similar to Polish [[Cookbook:Pierogi|pierogi]], Siberian [[Cookbook:Pelmeni|pelmeni]], and Italian [[Cookbook:Ravioli|ravioli]]. Varenyky, however, are of larger size and frequently have [[Cookbook:Cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] filling. Other typical fillings include mashed [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], or [[Cookbook:Berry|berries]].

During preparation, the filling is wrapped with dough, and then boiled for several minutes.  The name ''varenyk,'' in fact, simply means &quot;boiled thing&quot;, from the adjective ''варений'' (romanized, ''varenyj'').

Varenyky are very popular in Ukraine as a quick-fix dish.

'''Bengali''', or '''Bangla''', is an Indo-Aryan language spoken predominantly in Bangladesh and in the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura by approximately 200 million people. After Hindi, Bengali is the second most spoken language in the Indian subcontinent, and among the top 10 most spoken languages in the world. The language has a rich literary heritage and underwent a renaissance in the late 19th century.

=Preliminaries=

The examples of Bengali words, phrases, clauses and sentences used in this book are generally presented simultaneously in three written forms: one using the Bengali script, a transliterated version using Latin letters, and an English translation. 

The Bengali-to-Latin transliteration scheme is the one followed in the English Wikipedia and can be seen [[:w:Bengali_script#Romanization_reference|here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The t- test is the most powerful parametric test for calculating the significance of a small sample mean.

A one sample t-test has the following null hypothesis:

&lt;math&gt;H_0: \quad \mu=c&lt;/math&gt;

where the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; (mu) represents the population mean and c represents its assumed (hypothesized) value.  In statistics it is usual to employ Greek letters for population parameters and Roman letters for sample statistics. The  t-test is the small sample analog of the z test which is suitable for large samples.  A small sample is generally regarded as one of size n&lt;30.

A t-test is necessary for small samples because their distributions are not normal. If the sample is large (n&gt;=30) then statistical theory says that the sample mean is normally distributed and a z test for a single mean can be used.  This is a result of a famous statistical theorem, the Central limit theorem.

A t-test, however, can still be applied to larger samples and as the sample size n grows larger and larger, the results of a t-test and z-test become closer and closer. In the limit, with infinite degrees of freedom, the results of t and z tests become identical.

In order to perform a t-test, one first has to calculate the &quot;degrees of freedom.&quot; This quantity takes into account the sample size and the number of parameters that are being estimated.  Here, the population parameter, mu is being estimated by the sample statistic x-bar, the mean of the sample data.  For a t-test the degrees of freedom of the single mean is 
n-1. This is because only one population parameter (the population mean)is being estimated by a sample statistic (the sample mean).

 degrees of freedom (df)=n-1

''For example, for a sample size n=15, the df=14.   ''

=== Example ===

''A college professor wants to compare her students' scores with the national average. She chooses an SRS of 20 students, who score an average of 50.2 on a standardized test. Their scores have a standard deviation of 2.5. The national average on the test is a 60. She wants to know if her students scored '''significantly''' lower than the national average.''

Significance tests follow a procedure in several steps.

==== Step 1 ====

First, state the problem in terms of a distribution and identify the parameters of interest. Mention the sample. We will assume that the scores (X) of the students in the professor's class are approximately normally distributed with unknown parameters &amp;mu; and &amp;sigma;

==== Step 2 ====
State the hypotheses in symbols and words.

&lt;math&gt;H_O: \quad \mu=60&lt;/math&gt;

''The null hypothesis is that her students scored on par with the national average.''

&lt;math&gt;H_A: \quad \mu&lt;60&lt;/math&gt;

''The alternative hypothesis is that her students scored lower than the national average.''

==== Step 3 ====

Secondly, identify the test to be used. Since we have an SRS of small size and do not know the standard deviation of the population, we will use a one-sample t-test. 

The formula for the t-statistic T for a one-sample test is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\overline{X} - 60}{S/\sqrt{20}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean and S is the sample standard deviation. 

A quite common mistake is to say that the formula for the t-test statistic is: 

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is not a statistic, because &amp;mu; is unknown, which is the crucial point in such a problem. Most people even don't notice it. Another problem with this formula is the use of x and s. They are to be considered the sample statistics and not their values.

The right general formula is:

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\overline{X} - c}{S/\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''c'' is the hypothetical value for &amp;mu; specified by the null hypothesis.

(The standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size is known as the &quot;standard error&quot; of the sample.)

==== Step 4 ====
State the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. Under H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the statistic T will follow a Student's distribution with 19 degrees of freedom: &lt;math&gt;T \sim \tau\cdot(20-1) &lt;/math&gt;.

==== Step 5 ====
Compute the observed value t of the test statistic T, by entering the values, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\overline{x} - 60}{s/\sqrt{20}} = \frac{50.2 - 60.0}{2.5/\sqrt{20}} = \frac{-9.8}{2.5/4.47} = \frac{-9.8}{0.559} = -17.5&lt;/math&gt;

==== Step 6 ====
Determine the so-called p-value of the value t of the test statistic T. We will reject the null hypothesis for too small values of T, so we compute the left p-value:
:p-value &lt;math&gt; = P(T \leq t ;H_0) = P(T(19) \leq -17.5) \approx 0 &lt;/math&gt;
The Student's distribution gives &lt;math&gt;T(19)=1.729&lt;/math&gt; at probabilities 0.95 and degrees of freedom 19. The p-value is approximated at 1.777e-13.

==== Step 7 ====
Lastly, interpret the results in the context of the problem. The p-value indicates that the results almost certainly did not happen by chance and we have sufficient evidence to '''reject the null hypothesis.'''  ''The professor's students did score significantly lower than the national average.''

==The Code==
===Example 1===

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$c = 0;
while ($c &lt; 5) {
  echo $c++;
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Example 2===

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$myName=&quot;Fred&quot;;
while ($myName!=&quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;) 
{
  if ($myName==&quot;Fred&quot;)
  {
    $myName=&quot;Leslie&quot;;
  }
  else
  {
    $myName=&quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;;
  }
}
echo &quot;How did you know?\n&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Analysis==

===Example 1===
This is an example that prints the numbers from 0 to 4. $c starts out as 0. When the while loop is encountered, the expression ''$c &lt; 5'' is evaluated for truth. If it is true, it executes what is in the curly braces. The echo statement will print 0, and then add one to $c. The program will then go back to the top of the loop and check the expression again. Since it is true again, it will then return 1 and add one to $c. It will keep doing this until $c is equal to 5, where the statement ''$c &lt; 5'' is false. After that, it finishes.

===Example 2===
The first line of the program sets '''$myName''' to &quot;Fred&quot;. After that, the while statement checks if '''$myName''' equals &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;. The '''!=''' means 'does not equal', so the expression is true, and the while loop executes its code block. In the code block an ''if'' statement (see [[Programming:PHP:if_structure|previous chapter]]) checks, if it equals Fred. Since it does, it then reassigns '''$myName''' to equal &quot;Leslie&quot;. Then it skips the ''else'', since the ''if'' was true and evaluated. Then it reaches the end of the loop, so it goes back and checks if '''$myName''' does not equal &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;. Since it still doesn't, it's true, and then it goes into the loop again. This time, the ''if statement'' is false, so the else is executed. This sets '''$myName''' to &quot;Rumplestiltskin&quot;. We again get to the end of the loop, so it goes back, and checks. Since '''$myName''' does equal &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;, the ''while'' condition is false, and it skips the loop and continues on, where it echos, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

==New Concepts==

===Loops===

Loops are another important basic programming technique. Loops allow programs to execute the same lines of code repeatedly, this is important for many things in programs. In PHP you often use them to layout tables in HTML and other similar functions.

===Infinite Loops===

Loops can be very handy, but also very dangerous! '''Infinite loops''' are loops that fail to exit, causing them to execute until the program is stopped. This is caused when no matter what occurs during the loop, the condition will never become false and therefore never exit. For example, if Example 1 subtracted 1 from $c...

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$c=2;
while ($c &lt; 7) {
  $c--;
  echo $c;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

$c will always be less than 5, no matter what, so the loop will continue forever. This causes problems for those of us who don't have infinite time (or computer memory!). So, in that case, let's learn a handy dandy little bugger.

If you add 'break;' to a loop, the loop will end, no matter whether the condition is false or not.

===Parting Example===

Let's combine the two examples. Before moving on take a few moments to write out the steps this program goes through and what its output is.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$c = 1;
$myName=&quot;Fred&quot;;
while ($myName != &quot;Rumplestilskin&quot;) 
{
  if ($myName==&quot;Fred&quot;) 
  {
    $myName=&quot;Leslie&quot;;
  }
  else 
  {
    $myName=&quot;Marc&quot;;
  }

  $c++;

  if ($c==3) 
  {
    break;
  }
};
echo &quot;You lose and I get your baby!\n&quot;;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;!-- Whoever wrote this: you rock, and I want to know what you were smoking. --&gt;

In addition to using functions such as echo and print, you can also end your script, and anything beyond the end of the script will be output as normal HTML to the browser.  You can also restart your script whenever you want after you've closed the PHP tag.  Confused?  It's actually pretty simple.

Let's say you had a ''for'' loop to count up to five and output it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
 
echo(&quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
for($x = 1; $x &lt; 6; $x++)
{
  echo(&quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; . $x . &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;);
}
echo(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;);
 
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

While I would tend to use [[Programming:PHP:template|templates]] for larger pages that output a lot, we'll get to that later.  Remember how all your PHP scripts start with &lt;code&gt;&lt;?php&lt;/code&gt; and end with &lt;code&gt;?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;?  Those don't have to be the very start and end of your file.  In fact, PHP handles ending and restarting scripting just like if everything between the &lt;code&gt;?&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;?php&lt;/code&gt; tags were inside of an echo statement.

Thus, you could do something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 
 &lt;?php
 for($x = 1; $x &lt; 6; $x++)
 {
 ?&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;?php echo $x ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;?php
 }
 ?&gt;
 
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is actually a very common method of outputting variables in a script, especially if there is a lot of HTML surrounding the variables.  As I said before, I personally rarely ever do this, as in my opinion, using echo for smaller scripts keeps your code cleaner (and I would use templates for larger ones).  However, we want to cover most of the language here, so this is another method you could use.

Just a couple of suggestions: 
*please sign everything with four tilde characters like this &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; so that it is easier to tell who says what to whom. 
*Please be as specific as possible when complaining that the book is inadequate so that effort can be better focussed,
*consider putting placeholder chapter headings in the actual book.  I watch the contents page and all the pages I edit so I'll see the placeholders and try to expand them,
*If you just change the spelling of a few words or correct some grammar here and there please mark it as a minor edit.
[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 06:50:07, 2005-08-26 (UTC)

==Guidelines for contributors==

*Please capitalize VB code as in the VB IDE.  
*Remember that the book is about programming in VB Classic not VB.Net.  
*Prefix the names of all images with ''Visual Basic Classic''.  Please fix any instances that fail to follow this 'rule'.
*The book is laid out like a printed b&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;ook, everything is at the same level except for main page.  If you follow the Next link in the navigation template you should visit all the pages in the same order as they are found in the table of contents.
--[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 18:14, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

==To Do==
*Rework the contents page in [[Programming:Python|Python]] style perhaps. [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 13:34:41, 2005-09-04 (UTC)
*Add previous, next and Up navigation to each page using the prognav template? [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 13:34:41, 2005-09-04 (UTC)

==Too much like an encyclopaedia articla==

This seems more like a Wikipedia explaination than a wikibooks lesson. I came looking to learn something, but went away with a description. HELP! -[[User:Jeshii|Jeshii]] 03:34, 8 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Probably too late for you, but it is getting better.  [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 06:50:07, 2005-08-26 (UTC)

'''Reply''' Yeah.. It does look like a encyclopedic article rather than a book. But I'll try to add more examples to make it more tutorial-ish.[[User:EugeneH|EugeneH]] 20:42, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)
Okay. I'll probably add a new section in the future if I have time...

== Added some ==

I added the getting started section, this is my first Wiki work, so I hope I didn't mess anything up.

==Chapter Organization==
===Moving===
I think the Data types should have their own chapter. Beginner programmers shouldn't need to know it right away, and in depth like that should be saved for later in the book. Maybe after Data I/O?

==Level==
===Beginner's book?===
I think this book is way too hard for a beginner... They will soon lose interest. Maybe this book should have more on GUI(Graphical user interface), since that's what VB is mostly used for. If we really want to make this book an easy tutorial, a lot must be rewritten. At least the structure of the tutorial should look like something to this effect:&lt;br&gt;

 Introduction - what's the advantages and disadvantages of vb? (in layman's terms)
  VB is made to be very convenient and user-friendly.
  Tell them you can make a program in 5 minutes.
  What is event-driven programming? Give the reader some ideas about it. Take some screenshots.
  List some cool things VB is good at. i.e. games, applications with heavy GUI,
  APIs(you can use APIs to make beeping noise etc.)

 Exercise 1: Hello world
  How to create,save and compile your first program in VB
  Using Print statement to print &quot;hello world&quot;
  extension: using message boxes, using input boxes to make hello world

 Exercise 2: Make a calculator
  Tell them what they should know:
   Buttons, Click events, Variables (simple data types),
   Some built-in functions they need.
  After they're done, tell them what else they could add to make it better.

 Exercise 3: Simple text editor
  Tell readers what they need to know:
   Components - learn about rich text boxes
   More about functions, subroutines
  How to improve

 Exercise 4: First game
  Introduce:
   Keyboard events, pictureboxes, shapes, imageboxes, timer
   movement, game loop, random numbers(rnd and randomize),Types
  extension: music,winsock(for multiplayer games),classes(OOP)

 Exercise 5: how to make an extremely annoying program
  more on APIs, GUI,
 ...
 ...

*sigh* but you almost have to change everything... {{unsigned|EugeneH|5 January 2005}}
 
===its not impossibble===
Thats where I was going with the getting started, learning how to print. This does need to cater more to beginners, however, the advanced content should stay. Just as learning anything goes, it should be progressively harder. If you want to extend the &quot;getting started&quot; area with some examples, go ahead. After giving the user an idea of the VB layout and uses, then they can get into the advanced of loops and such. Once I do some more I hope to make alot more reference programs, like the blast effect and such. I appreciate your contribution though, but maybe we should have some direction? Are you OK with you making the Beginners area more extensive, and I go on with Loops and Data and all the good stuff? Also, we should add programs to the end of each section, showing a common application of the learned technique. {{unsigned|Batjew|6 January 2005}}

'''okay''' I'll extend the beginner's sections. The &quot;visual&quot; part. I think we should have more of those since VB is made for rapid application development... But the fundamentals certainly can't be ignored. {{unsigned|EugeneH|7 January 2005}}

== Just some standards ==

I got rid of any mention of file numbers in I/O, just thought it was confusing, also never heard the use of file number before :P Replaced it with channel number instead. Just keep this in mind when adding more for the sake of the reader. Any ideas on other things to make standard, so we're not using a bunch of different terms to confuse the reader?
{{unsigned|Batjew|6 January 2005}}

'''yes''' Yeah that's fine with me. I'll let you know in the future before changing any terms. 
I never heard of channels before either. But that makes it easier for the readers. {{unsigned|EugeneH|7 January 2005}}

'''Another note''' we need to make a standard for picture box names. I feel &quot;pic&quot; works fine, so if its ok with you, ALWAYS use pic.print and what not. {{unsigned|Batjew|7 January 2005}}

'''hmmm''' pic is fine for a picture box, but when &quot;Printing&quot;, it's easier to type &quot;print&quot; than &quot;pic.print&quot;. :/ It just &quot;prints&quot; on the current Form instead of a picture box. So why don't we all use print? {{unsigned|EugeneH|10 January 2005}}

'''nah''' I always thought that was sloppy and hard to read, pic.print is only 4 letters more :P
{{unsigned|Batjew|11 January 2005}}

== Random Numbers ==
Shouldn't the random numbers section mention &quot;ranzomize&quot;?
-Joshtek (from other Wikipedia){{unsigned|217.44.24.36|23 January 2005}}

This may be rather basic, but shouldn't you tell them how to find/get a Visual Basic editor?
{{unsigned|68.17.255.85|19 May 2005}}

== Credits and permissions ==

Not sure how material lifted from other works should be acknowledged but it seems a good idea to actually record any documentation regarding permissions.

Kevin, 

In answer to both emails. 

1. Copyright. All we would require is a general statement on the contents page, we certainly wouldn't wish the effort on you of somehow trying to keep track of AVDF content page by page... that would render it pretty much unusable I should have thought! A link to avdf.com would be nice if that doesn't cause any stress.

2. Licensing. Having reviewed your licensing arrangements, I can confirm that GUI Computing Pty Ltd, owner of all copyrights in the material contained both on avdf.com and in the GUI Coding standards, agrees for you to use our above referenced work under terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

3. Contribution. Keep me in the loop as the project moves forward. I shall mention it to my developers at our next meeting... these days, of course, most of them are .NET hotshots who consider VB &quot;legacy&quot;, but there are a couple who might be interested.

Finally, if you need anything in addition to the above, please yell. 

All the best, 

Mark

 I'm editing the Visual Basic book on WikiBooks
 (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Visual_Basic_Classic) and I
 wonder if I might include some of your articles in it. 
 
 Of course if you felt like contributing to the book yourself that would
 be even better.
 
 When I started adding to it I thought I would be one among many but it
 seems that VB6 programmers are a shy and retiring lot.

==Name of Wikibook==

===Name is not descriptive of the contents===
This wikibook would be better named Visual Basic 6 since that is the only version it talks about. There were five other versions of VB Classic for Windows and one for MS-DOS, so the contents of the book don't really live up to the title. The contents describe features which won't work in VBWin3 or earlier and both the 16-bit VB IDEs and the VBDOS IDE are completely different from the one described here. In order to make the book match the title you either need to add a lot more material on the different versions, or to change the title. A title change would be a lot less work.

Must admit that I like the content though. You've done a good job of describing VB6.

:You sound like a level headed and knowledgeable person; how about lending a hand?  Please at least create an account and sign your contributions with four tildes so that we can tell who says what :-)  I agree that the emphasis is on VB6 but most will work on VB5 and a lot on VB4.  As for VB3 and VB.DOS, I've never used them for more than the most trivial of tasks so i'm not really qualified.  If you could track down a tutorial on VB.DOS, VB3, etc. that is in the public domain ro get an author to relicense one then we could create several books.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:30, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

::Are we going to rename this book?  I think you would get more interest if the focus was narrowed to just VB6, especially if the title mentioned VB6. - [[User:Bevo|Bevo]] 22:38, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:::I renamed it Visual Basic Classic because it was originally just Visual Basic and I wanted to distinguish it from VB.NET.  The name VB Classic seems to be quite common now but I think you have a good point because it is mostly used by those who are already expert users.  For now I'll add a [[Programming:VB6|redirect page]] that uses VB6 in the title.  You said ''we'' in your first sentence, I hope that means you intend to take part :-) --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:26, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

==How do you search inside a Wikibook?==
With all the substructure to this Wikibook, I'm having trouble figuring out how to do a search within it (all of it, not just the current page). - [[User:65.119.52.66|65.119.52.66]] 19:37, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
:If you can think of a better structure I'm open to suggestions.  And if you ever find a way of confining a search to a specific book I'm sure a lot of people would love to know.  Probably best to discuss searching on this page: [[Wikibooks_talk:Searching]]  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:13, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== Visual Basic Classic suggested merge ==

[[User:Hagindaz]] has suggested that [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] should be merged with [[VB6 Command Reference]]?  I think that a better course would be for the contributor to [[VB6 Command Reference]] to add to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] but I might be biased.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 13:54, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:I meant that [[VB6 Command Reference]] should either be added as an appendix to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]], or have any useful content added to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]], then redirected. I found [[VB6 Command Reference]] as an orphaned module. Since both books are on the same subject, so I don't think there is any reason to have them both exist as separate books. I'm sorry I wasn't clear, you can't add notes to {{tl|merge}}. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 17:27, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the clarification.  I wonder if we can change the merge template to allow for a short explanation?  Anyway I added a note to the talk page of the contributor, perhaps he or she will get in touch.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:44, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:I've just taken a look at the merge templates.  In fact they do allow for ''optional reason'' to be added.  There are also mergeto and mergefrom templates that indicate which direction the content should move.  That was something I didn't know.  I'll try the exercise of changing the modules to add a reason for the merge.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:59, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost as soon as you start playing the guitar, you start meeting lots of other guitarists. Eventually, you will wind up playing with some of them, in some sort of informal ''jam sessions'', where friends play anything that tickles their fancy.

Playing with others is helped incredibly by having some basic knowledge of [[Music|music theory]] along with some amount of talent or skill. This is especially true if you intend to improvise a melody or chord progression. this section will provide the basics of considerate playing, along with some tips on how to keep playing interesting.

==The Makeup of a Band==

Even if you never intend to play in a large group of people, it's still important to know the basic divisions of a band, because you never know what might happen tomorrow. Learning about how a band works can also help you learn new songs from popular groups, as well as improve your knowledge of general music theory, and your appreciation for music.

As explained in the [[Guitar/Lead Guitar and Rhythm Guitar|lead guitar and rhythm guitar section]], guitar playing essentially breaks down to two, somewhat overlapping categories; rhythm and lead (sometimes called melody). In a band, the rhythm guitar is more generally associated with the drums, bass, background vocals and less prominent instruments, while the melody guitar would be related to the lead vocals or any other lead instrument.

Thus, when you are playing only with two people, almost immediately one player provides the chords and groove of a song, while another play contributes a melody that compliments the song's progression. With more people playing, this division becomes less strict, and players can shift from playing more of less prominent parts.

In general, it is almost always better to play with more than two people, because with more people, whatever piece you are playing is less likely to fall apart when the first person screws up. If you only play with one another person, consider including a metronome or a mp3 drum track in the background. Electronic accompaniment helps you keep a steady pace, and helps you learn to not &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;drag&quot; in the group.

==Proper Playing Attitudes==

The most important thing to remember about playing with others can be learned by carefully listening to any piece of recorded music: '''Every player contributes to the song with an appropriate tone and volume, and ''never'' plays in excess of that.''' Essentially this just means you shouldn't try to outplay and outshine everyone else in the group, because no one likes a showoff. It doesn't matter how good you are (or think you are), you should never play so much that it drowns everyone else out.

If not overplaying is the most important thing about jamming, then the second most important is '''listening'''. The key to improvisation is to listen to the interplay of all the other instruments, and to add to that whatever sounds best. Listening is, unfortunately, a very neglected skill among beginning musicians, and really, most musicians in general.

A common tendency, especially among those who have just begun to get a solid foundation in scale theory and technique, is to noodle around aimlessly on the fretboard with little or no regard for the shape of the song that is being played, or the structure of the arrangement. This is a ''huge'' mistake, and it leads to music that no one wants to listen to; worse yet, it does nothing to develop the musician who plays it.

Pay attention to the music that is being played around you. Add to it only when it is necessary. You should begin to hear the lines that you want to play before you play them.  What you are shooting for here is something akin to the old koan about sculpting: the figure is already in the marble, and you are just trying to release it.

It is also important to make sure that you do not take up too much &quot;space&quot; in the arrangement, which is to say, do not play so loudly that other instruments must fight to be heard.  This is especially a problem for rhythm guitarists in jam sessions, who must be careful not to drown out soloists.

==Staying in the Right Key==

Perhaps the most important thing to do when playing with others is to remember what key you are in. The &quot;key&quot; of a piece is essentially the scale of notes that the song uses, but it also affects what the correct chords are to play on each note. Suppose there is only yourself and another guitarist playing, and the other guitarist is playing rhythm. The chord progression they are playing determines the key of the song, which naturally suggests certain notes for you, the lead guitarist.

Even if you have absolutely no knowledge of music theory, everyone can generally tell when you play a wrong note. Although advanced players can often add in &quot;wrong&quot; notes for colour (known in [[Music|music theory]] as an accidental), for beginners it is important to know what notes are in what keys, so they can use the most appropriate notes.

For example, the rhythm guitarist might be playing a three chord [[Guitar/Blues|blues]] riff in the key of B minor. Even if you didn't know the key, often the first and last chord of a progression can be good indicators of commonly used keys. At the very least, the general tone of the progression will be enough to indicate if it is a major or minor key. in this case, once you knew the key, you could immediately start soling in any B minor scale, such as the B minor pentatonic scale. However, since music is creative, it is impossible to be &quot;limited&quot;, and you also have available a number of other soloing scales, like the pentatonic scale or any of the modes. For example, the Phrygian mode has traditionally been the &quot;Spanish scale&quot;. Modes are much more complex and require knowledge of music theory to get the most benefit from them.

==Improvising==

There is also a basic approach to improvising which is more simple than playing over a chord accompaniment. It also predates Western tuning systems and chords. It is produced by playing a moving melody on one higher-pitched string, while leaving a lower note ringing on another '''&quot;open&quot;''', or lower-pitched (unfretted) string. The static bass note is referred to as a &quot;[[w:pedal tone|pedal tone]]&quot;. The lower note [[wikipedia:drone#in music|drones]] or stays the same and the upper note moves, creating both simple harmonic and melodic motion. Traditional instruments which have fewer strings and a smaller range than the guitar use this technique. It can be heard in many musical styles in both Eastern and Western musical traditions including those with guitar.

This technique can be found both within Western tuning systems which use 12 semitones per octave as well as beyond in more complex Eastern tuning systems. Therefore before attempting to improvise a solo over a chord progression or a series of chords in a particular key, it is useful to practice playing simple melodies on one (upper) string to familiarize your ear with the '''intervals''', or distances between those fretted notes and a static open, un-fretted (lower) string below it which is sounding simultaneously. Another advantage of this is that with each pair of notes you play, different intervals are sounded. Your ear begins to detect these and this is a basic form of ear training.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Parts of an Essay''' — Traditionally, it has been taught that a formal essay consists of three parts: the introductory paragraph or introduction, the body paragraphs, and the concluding paragraph. An essay does not need to be this simple, but it is a good starting point.


The '''introductory paragraph''' accomplishes three purposes: it captures the reader’s interest, it suggests the importance of the essay’s topic, and it ends with a thesis sentence. Often, the thesis sentence states a claim that consists of two or more related points. For example, a thesis might read:
:''A college essay has an introductory paragraph, several body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph.''
You are telling the reader what you think are the most important points which need to be addressed in your essay. For this reason, you need to relate the introduction directly to the question or topic. A strong thesis is essential to a good essay, as each paragraph of your essay should be related back to your thesis or else deleted. Thus, the thesis establishes the key foundation for your essay. A strong thesis not only states an idea, but also uses solid examples to back it up. A weak thesis might be:
:''Wikipedia is a powerful resource in many ways.''
As an alternative, a strong thesis for the same topic would be:
:''Wikipedia is a powerful resource because it allows users with knowledge in a specific area to share their knowledge, because it allows users to quickly find information about a vast array of topics, and because studies have confirmed that it is as accurate as any other encyclopedia.''
Then, you could separate your body paragraphs into three sections: one explaining the open-source nature of the project, one explaining the variety and depth of information, and a final one using studies to confirm that Wikipedia is indeed as accurate as other encyclopedias.

===Tips===
Often, writing an introductory paragraph is the most difficult part of writing an essay. Facing a blank page can be daunting. Here are some suggestions for getting started. First, determine the context in which you want to place your topic. In other words, identify an overarching category in which you would place your topic, and then introduce your topic as a case-in-point.

For example, if you are writing about dogs, you may begin by speaking about friends, dogs being an example of a very good friend. Alternatively, you can begin with a sentence on selective breeding, dogs being an example of extensive selective breeding. You can also begin with a sentence on means of protection, dogs being an example of a good way to stay safe. The context is the starting point for your introductory paragraph. The topic or thesis sentence is the ending point. Once the starting point and ending point are determined, it will be much easier to connect these points with the narrative of the opening paragraph.

A good thesis statement, for example, if you are writing about dogs being very good friends, you could put:
:''A dog is an example of a very good friend because X, Y, and Z.''
Here, X, Y, and Z would be the topics explained in your body paragraphs. In the format of one such instance, X would be the topic of the second paragraph, Y would be the topic of the third paragraph, and Z would be the topic of the fourth paragraph, followed by a conclusion, in which you would summarize the thesis statement.

===Example===
:''As we travel through our lives, we will identify many people as friends. In truth, most of these individuals are simply acquaintances. They will enter and depart from our existences as matters of mutual convenience. True friends will be there for you always. There is no friend truer than a dog.''

Identifying a context can help shape the topic or thesis. Here, the writer decided to write about dogs. Then, the writer selected ''friends'' as the context, dogs being good examples of friends. This shaped the topic and narrowed the focus to ''dogs as friends''. This would make writing the remainder of the essay much easier because it allows the writer to focus on aspects of dogs that make them good friends.

==Body Paragraphs==
Each '''body paragraph''' begins with a topic sentence. If the thesis contains multiple points or assertions, each body paragraph should support or justify them, preferably in the order the assertions originally stated in the thesis. Thus, the topic sentence for the first body paragraph will refer to the first point in the thesis sentence and the topic sentence for the second body paragraph will refer to the second point in the thesis sentence. Generally, if the thesis sentence contains three related points, there should be three body paragraphs, though you should base the number of paragraphs on the number of supporting points needed.

If the core topic of the essay is the format of college essays, the thesis sentence might read:
:''A college essay has an introductory paragraph, several body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph.''
The topic sentence for the first body paragraph might read:
:''The first paragraph of an essay is the introductory paragraph.''
Sequentially, the topic sentence for the second body paragraph might read:
:''The introductory paragraph is followed by several body paragraphs.''
And the topic sentence for the third body paragraph might read:
:''The college essay’s final paragraph is its concluding paragraph.''
Every body paragraphs uses specific details, such as anecdotes, comparisons and contrasts, definitions, examples, expert opinions, explanations, facts, and statistics to support and develop the claim that its topic sentence makes.

===Tips===
When writing an essay for a class assignment, make sure to follow your teacher or professor’s suggestions. Most teachers will reward creativity and thoughtful organization over dogmatic adherence to a prescribed structure. Many will not. If you are not sure how your teacher will respond to a specific structure, ask.

Organizing your essay around the thesis sentence should begin with arranging the supporting elements to justify the assertion put forth in the thesis sentence. Not all thesis sentences will, or should, lay out each of the points you will cover in your essay. In the example introductory paragraph on dogs, the thesis sentence reads, “There is no friend truer than a dog.” Here, it is the task of the body paragraphs to justify or prove the truth of this assertion, as the writer did not specify what points they would cover. The writer may next ask what characteristics dogs have that make them true friends. Each characteristic may be the topic of a body paragraph. Loyalty, companionship, protection, and assistance are all terms that the writer could apply to dogs as friends. Note that if the writer puts dogs in a different context, for example, working dogs, the thesis might be different, and they would be focusing on other aspects of dogs.

It is often effective to end a body paragraph with a sentence that rationalizes its presence in the essay. Ending a body paragraph without some sense of closure may cause the thought to sound incomplete.

Each body paragraph is something like a miniature essay in that they each need an introductory sentence that sounds important and interesting, and that they each need a good closing sentence in order to produce a smooth transition between one point and the next. Body paragraphs can be long or short. It depends on the idea you want to develop in your paragraph. Depending on the specific style of the essay, you may be able use very short paragraphs to signal a change of subject or to explain how the rest of the essay is organized.

Do not spend too long on any one point. Providing extensive background may interest some readers, but others would find it tiresome. Keep in mind that the main importance of an essay is to provide basic background on a subject and, hopefully, to spark enough interest to induce further reading.

===Example===
:''A true friend will be there for you whenever you need them. Any dog owner will say that there is nobody that will stick with you through thick and thin as much as a dog. My own dog can barely contain her joy when I come home from a hard day. Regardless of my mood, and my attitude towards her, she is always happy when I am home, and that is usually enough to make me feel better about everything.''

:''True friends will help you when you are in need. Whether it is to protect their owner against some sort of threat or to help a blind person walk across the street, dogs are the most reliable companion a person could have. Few villains would attack a person walking a dog at night, and statistics show that homes with dogs are among the least likely to be broken into.''
The above example is a bit free-flowing and the writer intended it to be persuasive. The second paragraph combines various attributes of dogs including protection and companionship. Here is when doing a little research can also help. Imagine how much more effective the last statement would be if the writer cited some specific statistics and backed them up with a reliable reference.

==Concluding Paragraph==
The '''concluding paragraph''' usually restates the thesis and leaves the reader something about the topic to think about. If appropriate, it may also issue a call to act, inviting the reader to take a specific course of action with regard to the points that the essay presented.

Aristotle suggested that speakers and, by extension, writers should tell their audience what they are going to say, say it, and then tell them what they have said. The three-part essay model, consisting of an introductory paragraph, several body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph, follows this strategy.

===Tips===
As with all writing, it is important to know your audience. All writing is persuasive, and if you write with your audience in mind, it will make your argument much more persuasive to that particular audience. When writing for a class assignment, the audience is your teacher. Depending on the assignment, the point of the essay may have nothing to do with the assigned topic. In most class assignments, the purpose is to persuade your teacher that you have a good grasp of grammar and spelling, that you can organize your thoughts in a comprehensive manner, and, perhaps, that you are capable of following instructions and adhering to some dogmatic formula the teacher regards as an essay. It is much easier to persuade your teacher that you have these capabilities if you can make your essay interesting to read at the same time. Place yourself in your teacher’s position and try to imagine reading one formulaic essay after another. If you want yours to stand out, capture your teacher’s attention and make your essay interesting, funny, or compelling.

===Example===
:''It is no accident that many people consider their dogs as part of their family. Just like every other member, dogs contribute to the happiness and well-being of the home, making the burdens of caring for them well worth the effort. Dogs deserve love and respect every bit as much as they love and respect us. After all, what more can a friend be?''
In the above example, focus shifted slightly and talked about dogs as members of the family. Many would suggest it departs from the logical organization of the rest of the essay, and some teachers may consider it unrelated and take points away. However, contrary to the common wisdom of “tell them what you are going to say, say it, and then tell them what you have said,” you may find it more interesting and persuasive to shift away from it as the writer did here, and then in the end, return to the core point of the essay. This gives additional effect to what an audience would otherwise consider a very boring conclusion.

'''Panch Puran''' (also called '''Panch Phoran''', '''Panch Phoron''', or '''Bengali Five-Spice Mix''') is a spice mixture used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]]. It is made of equal parts of five spices:

*[[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek seed]] (''methi'')
*[[Cookbook:Nigella|nigella seed]] (''kalo jira'')
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seed]] (''rai'' or ''shorshe'')
*[[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel seed]] (''mouri'')
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seed]] (''jeera'') 

In some variations, wild [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] is used in place of cumin.  In other variations, radhuni seed is added to the mixture.

The name simply means &quot;five spices&quot; in Bengali.

In Bengali cuisine, the seeds are usually fried in [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (or [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]), which causes them to start crackling immediately. [[Cookbook:Vegetable|Vegetables]] (especially [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]), [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]], or [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] are then added.  It is not used with [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]].

el objetivo aunque absurdo era de colocar lo que se pudiera en ejercicios en un pagina asi este ayudaba a la nota final y tratar de pasar la nota, el profesor que un total mediocre para explicar no tenia ni idea de nada 

espero les sea de alguna ayuda ya que para mi no fue por que igual perdi la materia por 2 vez::

== Problemas de razón de cambio ==


1) se suleta un globo en un punto a 150 pies de un observador, quien se encuentra al nivel del piso. si el globo se eleva en línea recta hacia arriba a una velocidad de 8 pies por segundo,¿ qué tan rápido esta aumentando la distancia del observador al globo  cuando el globo esta a 50 pies de altura?(supongase que el globo se suleta desde el nivel del piso)

solución
sea t el número de segundos contados a partir de que se suelta el globo. sea h la altura del globo y s su distancia al observador. tanto h como s son variables  que dependen de t; sin embargo, permanece sin cambio conforme t aumenta. 
obsevemos que al inicio, s casi no cambia (ds/dt=0), pero eventualmente s cambia casi tan rapido como cambia h (ds/dt=dh/dt=8). Una Estimaciónde ds/dt cuando h=50 podría ser alrededor de un tercio o e un medio de dh/dt, o 3. si obtenemos una respuest alejada de este valor, sabremos que hemos cometido un error. Por ejemplo, respuesta tales como 17 o aun 7, obviamente son incorrectas.

Para enfatizar, respondemos tres preguntas fundamentales

(a) ¿Qué esta dado?RESPUESTA dh/dt=8
(b) ¿Qué queremos conocer?RESPUESTA: queremos conocer ds/dt en el instante en que h=50
(c) ¿Como estan relacionadas s y h?
las variables s y h cambian con el tiempo, pero siempre estan relacionadas por medio de la ecuación pitragórica

Los puntos a y b estan en las orillas de un rio recto de 3 km de ancho y son opuestos uno del otro. El punto C esta en la misma orilla que b pero a &quot;K&quot; kilometros de &quot;B&quot; rio abaj. Una compaia telefonica desea tender un cable de &quot;A&quot; y &quot;C&quot; donde costo por kilometro de cable en tierra es de $10000 y el de cable subacuatico es de $ 12500.Sea p un punto en la misma orilla que B y C de modo que el cable se tienda de &quot;A&quot; a &quot;P y luego a C.

a-) SI x kilometros es la distancia de B a P, obtenga una ecuacion que defina a C(x) si C(x) dolares es el costo total del cable tendido y establezca el dominio de c.


respuesta 

 La distancia de P a C es de (K-X9 kilometros y del teorema de pitagoras de a a p es &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[2]{3^2 + x^2} &lt;/math&gt;kilometros. por lo tanto 

&lt;math&gt;c(x) = 12500 \sqrt[2]{3^2 + x^2}+10000(k-x)&lt;/math&gt;
El dominio de C es [0, k]

Un fabricante de cajas de carton quiere elaborar cajas abiertas a partir de trozos rectangulares de carton con dimensiones de 10 pulg por 17 pulg, cortando cuadrados en las esquinas y doblando los lados hacia arriba. Se desea determinar la longitud del lado de los cuadrados que se deben cortar de modo que la caja tenga el mayor volumen posible.

&lt;math&gt;v(x) = 170x-54x^2+4x^3&lt;/math&gt;


y el dominio de v es el intervalo cerrado [0.5] Como v es continua en [0.5]se sabe que el valor v tiene un valor maximo absoluto el cual ocurre en un numero critico o en un extremo del intervalo. para obtener los numeros criticos se calcula v'(x) = 0 o no existe 


V'(x) = 170-108x+12^2

V'(x) existe para todos los valores de x. Al igualar V'(x) a cero y despejar x se tiene 


2(6x^2-54x+85)=0


&lt;math&gt;v(x) =\frac{54+\sqrt[2]{(-54)^2-4(6)(85)}}{12}&lt;/math&gt;
De donde se obtiene x=6.27 y x=2.03.De modo que el unico valor critico de V en [0.5] es 2.03 como v(0)=0 y v(5)=0, mientras que V(2.03)=156.03, el valor absoluto de V ocurre cuando x=2.03



Conclusion El mayor volumen posible es 156.03 pulga^3 y se obtiene cuando la longitud sw loa lados de los cuadrados que se cortaran es de 2.03 pulg.

Una escalera de 25 pie de longitud esta apoyada contra la pared vertical. La base de la escalera se jala horizontalmente alejandola de la pared a 3 pie/s. Suponga que se desea determinar que tan rapido se desliza hacia abajo la parte superior de la escalera sobre la pared cuando su base se encuentra a 15 pies de la pared.

I: El numero de segundos del tiempo que ha transcurrido desde que la escalera comenzo a deslizarse hacia abajo sobre la pared .

X: El numero de pies de la distancia desde la base de la escalera a la pared a los 't' segundos

Y:El numero de pies de la distancia desde el piso a la parte superior de la escalera a los t segundos 



Como la base de la escalera es jalada horizontalmente alejandola de la pared a 3/pies &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=3&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Se desea determinar&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}cuando  x=15&lt;/math&gt; 

Escriba una ecuacion que relacione a 'X','Y' y del teorema de pitagoras 

y^2=625-x^2


Se deriva con respecto a t 

&lt;math&gt;2y\frac{dx}{dt}=-2x\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac-{x}{y}.\frac-{dx}{dy}&lt;/math&gt;


sustituya los valores conocidos de x,y y y &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
en la ecuacion anterior para &lt;math&gt;2y\frac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Cuando x=15 de (1) y= 20 . como &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=3&lt;/math&gt;
se obtiene de (2) 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}= \frac -{15}{20}.3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac-{9}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

el signo indica que decrece conforme t aumenta

Cierta cantidad de agua fluye a una tasa de 2m^3 hacia el interior de un deposito cuya forma es la de un cono invertido de 16 m de altura y 4 m de radio ¿que tab rapido sube el nivel del agua cuando esta ha alcanzado 5 m de profundidad?

t:El numero de minutos del tiempo que ha trascurrido desde que el agua comenzo a fluir dentro del tanque

h:El numero de metros de altura del nivel del agua a los t minutos 

r:el numero de metros del radio de la superficie del agua a los t minutos 

v:el numero de metros cubicos del volumen de agua en el tanque a los t minutos. observe que v , r y h son funciones de t


puesto que el agua fluye dentro del tanque a una tasa de 2 m^3/min 

entonces
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=2&lt;/math&gt;
 se desea determinar &lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt} cuando h = 5&lt;/math&gt;

en cualquier tiempo el volumen del agua en el tanque puede expresarse como el volumen de un cono

&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{1}{3}pi*r^2h&lt;/math&gt;

Se conoce &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;y se desea determinar &lt;/math&gt;\frac{dh}{dy} por lo tanto se nesesita una ecuacion que involucre a V y h. Asi primero se expresa r en terminos de h.

&lt;math&gt;\frac {r}{h}pi(\frac{4}{16})^2(h)=v=\frac{1}{48}pih^3&lt;/math&gt;

Al diferenciar los dos miembros de esta ecuacion con respecto a t 
&lt;math&gt;\frac {dv}{dt}=\frac{1}{16}pih^2(h).\frac{dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

ahora se sustituye 2 por &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}\frac{dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;y se resuelve la ecuacion para 


&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{32}{pih^2}&lt;/math&gt;


asi,


&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{32}{25pi}&lt;/math&gt;

al convertir metros a centimetros se tiene=0.4074 m/min=40.74 cm/min.

El nivel del agua sube a una tasa de 40.74 cm/min cuando el agua ha alcanza una profundidad de 5 m.

Dos automoviles, uno va hacia el este a una tas a de 90 km/h, y el otro hacia el sur a 60 km/h, se dirigen hacia la interseccion de os carreteras. ¿a que tasa se estan aproximando uno al otro en el instante en que el primer automovil esta 0.2 km de la interseccion y el segundo se encuentra a 0.15 km de dicha interseccion?

t: el numero de horas del tiempo que ha trascurrido desde que los automoviles empezaron a aproximarse a p.

x:el numero de kilometros de la distancia a partir del primer automovil a p a las t horas

y:el numero de kilometros de la distancia a partir del segundo automovil a p a las t horas

z:el numero de kilometros de la distancia entre los dos automoviles a la t horas


Como el primer carro se acerca a p a una tasa de variacion de - km/h90 y x esta decreciendo conforme t crece, entonces &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=-90&lt;/math&gt; de la misma manera &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=-60&lt;/math&gt;

Se desea determinar &lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; cuando x=0.2 y y=0.15

Del teorema de pitagoras 

&lt;math&gt;z^2=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;


al diferenciar los dos miembros de (4) con respecto a t, se obtiene 
&lt;math&gt;2z\frac {dz}{dt}=2x\frac{dx}{dt}+2y\frac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {dz}{dt}=\frac{x\frac{dx}{dt}+y\frac{dy}{dt}}{z}&lt;/math&gt;

Cuando x=0.2 y y=0.15 de (4) se tiene que z=0.25 en (5) se sustituyen&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} por -90&lt;/math&gt;{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; por -60, x por 0.2 y por 0.15 y z por 0.25 para obtener

Suponga que en cierto mercado, x miles de canastillas se surten diariamente cuando p dolares es el precio por la canastilla. La ecuacion de oferta es

Si el suministro diario decrece a una tasa de 250 canastillas por dia,¿a que tasa esta variando el precio cuando la oferta diaria la oferta diaria es de 5000 canastillas?


Sea t dias el tiempo que ha transcurrido desde que el simnistro diario empezo a decrecer 
 la variable p y x estan definidas como funciones de t en el enunciado del problema .
debido a que el suministro diario esta decreciendo a una tasa de cambio de 250 
canastillas por dia,entonces &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=-\frac{250}{1000}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy}=-\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
Se desea determinar &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; Cuando x=5 De la ecuacion de oferta dada, al diferenciar implicitamente con respecto a t se obtiene

&lt;math&gt;p\frac{dx}{dt}+x\frac{dp}{dt}-3\frac{dx}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{3-p}{x-20}.\frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Cuando x=5, se deduce de la ecuacion de oferta que p=6

Debido a que &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac-{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; Se tiene la ecuacion anterior 

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3-6}{5-20}*\frac{-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

This technique is also known as 'blooming '.

Though instant yeasts are now available which can be mixed directly with the dry ingredients in a recipe, many people find that this technique still improves the quality and rising times of bread. Proofing is also the easiest way to determine if an old packet of yeast is still viable. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 cup of warm water or other liquid reserved from the bread recipe
* 1 teaspoon of sugar
* 1 tablespoon of yeast, or as called for in the recipe
* 1/4 teaspoon of ginger

== Procedure ==
#Make sure the water is warm and between 112 and 120°F (44 - 49°C). Hot water (above 49C/120F) could kill the yeast, and water above 60C/140F definitely will. Cold water will significantly slow yeast growth. A general guideline is to stick your finger into the water; if you find it warm and comfortable, so will the yeast.
#Thoroughly stir the ingredients into the water, making sure everything dissolves properly (yeast, in some forms, is rather prone to forming clumps at the bottom). Let this mixture sit in a warm place until there is a bubbly froth on top. Depending on the type of yeast, this will take between 10 and 30 minutes, and should yield a &quot;head&quot; of at least one centimeter. Use as indicated in your recipe. If no bubbles develop, discard and obtain new yeast.

== Yeast Cake Substitution ==
Many older cookbooks will often have recipes calling for a &quot;yeast cake&quot;. This is a small cake of active yeast, often 0.6 ounces (17 grams) in weight. They are not normally used today since they are highly perishable and have a short shelf life, even when refrigerated (about 10 days). 1 Yeast Cake can be substituted with 1 packet or 2 1/4 teaspoons of Active Dry Yeast. To substitute a 2 ounce yeast cake, use 3 packets or 6 3/4 teaspoons of Active Dry Yeast.

===Someone's god allegedly said...===
[[File:Brahma_on_hamsa.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brahmā, the Hindu creator, with his characteristic four heads, in simple/false perspective.)]]
'''&quot;Let there be light!&quot;''' Most philosophies, religious or otherwise, presuppose some sort of creation myth. For scientists it's a big bang, for monotheists the big guy upstairs, and for other traditions it can be giant animals or god-like beings who thrashed the earth or oceans in to being in a fit of anger, love, fun, or some such verb of probably far from random selection. In any case, when creating art, we are creating a finite world: that is, one with edges. Artists usually call this the 'frame', but in fact some of them decided to make a point of using jars full of poo instead,&lt;ref&gt;That was the Dadaists.&lt;/ref&gt; so the frame became transparent ... which requires transparent things like glass, which are lenses and haven't been invented yet, so perhaps we're getting ahead of ourselves and shouldn't get so technical!

The point here is that in creating something as the output of our photographic process, we are in fact somewhat like these divine beings: ''verb''-ing in to existence a finite milieu.&lt;ref&gt;That means 'world' in French, a fact which is primarily useful to pretend everyone else knows at parties.&lt;/ref&gt; As photographers ''shooting'' (and therefore as artists ''making'') we take on those god-like qualities of creating and destroying worlds at our very whim. Some creation myths begin with a '''pure white''' brightness (&quot;let there be light!&quot;), others the '''bottomless black''' of an empty universe. Still others have '''complex and fleeting tonalities''', like the churning of an ocean of milk. As photographers, we are concerned with all three of these as our raw material for creation.

===Raw vision===
'''From an evolutionary standpoint''', let us suggest for a moment that in the beginning there were eyes. Not just floating in the void, mind you, but attached to bodies. If an eye - and, dragging it along kicking and screaming, the body it remained attached to - stayed still for a few moments, then sometimes things would move. Noticing this was beneficial to certain kinds of creatures, such as our own ancestors, as they could use this information to avoid predators (big scary sabre-toothed tigers) or to find food (colorful fruit falling from trees, for instance). Our brains, the most sophisticated by many measures on the earth today, spent millions of years evolving extremely well to efficiently process sophisticated images to detect both movement and objects of interest within a still frame. Back in those days, imagery was all about danger, food, and other serious business: the stuff of life that keeps you standing ... or gets you eaten. As it happens, our ancestors were particularly adept at using these powers, and eventually the sophisticated imagery of complex human vision emerged from the primordial soup. Incidentally, when we are born, scientists now know that our brains only see random sensory input, they don't have a presupposition that these-nerve-endings-over-here are to do with vision, and those-nerve-endings-over-there are to do with touch. It's all just random input, and in fact in recent years multiple adults have re-trained their brains to receive balance or sight from their tongues.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Brain That Changes Itself'', a great book on these recent developments in science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primordial aesthetics===
[[File:Caveman_5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Our ancestors enjoying warmth, light, food and safety. Good times.]]
'''Though there was probably very little art''' in those early times, our aesthetic senses had long since begun to evolve from innate responses to natural stimuli such as commanding views (safety), darkness (danger), light (warmth), and so on. These associations would carry forward in to art as we began to discover ways to record our perceptions of the world: in physical art such as cave paintings, through our sophisticated and relatively unique command of language, and through social modes of communication such as dance and ritual.

===Sitting still and going far===
'''Still later''', yet far before cameras appeared, humans used these powers of observation to realise fundamental principles of light. They knew, for example, that observation of the movement of shadows cast by standing objects over time could be reliably predicted and even associated with the time of day: if you stood at the end of the valley when the shadows had grown long, then you had better run back to the cave or face the evening hunt of the local tigers! This led, as humans began slowly to ponder such mysteries to good effect, to various sorts of technological innovations: chiefly calendrical and architectural, but also mathematic, for the line of a shadow is pure and its relationship to the source intrinsic.

===Imperfect representation===
'''When copying something''', or the image of something, it's usually impossible to do so accurately. This is true fundamentally for the process of depicting our three-dimensional world (four if you count time!) on any two dimensional artwork: including approximately two dimensional cave walls, modern photographs, and early pictures. There are many reasons for this, but perspective an important factor: our brains cannot perceive depth and therefore anything approaching realism on a flat piece of paper unless given other clues. The first such clue was size, or perspective.

[[File:Lascaux 04.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Grotte Chauvet'' prehistoric cave art.]]
The Grotte Chauvet cave in France includes some of the world's earliest known cave painting, estimated at about 32,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian aboriginal people, whose culture still exists, have paintings made 60,000 and 40,000 years ago.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether these paintings specifically included the device of relative scale, however much of the global body of neolithic art did, ie. the artists sized objects and characters hierarchically according to their spiritual or thematic importance, not their distance from the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Stated differently, they did not use foreshortening.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be argued that theirs was a symbolic perspective, rather than a physical one.

[[File:Ägyptischer Maler um 1360 v. Chr. 002.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Overlapping illustrates depth. Amarna period of ancient Egypt, 1375-1358 BC]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Guardians_of_Day_and_Night,_Han_Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Overlapping illustrates depth. Chinese Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) tomb paintings.]] --&gt;
The second such clue was overlapping to suggest relative depth. This was certainly well in use by around the beginning of the common era, with global examples plentiful, for instance in early ancient Egyptian art and Chinese Han Dynasty tombs.

[[File:Pine Trees.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tones illustrate depth. 16th century Japanese painting of pine trees in the 5th century Chinese 'mountain and water painting' tradition.]]
[[File:Cai-lun.jpg|thumb|right|300px|18th century print of Cai Lun, the Chinese progenitor of uniform, industrial scale paper making.]]
The third such clue was tone. It took humans a great deal of time to comprehend fully the expressiveness of tone for the illusion of depth. Given the relative tonal limitations of naturally occurring rock outcrops and other early media such as pottery, it is perhaps not surprising to realise that the exploration of tone perhaps naturally almost co-incided with the development of that most powerful of mediums: paper! Paper appeared in China at least as early as the early second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Physical fragments dated 179-41 BC have been recovered.&lt;/ref&gt; According to textual evidence, by the fifth century some of the earliest artwork exploring tones - the layered ink work of the Chinese 山水画 or &quot;mountain and water painting&quot; - had already developed to prominence.

Probably at the same time as the above developments, investigation in to visual perspective began, for instance around the fifth century BC in Greece where the philosophers Anaxagoras and Democritus worked out geometric theories of perspective. Euclid's ''Optics'', a mathematical treatment of perspective, soon followed in around 300 BC.

===Then man said...===
[[File:Nimrud lens British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Nimrud or Leyard lens, 8th century BC.]]
'''&quot;Let there be lenses!&quot;''' Eventually, a distant ancestor of ours had the bright&lt;ref&gt;No pun intended.&lt;/ref&gt; idea of ending all this enjoyable evolutionary fun by discovering naturally occurring crystals that were capable of acting as lenses. Modern evidence of ancient lenses is partial, with some direct finds and some extremely fine workmanship that is held as evidence of lens-work.

[[File:Roman_-_Intaglio_of_a_Circus_with_a_Chariot_Race_-_Walters_421314.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Second century Roman jasper carving (1.5×1.1cm)]]
In the former category, as recently as the last few years, concepts of ancient navigation in the north Atlantic are being reevaluated following the discovery of formerly near-mythical convex-lens sunstones made from a transparent calcite crystal known as 'Iceland spar' that allowed sailors to determine the direction of the sun even on very cloudy days, and after nightfall in northern latitudes. While the 16th century shipwreck it was found on is fairly late, it is thought to have been an established device by this era, having been referenced in 12th century literature as existing at least as early as the 10th century. The story is compounded by the Visby lenses, a collection of lens-shaped manufactured objects made of rock crystal (quartz) found in several Viking graves on the island of Gotland, Sweden, and dating from the 11th or 12th century. But that's nothing! An 1858 excavation at Niniveh in Babylon also unearthed an ancient Assyrian lens, now known as the Nimrud lens or Layard lens, dating from 750–710 BC, now held in the British Museum and thought to be the oldest in the world.

[[File:Silfurberg.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Iceland spar, one of the minerals first used as a lens.]]
In the latter category, extremely fine workmanship of a kind considered unattainable with the naked eye (less than 0.1mm) qualifies a 1.3mm wide ivory carving from Abydos, Egypt, recently discovered by German archaeologist Gunter Dreyer that dates from 3300 BC. Other later but still early objects such as the Isopata gold ring from Crete, dated 15th century BC and with workmanship below 0.5mm and approaching 0.1mm and a jasper carving from second century Rome with 0.1-0.2mm details challenge alternate explanation.

Later, a friendly Italian fellow known as Giambattista Della Porta said '''let there be lenses on cameras!''' .. or words roughly to that effect. (He was in fact a failed dramatist with a flair for science, blessed with proximity to Venice, a major contemporary center of glass work, who also produced written works on ''refraction'' - the bending of light that is the primary science behind basic lens design.)

===The coming of the ''Camera obscura''===
[[File:Camera_obscura2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Camera obscura'', illustration from ''Sketchbook on military art, including geometry, fortifications, artillery, mechanics, and pyrotechnics'', 17th century, possibly Italian.]]

The lensless camera, or ''camera obscura'' is essentially an opaque box or room with a hole in it. The first surviving mention of some of the principles behind the pinhole camera or camera obscura belongs to 墨子 (''Mozi''; 470-390 BCE), a Chinese philosopher and the founder of ''Mohism''. Mozi correctly asserted that the image in a camera obscura is flipped upside down because light travels in straight lines from its source. His disciples developed this into a minor theory of optics.

In the western world, the camera has been in use in principle since the Renaissance. It was known as the ''camera obscura'', Latin for 'dark chamber', and consisted of a darkened room with a pinhole in the wall facing the subject, which would be outside the room. An inverted image would fall on the opposite wall, which would then be traced manually.

== Cameras ==

=== What is a camera? ===
At its most basic, a camera is a system for projecting light onto a surface, typically but ''not exclusively'' for the purposes of recording the image. This broadest definition includes microsocopes, ''camera obscura'', digital cameras, video cameras (previously known as cine cameras), cell phone cameras and other such devices that are related to conventional cameras but do not necessarily include all of the same features.

Various dictionaries offer a surprising variety of generic but dated definititions for 'camera', most of which predate digital cameras and exclude both lensless devices (pinhole/''camera obscura'') and video cameras. Here are some examples:
*'''Collins English Dictionary''' (United Kingdom; 2012): ''an optical device consisting of a lens system set in a light-proof construction inside which a light-sensitive film or plate can be positioned''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/camera camera]''. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 2012 Digital Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Macquarie Dictionary''' (Australia; 2014): ''a photographic apparatus in which a sensitive plate or film is exposed, the image being formed by means of a lens.''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/features/word/search/?word=camera&amp;search_word_type=Dictionary camera]''. Macquarie Dictionary, Macmillan Publishers Group Australia, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Merriam-Webster''' (United States; 2016): ''a device that consists of a lightproof chamber with an aperture fitted with a lens and a shutter through which the image of an object is projected onto a surface for recording (as on film) or for translation into electrical impulses (as for television broadcast)''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/camera camera]''. Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three basic components of a camera are:
*A '''directional light source''', which, generally having bounced off the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Or around the subject, if recording a silhouette!&lt;/ref&gt; can be said to contain an image of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;We should really note that there are different types of light, which have different properties, and different recording devices have differing and unequal degrees of sensitivity to these various wavelengths of the continuous spectrum of light waves, however to keep things simple we'll save this pedantry for a footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''device to record or display the image''', which is generally either traditional film or a digital sensor, but can also be various alternative forms of chemical recording surface, glass plates, or similar flat surfaces with the objective of recording or displaying an image.
*A '''shutter''' or alternative means of beginning and ending the exposure of the recording device to the light-containing image

In general, the light that contains the image has to be segregated from (or in some cases, merely much stronger than) any other light present, or the image will not form (too much light will result in a purely white image, or 'overexposure'). To aid in the control of light, which is the primary process in photography, cameras are therefore generally designed as closed boxes that do not permit light from entering except from one direction, that of the subject. Such a design allows the camera to be pointed towards a subject, and during the exposure only light from that subject (ie. that which contains an image of the subject) will flow in to the camera, thus resulting in a clean image.&lt;ref&gt;In former times, it was possible to accidentally double-expose images (typically by forgetting to 'wind on' the film after a photograph), thus combining images of multiple subjects in to a single image for artistic purposes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some examples of cameras===
Let's look at some examples.
*In the case of a 'pinhole camera', one of the simplest types of cameras that it is possible to make, the direction of the image is controlled simply by punching a small hole in the camera box which functions to project an inverted image of the subject on to the surface (eg. recording device) inside. 
*In so-called 'sun printing', the sun is used as a light source and neither a hole nor a lens is used, indeed the camera does not even exist! Instead, items are placed across the recording device (most frequently using a cheap, outdated chemical process like ''cyanotype'') to result in their outlines being recorded.
*In the case of the 'view camera' category, which evolved from the 19th century and is still used today, the image is generally captured through a lens (though pinholes can be used), and various types of exposure control are available.
*In the case of a mobile phone, a lens is typically fixed in to the device by the manufacturer and emphasis is placed on obtaining maximum utility in a broad range of common personal photographic scenarios, automatic operation, a user-friendly interface, and ease of sharing.
*In the case of a modern SLR (single lens reflex) or DSLR (digital SLR) camera, the image is almost always a captured through a glass lens, using a precise shutter to control the length of exposure.

Today, when we discuss cameras we are almost always discussing modern cameras, those incorporating an opaque camera body, precise shutter speed and aperture control, and a proper lens.&lt;ref&gt;Even plastic lenses in toy cameras, cheap webcams or mobile phones are superior to lens-less pinhole cameras in terms of the focus and overall quality they can produce.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camera Controls ===
====Four basic controls====
As the purpose of a camera is to project light onto a surface that will record an image, most cameras have the same basic controls and these controls affect how the image is recorded. The three basic controls are: 

* '''Location and orientation of the camera''': The most basic variables you can alter, and perhaps the most important. While distance from some subjects may sometimes be an asset (wildlife, covert photography, capturing natural expressions during event photography), often getting in close to a human social distance offers the most engaging angles. Similarly, shots from far above or below can lend incredibly different feelings to the subject, and suggest different reactions to the viewer. Generally, shots from far above may inspire feelings of safety or distance from the subject, encouraging the subject to be considered in a more distant or philosophical mindset by the viewer. Shots from below may make the subject appear large and dominating, exaggerating its presence.
* '''Shutter speed''' (&quot;how long the image is exposed for&quot;): The amount of time that light will be allowed to pass through the lens during the exposure (ie. between the beginning and the end of the photograph). The longer the shutter is open, the brighter an image will become, however the image will also be more sensitive to motion blur as a result of movement in the camera or the subject it is capturing. Sports or action photography therefore depends upon fast shutter speeds (ie. shorter exposures), whereas careful and slow photography of relatively dark or still subjects (mountains, stars in the sky, etc.) generally depends upon slower shutter speeds. 
* '''Aperture''' (&quot;how big the hole is&quot;): The size of the (usually roughly circular) opening behind the lens. A larger aperture (or opening) will allow more light to pass through the lens than a smaller one. A larger opening will create a brighter image. Apertures are measured in 'f-stops', which are written {{f/}}''number''. Note that these numbers are 'backwards': somewhat confusingly, smaller numbers (such as {{f/}}0.95) mean bigger openings and/or more light entering the camera, whereas larger numbers (such as {{f/}}6.3) mean smaller openings and/or less light entering the camera.&lt;ref&gt;Lenses, which are a swappable component on many cameras, are generally described using their minimum {{f/}} rating (ie. the maximum amount of light which they permit). Lenses with small numbers (such as {{f/}}1.0) are described as ''fast'', whereas lenses with big numbers (such as {{f/}}6.3) are described as ''slow''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sensitivity''' (&quot;how fast the image is recorded&quot;) (often when expressed casually, '''ISO''', which actually refers to the '''ISO 5800 standards documents''' originally published for film speed by the International Organization for Standardization): In any event, the sensitivity of the film or digital sensor to light. In traditional film cameras, you had to swap film to change this factor because it was a property of the type of film being used. In modern digital cameras, the ISO rating describes film-speed equivalency and is almost always possible to change in the camera, either manually or automatically. The scale is arithmetic, which means that a film with a rating of ISO 800, for example, will be eight times more sensitive to light than one of ISO 100. A higher ISO is useful in low light environments, however increasing the ISO will affect the quality of the image: in film the images become grainy, and in digital the image becomes noisier, with more undesirable speckles. Some of these noise articles can be removed after the fact, however, and low light performance is an area in which digital sensors have been making rapid improvements in recent years.

Changing any of the settings will affect how the image looks and will be discussed further later. For now let's briefly examine some additional controls available to photographers, then look at different cameras and where these controls can be found.

====Additional controls====
{{Wikipedia|Tilt-shift photography}}
In addition to the basic controls of shutter speed, aperture and sensitivity, some cameras provide or may be fitted with additional controls, including:
*'''Lens and zoom selection''': Many cameras allow you to change lenses to achieve different optical effects, predominantly related to depth of field, minimum focal distance, what percentage of a scene will be captured within the frame, available light (faster lenses provide mode light) and whether or not zoom is possible to adjust without changing lenses again.
*'''Tilt/shift or lens/image plane alignment'''. Built in to some types of cameras, particularly old analog view cameras, but available as aftermarket lens features even on modern DSLR camera systems, such controls enable the photographer to carefully manage which portions of a subject remain in focus and distort or correct their perspective optically, prior to recording of the image.
*'''Lighting''': Many cameras have built-in or optional 'flash' lighting. In addition, some cameras allow external lights to be connected by wire or wireless. Careful control of the lighting in a scene is most often made in studio photography, such as portraiture, still life and commercial product and advertising photography.
*'''Optical filters''' have long been used by photographers to achieve additional control of their images. There are many types available:
**'''Polarization''' (control of light wave orientation and therefore reduction of overall light entering the camera; these are further divided in to circular and linear polarization filters - the former are more expensive and are designed to allow modern camera metering and auto-focus systems to continue to function normally)
**'''Wavelength''' (for instance infra-red or ultra-violet wavelength filters may block these specific wavelengths, and individual colour filters may for example block blues, reds or greens. There are also warmth filters that enhance or reduce a broad range of colors over a greater breadth of the visible spectrum simultaneously, for example with the objective of countering the unnatural colour effects of certain types of artificial lights such as fluorescent bulbs.)
**'''Neutral density''' (blocking all wavelengths of light equally but only partially, in order to effect slower exposures of the same scene, for example to accentuate motion blur in moving subjects such as running water. These may be complete or graduated, ie. blocking more light on one side of the image than another, often in a clean gradient.)
**'''Blur''', '''softening''' or '''diffusion''' (reducing focus from certain portions of an image, often to create a dream-like effect)
**'''Diopter''', '''close-up''' or '''macro''' (allows a given lens to focus closer to a subject than it is usually capable)
**'''Bokeh''' (apply specific geometric shapes to the brightest portions of the ''bokeh'' - or highly unfocused image regions)
**'''Novelty''' (the classic example are star filters, which alter highly directional lights - also known as point lights - to obtain a cheesy, starry, visual effect; another example are also multivision filters which can provide multiple copies of the subject within the frame. Such filters are generally remnants of the analog era and are now being replaced by software post-processing.)
*'''Compound imaging modes''' are modes in which multiple exposures may be combined in to a single image. There are two main types of compound imaging:
**'''Multiple exposure''' is a classic analog-era technique in which two or more exposures are made to the same piece of film, often resulting in a dream-like tangle of tones or surreal combinations of subjects.
**'''High Dynamic Range''' ('''HDR''') images may be produced in the digital-era by either manual or automated exposure bracketing, a process in which multiple exposures are taken of the same subject with different shutter speeds. These higher and lower exposures are then combined in to a single image, enhancing the effective dynamic range of the image (ie. capturing a broader range of shadow and highlight detail than would otherwise be possible). Some cameras have this feature built-in, others allow the automation of capture but leave the combination of the multiple resulting images to computer-based post-processing.
*'''Digital-only controls'''' are those which are artifacts of the era of digital photography.
**'''Effects''' are pre-built options on digital cameras allowing for certain types of post-processing within the camera itself. While these may be set before taking an image, much like the basic controls, they are in fact generally only applied by the camera in software after the image has already been captured, and thus are not true image-taking controls.
**'''Color depth''' is the amount of information to be stored for each individual pixel (square) of a digital image. It may be expressed in two ways, either:
***For each color-channel (red, green and blue), or 'bits per channel'. This is the standard means of description in the photographic world.
***In terms of the total 'bits per pixel' (combining all colour channels), which is a common means of description in the computer imaging world.
::For example, an 8 bit color depth per channel image would have 24 bits per pixel, a 16 bit color depth per channel image would have 48 bits per pixel, and so on. Modern digital image sensors provide at least 16 or 24 bits per channel, though 8 bits per channel is still adequate quality for many purposes and is very common online.
:*'''Resolution''' is the amount of pixels (square, component points within an image) to store when taking a photograph. Higher resolution generally creates a higher quality image, though poor lenses, motion or subject blur, long exposures or a constrained publishing resolution may all provide good reasons to reduce resolution at the time of capture. Reducing resolution increases camera image storage speed (increasing the number of images per second that may be stored, for example in burst mode photography of action such as sporting events) as well as overall storage space requirements, image transmission times, etc. It is generally expressed in pixels as ''width'' x ''height'', though some cameras provide a simplified set of options based on the conventions &quot;RAW, LARGE, MEDIUM, SMALL&quot; and many support the dual storage of both RAW and processed raster files (usually JPEG) of a selected size.

=== Types of cameras ===
The following terms have been historically used to describe various types of cameras. These terms are not exclusive (for example, you can have a Single lens reflex or twin lens reflex pinhole camera), nor are they necessarily the only terms around. They are included here for reference purposes.
==== By lens type ====
===== Pinhole =====
[[Image:Pinhole-camera.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram showing the operation of a simple, pinhole camera. Due to the lack of a lens, the image is inverted as it is projected in to the camera.]]
The pinhole camera is relatively rare today, but is enjoying a resurgence of casual interest due to its simplicity. It is one of the simplest camera designs possible and has three major components: a light-proof box, a light sensitive material (such as a traditional analog film, or a digital sensor) and opposite the material a hole that light passes through carrying the external image.  There is no lens; the aperture is created by punching a small hole opposite where the film is mounted and is very small; and the 'shutter' in more advanced cameras is emulated manually by uncovering and covering the opening. Despite its simplicity, it still has many enthusiasts because of the unique pictures it creates and the imaginative ways of turning ordinary objects into pinhole cameras.

Analog pinhole cameras are very easy to make from scratch for exposing traditional film: the principle is identical to the pioneering ''camera obscura'' experiment. Typically, a prefabricated, light-sealed container like a biscuit tin or a match-box can be used. Most digital cameras with changeable lenses can be converted in to pinhole cameras by replacing the lens with a sheet of opaque material with a hole punched in it.

Note that a method exists for calculating the optimum pinhole size: too small or too large and the image will lack definition.

==== By focal method ====
Focus is fundamental to photography, a fact that has determined the development of the different broad types of camera. Focus is dependent upon a number of relationships, distance of the subject from the camera being the most important.
 
===== No focus =====
Some cameras do not offer the photographer any means to adjust focus. These cameras would typically be of the following types:
*Very simple (lensless), such as pinhole cameras
*Very early, simple or less sophisticated field or view cameras, from the early development of modern photography
*Non-interchangeable, simple, fixed prime lens special purpose cameras (for example, certain early analog spy cameras or those designed to be operated from aerial balloons)

===== Fully manual focus =====
Many field or view cameras (the sorts of things you see people taking photographs under blankets with in early 20th century or late 19th century movies, and their spiritual successors) provide no automated means for focusing, instead relying on the photographer to manually adjust the focal ring on the lens based upon comparing an estimate distance to numbers marked or engraved there for that purpose. Eventually, separate devices for estimating subject distance became available, known as rangefinders.

===== Rangefinder cameras =====
[[File:Sp-s3w.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the world's most numerous rangefinder cameras, the Nikon SP and S3.]] 
Prior to the widespread development of electronic autofocus systems, the dominant focusing technique of the late 20th century was the analog rangefinder, sometimes shortened to RF. In the most common configuration of such a system, the photographer manually aligns two images within a viewport. Once the images are aligned, the camera is said to be in focus, and a subject distance may be displayed or derived. Earlier and cheaper systems including the initial, portable, off-camera systems required the photographer to manually transfer the resulting distance to the configuration of the focus ring on their camera, which would be marked with various distances in feet or meters. Later systems, such as those still produced by companies such as the German manufacturer Leica Camera AG, couple the results to the focusing mechanism of the camera and are known as coupled rangefinder cameras.

Historically, the major advantages of the rangefinder designs are for certain applications. Since there is no moving mirror, as used in SLRs, there is no momentary blackout of the subject being photographed. The camera is therefore often quieter, particularly with leaf shutters, and usually smaller and less obtrusive. These qualities make rangefinders more attractive for theater photography, some portrait photography, candid and street photography, and any application where an SLR is too large or obtrusive. The absence of a mirror allows the rear element of lenses to project deep into the camera body, making high-quality wide-angle lenses easier to design. However, it is important to note that these advantages are now shared by many types of digital cameras and cellphones, which usually do not require manual focus or exposure: for example, 'silent mode' on the Sony α7R II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/alpha-dog-hands-on-with-sony-a7r-ii?slide=9 Alpha Dog: Hands on with Sony A7R-II]. DPReview.com, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Autofocus (AF) =====
The majority of camera systems today provide some means of electronic autofocus (AF), though there are still other camera types produced. Electronic autofocus systems are very complex and can provide unrivaled support for certain photographic situations, for example:
* Action telephoto photography with occasional intermediate obstructions
* Normally moving subjects such as sports people running or walking
* Highly erratically moving subjects, such as darting animals or insects
Autofocus systems are based upon various technologies, a current example of which is 'phase-difference', presently in use (2016) by high-end Canon DSLRs such as the 50.4 Megapixel Canon 5DS.

==== By method of optical projection ====
===== Twin lens reflex =====
The exact origins of the twin lens reflex (TLR) camera are obscure. Double-lens cameras were around from about 1870, when someone realised that having a second viewing lens alongside the taking lens meant that one could focus without having to keep swapping a ground glass screen for the plate afterwards, reducing the time delay in actually taking the shot. 

Where the TLR came into its own was with the idea of using a reflex mirror to allow viewing from above, thus allowing the camera to be held much more steadily if handheld. The same principle of course applied to the single lens reflex, but early SLRs caused delays and inconvenience through the need to move the mirror out of the focal plane to allow light to the plate behind it.  When this process was automated, the movement of the mirror could cause shake in the camera and blur the shot. 

One of the earliest documented TLRs was made by the firm of R &amp; J Beck of Cornhill, London in 1880 for Mr G M Whipple, a scientist and Superintendent of the Royal Observatory at Kew. It seems the design concept was his - to build a mirror reflex camera for cloud photography. The aim was to have a camera with lenses pointing upwards, but also to be able to compose the picture whilst looking horizontally. It seems this camera also used geared linking to synchronise the lenses, thus having many of the features of later mass-marketed TLRs  .

There were a number of other types of TLR marketed between about 1890 and 1910, but these were gradually overtaken as more effective SLRs became available and cured the problem of parallax which bedevilled the TLR. The ability to see and compose the subject exactly in the taking lens outweighed the disadvantage of the moving mirror as SLR mechanisms improved.

===== Single lens reflex =====
[[File:Canon EOS 500D ohne Gurt 02.jpg|thumb|Canon EOS 500D, a fairly typical digital SLR]]
As already discussed, focus is fundamental to photography, both in terms of what is and what is not in focus.  A rangefinder camera, which allows one to determine the focusing distance, determines what should be in focus, but without actually demonstrating the degree. The TLR (Twin-Lens Reflex camera) goes one step further, by using a second viewing lens.

However, it is the SLR (Single Lens Reflex camera) that solves the problem fully. In this type of camera a mirror intercepts the light that passes through the lens and projects it onto a ground glass screen where it forms an erect (upright) but mirrored image. Now the photographer is truly viewing through the lens and able to accurately determine both the focus and depth of field. When the photograph is ready to be taken the mirror is retracted allowing the light to pass directly to the film, when the shutter is opened. The earliest models required the mirror to be retracted manually (this disappeared with the ''Speed Reflex'' in the mid-1920s), did not have the familiar prism of today, and demanded the viewer to inspect the image through a leather tlunnel to the ground glass screen.  Another common feature of SLRs necessitated by their construction was the need for the light to pass through the lens to the reflex mirror unhindered.  This lead to the ''focal plane shutter'', where the mechanism is placed just in front of the film.

This is  how most people perceive the SLR with the distinctive prism housing on top that first appeared on a Contax camera in 1948. [[File:SLR cross section.svg|thumb|SLR cross section]] The prism serves to reflect and flip the mirrored image from the ground glass screen to the viewfinder, resulting in an erect and true image which is bright and often magnified by the viewfinder optics. The use of 35mm film allows these cameras to be relatively compact which removed one of the SLRs drawbacks. With the shutter positioned just ahead of the film within the camera's body, it is possible to change lenses without exposing the film, making the design very flexible. The principal shortcoming is that the focal plane shutter uses a variable gap to vary the shutter speed and that only a longish exposure time will synchronise with flash.

===== View camera =====
The view camera is of either a monorail design or what is called a flat bed or field camera. The flat bed being an older design and dating back to the middle of the 19th century. In both designs a flexible bellows separates the lens and film. The lens is affixed to a front standard and the film positioned in the rear standard. Both front and rear standards can move horizontally along the rail of a monorail or on tracks in the bed in the case of the flatbed design. In most designs the front and rear standards are equipped to pivot in both the x and y axis independent of each other. These are called &quot;swings&quot; and &quot;tilts&quot;. There is usually some allowance for the rise and fall of both front and rear standards along the vertical plane. All of these movements allows for great flexibility in the control of the image.

== Paragraph Order ==

In the paragraph headed Single Lens Reflex it mentions Rangefinder, then goes on to describe a few aspects of Rangefinder. It seems to me that the paragraph on range finder should come first, with perhaps a little revision. This also gives a more logical progression  from simple (pinhole) to complex (SLR).

== Introduction ==

Finally we are moving away from wires and voltages and hard-core electrical engineering applications, although we still need to know quite a bit regarding computer chip architectures at this level.  While the primary focus of this section will concentrate on the 8250 UART, there are really three computer chips that we will be working with here:

*8250 UART
*8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller)
*8086 CPU (Central Processing Unit)

Keep in mind that these are chip families, not simply the chip part number itself.  Computer designs have evolved quite a bit over the years, and often all three chips are put onto the same piece of silicon because they are tied together so much, and to reduce overall costs of the equipment.  So when I say 8086, I also mean the successor chips including the 80286, 80386, Pentium, and compatible chips made by manufacturers other than Intel.  There are some subtle differences and things you need to worry about for serial data communication between the different chips other than the 8086, but in many cases you could in theory write software for the original IBM PC doing serial communication and it should run just fine on a modern computer you just bought that is running the latest version of Linux or Windows XP.  

Modern operating systems handle most of the details that we will be covering here through low-level drivers, so this should be more of a quick understanding for how this works rather than something you might implement yourself, unless you are writing your own operating system.  For people who are designing small embedded computer devices, it does become quite a bit more important to understand the 8250 at this level.

Just like the 8086, the 8250 has evolved quite a bit as well, e.g. into the 16550 UART. Further down I will go into how to detect many of the different UART chips on PCs, and some quirks or changes that affect each one.  The differences really aren't as significant as the changes to CPU architecture, and the primary reason for updating the UART chip was to make it work with the considerably faster CPUs that are around right now.  The 8250 itself simply can't keep up with a Pentium chip.

Remember as well that this is trying to build a foundation for serial programming on the software side.  While this can be useful for hardware design as well, quite a bit will be missing from the descriptions here to implement a full system.

== 8086 I/O ports ==
We should go back even further than the Intel 8086, to the original Intel CPU, the 4004, and its successor, the 8008. All computer instructions, or op-codes, for the 8008 still function in today's Intel chips, so even port I/O tutorials written 30 years ago are valid today. The newer CPUs have enhanced instructions for dealing with more data more efficiently, but the original instructions are still there.

When the 8008 was released, Intel tried to devise a method for the CPU to communicate with external devices.  They chose a method called I/O port architecture, meaning that the chip has a special set of pins dedicated to communicating with external devices.  In the 8008, this meant that there were a total of sixteen (16) pins dedicated to communicating with the chip.  The exact details varied based on chip design and other factors too detailed for the current discussion, but the general theory is fairly straightforward.

Eight of the pins represent an I/O code that signaled a specific device.  This is known as the I/O port.  Since this is just a binary code, it represents the potential to hook up 256 different devices to the CPU.  It gets a little more complicated than that, but still you can think of it from software like a small-town post-office that has a bank of 256 PO boxes for its customers.

The next set of pins represent the actual data being exchanged.  You can think of this as the postcards being put into or removed from the PO boxes.

All the external device has to do is look for its I/O code, and then when it matches what it is &quot;assigned&quot; to look for, it has control over the corresponding port.  An pin signals whether the data is being sent to or from the CPU.  For those familiar with setting up early PCs, this is also where I/O conflicts happen: when two or more devices try to access the same I/O port at the same time.  This was a source of heartburn on those early systems, particularly when adding new equipment.

Incidentally, this is very similar to how conventional RAM works, and some CPU designs mimic this whole process straight in RAM, reserving a block of memory for I/O control.  This has some problems, including the fact that it chews up a portion of potential memory that could be used for software instead.  It ends up that with the IBM PC and later PC systems, both Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) and Port-mapped I/O (PMIO) are used extensively, so it really gets complicated.  For serial communication, however, we are going to stick with the port I/O method, as that is how the 8250 chip works.

=== Software I/O access ===

When you get down to actually using this in your software, the assembly language instruction to send or receive data to port 9 looks something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
out 9, al ; sending data from register al out to port 9 
in al, 9 ; getting data from port 9 and putting it in register al
&lt;/pre&gt;

When programming in higher level languages, it gets a bit simpler.  A typical C language Port I/O library is usually written like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
char test;

test = 255;
outp(9,test);
inp(9,&amp;test);
&lt;/pre&gt;

For many versions of Pascal, it treats the I/O ports like a massive array that you can access, that is simply named Port:

&lt;pre&gt;
procedure PortIO(var Test: Byte);
begin
  Port[9] := Test;
  Test := Port[9];
end;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Warning!!''' And this really is a warning.  By randomly accessing I/O ports in your computer without really knowing what it is connected to can really mess up your computer.  At the minimum, it will crash the operating system and cause the computer to not work.  Writing to some I/O ports can permanently change the internal configuration of your computer, making a trip to the repair shop necessary just to undo the damage you've done through software.  Worse yet, in some cases it can cause actual damage to the computer.  This means that some chips inside the computer will no longer work and those components would have to be replaced in order for the computer to work again.  Damaged chips are an indication of lousy engineering on the part of the computer, but unfortunately it does happen and you should be aware of it.

Don't be afraid to use the I/O ports, just make sure you know what you are writing to, and you know what equipment is &quot;mapped&quot; to for each I/O port if you intend to use a particular I/O port.  We will get into more of the specifics for how to identify the I/O ports for serial communication in a bit.  Finally we are starting to write a little bit of software, and there is more to come.

=== x86 port I/O extensions ===

There are a few differences between the 8008 CPU and the 8086.  The most notable that affects software development is that instead of just 256 port I/O addresses, the 8086 can access 65536 different I/O ports.  In addition, besides simply sending a single character in or out, the 8086 will let you send and receive 16 bits at once.  The 386 chips will even let you send and receive 32-bits simultaneously.  The need for more than 65536 different I/O ports has never been a serious problem, and if a device needed a larger piece of memory, the Direct Memory Access (DMA) methods are available.  This is where the device writes and reads the RAM of the computer directly instead of going through the CPU.  We will not cover that topic here.

Also, while the 8086 CPU was able to address 65536 different I/O ports, in actual practice it didn't.  The chip designers at Intel got cheap and only had address lines for 10 bits, which has implications for software designers having to work with legacy systems.  This also meant that I/O port address $1E8 and $19E8 (and others... this is just an example) would resolve to the same I/O port for those early PCs.  The Pentium CPUs don't have this limitation, but software written for some of that early hardware sometimes wrote to I/O port addresses that were &quot;aliased&quot; because those upper bits were ignored.  There are other legacy issues that show up, but fortunately for the 8250 chip and serial communications in general this isn't a concern, unless you happen to have a serial driver that &quot;took advantage&quot; of this aliasing situation.  This issue would generally only show up when you are using more than the typical 2 or 4 serial COM ports on a PC.

== x86 Processor Interrupts ==

The 8086 CPU and compatible chips have what is known as an interrupt line.  This is literally a wire to the rest of the computer that can be turned on to let the CPU know that it is time to stop whatever it is doing and pay attention to some I/O situations.

Within the 8086, there are two kinds of interrupts:  Hardware interrupts and Software interrupts.  There are some interesting quirks that are different from each kind, but from a software perspective they are essentially the same thing.  The 8086 CPU allows for 256 interrupts, but the number available for equipment to perform a Hardware interrupt is considerably restricted.

=== IRQs Explained ===

Hardware interrupts are numbered IRQ 0 through IRQ 15.  IRQ means Interrupt ReQuest.  There are a total of fifteen different hardware interrupts.  Before you think I don't know how to count or do math, we need to do a little bit of a history lesson here, which we will finish when we move on to the 8259 chip.  When the original IBM-PC was built, it only had eight IRQs, labeled IRQ 0 through IRQ 7.  At the time it was felt that was sufficient for almost everything that would ever be put on a PC, but very soon it became apparent it wasn't nearly enough for everything that was being added.  When the IBM-PC/AT was made (the first one with the 80286 CPU, and a number of enhancements that are commonly found on PCs today), it was decided that instead of a single 8259 chip, they would use two of these same chips, and &quot;chain&quot; them to one another in order to expand the number of interrupts from 8 to 15.  One IRQ had to be sacrificed in order to accomplish this task, and that was IRQ 2.

The point here is that if a device wants to notify the CPU that it has some data ready for the CPU, it sends a signal that it wants to stop whatever software is currently running on the computer and instead run a special &quot;little&quot; program called an interrupt handler.  Once the interrupt handler is finished, the computer can go back to whatever it was doing before.  If the interrupt handler is fast enough, you wouldn't even notice that the handler has even been used.

In fact, if you are reading this text on a PC, in the time that it takes for you to read this sentence several interrupt handlers have already been used by your computer.  Every time that you use a keyboard or a mouse, or receive some data over the Internet, an interrupt handler has been used at some point in your computer to retrieve that information.

=== Interrupt handlers ===

We will be getting into specific details of interrupt handlers in a little bit, but now I want to explain just what they are.  Interrupt handlers are a method of showing the CPU exactly what piece of software should be running when the interrupt is triggered.

The 8086 CPU has a portion of RAM that has been established that &quot;points&quot; to where the interrupt software is located elsewhere in RAM.  The advantage of going this route is that the CPU only has to do a simple look-up to find just where the software is, and then transfers software execution to that point in RAM.  This also allows you as a programmer to change where the CPU is &quot;pointing&quot; to in RAM, and instead of going to something in the operating system, you can customize the interrupt handler and put something else there yourself.

How this is best done depends largely on your operating system.  For a simple operating system like MS-DOS, it actually encourages you to directly write these interrupt handlers, particularly when you are working with external peripherals.  Other operating systems like Linux or MS-Windows use the approach of having a &quot;driver&quot; that hooks into these interrupt handlers or service routines, and then the application software deals with the drivers rather than dealing directly with the equipment.  How a program actually does this is very dependent on the specific operating system you would be using.  If you are instead trying to write your own operating system, you would have to write these interrupt handlers directly, and establish the protocol on how you access these handlers to send and retrieve data.

=== Software interrupts ===

Before we move on, I want to hit very briefly on software interrupts.  Software interrupts are invoked with the 8086 assembly instruction &quot;int&quot;, as in:

int $21

From the perspective of a software application, this is really just another way to call a subroutine, but with a twist.  The &quot;software&quot; that is running in the interrupt handler doesn't have to be from the same application, or even made from the same compiler.  Indeed, often these subroutines are written directly in assembly language.  In the above example, this interrupt actually calls a &quot;DOS&quot; subroutine that will allow you to perform some sort of I/O access that is directly related to DOS.  Depending on the values of the registers, usually the AX register in the 8086 in this case, it can determine just what information you want to get from DOS, such as the current time, date, disk size, and just about everything that normally you would associate with DOS.  Compilers often hide these details, because setting up these interrupt routines can be a little tricky.

Now to really make a mess of things.  &quot;Hardware interrupts&quot; can also be called from &quot;software interrupts&quot;, and indeed this is a reasonable way to make sure you have written your software correctly.  The difference here is that software interrupts will only be invoked, or have their portion of software code running in the CPU, if it has been explicitly called through this assembly opcode.

== 8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) ==

The 8259 chip is the &quot;heart&quot; of the whole process of doing hardware interrupts.  External devices are directly connected to this chip, or in the case of the PC-AT compatibles (most likely what you are most familiar with for a modern PC) it will have two of these devices that are connected together.  Literally sixteen wires come into this pair of chips, each wire labeled IRQ-0 through IRQ-15.

The purpose of these chips is to help &quot;prioritize&quot; the interrupt signals and organize them in some orderly fashion.  There is no way to predict when a certain device is going to &quot;request&quot; an interrupt, so often multiple devices can be competing for attention from the CPU.

Generally speaking, the lower numbered IRQ gets priority.  In other words, if both IRQ-1 and IRQ-4 are requesting attention at the same time, IRQ-1 gets priority and will be triggered first as far as the CPU is concerned.  IRQ-4 has to wait until after IRQ-1 has completed its &quot;Interrupt Service Routine&quot; or ISR.

If the opposite happens however, with IRQ-4 doing its ISR (remember, this is software, just like any computer program you might normally write as a computer application), IRQ-1 will &quot;interrupt&quot; the ISR for IRQ-4 and push through its own ISR to be run instead, returning to the IRQ-4 ISR when it has finished.  There are exceptions to this as well, but let's keep things simple at the moment.

Let's return for a minute to the original IBM-PC.  When it was built, there was only one 8259 chip on the motherboard.  When the IBM-AT came out the engineers at IBM decided to add a second 8259 chip to add some additional IRQ signals.  Since there was still only 1 pin on the CPU (at this point the 80286) that could receive notification of an interrupt, it was decided to grab IRQ-2 from the original 8259 chip and use that to chain onto the next chip.  IRQ-2 was re-routed to IRQ-9 as far as any devices that depended on IRQ-2.  The nice thing about going with this scheme was that software that planned on something using IRQ-2 would still be &quot;notified&quot; when that device was used, even though seven other devices were now &quot;sharing&quot; this interrupt.  These are IRQ-8 through IRQ-15.

What this means in terms of priorities, however, is that IRQ-8 through IRQ-15 have a higher priority than IRQ-3.  This is mainly of concern when you are trying to sort out which device can take precedence over another, and how important it would be to notified when a piece of equipment is trying to get your attention.  If you are dealing with software running a specific computer configuration, this priority level is very important.

It should be noted here that COM1 (serial communication channel one) usually uses IRQ-4, and COM2 uses IRQ-3, which has the net effect of making COM2 to be a higher priority for receiving data over COM1.  Usually the software really doesn't care, but on some rare occasions you really need to know this fact.

=== 8259 Registers ===

The 8259 has several &quot;registers&quot; that are associated with I/O port addresses.  We will visit this concept a little bit more when we get to the 8250 chip.  For a typical PC Computer system, the following are typical primary port addresses associated with the 8259:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''Interrupt Controller Port I/O Addresses'''
|-
! Register Name
! I/O Port
|-
| Master Interrupt Controller || $0020
|-
| Slave Interrupt Controller || $00A0
|}

This primary port address is what we will use to directly communicate with the 8259 chip in our software.  There are a number of commands that can be sent to this chip through these I/O port addresses, but for our purposes we really don't need to deal with them.  Most of these are used to do the initial setup and configuration of the computer equipment by the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) of the computer, and unless you are rewriting the BIOS from scratch, you really don't have to worry about this.  Also, each computer is a little different in its behavior when you are dealing with equipment at this level, so this is something more for a computer manufacturer to worry about rather than something an application programmer should have to deal with, which is exactly why BIOS software is written at all.

Keep in mind that this is the &quot;typical&quot; Port I/O address for most PC-compatible type computer systems, and can vary depending on what the manufacturer is trying to accomplish.  Generally you don't have to worry about incompatibility at this level, but when we get to Port I/O addresses for the serial ports this will become a much larger issue.

=== Device Registers ===

I'm going to spend a little time here to explain the meaning of the word register.  When you are working with equipment at this level, the electrical engineers who designed the equipment refer to registers that change the configuration of the equipment.  This can happen at several levels of abstraction, so I want to clear up some of the confusion.

A register is simply a small piece of RAM that is available for a device to directly manipulate.  In a CPU like the 8086 or a Pentium, these are the memory areas that are used to directly perform mathematical operations like adding two numbers together.  These usually go by names like AX, SP, etc.  There are very few registers on a typical CPU because access to these registers is encoded directly into the basic machine-level instructions.

When we are talking about device register, keep in mind these are not the CPU registers, but instead memory areas on the devices themselves.  These are often designed so they are connected to the Port I/O memory, so when you write to or read from the Port I/O addresses, you are directly accessing the device registers.  Sometimes there will be a further level of abstraction, where you will have one Port I/O address that will indicate which register you are changing, and another Port I/O address that has the data you are sending to that register.  How you deal with the device is based on how complex it is and what you are going to be doing.

In a real sense, they are registers, but keep in mind that often each of these devices can be considered a full computer in its own right, and all you are doing is establishing how it will be communicating with the main CPU.  Don't get hung up here and get these confused with the CPU registers.

=== ISR Cleanup ===

One area that you have to interact on a regular basis when using interrupt controllers is to inform the 8259 PIC controller that the interrupt service routine is completed.  When your software is performing an interrupt handler, there is no automated method for the CPU to signal to the 8259 chip that you have finished, so a specific &quot;register&quot; in the PIC needs to be set to let the next interrupt handler be able to access the computer system.  Typical software to accomplish this is like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
  Port[$20] := $20;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is sending the command called &quot;End of Interrupt&quot; or often written as an abbreviation simply &quot;EOI&quot;.  There are other commands that can be sent to this register, but for our purposes this is the only one that we need to concern ourselves with.
;;;
Now this will clear the &quot;master&quot; PIC, but if you are using a device that is triggered on the &quot;slave&quot; PIC, you also need to inform that chip as well that the interrupt service has been completed.  This means you need to send &quot;EOI&quot; to that chip as well in a manner like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
  Port[$A0] := $20;
  Port[$20] := $20;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are other things you can do to make your computer system work smoothly, but let's keep things simple for now.

=== PIC Device Masking ===

Before we leave the subject of the 8259 PIC, I'd like to cover the concept of device masking.  Each one of the devices that are attached to the PIC can be &quot;turned on&quot; or &quot;turned off&quot; from the viewpoint of how they can interrupt the CPU through the PIC chip.  Usually as an application developer all we really care about is if the device is turned on, although if you are trying to isolate performance issues you might turn off some other devices.  Keep in mind that if you turn a device &quot;off&quot;, the interrupt will not work until it is turned back on.  That can include the keyboard or other critical devices you may need to operate your computer.

The register to set this mask is called &quot;Operation Control Word 1&quot; or &quot;OCW1&quot;.  This is located at the PIC base address + 1, or for the &quot;Master&quot; PIC at Port I/O Address $21.  This is where you need to go over bit manipulation, which I won't cover in detail here.  The following tables show the related bits to change in order to enable or disable each of the hardware interrupt devices:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''Master OCW1 ($21)'''
|-
! Bit
! IRQ Enabled''' 
! Device Function
|-
| 7 || IRQ7 || Parallel Port (LPT1)
|-
| 6 || IRQ6 || Floppy Disk Controller
|-
| 5 || IRQ5 || Reserved/Sound Card
|-
| 4 || IRQ4 || Serial Port (COM1)
|-
| 3 || IRQ3 || Serial Port (COM2)
|-
| 2 || IRQ2 || Slave PIC
|-
| 1 || IRQ1 || Keyboard
|-
| 0 || IRQ0 || System Timer
|}



{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''Slave OCW1 ($A1)'''
|-
! Bit
! IRQ Enabled
! Device Function
|-
| 7 || IRQ15 || Reserved
|-
| 6 || IRQ14 || Hard Disk Drive
|-
| 5 || IRQ13 || Math Co-Processor
|-
| 4 || IRQ12 || PS/2 Mouse
|-
| 3 || IRQ11 || PCI Devices
|-
| 2 || IRQ10 || PCI Devices
|-
| 1 || IRQ9 || Redirected IRQ2 Devices
|-
| 0 || IRQ8 || Real Time Clock
|}

Assuming that we want to turn on IRQ3 (typical for the serial port COM2), we would use the following software:

&lt;pre&gt;
  Port[$21] := Port[$21] and $F7; {Clearing bit 3 for enabling IRQ3}
&lt;/pre&gt;

And to turn it off we would use the following software:

&lt;pre&gt;
  Port[$21] := Port[$21] or $08; {Setting bit 3 for disabling IRQ3}
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are having problems getting anything to work, you can simply send this command in your software:

&lt;pre&gt;
  Port[$21] := 0;
&lt;/pre&gt;

which will simply enable everything.  This may not be a good thing to do, but will have to be something for you to experiment with depending on what you are working with.  Try not to take short cuts like this as not only is it a sign of a lazy programmer, but it can have side effects that your computer may behave different than you intended.  If you are working with the computer at this level, the goal is to change as little as possible so you don't cause damage to any other software you are using.

== Serial COM Port Memory and I/O Allocation ==

Now that we have pushed through the 8259 chip, lets move on to the UART itself.  While the Port I/O addresses for the PICs are fairly standard, it is common for computer manufacturers to move stuff around for the serial ports themselves.  Also, if you have serial port devices that are part of an add-in card (like an ISA or PCI card in the expansion slots of your computer), these will usually have different settings than something built into the main motherboard of your computer.  It may take some time to hunt down these settings, and it is important to know what these values are when you are trying to write your software.  Often these values can be found in the BIOS setup screens of your computer, or if you can pause the messages when your computer turns on, they can be found as a part of the boot process of your computer.

For a &quot;typical&quot; PC system, the following are the Port I/O addresses and IRQs for each serial COM port:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''Common UART IRQ and I/O Port Addresses'''
|-
! COM Port
! IRQ
! Base Port I/O address
|-
| COM1 || IRQ4 || $3F8
|-
| COM2 || IRQ3 || $2F8
|-
| COM3 || IRQ4 || $3E8
|-
| COM4 || IRQ3 || $2E8
|}

If you notice something interesting here, you can see that COM3 and COM1 share the same interrupt.  This is not a mistake but something you need to keep in mind when you are writing an interrupt service routine.  The 15 interrupts that were made available through the 8259 PIC chips still have not been enough to allow all of the devices that are found on a modern computer to have their own separate hardware interrupt, so in this case you will need to learn how to share the interrupt with other devices.  I'll cover more of that later when we get into the actual software to access the serial data ports, but for now remember not to write your software strictly for one device.

The Base Port I/O address is important for the next topic we will cover, which is directly accessing the UART registers.

== UART Registers ==

The UART chip has a total of 12 different registers that are mapped into 8 different Port I/O locations.  Yes, you read that correct, 12 registers in 8 locations.  Obviously that means there is more than one register that uses the same Port I/O location, and affects how the UART can be configured.  In reality, two of the registers are really the same one but in a different context, as the Port I/O address that you transmit the characters to be sent out of the serial data port is the same address that you can read in the characters that are sent to the computer.  Another I/O port address has a different context when you write data to it than when you read data from it... and the number will be different after writing the data to it than when you read data from it.  More on that in a little bit.

One of the issues that came up when this chip was originally being designed was that the designer needed to be able to send information about the baud rate of the serial data with 16 bits.  This actually takes up two different &quot;registers&quot; and is toggled by what is called the &quot;Divisor Latch Access Bit&quot; or &quot;DLAB&quot;.  When the DLAB is set to &quot;1&quot;, the baud rate registers can be set and when it is &quot;0&quot; the registers have a different context.

Does all this sound confusing?  It can be, but lets take it one simple little piece at a time.  The following is a table of each of the registers that can be found in a typical UART chip:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''UART Registers'''
|-
! Base Address
! DLAB
! I/O Access
! Abbrv.
! Register Name
|-
| +0 || 0 || Write || THR || Transmitter Holding Buffer
|-
| +0 || 0 || Read || RBR || Receiver Buffer
|-
| +0 || 1 || Read/Write || DLL || Divisor Latch Low Byte
|-
| +1 || 0 || Read/Write || IER || Interrupt Enable Register
|-
| +1 || 1 || Read/Write || DLH || Divisor Latch High Byte
|-
| +2 || x || Read
| IIR || Interrupt Identification Register
|-
| +2 || x || Write || FCR || FIFO Control Register
|-
| +3 || x || Read/Write || LCR || Line Control Register
|-
| +4 || x || Read/Write || MCR || Modem Control Register
|-
| +5 || x || Read || LSR || Line Status Register
|-
| +6 || x || Read || MSR || Modem Status Register
|-
| +7 || x || Read/Write || SR || Scratch Register
|}

The &quot;x&quot; in the DLAB column means that the status of the DLAB has no effect on what register is going to be accessed for that offset range.  Notice also that some registers are Read only.  If you attempt to write data to them, you may end up with either some problems with the modem (worst case), or the data will simply be ignored (typically the result).  As mentioned earlier, some registers share a Port I/O address where one register will be used when you write data to it and another register will be used to retrieve data from the same address.

Each serial communication port will have its own set of these registers.  For example, if you wanted to access the Line Status Register (LSR) for COM1, and assuming the base I/O Port address of $3F8, the I/O Port address to get the information in this register would be found at $3F8 + $05 or $3FD.  Some example code would be like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
const
  COM1_Base = $3F8;
  COM2_Base = $2F8;
  LSR_Offset = $05;

function LSR_Value: Byte;
begin
  Result := Port[COM1_Base+LSR_Offset];
end;
&lt;/pre&gt;

There is quite a bit of information packed into each of these registers, and the following is an explanation for the meaning of each register and the information it contains.

=== Transmitter Holding Buffer/Receiver Buffer ===  
Offset: +0 .
The Transmit and Receive buffers are related, and often even use the very same memory.  This is also one of the areas where later versions of the 8250 chip have a significant impact, as the later models incorporate some internal buffering of the data within the chip before it gets transmitted as serial data.  The base 8250 chip can only receive one byte at a time, while later chips like the 16550 chip will hold up to 16 bytes either to transmit or to receive (sometimes both... depending on the manufacturer) before you have to wait for the character to be sent.  This can be useful in multi-tasking environments where you have a computer doing many things, and it may be a couple of milliseconds before you get back to dealing with serial data flow.

These registers really are the &quot;heart&quot; of serial data communication, and how data is transferred from your software to another computer and how it gets data from other devices.  Reading and Writing to these registers is simply a matter of accessing the Port I/O address for the respective UART.

If the receive buffer is occupied or the FIFO is full, the incoming data is discarded and the Receiver Line Status interrupt is written to the IIR register. The Overrun Error bit is also set in the Line Status Register.

=== Divisor Latch Bytes ===
Offset: +0 and +1 .
The Divisor Latch Bytes are what control the baud rate of the modem.  As you might guess from the name of this register, it is used as a divisor to determine what baud rate that the chip is going to be transmitting at.  

In reality, it is even simpler than that.  This is really a count-down clock that is used each time a bit is transmitted by the UART.  Each time a bit is sent, a count-down register is reset to this value and then counts down to zero.  This clock is running typically at 115.2 KHz.  In other words, at 115 thousand times per second a counter is going down to determine when to send the next bit.  At one time during the design process it was anticipated that some other frequencies might be used to get a UART working, but with the large amount of software already written for this chip this frequency is pretty much standard for almost all UART chips used on a PC platform.  They may use a faster clock in some portion (like a 1.843 MHz clock), but some fraction of that frequency will then be used to scale down to a 115.2 KHz clock.

Some more on UART clock speeds (advanced coverage):  For many UART chips, the clock frequency that is driving the UART is 1.8432 MHz.  This frequency is then put through a divider circuit that drops the frequency down by a factor of 16, giving us the 115.2 KHz frequency mentioned above.  If you are doing some custom equipment using this chip, the National Semiconductor spec sheets allow for a 3.072 MHz clock and 18.432 MHz clock.  These higher frequencies will allow you to communicate at higher baud rates, but require custom circuits on the motherboard and often new drivers in order to deal with these new frequencies.  What is interesting is that you can still operate at 50 baud with these higher clock frequencies, but at the time the original IBM-PC/XT was manufactured this wasn't a big concern as it is now for higher data throughput.

If you use the following mathematical formula, you can determine what numbers you need to put into the Divisor Latch Bytes:

::&lt;math&gt;{Divisor Latch Value} = {115200 \over {Baud Rate}}&lt;/math&gt;

That gives you the following table that can be used to determine common baud rates for serial communication:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''Divisor Latch Byte Values (common baud rates)'''
|-
! Baud Rate
! Divisor (in decimal)
! Divisor Latch High Byte
! Divisor Latch Low Byte
|-
| 50 || 2304 || $09 || $00
|-
| 110 || 1047 || $04 || $17
|-
| 220 || 524 || $02 || $0C
|-
| 300 || 384 || $01 || $80
|-
| 600 || 192 || $00 || $C0
|-
| 1200 || 96 || $00 || $60
|-
| 2400 || 48 || $00 || $30
|-
| 4800 || 24 || $00 || $18
|-
| 9600 || 12 || $00 || $0C
|-
| 19200 || 6 || $00 || $06
|-
| 38400 || 3 || $00 || $03
|-
| 57600 || 2 || $00 || $02
|-
| 115200 || 1 || $00 || $01
|}

One thing to keep in mind when looking at the table is that baud rates 600 and above all set the Divisor Latch High Byte to zero.  A sloppy programmer might try to skip setting the high byte, assuming that nobody would deal with such low baud rates, but this is not something to always presume.  Good programming habits suggest you should still try to set this to zero even if all you are doing is running at higher baud rates.

Another thing to notice is that there are other potential baud rates other than the standard ones listed above.  While this is not encouraged for a typical application, it would be something fun to experiment with.  Also, you can attempt to communicate with older equipment in this fashion where a standard API library might not allow a specific baud rate that should be compatible.  This should demonstrate why knowledge of these chips at this level is still very useful.

When working with these registers, also remember that these are the only ones that require the Divisor Latch Access Bit to be set to &quot;1&quot;.  More on that below, but I'd like to mention that it would be useful for application software setting the baud rate to set the DLAB to &quot;1&quot; just for the immediate operation of changing the baud rate, then putting it back to &quot;0&quot; as the very next step before you do any more I/O access to the modem.  This is just a good working habit, and keeps the rest of the software you need to write for accessing the UART much cleaner and easier.

One word of caution:  Do not set the value &quot;0&quot; for both Divisor Latch bytes.  While it will not (likely) damage the UART chip, the behavior on how the UART will be transmitting serial data will be unpredictable, and will change from one computer to the next, or even from one time you boot the computer to the next.  This is an error condition, and if you are writing software that works with baud rate settings on this level you should catch potential &quot;0&quot; values for the Divisor Latch.

Here is some sample software to set and retrieve the baud rate for COM1:

&lt;pre&gt;
const
  COM1_Base = $3F8;

=== Interrupt Enable Register ===
Offset: +1 .
This register allows you to control when and how the UART is going to trigger an interrupt event with the hardware interrupt associated with the serial COM port.  If used properly, this can enable an efficient use of system resources and allow you to react to information being sent across a serial data line in essentially real-time conditions.  Some more on that will be covered later, but the point here is that you can use the UART to let you know exactly when you need to extract some data.  This register has both read- and write-access.

The following is a table showing each bit in this register and what events that it will enable to allow you check on the status of this chip:

|-

|}

The Received Data interrupt is a way to let you know that there is some data waiting for you to pull off of the UART.  This is probably the one bit that you will use more than the rest, and has more use.

The Transmitter Holding Register Empty Interrupt is to let you know that the output buffer (on more advanced models of the chip like the 16550) has finished sending everything that you pushed into the buffer.  This is a way to streamline the data transmission routines so they take up less CPU time.

The Receiver Line Status Interrupt indicates that something in the LSR register has probably changed.  This is usually an error condition, and if you are going to write an efficient error handler for the UART that will give plain text descriptions to the end user of your application, this is something you should consider. This is certainly something that takes a bit more advanced knowledge of programming.

The Modem Status Interrupt is to notify you when something changes with an external modem connected to your computer.  This can include things like the telephone &quot;bell&quot; ringing (you can simulate this in your software), that you have successfully connected to another modem (Carrier Detect has been turned on), or that somebody has &quot;hung up&quot; the telephone (Carrier Detect has turned off).  It can also help you to know if the external modem or data equipment can continue to receive data (Clear to Send).  Essentially, this deals with the other wires in the RS-232 standard other than strictly the transmit and receive wires.

The other two modes are strictly for the 16750 chip, and help put the chip into a &quot;low power&quot; state for use on things like a laptop computer or an embedded controller that has a very limited power source like a battery.  On earlier chips you should treat these bits as &quot;Reserved&quot;, and only put a &quot;0&quot; into them.

=== Interrupt Identification Register ===
Offset: +2 .
This register is to be used to help identify what the unique characteristics of the UART chip that you are using has.  This chip has two uses:

* Identification of why the UART triggered an interrupt.
* Identification of the UART chip itself.

Of these, identification of why the interrupt service routine has been invoked is perhaps the most important.

The following table explains some of the details of this register, and what each bit on it represents:

When you are writing an interrupt handler for the 8250 chip (and later), this is the register that you need to look at in order to determine what exactly was the trigger for the interrupt.  

As explained earlier, multiple serial communication devices can share the same hardware interrupt.  The use of &quot;Bit 0&quot; of this register will let you know (or confirm) that this was indeed the device that caused the interrupt.  What you need to do is check on all serial devices (that are in separate port I/O address spaces), and get the contents of this register.  Keep in mind that it is at least possible for more than one device to trigger an interrupt at the same time, so when you are doing this scanning of serial devices, make sure you examine all of them, even one of the first devices did in fact need to be processed.  Some computer systems may not require this to occur, but this is a good programming practice anyway.  It is also possible that due to how you processed the UARTs earlier, that you have already dealt with all of the UARTs for a given interrupt.  When this bit is a &quot;0&quot;, it identifies that the UART is triggering an interrupt.  When it is &quot;1&quot;, that means the interrupt has already been processed or this particular UART was not the triggering device.  I know that this seems a little bit backward for a typical bit-flag used in computers, but this is called digital logic being asserted low, and is fairly common with electrical circuit design.  This is a bit more unusual through for this logic pattern to go into the software domain.

Bits 1, 2 &amp; 3 help to identify exactly what sort of interrupt event was used within the UART to invoke the hardware interrupt.  These are the same interrupts that were earlier enabled with the IER register.  In this case, however, each time you process the registers and deal with the interrupt it will be unique.  If multiple &quot;triggers&quot; occur for the UART due to many things happening at the same time, this will be invoked through multiple hardware interrupts.  Earlier chip sets don't use bit 3, but this is a reserved bit on those UART systems and always set to logic state &quot;0&quot;, so programming logic doesn't have to be different when trying to decipher which interrupt has been used.

To explain the FIFO timeout Interrupt, this is a way to check for the end of a packet or if the incoming data stream has stopped.  Generally the following conditions must exist for this interrupt to be triggered:  Some data needs to be in the incoming FIFO and has not been read by the computer.  Data transmissions being sent to the UART via serial data link must have ended with no new characters being received.  The CPU processing incoming data must not have retrieved any data from the FIFO before the timeout has occurred.  The timeout will occur usually after the period it would take to transmit or receive at least 4 characters.  If you are talking about data sent at 1200 baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, odd parity, that would take about 40 milliseconds, which is almost an eternity in terms of things that your computer can accomplish on a 4 GHz Pentium CPU.

The &quot;Reset Method&quot; listed above describes how the UART is notified that a given interrupt has been processed.  When you access the register mentioned under the reset method, this will clear the interrupt condition for that UART.  If multiple interrupts for the same UART have been triggered, either it won't clear the interrupt signal on the CPU (triggering a new hardware interrupt when you are done), or if you check back to this register (IIR) and query the Interrupt Pending Flag to see if there are more interrupts to process, you can move on and attempt to resolve any new interrupt issue that you may have to deal with, using appropriate application code.

Bits 5, 6 &amp; 7 are reporting the current status of FIFO buffers being used for transmitting and receiving characters.  There was a bug in the original 16550 chip design when it was first released that had a serious flaw in the FIFO, causing the FIFO to report that it was working but in fact it wasn't.  Because some software had already been written to work with the FIFO, this bit (Bit 7 of this register) was kept, but Bit 6 was added to confirm that the FIFO was in fact working correctly, in case some new software wanted to ignore the hardware FIFO on the earlier versions of the 16550 chip.  This pattern has been kept on future versions of this chip as well.  On the 16750 chip an added 64-byte FIFO has been implemented, and Bit 5 is used to designate the presence of this extended buffer.  These FIFO buffers can be turned on and off using registers listed below.

=== FIFO Control Register ===
Offset: +2 .
This is a relatively &quot;new&quot; register that was not a part of the original 8250 UART implementation.  The purpose of this register is to control how the First In/First Out (FIFO) buffers will behave on the chip and to help you fine-tune their performance in your application.  This even gives you the ability to &quot;turn on&quot; or &quot;turn off&quot; the FIFO.

Keep in mind that this is a &quot;write only&quot; register.  Attempting to read in the contents will only give you the Interrupt Identification Register (IIR), which has a totally different context.

Writing a &quot;0&quot; to bit 0 will disable the FIFOs, in essence turning the UART into 8250 compatibility mode.  In effect this also renders the rest of the settings in this register to become useless.  If you write a &quot;0&quot; here it will also stop the FIFOs from sending or receiving data, so any data that is sent through the serial data port may be scrambled after this setting has been changed.  It would be recommended to disable FIFOs only if you are trying to reset the serial communication protocol and clearing any working buffers you may have in your application software.  Some documentation suggests that setting this bit to &quot;0&quot; also clears the FIFO buffers, but I would recommend explicit buffer clearing instead using bits 1 and 2.

Bits 1 and 2 are used to clear the internal FIFO buffers.  This is useful when you are first starting up an application where you might want to clear out any data that may have been &quot;left behind&quot; by a previous piece of software using the UART, or if you want to reset a communications connection.  These bits are &quot;automatically&quot; reset, so if you set either of these to a logical &quot;1&quot; state you will not have to go and put them back to &quot;0&quot; later.  Sending a logical &quot;0&quot; only tells the UART not to reset the FIFO buffers, even if other aspects of FIFO control are going to be changed.

Bit 3 is in reference to how the DMA (Direct Memory Access) takes place, primarily when you are trying to retrieve data from the FIFO.  This would be useful primarily to a chip designer who is trying to directly access the serial data, and store this data in an internal buffer.  There are two digital logic pins on the UART chip itself labeled RXRDY and TXRDY.  If you are trying to design a computer circuit with the UART chip this may be useful or even important, but for the purposes of an application developer on a PC system it is of little use and you can safely ignore it.

Bit 5 allows the 16750 UART chip to expand the buffers from 16 bytes to 64 bytes.  Not only does this affect the size of the buffer, but it also controls the size of the trigger threshold, as described next.  On earlier chip types this is a reserved bit and should be kept in a logical &quot;0&quot; state.  On the 16750 it make that UART perform more like the 16550 with only a 16 byte FIFO.

Bits 6 and 7 describe the trigger threshold value.  This is the number of characters that would be stored in the FIFO before an interrupt is triggered that will let you know data should be removed from the FIFO.  If you anticipate that large amounts of data will be sent over the serial data link, you might want to increase the size of the buffer.  The reason why the maximum value for the trigger is less than the size of the FIFO buffer is because it may take a little while for some software to access the UART and retrieve the data.  Remember that when the FIFO is full, you will start to lose data from the FIFO, so it is important to make sure you have retrieved the data once this threshold has been reached.  If you are encountering software timing problems in trying to retrieve the UART data, you might want to lower the threshold value.  At the extreme end where the threshold is set to 1 byte, it will act essentially like the basic 8250, but with the added reliability that some characters may get caught in the buffer in situations where you don't have a chance to get all of them immediately.

=== Line Control Register ===
Offset: +3 .
This register has two major purposes:

* Setting the Divisor Latch Access Bit (DLAB), allowing you to set the values of the Divisor Latch Bytes.
* Setting the bit patterns that will be used for both receiving and transmitting the serial data.  In other words, the serial data protocol you will be using (8-1-None, 5-2-Even, etc.).

The first two bits (Bit 0 and Bit 1) control how many data bits are sent for each data &quot;word&quot; that is transmitted via serial protocol.  For most serial data transmission, this will be 8 bits, but you will find some of the earlier protocols and older equipment that will require fewer data bits.  For example, some military encryption equipment only uses 5 data bits per serial &quot;word&quot;, as did some TELEX equipment.  Early ASCII teletype terminals only used 7 data bits, and indeed this heritage has been preserved with SMTP format that only uses 7-bit ASCII for e-mail messages.  Clearly this is something that needs to be established before you are able to successfully complete message transmission using RS-232 protocol.

Bit 2 controls how many stop bits are transmitted by the UART to the receiving device.  This is selectable as either one or two stop bits, with a logical &quot;0&quot; representing 1 stop bit and &quot;1&quot; representing 2 stop bits.  In the case of 5 data bits, the RS-232 protocol instead sends out &quot;1.5 stop bits&quot;.  What this means is that one serial data &quot;word&quot; is transmitted with only 1 stop bit, and then the next one is transmitted with 2 stop bits.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the RS-232 standard only specifies that at least one data bit cycle will be kept a logical &quot;1&quot; at the end of each serial data word (in other words, a complete character from start bit, data bits, parity bits, and stop bits).  If you are having timing problems between the two computers but are able to in general get the character sent across one at a time, you might want to add a second stop bit instead of reducing baud rate.  This adds a one-bit penalty to the transmission speed per character instead of halving the transmission speed by dropping the baud rate (usually).

Bits 3, 4, and 5 control how each serial word responds to parity information.  When Bit 3 is a logical &quot;0&quot;, this causes no parity bits to be sent out with the serial data word.  Instead it moves on immediately to the stop bits, and is an admission that parity checking at this level is really useless.  You might still gain a little more reliability with data transmission by including the parity bits, but there are other more reliable and practical ways that will be discussed in other chapters in this book.  If you want to include parity checking, the following explains each parity method other than &quot;none&quot; parity:

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Odd Parity&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Each bit the data portion of the serial word is added as a simple count of the number of logical &quot;1&quot; bits.  If this is an odd number of bits, the parity bit will be transmitted as a logical &quot;1&quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Even Parity&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Like Odd Parity, the bits are added together.  In this case, however, if the number of bits end up as an even number it will display as a logical &quot;1&quot;, which is the exact opposite of odd parity.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Mark Parity&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;In this case the parity bit will always be a logical &quot;1&quot;.  While this may seem a little unusual, this is put in for testing and diagnostics purposes.  If you want to make sure that the software on the receiving end of the serial connection is responding correctly to a parity error, you can send a Mark or a Space parity, and send characters that don't meet what the receiving UART or device is expecting for parity.  In addition for Mark Parity only, you can use this bit as an extra &quot;stop bit&quot;.  Keep in mind that RS-232 standards are expecting a logical &quot;1&quot; to end a serial data word, so a receiving computer will not be able to tell the difference between a &quot;Mark&quot; parity bit and a stop bit.  In essence, you can have 3 or 2.5 stop bits through the use of this setting and by appropriate use of the stop bit portion of this register as well.  This is a way to &quot;tweak&quot; the settings on your computer in a way that typical applications don't allow you to do, or at least gain a deeper insight into serial data settings.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Space Parity&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Like the Mark parity, this makes the parity bit &quot;sticky&quot;, so it doesn't change.  In this case it puts in a logical &quot;0&quot; for the parity bit every time you transmit a character.  There are not many practical uses for doing this other than a crude way to put in 9 data bits for each serial word, or for diagnostics purposes.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

=== Modem Control Register ===
Offset: +4 .
This register allows you to do &quot;hardware&quot; flow control, under software control.  Or in a more practical manner, it allows direct manipulation of four different wires on the UART that you can set to any series of independent logical states, and be able to offer control of the modem.  It should also be noted that most UARTs need Auxiliary Output 2 set to a logical &quot;1&quot; to enable interrupts.

|-

|}

Of these outputs on a typical PC platform, only the Request to Send (RTS) and Data Terminal Ready (DTR) are actually connected to the output of the PC on the DB-9 connector.  If you are fortunate to have a DB-25 serial connector (more commonly used for parallel communications on a PC platform), or if you have a custom UART on an expansion card, the auxiliary outputs might be connected to the RS-232 connection.  If you are using this chip as a component on a custom circuit, this would give you some &quot;free&quot; extra output signals you can use in your chip design to signal anything you might want to have triggered by a TTL output, and would be under software control.  There are easier ways to do this, but in this case it might save you an extra chip on your layout.

The &quot;loopback&quot; mode is primarily a way to test the UART to verify that the circuits are working between your main CPU and the UART.  This seldom, if ever, needs to be tested by an end user, but might be useful for some initial testing of some software that uses the UART.  When this is set to a logical state of &quot;1&quot;, any character that gets put into the transmit register will immediately be found in the receive register of the UART.  Other logical signals like the RTS and DTS listed above will show up in the modem status register just as if you had put a loopback RS-232 device on the end of your serial communication port.  In short, this allows you to do a loopback test using just software.  Except for these diagnostics purposes and for some early development testing of software using the UART, this will never be used.

On the 16750 there is a special mode that can be invoked using the Modem Control Register.  Basically this allows the UART to directly control the state of the RTS and DTS for hardware character flow control, depending on the current state of the FIFO.  This behavior is also affected by the status of Bit 5 of the FIFO Control Register (FCR).  While this is useful, and can change some of the logic on how you would write UART control software, the 16750 is comparatively new as a chip and not commonly found on many computer systems.  If you know your computer has a 16750 UART, have fun taking advantage of this increased functionality.

=== Line Status Register ===
Offset: +5 . 
This register is used primarily to give you information on possible error conditions that may exist within the UART, based on the data that has been received.  Keep in mind that this is a &quot;read only&quot; register, and any data written to this register is likely to be ignored or worse, cause different behavior in the UART.  There are several uses for this information, and some information will be given below on how it can be useful for diagnosing problems with your serial data connection:

|}

Bit 7 refers to errors that are with characters in the FIFO.  If any character that is currently in the FIFO has had one of the other error messages listed here (like a framing error, parity error, etc.), this is reminding you that the FIFO needs to be cleared as the character data in the FIFO is unreliable and has one or more errors.  On UART chips without a FIFO this is a reserved bit field.

Bits 5 and 6 refer to the condition of the character transmitter circuits and can help you to identify if the UART is ready to accept another character.  Bit 6 is set to a logical &quot;1&quot; if all characters have been transmitted (including the FIFO, if active), and the &quot;shift register&quot; is done transmitting as well.  This shift register is an internal memory block within the UART that grabs data from the Transmitter Holding Buffer (THB) or the FIFO and is the circuitry that does the actual transformation of the data to a serial format, sending out one bit of the data at a time and &quot;shifting&quot; the contents of the shift register down one bit to get the value of the next bit.  Bit 5 merely tells you that the UART is capable of receiving more characters, including into the FIFO for transmitting.

The Break Interrupt (Bit 4) gets to a logical state of &quot;1&quot; when the serial data input line has not received any new bits for a period of time that is at least as long as an entire serial data &quot;word&quot;, including the start bit, data bits, parity bit, and stop bits, for the given baud rate in the Divisor Latch Bytes.  Usually this means that the device that is sending serial data to your computer has stopped for some reason.  Often with serial communications this is a normal condition, but in this way you have a way to monitor just how the other device is functioning.

Framing errors (Bit 3) occur when the last bit is not a stop bit.  Or to be more precise the stop bit is a logical &quot;0&quot;.  There are several causes for this, including that you have the timing between the two computer mismatched.  This is usually caused by a mismatch in baud rate, although other causes might be involved as well, including problems in the physical cabling between the devices or that the cable is too long.  You may even have the number of data bits off, so when errors like this are encountered, check the serial data protocol very closely to make sure that all of the settings for the UART (data bit length, parity, and stop bit count) are what should be expected.

Parity errors (Bit 2) can also indicate a mismatched baud rate like the framing errors (particularly if both errors are occurring at the same time).  This bit is raised when the parity algorithm that is expected (odd, even, mark, or space) has not been found.  If you are using &quot;no parity&quot; in the setup of the UART, this bit should always be a logical &quot;0&quot;.  When framing errors are not occurring, this is a way to identify that there are some problems with the cabling, although there are other issues you may have to deal with as well.

Overrun errors (Bit 1) are a sign of poor programming or an operating system that is not giving you proper access to the UART.  This error condition occurs when there is a character waiting to be read, and the incoming shift register is attempting to move the contents of the next character into the Receiver Buffer (RBR).  On UARTs with a FIFO, this also indicates that the FIFO is full as well.  

Some things you can do to help get rid of this error including looking at how efficient your software is that is accessing the UART, particularly the part that is monitoring and reading incoming data.  On multi-tasking operating systems, you might want to make sure that the portion of the software that reads incoming data is on a separate thread, and that the thread priority is high or time-critical, as this is a very important operation for software that uses serial communications data.  A good software practice for applications also includes adding in an application specific &quot;buffer&quot; that is done through software, giving your application more opportunity to be able to deal with the incoming data as necessary, and away from the time critical subroutines needed to get the data off of the UART.  This buffer can be as small as 1KB to as large as 1MB, and depends substantially on the kind of data that you are working with.  There are other more exotic buffering techniques as well that apply to the realm of application development, and that will be covered in later modules.

If you are working with simpler operating systems like MS-DOS or a real-time operating system, there is a distinction between a poll-driven access to the UART vs. interrupt driven software.  Writing an interrupt driver is much more efficient, and there will be a whole section of this book that will go into details of how to write software for UART access.

Finally, when you can't seem to solve the problems of trying to prevent overrun errors from showing up, you might want to think about reducing the baud rate for the serial transmission.  This is not always an option, and really should be the option of last choice when trying to resolve this issue in your software.  As a quick test to simply verify that the fundamental algorithms are working, you can start with a slower baud rate and gradually go to higher speeds, but that should only be done during the initial development of the software, and not something that gets released to a customer or placed as publicly distributed software.

The Data Ready Bit (Bit 0) is really the simplest part here.  This is a way to simply inform you that there is data available for your software to extract from the UART.  When this bit is a logical &quot;1&quot;, it is time to read the Receiver Buffer (RBR).  On UARTs with a FIFO that is active, this bit will remain in a logical &quot;1&quot; state until you have read all of the contents of the FIFO.

=== Modem Status Register ===
Offset: +6 . 
This register is another read-only register that is here to inform your software about the current status of the modem.  The modem accessed in this manner can either be an external modem, or an internal modem that uses a UART as an interface to the computer.

|-
| 3 || Delta Data Carrier Detect
|-
| 2 || Trailing Edge Ring Indicator
|-
| 1 || Delta Data Set Ready
|-
| 0 || Delta Clear To Send
|}

Bits 7 and 6 are directly related to modem activity.  Carrier Detect will stay in a logical state of &quot;1&quot; while the modem is &quot;connect&quot; to another modem.  When this goes to a logical state of &quot;0&quot;, you can assume that the phone connection has been lost.  The Ring Indicator bit is directly tied to the RS-232 wire also labeled &quot;RI&quot; or Ring Indicator.  Usually this bit goes to a logical state of &quot;1&quot; as a result of the &quot;ring voltage&quot; on the telephone line is detected, like when a conventional telephone will be ringing to inform you that somebody is trying to call you.  

When we get to the section of AT modem commands, there will be other methods that can be shown to inform you about this and other information regarding the status of a modem, and instead this information will be sent as characters in the normal serial data stream instead of special wires.  In truth, these extra bits are pretty worthless, but have been a part of the specification from the beginning and comparatively easy for UART designers to implement.  It may, however, be a way to efficiently send some additional information or allow a software designer using the UART to get some logical bit signals from other devices for other purposes.

The &quot;Data Set Ready&quot; and &quot;Clear To Send&quot; bits (Bits 4 and 5) are found directly on an RS-232 cable, and are matching wires to &quot;Request To Send&quot; and &quot;Data Terminal Ready&quot; that are transmitted with the &quot;Modem Control Register (MCR).  With these four bits in two registers, you can perform &quot;hardware flow control&quot;, where you can signal to the other device that it is time to send more data, or to hold back and stop sending data while you are trying to process the information.  More will be written about this subject in another module when we get to data flow control.

A note regarding the &quot;delta&quot; bits (Bits 0, 1, 2, and 3).  In this case the word &quot;delta&quot; means change, as in a change in the status of one of the bits.  This comes from other scientific areas like rocket science where delta-vee means a change in velocity.  For the purposes of this register, each of these bits will be a logical &quot;1&quot; the next time you access this Modem Status register if the bit it is associated with (like Delta Data Carrier Detect with Carrier Detect) has changed its logical state from the previous time you accessed this register.  The Trailing Edge Ring Indicator is pretty much like the rest, except it is in a logical &quot;1&quot; state only if the &quot;Ring Indicator&quot; bit went from a logical &quot;1&quot; to a logical &quot;0&quot; condition.  There really isn't much practical use for this knowledge, but there is some software that tries to take advantage of these bits and perform some manipulation of the data received from the UART based on these bits.  If you ignore these 4 bits you can still make a very robust serial communications software.

=== Scratch Register ===
Offset: +7 . 
The Scratch Register is an interesting enigma.  So much effort was done to try and squeeze a whole bunch of registers into all of the other I/O port addresses that the designers had an extra &quot;register&quot; that they didn't know what to do with.  Keep in mind that when dealing with computer architecture, it is easier when dealing with powers of 2, so they were &quot;stuck&quot; with having to address 8 I/O ports.  Allowing another device to use this extra I/O port would make the motherboard design far too complicated.

On some variants of the 8250 UART, any data written to this scratch register will be available to software when you read the I/O port for this register.  In effect, this gives you one extra byte of &quot;memory&quot; that you can use in your applications in any way that you find useful.  Other than a virus author (maybe I shouldn't give any ideas), there isn't really a good use for this register.  Of limited use is the fact that you can use this register to identify specific variations of the UART because the original 8250 did not store the data sent to it through this register.  As that chip is hardly ever used anymore on a PC design (those companies are using more advanced chips like the 16550), you will not find that &quot;bug&quot; in most modern PC-type platforms.  More details will be given below on how to identify through software which UART chip is being used in your computer, and for each serial port.

== Software Identification of the UART ==

Just as it is possible to identify many of the components on a computer system through just software routines, it is also possible to detect which version or variant of the UART that is found on your computer as well.  The reason this is possible is because each different version of the UART chip has some unique qualities that if you do a process of elimination you can identify which version you are dealing with.  This can be useful information if you are trying to improve performance of the serial I/O routines, know if there are buffers available for transmitting and sending information, as well as simply getting to know the equipment on your PC better.

One example of how you can determine the version of the UART is if the Scratch Register is working or not.  On the first 8250 and 8250A chips, there was a flaw in the design of those chip models where the Scratch Register didn't work.  If you write some data to this register and it comes back changed, you know that the UART in your computer is one of these two chip models.

Another place to look is with the FIFO control registers.  If you set bit &quot;0&quot; of this register to a logical '''1''', you are trying to enable the FIFOs on the UART, which are only found in the more recent version of this chip.  Reading bits &quot;6&quot; and &quot;7&quot; will help you to determine if you are using either the 16550 or 16550A chip.  Bit &quot;5&quot; will help you determine if the chip is the 16750.

Below is a full pseudo code algorithm to help you determine the type of chip you are using:

 Set the value &quot;0xE7&quot; to the FCR to test the status of the FIFO flags.
 Read the value of the IIR to test for what flags actually got set.
 If Bit 6 is set Then
   If Bit 7 is set Then
     If Bit 5 is set Then
       UART is 16750
     Else
       UART is 16550A
     End If
   Else
     UART is 16550
   End If
 Else you know the chip doesn't use FIFO, so we need to check the scratch register
   Set some arbitrary value like 0x2A to the Scratch Register.  
   You don't want to use 0xFF or 0x00 as those might be returned by the Scratch Register instead for a false postive result.
   Read the value of the Scratch Register
   If the arbitrary value comes back identical
     UART is 16450
   Else
     UART is 8250
   End If
 End If

When written in Pascal, the above algorithm ends up looking like this:

 const
   COM1_Addr = $3F8;
   FCR = 2;
   IIR = 2;
   SCR = 7;
 
 function IdentifyUART: String;
 var
   Test: Byte;
 begin
   Port[COM1_Addr + FCR] := $E7;
   Test := Port[COM1_Addr + IIR];
   if (Test and $40) &gt; 0 then
     if (Test and $80) &gt; 0 then
       if (Test and $20) &gt; 0 then
         IdentifyUART := '16750'
       else
         IdentifyUART := '16550A'
     else
       IdentifyUART := '16550'
   else begin
     Port[COM1_Addr + SCR] := $2A;
     if Port[COM1_Addr + SCR] = $2A then
       IdentifyUART := '16450'
     else
       IdentifyUART := '8250';
   end;
 end;

We still havn't identified between the 8250, 8250A, or 8250B; but that is rather pointless anyway on most current computers as it is very unlikely to even find one of those chips because of their age.

A very similar procedure can be used to determine the CPU of a computer, but that is beyond the scope of this book.

should the rice/lentils be cooked before frying?  this isnt clear from inspection of the recipe.

no, they should not be cooked before frying, fry them dry

Shouldn't this say &quot;Serve with yogurt&quot;? lol
~Khadijha


very good recipe. i simplified it further by adding the chopped onion to the lentils 5 minutes before they were done and letting it cook that way. they steam nicely.
:granted, there's no right or wrong in cooking, but you're '''really''' missing out if you do it that way.. a big part of the flavor comes from getting those onions good and carmelized.. believe me, just try it once: cook them for 30-60 minutes nice and slow until they get droolingly browned and then add them in (if you do this and toast the rice and the lentils, you don't even need the spices.. just a good bit of salt and you will have an ultra-simple and tasty dish)

== Help ==
* I tried to fry the lentis , then add a cup of water. however when i added the first cup it nearly went boom. i stirred. then i left it to boil with closed cap. then it went boom. So i kept stirring it:). What should i do to keep it from going boom? [[User:Enfwm|Enfwm]]

Try using hot water from a kettle. This helps as both the water and the ingredients are the same temperature. If you add tap water that may cause your recipe to go 'Boom'.

== Edit war ==

As of 5 Jul 2008, there seems to be an edit war going on, with various parties 
claiming that the recipe is Palestinian, Israeli, or Levantine.  
Too bad I don't have experience with shuttle diplomacy. :-)

According to 
http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/03/into-pantry.html, it's also Lebanese.
According to http://frugalcuisine.blogspot.com/2006/05/mujadara.html, it's a Middle Eastern recipe.  

I figure that none of the participants in the edit war are in a position to know
that it isn't cooked in any of the other countries, so claiming it's Middle Eastern
seems best.  -- Tim Freeman tim@fungible.com 64.161.114.2</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Playing by ear is both inherently difficult and inherently easy due to two things:

#The music is played as heard &amp;mdash; therefore, rhythmic values and expression are easier to pick up and replicate in one's own playing.
#The music is, more often than not, unknown as a piece to play to whomever is playing it, and as a consequence he or she, depending on the attention to which they feel inclined to play the piece, will have to work out key, chord changes, melody, harmony and technicalities like fingering on their own.

Some people have a gift known as [[Wikipedia:Absolute pitch|perfect pitch]], that is, they are able to tell from listening to a specific note or chord what it is. This may aid them immensely when they try to transcribe a piece of music or play it by ear.

The best way to learn to play by ear is to first develop your ear, that is, play easy songs without notation. Play along to the song, so you know you are in the right key and ''always'' use an instrument that is in tune (if applicable). If you are blessed with a particularly good memory, you will be able to memorize songs and chord changes without too much difficulty. This gift does not have a name, but is comparable to perfect pitch in its use and applications. Playing songs in one's head in the right key is not difficult after some ear development, so play by ear when you don't have notation.

Not all people have the gift of perfect pitch, but one skill that you can develop is the ability to recognize relative pitch. That is, being able to tell what a note is by relating it to a reference note, or being able to tell what a specific chord is by correctly hearing the relative intervals between the notes within the chord. This ability would be a more useful tool for learning to play any song in any key. For example, you hear the first three notes of the melody of a certain song. Although you would not be able to exactly pinpoint what the actual notes are, you would still be able to duplicate what you heard (but perhaps not in the original key) by identifying the intervals between those three notes.

Learning this skill means learning to play, and more importantly, hear the different intervals between notes: unison, minor 2nd, major 2nd, minor 3rd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, and so on.

Ideas about a new book. Still sketchy. I'm trying to come up with an introduction and an approximate first chapter before I move it to a more publicly accessible location.  If someone stumbles upon this and wants to implement their own thoughts, please do so or startup further discussion. I'm contemplating trying to give this more of an academic journal feel by using many citations. Don't know if this would work in a Wiki environment.

Purpose: {Still deciding; options below; maybe the two points below are two parts of the book.}
#Teach information seekers how to form accurate searches in electronic environments.
#To provide a quick reference guide to advanced searching mechanisms of electronic information.
Scope: Any electronic search environment.  Examples include: Google, Pubmed, grep, Amazon, local library online catalogs...

Audience: All information seekers in electronic environments.

Authority: Authority will be higher if authors use external hyperlinks to the search engine or software provider's own documents.

== How to search... ==
===Introduction===
When people began using computer technology and storing electronic documents, they needed new methods of finding those documents. Technical requirements governed the methods. Computers were built using logic gates which were either on or off, 0 or 1, and could calculate operations in boolean algebra. They recognized no other language and could accept no other input. With this in mind, it is little surprise that methods of finding documents also involved the use of boolean algebra.

Today, computers are still built from logic gates and we still use boolean algebra to search for documents. But, ingenious people have created ways to search for documents even when someone knows little about boolean algebra. These ways, often manifested in the form of templates, may be available with many popular search interfaces but not for all.  When it comes to exact searches though (those that return the most accurate set of results according to the user's need), knowing boolean algebra and the inner workings behind the search are very helpful.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In this section, we will define what a topology is and give some examples and basic constructions.
{{TOC right}}

== Motivation ==
In Abstract [[Algebra]], a ''field'' generalizes the concept of operations on the real number line.  This general definition allows concepts about quite different mathematical objects to be grasped intuitively by comparison with the real numbers.  Likewise, the concept of a '''topological space''' is concerned with generalizing the structure of sets in Euclidean spaces. Of course, for many topological spaces the similarities are remote, but aid in judgment and guide proofs.  Interesting differences in the structure of sets in Euclidean space, which have analogies in topological spaces, are connectedness, compactness, dimensionality, and the presence of &quot;holes&quot;.  

If we begin with an arbitrary set, it may not be immediately obvious what is needed to imbue it with an interesting structure.  One possibility might be to define a [[Metric_Spaces|metric]] on the set, but as it turns out, requiring a metric is overly restrictive.  In fact, there are many equivalent ways to define what we will call a '''topological space''' just by defining families of subsets of a given set.  The properties of the topological space depend on the number of subsets and the ways in which these sets overlap.  Topological spaces can be fine or coarse, connected or disconnected, have few or many dimensions.

The most popular way to define a topological space is in terms of open sets, analogous to those of Euclidean Space.  (In Euclidean space, an open set is intuitively seen as a set that does not contain its &quot;boundary&quot;).

== Definition of a topological space ==
Given a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a '''topology''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (called '''open sets''') with the following properties:
*The empty set and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are both in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;.
*The union of any collection of open sets is an open set.  That is, &lt;math&gt;S_i \in \mathcal{T} \text{ for all } i \in I \implies \bigcup_{i \in I} S_i \in \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;.
*The intersection of any ''finite'' collection of open sets is an open set.  That is,  &lt;math&gt;A, B \in \mathcal{T} \implies A \cap B \in \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;.
The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''topological space'''. If the topology is clear or does not need an explicit name (since we can just refer to sets in the topology as open sets), then we just say that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a topological space.

== Examples of topological spaces ==
For any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there are two topologies we can always define on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:
* The '''''Discrete topology''''' - the topology consisting of all subsets of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* The '''''Indiscrete topology''''' (also known as the '''''trivial topology''''') - the topology consisting of just &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the empty set, &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
=== Metric Topology ===
Given a metric space &lt;math&gt; \ (X, d)\ &lt;/math&gt;, its &lt;b&gt;metric topology&lt;/b&gt; is the topology induced by using the set of all open balls as the base. One can also define the topology induced by the metric, as &lt;u&gt;the set of all open subsets defined by the metric&lt;/u&gt;.
We denote the topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; induced from the metric d with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T} = top(d)&lt;/math&gt;

This forms a topological space from a metric space.

If for a topological space &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt;, we can find a metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T} = top(d)&lt;/math&gt;, then the topological space is called [[w:Metrizable|metrizable]].

=== The usual topology on the real numbers ===
We can define a topology &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; by defining &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to be in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; if for every point &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt;, there is an &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)\subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;. We call this topology the '''standard topology''', or '''usual topology''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The cofinite topology on any set ===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty set. Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;  to be the collection of all subsets &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following:

# Either &lt;math&gt;G = \empty&lt;/math&gt; 
# Or &lt;math&gt;X \setminus G &lt;/math&gt; is finite.

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a topology on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; called '''the cofinite topology''' (or &quot;finite complement topology&quot;) on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Further, this topology turns out to be discrete if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is  finite.

=== The cocountable topology on any set ===

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty set. Define &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;  to be the collection of all subsets &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following:

# Either &lt;math&gt;G = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; 
# Or &lt;math&gt;X \setminus G &lt;/math&gt; is countable.

Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a topology on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; called '''the cocountable topology''' (or &quot;countable complement topology&quot;) on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Further, this topology turns out to be discrete if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is  countable.

== Sets in topological spaces ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. There are many types of sets we can define on &lt;math&gt;X.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[w:Complement_(set_theory)|complement]] of a set A in X, denoted by &lt;math&gt;A^C&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;A^C = X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the entire space except for A).
* A subset &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called '''closed''' if the set &lt;math&gt;C^C&lt;/math&gt; is open. Notice that the intersection of any non-zero number of closed sets is closed and the union of finitely many closed sets is closed. 
* Note also that a set can be both ''closed'' and ''open''. The trivial examples are the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and the entire set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, each of which is both closed and open. By definition, &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; is open, so its complement, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is closed. But &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, by definition, is an open set, so &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is both open and closed.
* A set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''neighborhood''' of a point &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if there is an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in U\subseteq N.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;We now investigate some commonly occurring sets in the study of Topology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
===Definition===
In a topological space, a [[w:G-delta|&lt;i&gt;&lt;math&gt;G_{\delta }&lt;/math&gt; set&lt;/i&gt;]] is a countable intersection of open sets. A &lt;i&gt;&lt;math&gt;F_{\sigma }&lt;/math&gt; set&lt;/i&gt; is a countable union of closed sets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Theorem===
The complement of a &lt;math&gt;F_{\sigma }&lt;/math&gt; set is &lt;math&gt;G_{\delta }&lt;/math&gt;,  and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Proof:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let A be a &lt;math&gt;F_{\sigma }&lt;/math&gt; set and let &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then A is a countable union of closed sets, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\limits_{n}^{{}}{A_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is closed for all n. Then &lt;math&gt;A^{c}=\bigcap\limits_{n}^{{}}{\left( A_{n} \right)^{c}}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;A_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;\left( A_{n} \right)^{c}&lt;/math&gt; is open, so we have a countable intersection of open sets. Hence &lt;math&gt;A^{c}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;G_{\delta }&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The entirely similar proof of the other implication is left to the reader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Theorem===
In any metric space, a closed set is a &lt;math&gt;G_{\delta }&lt;/math&gt; set.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proof:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Let X be a metric space and let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq (X,d)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Define &lt;math&gt;O_{n}=\bigcup\limits_{n}{\left\{ \beta_{1/n}(x)~\left| ~x\in A \right. \right\}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Observe that  &lt;math&gt;O_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is open for any n, and hence the union is open. 
Now our goal is to show that &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}=\bigcap\limits_{n}{O_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; to show that a closed set is the intersection of countably many open sets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\subseteq &lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;x\in \bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1/n}(x)&lt;/math&gt; intersects A at some &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; which implies &lt;math&gt;x\in \beta _{1/n}(x_{0})\subseteq O_{n}.&lt;/math&gt;. This is true for any n so &lt;math&gt;x\in \bigcap\limits_{n}{O_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\supseteq &lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;x\in \bigcap\limits_{n}{O_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\exists ~n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;x\in O_{n}\Rightarrow \exists ~x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; in A such that &lt;math&gt;x\in \beta _{1/n}(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;x\in \beta _{\varepsilon }(x_{0})&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;x\in \bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}=\bigcap\limits_{n}{O_{n}}&lt;/math&gt; and is a &lt;math&gt;G_{\delta }&lt;/math&gt; set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===Theorem===
In usual &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;F_{\sigma }&lt;/math&gt; set.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Proof:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual topology is a metric space, every singleton   such that &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. Thus, we have a countable union of closed sets, and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;F_{\sigma }&lt;/math&gt; set.

== Exercises ==
#Prove the following are topologies:
#*The discrete topology on any set.
#*The indiscrete topology on any set.
#*The cofinite topology on any set. 
#*The cocountable topology on any set.
#Show that the cofinite (respectively, cocountable) topology on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; equals the discrete topology if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite (respectively, countable).
#Prove that a set is open if and only if for every element within the set, there is a neighborhood contained within the set.&lt;br /&gt;
#Show that the discrete topology is the topology induced by the discrete metric. (This is also a splendid way of remembering the discrete and the indiscrete topology)

I propose that this page be merged with the solving equations page. [[User:Nfgdayton|Nfgdayton]] ([[User talk:Nfgdayton|talk]]) 17:18, 26 July 2010 (UTC)

== ==

The previous chapter [[Algebra/Arithmetic|Arithmetic]] has become quite long and this one, &quot;Simple symbolic manipulation,&quot; is shorter.  My suggestion is to cover the commutative, associative, distributive, and other fundamental laws of real numbers at the beginning of this chapter, especially since there are thoughts of covering a few extra topics (percentages, rounding, etc.) in &quot;Arithmetic&quot; as mentioned in comments at the bottom of its edit page.  Also, it would be a good idea to introduce sets briefly and discuss solution sets to single-variable equations equations in this chapter.  

There is a comment at the bottom of this chapter in the edit page about adding simultaneous equations to this chapter.  It will become long enough as it is.  I have started a new chapter on Simultaneous Equations in the second part of the book, &quot;Equations and Functions.&quot;  It comes right after the &quot;Function Graphing&quot; chapter, which I wrote.  Therefore, simultaneous equations will be able to be discussed using graphs in the new chapter.

== Incorrect expansion? ==

&quot;3x − 2 &gt; 2(x − 3). First, you may want to expand the right hand side: 3x − 2 &gt; 2x − 6&quot;

Quoted from the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algebra/Equations#Solving_Inequalities Solving Inequalities] section of the article.  Is that expansion true?  What if x = 4, for example?  That expansion assumed what, exactly, is applicable here?</text>

'''French Fries''' (or '''chips''') are a well-known element of fast food.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] ( potatoes with a high dry matter content, such as Russet or Maris Piper work best.)
*[[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
*Paper towels
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

#Peel potatoes
#Slice potatoes into thin straw-like pieces.
#Wash well with water to remove excess starch.
#Place fries in a pan with water and simmer or par boil on the stove for about 15 mins.
#Sieve and dry fries off.
#[[Cookbook:Deep fry|Deep fry]] at 175°C in vegetable oil, lard or dripping for 4 to 5 minutes to a light golden crisp. 
#Remove and place on plate with paper towels to absorb the leftover cooking oil.
#Transfer to another plate if necessary.
#Add salt and shake to ensure all French fries are evenly salted.

==Notes and tips==
*Vary the size of the potato slices.  Thick wedge shapes become Home Style Fries or English Style Chips, while thinly [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienned]] potatoes make for Shoestring Potatoes.  Cooking times will need to be adjusted.
*Try adding other [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] after cooking.  Minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] is popular in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California cuisine]]. 
*Instead of ketchup, serve with [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]], barbecue sauce, or [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], hummus, and [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]].
*For [[Cookbook:Poutine|poutine]], (a French-Canadian treat,) toss cooked fries with cheese curds and smother with [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]].

==Variations==
[[Image:fries cooking.jpg|thumb|250px|In the oil.]]
[[Image:Friescookingbigrest.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Prepared at a restaurant with thermostat temperature control. (The lack of bubbles in oil indicates an oil temperature of less than 120 °C)]]
Some cook them a single time in a generous amount of oil pre-heated to a temperature around 375&amp;nbsp;°F (190&amp;nbsp;°C) until they are golden and slightly crisp.  The method recommended by most cookbooks, and used by many restaurants, is to cook them in two stages: first at around 350&amp;nbsp;°F (177&amp;nbsp;°C), until the fries are nearly cooked but limp, still pale and not too dried; then, after they have been removed from the oil and allowed to cool, at a higher temperature, generally around 375&amp;nbsp;°F (190&amp;nbsp;°C), fries are fried again until they are golden and crisp, which normally takes less than a minute. A third method, attributed to the celebrated French chef Joël Robuchon for the home cook, is to put the sliced potatoes into a saucepan with just enough cold oil in it to cover the potatoes, then cook them over high heat until golden, stirring occasionally.&lt;ref name=steingarten1&gt;

A fourth method calls for blanching (but not over-cooking in water) the cut potatoes in boiling water before frying them.&lt;ref name=chg_whittington1&gt;

===Belgian method===
The Belgian way of cooking'' 'frites' ''is generally in two stages.
:First the peeled and lengthwise criss-cross cut potatoes are 'pre-fried' for about 7 to 12 minutes in oil or – traditionally – beef dripping preheated to about 130 to 186 °C (275°F-365°F) (medium-low to medium-high heat power dial settings depending on the amount of fries to oil and moisture removed by previous cooking time to allow the oil to cool), to cook the inner part without burning the outside, while some of the moisture is driven out and where the fragrance starts to develop. When the fries are added to the oil, the oil at first cools quickly (cooling depending on amount of fries and previous cooking time) and is quickly kept at secret values (98 °C to 122 °C for relatively long cooking times,  142 °C for three minutes for first cooking time) to prevent the potatoes from burning. The fries stay a pale beige to yellow color and not too dry when finished at this stage. The fries would not be burned with brown patches at this stage. Then they are taken out, tossed to avoid clumping, and generally allowed to cool down and dry for at least 30 minutes to make the fries more crispy and less greasy later. This intermediate product can be either frozen for 'instant' deep-frying later, or as several batches of 'pre-fried' fries prepared (e.g., when fries stands are opened for the day, or at home ahead of a company of guests) for rapid frying and almost simultaneously serving later.
:The second stage where the cooked flavour is achieved involves frying for about two to five minutes in oil or beef fat preheated to 175 to 195 °C (as high as the oil or fat can safely stand, but without burning the fries before this time period: a too high temperature breaks it down to rather poisonous compounds) depending on the initial temperature of the fries. The (cool) batches must be small enough relative to the quantity of oil or fat for its preheated temperature to stay sufficiently high (125 °C to 160 °C depending on moisture cooked out from previous cooking time) already during the first half minute of the frying process. Generally the cook is guided more by the colour of the product than by timing; and by experience with the particular variety of potato. As a rule-of-the-thumb, one might wait until the fries start to float near the surface. The oil temperature must reach specific values (115 °C to 125 °C for long cooking times, or 140 °C to 165 °C for short cooking times; 140 °C for 3.5 minutes initial cooking time) for a specific amount of time after the fries has been precooked. The cooking task is to get sufficient cooking time (7 to 16 minutes) without allowing the fries to become too greasy. Can avoid the fries from becoming too greasy by cooking it at high oil temperatures at the start of the pre-cooking; once this stage has been achieved, the fries will not get much greasier when cooking for longer times later. Cool and dry the fries for at least 25 minutes to make it more crispy later. Cooling the fries may help precipitate the oil making it less greasy later. Once more the fries are sturdily tossed and preferably also kind of centrifuged (vigorously swerving the batch around in a wide recipient, in the shape of the base of a cone upside down, held in front of the cook's belly – common for professional batch frying), and shortly tossed again – thus removing excessive fattiness and preventing loss of the outer crispness.
:Ideally, the fries have a golden to golden-brown appearance and a bite through the crispy outside reveals a soft inside. For a given depth of the crispy crust, the balance with the soft cooked potato inside is determined by the thickness; no less than 13 [[Cookbook:Millimetre|mm]] traditionally to 10&amp;nbsp;mm towards the end of the 20th century, before frying, are typical for Belgium. Some restaurants may cut as thin as 5&amp;nbsp;mm. In a good professional ''friterie'' stand, the cut is done in a single action by driving the whole peeled potato standing vertically, through a horizontal ''raster'' of crosswise sharp blades. This easily removable (for cleaning) and exchangeable set of blades defines the thickness of the ''frites''. Some potatoes like Bintjes or Russet potatoes can produce a fried fish, beefy and pastry like fragrance after being fried for a specific amount of time (over 10 minutes) above a specific temperature (118 °C).

==Safety==
''Do not attempt to extinguish fat fires with water!'']]
* If the oil becomes too hot, it may catch fire. '''Do not attempt to extinguish it with water''', as this &lt;u&gt;will&lt;/u&gt; cause an explosive reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Polyalphabetic substitution cipher''' is simply a [[../Substitution cipher|substitution cipher]] with an alphabet that changes. For example one could have two alphabets:

 Plain Alphabet:     A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 Cipher Alphabet #1: B D F H J L N P R T V X Z A C E G I K M O Q S U W Y
 Cipher Alphabet #2: Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A

Now to encrypt the message ``The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; we would alternate between the two cipher alphabets, using #1 for every first letter and #2 for every second, to get: ``Msj joxfp dicda ucu tfzkjw  ceji msj xzyb hln&quot;.

Polyalphabetic substitution ciphers are useful because the are less easily broken by [[../Frequency analysis|frequency analysis]], however if an attacker knows for instance that the message has a period n, then he simply can individually frequency analyze each cipher alphabet.  

The number of letters encrypted before a polyalphabetic substitution cipher returns to its first cipher alphabet is called its '''period'''. The larger the period, the stronger the cipher. Of course, this method of encryption is certainly not secure by any definition and should not be applied to any real-life scenarios.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of key '''Objective-C''' concepts that have close relations to the practice of object-oriented programming in general. For the moment, we won't look at exact syntax until later.

: ''If you have previous experience in object-oriented programming, you may wish to skip these sections and examine the Summary section''

== Objective-C is just C (a superset of C) , with Lisp like object-oriented syntax ==
object-orientation in objective-C has some similiarities with C++ ,  and is a way of organising memory like c-style structs, except that it is expected that the structures have pointers to functions that can reference any offset defined as an instance variable or function pointer , so the object is a memory location from which the offsets to instance variables can be found , and where there is a pointer back to the class definition that gives the addresses of functions of the class. 

In C++, to call a member function from a member function of a class, the syntax is 
 this -&gt; func ( a, b ); 

or 

 (*this).func (a, b);

this represents a pointer to &quot;this&quot; object , the instance of a class which defined the function where &quot;this&quot; is being used .

In objective-C , 'self' is the keyword to replace 'this', and the invocation would be
 [self  func: a, b ] 

So here, the parameters to the function are not enclosed in parentheses like most other c based languages, but 

Constructors in java are called like this in a constructor of a child class, when
the parent class's constructor needs to be invoked .

  Child( a, b, c ) {   super(a); this.b = b; this.c = c;  }

Similarly, in objective-C , for a class interface 
  @interface MyClass : MyParentClass {
    MyClassB * b;
    int  c;
  }
  @property (copy, nonatomic) NSInteger  d;

  -(void) func1;
  -(void) func2: (int)param1, (id) param2;
 
  @end

there is an elided init constructor function, and

the constructor might be

 - (id) init: (id)a, (id) b, (int) c , (NSInteger) d {  
    self = [super init:a ];  // -(2)
    if (self) { 
     _b = [[B alloc] initByCopy:b] ;
     _c = c; 
     self.d = d;
    }
    return self;
   }  

and there exists a constructor for MyParentClass , which is

 - (id) init: (id) a  // - (2a)
 { .. }

The above example shows:
# &lt;b&gt;id&lt;/b&gt; is a placeholder for a class type.
# In a function declaration or definition, parentheses are conventionally put around the return type, and before each parameter to give their types.
# self is a supplied instance variable that references an object of the class, but can be initially an object of the supertype  , as in (2) and (2a). 
# the convention is to call alloc which is a class function for a class to obtain an object, and then to initialize the object by calling an object function with a function conventionally being 'init' or beginning with 'init..'  , so the pattern is '''my_object = [[A_Class alloc] init:a_param1, a_param2]''', which means &quot;allocate the memory for an object templated by A_Class, and then call init on the object with a_param1 and a_param2&quot;.  
# some simple C language types such as int, double, char* , can be represented by more complex classes beginning with NS.
# In the above example, _b and _c don't have self preceding it , but d does. d is defined as a property in the interface declaration part of the class. A property has '''elided''' set/get functions for the instance variable, and can have property attributes like ( copy, nonatomic ) - copy means &quot;self.d = d&quot; is short for &quot;self.d = [ [NSInteger alloc] initByCopy:d ] , where NSInteger is the class for d.
# it's helpful to remember that objective-C is an extension of c, and variable names usually refer to a short sequence of 4, 8 or 16 bytes , which either represent numbers (int, long, float, double, char) or addresses ( char* , class instance pointers ). This is a bit unlike java, where variables are references to objects, and it is elided or hidden how the objects are referenced, and how their memory is managed. Objective-c frameworks added in reference-counting automatic deallocating memory management later to the NS.. classes family.
=== C and Standard Unix system interface underlie Objective C ===
Any of the standard Unix libraries which are available in C are available in
Objective C , so this includes standard system interfaces to services such as
file input/output, dynamic ( malloc/free ) allocation, string functions, maths functions, process creation, synchronization, and interprocess communication via file locks, thread locks, thread condition variables, semaphores, pipes, sockets, shared memory management, signals. However, objective C allows grouping of data structures with methods, and gives rise to shortcut organizing structured programming for domains such as GUI construction, using object-oriented patterns such as polymorphism and delegation ( via objective-c &quot;protocol&quot; feature ). Additional features also include automated references counting so that dynamic allocated objects are automatically deallocated without garbage collection. This gives rise to replacement of standard operating system interface functions (malloc/free) , with standard objective c. object oriented idioms from NSObject e.g. 
 NS&lt;some class&gt;* p = [[NS&lt;some class&gt; alloc] init] ; 
for those familiar to dot only syntax eg java , means same as  
 MYClass p = (MyClass.alloc()).init();
&quot;Call static factory class method alloc(), and invoke init() on object.&quot;

In c, there is only 
  MyStruct * p = malloc ( size of(MyStruct));
later on, the pointer p may share the memory address with another pointer, say q, 
and there would be 2 references, then if later, q = z, and even later p= z, but
wait, there is a memory leak, so free() must be called on p because it is the last
reference to the memory allocation produced by the call to malloc above.
  free(p);
In older objective c frameworks,
  [p dealloc];
However, automatic reference counting or ARC, means that when p = z, in the example above,
the reference count for the NS object pointed to by p falls to zero, and free() is called on
the hidden pointer held by the ARC support framework.

Example 2,  instead of
 char * charbuf[maxlength]; 
 snprintf ( charbuf, maxlength-1, &quot;hello %s , %d times!&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, 2);

there is

 NSString* mystrbuf = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat: &quot;hello %s , %d times!&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, 2];

== What is object-oriented programming? ==
Object-oriented programming (often just shortened to OO or OOP), is a programming paradigm where code is written in units called classes, where functions associated with  data structures are declared and defined together.  For example, ANSI C has data in &lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt;s, and similarly, an OO language stores data in classes or objects, but also declares the functions that operate on instances of structured data (objects). A class itself can be an object, with associated data and class functions, but there is only one instance per process space. (in general, operating systems have one process per running program, but allow multiprocess programs which are programs that start off other programs ).

For example, if you are creating a word processor, you might represent the document by an object that has text as its data, and associate with it different tasks to perform upon the document's data, such as &quot;spell check&quot;. 

The word processor then would be a small program that might draw the window and show the document's text.  A spell check button  would perform the &quot;spell check&quot; task upon that document's object.

However, if we were editing two documents at once, they would differ probably in the contents of the documents- the data. But all the documents would be more or less the same: Each document contains a space for its text, and has a couple of defined tasks that operate on the text. Each document object has essentially the same form. We call this form the ''class'' of the object, and we often give it a name. Let's call the document class &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; (Style note: we often capitalize names of classes).

Now, each document object has the form of the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;. We say that each document object is an ''instance'' of &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;. So, for example, our word processor operates on ''instances'' of the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; class. Sometimes we may call an instance of the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; class just &quot;a &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

Remember that each object has some data. For example, with the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; class, each &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; has data to hold the text of the document. We call the data that each object holds ''instance variables''. So, a &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; may specify an instance variable to hold the text, or an instance variable to hold the word count, or the author, or any other data we may want to specify.  Each &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; has instance variables that are separate from the instance variables of any other &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; that may exist.

Each object also has a number of tasks that it can perform on its instance variables. In Objective-C, we call these tasks ''methods''. The object's methods operate on the object's instance variables.

However, there's more to objects than just this. With Objective-C, we can do a lot of interesting things with objects.

== Working with objects ==
Let's stick with the example of our word processor. Say we want to create a new instance of &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; so we can work with it. This process is called ''instantiation''. 

Now that we have an active instance of an object, we can work with it, by using the object's methods. We'll look at defining and working with methods later. Each method merely acts like a function in C, and in Objective-C, there is only a minor syntax change. 

When we're completely done with the object and want to get rid of it (so it stops taking up memory), we do what is known as ''destruction'' or ''deallocation'' of the object. This is like &lt;tt&gt;free&lt;/tt&gt;'ing a &lt;tt&gt;malloc&lt;/tt&gt;'d array, for example, in C. However, if, in the process of using the object's methods, we allocate some extra memory for its instance variables, we must free that memory too.

== Object techniques ==
When we're creating new classes, we may want to base the new object's behaviour on a class, which we have previously created. For example, if we want to create a document class that has details of style information, we may wish to base that class on the `Document` class, which we have previously created. 

This is a common enough feature that it is included in object-oriented systems, and it is given the name of ''inheritance''.  When a class inherits from another, the new class takes on the form of the old class ''and'' can add extra instance variables and methods. 

So, if we wanted to create a `StyledDocument` class, we would inherit from the `Document` class.  In Objective-C, a class only inherits from one other class. This is known as ''single inheritance''.

== Interfaces and implementation ==
As in the real world, there is a separation between how objects ''are used'', and how objects ''work''. For example, with our word processor, there is a consistent ''interface'' to the spellchecker (how it is used), such as buttons to jump to the next misspelt word, to go back, and to correct.  But, behind the scenes, the way the spellchecker works (the ''implementation'') can be done in many different ways. 

In Objective-C, the ''interface'' and ''implementation'' are kept separate. This allows different objects to work and link together in a well-defined manner. To change channels on your television, for example, you use the interface of the buttons on the television set instead of opening it and fiddling around with the electronics.

Keeping the implementation separate from the interface means that we can change anything in the implementation (even substituting it with another implementation) and everything should still work, because objects (buttons etc) interact with each other only through their interfaces.

== Summary ==
So, before we get to learning Objective-C syntax, let's recap:
: An ''object'' is an ''instance'' of a ''class''
:: which has defined upon it tasks known as ''methods'' 
::: and data known as ''instance variables''
: A ''class'' can ''inherit'' from one (and only one) other ''class'' (''single inheritance'')

:'''Demuestre''':


1. &lt;math&gt;a.0=0.a=0&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Demostración''':

Por hipótesis decimos que,

:&lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;

Por existencia de neutros, podemos sumar un &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;a.0&lt;/math&gt;  y sigue siendo &lt;math&gt;a.0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a.0+0=a.0&lt;/math&gt;

Con el fin de aplicar propiedad transitiva, buscamos una ecuación que sea igual a &lt;math&gt;a.0&lt;/math&gt;,(esta será demostrada mas adelante),

:&lt;math&gt;a.0+a.0=a.0&lt;/math&gt;  (*)

Al conocer que ambas ecuaciones son iguales a &lt;math&gt;a.0&lt;/math&gt;,se igualan por propiedad transitiva  

:&lt;math&gt;a.0+0=a.0+a.0&lt;/math&gt;

Por el teorema: si a+c=a+b, entonces c=b; podemos cancelar &lt;math&gt;a.0&lt;/math&gt; en ambos lados.

:&lt;math&gt;a.0=0&lt;/math&gt;


:(*) &lt;math&gt;a.0+a.0=a.0&lt;/math&gt;

Por existencia de neutros para la suma, decimos que 

:&lt;math&gt;a.0+a.0=a.(0+0)&lt;/math&gt;

Por existencia neutros, decimos que &lt;math&gt;0+0=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a.0+a.0=a.0&lt;/math&gt;  

:QED

2. &lt;math&gt;(-a)b=-(ab)&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Demostración''':

Por hipótesis decimos que,

:&lt;math&gt;a,b\in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;  

Por existencia de inversos para la suma podemos decir que

:&lt;math&gt;ab+(-ab)=0&lt;/math&gt;  

Con el fin de aplicar propiedad transitiva, buscamos una ecuación que sea igual a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, (esta será demostrada mas adelante),

:&lt;math&gt;ab+(-a)b=0&lt;/math&gt;  (*)

Al conocer que ambas ecuaciones son iguales a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, se igualan por propiedad transitiva

:&lt;math&gt;ab+(-ab)=ab+(-a)b&lt;/math&gt;  

Por el teorema: si a+c=a+b, entonces c=b; podemos cancelar 
&lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; en ambos lados.

:&lt;math&gt;-(ab)=(-a)b&lt;/math&gt;  



:(*) &lt;math&gt;ab+(-a)b=0&lt;/math&gt;

Por propiedad distributiva podemos expresar la igualdad como

:&lt;math&gt;ab+(-a)b=[a+(-a)]b&lt;/math&gt;  

Por existencia de inverso para la suma decimos que, 

:&lt;math&gt;ab+(-a)b=[0]b&lt;/math&gt;  

Por Teorema &lt;math&gt;a.0=0.a=0&lt;/math&gt;, tenemos que

:&lt;math&gt;ab+(-a)b=0&lt;/math&gt;

:QED

3. &lt;math&gt;(a/b)+(c/d)=[(ad+bc)/bd]&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Demostración''':

Por hipótesis decimos que,

:&lt;math&gt;a,c\in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;  

y

:&lt;math&gt;b,d\in \mathbb R - (0)&lt;/math&gt;  

Como solo se trabaja con suma y multiplicación, por notación cambiamos la expresión de la igualdad 

:&lt;math&gt;(a/b)+(c/d)=(ab^-1)+(cd^-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Por existencia de neutros para la multiplicación, podemos  multiplicar  la expresión por &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Este &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; se puede expresar de la forma &lt;math&gt;(bd)(bd)^-1.

:&lt;math&gt;(ab^-1)+(cd^-1)=[(ab^-1)+(cd^-1)](bd)(bd)^-1&lt;/math&gt; 

Por propiedad distributiva tenemos que

:&lt;math&gt;(ab^-1)+(cd^-1)=[(ab^-1)(bd)+(cd^-1)(bd)](bd)^-1&lt;/math&gt; 

Por las propiedades: conmutativa, asociativa y existencia del reciproco, tenemos que

:&lt;math&gt;(a/b)+(c/d)=[(ad)+(bc)](ba^-1)&lt;/math&gt; 

Para que la igualdad sea como la presentada en el enunciado, por notación le cambiamos la expresión a

4. &lt;math&gt;-0=0/(bc)&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Demostración''':

Por hipótesis decimos que,

:&lt;math&gt;0\in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;  

y

:&lt;math&gt;-0\in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;  

Por existencia de inverso para la suma tenemos que

Por existencia de neutros para la suma tenemos que

:&lt;math&gt;0+0=0&lt;/math&gt; 

Al conocer que ambas ecuaciones son iguales a &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, se igualan por propiedad transitiva

:&lt;math&gt;0+(-0)=0+0&lt;/math&gt;

Como solo se trabaja con suma y multiplicación, por notación cambiamos la expresión de la igualdad

3.Los ejes mayor y menor de una elipse aumentan sus longitudes a las velocidades respectivas de 1cm/seg, y 2cm/seg.  A qué rata crece su área cuando el eje mayor mide 10 cm y el eje menor 6 cm?.   
(Área de una elipse: S=&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;ab siendo a y b las semi-longitudes de sus ejes).

Sean a,b los ejes mayor y menor de la elipse, entonces el área de la elipse S es:

:S=&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;ab

:dS/dt=&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;b(da/dt)+&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;a(db/dt)

Pero 		

:da/dt =&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;center&gt;db/dt =&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;.

Entonces

:dS/dt=pb+&lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;a=&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;(6)+&lt;math&gt;2\pi(10) &lt;/math&gt;  =&lt;math&gt;26\pi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;cm^2&lt;/math&gt;/seg)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Meta-discussion: (about the wiki page itself, not the content).

This is my first attempt at moving content from the interlinear to this wikibook.  I have some experience with wikis but little with this particular variety.  Some of the links gave me trouble, in particular the image links.  From my reading of the help document it shouldn't be treating these image links specially, but obviously it is.  The one inserts the image directly into the page which may have copyright issues, the other two links don't seem to work and so the wiki replaces what would in theory by the image with simply the filename.  I don't know how to protect these so that they are treated as mere links like the others.

== Description: ==

One plant centered on page.

: Root: left-right symmetrical, planar, looking sort of like headless stick man with outstretched arms and gripping hands. Overpainted with dark color.

: Stem: short and thin.

: Branches: two main ones, almost upright, slightly bent. Irregular thickness, awkward shape (cf. top right leaf). Light-clored with a dark vein grossly painted along the middle.

: Leaves: Dark overpaint, shaped like a triangular fan with five lanceolated fingers.

: Stalk: medium length, looks like a branch.

: Flowers: three, on tip of main branch.

: Stalk: longish, looks like a branch.

: Chalyx: an oblong oval swelling at end of stalk, partial dark overpaint.

: Petals: many, narrow and long; the flower looks like a shaving brush.

: Core: hidden by petals.

Two paragraphs (with 6.4 and 5.4 lines), left- and right-justified: one at the top, slightly narrower, interrupted by three flowers; and one near the bottom, interrupted by two branches.

== Comments: ==

The root looks rather strange, the stems and leaves are somewhat awkward, but the flowers look normal.

Petersen tentative identification is &quot;cyanus segetum, cornflower (caeruleus) (cf 153)&quot;. That must be

'''Centaurea_cyanus (cornflower,fiodaliso;bluet,kornblume)'''

http://www.runeberg.org/nordflor/7.html

The flower shape and branching pattern seem to match fairly well. However, those features are not very specific. [What about color?] Also, the leaves of Centaurea cyanus are long and thin, with smooth edges or a few very shallow teeth, attached directly to the stem; quite unlike those of [[f2r]].

Infusions of Centaurea cyanus were once used as a febrifugue (whole plant) and eye wash (flowers only).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bubble Sort ==
The '''bubble sort''' is also known as the ''ripple'' sort. The bubble sort is probably the first, reasonably complex module that any beginning programmer has to write. It is a very simple construct which introduces the student to the fundamentals of how sorting works.

A bubble sort makes use of an [[w:Array|array]] and some sort of &quot;swapping&quot; mechanism. Most programming languages have a built-in function to swap elements of an array. Even if a swapping function does not exist, only a couple of extra lines of code are required to store one array element in a temporary field in order to swap a second element into its place. Then the first element is moved out of the temporary field and back into the array at the second element's position.

Here is a simple example of how a bubble sort works: Suppose you have a row of children's toy blocks with letters on them. They are in random order and you wish to arrange them in alphabetical order from left to right.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Step 1. Begin with the first block.  In this case, the letter '''G'''. (Fig. 1.)

&lt;center&gt;[[image:bubble01.png|Fig. 1]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 1''&lt;/center&gt;

:Step 2. Look at the block just to the right of it.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Step 3. If the block to the right should come before the block on the left, swap them so that they are in order (Fig. 2.)

&lt;center&gt;[[image:bubble02.png|Fig. 2]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 2''&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:If you were doing this by hand, you might just pick the blocks to be moved with one in each hand and cross your arms to swap them. Or you might move the first one out of its position temporarily, move the second one in its place, then move the first one to the now empty position (this is the difference between having a single function to do the swap, or writing some code to do it).

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Step 4. Compare the next block in line with the first, and repeat step 3. Do this until you run out of blocks. Then begin step one again with the second block. (Fig. 3,4,5,6)


&lt;center&gt;[[image:bubble03.png|Fig. 3]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 3 - Pass #2''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[image:bubble04.png|Fig. 4]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 4 - Pass #3''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[image:bubble05.png|Fig. 5]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 5 - Pass #4''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[image:bubble06.png|Fig. 6]]&lt;br&gt;''Fig. 6 - Completed Sort''&lt;/center&gt;

===Why is it called a bubble sort?===

The bubble sort gets its name because elements tend to move up into the correct order like bubbles rising to the surface.

=== Quick Basic ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;qbasic&quot;&gt;
CLS

DIM NameArray$(1000)

i = 0

' Seed read ...
READ Name$

' Loop through and read names in data ...
DO WHILE Name$ &lt;&gt; &quot;*EOD&quot;
      i = i + 1
      NameArray$(i) = Name$
      READ Name$
LOOP

' The value of i is now the number of names in the array ...
ArraySize = i


' Bubble (or ripple) sort ...
FOR i = 1 TO ArraySize - 1
  FOR j = 1 TO ArraySize - 1
      IF NameArray$(j) &gt; NameArray$(j + 1) THEN
         SWAP NameArray$(j), NameArray$(j + 1)
      END IF
  NEXT j
NEXT i

' Print out the sorted results ...
FOR i = 1 TO ArraySize
        PRINT NameArray$(i)
NEXT i

&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void BubbleSort (int a[], int length)
{
	int i, j, temp;
	
    for (i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
    {
        for (j = 0; j &lt; length - 1; j++)
        {
            if (a[j + 1] &lt; a[j])
            {
                temp = a[j];
                a[j] = a[j + 1];
                a[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

(*=================================================================================== 

 BubbleSort is an all purpose sorting procedure that is passed an array of
 integers and returns that same array with the array elements sorted as desired.
 
 Parameters are used to control the sorting operation:
 
 If you want to sort the entire array, pass a value in Count that signals the number
 of elements you want sorted. BubbleSort will then sort Count number of elements starting 
 with the first element in the array. 
 
 If you want to sort a subset of elements within the array, pass 0 in Count and pass
 a beginning and ending subset index number in First and Last, respectively.
 
 The sort will be either ascending or descending as controlled by the parameter Ascend:
 
 Pass True in Ascend and the sort will be ascending. Pass False and the sort will be 
 descending.
 
 Data: The array to be sorted.
 
 NOTE: Sample is a var and will be modified by BubbleSort, unless the array is 
 already in a sorted state.
 
 Count:  0 _or_ the number of elements to be sorted, starting with the first element.
 
 First:  The first element to be sorted in a subset of the array.
 
 Last:   The last element to be sorted in a subset of the array.
 
 Ascend:  Flag to indicate the sort order. True is ascending order. False is descending.
 
 Succ:   Flag returns result of BubbleSort
 
 0 = success.
 
 1 = Failed. Parameter First has value below allowed first index value.
 
 2 = Failed. Parameter Last has value above allowed last index value.
 
 3 = Failed. Parameter Last has value below allowed first index value.

If you are dealing with a large volume of data, use the COBOL SORT using sequential files.
For sorting a WORKING STORAGE table, the following example assumes that the table is already loaded. The literals &quot;''a''&quot; indicates the size of the row, and &quot;''b''&quot; how many rows in the table.

== Maximos y minimos==  

1.La función y = f(x)/x tiene valor extremo en Saa. Demostrar que la recta tangente a la curva y = f(x)en x = a  pasa por el origen.

:Y = f(x)/x,

:Dy/dx = f’ (x) x – f’ (x)/x2

Entonces tenemos 

:f’(a)a=f(a)             &lt;center&gt;(1)&lt;/center&gt;

La ecuación de la recta tangente a la curva   y=f(x) en (a, f(a)) es:

:y–f(a)=f’(a)(x-a)             &lt;center&gt;(2)&lt;/center&gt;

Reemplazando la condición (1) en (2):

:y–f(a)=f’(a)[x–f(a)]

O sea       	

:y = f’(a)(x),

ésta pasa por el origen.



2. Hallar el máximo y el mínimo de 3x + 4y cuando x2 + y2 = 1,

Sea S = 3x + 4y donde  x2 + y2 = 1      &lt;center&gt;(x ³ 0, y ³ 0)&lt;/center&gt;

En los puntos críticos tenemos:

:dS/dx=3+4(y’)=0

:2x+2y(y’)=0
  
:&lt;math&gt;4x=3y&lt;/math&gt;

entonces:

:&lt;math&gt;x = 3/5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = 4/5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S = 5&lt;/math&gt;

En los extremos los valores de S son:

:&lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;S = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;S = 3&lt;/math&gt;

Por lo tanto:

Máximo de S = 5, Mínimo de S = 3


3.Pruebe que la distancia mínima al eje OX del punto máximo o mínimo de la curva y = ax2+bx+c se obtiene sí b2–4ac=0.

El punto máximo (o mínimo) de la curva y=ax2 +bx+c esta en 

:&lt;math&gt;x=-b/2a&lt;/math&gt;,   :&lt;math&gt;y=-b+4ac/4a&lt;/math&gt; 

La distancia del punto al eje OX es:

:D=|-b^2+4ac/4a|

Entonces D es mínimo cuando b–4ac=0

:y = f’(a)(x),

ésta pasa por el origen.
 

== Razón de cambio== 

1.Sean OA, OB y OC tres aristas mutuamente perpendiculares de un paralelepípedo. Si OA crece &lt;math&gt;1cm&lt;/math&gt;/seg, OB crece &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;cm/seg y OC decrece 3&lt;/math&gt;cm/seg. Diga con qué rata varía el volumen del sólido cuando OA=&lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;cm, OB=&lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;cm, OC=&lt;math&gt;12&lt;/math&gt;cm?

Sean x=OA,y=OB,z=OC,entonces por hipótesis:

:dx/dt=&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;(cm/seg),dy/dt=&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;(cm/seg),dz/dt=&lt;math&gt;
-3&lt;/math&gt;(cm/seg),

Sea V el volumen del paralelepípedo entonces

:dV/dt=(dx/dt)(yz)+(xz)(dy/dt)+(x)(y)(dz/dt)

Si x=&lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;,y=&lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;,z=&lt;math&gt;12&lt;/math&gt; entonces

:dV/dt=&lt;math&gt;(1)(8)(12)&lt;/math&gt;+&lt;math&gt;2(10)(12)&lt;/math&gt;+&lt;math&gt;(-3)(10)(8) &lt;/math&gt;

:= &lt;math&gt;96&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;cm^3&lt;/math&gt;/seg).


2.La altura y el radio de un cilindro circular recto aumentan a las velocidades de a cm/seg y b cm/seg.  ¿Cuáles son las ratas de crecimiento de su volumen y su superficie total?
Sean V, S el volumen y la superficie del cilindro de radio r y altura h, entonces

:V =&lt;math&gt;\pi r2 &lt;/math&gt;h &lt;center&gt;S =&lt;math&gt;2 \pi r2+2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;r h&lt;/center&gt;

entonces

:dV/dt=&lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;r h(dr/dt)+&lt;math&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;h(dh/dt)

:dS/dt =&lt;math&gt;4 \pi&lt;/math&gt;r(dr/dt)+&lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;h(dr/dt)+&lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;r(dh/dt)

Pero como dh/dt=a, dr/dt=b entonces tenemos

:dV/dt=&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;r(&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;h b+r a)

:dS/dt=&lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;r b+h b+r a)



3.Sea f(x) derivable en &lt;math&gt;x &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, y f(0)= &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, si f ’(x) es creciente en &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; entonces demuestre que g(x)=F(x)/x es también creciente en &lt;math&gt;x &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

:g’(x)=[f’(x)(x)–f(x)]/&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;

:f‘(x)(x)–f(x)=f‘(x)(x)–[f(x)–f(0)]

:=f‘(x)x–f(c)(x–&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;)	&lt;center&gt;(&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;c&lt;x)&lt;/center&gt;

:=x(f‘(x)–f‘(c))≥&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;	&lt;center&gt;(f‘ es creciente)&lt;/center&gt;

entonces 

:g’(x)≥ &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; para todo x&gt;&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]

'''Fried eggs''', a popular breakfast dish in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, take about 5 minutes to prepare.  They are often served with toast or with other fried dishes.

==Ingredients==
*2 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (or [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]])
*2 or 3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], depending on appetite
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste (optional)

==Equipment==
*A small (10&quot;) [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]]
*A [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] 
*Gas ring, at medium heat

==Procedure==  
[[Image:Fried egg, sunny side up.jpg|thumb|right|Sunny Side Up fried egg]]
#Melt the butter in the pan over low to medium heat.
#Crack open the eggs into the pan and let fry until the yolks begin to harden at the edges (indicated by a lightening in the yolk color). 
#Using the spatula, flip the eggs over and allow to cook ten seconds for over-easy, thirty seconds for over-medium, or up to one minute for over-hard. 
#Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*It often considered a cardinal sin to allow the yolk of an egg to break (although some prefer fried eggs with broken yolks). If the cook ensures that the eggs are fresh the yolks will be more 'pert', and less liable to break. 
*For ''Sunnyside Up'', do not flip the eggs.  Use a slightly lower heat, and cover the pan with a lid for some of the cooking period.  An ideal sunnyside up has a runny yolk, but the white should be cooked. 
*Uncooked egg white (often called jelly) is normally unwanted and less-preferred than a partially cooked yolk, so err on the side of overcooking rather than undercooking the eggs.  
*For a richer taste, try sprinkling with grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or freshly chopped [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] and [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]].
*When frying eggs for [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]], [[Cookbook:Rolls|rolls]] or [[Cookbook:Wrap|wraps]], it is often a good idea to break the yolks. This increases the coverage of yolk so that every bite gets some yolk, and prevents uncooked yolk dripping out.

==Olive Oil Fried Eggs==
#Heat 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil over a low-medium heat (you will break the olive oil if you heat it too much).
#Crack open one egg into the pan and let fry while splashing some hot oil on the yolk so as to cook the top, if the egg begins to bubble, lower the heat.
#DO NOT FLIP THE EGG, it will cook with the hot oil you are splashing on it. 
#Serve, add salt and pepper to taste. 
Ideally you will get a chunk of feta cheese, place next to eggs and pour the remaining hot oil on the cheese not only softening the cheese but basting and cooking at the same time, the smell is incredible and the taste is old world. Heat some bread and use it to soak up the oil... AMAZING!

==Dirty Desert Fried Eggs==
#Using butter to oil the pan and put heat to a medium
#Crack two eggs onto the pan and immediately garnish the whites with onion or garlic powder, whichever you have available feel free to use a lot because it only helps the taste, just don't dump it on put the heat down to low
#Sprinkle salt mainly in the yolks, and spread a little over the whites
#Add a small bit of black pepper over the eggs to your liking
#Put a lid on the pan and check occasionally
#When the whites are no longer runny on top they are ready and delicious
goes especially well with a piece of toast or two because the yolk is still pretty runny and very flavorsome!

==Fried Bacon and Egg Sandwich (Homemade Egg McMuffin)==
This recipe makes two sandwiches.  The eggs are better over hard with the yolks broken so you don't get yolk dribbling down your arm while eating.
#Put on a pot of coffee.
#Get your English muffins ready to toast.  If you have a toaster oven or broiler, you can put some cheese on to get bubbly.  Don't set it going yet...
#Heat a medium pan over medium heat, fry 4 strips of bacon in one layer turning often until browned and crispy to your taste.  Lower the heat if the bacon fat starts to spatter.
#Remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towel, pat the bacon with another sheet of paper towel to remove some of the fat
#Pour most of the fat into a teacup, leaving most of the brown bits in the pan.
#Wash the pan to remove the brown bits, dry the pan and put the pan back on the heat.
#Pour about a tablespoon of the bacon fat back into the pan.
#Take your used paper towels and ball them up, put them in the teacup with the bacon fat.  (When you are done eating the fat will have soaked into the towels, so you don't have to pour the fat down the drain, or scoop out congealed fat from the cup.)
#Crack open two eggs into the pan, add salt and pepper and fry for about 2 minutes, put the toast going and they will be done at about the same time.
#Break the yolks, spreading them over the whites, and flip the eggs.  Fry for another minute.
#Assemble your sandwiches and eat.  Now isn't that better than going to a fast food joint?

==Warnings==
*Many people prefer their eggs only partially cooked.  Please see ''[[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]]'' for possible health concerns of eating raw eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary==
Learn to be cognizant of words that you do not yet understand.  Cognizant means to be consciously informed.

It is generally known that it is easier to learn something which you want to learn. When do we want to learn? One situation when we usually want to learn is when we have to in order to solve a concrete problem. This leads to the concept of ''information availability''. If you have access to information when you need it, you will learn more. For instance, if you need to understand a word and have a handheld computer with a dictionary, you will probably look it up. If you haven't any dictionary available, and the need of knowing the word cease to exist, you never learn the word.

We also learn when we are curious. If you can access the information you need, again maybe using a handheld computer, you can learn while you are curious. Later in the day you might feel that other things are more important.
==Metaphor==
According to some cognitive scientists, notably [[w:George Lakoff|George Lakoff]], most abstract concepts are founded on [[w:metaphor|metaphor]].  The [[w:number line|number line]] represents quantity as distance, for example, and the [[w:Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate system]] generalizes that same metaphor to function in two dimensions.  [[w:René Descartes|René Descartes]] did not invent this metaphor: people from many cultures say &quot;the price went up&quot; (or the equivalent), regardless of their native language.  The metaphor &quot;more IS up&quot; (in Lakoff's notation) is quite old, but Descartes did formalize and extend it, allowing it to be applied to a new array of intricate concepts.

But a metaphor can only be extended by a certain amount, after which it loses its meaning.  Much of the power of mathematics comes from systematic and well-documented limits to the application of its metaphors.  As soon as a new metaphor is added to the field, mathematicians thoroghly test exactly where it does and does not apply, and record their results explicitly in theorems that guide future work.

The convention in other fields is to give metaphors much less explicit limits, forcing the reader or listener to find them out by trial and error.  Returning to the &quot;more IS up&quot; example, some quantities tend to go up only with difficulty but go down quite easily, or vice-versa.  In these cases, your intuitive understanding of gravity can be added to the metaphor, if you imagine that some quantities sink, while others float.  If this doesn't apply, then the metaphorical &quot;weight&quot; of a quantity won't help your understanding.  

Some teachers are cognizant of the role that metaphor plays in learning, but in many courses, the metaphors behind the concepts presented are only vaguely hinted at.  Actively searching for them and thoroughly testing their limits as early as possible can be quite helpful.

Couldn't dating be a seperate book?
(And have a link in the &quot;getting a girl&quot; book to the dating book.)

Because dating is a much broader category than getting a girl.

For example, my situation. I have a girl, we met thru coincidence and it clicked, neither of us were searching for a boy/girl-friend.
So I have no need for the &quot;getting a girl&quot; book.
However info on dating in general is handy in my situation.
And there are dozens of other people that could benefit from good dating ideas that aren't intersted in &quot;getting a girl&quot;.
I also have some good dating idea's, but I won't add them to the &quot;getting a girl book&quot; because I am opposed to the ethics behind this book.
However I would love to share my idea's with other people who are searching for a good idea for a date.

My proposel is a Dating book, or more precisely a &quot;Going out for two book&quot;.
With Dating idea's and little tips. Interesting idea's to have a good time for lovers.

::I agree. Please sign you comments. [[User:Noldoaran|Noldoaran]] 18:45, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)


maybe you could meet a girl in the office of the psychiatrist where you should be going to book yourself a long series of appointments

I like the ideas on this topic; especially the 'don't be discouraged' part, where it states that you'll either succeed or get good practice experience. Come to think of it, certain parts of daily living can be approached this way.</text>

== Description: ==

One plant centered on page. 

: Root: long straight rhizome, covered with scales or round stalk scars.
: Stem: single, vertical, slightly bent, shooting out from middle of rhizome; dark painted. 
: Branches: there is the stub of a lost branch at mid-stalk.
: Leaves: a single large leaf, horizontal, shaped like a very fat C, with smooth rim. Painted solid dark.
: Stalk: short.
: Flowers: one white flower, pointing almost straight up.
: Stalk: long, light colored, with a darker vein; part of it obscured by leaf which should be behind it.
: Chalyx: well-drawn, with thick tongue-shaped sepals, light colored.
: Petals: well-drawn, flaring, lily shaped, serrated edges, white underpaint.
: Core: not visible.
: Stamen: long, with a few short hairs.

Two paragraphs (with lines, respectively), left- and
right-justified: one at the top, interrupted by the single flower,
and one just below mid-page, interrupted by the main stem.

== Comments: ==

The plant looks quite natural and well-drawn.

Presumably, the flower stem was in front of the leaf in the
original drawing; but the dark overpaint covered it. The original
outline of the leaf may have been obscured, too.

The leaf shape suggests it is a water plant. With that assumption,
the choices are quite few. Rene suggested

'''Nymphaea candida (a.k.a. Nymphaea alba; water lily, seerose)'''

==Description:==

One plant, flush against the right margin.

: Roots: a bunch of unbranched tentacle-like roots radiating from the stem's base. Light colored, partial dark overpaint.
: Stem: rather thick, bent. Light colored, dark overpainted stripe (shadow) along its left side.
: Branches: none.
: Leaves: lance-shaped with an S bend, very dense, growing straight off the stem on both sides, each partially covering the previous one. Stem ends with one unpaired leaf. Light colored,  with a dark-painted shadow on the bottom of each leaf, and a dotted line just inside the leaf's rim.
: Flowers: none.

Four paragraphs (with 9.5, 3.5, 2.7, and 2.8 lines): a longer one
at the top, and three short ones just below mid-page. The first
two are left-justified and follow the plant's outline on the
right. The last two are left- and right-justified, and interrupted
by the main stem.

==Comments:==

The plant looks strange because of the dense leaves. Perhaps they
are actually the sheaths of leafstalks, badly drawn? Perhaps the
dots along the leaf rim are short spines?

==Description:==

One plant, flush against the bottom and right margins of the page.

: Root: single long root, consisting of six &quot;telescoping&quot; conical segments, dark painted, with flat light-painted top.  Tip of root is bent into a hook and ends with a small round knob.
: Stem: long, straight, vertical, with a dark &quot;shadow&quot; stripe crudely painted along its length.
: Branches: none.
: Leaves: paired,  disk shaped with two &quot;tails&quot;, two &quot;arms&quot;, and a swallowtail-shaped &quot;head&quot;, with long outward-curved tips. 
: Stalks: medium length, thin.
: Flowers: two, very unequal size, growing out of the tip of the stem.
: Stalks: short, thin, like leaf stalks.
: Calyx: heavy, swollen, shaped like a sweet potato cut in half, dark painted.
: Petals: single row, light, semicircular, very small.
: Core: flat, light-colored, filled with dots; looks like a pepper shaker.

Two paragraphs (with 6.0 and 7.5 lines), both in the top half of
the page. The text is left-justified and follows the plant outline
on the right.

==Comments:==

The plant looks quite strange. The telescoping root is hard to
explain. The leaf shape is unusual but not impossible. The bloated
flower chalices are very strange; they may have been drawn from
pressed and dried specimens.

==Description:==

One plant, mostly in the right half of the page.

Two paragraphs (with 3.8 and 8.6 lines), both above mid-page. The
first is left- and right-justified, and interrupted once by the
flowers; the second is left-justified and follows the plant's
outline on the right.

==Comments:==

Plant appearance: very normal, exceptionally well-drawn. The layout
of leaves and flowers is very naturalistic.  The &quot;dark painter&quot;
apparently spared it.

==Description:==

One plant, mostly in the right half of the page.

Two paragraphs, both above mid-page. The first is left- and
right-justified; the second is left-justified, and follows the
plant's profile on the right.

==Comments:==

Plant appearance: somewhat bizarre, and badly drawn. It seems to have
two types of leaves. The lower ones are too small, badly spaced
and badly proportioned, and in unnatural positions. The upper ones
look like pompons. The root has a strange, ungainly shape (but
that may be the work of the Dark Painter). The stems have uneven
and unnatural thickness.

This drawing is almost certainly an expanded version of plant
[[f101r1]][1,5]. Stolfi suggested that the person who drew this page
thought that the star-shaped things in [[f101r1]][1,5] were flowers,
so he supplied fantasy leaves; and he only noticed the mistake
halfway through the plant.

==Description:==

One plant, horizontally centered, reaching only 3/4 up the page.

: Root: five unbranched roots, mostly horizontal.  Each root looks like an earthworm, light-colored with a few dark dots, with a  short and fat swelling about 4/5 of the way to the tip.

: Stalk: straight, vertical, slightly tapered, uncolored(?).

: Leaves: a single ring of large, lance shaped leaves, closely spaced, attached mid-stem with no stalks. The leaves curl down in a semicircle, like an umbrella, until they almost touch the stem again; their thin tips curl further into hooks. Dark overpaint.

: Flowers: one, at tip of stem, pointing up. 

: Stalk: medium, thin, uncolored(?); extension of stem.

: Chalix: thimble-shaped, partial dark overpaint.

: Petals: long, hair like, drooping.

: Core: hemispherical, like a bubble.

Two paragraphs (with 3.6 and 2.5 lines), both above the plant,
left- and right-justified.

==Comments:==

The plant looks very strange but not impossible.  The oddest
details are the position of the tubers, the shape and disposition of
the leaves, their curled tips, the &quot;shaggy dog&quot; flower.

==Description:==

One branching plant that takes up the lower 3/4 of the page.

: Root: two dark-painted potato-shaped tubers next to the stem, with a few medium-length &quot;mousetail&quot; roots shooting from them.

: Stem: straight and vertical, light under(?)color, with a fantastic loop at the top. The stem's base is wrapped with a short uncolored sheath.

: Branches: several, diagonal, mostly straight.

: Leaves: four lobes with serrated edges, naturalistically curved.  Each lobe has a central vein.

: Stalks: medium-short, thin, look like  branches. Light coulored, many of them with crudely overpainted dark splotches.

: Flowers: several, medium-small, mostly upright, some drooping. 

: Stalk: short, sometimes bent by weight.

: Chalyx: rounded, light colored, like a rose's but on the fat side.

: Sepals: short and pointed, light colored.

: Petals: half a dozen, small, tongue-shaped, spread out; dark overpaint almost but not quite fills their outline.

One paragraph (5.5 lines) above the plant, left- and
right-justified.

==Comments:==

The plant looks fairly normal, except for the fantastic
loop in the stalk.  Leaves and flowers are very naturalistic,
but some are spoiled by the crude dark overpaint.

== Coulomb's Law for Point Charges ==

The repulsive or attractive '''electrostatic force''' between two point charges is determined by  an equation called '''Coulomb's law'''. Consider the situation where we have two charges, labeled for convenience ''q'', and ''Q'' (&quot;q&quot; or &quot;Q&quot; are common variables to describe a point charge, and we will use these letters to describe charges throughtout this book). The following picture shows charge ''q'' at a certain point with charge ''Q'' at a distance of ''r'' away from it.  The presence of ''Q'' causes an electrostatic force to be exerted on ''q''.  The distance vector between ''Q'' and ''q'' is '''r'''.

[[image:Coulomb's_Law_between_2_Charges.PNG|center]]

Using '''Coulomb's Law''', we can find the strength of the electric force between these two charges:

{{eqn|Coulomb's Law}}
:&lt;math&gt;F = k_\mathrm{e} \frac {q Q}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Where: &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{e}&lt;/math&gt; = Coulomb's constant = ''8.9875 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;   N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' in free space.

{{SideBox|Students who have studied Gravity may recognize that Coulomb's Law looks very similar in form to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.}}

The magnitude of the electrostatic force ''F'', on charge ''q'', due to charge ''Q'', equals '''Coulomb's constant''' times the product of the two charges (in coulombs) divided by the square of the distance ''r'', between the charges ''q'' and ''Q''.   
{{-}}

== Dielectrics ==

The value of Coulomb's constant given here is such that the preceding Coulomb's Law equation will work if both ''q'' and ''Q'' are given in units of coulombs, ''r'' in meters, and ''F'' in newtons and there is no dielectric material between the charges.  A '''dielectric material''' is one that reduces the electrostatic force when placed between charges.  Furthermore, Coulomb's constant can be given by:  

{{eqn|Coulomb's Constant}}
:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac {1}{4 \pi  \epsilon }&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;epsilon; = '''permittivity'''. When there is no dielectric material between the charges (for example, in free space or a vacuum),

{{eqn|Permittivity of free space}}
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon _0 = 8.85419 \times 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{(N \dot m^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

Air is only very weakly dielectric and the value above for &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will work well enough with air between the charges. If a dielectric material is present, then:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon  = \kappa \epsilon _0\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;kappa; is the '''dielectric constant''' which depends on the dielectric material.  In a vacuum (free space), &amp;kappa; = 1 and thus &amp;epsilon; = &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. For air, &amp;kappa; = 1.0006. Typically, solid insulating materials have values of &amp;kappa; &gt; 1 and will reduce electric force between charges. The dielectric constant can also be called '''relative permittivity''', symbolized as &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; in [[Wikipedia:Dielectric|Wikipedia]].  

This shows that the electric force between the charges decreases as the charges are located further from each other by the square of the distance between them.  As the charges become located further enough apart, their effect on each other becomes negligible.

== Force Vectors ==

Any force on an object is a vector quantity. In a force vector, the direction is the one in which the force pulls the object. The symbol '''F''' is used here for the electric force vector.  If charges ''q'' and ''Q'' are either both positive or both negative, then they will repel each other.  This means the direction of the electric force '''F''' on ''q'' due to ''Q'' is away from ''Q'' in exactly the opposite direction, as shown by the red arrow in the preceding diagram.  If one of the charges is positive and the other negative, then they will attract each other. This means that the direction of '''F''' on ''q'' due to ''Q'' is exactly in the direction towards ''Q'', as shown by the blue arrow in the preceding diagram.  The Coulomb's equation shown above will give a magnitude for a repulsive force away from the ''Q'' charge.  If the magnitude given by the above equation is negative due to opposite charges, the direction of the resulting force will be towards ''Q'', an attractive force.  In other sources, different variations of Coulombs' Law are given, including vector formulas in some cases (see Wikipedia link and reference(s) below).

=== Vector Form ===

We can ''vectorize'' Coulomb's Law to use position and force vectors instead of scalar quantities. We can express the location of charge ''q'' as '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;, and the location of charge ''Q'' as '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;. In this way we can know both how strong the electric force is on a charge, but also what direction that force is directed in. Coulomb's Law using vectors can be written as:

{{eqn|Coulomb's Law (vectors)}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{kqQ(\mathbf{r}_q - \mathbf{r}_Q)}{|\mathbf{r}_q - \mathbf{r}_Q|^3}&lt;/math&gt;

If we have '''r''' = '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; - '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''r'' = |'''r'''|, then we can rewrite this equation as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{kqQ\mathbf{r}}{r^3}&lt;/math&gt;

The vector '''F''' is a force vector that shows the direction and the magnitude of the force.

=== ''n'' Charges ===

In many situations, there may be many charges, ''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', through ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', on the charge ''q'' in question.  Each of the ''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' through ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' charges will exert an electric force on q.  The direction of the force depends on the location of the surrounding charges.  A Coulomb's Law calculation between ''q'' and a corresponding ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' charge would give the magnitude of the electric force exerted by each of the ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' charges for ''i = 1'' through ''n'', '''but''' the direction of each of the component forces must also be used to determine the individual force vectors, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. To determine the total electric force on ''q'', the electric force contributions from each of these charges add up as '''vector''' quantities, not just like ordinary (or scalar) numbers.   

:&lt;math&gt;\vec {F_e} = \vec {F_1} + \vec {F_2} + \vec {F_3} + ..... + \vec {F_n}&lt;/math&gt;

The total electric force on ''q'' can be added to any other forces affecting it as a '''vector''' quantity to obtain the total force vector on the charged object ''q''.  In many cases, there are billions of electrons or other charges present, so that geometrical distributions of charges are used with equations stemming from Coulomb's Law.  

We can re-write Coulomb's law as a sum of ''n'' charges:

{{eqn|Coulomb's Law (n charges)}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F_n} = \sum_{i \ne n} \frac{q_n q_i(\mathbf{r}_n - \mathbf{r}_i)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0|\mathbf{r}_n - \mathbf{r}_i|^3}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Linguistics''' is the study of human language(s) by scientific method(s) in the spoken, written and preconscious form.

Languages that cannot be reliably classified into any family are known as language isolates.

In the scientific practice of linguistics, several distinct areas of study are recognized. Each represents a different aspect or level of abstraction.  These range from Phonetics--the study of the acoustic, anatomical, and other such aspects of the physical production or qualities of vocal sounds; to syntax--the study of the rules and organization of words and the relationships existing between them.

* '''Phonetics''' is the study and systematic classification of the sounds made in spoken utterance.
* '''Phonology''' is the study and description of the sound changes in a language.
* '''Morphology''' is the study of the internal structure of words.
* '''Syntax''' is the study of the structure of phrases, sentences and language.
* '''Semantics''' is the study of the relationship between words and their meanings.
* '''Pragmatics''' is the study of how meaning changes according to context.
* '''Stylistics''' is the study of why a particular choice of language is used in a particular context.

=== Computational Linguistics ===

An interdisciplinary field dealing with the statistical and logical modeling of [[Wikipedia:natural language | natural language]] from a computational perspective. This modeling is not limited to any particular field of linguistics.

There are two major purposes of computational linguistics:
# To help linguists study natural languages more easily
# To make it possible for ordinary people to use natural language when using a computer

Computational linguists often use large bodies of digitized text or speech called [[Wikipedia:Text corpus | corpora]] as a basis for teaching computer programs the proper use of a language, or to compare the use of a language in one context to it's use in another context.  This is also called [[#Corpus.5CText Linguistics | corpus linguistics]].

Some of the practical uses of computational linguistics include:
* [[Wikipedia:Speech recognition | Speech recognition]]
* [[Wikipedia:Speech synthesis | Speech production]]
* [[Wikipedia:Machine translation | Machine translation]]
* Improvements to [[Wikipedia:data mining | data mining]], including [[Wikipedia:search engine | search engine]] design.

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Pieter Jansegers.

I'm a teacher of French in the Dutch speaking part of Belgium.

I did study French and Italian (both litterature and linguistics) at the University of Ghent.

I'm an ICT enthusiast and my contribution on this system will be concentrated on three points:

1) French

2) linguistics

3) ICT use in general

==Razón de Cambio==

1) Una escalera de 2m está apoyada contra una pared, la base de la escalera resbala alejandose de la pared, a razón de 0.3m/s. ¿Con qué rapidez desciende el extremo superior de la escalera cuando se encuentra a 0.8m del piso?

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=0.3m/s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=? cuando x=0.8m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y^2+x^2=4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2yy'+2xx'=0*&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Si x=0.8&lt;/math&gt;

Problemas de razones de cambio relacionadas

16)De un tubo sale arena a razon de 16 pies^3/seg, si la arena al caer siempre forma un cono cuya altura siempre es 1/4 del tamaño de la base que tan rapido aumenta h cuando el monton tiene una h de 4 pies.

ANS:
se sabe que h= 4 pies, y nos preguntan dh/dt es decir la razon de cambio de la altura con respecto al tiempo y tambien se sabe que 16pies^3/seg es dv/dt es decir la razon de cambio del volumen con respecto al tiempo.

:&lt;math&gt;V=1/3pir^2h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=1/3pi(2h)^2h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=1/3pi(4h^2)h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{4pi}{3}*3h^2\frac{dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=4pi*h^2\frac{dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dt}*\frac{1}{4pih^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt}=16pies^3/seg*\frac{1}{64pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dt}=0.0795pies^3/seg&lt;/math&gt;

Esta pagina como cualquier pansamiento de calculo por mas minimo que sea se lo dedico al Profesor Alejandro Bello en muestra, de que si fuy capas y que muchas veces la perdida de una materia no es absoluta culpa del alumno si no tambien del profesor.
Manos mal en este vacional, enconre a tres profesores aunque solo nos tocara dos, y cada uno mas que dejarme conocimientos de calculo, me devolvieron la confianza y el cariño natural que siente una ingeniera por el calculo.

==Agradecimiento==
Es para mi extraño escribir un agradecimiento sin hacer uso de la tinta, pero lo importante es la inspiración que proviene de la satisfaccion de lo echo y aun mas cuando existe tanta dedicacion y esfuerzo de mi parte. 
Pero como yo no soy autosufiente ha personas a las cuales le agradesco, empesemos por mi papá, gracias papi pues eres el es que paga la cuenta de internet para q yo pueda trabajar en este proyecto y asi no me tire calculo por insegura, tambien debo agradecer a Camilo mi monitor por sus exelentes claras y concisas explicaciones, a el profe Offray ya que gracias a el aprendi utilizar un editor de ecuaciones, por compartir con nosotros experiencias de las cuales siempre me acordare y tendre presentes y ademas por no tomar represarias por vernos  mi, a Pablito y Jaimito donde el paisa.

QUIZ # 4

Concidere las siguientes afirmaciones y diga si son verdaderas  o falsas segun corresponda:
1. Si &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; es una funcion cuntinua en reales, entonces &lt;math&gt;\ Df(x)&lt;/math&gt; existe para todo número real. 
:Esta afirmación es falsa.
Porque Aunque existe un teorema que dice &quot;deiferenciabilidad implica continuidad: Si &lt;math&gt;\ Df(c)&lt;/math&gt; existe entonces un &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; que es continua&quot;, pero el inverso de este teorema es falso pues hay funciones que son continuas pero no diferenciables. Caso qu se da cuando la grafica de una función tiene esquinas ejemplo valor absoluto, ó la grafica de la funcion tiene recta tangente que  se dirige hacia infinito en el eje de las y.   
----
2.Cualquier función trigonométrica es derivable en su dominio.
:Esta afirmacion es verdadera.
Pues con base en el aspecto de las graficas sen y cos supondriamos q son continuas, y deacuerdo con la definición de senx y cosx se sabe que las coordenadas en el punto p son (senx,cosx). Cuando x tinende a 0 vemos q p tiende a el punto (1,0) y por consiguiente cosx tiende a 1 y senx tiende a 0. Cuando realizamos los limites de estas dos funciones y nos demuetran que son continuas en todos los realoes hasta en el cero, sinedo así a el sen y el cos se pueden aplicar las formulas de la diccion de funciones y asi deducir q son continuas en todas partes. 
Pero si tenemos en cuenta que &lt;math&gt;\frac {f}{g}=&lt;/math&gt; si &lt;math&gt;\ g(c)&lt;/math&gt; debe ser diferente de &lt;math&gt;\ 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Hay que tener en cuenta que en la funcion tangente &lt;math&gt;\frac {senx}{cosx}=tangx&lt;/math&gt; en tonces tangente seria discontinua en los puntos en que cosx vale 0. pero es importante ver que la afirmación nos habla de el dominio propio de la función siendo esta una restricción para que la firmación sea completamente verdadera.   
----
3.Si&lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; es derivable en &lt;math&gt;\ x=a&lt;/math&gt; y &lt;math&gt;\ Df(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;, entoces&lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt;tiene un maximo o un minimo local en &lt;math&gt;\ x=a&lt;/math&gt;.
:Esta afirmación es falsa:
pues sí &lt;math&gt;\ x=a&lt;/math&gt; y es un punto en el que &lt;math&gt;\ Df(a)=a&lt;/math&gt;, lo llamamos punto estacionario, pues la grafica se coloca en una trayectoria horizontal, ya que la recta tangentye es horizontal,
Esto lo podemos sustentar por el teorema de los puntos criticos, que en ningun momento nos hablan de puntos maximos y minimos de una ves, para conocer estos devemos tener en cuenta el criterio de la segunda derivada 
----
4.Si &lt;math&gt;\ f(x)=a^x&lt;/math&gt; con &lt;math&gt;\ a&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, entonces &lt;math&gt;\  f&lt;/math&gt; es concava en todo su dominio.
:la afirmacion es vedadera.
Las graficas que pertenecen a esta funcion con la restriccion que se da en la afirmacion solo se tama la seccion concaba de la función.
&lt;math&gt;\ f(x)=a^x&lt;/math&gt; con &lt;math&gt;\ a&gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ Df(x)=a^x.ln.a&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;\ Ln.y=x.ln.a&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac {Dy}{y}=ln.a &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ Df=a^x.ln.x&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ segundaDf=a^x-{(ln.a)}^2&lt;/math&gt;
----
5.Si &lt;math&gt;\ Df(a)&lt;/math&gt; esta definida en un intervalo avierto &lt;math&gt;\ I&lt;/math&gt; y &lt;math&gt;\ SegundaDf(a)&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; para todo &lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; pertenece &lt;math&gt;\ I&lt;/math&gt;, entonces &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt; es concava en &lt;math&gt;\ I&lt;/math&gt;.
:La afirmación es vedadera.
Porque el teorema de concavidadque dice que sea dos veces derivable en el intervalo abierto &lt;math&gt;\ I&lt;/math&gt;

:1. Se da un tabla de valores para &lt;math&gt;\ f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ g&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\ Df&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt;\ Dg&lt;/math&gt;.

:Si &lt;math&gt;\ h(x)= g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt; , el valor de &lt;math&gt;\ Dh(1)&lt;/math&gt;es igual a

:a.34        b.5        *c.36*        d.24        e.30

:&lt;math&gt;\ Dh=Dg(f(x)).Df(x)&lt;/math&gt;Planteamos una regla de la cadena
:&lt;math&gt;\ Dh(1)=Dg(f(1)).Df(1)&lt;/math&gt;y evaluamos cuando las x valen 1.
:&lt;math&gt;\ Dh(1)=Dg(3).4&lt;/math&gt;Como cuando x vale 1 Df vale 4, reemplazo
:&lt;math&gt;\ Dh(1)=9.4&lt;/math&gt;Como cuando x vale 3 Dg vale 9, reemplazo
:&lt;math&gt;\ Dh(1)=36&lt;/math&gt;

:2. Un punto se mueve a lo largo de un eje coordenado horizontal, de manera tal que su posición, 

en el instante t esta especificada por &lt;math&gt;\ S=t^3-12t^2+36t-30&lt;/math&gt;. Aqui &lt;math&gt;\ s&lt;/math&gt; 

se mide en centímetros y &lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; en segundos. ¿Cuando se mueve el objeto a la izquierda?

:a.&lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; pertence &lt;math&gt;\ (-infinito,2)&lt;/math&gt;U&lt;math&gt;\ (6,+infinito)&lt;/math&gt;
:b.*&lt;math&gt;\ t &lt;/math&gt; pertenece &lt;math&gt;\ (2,6)&lt;/math&gt;*
:c.&lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; pertenece &lt;math&gt;\ (-infinito,6)&lt;/math&gt;U&lt;math&gt;\ (18,+infinito)&lt;/math&gt;
:d.&lt;math&gt;\ t&lt;/math&gt; pertenece &lt;math&gt;\ (6,18)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ S=t^3-12t^2+36t-30&lt;/math&gt; Tomamos la ecuacion y la derivamos

&lt;math&gt;\ S=3t^2-24t+36&lt;/math&gt; Despues de estar derivada la igualamos a cero para hallar puntos 

criticos pero antes podemos sacar 3ª a todos los terminos

&lt;math&gt;\ t^2-8t+12=0&lt;/math&gt; Ahora si igualamos a cero para hallar puntos criticos

&lt;math&gt;\ (t-6)(t-2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ t=6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ t=2&lt;/math&gt; Estos son los puntos criticos

:Intervalos 
:&lt;math&gt;\ (-infinito,2)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ (2,6)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ (6,+infinito)&lt;/math&gt; 
Y facilmente podemos asegurar que la particula se mueve a la izquierda es en el intervalo &lt;math&gt;\ 

(2,6)&lt;/math&gt;

3. Un rectangulo tiene dos vertices en el eje x y otros dos sobre la parabola &lt;math&gt;\ 

y=12-x^2&lt;/math&gt;. Vease la figura.
:¿Cuales son las dimenciones del rectangulo de este tipo con area maxima?

:&lt;math&gt;\ Area=2x.y&lt;/math&gt; Primero planteamos la ecuacion de area para el rectanulo 
:&lt;math&gt;\ y=12-x^2&lt;/math&gt; y luego al observar la ecuacion de la parabola me da el valor de &lt;math&gt;\ 

y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ Area= 2x(12-x^2)&lt;/math&gt; y reemplazamos la ecuacion de la parabola en la del area
:&lt;math&gt;\ Area=24x-2x^3&lt;/math&gt; realizamos operaciones
:&lt;math&gt;\ DArea=24-6x^2&lt;/math&gt;derivamos la ecuacion resultante
:&lt;math&gt;\ 24-6x^2=0&lt;/math&gt;igualamos la ecuacion a cero para poder encontrar el valor de x y os 

puntos criticos.
:&lt;math&gt;\ -6x^2=-24&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ x^2=\frac{-24}{-6}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ x^2=4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ x=\sqrt[2]{{4}}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ x=+-2&lt;/math&gt;
:Intervalos
:&lt;math&gt;\ (-infinito,-2)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ (-2,2)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ (2,+infinito)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ x=2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ x=4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ y=12-x^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ Y=12-2^2&lt;/math&gt;Reemplazo en la ecuacion de la curva el valor de x que es 2
:&lt;math&gt;\ y=12-4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ y=8&lt;/math&gt;
Despues de este corto y simple proceso deducimos que las dimenciones del rectangulo con area 

maxima son de &lt;math&gt;\ y=8&lt;/math&gt; y &lt;math&gt;\ x=2&lt;/math&gt;

===RAZON DE CAMBIO===

1)El radio de un circulo cambia a razón de &lt;math&gt;\frac {-2}{pi}m/sg&lt;/math&gt;. ¿Cual es la razón de cambio del area del circulo cuando &lt;math&gt;r=10m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dr}{dt}=\frac {-2}{pi}m/sg&lt;/math&gt; y &lt;math&gt;r=10m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A=pir^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt}=2pir\frac {dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt}=2pi(10)\frac {-2}{pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt}=-40m^2/sg&lt;/math&gt;

2)El area de la superficie de un cilindro circular recto se relaciona con el radio de la base r y la altura h mediante la ecuacion &lt;math&gt;s=2pir^2+2pirh&lt;/math&gt;
:a)¿Como se relaciona &lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt},\frac {dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; si h es constate?
:b)¿Como se relaciona &lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}y\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; si r es constate?
:c)¿Como se relaciona &lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt},\frac {dh}{dt};\frac {dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; si ni r, ni t,ni h son constates?

a)&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=4pir\frac {dr}{dt}+2pih\frac {dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=(4pir+2pih)\frac {dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

b)&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=0+2pih\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=2pih\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

c)&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=4pir\frac {dr}{dt}+2pih\frac {dr}{dt}+2pir\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=2pi\frac {dr}{dt}(2r+h)+2pir\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

3)Un balón esférico se infla a razón de 100 pies cúbicos por minuto. ¿Cuál es la razón de crecimiento del radio en el instante en que el radio mide 10pies?
:&lt;math&gt; V=\frac {dv}{dt}=100pies/mn&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dr}{dt}=?&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac {4pir^3}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac {4pi3r^2}{3}(\frac {dr}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V}{\frac {4pi3r^2}{3}}=(\frac {dr}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {100}{\frac {4pi3(10)^2}{3}}=(\frac {dr}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {100}{\frac {3769.9}{3}}=(\frac {dr}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {3769.9}{300}=(\frac {dr}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;

4)Dos automóviles parten de un mismo punto en igual momento. Uno se dirige hacia el norte a una velocidad constante de 25Km/h, y el otro se dirige al oriente a una velocidad constante de 60Km/h. ¿Qué tan rápido aumenta la distancia entre ellos después de 1 hora? 

:&lt;math&gt;z^2=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2z\frac {dz}{dt}=2x\frac {dx}{dt}+2y\frac {dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dz}{dt}=\frac {dx}{dt}+\frac {dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dz}{14}=\frac {d60}{140}+\frac {d25}{14}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dz=85Km/h&lt;/math&gt;

5)Dos lados de un triangulo tiene longitudes de 12m y 15m respectivamente. El ángulo formado por ellos aumenta a razón de 2º/mn. ¿Con qué velocidad aumenta la longitud del tercer lado cuando el ángulo formado por los lados de longitud fija es 60º?  

:&lt;math&gt;z^2=x^2+y^2-2xycostheta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^2=144+225-2(12)(15)costheta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^2=369-360costheta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^2=369-360cos(60)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^2=369-180&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z=\sqrt [2]189&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z=13.74&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2z\frac {dz}{dt}=-360(-sentheta)\frac {dtheta}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dz}{dt}=\frac {180sentheta\frac {dtheta}{dt}}{z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dz}{dt}=\frac {180sen(60)(2)}{13.74}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dz}{dt}=22.7m/mn&lt;/math&gt;

==MAXIMOS Y MINIMOS===

¿Cuál es la máxima área que puede tener un triangulo rectángulo cuya hipotenusa tenga 5cms de largo?
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac {base*altura}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z^2=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z=5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;25=x^2+y^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt [2]{25-x^2}=y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac {x\sqrt [2]{25-x^2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A'=\frac {1}{2}\sqrt [2]{25-x^2}+(\frac {x}{2})\frac {-2x }{2\sqrt [2]25-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A'=\frac {25-x^2-x^2}{2\sqrt [2]{25-x^2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;25-2x^2=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x=\sqrt [2]\frac {25}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt [2]{25-\frac {25}{2}}= y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt [2]\frac {25}{2}= y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac {\sqrt [2]\frac {25}{2}*\sqrt [2]\frac {25}{2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac {25}{4}cm^2&lt;/math&gt;


2) Hay una ventana que tiene la forma de semicírculo montado sobre un rectángulo. El rectángulo es de cristal transparente, mientras que el semicírculo es de un cristal de color que transmite la mitad de luz por unidad de área que el transparente. El perímetro total es fijo. Hallar las proporciones de la ventana que proporcionen la mayor cantidad de luz. No considere el grosor del marco.

:&lt;math&gt;Perimetro=x+2y+\frac {2pir}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P= x+2y+pi\frac {x}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {P}{2}-\frac {x}{2}-\frac {pix}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:A= área del rectángulo + área del semicírculo
:&lt;math&gt;A= x*y+\frac {pir^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A= x(\frac {P}{2}-\frac {x}{2}-\frac {pix}{4})+\frac {pix^2}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A= \frac {Px}{2}-\frac {x^2}{2}-\frac {pix^2}{4})+\frac {pix^2}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A= \frac {P}{2}x-\frac {x^2}{2}-\frac {3pix^2}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A'= \frac {P}{2}-x-\frac {6pix}{16}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {P}{2}=x+\frac {6pix}{16}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {P}{2}=x(1+\frac {3pi}{8})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {P}{2}=x(\frac {8+3pi}{8})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {8p}{2(8+3pi)}=x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {4p}{8+3pi}=x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {P}{2}-\frac {4P}{2(8+3pi)}-\frac {pi4P}{4(8+3pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {P}{2}-\frac {2P}{8+3pi}-\frac {piP}{8+3pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {P(8+3pi)-4P-2piP}{2(8+3pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {8P+3Ppi-4P-2piP}{2(8+3pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {4P+piP}{2(8+3pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {P(4+pi)}{2(8+3pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y= \frac {P(4+pi)}{16+6pi}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=18-x&lt;/math&gt;
:Vcilindro=(área de la base)(altura)
:&lt;math&gt;V=pir^2h&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=pix^2y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=pix^2(18-x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V=18pix^2-pix^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V'=36pix-3pix^2=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3pix (12-x)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;12-x=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x=12&lt;/math&gt;

1)(purcell 3.9)Un disco metálico se dilata con el calor. Si su radio aumenta a razón de 0.02 pulgadas por segundo.¿Con qué rapidez aumenta el área de una de sus caras, cuando su radio es de 8.1 pulgadas?

&lt;math&gt;\frac {dr}{dt}=0.02&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {da}{dt}=?/ r=8.1p&lt;/math&gt;

La fórmula que nos permite llevar a cabo este ejercicio es:
&lt;math&gt;\ A=Pir^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt}=2Pir\frac {dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

reemplazo los valores conocidos, en la fórmula obtenida al derivar:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt}=2(3.14)(8.1)(0.02)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dA}{dt}=1.01\frac {p^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

(purcell 3.9)De un tubo sale arena a razon de 16 pies cúbicos por segundo. Si la arena al caer forma un montón cónico en el piso, cuya altura siempre es 1/4 del diámetro de la base. Qué tan rápido aumenta la altura cuando el montón es de 4 pies de altura?

El volúmen del cono de arena es:
:&lt;math&gt;\ V=\frac {pir^2h}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

h(t)= Altura del cono de arena en el instante t
r(t)= Radio del circulo de la base del cono de arena
v(t)=volumen del cono de arena
&lt;math&gt;\frac {dh}{dt}=?/h=4 pies &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V(t)}{d(t)}=16 p^3&lt;/math&gt;

La fórmula para el volúmen del cono, tiene una variable no deseada r; no es deseada puesto que no conocemos su razón dr/dt. entonces lo dejamos en un variable conocida:

sabemos que el diámetro es igual a decir 2r.

:&lt;math&gt;\ h=\frac {1}{4}diametro&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ h=\frac {1}{2}r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ 2h=r&lt;/math&gt;

Este resultado se reemplaza en la ecuación original.
:&lt;math&gt;\ V=\frac {1\pi(2h)^2h}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ V=\frac {\pi4h^3}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dv}{dt}=\frac {4\pi}{3}3h^2\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dv}{dt}\frac {1}{4pih^2}=\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dh}{dt}=16\frac {1}{4\pi(4)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dh}{dt}=\frac {1}{4\pi}\frac {p}{s}&lt;/math&gt;

(purcell 3.9)Una escalera de 20 pies está recargada contra un edificio. Si la perte inferior de la escalera se desliza a lo largo del pavimento alejándose directamente del edificio a una velocidad de 1 pie por segundo, ¿Qué tan rápido está descendiendo el extremo superior la escalera, cuando cuando el pie de la escalera está a 5 pies de la pared?

S=20 pies (la longitud de la escalera se toma como un valor constante)
h(t)= Altura de la pared
x(t)= Distancia desde el pie de la escalera hasta la pared

La fórmula a ultilizar en este ejercicio es pitágoras:
:&lt;math&gt;\ s^2=x^2+h^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dx}{dt}=1\frac {p}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dh}{dt}=?/x=5&lt;/math&gt;

se reemplazan los valores conocidos en la fórmula original.
:&lt;math&gt;\ (20)^2=x^2+h^2&lt;/math&gt;

y se deriva:
:&lt;math&gt;\ 0=2x\frac {dx}{dt}+2h\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Como no conocemos el valor de h, lo encontramos despejandolo de la fómula original:
:&lt;math&gt;\ s^2-x^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ (20)^2-(5)^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ 400-25=h^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ h=19,36&lt;/math&gt;

Ahora el resultado se reemplaza:
:&lt;math&gt;\ -2x\frac {dx}{dt}=2h\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ -2(5)=2(19,36)\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {-10}{19,36}=\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dh}{dt}=-0,25&lt;/math&gt;

El signo negativo indica que el cambio de h con respecto de t va disminuyendo.</text>

'''Tomatoes with Cheese Stuffing''' - The addition of cheese to the stuffing used in stuffed tomatoes means added flavor, as well as nutritive value in the form of protein, the food substance in which the tomatoes themselves are lacking. The bread crumbs used for the stuffing supply a large amount of carbohydrate, so that the completed dish, besides being a very attractive one, contains all the food principles in fairly large quantities. Stuffed tomatoes may be served as the main dish in a light meal or as a vegetable dish in a heavy meal.

==Ingredients==
* 6 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 cup bread crumbs
* 1 cup grated [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/8 tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbl.]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] hot water

==Procedure==
# Select medium-sized tomatoes and hollow out the centers, reserve pulp.
# Mix the crumbs, cheese, salt, pepper, butter, and hot water with the pulp from the centers of the tomatoes.
# Fill the tomatoes with this stuffing, place in a pan, and bake in a moderate oven until the tomato can be pierced easily with a fork.
# Serve hot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am preparing to teach a writing course at a university here in Minnesota.  I received my BA at the University of Kansas in English Literature and Creative Writer.  Doing work in a text book setting is kind of a new thing for me, so I hope that I don't go too crazy.  Big words are not generally my thing.  The work I want to accomplish with Wikibooks is going to be in the Literature department for the most part.  I would also like to dabble in History, but it looks like there are a lot of articles in there already.  I'll see what I can do.</text>

'''Apple Tapioca''' - The combination of fruit and tapioca is agreeable to most people. Peaches and apples, either fresh or canned, are used most often for this purpose. For this recipe, the apples should be somewhat sour, as there will then be more character to the dessert. Canned or fresh peaches or canned pineapple may be used in exactly the same way as apples. If canned fruit is used, not so much sugar nor baking in the oven will be necessary.

==Ingredients==
*3/4 cup pearl [[Cookbook:Tapioca|tapioca]] or 1/2 c. minute tapioca (instant)
*2 cups boiling water
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
#If pearl tapioca is used, soak it for 4 or 5 hours and then drain off all the water. Minute tapioca will need no soaking. Add the tapioca to the boiling water and salt.
#Cook in a double boiler until the tapioca is entirely transparent. 
#Pare (peel) and core the apples. Place them in a buttered baking dish, fill each cavity with sugar and cinnamon, and place a piece of butter on top of each. 
#Pour the hot tapioca over these, place in a hot oven, and bake until the apples are soft. 
#Serve either hot or cold with sugar and cream.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Arabic alphabet consists of 17 shapes. The Arabic alphabet represents 28 constanants. In order for Arabic writing to represent 28 consonants with 17 shapes without ambiguity, dots are used. Later foreign languages took Arabic shapes, and added dots to make letters needed to represent their language correctly.

Early Arabic writing included no dots. The dots found today in Arabic writing were one of the first innovations that came after the spread of Arabic (after Islam). These dots make it clear what consonant is to be pronounced. Before the dots, people read the text without any dots. They could do this through experience, and using context to differentiate between words that sound different and look the same. Arabic Writing has been using dots since the dotting system was first invented. 

A need for a rigid orthography (writing system) with no ambiguity arose in the early days of Islam. This was due to the influx of non-native speakers trying to read the language. With new converts unused to reading Arabic, they made mistakes while reading texts. Thus they would learn to pronounce a word incorrectly. 

*Example: kitaab AND kutaab are not differentiated without the vowel marks. (which are not usually used)
*Example: bint AND bayt are not differentiated in writing without using the dots (which are always used today)

To ensure the language remains intact, as well as keeping the pronunciation of religious text correct, rulers introduced ''the Dotting'' whereby dots and indicators were added to individual letters to help with pronunciation and to differentiate them from those based on the same form. First the dots were added, later on signs to indicate vowels were introduced in the same manner and for the same reasons.

Modern Arabic books and print media usually do not indicate the vowelling in the text. However, they do indicate the consonants (they are all fully dotted (not dotting a text correctly is considered a spelling mistake)). Educated and fluent speakers do not need the indication of the short vowels and are used to reading text without it. The short vowels are indicated to some extent in Children's books, when children learn to read.

As you begin to feel more comfortable with the script and text, your need for pronunciation indicators diminishes. All modern Arabic texts include the dotting of the forms which indicates what consonant is pronounced, but do not fully indicate the vowels.

The Qur'an provides an ideal text to practise your pronunciation of various letters and words. The feeling of intimidation when you first see an excerpt of the text is understandable. Should you experience this, there are a plethora of books that explain the concepts in easy step by step lessons.

==About Japanese food==
The word ''Gohan'' (御飯) means rice but because rice is the staple diet of the Japanese, it also means '''meal''' and applies to all food.

===Meal===
A typical Japanese meal consists of:
*Rice
*Main dish (fish or meat)
*Side dish (cooked vegetables)
*Soup (usually Miso soup)
*Pickled vegetables

===Custom===
Before eating, Japanese put their hands together as if in prayer and say '''''Itadakimasu''''' (頂きます). This is a polite phrase meaning &quot;I receive (this food with thanks)&quot;.

After eating, both hands are put together as before and '''''Gochisousama deshita''''' (御馳走様でした) is said. This is another polite phrase meaning &quot;That was a feast&quot;

===Eating===
When eating a traditional Japanese meal, the usual order is as follows:
*Take a bite from the main dish or side dish.
*Eat a bit of rice
*Drink some soup straight from your soup bowl (no spoons are used)
This order is then repeated.

*Leave some rice remaining in your bowl.
*Eat the pickled vegetables.
*Don't leave any rice in your bowl, this is considered wasteful and impolite.

===Vegetarians and Japanese Food===
On the surface, Japanese food might seem very friendly for vegetarians. Indeed, its extensive use of vegetables clearly makes it quite healthy. However, fish is an important ingredient in almost all Japanese dishes, even when it's not immediately apparent. Japanese cooking employs dried fish products shaved on the top of many foods, but most problematic for vegetarians is ''dashi'', a broth made of dried bonito fish that is used extensively through the cuisine. This stock appears in many foods that would otherwise appear vegetarian, such as ''miso'' soup. Although miso is made of a fermented soybean paste, it is traditionally added to a ''dashi'' base, and it's almost impossible to find ''miso'' soup at a restaurant in Japan that does not contain ''dashi''. Similarly, other foods such as ''tamago-zushi'' (egg custard sushi), which many ovo-vegetarians would enjoy, also generally contains ''dashi'' broth.

==Problemas de razón de cambio==

1.  Un aeroplano que vuela hacia el oeste a 300 millas por hora pasa por arriba de la torre de control al mediodía y un segundo aeroplano que vuela hacia el norte, a la misma altitud, a 400 millas por hora, pasa por por la torre una hora después. ¿Que tan rápido está cambiando la distancia entre los aeroplanos a las 2:00 pm?

Primero se identifican las variables que vamos a utilizar durante la resolución del problema:

x(t): es la distancia recorrida por el avión numero 1 a la 1 pm (para este caso avión uno lo nombraremos como A1)
y(t): es la distancia recorrida por el avión numero 2 a a 1 pm ( igual que en el anterior lo nombraremos como A2)
x'(t): es la derivada de la distancia de A1 por lo tanto es la velocidad de A1 que es 300 m/h
y'(t): la velocidad de A2 que es de  400 m/h
lo que tenemos que buscar es s'(t) que es el cambio de distancia entre los dos aviones.

Despues pasaremos a graficar la situacion para que nos sirva como apoyo sabemos en que direcciones se dirigen los aviones por lo tanto nos da un triangulo rectangulo de donde los catetos seran &quot;x&quot; y &quot;y&quot; y la hipotenusa sera &quot;s&quot; y el origen sera la torre de control.

sabemos que como el A1 lleva una velocidad de 300m/h significa que cada hora el avion recorrerá 300 millas, por lo tanto cuando el A2 pasa por la torre de control a la 1 el A1 llevara recorrido 300 millas.

La ecuación principal nos quedaría asi:
                       
&lt;math&gt;(300 + x)^2+ y^2= s^2&lt;/math&gt;
para este caso reeplazamos por &quot;x&quot; 30  y a &quot;y&quot; 400
&lt;math&gt;(300 + (300))^2+ (400)^2= s^2&lt;/math&gt; 
y como queremos conocer el valor de s sacamos la raíz cuadrada y nos da como resultado que s=721.11
Como ya conocemos el valor de s, sacamos la derivada de la ecuación principal:

&lt;math&gt;(300 + x)^2+ y^2= s^2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2(300 + x)\cdot x'+ 2y\cdot y'= 2s\cdot s'&lt;/math&gt;
 y como queremos conocer s' entonces la despejamos en la ecuacion
&lt;math&gt;\frac{(300 + x)\cdot x'+ y\cdot y'}{s}= s'&lt;/math&gt; reemplazamos por los valores que obtuvimos anteriormente &lt;math&gt;\frac{(300 + 300)\cdot 300+ 400 \cdot 400}{721.11}= s'&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; 471.45 m/h= s'&lt;/math&gt; esta es la respuesta al problema.

2.   Cada arista de un cubo variable esta aumentando a razon de 3 pulgadas por segundo que tan rapido esta aumentando el nivel del cubo cuando una arista es de 12 pulgadas de longitud?

x(t): la longitud de una arista
v(t): el volumen del cubo
x'(t): 3 pulg/seg
v'(t): es la incognita a encontrar

El volumen de un cubo es &lt;math&gt;v(t)=x^3&lt;/math&gt; 
sacamos la derivada
&lt;math&gt; v'(t)=3 \cdot x^2\cdot x'&lt;/math&gt; 
reemplazamos 
&lt;math&gt; v'(t)=3\cdot(12 pulg)^2\cdot(3 pulg/seg&lt;/math&gt; 
donde 
&lt;math&gt; v'(t)=1296 pulg^3*seg&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ r=\frac {4h}{10}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ r=\frac {2h}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

luego se deriva y se remplaza en la ecuaciòn del volumen

:&lt;math&gt;\ v=\frac {4*phi*r^3*\frac {dr}{dt}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ 5m^3/min=4*phi*\frac {2h^2}{5^2}*\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ 5m^3/min=4*phi*\frac {2h^2}{25}*\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dr}{dt}=\frac {5m^3/min*25}{4*phi*{2h^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ds}{dt}=?&lt;/math&gt;



:&lt;math&gt;\ Solucion:&lt;/math&gt;

primero se despeja el valor de la que forman la altura
y la distancia con el observador.

:&lt;math&gt;\ s^2=h^2+150^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ s=(50^2+150^2)^\frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ s=70000^\frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ s=264.57pies&lt;/math&gt;

luego se derivan las variables y se remplazan los valores.

:&lt;math&gt;\ s^2=h^2+150^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ 2s*\frac {ds}{dt}=2h*\frac {dh}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Ejercicio 5

Suponiendo que una burbuja de jabon mantenga 
una forma esferica constante, ¿cual sera la rapidez de cambio
del radio de la burbuja, cuando el radio sea igual a 2 pulgadas,
sabiendo que se le inyecta aire a razon de 4 pulgadas cubicas por segundo?.

:&lt;math&gt;\ Datos:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ r=2pulg&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dv}{dt}=4pulg^3/sg&lt;/math&gt;

Hi all, I have a basic doubt about calculus, in partial differential Equations. ie how to solve a PDE of two or More functions.
for eg
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{r}  \frac {\partial (r*u(r)*psi(r)*rho)}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;


:Extend the methods used for systems of ODE's. If the PDE's are linear, for example, it may be possible to eliminate one function and get a single PDE of higher order. [[User:Carandol|Carandol]]

== Problem ==

Hi, I found this site very intersting. I still have a problem: I don't know how to solve an hyperbolic partial differential equation like:

f(x)D^2g(x,t)/Dx^2 - D^2g(x,t)/Dt^2= 0, 

where f(x) is a positive real continuous function. Can anybody help me please? Thanks a lot,

                                                    Cris

== Page Layout for Computer Monitors ==

It is an amazing fact that here we are, thirty years into personal computing, and we still handle text as though a page were 8.5 inches by 11.  We haven't noticed that the computer screen is generally 3x4 in aspect ratio, with 12 x 16, the extended screen, on the horizon.
 
Seems to me a simple thing follows: text should generally be formatted in 3x4 ratio chunks, and all the stuff around the margins -- headers, logos for the source organization, &quot;print,&quot;  &quot;bulletin board&quot; and all those other allied services --  jammed into a single pop-up box that could be accessed by clicking on an inconspicuous switch in the corner of the screen.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Klugscheisser. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Klugscheisser~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Apparently, you wrote , or mostly wrote, the Wikibooks module [[Modern Physics:Math:Vectors]], however never uploaded many of the pictures for it, in particular Figures 2.1 - 2.4.  Are you going to finish the pictures in this module, especially

== User:Carandol has added vector pictures 1 - 4 ==

User [[User:Carandol]] hass added pictures 1 - 4 in place of the empty spaces for Figures 2.1 - 2.4 in module [[Modern Physics:Math:Vectors]], which you had started.  Do you want to check to see what Carandol did?  Also I'm thinking of adding more pictures myself showing scalars.  &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ASP.NET}}

ASP.NET is a web programming platform developed by Microsoft.  It is the successor to [[Active Server Pages]].  The term &quot;classic ASP&quot; is often used to distinguish previous versions of Active Server Pages with the .NET (pronounced &quot;dot net&quot;) versions.  

This wikibook is an introduction to ASP.NET.  It assumes no prior experience with web programming or with any particular web programming language or platform (including classic ASP), though we will often compare ways of doing things in ASP.NET with ways of doing them in other languages, especially [[PHP]].  We believe the differences between classic ASP and ASP.NET are substantial enough to merit separate treatment.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

This tasty dish is usually cooked along with roasting meat - especially [[Cookbook:Roast Beef|roast beef]] - and is made as follows. 

Beat 4 large spoonful of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], and a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] for fifteen minutes, add in small increments, 1500ml (3 pints) of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], and mix them well together. If you add the milk all at once, the mixture may [[Wikipedia:Curdle|curdle]]. Butter a dripping-pan, and set it on an oven shelf below the [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]], or [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]], while roasting. When it is brown, cut it into square pieces, and turn it over, and, when the under side is browned also, send it to the table on a dish.

==Ingredients==
A more modern recipe, to make 4 individual Yorkshire puddings.
* 4 oz (110g) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 1/2 British pint (10 fl oz = 284 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* dripping from roast meat or sunflower oils
* bun or large muffin tin

==Procedure==
Sift the flour into a bowl and add the salt. Mix the egg into the milk, then add this mix piecewise to the flour, beating with a balloon whisk until all the milk is added and the mixture is well beaten. For best results refrigerate the batter for 1 hour.

Place a little of the dripping or oil into each division of the tin and place the tin in the oven to heat (usually the roast joint will still be in the oven), but if cooking separately heat the oven to 200 to 220 degrees Centigrade / Gas mark 7. Once the tin is smoking hot, fill each division with the batter and return to the oven. Remove and serve when risen, firm and brown.

Note: If your egg is small use two eggs and less milk otherwise the pudding will not rise.

[[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] created this file in July 14-15, 2004 specially for use in Wikibooks.  At this time, there are two modules that link to it: &quot;Charge and Coulomb's Law&quot; in the &quot;Electronics&quot; book and &quot;Coulomb's Law and Electric Field&quot; in the &quot;Modern Physics&quot; book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've already covered coordinate transformations in the section &quot;Coordinate systems and the comma derivative,&quot; so you might wanna take a look at that before you spend time talking about transforming coordinates.

Also, concerning your notation &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu} f &lt;/math&gt;, note that I am going to use the notation &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mu} \mathbf{T} &lt;/math&gt; for covariant differention along &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  However, I AM going to use your notation &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu} f&lt;/math&gt; for scalar-valued functions such as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, so this is good as we are consistent at this point.

Finally, your use of latin indices (i, j, &amp; k) could potentially cause confusion later, as I am going to add a section on the vierbein bundle, at which point latin indices will have a VERY different meaning than greek indices (which I have been using elsewhere so far).  -[[User:Lathem|Lathem]]
--------

You are right.  I'm being very sloppy here, and I should be using 
greek indices.  I'm trying to remember the derivation of the covariant
derivative from memory, and doing a bad job of it.

==Description:==

One plant with no leaves and a single huge flower, spanning the
entire height and width of the page.

: Root: a short, vertical, cylindrical stem that splits into two almost horizontal mousetails.

: Stem: straight, vertical.

: Branches: none.

: Leaves: none.

: Flowers: a single flower at the tip of the stem.

: Stalk: not visible, or indistinguishable from stem.

: Chalyx: eight symmetrical sepals, shaped like long parabolas.

: Corolla: four layers, of decreasing sizes, each having four  symmetric petals, located diagonally with respect to  the previous layer.  

: Core: none.

Two paragraphs (with 4.3 lines and 4.5 lines), both left- and
right-justified: one at the top, interrupted by the flower; one
just below mid-page, interrupted by the main stem.

==Comments:==

Petersen has identified this plant with high confidence
as 

'''Nymphaea alba (white water lily, seerose)'''

http://www.runeberg.org/nordflor/181.html

http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/nymphaea/nymph/nympcan2.jpg

There is indeed a good match in the shape and arrangement of the
petals and sepals. Also, the lack of leaves and branches in [[f7v]] is
plausibly explained by the fact that Nymphaea's flowers float on
the water's surface, and thus may have been hidden from the
artist's view.

But if [[f7v]] is Nymphaea alba, then what do we make of [[f2v]]?

==Description:==

One plant with a single, big, odd-shaped leaf and a &quot;collar&quot;
around its stem, horizontally centered and spanning the page 
vertically from edge to edge.

Three paragraphs (with 6.5, 3.6, 6.6 lines), left- and
right-justified and interrupted by the plant's stem, fill up the
bottom 3/4 of the page. Each paragraph is followed by a
right-justified two-word title.

==Comments:==

The plant is very strange, both for the leaf shape and for the 
&quot;collar&quot; around the stem.  Perhaps it is a mushroom (e.g. Amanita),
which the artist mistook for a plant and tried to draw as such?

The text format too is quite unusual, both in its length and in 
the presence of titles.

==Description:==

One plant, spanning top to bottom, slightly offset to the left.

Two paragraphs (with 10.1 and 5.3 lines), left- and
right-justified: one next to the top margin, one next to the
bottom margin, both interrupted by the plant.

There is a mark in the SE corner, resembling &quot;^pm9&quot; (&quot;^&quot; over the &quot;p&quot;),
with thick strokes.

==Comments:==

The mark in the SE corner is almost surely the quire number,
&quot;1st&quot; in abbreviated Latin.

This [[Wikipedia:FAQ|FAQ]] covers [[Wikipedia:PostScript|PostScript]] language and [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] software suite, as the most common [[Wikipedia:free software|free]] PostScript interpreter.

== General ==

The best way to learn any language is to use it. Pick an interesting problem (for instance [[Wikipedia:quine_(computing)|quine]]) and try to code it in the new language. Download [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] to test your work. 

=== PostScript resources ===
There are several texts and resources on PostScript available free online. Some of these are.

[http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/BLUEBOOK.PDF Blue Book] (PDF 0.9M), PostScript Language Tutorial and Cookbook, Adobe Systems, Addison-Wesley 1985, ISBN 0201101793 is the best introduction to PostScript language. PostScript operators are introduced in easy and well-paced way. Sample programs are easy to read and print beautiful pictures. The book describes only a fraction of level 1 PostScript. By itself it is not sufficient for professional work.

[http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/GREENBK.PDF Green Book], (PDF 0.9M) PostScript Language Program Design, Adobe Systems, Addison-Wesley, 1988; ISBN 0201143968; shows how to use PostScript in real world situations. Among other things, it explains how to re-encode the font. This question is asked almost every month on comp.lang.PostScript. Although the book is based on level 1 PostScript, the good programming practices have not changed so much as the language itself.

[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF White Book] (PDF 0.5M) Adobe Type 1 Font Format, version 1.1, Addison-Wesley, 1990, ISBN 0201570440 describes the format of Type 1 font. The hinting rules description might have been accurate at the time of writing, but modern interpreters seem to use different algorithms. For instance, Adobe interpreters appear to auto-hint diagonal stems.

[http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/PLRM.pdf Red Book] (PDF 7.6M) PostScript Language Reference Manual, Adobe Systems Addison-Wesley, 1999; ISBN 0201379228) 912 pages, is the official description of PostScript language. Everything in the book is important; everything is explained only once. The Red Book is also available on paper for those who prefer to read in bed. An older version (dated 1999), without the necessity of registration in one of Adobe's partner programs, is available [http://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf here].

[http://wwwcdf.pd.infn.it/localdoc/tips.pdf Thinking in PostScript] (PDF 0.8M) Glenn C. Reid, Addison-Wesley 1990; ISBN 0201523728 is a good introduction to PostScript. Many programmers prefer to think in terms of objects and methods but the book is available for free. Why not give it a try?

[http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/technotes/main.html Adobe technical notes for developers] cover many topics not included in the Red Book.

'''news://comp.lang.PostScript''' usenet group is the best place to discuss PostScript and Ghostscript issues.

[http://www.inkguides.com/postscript.asp Jim Land's Collection] of PostScript and Ghostscript resources contains many links to PostScript resources available on the net. 

[http://www.tinaja.com/post01.asp Don Lancaster's PostScript Library] contains dozens of original articles, utilities, and carefully selected links.

[http://www.ghostscript.com Ghostscript community site] among other things hosts mailing lists, documentation archive, and [[Wikipedia:Subversion (Software)|Subversion]] repository with a handy web interface.

[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost Ghostscript home page] is an alternative distribution site for Ghostscript and related programs.

[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1897 SourceForge] is a primary Ghostscript distribution site. The bug tracker and CVS repository are no longer hosted there.

[http://www.ghostgum.com.au Ghostgum Software] is a small software company located in Melbourne, Australia that is developing GSview GUI interface to Ghostscript, and RedMon Windows port redirector. The products and documentation are available for free download. The company also distributes Ghostscript on CD-ROM.

[http://www.artifex.com Artifex Software] is the main developer and
copyright holder of Artifex Ghostscript PostScript, PDF and PCL interpreter technologies. You need an Artifex license if you intend to redistribute Ghostscript technology with your proprietary products, or if you intend to use any source code from Ghostscript technologies within your proprietary products. Please contact them for details.

'''Unfortunately''', many aspects of PostScript language are not documented at all. Ghostscript source code is the best reference to undocumented PostScript. For instance, do you know that Adobe implementations skip &lt;tt&gt;'\t'&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'\r'&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'\n'&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;' '&lt;/tt&gt; after &lt;tt&gt;eexec&lt;/tt&gt; but don't skip &lt;tt&gt;'\0'&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'\f'&lt;/tt&gt;. So the binary stream cannot start with some white space characters.

=== How to report a PostScript error? ===

A strange error happened... It crashed... I've done nothing... Help... 

Unfortunately little can be done without the sample file and detailed description of the problem. Please generate and submit the PostScript file &amp;#8212; that's what PostScript programmers know the best. If possible, create a small file: delete insignificant objects in your graphic application and choose small images.

Don't submit native application files. Most likely PostScript programmers don't have your applications. [[Wikipedia:Quark, Inc.|Quark]] alone has several mutually incompatible versions of
[[Wikipedia:QuarkXPress|QuarkXPress]] which cost from $500 to $2000 each. Some parts of the PS files come from a PostScript driver or [[Wikipedia:PostScript Printer Description|PPD]]. It is very difficult to reproduce the user's environment exactly on the developer's computer.

Never send the file to discussion groups, unless the file is hand-made, ASCII only, and fits on the screen. Most readers don't need your file, many have slow modem connection, some even pay for the Internet traffic. Put the file on FTP or HTTP server and post the URL. If you don't have a site, you can get a free one from many free ISPs.

With a prior agreement, you can send small files ( &lt; 7M ) by email. Normally ISP limits the size of a single message to 10M but base 64 encoding expands files 1.25 times. If you absolutely need to submit a big file (&gt;300M), mail it on CD or DVD.

Bugs in Ghostscript should be entered directly into [http://bugs.ghostscript.com Ghostscript Bugzilla].

=== Who can help me? ===

This is a list of people and companies that are willing to
answer user's questions about PostScript and related technologies
and do custom software development.

[http://www.gnu.org/prep/service.html GNU service directory]
is a list of people and companies who offer support services for GNU
software, for a fee or in some cases at no charge.
Many of them also offer support for non-GNU free software and
general consulting.

[http://www.scguild.com/ Software Contractors' Guild] is a resume
database run by software contractors/consultants who want
to expand the range of choices available to them and to their clients.
About 50 people offer PostScript services.

== Using PostScript ==
=== Do I need a PostScript printer? ===

There are several situations when PostScript printer is desirable:

* you need to print documents with placed [[Wikipedia:Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] files  
* you receive print jobs from 3rd parties and need a portable [[Wikipedia:page description language|page description language]] 
* you expect to print variable content documents
* desktop printer serves as a cheap proofer for a more expensive printer or imagesetter 
* vector page description is much shorter than the raster image of the page 
* you run [[Wikipedia:Unix-like|Unix-like]] system where PostScript language serves as a printer API. 

Software [[Wikipedia:Raster image processor|RIP]] with a non-PostScript printer is becoming a good alternative to a PostScript printer. Unlike built-in [[Wikipedia:Raster image processor|RIP]] the software and hardware can be easily upgraded. The host OS also provides a better debugging environment.

=== How to create a PS file? ===

PostScript is a low level [[Wikipedia:page description language|page description language]]. The PostScript graphic model is based on presentation elements: lines, curves, characters, images. There is no notion of words, paragraphs, justification, footnotes, etc. Most authors prefer to work on the higher level and generate presentation formats (PostScript, [[Wikipedia:Portable document format|PDF]], [[Wikipedia:PCL|PCL]], etc.) from the high level page description.

[[Wikipedia:TeX|TeX]] is a typesetting program designed for high-quality composition of material that contains a lot of mathematical and technical expressions. It has been adopted by many authors and publishers who generate technical books and papers. It was created by Professor Donald Knuth of Stanford University, originally for preparation of his book series ''The Art of Computer Programming''.

[[Wikipedia:groff|groff]] (GNU [[Wikipedia:troff|troff]]) software is a typesetting package which reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces
formatted output. 

PostScript printer driver on [[Wikipedia:Mac OS|Mac OS]] and [[Wikipedia:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] can generate PostScript file from the incoming GDI calls. So every application that prints can also generate PostScript. However the set of graphic primitives in the file will be limited by the GDI graphic model. Most graphic editors and DTP applications bypass GDI and generate PostScript directly. This helps to generate better PostScript and provides more flexible graphic model to the application. 

Sometimes it is necessarily to create or modify PS files by hand. PostScript files can be big and contain binary data. The text editor should not expand tabs or normalize line ending. emacs is a good choice because it is extensible and includes a PostScript major mode.

=== How to send a PS file to a printer? ===

On a Unix-like system you can use
  [[Wikipedia:lpr|lpr]] -S computer_name -P queuename filename.ps

On Microsoft Windows you can send the file to a printer as:
  copy /b filename.ps lpr1	
or
  copy /b filename.ps \\computer_name_or_ip\printersharename
Some of the printers also support lpr protocol

PrintFile is a freeware GUI Windows program that copies files the system print queue. It can also pick pages from the DSC-conforming PostScript file.

On Mac OS Classic you can drop the file on the printer icon.

=== What is the best way to view a PS file on the screen? ===

PostScript file is designed for sequential printing - images are often stored as inline streams, page size and resolution is a part of page description.

The viewer is expected to browse the document in random order and magnification. This can be achieved by converting the PostScript to an internal form that enables direct access to page elements and fast clipping of invisible objects. None of the PostScript viewers work this way.

GSview is a free graphical interface for Ghostscript developed by Russel Lang at Ghostgum Software. The page selection is implemented through DSC processing; zoom is implemented by re-interpretation of the page. GSview is available for Win32, Win32s, OS/2 and GNU/Linux. Older versions are available for Win16. There are other graphical X-Window front ends for Ghostscript - examples are mgv, Moonshiner and Okular.

PostScript can be easily converted to PDF using Ghostscript, ps2pdf online, Distiller, PDFCreator and a few of other programs. There are many more PDF viewers than PS viewers. Furthermore PDF viewers often are more user friendly than most PS viewers, the most convenient way to view a PS file is to convert it first into a PDF file.
The most popular free PDF viewers are Adobe Reader, Evince, Foxit Reader, MuPDF, Okular, PDF-XChange Viewer, Sumatra PDF and Xpdf.

=== How to send a binary PostScript file to an ASCII-only printer? ===

Many network printers don't accept PS files containing binary data.

Sometimes it is impossible to re-create the file as 7-bit ASCII but any file is easy to convert to ASCII stream and execute it through the corresponding decoding filter. The following script converts standard input to hexadecimal stream and adds the decoding code. All DSC comments will be hidden but most printers ignore them anyway. The script was tested on [[Wikipedia:bash|bash]] and [[Wikipedia:GNU/Linux|GNU/Linux]] systems. 

  #! /bin/sh
  echo '%!'
  echo 'currentfile /ASCIIHexDecode filter cvx exec'
  od -A n -v -t x1
  echo '&gt;'

The version of the script for MS-DOS and Windows has to read
&lt;tt&gt;'&amp;gt;'&lt;/tt&gt; character from itself because &lt;code&gt;echo &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; prints &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
(with the quotes).

  @echo off
  rem &quot;&gt;&quot;
  echo %%!
  echo currentfile /ASCIIHexDecode filter cvx exec
  od -A n -v -t x1
  od -A n -v -t c -j 16 -N 1 %0

&lt;tt&gt;od&lt;/tt&gt; (octal dump) comes from GNU [http://www.gnu.org/directory/textutils.html Textutils] package. It is available on all stock Unix-like systems (including Mac OS X) and can be installed on Windows with Cygwin or
MinGW packages.

PostScript utilities can be easily coded in PostScript language. The following program reads the input file or standard input, compresses it, optionally converts to ASCII85 stream, and writes to output file or standard output. The program is run by Ghostscript as:

  gs -q [-dASCII] [-dLEVEL3] -- encode.ps [INFILE [OUTFILE]]

Where:
:&lt;code&gt;-q       &lt;/code&gt; suppresses writing of copyright information to stdout&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;-dASCII  &lt;/code&gt; selects ASCII85 encoding&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;-dLEVEL3 &lt;/code&gt; selects Flate encoding introduced in level 3&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;encode.ps&lt;/code&gt; is the program&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;INFILE   &lt;/code&gt; is input file, defaults to stdin&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;OUTFILE  &lt;/code&gt; is output file, defaults to stdout&lt;br&gt;

If needed, DSC processing can be done before downloading the file to the printer. Development of a DSC-aware ASCII85-based converter is left for the exercise of the reader.

=== How to print an EPS file? ===

Encapsulated PostScript, or EPS, files are
usually meant for inclusion in printable PostScript or other EPS files.
Unlike the printable PostScript they can have:
* &lt;tt&gt;showpage&lt;/tt&gt; operator not included
* image shifted outside of the printable area
* image size too big or too small
* PC-style header and preview

Thus, sending EPS files to a PostScript printer directly may cause a PostScript
error or only page to be
printed.

The standard way is to place EPS in the page in a graphic design
application and print.

In order to directly print an EPS file, you need to add a PS header
that does all the necessary adjustments.
  cat header.ps file.eps | lpr
A suitable header is given as an example on the [http://www.anastigmatix.net/postscript/Import.html net.anastigmatix.Import resource page].

=== How to check whether a PostScript file is valid ? ===

Send the file to a PostScript interpreter. If you like the results the file is valid. PostScript interpreters include: 

* Any PostScript printer 
* Ghostscript 
* Acrobat Distiller 
* Display PostScript

There are others of course, but these are the simplest/cheapest to get hold of.

In fact this will check correctness of the PostScript program only on the interpreter where it has been tested. Different interpreters provide very different execution environment that can make PS program take a different branch.

PostScript program can produce unexpected output without reporting any PostScript errors. In the mission-critical situation a proof page printed on the laser printer and signed by the designer is mandatory.

=== How to count pages in a PS file? ===

Interpret the file using bbox device and count HiResBoundingBox lines.
 gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=bbox foo.ps 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -c HiResBoundingBox
Somewhat faster is also the command
 yes | gs -q -dBATCH -sDEVICE=nullpage foo.ps | grep -c showpage
Assuming the document is DSC-conforming one can count &lt;tt&gt;%%Page&lt;/tt&gt; comments
directly in the document.
 grep -c %%Page: file.ps

=== How to determine which pages are color and which are monochrome? ===

First, you need to decide what makes the page a color page. Probably, monochrome page has zero density of CMY components. To check this using Ghostscript you need to select a true color CMYK device, install correct CRD and rasterize the file.

The page is a color page if any pixel has non-zero components in CMY planes.

=== How to print only some pages from a PS file? ===

DSC (Document Structure Convention) was intended to provide an easy way to parse the PostScript document, rearrange pages, add missing fonts, substitute images, etc. Although most programs generate DSC comments few programs use them. It appears that correctness of DSC comments has been never tested even by major vendors.

Sometimes the document claiming DSC conformance fails with PostScript errors after modification. Even worse the pages can be spoiled in some subtle way. For instance, some characters of the incrementally downloadable font may be silently replaced with a default character.

Page selection based on DSC comments is used by PrintFile and GSview.

PDF can serve as a convenient intermediate format esp. when page extraction is performed more than once. You can use Ghostscript to convert the file to PDF and extract a range of pages as following: 
  ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
  gs -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=2 output.pdf
Occasionaly, other graphic formats can work better than PDF. The author once wrote bilist.cpp to place 2 A5 pages on a single A4 page and rearrange pages into signatures for some old PCL printer.

=== How to rearrange pages of a PS file for printing a brochure? ===

There are several ways to solve this problem. Every approach has its advantages.

Direct manipulation preserves most of PS structure and takes least processor time. Unfortunately, it is only applicable for DSC-conforming PostScript files. Although most DSC files generated by mainstream applications claim DSC conformance few have been tested as such. For instance, Microsoft PS driver generates non-conforming files by default.

&lt;tt&gt;psselect&lt;/tt&gt; from [http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~ajcd/psutils/index.html psutils] can select and reorder pages in the DSC-conforming PS file. 

Conversion to raster image is a simple and reliable approach. For instance [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ps-collection/utils/bilist/bilist.cpp?view=markup bilist.cpp] extracts pages from the PCL file, reorders pages into signatures, and places them 2-up. Ghostscript can be used for PostScript to PCL conversion.

Conversion to PDF greatly simplifies further document processing. Pages in PDF file can be extracted and printed in any size or order. The PostScript file can be converted to PDF using several applications. For instance, Ghostscript 
  ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
To extract a range of pages from a PDF file  into another PDF file use 
  ps2pdf  -dFirstPage#111 -dLastPage#666 input.pdf output.pdf 
To extract a range of pages from a PDF file  and convert to PS file use: 
  ps2ps  -dFirstPage#111 -dLastPage#666 input.pdf output.ps 
It is always safe to concatenate PDF files as following 
  gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=file.pdf \
     -c save pop -f file1.dsc file2.dsc file3.dsc ...
The methods above are sufficient to rearrange pages in any order but complex jobs can be done more efficiently. The PDF file can be convertrd to a simple DSC-conforming PS file. 
  pdf2dsc source.pdf output.dsc
The output file will be very simple, because all the complexity is hidden inside Ghostscript libraries. The format is trivial to modify using any DSC utility, text editor, or script. 
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0

  /Page null def/Page# 0 def/PDFSave null def/DSCPageCount 0 def

  pdfopen begin
  %%Page: 1 1

  %%Page: 2 2
  2 DoPDFPage
  %%Trailer
  currentdict pdfclose end end end
  %%EOF
Updated file can be converted back to PDF. 
  ps2pdf source.dsc result.pdf
The DSC file uses GS libraries, which is fine if the DSC file is fed to Ghostscript only. To generate a portable PS file convert it back to PS.

=== Why does my PS driver generate color drawings but grayscale images? ===

When the driver generates PostScript stream for monochrome printer it often converts color images to grayscale for better transmission time, faster rendering, and lower resource usage. Conversion of vector objects to grayscale doesn't save much space or time. So the driver leaves it to the PostScript interpreter.

This problem often happens when the job is printed to Generic PostScript printer driver. Generic driver is not the best one. It is limited to the common subset of PostScript language available on most printers. It is monochome, has small choice of media, fonts, no special features.The PostScript file from Generic driver will print on wide wariety of printers but many features will be missing. 

Although it appears like every printer uses a special driver it is the same driver configured for different printers. The driver takes configuration parameters from PPD file. When possible the native PPD file should be used. The Acrobat Distillir PPD is a good choice to generate a color PostScript file free of vendor-specific features.

=== How to recombine plates in preseparated PostScript file? ===

It is very simple to rasterize the pages and recombine the pages into the composite file. Rasterization can be done at 8 bit per plane or 1 bit per plane depending whether any color correction is desired for the composite image.

Merging the planes on vector level is much more difficult. The only known tool for this job is the Seps2Comp Acrobat plug-in from Creo (now discontinued and unsupported). The PostScript file can be converted to PDF using a number of programs including Ghostscript and Acrobat Distiller.

=== How to remove black frames around n-up pages? ===

Windows driver generates black frames around virtual pages when it does n-up printing. The frames are drawn in  &lt;tt&gt;nupshowpage&lt;/tt&gt; procedure. To remove the frames this procedure must be modified. On level 3 interpreters
&lt;tt&gt;Hack-MSDriver-n-up&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;IdiomSet&lt;/tt&gt; can identify and replace this procedure when the job file is loaded by the interpreter.
No modification of the job file is needed. 
To activate the replacement you need to copy the idiom file to &lt;tt&gt;/Resource/IdiomSet/&lt;/tt&gt; directory on the printer or host-based interpreter.
The PostScript root directory on a host-based interpreter likely to be different from the system root.
For one-time replacement you can also prepend the &lt;tt&gt;IdiomSet&lt;/tt&gt; file to the job file. 

For level 1 and 2 interpreters one has to remove &lt;tt&gt;framenup { ... } if&lt;/tt&gt; fragment from the
job file itself using any text editor.

=== How to extract figures from PostScript files? ===

Figures in PostScript document are often included as EPS files and can be easily extracted
with a text editor. In the DSC-conforming document the EPS file is framed by
using a text editor.
  %%BeginDocument
  ...
  %%EndDocument
Don't forget that EPS files can be nested.

EPS files extracted from the PostScript file don't have a preview, which can be
re-generated with Ghostscript.

=== How to change color PostScript to black-and-white?* ===
If you can run perl, look for bw_convert, a tiny perl script that will change every RGB color declaration in a PostScript file to a black or grey value. Simply enough, it replaces &quot;setrgbcolor&quot; with &quot;pop pop pop 0 setgray&quot;. The script can be found at [http://www-hermes.desy.de/notes/extras/bw_convert bw_convert]. The script author is not documented on that site. However, this script is really an excellent example of how not to do things; the author has not really grasped that PostScript is a programming language, and that simple lexical changes will often fail, while adding an extra line of code at the start would be more effective. The script also does not touch images, CMYK data, or level 2 color operators.

A similar thing can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of a postscript file:
  /setrgbcolor {0.11 mul 3 1 roll 0.59 mul 3 1 roll 0.30 mul add add setgray} def
It will overwrite setrgbcolor with setgray and calculate a grayscale color. Still this will not affect images and might not change everything that you wanted to change. There also could be other problems so no warranty on that.

=== How to tweak RGB to CMYK conversion but leave other objects intact? ===
Level 3 PostScript has a powerful method for tweaking correction of device-dependent
colors to device-independent colors: &lt;tt&gt;/UseCIEColor&lt;/tt&gt; page device key and
&lt;tt&gt;DefaultGray, DefaultRGB, DefaultCMYK&lt;/tt&gt; color spaces.

When &lt;tt&gt;UseCIEColor&lt;/tt&gt; flag is on, grayscale, RGB, and CMYK colors are interpreted as
the colors in &lt;tt&gt;DefaultGray&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;DefaultRGB&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;DefaultCMYK&lt;/tt&gt; color spaces.
It is little known that an array form of device color spaces ( e.g. &lt;tt&gt;[DeviceCMYK]&lt;/tt&gt;) can be defined
as a &lt;tt&gt;Default*&lt;/tt&gt; resource effectively disabling the corresponding conversion.

Conversion of CMYK to device-independent colors is often undesirable because
of the loss of black generation information.

=== How to get date and time? ===

Built-in access to the date and time is with &lt;tt&gt;currentdevparams&lt;/tt&gt;
and &lt;tt&gt;setdevparams&lt;/tt&gt; on the &lt;tt&gt;%Calendar%&lt;/tt&gt; device, which
appeared in the [http://ftp.ktug.or.kr/obsolete/info/adobe/devtechnotes/pdffiles/ps2012.supplement.pdf PostScript Language Reference Manual version 2012 supplement] for PostScript LanguageLevel 2.
The following code will write the date and time to standard output:

  (%Calendar%) /IODevice resourcestatus {
    pop pop (%Calendar%) currentdevparams
    dup /Running get {
      dup /Year get 4 string cvs print (-) print
      dup /Month get 2 string cvs print (-) print
      dup /Day get 2 string cvs print ( ) print
      dup /Hour get 2 string cvs print (:) print
      dup /Minute get 100 add 3 string cvs 1 2 getinterval print (:) print
      /Second get 100 add 3 string cvs 1 2 getinterval print (\n) print
    } {
      (Clock/calendar is present but not running.\n) print
    } ifelse
  } {
    (No clock/calendar present.\n) print
  } ifelse

The standard does not provide for timezone information and the clock is
generally set for local time. Its range extends to 2079.
If the interpreter is running on a host operating system, the OS is likely
to determine whether &lt;tt&gt;setdevparams&lt;/tt&gt; can actually set the clock.

A host-based PostScript interpreter can access the file system, including named pipes and devices,
so possibilities are endless. This example was tested on GNU+Linux using the specific interpreter Ghostscript.

Type the following on one terminal:

  mkfifo foo
  while true; do date &gt;foo; done

Type the following on another terminal, in the same directory.

  gs -dNODISPLAY
  /t { (foo)(r) file closefile (foo)(r) file dup
      28 string readstring pop = closefile} def

Now, typing &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; at the Ghostscript prompt shows the current time, using the host OS &lt;tt&gt;date&lt;/tt&gt; command instead of the &lt;tt&gt;%Calendar%&lt;/tt&gt; device.

PostScript has been used to implement an
[http://www.godisch.de/debian/pshttpd/ HTTP server].

=== How to edit a PS file? ===

Few people want to edit HPGL or PCL. PostScript is yet another control language used by some laser printers. In most cases PostScript file is algorithmically derived from some human-readable document. Get the original document, if possible.

Visual editing requires interpretation of the PS file, editing of the objects, and generation of a new PostScript file. Few applications support all features of PostScript graphic model. Unsupported features will be lost or approximated. Being a programming language PostScript can take different branches depending on the execution environment. Untaken branches will be discarded by the interpreter leaving no trace in the editor. When the printer driver generates PS file it doesn't care about preserving high-level structure. It can be very difficult to do something beyond fixing a spelling error or changing a page number.

Many mainstream graphic editors can import PS files. The quality of the built-in interpreters varies and is often limited to level 1. PDF import filter tend to work better; try to convert the PS file to PDF first.

If the PS file has too many primitives unsupported by the visual editor, &lt;tt&gt;pstoedit&lt;/tt&gt; utility from Ghostscript can be used to reduce PostScript file to a sequence of path operations.

Tailor, from EnFocus Software, seems to be the only proprietary PostScript editor available. (It was discontinued long ago). There is also a software from CGS called PDF Tuner that can edit both PostScript and PDF files. This Software is constantly developed.

Manual editing requires good knowledge of PostScript language and a robust text editor. Occasionaly users make PS files over 100M long. The files often contain binary data; sometimes they depend on the exact size of data.. The text editor shouldn't expand tabs or normalize line ends. Hexadecimal view of the file can be handy. 

Redefinition of operators and procedures is a powerful technique to alter the behaviour of a PS file. New code can be included into the RIP startup script, copied by the driver from PPD, or added directly into the file by an input filter. token operator helps to take away the control from the PostScript interpreter when operator redefinition doesn't work.

Idiom recognition is an automated technique to patch a PS procedure when it is bound. Although it was designed to add smooth shading to legacy PostScript programs it can be also used to fix bugs.

=== How to create a PS form and populate it from a database? ===

Fixed format forms can be created in any graphic editor and contain any presentation graphics. The variable content fields can be reserved using placeholder EPS files. 

The placeholder EPS files can be replaced with variable content using standard Unix text tools. For many years a similar technique has been used in OPI workflow.

Alternatively, the placeholder EPS files can be made smart and print themselves. Variable content can be retrieved from PostScript VM or external files.

Variable format documents need text reflow and re-pagination. You have the option of using available resources for [[PostScript FAQ#How to justify text in PostScript?|direct PostScript text formatting]], or creating the report in a higher level page layout language (TeX, groff) and converting it to PostScript or PDF.

In most cases it is impossible to replace words in a PostScript document harvested from a standard PostScript driver. Drivers can fragment the word for kerning without &lt;tt&gt;xshow&lt;/tt&gt;, use hexadecimal strings, or convert the line of text to a sampled image. The latter is a common way to print Asian fonts on Roman printers.

=== How to concatenate several PS files? ===

Contrary to the popular belief PostScript files cannot be concatenated
to get the combined result.
  # won't work
  cat page1.ps page2.ps page3.ps &gt; threepages.ps
Entering the files as a separate [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] arguments won't help either.
  # won't work
  gs -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=threepages.ps page1.ps page2.ps page3.ps
PostScript programs change the state of the PostScript interpreter and these
changes must be undone before the next program runs.
First, write the following header.
  %!
  /begin_file
   { /save_state save def  % save state of PS interpreter
     currentfile
     0 (% $$$ EOF Mark $$$) /SubFileDecode filter cvx exec % safequard against flushfile, etc.
   } bind def
  /end_file
   { clear cleardictstack  % clear after the file
     save_state restore    % restore the state
   } bind def
Include every PostScript file in the following wrapper and append them to the header.
  begin_file
  % Include your file here.
  % $$$ EOF Mark $$$       % don't delete this line
  end_file
The result won't be [[Wikipedia:document structure convention|DSC-conforming]]
even if the original files are. 

Composition of EPS files is done by
[[PostScript FAQ#How to include an EPS file?|placement]] of the files into
a container EPS file.

PostScript interpreters that work in a [[Wikipedia:job server|job server]] mode (most printers,
[[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] 8.50
or higher with &lt;tt&gt;-dJOBSERVER&lt;/tt&gt;) treat multiple jobs delimited with &lt;tt&gt;^D&lt;/tt&gt; character and
piped to the input stream as independent jobs.

In general it is impossible to concatenate several PS programs to get
the combined result. The following program will defeat all
attempts to append something to it. Most commonly such techniques can be found in
[[Wikipedia:Old Composite Font|OCF]] font installers.

  systemdict begin (%stdin) (r) file flushfile

=== How to print accented characters? ===

Single byte PS fonts can include many glyphs, but only 256 of them can be accessed at the same time. The 256 element array mapping a character code to the glyph name is known as an encoding vector. The PostScript language has several built-in encoding vectors. You can (and should always) re-encode your fonts. The ISOLatin1Encoding is probably a good start.  To re-encode the font, what you need to do is:

 /Courier findfont               % load the font, for instance, Courier
 0 dict copy begin               % copy it to a new dictionary
 /Encoding ISOLatin1Encoding def % replace encoding vector
 /MyCourier /FontName def        % replace font name
 currentdict end
 dup /FID undef                  % remove internal data

Re-encoded fonts can be used in the same way as any other fonts. 

There are several ways to print more than 256 glyphs at a time. 
* Create a few re-encoded fonts and select them when needed.
* Use glyphshow for rare characters 
* Make OCF fonts from several re-encoded fonts. OCF supports every imaginable encoding scheme. 
* Make a composite font from CMap and Font or CIDFont resources.

=== How to justify text in PostScript? ===

The common approach is to do text formatting in an application. The application emits PostScript code reflecting the final format - now a simple question of dumping things at x, y coordinates. If an application overrides the default interword/interletter spacing (say, for justification or kerning), it should use PostScript's '''ashow''', '''widthshow''', '''awidthshow''', '''kshow''', '''xshow''', '''yshow''', or '''xyshow''' operators, which take an intact text string and a separate specification for positioning the elements. The sloppy alternative, just using '''show''' on individual letters and small word fragments with '''moveto'''s in between, is a hindrance for text extraction programs and distillers.

To perform common functions of text formatters, such as hyphenation, multi-column text, footnotes, bibliography, glossary, etc., in PostScript itself requires implementing suitable algorithms in
PostScript and supplying them along with the file to be rendered, either included in the file or downloaded in advance. Existing implementations include David Byram-Wigfield's [http://www.cappella.demon.co.uk/tinyfiles/tinymenu.html TinyDict], Graham Freeman's [http://www.cs.adfa.edu.au/~gfreeman/qs.html Quikscript], and Don Lancaster's [http://www.tinaja.com/post01.asp#gonzo Gonzo Utilities]. All three are quite full-featured, with justification, columns, pagination, and many other features. Simpler building blocks include Chapman Flack's [http://www.anastigmatix.net/postscript/Markup.html Markup], which can be used as a front end to those, or to do simple left/center/right unfilled/unjustified text setting on its own, and [http://www.anastigmatix.net/postscript/Hyphenate.html Hyphenate], an implementation of the [[Wikipedia:TeX|TeX]] hyphenation algorithm, for which many language-specific patterns have been compiled. Collectively, these approaches that do the bulk of the computation in PostScript itself can be called (Byram-Wigfield's term) ''direct PostScript'', and the [http://www.anastigmatix.net/postscript/direct.html Anastigmatix direct PostScript page] further describes and compares them.

Automatic [[Wikipedia:kerning|kerning]] requires information that is in the Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files that come with most fonts, so to do it in PostScript would require downloading also the appropriate AFM files and some PostScript code to parse them (the syntax is simple). No direct PostScript resource that does this seems currently available. All of the existing systems do permit manual kerning, which is usually adequate as kerning is most important for large display type, accounting for a small fraction of a typical document.

Designs are not limited to two approaches, all formatting in the application emitting pure PostScript only or full-fledged direct PostScript. The first approach tends to save compute time on the printer at the expense of emitting large, uneditable PostScript files and longer transmission times to the printer, and direct approaches can have compact, editable files (with
fixed prologs of implementation code that can be downloaded once in advance) and do more computation on the printer. Most applications choose a compromise, doing some of the work in the application ''and'' including prologs in the emitted PostScript that provide procedures to
finish the work on the printer itself. It would even be possible to design an application that used one of the existing direct PostScript resources as its prolog, and emitted the document in that form.

=== How to place several copies of a picture? ===

The picture can be a sampled image or EPS file. 

PostScript always reads the standard input stream forward. There is no way to reposition the file or push characters back. Next picture need a new copy of data. To reuse the picture we need to copy the data from the input stream to the reusable object.

Short data can be stored in a PostScript string, but the string length is limited to 64K-1 . More data can be stored as an array of strings. The length of array is also limited to 64K-1 but this is enough to exhaust the memory on most printers. In fact low end printers can have as little as 256K of free memory.

Encoding filters can be used to compress picture data. In level 3 PostScript most encoding filters are optional.

PostScript level 3 introduces reusable streams. They cache the input data and can be repositioned after reading to the end of the file. On disk-less printers reusable streams are implemented in memory file system.

Some printers and most host-based RIP's have writeable file systems. 

To avoid multiple rendering PostScript level 2 introduced forms. It is a wrapper around a procedure that hints PostScript interpreter how to cache rendering results. The form procedure can be executed many times and need reusable data source. Forms are rarely used and many Adobe OEM choose very small default size for the form cache.

=== How to redefine an operator? ===

The simpliest approach is to use &lt;tt&gt;bind&lt;/tt&gt; operator.  
  /foo { bar } bind def
This approach is not recommended in production environment where &lt;tt&gt;foo&lt;/tt&gt; can be already redefined as a procedure. The following approach works in all cases.
  /baz /foo load def
  /foo { baz bar } bind def
Ghostscript also provides implementation-specific ways of operator redefinition. See the comments to &lt;tt&gt;odef&lt;/tt&gt; operator in Ghostscript sources.

Good redefinition should preserve as many features of the original operator as possible. The following simple redefinition of halftone operators can cause several unexpected problems. 
  /sethalftone { pop } bind def
  /setscreen { pop pop pop } bind def
  /setcolorscreen { 12 { pop } repeat } bind def
First, halftone can read data from the current file. Second, differences in error processing may be significant. The stock installation of an early version of Mac OS X generated the following code: 
  featurebegin { 30 60 setscreen % no function!
  } featurecleanup
The redefinitions above would smash the stack and cause a PostScript error regardless of &lt;tt&gt;featurecleanup&lt;/tt&gt;. Here are better redefinitions 
  /sethalftone_orig /sethalftone load def
  /setscreen_orig /setscreen load def
  /setcolorscreen_orig /setcolorscreen load def
  /sethalftone { gsave sethalftone_orig grestore } bind def
  /setscreen { gsave setscreen_orig grestore } bind def
  /setcolorscreen { gsave setcolorscreen_orig grestore } bind def

=== How to concatenate strings? ===

PostScript doesn't have a build-in string concatenation operator. The following procedure, copied from GNU Ghostscript, seems to be the shortest. 
  /concatstrings % (a) (b) -&gt; (ab)  
    { exch dup length    
      2 index length add string    
      dup dup 4 2 roll copy length
      4 -1 roll putinterval
    } bind def  
Concatenation of multiple strings can be done more efficiently than calling &lt;tt&gt;concatstrings&lt;/tt&gt; repeatedly. The strings are stored in array for the convenience of iteration. 
  /concatstringarray  %  [(a) (b) ... (z)] --&gt; (ab...z)  
     { 0 1 index { length add } forall string     
       0 3 2 roll      
         { 3 copy putinterval
           length add 
         }
       forall pop  
     } bind def

=== Where are min and max functions? ===

PostScript doesn't have built-in &lt;tt&gt;min&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;max&lt;/tt&gt; operators but they can be easily coded as procedures. 
  /min { 2 copy gt { exch } if pop } bind def
  /max { 2 copy lt { exch } if pop } bind def
Ghostscript has &lt;tt&gt;.min&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.max&lt;/tt&gt; operators in &lt;tt&gt;systemdict&lt;/tt&gt; .
For the backward compatibility Ghostscript also provides &lt;tt&gt;min&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt&gt;max&lt;/tt&gt; procedures defined as:
  /max { .max } bind def
  /min { .min } bind def

=== How to sort an array? ===

Ghostscript has a [[Wikipedia:bubble sort|bubble sort]] procedure in &lt;tt&gt;gs_init.ps&lt;/tt&gt;. 
  % &lt;array&gt; &lt;lt-proc&gt; .sort &lt;array&gt;
  /.sort 
    { 1 index length 1 sub -1 1 
        { 2 index exch 2 copy get 3 copy	% arr proc arr i arr[i] arr i arr[i]    
          0 1 3 index 1 sub 
            { 3 index 1 index get	        % arr proc arr i arr[i] arr imax amax j arr[j]      
              2 index 1 index 10 index exec
                {                               % ... amax &lt; arr[j]	
                  4 2 roll      
                } 
              if pop pop    
            } 
          for             			% arr proc arr i arr[i] arr imax amax    
          4 -1 roll exch 4 1 roll put put  
        } 
      for
      pop
    } bind def

=== How can I display Copyright and other symbols? ===

From Level 2 on, the glyphshow operator has allowed a named glyph to be displayed:

 % display a &quot;registered trademark&quot; symbol
 /registered glyphshow

=== Where can I get more examples of PostScript code? ===

Books about PostScript include many simple PS programs.

The Ghostscript distribution has a few sample PostScript files in the examples directory.  A large part of Ghostscript is implemented in PostScript language including a PDF 1.4 interpreter. 

Adobe has published a few sample programs for Level 3 features. 

Free sample library contains many good (and bad) PostScript files. The library collects interesting examples of PostScript, PDF, PCL, and TIFF files coded manually or harvested from applications.

=== How to debug a PostScript program? ===

The first skill you should learn as soon as you can is how to interpret PostScript error messages. They are not always easy. Error reporting varies by product. Some products will not give PostScript error details (e.g. [[Wikipedia:Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] import to Photoshop), and are best avoided for any learning purposes.

The standard PostScript error format is something like this

 PS&gt;0 1 2 3 4 5 put
 %%[ Error: typecheck; OffendingCommand: put ]%%
 PS&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; image
 %%[ Error: undefined; OffendingCommand: image ]%%

You will see this includes the error name, and a command causing the error. Please do not describe this as an &quot;offending command&quot; error, since all messages say that, and remember that both error name and offending command are important. The latter message means that a required key was not found in the image
dictionary.

If you happen to be using [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]], you may get more details. Observe that the error message includes the stacks, and the operator name.

 GS&gt;0 1 2 3 4 5 put
 Error: /typecheck in --put--
 Operand stack:   0   1   2   3   4   5
 Execution  stack:   %interp_exit   .runexec2   --nostringval--    
 --nostringval--   --nostringval--   2   %stopped_push   --nostringval--  
 --nostringval--   %loop_continue   2   3   %oparray_pop   --nostringval--    
 --nostringval--   false   1   %stopped_push   .runexec2   --nostringval--    
 --nostringval--   --nostringval--   2   %stopped_push   --nostringval--   
 --nostringval--   --nostringval--
 Dictionary stack:   
 --dict:1044/1123(ro)(G)--   --dict:0/20(G)--   --dict:69/200(L)--
 Current allocation mode is local
 Current file position is 16
You can look at the description of the operator, and the stack to see your operands, and often see why it is complaining. Then you can (sometimes) work out where in your original code the problem lies. Remember that
a failed PostScript operator doesn't change the operand stack.

Ghostscript exits when an error happens in a file passed as a command line parameter. Use operator run
to keep the session and examine operand stack interactively.

  $ gs
  GS&gt; (foo.ps) run

Use the = and == commands to print out information about objects on the operand stack.  To see the contents of a dictionary, push the dictionary on the stack and then use {== ==} forall.  For example, to see the contents of the user dictionary, use userdict {== ==} forall.

Try to run the program on different interpeters. Different error messages may reveral more information about the problem.
[[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] can print detailed dumps of operand and execution stacks when it runs with
-dOSTACKPRINT and -dESTACKPRINT options respectively. The top element of the stack is printed last.

Error handler is a PostScript procedure that runs when PostScript interpreter encounters an error. It is initially installed by the PS interpreter but can be replaced by the job. The error handler provided by the PostScript driver is very basic - delete it. On [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] you will get better error messages with the default error handler. On other interpreters you can use &lt;tt&gt;ehandler.ps&lt;/tt&gt; provided by Adobe. 

If the problem is not yet apparent try to make the smallest possible program that still has the problem by removing or commenting out pieces of code. 
Using &lt;tt&gt;{ ... } pop&lt;/tt&gt; construct is a convenient way to disable parts of PostScript code. Save every version of the file under a different name to have
multi-level undo. When the file is reduced to a single procedure, try to replace it with inline code. When the procedure is buried in other code or redefined several times,
try to load it at the execution spot and print. For instance: &lt;tt&gt;/foo load ==&lt;/tt&gt;.

You can trace a PostScript program by adding print operators into procedures or redefining operators. The [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]] package includes a script ''traceop.ps'' which can help in putting a trace on operators. After including the script near the front of your postscript program, you put &lt;tt&gt;/foo traceop&lt;/tt&gt; at the point where you want to start tracing all calls to operator ''foo''. You then modify procedures &lt;tt&gt;/tracebefore&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/traceafter&lt;/tt&gt; to print some relevant diagnostics. For example, &lt;tt&gt;/tracebefore { count traceprint } def&lt;/tt&gt; would print the whole stack just before entry into /foo. (&lt;tt&gt;/traceprint&lt;/tt&gt; basically does a &lt;tt&gt;{print ==only } for&lt;/tt&gt; as described above.) Operator /foo is then executed as normal.
If a program doesn't render correctly on a raster device, chances are the same problem will occur during PS to PDF conversion. The PDF document preserves more information and can
be interpreted as a trace of graphic operations.

LaserTalk was once part of the Adobe developer's kit. It was a visual front end to the PostScript printer. LaserTalk only traced the top level of execution. 

PSAlter from Quite Software is the only visual PostScript debugger on the market.

=== How to include an EPS file? ===

EPS format is documented in Adobe technical note 5002, [http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/ps/5002.EPSF_Spec.pdf Encapsulated PostScript File Format Specification] (PDF 0.2M) and 2nd edition of PostScript Language Reference Manual. The
specification includes guidelines for creating EPS files (they are simply PostScript programs
that contain a couple of required header comments and promise not to do certain things), and
for importing EPS files. The EPS file text can simply be pasted into the enclosing PostScript
program between a &lt;tt&gt;%%BeginDocument:&lt;/tt&gt; and an &lt;tt&gt;%%EndDocument&lt;/tt&gt; comment.
(The &lt;tt&gt;%%BeginDocument:&lt;/tt&gt; keyword can be followed by descriptive text such as the EPS
file name.) It is the enclosing program's responsibility to establish a suitable state
just before the inserted EPS and restore the prior state afterward. The program should:

* take a state snapshot with &lt;tt&gt;save&lt;/tt&gt;
* redefine &lt;tt&gt;showpage&lt;/tt&gt; as no-op
* set the color space, color, line cap, line width, line join, miter limit, dash pattern, current path, overprint, and stroke adjust modes to specified defaults
* present an empty operand stack and the default dictionary stack (but containing the no-op &lt;tt&gt;showpage&lt;/tt&gt;)
* compute and set a coordinate transformation that puts the EPS figure where it is wanted
* set a clipping path matching the figure's bounding box

After the inserted EPS code, the enclosing program should discard anything the EPS code may have left on the operand and dictionary stacks, restore the prior contents, and then execute &lt;tt&gt;restore&lt;/tt&gt; on the earlier &lt;tt&gt;save&lt;/tt&gt; object, which will undo all of the other
preparations.

Applications that output PostScript typically omit the code to do all of that at every place an EPS figure is inserted, and they often cut corners and omit code that makes simplifying assumptions.
Especially when writing PostScript by hand, it can be more convenient to use, for example,
the Anastigmatix [http://www.anastigmatix.net/postscript/Import.html StatEPSF, ReadyEPSF, ExecEPSF] procedures, which automate the necessary steps. The following code is then all
that's needed to place an EPS at (100,550), rotated 0 degrees and scaled by 1 in both axes:

  % in the document setup:
  /net.anastigmatix.Import /ProcSet findresource begin
  % at the point of import:
  { StatEPSF 100 550  0  1 1 ReadyEPSF ExecEPSF }
  currentfile exch exec
  %%BeginDocument: helloworld.eps
  ... the EPS file contents go here
  %%EndDocument

Of course, nothing stops an application from generating PostScript that way too.

Some EPS files contain preview images. In the DOS/Windows format, they are binary data that must be stripped out when pasting the EPS text into another program. The EPSI preview format is in the form of PostScript comments and can be removed to save space, but will not cause problems if left in place.

=== Does PostScript support unicode for CJK fonts? ===

PostScript does not specifically support Unicode. It includes general support (from level 2) for multi-byte (2, 3 or 4 byte) fonts. Unicode is just a special case of multi-byte encoding. There is no Unicode font as such, but you can use multi-byte CID fonts that provide support for ranges of Unicode.

There are no freely redistributable Unicode CMaps. They can be derived from MS Windows code pages and corresponding Adobe CMaps.

Developers often look for a &quot;simple&quot; way to just include Unicode strings with no checking for ranges, language etc. but this is a pipe dream.

Some PostScript engines also provide support for TrueType fonts that have no CID-mapping internally. In that case, no CID map is needed for these fonts, but only a read filter for decoding a Unicode-encoded stream for the string storing the byte sequences ; several decoding filters are possible, including those supporting UTF-8 and UTF-16, because the PostScript's &quot;read&quot; operator just expects the filter to return any convenient integer that is used as an index to the glyph in the font's dictionary.

Filters, that can be chained and used like other file objects by the &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; operator, are supported in PostScript Level 2. Note that most PostScript applications expect that &lt;tt&gt;bytesavailable&lt;/tt&gt; is the number of integers that &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; can return without waiting or encountering an end-of-file (or end-of-string) condition.

The &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; operator is then not limited to returning integers in the range 0..255, so the actual return value from &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; is a code unit (or code points or glyph ID) in any convenient encoding that is supported as glyph indexes for the selected font, and the &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt; operator will actually read as many bytes from its source (file, string or procedure) as needed by the decoding filter. Other standard filters support data decompression, or decoding hex or ASCII85 sequences from any source.

So instead of enumerating characters in a string using the &lt;tt&gt;forall&lt;/tt&gt; operator, pass the string to a Unicode decoding filter, and use a &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;tt&gt; loop to enumerate characters (or glyph indexes) from the filter object, then render the characters using the returned integer index to lookup for glyphs in a composite font. If the PostScript engine dose not handle a native support for Unicode or TrueType, you'll have to convert the TrueType font into a CID-mapped font and use a filter that will return CID values usable with the CID-mapped font loaded into the document preamble or transfered as a resource before your printed document.

You'll probably also need a layout engine (like &lt;tt&gt;Pango&lt;/tt&gt;) to process the Unicode codepoints into series of glyph ids and precompute their position within the PostScript-rendered document where these will be encoded and decoded by the PostScript engine using the associated filter. Such text layout engine is needed anyway to suppport the BiDi alghorithm, as well as to render complex scripts, ligatures, contextual forms, or variants described in the font used in your document design...

=== PageMaker 7.0 page information fails in level 1 mode ===

PageMaker 7.0 with ''Page Information'' printer's mark set ''ON'' generates incorrect 
PostScript file in level 1 mode. The file fails with &lt;tt&gt;invalidaccess in get&lt;/tt&gt; or
&lt;tt&gt;typecheck in get&lt;/tt&gt; on any interpreter, regardless of the level.

The problem is caused by interaction between PageMaker code
and Windows driver code. To print separations Adobe redefines a few
operators, including &lt;tt&gt;setcolorspace&lt;/tt&gt; and uses them even in level 1 mode.
PostScript driver assumes that &lt;tt&gt;setcolorspace&lt;tt&gt; has no place in Level 1 PostScript and
redefines it as &lt;tt&gt;{pop}&lt;/tt&gt; as a precaution, erasing the earlier definition.
  /setcolorspace{!}b 
To fix the file this definition should be removed or commented out.

See [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]].

=== How to create compressed CMYK TIFF? ===

Ghostscript have five TIFF devices for color management. 
And five TIFF compression devices, which produce only b/w images.

  gs -sDEVICE=tif32nc -sOutputFile=tiger.tiff -dEPSCrop examples/tiger.eps

=== What CJK fonts work on Ghostscript? ===

Unprotected CJK fonts work on Ghostscript just fine. It is not possible to install CSL (Adobe's CID Support Library) but most PostScript programs don't need it. CSL simulates OCF structures for the jobs that assume OCF fonts on the interpreter and manipulate them directly.

Heisei and KozMin CIDFonts are unprotected proprietary fonts developed by Adobe Systems. The installer that comes with the fonts runs on Mac and installs the fonts to a network printer using PAP protocol. To install the fonts on Ghostscript you need to copy CIDFont files to Resource/CIDFont/ directory.

The CIDFont resources are hidden in resource forks of invisible files in Mac file system. [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ps-collection/utils/get-mac-cidfont/get-mac-cidfont.cpp get-mac-cidfont] extracts all CIDFont resources from the input file (normally &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cdrom&lt;/tt&gt;) to a directory. The program also works on Windows NT.

=== How to avoid JPEG compression in PDF? ===

Ghostscript has overly agressive heuristic identifying the images for JPEG compression. Using &lt;tt&gt;setdistillerparams&lt;/tt&gt; operator one can manually select compression algorithm. Ghostscript accepts most [http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/acrosdk/docs/createpdfapi/DistillerParameters.pdf distiller parameters] (PDF 0.6M) as command line arguments in addition to &lt;tt&gt;setdistillerparams&lt;/tt&gt; operator. 

  ps2pdf -dAutoFilterColorImages#false -dColorImageFilter#/FlateEncode \
    -dAutoFilterGrayImages#false -dGrayImageFilter#/FlateEncode foo.ps foo.pdf

Ghostscript developers recognize this as a problem. The fix is expected real soon now.

=== Ghostscript fails with /invalidfont in findfont? ===

Most likely Ghostscript cannot access any fonts at all. To check what directories are searched for fonts, use
  gs -h
or 
  gswin32c -h

=== How to create a semi-transparent object? ===

Adobe introduced semi-transparent objects in PDF 1.4. Many new RIP's (including [[Wikipedia:Ghostscript|Ghostscript]]) accept [[Wikipedia:PDF|PDF]] 1.4 directly. So there is no need for the transparency features in [[Wikipedia:PostScript|PostScript]].

* Ghostscript supports PDF 1.4 in v. 8.00 and up 
* Adobe CPSI supports PDF 1.4 in v. 3015 and up 

Standard PostScript has opaque color model. Newer objects completely obscure the objects underneath but parts of the new object can be excluded from painting by clipping path. On level 3 PostScript a sampled image can be used for clipping another sampled image. On level 2 a similar effect can be achived by painting pattern color through the image mask. 

Very limited transparency effects can be also achived by overprinting spot colors and pure process colors.

PDF 1.4 interpreter in Ghostscript is implemented in extended PostScript language. The extensions are visible to the regular PostScript files and can be used to the same effect. The interface is partly documented in doc/language.htm. Read the source code for details.

=== PostScript output interferes with redirected device output. ===

PostScript files that write to stdout will interfere with device
output to stdout. That is why since v.7.04 Ghostscript can assign the
PostScript %stdout output to a file, leaving the actual stdout 'clean'
for use as device output such as with &lt;tt&gt;-sOutputFile=-&lt;/tt&gt; or
&lt;tt&gt;-sOutputFile=%stdout&lt;/tt&gt;

For instance, to discard PS %stdout output, such as from the '=' operator,
when Ghostscript is being used as a filter the correct command line is:

  gs -q -sstdout=/dev/null -sOutputFile=- - | ...

With a little help from [[Wikipedia:bash|bash]], [[Wikipedia:named pipe|named pipes]] can be used in place of regular
files, avoiding all stdout-stderr problems.

  gs -sDEVICE=pswrite -o &gt;(wc) -c showpage

=== How to fix a file generated by a pswrite device ===

Adobe PostScript interpreters and 
Ghostscript v. 8.55 and higher fail with &lt;tt&gt;/typecheck in --where--&lt;/tt&gt; on
files with non-standard page sizes generated by old versions of Ghostscript
with [[wikipedia::Subversion (software)|Subversion]] revisions 1225 to 2334.
The affected code executes &lt;tt&gt;null where&lt;/tt&gt;, which is not allowed by PostScript language.

The following &lt;tt&gt;IdiomSet&lt;/tt&gt; resource can be installed on the PostScript interpreter
to work around the problem. To activate the &lt;tt&gt;IdiomSet&lt;/tt&gt; you need to copy it to
&lt;tt&gt;/Resource/IdiomSet/&lt;/tt&gt; directory on the printer or host-based interpreter.
The PostScript root directory on a host-based interpreter likely to be different from
the system root. The file name doesn't matter but &lt;tt&gt;FixOldPSwrite&lt;/tt&gt; is suggested.
For a one-time replacement you can also prepend the file to your job file.

&lt;code&gt;
 %!
 % This IdionSet provides backward compatibility with the old pdfwrite.

[[Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|right|Boiling water]]

==Introduction==
'''Boiling''', as it applies to cooking, means cooking foods in boiling water. In most populated parts of the world, plain water boils at temperatures from about 200°F to 212°F (95°C to 100°C). This varies with the atmospheric pressure, which in turn varies with both altitude and weather. When the water is salted, the boiling temperature is slightly higher than for clean water. 

When the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the water is lessened, boiling takes place at a lower temperature than that mentioned, and in extremely high altitudes the boiling point is so lowered that to cook certain foods by means of boiling water is difficult. As the water heats in the process of boiling, tiny bubbles appear on the bottom of the vessel in which it is contained and rise to the surface. Then, gradually, the bubbles increase in size until large ones form, rise rapidly, and break, thus producing constant agitation of the water.

==Effects==
Boiling has various effects on foods. It toughens the albumin in eggs, softens the fiber and dissolves the connective tissues in meat, softens the cellulose in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, and dissolves other substances in many foods. A good point to bear in mind in preparing foods by boiling is that slowly boiling water has the same temperature as rapidly boiling water and is therefore able to do exactly the same work. However, certain recipes may specify rapid boiling or slow boiling due to other conditions (such as not wanting to disintegrate soft food, or wanting to make use of the bubbles that appear in rapid boiling). 

Turning the stove on high, keeping the gas burning full heat, or running the fire hard to keep the water boiling rapidly is therefore unnecessary; besides, it wastes fuel without doing the work any faster and sometimes not so well. However, there are several factors that influence the rapidity with which water may be brought to the boiling point; namely, the kind of utensil used, the amount of surface exposed, and the quantity of heat applied. 

A cover placed on a saucepan or a kettle in which food is to be boiled retains the heat, and thus causes the temperature to rise more quickly; besides, a cover so used prevents a loss of water by condensing the steam as it rises against the cover. As water boils, some of it constantly passes off in the form of steam, and for this reason syrups or sauces become thicker the longer they are cooked. 

The evaporation takes place all over the surface of the water; consequently, the greater the surface exposed, the more quickly is the quantity of water decreased during boiling. Another point to observe in the boiling process is that foods boiled rapidly in water have a tendency to lose their shape and are reduced to small pieces if allowed to boil long enough.

Many recipes for pork ribs call for parboiling them before cooking, but this method is not recommended, as water is a solvent and may wash away flavors.

==Health Purposes==
Besides serving to cook foods, boiling also renders water safe, as it destroys any germs that may be present. Boiled water, as is known, loses its good taste. However, as this change is brought about by the loss of air during boiling, the flavor can be restored and air again introduced if the water is shaken in a partly filled jar or bottle, or beaten vigorously for a short time with an egg beater or whisk.</text>

== Are you sure?  ==

&quot;Boiling has various effects on foods. It toughens the albumin in eggs, '''toughens''' the fiber and dissolves the connective tissues in meat, softens the cellulose in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, and dissolves other substances in many foods.&quot;

Is that &quot;toughens&quot; or &quot;softens&quot; ?

'''Simmering''', or stewing, is a modification of boiling. By this method, food is cooked in liquid at a temperature below the boiling point, or anywhere from 185 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (85-95 Celsius). Water at the simmering point always moves gently--never rapidly as it does in boiling. Less heat and consequently less fuel are required to cook foods in this way, unless, of course, the time consumed in cooking the food at a low temperature is much greater than that consumed in cooking it more rapidly.

Aside from permitting economy in the use of fuel, simmering, or stewing, cooks deliciously certain foods that could not be selected for the more rapid methods. For example, tough cuts of meat and old fowl can be made tender and tasty by long cooking at a low temperature, for this method tends to soften the fiber and to develop an excellent flavor. Tough vegetables, too, can be cooked tender by the simmering process without using so much fuel as would be used if they were boiled, for whatever method is used they require long cooking. Beets, turnips, and other winter vegetables should be stewed rather than boiled, as it is somewhat difficult to cook them tender, especially in the late winter and early spring. If dry beans and peas are brought to the simmering point and then allowed to cook, they can be prepared for the table in practically the same length of time and without so much fuel as if they boiled continuously.</text>

[[Image:Steamers.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Metal and bamboo steamers]]
'''Steaming''' is the cooking of food by the application of steam. In this cooking process, the food is put into a steamer, which is a cooking utensil that consists of a vessel with a perforated bottom placed over one containing water. As the water boils, steam rises and cooks the food in the upper, or perforated, vessel. Steamers are sometimes arranged with a number of perforated vessels, one on top of the other. Such a steamer permits of the cooking of several foods at the same time without the need of additional fuel, because a different food may be placed in each vessel.

Steaming is preferable to boiling in some cases, because there is no loss of mineral salts nor food substances. The flavour is not so likely to be lost as when food is boiled. Some delicate fish is best cooked by steaming as it does not break up as it might in boiling water. Vegetables prepared in this way prove very palatable, and very often variety is added to the diet by steaming bread, cake, and pudding mixtures and then, provided a crisp outside is desired, placing them in a hot oven to dry out the moist surface.

'''Hominy''' - Although prepared hominy may be purchased, some people prefer to prepare it themselves. Hominy serves as a foundation from which many satisfactory dishes can be made, as it is high in food value and reasonable in cost. This cereal can be used in so many ways that it is advisable to prepare enough at one time to meet the demands of several meals. The following recipe for making hominy should provide 3 quarts of this cereal; however, as is true of other recipes--a point that should be remembered throughout the various lessons--the quantities given may be increased or decreased to meet with the requirements of the household. '''Please read the chemical-burn warning below before making hominy.''' A safer recipe, substitutes baking soda (1 tablespoon per quart of water in the first boil).

==Ingredients==
*2 qt. water
*1 Tb. food grade lye
*1 qt. shelled [[Cookbook:Maize|corn]]
*3 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
Put the water into a large kettle or saucepan, and into the water put the lye. Allow the water to come to the boiling point, and then add the corn and let it boil until the skins will slip off the grains when they are pressed between the thumb and the finger. Take from the stove, stir sufficiently to loosen the skins, and then remove them by washing the grains of corn in a coarse colander. Cover the grains with cold water and return to the fire. When the water boils, pour it off. Repeat this process at least three times, so as to make sure that there is no trace of the lye, and then allow the grains to cook in more water until they burst. Season them with the salt, and while the hominy thus prepared is still hot put it into a jar or a crock and cover it tight until it is to be used. The water in which the hominy is cooked should remain on it.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Use hominy in other recipes such as [[Cookbook:Hominy Grits|Hominy Grits]]

Adapted from {{Gutenberg|9935}}

==Warnings==
Lye is '''caustic'' and must be handled with care! Lye may cause '''serious burns'''. Before using lye, please read the article on [[w:Sodium hydroxide|Sodium Hydroxide]]. If you decide to use lye, add it gradually to the bulk of the water while stirring to dissipate the heat of solution. See also [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/uga/hominy_without_lye.html Hominy without Lye].

==Description:==

One plant flush against the right margin, spanning the page
vertically edge to edge, with branches and roots that take up the
bottom 2/3 of the page.

Two paragraphs (with 5 and 3.9 lines), left- and right-justified.
Both are interrupted by the plant's flower head.

The second paragraph is followed by a centered title-like line
which may be the true last line of the paragraph.

==Comments:==

The unusual shape of the leaves should make the plant easy to identify.

==Description:==

One plant, flush against the right and bottom edges, reaching
almost to the top.

: Root: a bundle of thin wires. Dark overpaint?

: Stem: one straight. Light color.

: Branches: two symmetrical pairs, oblique.

: Leaves: the four lower ones are medium width, lance-shaped, with smooth edges; the others have the same outline but are deeply cut into five narrow points.  Dark color.

: Stalk: short, mostly missing.

: Flowers: five, at the tips of stem and branches.

: Stalk: medium length, thin

: Chalyx: flat or everted, with short triangular sepals, partly hidden by corolla.

: Petals: five rounded petals, a large one on top, the others like &quot;arms and legs&quot;.

: Core: very small. Medium and dark colors.

Two paragraphs (with 3.7 and 7.7 lines) at the top,
left-justified. The first one is right-justified; the second one
follows the plant's profile on the right. Both are interrupted in
several places by the flowers and leaves.

==Comments:==

Petersen identifies this plant, with high confidence, as &quot;Viola
trinitalis&quot;.  I coudn't find such species, but &quot;herba trinitatis&quot; is
the herbalists' name for Viola tricolor (heartsease,wild pansy) [1,2,3].

Indeed, comparing [[f9v]] with a drawing by Carl Lindman [1], we see
an almost perfect match --- including the roots, and the two types
of leaves.

Dennis Mardle [10 Oct 1998] observes that the details match also
Viola arvensis (field pansy), which hybridises with V. tricolor
and is very similar in shape, including especially the dimorphic
leaves [1,4].

The colors may help resolve this issue. The flowers of Viola
tricolor are usually purple and white with yellow core; Lindman's
drawing shows V. arvensis as white (or light blue?) with yellow
core. Jim Reeds color list [03 Mar 1998] reports some blue on this
page, to be confirmed.

In either case, there is one odd detail: the flowers in [[f9v]] are
upside-down.  Also the two bottom flowers are somewhat differen.

Viola tricolor was used internally to treat epilepsy, asthma and
bronchitis (whole plant), as an emetic and purgative (seeds) and as
a heart tonic (flowers). Externally it was used to treat skin
diseases [2].  The flowers are reported to be edible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:enigma.jpg|thumb|325px|right|A 3-rotor Enigma machine, possibly military]]
The '''Enigma''' was an electro-mechanical rotor cypher machine used for both encryption and decryption, widely used in various forms in Europe from the early 1920s on. It is most famous for having been adopted by most German military forces from about 1930 on. Ease of use and the supposedly unbreakable cypher were the main reasons for its widespread use. The machine had two inherent weaknesses: it guaranteed that a letter would never be encrypted to itself and the rightmost rotor would rotate a set number of places before the next would rotate (26 in the initial version). In German usage the failure to replace the rotors over many years of service and patterns in messages further weakened the system. The cypher was broken, and the reading of information in the messages it didn't protect is sometimes credited with ending World War II at least a year earlier than it would have otherwise.

The counterpart British encryption machine, '''Typex''', and several American ones, e.g. the SIGABA (or M-134-C in Army use), were similar in principle to Enigma, but far more secure. The first modern rotor cypher machine, by Edward Hebern, was considerably less secure, a fact noted by William F. Friedman when it was offered to the US Government.

== History ==
Enigma was developed by Arthur Scherbius in various versions dating back to 1919. He set up a Berlin company to produce the machine, and the first commercial version (Enigma-A) was offered for sale in 1923. Three more commercial versions followed, and the Enigma-D became the most important when several copies were purchased by the Reichsmarine in 1926. The basic design was then picked up by the Army in 1929, and thereafter by practically every German military organization and by many parts of the Nazi hierarchy. In the German Navy, it was called the &quot;M&quot; machine.

Versions of Enigma were used for practically all German (and much other European Axis) radio, and often telegraph, communications throughout the war; even weather reports were encrypted with an Enigma machine. Both the Spanish (during the Civil War) and Italians (during World War II) are said to have used one of the commercial models, unchanged, for military communications. This was unwise, for the British (and one presumes, others) had succeeded in breaking the plain commercial version(s) or their equivalents. This contributed to the British defeat of a large part of the Italian fleet at Matapan.

== Operation ==

The Enigma machine was electro-mechanical, meaning it used a combination of electrical and mechanical parts. The mechanism consisted primarily of a typewriter-style keyboard, which operated electrical switches as well as a gearing mechanism.

The electrical portion consisted of a battery attached through the keys to lamps. In general terms, when a key was held down on the keyboard, one of the lamps would be lit up by the battery. In the picture to the right you can see the typewriter keys at the front of the machine, and the lights are the small (barely visible) circles &quot;above&quot; the keyboard in the middle of the machine.

The heart of the basic machine was mechanical, consisting of several connected ''rotors''. Enigma rotors in most versions consisted of flat disks with 26 contacts on each side, arranged in a circular manner around the outer faces of the disk. Every contact on one side of each disk is wired to a different contact on the other side. For instance, in a particular rotor the 1st contact on one side of the rotor might be wired to the 14th contact on the other side, the 2nd one on the first side to the 22nd on the other, and so forth. Each rotor in the set supplied with an Enigma was wired differently than the others, and the German military/party models used different rotor wirings than did any of the commercial models.

Inside the machine were three slots (in most variants) into which the rotors could be placed. The rotors were &quot;stacked&quot; in the slots in such a way that the contacts on the &quot;output&quot; side of one rotor were in contact with the &quot;input&quot; contacts on the next. The third rotor in most versions was connected to a ''reflector'' (unique to the Enigma family amongst the various rotor machines designed in the period) which was hard wired to feed outputs of the third rotor back into different contacts of the third rotor, thence back to the first rotor, but by a different route. In the picture you can see the three stacked rotors at the very top of the machine, with teeth protruding from the panel surface which allow the rotors to be turned by hand.

When a key was pressed on the keyboard, current from the battery flowed from the switch controlled by that key, say A, into a position on the first rotor. There it would travel through the rotor's internal wiring to, say, the J position on the other side. It would then go into the next rotor, perhaps turned such that the first rotor's J was lined up with the second's X. From there it would travel to the other side of the second rotor, and so on. Because the signal had travelled through the rotors and back, some other letter than A would light in the lamp array &amp;ndash; thus substituting one letter for another, the fundamental mechanism in all substitution cypher systems.

Because the rotors changed position (rather like an automobile odometer) with every key press, A might be Q this time, but the next A would be something different, perhaps T. After 26 letters were pressed, a cam on the rotor advanced the rotor in the next slot by one position. The substitution alphabet thus changed with every plaintext letter, and kept changing with every plaintext letter for a very long time.

Better yet, due to the &quot;random&quot; wiring of each rotor, the exact sequence of these substitution alphabets varied depending on the initial position of the rotors, their installed order, and which rotors were installed in the machine. These settings were referred to as the ''initial settings'', and were given out in books once a month (to start with -- they became more frequent later on).

The most common versions of the machine were symmetrical in the sense that decipherment works in the same way as encypherment: type in the cyphertext and the sequence of lit lamps will correspond to the plaintext. However, this works only if the decyphering machine has the same configuration (i.e., initial settings) as had the encrypting machine (rotor sequence, wiring, alphabet ring settings, and initial positions); these changed regularly (at first monthly, then weekly, then daily and even more often nearer the end of the War on some networks) and were specified in key schedules distributed to Enigma users.

'''Braising''' (from the French &quot;braiser&quot;) is cooking with &quot;moist heat,&quot; typically in a covered pot with a small amount of liquid which results in a particular flavor.

Braising relies on heat, time, and moisture to successfully break down tough connective tissue and collagens in meat. It is an ideal way to cook tougher cuts. Many classic braised dishes such as Coq au Vin are highly-evolved methods of cooking otherwise tough and unpalatable foods.  Swissing, stewing and pot-roasting are all braising types.

Most braises follow the same basic steps. The meat or poultry is first browned in hot fat.  Aromatic vegetables are sometimes then browned as well. A cooking liquid that often includes an acidic element, such as tomatoes or wine, is added to the pot, which is covered. The dish cooks in relatively low heat in an oven or atop the stove until the meat is fork-tender. Often the cooking liquid is finished to create a sauce or gravy.

A successful braise intermingles the flavors of the foods being cooked and the cooking liquid. Also, the dissolved collagens and gelatins from the meat enrich and add body to the liquid. Braising is economical, as it allows the use of tough and inexpensive cuts, and efficient, as it often employs a single pot to cook an entire meal.  

Familiar braised dishes include Murshed, pot roast, beef stew, Swiss steak, chicken cacciatore, goulash, braised tilapia and beef bourguignon, among others. Braising is also used extensively in the cuisines of Asia, particularly Chinese cuisine. Vegetables can also be braised.  Glazed carrots are an example of a quick-braise, one which is done for a short period of time.

'''Sautéing''' is cooking food in a small quantity of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. When sautéing, which is a type of [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]], a very small amount of oil is placed in a shallow pan, and when it is sufficiently hot, the food is put into it. Foods that are to be sautéed are usually sliced thin or cut into small pieces, and they are sometimes turned frequently during the process of cooking.  Sauté is French for &quot;jumping&quot;, used to describe the action of the food in the pan.

The term ''pan-frying'' is sometimes the English equivalent of ''sautéing'' (which is a French word) if only a very small amount of oil is used.  Some people consider it a different technique, which uses more fat and takes longer.  [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|Stir-frying]] uses higher temperatures and continual stirring.  With modern non-stick pans the amount of oil required can be quite small, or even omitted.

== Tips for Proper Technique ==
While different ingredients will call for variations in this technique, there are some general guidelines to help ensure an ideal outcome.

===Mise en place===
The first rule is be prepared.  If your recipe calls for chopped ingredients in step 12, make sure you have them chopped now.  While experienced cooks will successfully chop the next ingredient while the rest are cooking, this is not a path to follow for the inexperienced.  For one thing, chopping times for the experienced cook are generally much shorter, so the cooking food doesn't have a chance to burn.  For another, the experienced cook can quickly assess whether food is done.  A less experienced cook should be much more attentive to the pan to become more familiar with the stages of &quot;doneness&quot;.

The pan is hot enough if a few small drops of water flicked from your fingertips vaporise immediately, or if a larger drop of water hisses and floats across the surface of the pan on a cushion of its own steam.  

===Use the fond===
When sautéing cuts of meat, many recipes will call for you to deglaze the pan with a flavorful liquid (e.g. stock, wine, spirits, or even fruit juices).  The dark brown bits of meat left behind from the high heat cooking are called &quot;fond&quot; and are as intensely flavored as pan drippings from roasted meats.  These should generally be scraped off the bottom of the pan and dissolved into the deglazing liquid.  In especially elegant preparations, the pan sauce created is strained to remove the solid bits, leaving only the dissolved flavorings in a smooth sauce.

===When using garlic and onion===
When sautéing with both onions and garlic, be sure to sauté the onions first until they are clear, then add the garlic, and continue to sauté until it is pale gold.  The onion takes longer to cook, thus if both are added at the same time, the garlic will be browned by the time the onion is done, which results in an undesirable dominant pungency.  Garlic will add its flavour much more harmoniously when only sautéed to a pale gold.

'''Frying''' is the cooking of food in fat. This takes several forms, from ''deep-frying'', where the food is completely immersed in hot oil, to ''sautéing'' where food is cooked in a frying pan where there is only a thin coating of oil.  Frying is the fastest way to cook, as it is the most efficient way to transfer heat into the food.  Despite using liquid oil, frying is considered to be a dry cooking method as water is not used in the cooking process and ideally the cooking oil will not be absorbed by the food, thus no moisture is added by cooking.

From the method using the most oil to the least, the types of frying are:

*[[Cookbook:Deep frying|Deep frying]] (also known as immersion frying)
*[[Cookbook:Pan frying|Pan frying]]
*[[Cookbook:Stir-frying|Stir-frying]]
*[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sautéing]]

==European ovens and grilling==
I propose to (eventually) change this article to reflect the fact that most European ovens include a grill. Also, grilling is usually considered a healthy option because fat released from the cooking food cannot be reabsorbed. This tends to contradict the article's assertion that it is used to retain the juices of meat. [[User:LittlePete|LittlePete]] 11:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is there evidence for the searing claim==
Given that this post contradicts the long standing advice from many cooks that one should sear a steak at high temperature to retain the juices first not last, is there any reference to back up this interesting claim to do the opposite?

'''Broiling''' or '''Grilling''' is the use of radiant heat for cooking, usually called [[Cookbook:Broiling|grilling]] in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British]] and Australian English and broiling in US English. Typically this is done in an electric [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], using only the upper heating element, with the door partially open. Gas ovens often provide a  very effective lower drawer for broiling.  Gas ovens, in a way analogous to gas ranges, provide a hotter, flame-based heat source that is preferred by most cooks over electric broilers.  This is where the term &quot;flame broiled&quot; comes from.

Broiling is used to retain the juices of [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] while developing flavor. Broiling does not soften the fibers of tough meat. It is best used for tender meat, including [[Cookbook:Poultry|poultry]]. Broiling is not the most economical way of cooking, and the browning of meat can create carcinogenic (albeit tasty) chemicals.

The food should be exposed to intense heat last, to ensure even cooking and less juice escaping. How does that work? Heat damages surface proteins that keep the juice in. The higher the heat, the more damage. So, contrary to popular belief, searing before cooking through will '''''NOT''''' lock in the juices. The food that is being broiled should be turned just once. Once the outside is browned, the heat may need to be reduced to ensure that the center will cook before the outside burns.</text>

Nothing more delicious in the way of cake can be made than '''sunshine cake'''. It is especially nice to serve with a frozen dessert of some kind, for it is not too rich and it is attractive in color.

==Ingredients==
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/3 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon juice]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

==Procedure==
Separate the eggs. Beat the yolks with a rotary beater until they are thick and lemon-colored. Beat the egg whites until they are foamy, add the cream of tartar, and continue beating until they are dry. Fold the sugar into the egg whites and then fold the yolks into this mixture. Sift the flour several times and add it. Add the lemon juice and vanilla, pour into a sponge-cake pan, and bake.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Berni. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Berni~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Nutritional yeast is a cooking yeast derived from a fungus, saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is sold in in powder and flake form, and is used most often in vegetarian and vegan cuisine to simulate creamy sauces such as fake cheese, but is also used as a general condiment.

Nutritional yeast is high in B vitamins and folic acid, and tastes sweet, salty and slightly nutty.

Nutritional yeast flakes are most commonly found for sale in bulk at natural or health food stores.</text>

== Vile - vi like Emacs ==
{{Wikipedia|VILE}}

=== Overview ===

'''vile''' is a vi clone which doesn't claim to be a vi clone. The idea behind vile is to have an editor which works similar to vi but provides features for editing multiple files in multiple window-areas like emacs. In fact, vile development started by using MicroEMACS as the base, and not a vi clone, and also not full blown Emacs. MicroEMACS is an emacs-like editor (MicroEMACS's author didn't like full-blown emacs, and the vile authors didn't like (Micro)EMACS mode-less way of working). So vile was developed.

vile provides the most common vi commands (as used by their authors), but not all vi commands. The implemented commands are supposed to work more or less like the original vi commands. The window management and buffer management came from MicroEMACS.

Much work has gone into the vile documentation after the first versions were almost undocumented. It is recommended to consult the documentation to find out the differences and extensions of vile, compared to vi.

'''If you are a beginner, please consider [[Programming Mac OS X with Cocoa for Beginners]]'''

== About Cocoa ==
Cocoa is the name Apple Computer uses for their extended implementation of the OpenStep specification, first created by NeXT for their OPENSTEP operating system. It provides a useful set of tools to help developers create programs and user interfaces within Mac OS X. There are three implementations of the OpenStep specification, the one originally provided with the OPENSTEP operating system, but the most common ones today are the one provided by Apple, and the other by GNUstep, a free software implementation of OpenStep.

If you don't have access to an Apple Macintosh, and you would like to learn how to use the OPENSTEP frameworks, then running GNUstep is worth a consideration (and should be sufficient to let you experience the power of the OPENSTEP frameworks).

==  Getting ready to program ==
If you are using an Apple Macintosh computer running Mac OS 10.2 or later (the latest version of Mac OS X is recommended) then you can find all the tools needed to develop Cocoa programs on the last software install CD.  The tools are also available from [http://developer.apple.com/ Apple's Developer's Website].  In order to download them, you need to create a free account and login. You can also find them in the &quot;Installers&quot; folder of your &quot;Applications&quot; folder (they could be outdated, make sure you run software update after the installation). The two programs you will use most extensively are Xcode (known as Project Builder in versions before 10.3) and Interface Builder.

If you are using GNUstep then you may already have the tools installed. The programs you will need to complete most of the tutorials in this book are [http://gnustep.org/experience/ProjectCenter.html ProjectCenter] and [http://gnustep.org/experience/Gorm.html Gorm]. You will need to refer to the GNUstep website for help installing these.

Before starting any of the modules that make up this book you should have a good, basic knowledge of the [[Programming:C|C programming language]]. C will help you understand programming in general.

It would be advantageous for you to learn [[Programming:Objective-C|Objective-C]] as well, as it is the core language for developing Cocoa applications, and may help to assist in understanding the machinery behind Cocoa applications. Learning Objective-C while learning Cocoa is also possible.

This module will walk you through the process of creating your first Cocoa application.

This module is intended to help you become comfortable with the basics of the tools you will be using and will not go into great detail about them.

The application you will write will take two numbers entered by the user via a graphical user interface and will multiply them together. The product of the two numbers will be sent to the graphical user interface.

== Starting ==
The first thing you need to do is start Xcode. Xcode should be located in /Developer/Applications (the Applications folder inside the Developer folder on your hard-drive). We'll be using Xcode a lot in coming modules so you might like to add it to your Dock now.

Launch Xcode by double clicking its icon.

== Creating a project ==
Once Xcode has started you are ready to create your project.

From the file menu choose &quot;New Project&quot;. The following dialog box will appear.

[[Image:Cocoa_project_type.png]]

Select &quot;Cocoa Application&quot; and click &quot;Next&quot;. A dialog box will appear asking you to name your project.

[[Image:Cocoa_application_name.png]]

Call your project &quot;Multiply&quot; and click &quot;Finish&quot;. Xcode will then create your project and set up some starting files for you. Once this is done the following window should appear and we are ready to get started.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_nib_selected.png]]

== Building the Interface ==
Since your application is going to be quite simple you can jump right in and build the user interface! Click the small arrow next to &quot;NIB files&quot; and double click on &quot;MainMenu.nib&quot;. This will start Interface Builder, a helpful program that you use to assemble graphical user interfaces. Once Interface Builder has started you will have windows similar to the following on your screen. Don't worry if the windows look slightly different or are positioned differently.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_interface_builder.png|thumb|left|400px|The Interface Builder interface]]

The first thing your interface needs is a way for the user to enter the two numbers to multiply. A basic textbox is appropriate for this purpose. Click on the &quot;Cocoa-Text&quot; tab of the interface elements palette. From this tab you should drag a basic text box onto the applications window. When dragging interface elements around dotted blue lines will sometimes appear. These lines help you position elements according to the Apple Human Interface guidelines. Position the textbox near the top left of the window as shown in the next diagram.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_nstextbox_construction.png]]

Once the first textbox is in position you should add another to hold the second number that will be entered by the user and a third to hold the product. Your window should look something like the following.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_textfields.png]]

Right now your window has nothing to explain to the user what it does! It needs some labels. From the interface elements palette drag a label into your applications window (the label element is the one that says &quot;System Font Text&quot;). Once this is in your window double click it and change it to read &quot;x&quot; drag its right border as far left as it can go and place it between the first two textfields. Create another label that reads &quot;=&quot; and place it between the last two text fields. Your application should now look something like the following.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_labled_text_fields.png]]

Now your application needs a way to activate the multiplication. Choose the &quot;Cocoa-Controls&quot; tab of the interface elements palette and drag a button into your applications window. place it below the right textfield. Double click the button and change its text to read &quot;Calculate&quot;. Since this is the last item we will be adding to our interface you might like to also resize the window so that it doesn't have so much extra space. Your window should now look something like the following.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_complete_window.png]]

But how do these items work together? At the moment the textfields and button aren't connected in any way. We will connect them to an controller object that we shall now create. Click on the &quot;Classes&quot; tab of the &quot;MainMenu.nib&quot; window and choose &quot;NSObject&quot; (it's all the way to the left). With NSObject selected choose &quot;Subclass NSObject&quot; from the &quot;Classes&quot; menu.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_subclass_nsobject.png]]

Call the new class &quot;MultiplyController&quot;. With the new MultiplyController selected choose &quot;Instantiate MultiplyController&quot; from the &quot;Classes&quot; Menu. This will create an instance of the class to which we can connect interface elements.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_instantiate_multiplycontroller.png]]

Now when you look at the &quot;Instances&quot; tab of the &quot;MainMenu.nib&quot; window you will see the instance of the MultiplyController class. Before we can connect the interface elements to the controller we have to give the controller outlets and actions. Outlets are connections to interface elements e.g. textfields and actions are methods that that can be called by interface elements e.g. when a button is pressed.

Click on &quot;MultiplyController&quot; in the &quot;Classes&quot; tab and then choose &quot;Show Info&quot; (or &quot;Show Inspector&quot; if you are running Tiger) from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu. Click the &quot;Outlets&quot; tab of the Info window then click &quot;Add&quot;. Call the new outlet &quot;firstNumber&quot;. Add two more outlets called &quot;secondNumber&quot; and &quot;product&quot;.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_adding_outlets.png]]

In the &quot;Actions&quot; tab click &quot;Add&quot; and call the new action &quot;Multiply&quot;.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_adding_actions.png]]

Now you need to connect all the parts up. To do this you need to click on the &quot;Instances&quot; tab of the &quot;MainMenu.nib&quot; window. Then hold down control on your keyboard and drag from the instance of &quot;MultiplyController&quot; to the first textfield in your application window. A blue line will appear showing the connection you are making. Once you have reached the first textfield stop dragging and the info window will show you the possible outlets to connect. Choose &quot;firstNumber&quot; and then click &quot;Connect&quot;.  The screenshot shows the situation just after the connection has been made, hence the button in the inspector window now shows &quot;disconnect&quot;,  and there is a ball next to the firstNumber outlet showing that it is the target of the connection illustrated by the illustration on the left.

[[Image:Cocoa_basics_connecting_outlets.png]]

Do the same for the &quot;secondNumber&quot; outlet and the second textfield. And finally connect the right textfield to the &quot;product&quot; outlet. Now we need to connect up the &quot;Calculate&quot; button to the multiply action of MultiplyController. This is also done by control+dragging but this time you start at the button and drag to the class instance. This is because this the message to do the multiplication needs to flow from the button to the controller.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_connecting_action.png]]

Now that you have your actions and outlets hooked up you can save your work in Interface Builder. But before you leave Interface Builder there is one more thing you should do. Select &quot;MultiplyController&quot; in the &quot;Classes&quot; tab of the &quot;Main Menu.nib&quot; window. and then choose &quot;Create Files for MultiplyController&quot; from the &quot;Classes&quot; menu.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_create_files_for_controller.png]]

In the sheet which appears you should make sure the both &quot;MultiplyController.h&quot; and &quot;MultiplyController.m&quot; are checked then click &quot;Choose&quot;

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_created_files_for_controller.png]]

You can then save any changes you have made and quit Interface Builder.

== Writing the code ==
With the interface now completed you can write the code for the MultiplyController class. Make sure you have Xcode selected and click &quot;Other Sources&quot;. The sources for your application will now be displayed on the right. Double click on &quot;MultiplyController.m&quot; to open it for editing.

Currently its contents are: &lt;!-- the non breaking spaces are used to allow blank lines in the preformatted text --&gt;
 #import &quot;MultiplyController.h&quot;
 &amp;nbsp;
 @implementation MultiplyController
 &amp;nbsp;
 - (IBAction)multiply:(id)sender
 {
 }
 &amp;nbsp;
 @end
If you don't understand this then you might need to read through [[Programming:Objective-C]].

What we need is for the &quot;multiply:&quot; method to get the two numbers, multiply them together, and place the product in the result textfield. To do this change the method to the following.

 - (IBAction)multiply:(id)sender
 {
     [product setIntValue:[firstNumber intValue] * [secondNumber intValue]];
 }

If you understand Objective-C this should make sense to you. If not you should read [[Programming:Objective-C]].

Save &quot;MultiplyController.m&quot; and close it. Choose &quot;Build and Run&quot; from the &quot;Build&quot; menu. Assuming you didn't make any errors the application should run. Type in some numbers and press calculate.

[[Image:Cocoa_first_steps_running_multiply.png]]

== Exercises ==
# Currently the multiply application works with integers. Modify the code so that it works with floats.
# Modify the interface to make the application update when you change the contents of one of the text boxes.

'''Tater Tot Casserole''' - Another easy and tasty casserole.

==Ingredients==
*1-2 lbs. [[Cookbook:Beef|ground beef]]
*1 can cream of mushroom soup OR cream of chicken soup
*1/2 bag of [[Cookbook:Tater Tots|tater tots]] (approximately)

==Procedure==
#Brown hamburger and drain.
#Mix in cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup.
#Put mixture in casserole dish and cover the top with one layer of tater tots.
#Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until done.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Try adding peas or other vegetables.  A can of cheddar cheese soup is also a great way to make a meaty, cheesy casserole!  Shortly before the dish is ready, sprinkle the top with some grated cheddar cheese also.

== The Classic Unix C APIs for Serial Communication ==

=== Introduction ===

==== Scope ====
This page is about the classic Unix C APIs for controlling serial devices. Languages other than C might provide appropriate wrappers to these APIs which look similar, or come with their own abstraction (e.g. [[../Serial_Java|Java]]). Nevertheless, these APIs are the lowest level of abstraction one can find for serial I/O in Unix. And, in fact they are also the highest abstraction in C on standard Unix. Some Unix versions ship additional vendor-specific proprietary high-level APIs. These APIs are not discussed here.

Actual implementations of classic Unix serial APIs do vary in practice, due to the different versions of Unix and its clones, like Linux. Therefore, this module just provides a general outline. It is highly recommended that you study a particular Unix
version's manual (man pages) when programming for a serial device in Unix. The relevant man pages are not too great a read, but they are usually complete in their listing of options and parameters. Together with this overview it should be possible to implement programs doing serial I/O under Unix.

==== Basics ====
Linux, or any Unix, is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system. As such, programs usually don't, and are usually not allowed to, access hardware resources like serial UARTs directly. Instead, the operating system provides

# low-level drivers for mapping the device into the file system (&lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt; and/or &lt;tt&gt;/device/&lt;/tt&gt; file system entries),
# the standard system calls for opening, reading, writing, and closing the device, and
# the standard system call for controlling a device, and/or
# high-level C libraries for controlling the device.

The low-level driver not only maps the device into the file system with the help of the kernel, it also encapsulates the particular hardware. The user often does not even know or care what type of UART is in use.

Classic Unix systems often provide two different device nodes (or minor numbers) for serial I/O hardware. These provide access to the same physical device via two different names in the &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt; hierarchy. Which node is used affects how certain serial control signals, such as DCD (data carrier detect), are handled when the device is opened. In some cases this can be changed programmatically, making the difference largely irrelevant. As a consequence, Linux only provides the different devices for legacy programs.

Device names in the file system can vary, even on the same Unix system, as they are simply aliases. The important parts of a device name (such as in &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt;) are the major and minor numbers. The major number distinguishes a serial port, for example, from a keyboard driver, and is used to select the correct driver in the kernel. Note that the major number differs between different Unix systems. The minor number is interpreted by the device driver itself. For serial device drivers, it is typically used to detect which physical interface to use. Sometimes, the minor number will also be used by the device driver to determine the DCD behavior or the hardware flow control signals to be used.

The typical (but not standardized, see above) device names under Unix for serial interfaces are:

; /dev/tty''xxx''
: Normal, generic access to the device. Used for terminal and other serial communication (originally for '''t'''ele'''ty'''pes). More recently, they are also used in modem communication, for example, whereas the &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cua''xxx''&lt;/tt&gt; was used on older systems.
: See the following module on how terminal I/O and serial I/O relate on Unix.

; /dev/cua''xxx''
: Legacy device driver with special DCD handling. Typically this was used for accessing a modem on old Unix systems, such as running the [[wikipedia:UUCP|UUCP]] communication protocol over the serial line and the modem. The ''cu'' in the name stands for the [[#&lt;tt&gt;cu&lt;/tt&gt;]] program. The ''a'' for ACU (automatic call unit).

The '''xxx''' part in the names above is typically a one or two digit number, or a lowercase letter, starting at 'a' for the first interface.

PC-based Unix systems often mimic the DOS/Windows naming for the devices and call them &lt;tt&gt;/dev/com''xxx''&lt;/tt&gt;. Linux system generally call serial ports &lt;tt&gt;/dev/ttyS''xxx''&lt;/tt&gt; instead.

To summarize, when programming for the serial interface of a Unix system it is '''highly advisable''' to provide complete configuration for the device name. Not even the typical &lt;tt&gt;/dev&lt;/tt&gt; path should be hard coded.

Note, devices with the name &lt;tt&gt;/dev/pty''xxx''&lt;/tt&gt; are pseudo terminal devices, typically used by a graphical user interface to provide a terminal emulator like ''xterm'' or ''dtterm'' with a &quot;terminal&quot; device, and to provide a terminal device for network logins. There is no serial hardware behind these device drivers.

=== Serial I/O via Terminal I/O {{stage short|75%|Jul 23, 2005}} ===
==== Basics ====
Serial I/O under Unix is implemented as part of the terminal I/O capabilities of Unix. And the terminal I/O capabilities of Unix were originally the typewriter/teletype capabilities. Terminal I/O is not limited to terminals, though. The terminal I/O API is used for communication with many serial devices other than terminals, such as modems and printers.

The terminal API itself has evolved over time. These days three terminal APIs are still used in Unix programs and can be found in recent Unix implementations. A fourth one, the very old one from Unix Version 6 exists, but is quite rare these days.

The three common ones are:

# V7, 4BSD, XENIX style device-specific [[Serial_Programming:Serial_Linux#V7 / ioctl(2)|ioctl-based API]],
# An old one called [[Serial_Programming:Serial_Linux#termio / ioctl(2)|termio]]
# A newer one (although still already a few decades old), which is called [[Serial_Programming:Serial_Linux#termios|termios]] (note the additional 's'). 

The newer &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt; API is based on the older &lt;tt&gt;termio&lt;/tt&gt; API, and so the two &lt;tt&gt;termio...&lt;tt&gt; APIs share a lot of similarities. The &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt; API has also undergone changes since inception. For example, the method of specifying the baud rate has changed from using pre-defined constants to a more relaxed schema (the constants can still be used as well on most implementations).
 
Systems that support the newer &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt; often also support the older &lt;tt&gt;termio&lt;/tt&gt; API, either by providing it in addition, or by providing a &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt; implementation with data structures which can be used in place of the &lt;tt&gt;termio&lt;/tt&gt; data structures and work as &lt;tt&gt;termio&lt;/tt&gt;. These systems also often just provide one man page under the older name '''termio'''''(7)'' which is then in fact the &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt; man page, too.

In addition, some systems provide other, similar APIs, either in addition or as a replacement. &lt;tt&gt;termiox&lt;/tt&gt; is such an API, which is largely compatible with &lt;tt&gt;termio&lt;/tt&gt; and adds some extensions to it taken from &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt;. So &lt;tt&gt;termiox&lt;/tt&gt; can logically be seen as an intermediate step between &lt;tt&gt;termio&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt;. 

The terminal I/O APIs rely on the standard system calls for reading and writing data. They don't provide their own reading/writing functions. Reading and writing data is done via the '''read'''''(2)'' and '''write'''''(2)'' system calls. The terminal I/O APIs just add functions for controlling and configuring the device. Most of this happens via the '''ioctl'''''(2)'' system call.

Unfortunately, whichever of the standard APIs is used, one fact holds for all of them: They are a slight mess. Well, not really. Communication with terminals was and is a difficult issue, and the APIs reflect these difficulties. But due to the fact that one can do &quot;everything&quot; with the APIs, it is overwhelming when one &quot;just&quot; wants to do some serial communication. So why is there no separate serial-I/O-only API in Unix? There are probably two reasons for this:

# Terminals/teletypes were the first, and apparently very important, serial devices which were connected to Unix. So that API was created first.
# Once the API was there, there was no need to create a separate one for serial I/O only, since a large part of terminal I/O is serial I/O, and all needed features were already there in the terminal I/O API.

So which API should one use? There is one good reason to use the old V7 API. It is the simplest among the APIs - after going through some initialization woes on modern Unix systems. In general, however, the newer &lt;tt&gt;termios&lt;/tt&gt; API makes the most sense, although it is the most complex one.

==== Line Discipline ====

When programming serial interfaces on Unix, there is one phrase - ''line discipline'' - which can drive programmers crazy. The line discipline provides the hardware-independent interface for the communication between the computer and the terminal device. It handles such things as editing, job control, and special character interpretation, and performs transformations on the incoming and outgoing data.

This is useful for terminal communication (e.g. when a backspace character should erase the latest character from the send buffer before it goes over the wire, or when different end-of-line character sequences between the terminal and the computer need to be converted). These features are, however, hardly useful when communicating with the plethora of other serial devices, where unaltered data communication is desired.

Much of the serial programming in Unix is hitting the line discipline which is in use over the head so it doesn't touch the data. Monitoring what actually goes over the wire is a good idea.

=== Unix V6/PWB ===

Unix ''Bell Version 6'' with the ''programmer's workbench'' (PWB) was released in 1975 to universities. It was the first Unix with an audience outside AT&amp;T. It already had a terminal programming API. Actually, at that point it was the ''typewriter'' API. That API is not described here in depth.

The usage of this API can in theory be identified by the presence of the following signature in some source code:

 #include &lt;sgtty.h&gt;
 stty(fd, data)
 int fd;
 char *data;&lt;br&gt;
 gtty(fd, data)
 int fd;
 char *data;

In theory, because at that time the C language was still a little bit different.

&lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; is supposed to point to a 

 struct {
    char ispeed, ospeed;
    char erase, kill;
    int  mode;
 } *data;

structure. That structure later became &lt;code&gt;struct sgttyb&lt;/code&gt; in Unix V7. Finding the V6 API in source code should be rare. Anyhow, recent Unix versions and clones typically don't support this API any more.

=== Unix V7 ===

See [[Serial Programming:Unix/V7]]

=== termios ===

&lt;code&gt;termios&lt;/code&gt; is the API that is in general recommended for serial I/O in Unix. A simple terminal program with &lt;code&gt;termios&lt;/code&gt; can look like it follows. Please note this program is not intended as a general framework for own programs. It lacks error handling, doesn't buffer data, and uses very inefficient polling, wasting lot of CPU cycles. The program just demonstrates some basics for serial I/O:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;termios.h&gt;

int main(int argc,char** argv)
{
        struct termios tio;
        struct termios stdio;
        struct termios old_stdio;
        int tty_fd;

        unsigned char c='D';
        tcgetattr(STDOUT_FILENO,&amp;old_stdio);

        printf(&quot;Please start with %s /dev/ttyS1 (for example)\n&quot;,argv[0]);
        memset(&amp;stdio,0,sizeof(stdio));
        stdio.c_iflag=0;
        stdio.c_oflag=0;
        stdio.c_cflag=0;
        stdio.c_lflag=0;

== Serial I/O on the Shell Command Line {{stage short|75%|Jul 23, 2005}} ==

=== Introduction ===

It is possible to do serial I/O on the Unix command line. However, the available control is limited. Reading and writing data can be done with the shell I/O redirections like '''&lt;''', '''&gt;''', and '''|'''. Setting basic configuration, like the baud rate, can be done with the &lt;tt&gt;stty&lt;/tt&gt; (set terminal type) command.

There is also &lt;tt&gt;libserial&lt;/tt&gt; for Linux.  It's a simple C++ class which
hides some of the complexity of termios.

=== Configuration with &lt;tt&gt;stty&lt;/tt&gt; ===

The Unix command &lt;tt&gt;stty&lt;/tt&gt; allows one to configure a &quot;terminal&quot;. Since all serial I/O under Unix is done via terminal I/O, it should be no surprise that stty can also be used to configure serial lines. Indeed, the options and parameters which can be set via stty often have a 1:1 mapping to termio/termios. If the explanations regarding an option in the '''stty'''''(1)'' man page is not sufficient, looking up the option in the termio/termios man page can often help.

On &quot;modern&quot; (System V) Unix versions, stty changes the parameters of its current '''standard input'''. On older systems, stty changes the parameters of its current '''standard output'''. We assume a modern Unix is in use here. So, to change the settings of a particular serial interface, its device name must be provided to stty via an I/O redirect:

 stty ''parameters'' &lt; /dev/com0  # change setting of /dev/com0

On some systems, the settings done by stty are reverted to system defaults as soon as the device is closed again. This closing is done by the shell as soon as the &lt;tt&gt;stty ''parameters'' &lt; /dev/com0&lt;/tt&gt; command has finished. So when using the above command, the changes will only be in effect for a few milliseconds.

One way to keep the device open for the duration of the communication is to start the whole communication in a sub shell (using, for example, '( ... )'), and redirecting that input. So to send the string &quot;ATI0&quot; over the serial line, one could use:

 ( stty ''parameters''
   echo &quot;ATI0&quot;
 ) &lt; /dev/com0 &gt; /dev/com0
   
Interweaving sending and receiving data is difficult from the command line. Two processes are needed; one reading from the device, and the other writing to the device. This makes it difficult to coordinate commands sent with the responses received. Some extensive shell scripting might be needed to manage this.

A common way to organize the two processes is to put the reading process in the background, and let the writing process continue to run in the foreground. For example, the following script configures the device and starts a background process for copying all received data from the serial device to standard output. Then it starts writing commands to the device:

 # Set up device and read from it.
 # Capture PID of background process so it is possible
 # to terminate background process once writing is done
 # TODO: Also set up a trap in case script is killed
 #       or crashes.
 ( stty ''parameters''; cat; )&amp; &lt; /dev/com0
 bgPid=$?&lt;br&gt;
 # Read commands from user, send them to device
 while read cmd; do
    echo &quot;$cmd&quot; 
 done &gt;/dev/com0&lt;br /&gt;
 # Terminate background read process
 kill $bgPid

If there is a chance that a response to some command might never come, and if there is no other way to terminate the process, it is advisable to set up a timeout by using the alarm signal and &lt;code&gt;trap&lt;/code&gt; that signal (signal 14), or simply kill the process:

 trap timeout 14
 timeout() {
    echo &quot;timeout occurred&quot;
 }
 pid=$$
 ( sleep 60 ; kill -14 $pid; )&amp; # send alarm signal after 60 sec.
 # normal script contents goes here
or
 pid=$$
 ( sleep 60; kill -9 $pid;)&amp; # brutally kill process after 60 sec.
 # normal script contents goes here

=== Permanent Configuration ===

==== Overview ====
It is possible to provide a serial line with a default configuration. On classic Unix this is done with entries in the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ttytab&lt;/tt&gt; configuration file, on newer (System V R4) systems with &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ttydefs&lt;/tt&gt;.

The default configurations make some sense when they are used for setting up terminal lines or dialup lines for a Unix system (and that's what they are for). However, such default configurations are not of much use when doing some serial communication with some other device. The correct function of the communication program should better not depend on some operating system configuration. Instead, the application should be self-contained and configure the device as needed by it.

==== &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ttytab&lt;/tt&gt; ====

The ttytab format varies from Unix to Unix, so checking the corresponding man page is a good idea. If the device is not intended for a terminal (no login), then the ''getty'' field (sometimes also called the program field, usually the 3rd field) for the device entry should be empty. The init field (often the 4th field) can contain an initialization command. Using &lt;tt&gt;stty&lt;/tt&gt; here is a good idea. So, a typical entry for a serial line might look like:

  # Device    TermType    Getty   Init
  tty0        unknown     &quot;&quot;      &quot;stty ''parameters''&quot;

==== &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ttydefs&lt;/tt&gt; ====

{{sectstub}}Just some hints:

&lt;tt&gt;/etc/ttydefs&lt;/tt&gt; provides the configuration as used by the '''ttymon''' program. The settings are similar to the settings possible with stty. 

&lt;tt&gt;ttymon&lt;/tt&gt; is a program which is typically run under control of the Service Access Controller (SAC), as part of the Service Access Facility (SAF).

''TODO: Provide info to set up all the sac/sacadm junk.''

==== &lt;tt&gt;/etc/serial.conf&lt;/tt&gt; ====

{{sectstub}}Just some hints:

A Linux-specific way of configuring serial devices using the '''setserial''' program.

=== &lt;tt&gt;tty&lt;/tt&gt; ===

tty with the '''-s''' option can be used to test if a device is a terminal (supports the termio/termios ioctl()'s). Therefore it can also be used to check if a given file name is indeed a device name of a serial line.

 echo &quot;Enter serial device name: \c&quot;
 read dev
 if tty -s &lt; &quot;$dev&quot;; then
   echo &quot;$dev is indeed a serial device.&quot;
 else
   echo &quot;$dev is not a serial device.&quot;
 fi

=== &lt;tt&gt;tip&lt;/tt&gt; ===

It is a simple program for establishing a terminal connection with a remote system over a serial line. &lt;tt&gt;tip&lt;/tt&gt; takes the necessary communication parameters, including the parameters for the serial communication, from a tip-specific configuration file. Details can be found in the &lt;tt&gt;tip&lt;/tt&gt;''(1)'' manual page.

Example:

To start the session over the first serial interface (here &lt;tt&gt;ttya&lt;/tt&gt;):

 tip -9600 /dev/ttya

To leave the session:

 ~.

=== &lt;tt&gt;uucp&lt;/tt&gt; ===

==== Overview ====
Uucp (Unix-to-Unix-Copy) is a set of programs for moving data over serial lines/modems between Unix computers. Before the rise of the Internet uucp was the heart and foundation of services like e-mail and Usenet (net news) between Unix computers. Today uucp is largely insignificant. However, it is still a good choice if two or more Unix systems should be connected via serial lines/modems.

The uucp suite also contains command line tools for login over a serial line (or another UUCP bearer to a remote system. These tools are &lt;tt&gt;cu&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ct&lt;/tt&gt;. They are e.g. useful when trying to access a device connected via a serial line and when debugging some serial line protocol.

==== &lt;tt&gt;cu&lt;/tt&gt; ====

&lt;tt&gt;cu&lt;/tt&gt; &quot;call another UNIX system&quot;, does what the name implies. Only, that the other system does not have to be a UNIX system at all. It just sets up a serial connection, possibly by dialing via a modem.

&lt;tt&gt;cu&lt;/tt&gt; is the oldest Unix program for serial communication. It's the reason why some serial devices on classic Unix systems are called something like &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cul0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/dev/cua0&lt;/tt&gt;. Where ''cu'' of course stands for the &lt;tt&gt;cu&lt;/tt&gt; program supposed to use the devices, ''l'' stands for ''line'' - the communication line, and ''a'' for acu (automatic call unit).

{{NOTE|note=An ACU is kind of a modem. Modern modems work slightly different and don't provide separate serial interfaces for dialing and communicating with the remote side. Instead they do both over the same serial interface, using some kind of inband signaling. See [[Serial Programming:Modems and AT Commands]].}}

==== &lt;tt&gt;ct&lt;/tt&gt; ====

&lt;tt&gt;ct&lt;/tt&gt; is intended to spawn a login to a remote system over a modem line, serial line, or similar bearer. It uses the uucp devices list to find the necessary dialing (modem) commands, and the serial line settings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Words and their Flexion==

===Stem Flexion===

1.Words are called in Grammar the Parts of Speech.

Words are either Simple, as flagrare flamma, or Compound as con-flagrare, flamm-i-er
Every Word has meaning and form.  Form helps to determine meaning.

2.Every Word has a STEM and  ROOT.

Word and Stem may be (but seldom are) the same, as tu, thou; aqua, water, while Root differs: flamma, flame: Root, flag-, blaze.

Root and stem are often the same: ag-ere, to act.  Such words are called Radical or Primitive: all others are derivative.

A Compound Word has only one Stem, but as many Roots as it has composing parts.  Thus the Stem of conflagrare is conflagra, the two Roots, cum and flag-.

3.Every true element in a word following the Root is called a SUFFIX:  thus in flamma (for flag-ma) –ma is a Suffix; in flagrare, -r, -a and –re and suffixes.

Suffixes may need a connecting Link or Vincular, which is not elemental: reg-I-bus, quer-I-monia.  The final Suffix, which converts a Stem into a Word, is called an Ending, as –re in flag-r-a-re.  But the Suffix –ma is not called an Ending because flamma is itself a Stem.  When it forms flammas, s is an Ending.

4.A syllable placed before a word to modify its meaning, not being a root word, is called a PREFIX.  Thus in te-tend-I and cin-cinnus, te and cin are Prefixes.  But particles in composition, as de-, re-, and se- are not Prefixes as having roots of their own.

5.The last letter of a Root, as g in flag is called the Root Character.   The last letter of a stem, as a in flamma, is called the Stem Character.  The Stem Character, being of chief importance is also known as the Character of the Word.

6.FLEXION, or Stem Flexion is the method of inflecting a stem, that is, of making such changes in its form to indicate changes in its meaning and uses.  This is usually done by suffixing a Flexional Ending to the Stem: flagra-re; flamma-rum.  Such suffixed endings sometimes need a Vincular, as I in regibus; sometimes they cause a mutation of the stem, as flamm-is for flamma-is (which is for flamma-bus).  Sometimes change in a letter of the Stem itself is an inflection, such as flamm-a (short a) to flamm-a (long a).  Sometimes both Letter-change and Ending are used; ag-, eg-I.  Sometimes Prefix, Letter Change and Ending are used: can-, ce-cin-ci.

7.How then is a Stem defined?

A stem is that part of a Word which is virtually contained in every change of form, though the character is often liable to be hidden through the operation of the laws which determine letter change.  So the character of flamma is hidden in the form flammis; the character of virgin- is hidden in the form virgo; the character of dirif- is hidden in the form direxi.

8.How then is a Root defined?

A Root is the primitive element in any word; that part which the word has in common with all other kindred words.  Thus in agito, the Stem is agrita-, buth the root is ag-, which it has in common with ag-o, ag-men, and many other kindred words.  The Root-character and Root-vowel are more liable to be in hidden through letter change than even the Stem-character.  Thus the Root ag- is contained in the words action, examen, redigo, but obscured in word by some mutation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now that you have familiarised yourself with the basics of writing a class (you should now be able to construct a simple class or two, and manipulate them), let's have a look at some of Objective-C's deeper features.

== Dynamic typing and binding ==
This is one of Objective-C's strongest features, and allows for greater flexibility and simplicity.

Let's look at something we only glossed over before: the type &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== The &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; type ===
Objective-C provides a special type that can hold a pointer to any object you can construct with Objective-C—regardless of class. This type is called &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt;, and can be used to make your Objective-C programming generic.

Let's look at an example of what is known as a ''container class'', that is, a class that is used to hold an object, perhaps in a certain data structure.

Say our container class is a linked list, and we have a linked list of &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt; objects. We don't know what data we might put into the linked list, so this suggests that we might use an &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; as a central data type. Our interface then might look like
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 @interface LinkedListNode : NSObject
 {
    id data;
    LinkedListNode *next;
 }
 
 - (id) data;
 - (LinkedListNode *) next;
 @end
&lt;/source&gt;
This means that we could store any class of object in any linked list node, and we would be able to recover them from the node as easily.

=== Consequences ===
Keeping with the previous example, say we have a linked list of &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; objects. Say now, we want to calculate the word count of each document in the list, by means of a &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; method. 

But, since an &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; type can hold a pointer to ''any'' object, how do we know that the object has the &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; method defined? How do we know that what we are getting out is indeed a &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;?

We could merely declare different classes for lists containing &lt;tt&gt;Documents&lt;/tt&gt;, or lists containing other types, but this duplicates a lot of functionality, which is not the best practice and we lose the generic nature of our &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt; class.

Objective-C provides you with many different solutions to this problem.

=== Dynamic binding ===
Say that our linked list doesn't just contain &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;s, but has also &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; objects as well. Let's assume all these objects have a &lt;tt&gt;title&lt;/tt&gt; method defined, but implemented differently. Since at the core of &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt; is the &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; class, how would we know which &lt;tt&gt;title&lt;/tt&gt; method will be called when we pull out an object from our linked list? Will it be &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;'s? Or &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt;'s? Dynamic binding is a solution to this problem.

''Dynamic binding'' means that  when we call a certain object's method, and there are several implementations of that method, the right one is figured out at runtime. In Objective-C, this idea is used, but is also extended - you are permitted to send ''any'' message to ''any object''. At first glance this may sound rather dangerous, but in fact this allows you a lot of flexibility. 

Let's return to our example. We want to print out all the titles of the objects in the linked list, based on their &lt;tt&gt;title&lt;/tt&gt; method. Dynamic binding means that the right method to be called (&lt;tt&gt;Documents&lt;/tt&gt;'s, &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt;'s, or &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt;'s &lt;tt&gt;title&lt;/tt&gt; method) will be figured out at runtime, and we can simply have a loop in the form 
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
  LinkedListNode *p;
  for(p = start; p != nil /* pointer to no object */; p = [p next])
  {
     printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, [[p data] title]);
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
Dynamic binding is fine for certain circumstances, and can make some other code unexpectedly clearer. However, other circumstances may require more than just this.
I want to say more but this is all basics for dynamic binding.

=== isKindOfClass ===
Say we are not assured that the objects we place into the &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt;s are ''not'' all &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;s. If we have, for example, a &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; object in one of the nodes, and it ''doesn't'' have &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; defined (in Objective-C terminology, we say that &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; objects ''do not respond'' to &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt;), and we try and do something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 LinkedListNode *p; 
 int wordcount_sum=0;
 for(p = start; p != nil /* pointer to no object */; p = [p next])
 {
    wordcount_sum += [[p data] wordCount];
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

this would produce a runtime error when &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; points to the node containing the &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; object, because &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't respond to the &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; message. We ask the &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; to give us a word count, but it doesn't know what to do! In Objective-C, in this example, &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; or any other object can do two things:
# fail, and report the error, or
# send the message on to another object to handle.
We'll look at the second situation in the next section. So, in this instance, the program fails and reports an error.

For this instance, the best Objective-C feature for now, is to use &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;'s &lt;tt&gt;isKindOfClass:&lt;/tt&gt; method. We can add the following check, to get:
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 LinkedListNode *p; 
 int wordcount_sum=0;
 for(p = start; p != nil /* pointer to no object */; p = [p next])
 {
    if([p isKindOfClass:[Document class]])
       wordcount_sum += [[p data] wordCount];
    else
       continue;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This loop will skip over the &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; object in this instance. The class method, &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt;, returns a class object. The type &lt;tt&gt;Class&lt;/tt&gt; is a special type that can hold a pointer to any class object (similar to how &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; can hold a pointer to any object). The instance method &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; also returns the class object for the class of the object. This means that if we wrote the test as &lt;tt&gt;[p class] == [Document class]&lt;/tt&gt;, we could test whether the object's class is ''exactly'' &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;. We could also achieve this result using &lt;tt&gt;[p isMemberOfClass:[Document class]]&lt;/tt&gt;. This contrasts with &lt;tt&gt;[p isKindOfClass:[Document class]]&lt;/tt&gt;, which will check if the object is that class or any of its subclasses (since, due to inheritance, any instance of a subclass &quot;is a&quot; instance of the superclass too). In most cases, &lt;tt&gt;isKindOfClass:&lt;/tt&gt; is the better way to test whether an object is an instance of a class.

This sort of behaviour is a way that ''polymorphism'' is implemented in Objective-C. Polymorphism is a feature of methods that can be applied to different types, which could have different behaviour when applied to those types.

This sort of behaviour can, of course, become unwieldy when used improperly. Objective-C gives you, however, ways of addressing this. We can either make sure that all objects that we may want to work on have a predefined set of methods implemented, by using what is known as a ''protocol'', or we can &quot;tack on&quot; extra methods to the class, to eliminate this redundant checking, by using what is known as a ''category''. Let's look at protocols first.

== Protocols ==
Spies and secret agents must need to make themselves known to other agents, in order to collect information from others. However, the agents must know whether the other spy or agent is really on their side—the bad guys could send a fake spy in to give the other spies false information! So some form of authentication is usually used, such as a password or a passphrase, or a secret handshake, or they may meet at a certain pre-arranged location. All these are examples of protocols to establish whether a person is trustworthy enough.

Objective-C uses protocols in exactly the same manner. An &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; holds any object—we want to make sure that if we call some method upon the contents of an &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; variable, it is guaranteed to respond to it. 

A protocol, in Objective-C, is a list of method declarations that any class that wishes to adopt the protocol ''must'' implement. 

We write a protocol in a similar way to writing an &lt;tt&gt;@interface&lt;/tt&gt; declaration. Here is one typical protocol.
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;

 @protocol Document
 - (int) wordCount;
 - (id) title: (char *) new_title;
 - (char *) title;
 @end

&lt;/source&gt;
Note that we can call the protocol the same as a class—this is okay. It may be useful to place this &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protocol in the same header as the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; class, or we may want to keep it in a separate file.

If we want to signify that the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; class adheres (or is said to ''conform'', in Objective-C) to the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protocol, we must say this in the &lt;tt&gt;@interface&lt;/tt&gt; declaration. We do this by writing
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 @interface Document &lt;Document&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;&lt;Document&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; means that the interface to the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; class adheres to the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protocol. 

Let's revisit our &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt; class. Recall we wanted to get the sum of all the words in each document. But, in our &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt; class, the core datatype is an &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt;. There are basically no restrictions on what we can put into an &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; variable. Ideally, what we'd like to do is say something along the lines of &quot;all objects that adhere to the X, Y or Z protocol&quot;. We use angle brackets again to specify this.

Let's create a new class, call it &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListDocument&lt;/tt&gt;. This class only has in each node an object that conforms to the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protocol. Instead of saying &lt;tt&gt;id data&lt;/tt&gt; in the interface, we say instead:
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 @interface LinkedListDocument : Object
 {
    id &lt;Document&gt; data;
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to use the protocol in the type specification, or in the interface specification, we must import the header file in which the protocol is defined.

=== &quot;Inheritance&quot; of protocols ===
A protocol can incorporate other protocols that have been defined, in a similar way to inheritance, but there is no hierachy imposed upon protocols like there are in classes. For example, in the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protocol, we could write it this way instead:
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;

 @protocol Document &lt;Countable, Titleable&gt;
 @end

 @protocol Countable
 - (int) wordCount;
 @end 

 @protocol Titleable
 - (id) title: (char *) new_title;
 - (char *) title;
 @end

&lt;/source&gt;
This allows us to structure and compartmentalize our protocols at a greater level. However, note that a protocol's method declarations can be empty! This means that we can use &quot;empty&quot; protocols to mark or group certain objects based on a higher level than merely what methods the conforming objects respond to (for example, creating an &quot;empty&quot; &lt;tt&gt;GraphicsBased&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;TextBased&lt;/tt&gt; protocol in order to set the printer mode, which &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; objects could adopt).

=== conformsTo ===
Say we now want to write an &lt;tt&gt;addDocument:&lt;/tt&gt; method to our &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListDocument&lt;/tt&gt; class. We could write something like
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 - (BOOL) addDocument: (id &lt;Document&gt;) newDocument
 {
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;
which means that any object we must pass in to the &lt;tt&gt;addDocument&lt;/tt&gt; method must conform to the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protocol. This may be a little restrictive. We may want to have a declaration like
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 - (BOOL) addDocument: (id) newDocument
&lt;/source&gt;

and return &lt;tt&gt;NO&lt;/tt&gt; when the new document doesn't conform to the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt; protcol, for instance. How can we do this? We may want something that works a little like &lt;tt&gt;isKindOfClass:&lt;/tt&gt;. Objective-C provides us with a method &lt;tt&gt;conformsTo:&lt;/tt&gt; for just this purpose. We can then write &lt;tt&gt;addDocument:&lt;/tt&gt; like
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;

 - (BOOL) addDocument: (id) newDocument
 {
    if([newDocument conformsToProtocol:@protocol(Document)])
    {
       //add the document...
       return YES;
    }
    else return NO;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the &lt;tt&gt;@protocol(Document)&lt;/tt&gt; symbol. This acts in just the same way as &lt;tt&gt;[Document class]&lt;/tt&gt; does, except that &lt;tt&gt;@protocol(Document)&lt;/tt&gt; returns a &lt;tt&gt;Protocol&lt;/tt&gt; object instead of a class object. 

If we however have a protocol, and we want to test whether it incorporates another protocol, we can use &lt;tt&gt;conformsTo:&lt;/tt&gt; as well. For example, given the protocols above (&quot;Inheritance&quot; of protocols), 
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 [@protocol(Document) conformsToProtocol:@protocol(Countable)]
&lt;/source&gt;
would give &lt;tt&gt;YES&lt;/tt&gt; as a result.

* &lt;small&gt;In Java, the keyword &quot;interface&quot; means the same as &quot;protocol&quot; in Objective-C . Objective-C uses &quot;interface&quot; to define a declaration for a class , as in &quot;C++&quot; , so the declaration can be used in header files which can be included in client source files for use. The older C++ and Objective-C do not separate the concerns of defining storage layout and function address tables , so an Objective-C &quot;interface&quot; can only be used for one implementation file , whereas in Java,  only non-storage declarations such as constants and function names and inner interfaces are defined in interface definitions, so these can be reused amongst various implementation classes. The C++ equivalent of a protocol is a abstract class , where in the declaration definition, all the functions end with &quot; = 0;&quot; . In C++,  object implementations of abstract classes can't be received as copy constructed parameters via functions , but can be received as abstract class pointers. In Objective-C , every object made by calling alloc on a class and instantiated with a init function is returned as a pointer to an object , and there seems to be no mechanism for automatic allocation and deallocation on the stack in a function scope , as occurs with non-pointer variable declarations within the body of a function, as in C++.  Java also follows the objective-C lead of only allowing object creation via the &quot;new&quot; keyword and a constructor .  In Java, interfaces are regarded as a kind of superclass relationship, so &quot;X.class.isAssignableFrom(o)&quot; can be used to test for conformance of an object o to a  interface  X.&lt;/small&gt;

== Categories == 
Let's return now to our previous example, where we have &lt;tt&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/tt&gt;s which do ''not'' contain only &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;s. We want to get the sum of all the words in all the &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;s in the linked list. Recall our previous solution that we added a check
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
    if([p isKindOfClass:[Document class]])
       wordcount_sum += [[p data] wordCount];
    else
       continue;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, this sort of check isn't quite the best solution, on a couple of levels. If we've only got &lt;tt&gt;Document&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; objects, and neither &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; objects have a way of providing a word count, then, in essence, their word count could be said to be 0. What we want to do, now, is somehow &quot;stick on&quot; a small implementation of &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; that simply returns 0 for objects that have no word count, and then we can remove the check that we have before and merely let dynamic binding do it's work.

Categories provide this way of &quot;sticking on&quot; extra methods, as an alternative to subclassing. What categories do, is a way of building up a class based on separate pieces that are logically grouped together, for example, by category (hence the name). 

So, how do we define a category? We write it in a similar form to the &lt;tt&gt;@interface&lt;/tt&gt; declaration, but we do this separately.

Here's an example of a &lt;tt&gt;WordCount&lt;/tt&gt; category, on the &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt; class.
We first create an interface for the category:
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 @interface Spreadsheet (WordCount)
 - (int) wordCount;
 @end

&lt;/source&gt;
which goes into a header file, and then the implementation of the category

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
 @implementation Spreadsheet (WordCount)
 - (int) wordCount
 {
    return 0;
 }
 @end
&lt;/source&gt;

which can go in a &lt;tt&gt;.m&lt;/tt&gt; file. Importing the category's header file means that the category is being used. We can do a similar procedure for &lt;tt&gt;Chart&lt;/tt&gt; or any other object we need to add a category to.

Now, &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt; or any other object that has this category, now has a valid &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; method defined upon it (albeit a simple stub method, but we can do anything we like otherwise), so writing the loop 
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;

 for(p = start; p != nil /* pointer to no object */; p = [p next])
 {
    wordcount_sum += [[p data] wordCount];
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

will be successful since if &lt;tt&gt;[p data]&lt;/tt&gt; returns a &lt;tt&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/tt&gt;, the &lt;tt&gt;wordCount&lt;/tt&gt; method will be used. 

Note: methods declared in categories override preexisting methods. This means that we can do some neat tricks (see the Advantages section below). Also beware that the behaviour in picking a method declared in two categories is undefined.

=== Advantages of categories ===
Categories allow us to split up a large class into several pieces. Each can be developed and created independently, and then brought together at the end to form the class.

As a consequence however, this allows us some nice advantages. We can, in essence, extend the functionality of any class that may fall into our hands, whether it is in a class you create yourself, or in a binary form, such as in the OPENSTEP/Cocoa/GNUstep frameworks, we can add a category to &lt;tt&gt;NSString&lt;/tt&gt; to provide functionality that the original &lt;tt&gt;NSString&lt;/tt&gt; did not provide. It is possible to even add categories to &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;! Categories can also be used to override previous functionality, which allows us then to &quot;patch&quot; these preexisting classes also, which might be provided with a bug.  However, this should be done carefully and only as necessary.

== A word on categories ==
And to finish off this section, let's hear some words of wisdom about categories:
: ''What is truly relevant and exciting is how naturally logic is shifted to the appropriate class. Any time Objective-C code looks at the class of an object (using the -isKindOfClass: [isKindOf] method), it is likely that there exists a better, more efficient implementation using categories. This can be generalized with a design heuristic: &quot;Let the runtime do the work of deciding the class of an object&quot;. By using the runtime effectively, a developer can often remove some if/then and most case statements. The benefit is obvious: simpler, cleaner code and better performance, since the runtime is optimized for this task.''

===== example of  polymorphism to eliminate if..then and switch..case type testing =====
&lt;small&gt;Elimination of case statements using polymorphic child classes of a base type or category is mundanely shown in this example:

During runtime of a Snake touchscreen game, a user changes the state of the Snake by touching the screen . The snake object has 4 properties of East , West, North, and South MovementAndResponseState objects, all which have a reference to the owning Snake object and can access needed properties of the Snake object. The MovementAndResponseState class is composed of a MovementCategory and ResponseCategory, the movement category handles the movement of the snake in a particular direction by determining the next position on the snake's list of positions, and the response category handles the response to touch, by determining which of East, West, North, or South properties should be the Current direction property of the Snake object, in response to a user  touch event . The snake object would have the following delegate pattern:-
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
  -(void) move {
    [self.state move];
  }
  
   -(void) handleTouches: (NSSet*) touches forEvent : (UIEvent) event {
   for (UITouch touch in touches )
    [ self.state handleTouch: touch forEvent: event ] ;
  }

 -(void) touchesBegan: (NSSet*) touches forEvent : (UIEvent) event {
  [self handleTouches: touches forEvent: event];
}

 -(void) touchesCancelled: (NSSet*) touches forEvent : (UIEvent) event {
  [self handleTouches: touches forEvent: event];
}

 -(void) touchesMoved: (NSSet*) touches forEvent : (UIEvent) event {
  [self handleTouches: touches forEvent: event];
}

 -(void) touchesEnded: (NSSet*) touches forEvent : (UIEvent) event {
  [self handleTouches: touches forEvent: event];
}
  &lt;/source&gt;

The generalization is that in applications that respond to arbitrary user input and are event driven, alternatives exist to the main window loop with a massive case statement that type tests which event type occurred and dispatches to custom handling code.

*&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_loop_in_Microsoft_Windows &quot; describes the venerable message loop-and-case-statements, and mentions frameworks later hiding this stuff, e.g. having GUI designers that link the handler code to a designed graphical element ala delphi-style properties , cocoa-style arrow dragging between designer editor and program text editor, or per-gui-control-object observer pattern &quot;addXXXListener&quot; callback registries , as in sun java's awt and swing frameworks and eclipse swt framework. 

&lt;/small&gt;

A delicious sandwich for breakfast and fast food!

==Ingredients==
*2 slices [[Cookbook:Bread|brown bread]]
*1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Chili|green chili]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
*5 long slices extra mature [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil |olive oil]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], to taste

==Procedure==
#Toast the two slices of brown bread, until one of the two is not soft anymore (the second one can be).
#Rub the garlic clove on the hard piece of toasted bread, until only a little piece is left. Chop what's left, and scatter on the bread.
#Cut the tomato in two, and crush each side on the same piece of bread. Then spread the juice, cut what's left of the tomato, and put it on the bread.
#Add the olive oil, by being careful not to add more oil than there is bread.
#Add the salt and pepper. Slice or crush the chili, and scatter on the piece of bread. Add the lemon juice.
#Neatly add the slices of cheddar, then close the sandwich with the remaining piece of bread.

==Tips, tricks and variations==
*If you prefer warm sandwiches, the same sandwich can be baked in the oven for a couple of minutes, until the tomatoes and garlic are half-cooked and the cheddar has melted (be careful not to burn it). Avoid the microwave.

== Corrections ==

There is a common error among the phrases on this page. The practice of о being pronounced as /a/ only applies to the syllable immediately before the stress. 

Exx. &quot;зовут&quot; -&gt; /zavut/

* молоко and скоро ;) [[User:62.16.243.119|62.16.243.119]] 15:36, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:I am also confused about this.  According to [http://www.russianforeveryone.com/Rufe/Lessons/Course1/Introduction/IntrUnit3/IntrUnit3.htm this guide], the stressed syllable sounds like &quot;oh&quot;, the syllable before that sounds like &quot;ah&quot;, and all of the others sound like &quot;uh&quot;. If that is the case, shouldn't the pronunciation of хорошо́ be 'khu-ra-SHO', instead of 'kha-ru-SHO'?  I have not studied Russian for a while, so I do not remember which way is correct. [[Special:Contributions/76.111.190.30|76.111.190.30]] ([[User talk:76.111.190.30|discuss]]) 18:54, 22 November 2013 (UTC)

== Stress ==

The stress on some words also appears to be incorrect. I will correct some now... --[[User:Wolfox4777|Wolfox4777]] 16:32, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

It would be nice if someone familiar with IPA could fix this page, and leave the latin for the transliteration instead of pronunciation. [[User:62.16.243.119|62.16.243.119]] 15:37, 20 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Preamble==


This book aims to be an accessible introduction into the design and analysis of efficient algorithms.
Throughout the book we will introduce only the most basic techniques and describe the rigorous mathematical methods needed to analyze them.

The topics covered include:
* The '''divide and conquer''' technique.
* The use of '''randomization''' in algorithms.
* The general, but typically inefficient, '''backtracking''' technique.
* '''Dynamic programming''' as an efficient optimization for some backtracking algorithms.
* '''Greedy algorithms''' as an optimization of other kinds of backtracking algorithms.
* '''Hill-climbing''' techniques, including network flow.

The goal of the book is to show you how you can methodically apply different techniques to your own algorithms to make them more efficient. While this book mostly highlights general techniques, some well-known algorithms are also looked at in depth. This book is written so it can be read from &quot;cover to cover&quot; in the length of a semester, where sections marked with a &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; may be skipped.

This book is a tutorial on techniques and is not a reference. For references we highly recommend the tomes by [Knuth] and [CLRS]. Additionally, sometimes the best insights come from the primary sources themselves (e.g. [Hoare]).

== Why a Wikibook on Algorithms? ==
A [[w:wikibook|wikibook]] is an undertaking similar to an open-source software project: A contributor creates content for the project to help others, for personal enrichment, or to accomplish something for the contributor's own work (e.g., lecture preparation).

An open book, just like an open program, requires time to complete, but it can benefit greatly from even modest contributions from readers. For example you can fix &quot;bugs&quot; in the text (where the bug might be typographic, expository, technical, aesthetic or otherwise) in order to make a better book. If you find an opportunity to fix a bug, simply click on &quot;edit&quot;, make your changes, and click on save. Other contributors may review your changes to be sure they are appropriate for the book. If you are unsure, you can visit the discussion page and ask there. Use common sense.

If you would like to make bigger contributions, you can take a look at the sections or chapters that are too short or otherwise need more work and start writing! Be sure to skim the rest of the book first in order to avoid duplication of content. Additionally, you should read the [[Algorithms/Guidelines_for_Contributors|Guidelines for Contributors]] page for consistency tips and advice.

Note that you don't need to contribute everything at once. You can mark sections as &quot;TODO,&quot; with a description of what remains to be done, and perhaps someone else will finish those parts for you. Once all TODO items are finished, we'll have reached our First Edition!

This book is intentionally kept narrow-in-focus in order to make contributions easier (because then the end-goal is clearer). This book is part two of a series of three computer science textbooks on algorithms, starting with ''[[Computer Science:Data Structures|Data Structures]]'' and ending with ''[[Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms|Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]]''. If you would like to contribute a topic not already listed in any of the three books try putting it in the ''Advanced'' book, which is more eclectic in nature. Or, if you think the topic is fundamental, you can go to either the [[Talk:Algorithms|Algorithms discussion page]] or the [[Talk:Data Structures|Data Structures discussion page]] and make a proposal.

Additionally, implementations of the algorithms as an appendix are welcome.

[[User:Mshonle|Macneil Shonle]] A large portion of my contributions here come from lectures made by [Impagliazzo] at UCSD. I like this project because it gives me a chance to explain algorithms in the way that I finally understood them

[[User:Waxmop|Matthew Wilson]] I typed in an outline after finishing a graduate algorithms course. M. Shonle has taken this textbook and really made it something great.

[[User:krischik|Martin Krischik]] I supplied the Ada examples for the algorithms. You never know if an algorithm works until you have actually implemented it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What makes the phase space variables &quot;momentum&quot; and &quot;position&quot; (p, q) so special, compared to other possible choices such as the set of variables &quot;velocity&quot; and &quot;position&quot;? The reason is the additional property of the phase space (p,q) of having a &quot;symplectic structure&quot;. 

Let us define a &quot;symplectic unit matrix&quot;

&lt;math&gt;I \equiv \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; 

where -1 is an even-dimensional unit matrix. The dimension of the matrices we are talking about is the phase-space dimension, which is always even (each position variable is paired with a momentum variable). This is essentially the matrix generalization of the imaginary unit that we know from complex algebra. Simply put, symplectic spaces arise when unit matrices are replaced by symplectic matrices in strategically chosen places.

This sounds simple, but there is a catch: what is the square root of a matrix? As we already know from complex algebra, there isn't just one single answer for the square root. In mechanics, the root that we mean by I is moreover 'totally antisymmetric'. This still does not completely determine what I is. To get further, we need to think about the physics in phase space. In particular, we will encounter the phenomenon of volume preservation under temporal evolution.

[[Image:CDC_black.jpg|right|blackberries]]
The '''blackberry''' is popular for making [[Cookbook:Jam|jams]], wine, and dessert filling.

==Selection==
In general, berries should be dry, firm, well-shaped, and eaten within a week after purchase. If you can’t eat them that soon, remember that berries freeze well! It’s best to buy berries that are ‘in-season’ as they’ll cost less and are more ripe and flavorful than ‘out-of-season’ berries.

Stay away from containers of berries with juice stains which may be a sign that the berries are crushed and possibly moldy; soft, watery fruit that means the berries are overripe; dehydrated, wrinkled fruit that means the berries have been stored too long.

Select blackberries that are unblemished and dry, in an unstained container. Blackberries should be shiny and black — avoid those that are dull or reddish. Moisture will increase spoilage, so the berries themselves should be relatively dry. Shelf life for blackberries is short, so they should be consumed within 2–3 days of purchase. Eat at room temperature for fullest flavor.

==Frozen==
A 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] bag of whole frozen blackberries is equal to about 3 cups frozen berries.

Whole frozen berries destined for your [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods should be used frozen. Gently fold into [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]], [[Cookbook:Cake|cakes]] and [[Cookbook:Muffin|muffins]] just prior to use.

Store whole frozen berries in their unopened or tightly resealed packages in your freezer. If berries are to be served alone, thaw until they are pliable and serve partially frozen. Add sugar to taste — it brings out both the flavor and the luscious juices.

==Variants==
Since blackberry plants easily hybridize, there are many cultivars with more than one species in their ancestry.
*Dewberries (R. caesius) are smaller than blackberries and can be distinguished by the white waxy coating on the fruits, which also usually have fewer drupelets.
*Boysenberries were bred from blackberries, loganberries, and raspberries.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Blackberry|1|1|1|1|2|2|3|3|1|1|1|1}}

Blackberries reach their peak towards the end of summer, specifically July to August. In warmer climates, the season may start earlier and end later. For instance, the Californian blackberry season starts in May and ends in October. [http://www.allthingsfrugal.com/w.blackberry.htm][http://www.produceoasis.com/TipOTDay_folder/Tips_folder/Jun9tip.html]

Superstition in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK]] holds that blackberries should not be picked after September 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, as the devil has claimed them and left his mark on the leaves. There is some value behind this legend, since wetter and cooler weather often allows the fruit to become infected by various molds including Botrytis. These molds can give the berries an unpleasant flavor and make them toxic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Latin [[w:en:Phonology|phonology]]'' should be somewhat familiar to many readers, since it is an ancestor to the phonological systems of many of the world's most popular languages. In addition, one system of Latin phonology remains alive today, in institutions such as the [[w:en:Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]; this system is known as [[w:en:ecclesiastical Latin|ecclesiastical Latin]].

The Roman alphabet has five basic [[w:en:Vowel|vowels]]: a, e, i, o, u. In addition, there are five [[w:en:Diphthong|diphthongs]]: ae, au, eu, oe, ou. There are seventeen basic consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, x. There are three letters that are found only in foreign borrowings: two consonants (k, z) and one vowel (y). There are also a few consonant digraphs. To further complicate things, in many texts ''i'' and ''j'' are both written ''i'' (very common) while both ''u'' and ''v'' are often both written ''u'' (less common, and found in some modern printings) or both written ''v'' (very common in ancient inscriptions). For more detail, see [[w:Latin spelling and pronunciation|Latin spelling and pronunciation]] on Wikipedia.

===Diphthongs and Diagraphs===

A diphthong is a vowel combination that is pronounced as a single sound. It is often described as a ‘glide’ between two vowels. A diagraph is a similar combination--the only difference between the two is that both the vowels are distinctly pronounced. 

'''Diphthongs'''

{| align=&quot;laft&quot; style=&quot;background:/#0000 border=6&quot;
| '''ae'''
| A glide between an /a/ and an /&amp;#603;/. similar to the English ‘ie’ in pie which is a glide between /a/ and /&amp;#618;/
|-
| '''au'''
| A glide between an /a/ and an /ʊ/ pronounced as the ‘ow’ in how
|-
| '''ei'''
| A glide between an /ɛ/ and an /&amp;#618;/  pronounced as the ‘ey’ in they
|-
| '''oe'''
| A glide between an /&amp;#596;/ and an /&amp;#603;/. Similar to the English ‘oy’ in boy which is a glide between an /&amp;#596;/ and an /&amp;#618;/.
|}

'''Diagraphs'''

{| align=&quot;laft&quot; style=&quot;background:/#0000 border=6&quot;
| '''eu'''
| A glide between an /&amp;#603;/ and an /ʊ/.
|-
| '''ui'''
| A glide between an /ʊ/ and an /&amp;#618;/, pronounced approximately as the 'uee' in queen.

== Algorithms text ==

Hi Martin: I'm not sure if the Algorithms wikibook should really include that many wikilinks links like that. It's different from an encyclopedia entry and should be self-contained. That is, it might be better to keep outside surfing to a minimum. What do you think? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:40, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

=== Wiki links ===

I put those links in the algorithms book because I had to look them up myself because I don't know all the technical terms. They are in the prerequisites section of the document so I thought it would be nice to find links to what you should read before reading this document. But if you think that they should be covered somewhere in the book or readers should know that before attempting to read the book it's ok with me.

[[User:MMartin|MMartin]] 10:05, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Maybe referencing them to the Data Structures wikibook would be better (which, sadly, is mostly just wikipedia links for the moment). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:22, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::Sounds like a good idea, although it might be better to do this when there is actual content in the Data Structures wiki book. You can change the links now if you want to, but the users will be send to the wikipedia pages anyway. The only argument for referencing the Data Structures book now is that the book might be looked at one extra time and someone might write content for it.  [[User:Mmartin|Mmartin]] 12:15, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::Well, it's probably suitable either way. I guess I just had a knee-jerk reaction because I didn't want the whole book itself to be filled with links. But since it's just the prereqs it's all fine. (I don't want too many links because I want the reader to, in theory, be able to print out the book and read it. Some of us have even been tossing the idea around of writing a wiki to latex to pdf converter, to get really nicely formatted books made. Alas, no time.) But good point about getting more traffic to the Data Structures book. It's really struggling. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:34, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Guidelines and direction==
Welcome to the project! Thanks all for your contributions. If you are new to writing for this book '''please read the following guidelines''' and style adopted:

# This is a ''techniques-oriented book'': We aren't aiming to create an encyclopedia of every algorithm ever created, nor are we trying to present the absolutely best versions of particular algorithms (though we can of course mention the state of the art and where to find it). At this book's heart, we discuss the high-level &quot;tricks&quot; used by many algorithms in the hope of demystifying them.
# The book uses ''pseudocode to efficiently explain the algorithms'', but the pseudocode should be clear and expository (and commented when there is a chance for confusion). Additionally, this book includes (will include) Python implementations of the algorithms in an appendix. Appendecies can be written for other languages as well.
# This is a ''teaching book'': The materials should help the student and the autodidact alike in learning the material. If material requires information not specified in the prerequisites, that information should be covered too. The hope is that after covering this text, the reader can better consult Knuth and CLR (and other algorithms books we should recommend).
# ''Use primary sources'' as much as possible. This is good practice for two reasons: (1) because the book is technique-oriented, sometimes the first presentation of an algorithm is the clearest guide to its insight. For example, the original paper on quicksort simply relied upon &quot;random&quot; in order to get good performance. The layers of deterministic optimizations to quicksort over the past four decades have helped the algorithm, but only mystify a beautiful idea further. And, (2) because this is a free/open book, we must be very careful that we use proper citations and never plagarize other material. (Always ask for permission if you need to use a secondary source.)
# Use the wikipedia as another source for material, but edit the material to present only the main points and ideas: the encyclopedic detail of the wikipedia can become a distraction when trying to read a book that is not meant to be a reference book.
# Use the mathematical royal &quot;we&quot; for some phrases, but try to use the second-person &quot;you&quot; as much as possible: it makes sentences easier to construct that also sound more direct.
# Look for insights into understanding an algorithm or a part of the software engineering process in general.
# We cover backtracking before dynamic programming and greedy algorithms because both can be thought of as special cases of backtracking.
# Randomization is an important concept that's gaining more and more ground: it's discussed early instead of later because it shouldn't be thought of as an &quot;advanced&quot; or intimidating topic. It represents an attitude that shows where cutting edge research is heading, so we should be one of the books that best absorbs this paradigm.
# Please use &quot;active voice&quot;, rather than &quot;passive voice&quot;. ( Too many texts say stuff like &quot;A null is put on the end of every string.&quot;. Huh ? Does that mean I need to make sure I manually add more code to add a newline to the end ? Does that mean the routine already puts a newline at the end of the code ? Does that mean the OS puts these newlines there ? Active voice avoids all this confusion: &quot;The readline() puts a null on the end of the string&quot;. )

==Chapter headings and buckets==
I just finished an advanced algorithms course, and this is what we covered. Right now, this is a terribly disorganized list because I'm dumping topics from my handwritten notes here. Later we should reorganize this.  I suggest we follow the &quot;big buckets first&quot; approach and keep this as a one-page article until the length becomes unmanageable.  Disprosia, when you replaced all my level-one headings, you didn't replace my level-two headings, so you flattened out my list.  Some items were children of other items, but now, everything is one the same plane.  Was this intentional?  If so, it'd be nice if you posted a reason behind that.

:My two-cents: I think that One-Level headings should be used for Chapter titles. This isn't the wikipedia, so the taboo against using one-level headings doesn't exist. These chapters might be best viewed as separate web-pages, and if that feature were to be implemented, discriminating based on one-level headings would be a good way to go. But I don't know the general wikibook rule of doing it, so I won't modify it back yet. [[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 21:35, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)

This section looks outdated. Should it be removed? --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 22:19, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Sure, is there a standard place to archive it? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:49, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Code versus Pseudo Code (was &quot;Guidelines&quot;)==
Here are my thoughts on where the book should go:

# introduce backtracking before DP and greedy algorithms, as backtracking is easy to understand and helps in the understanding of DP and greedy.
# I intend on posting more notes from my own classes.
# we should use some pseudocode language that makes the algorithms themselves as clear as possible. We shouldn't do just one popular language or try to use multiple languages. pseduocode I've seen lately matches python, so maybe we'll want it to look more like a typed-Python
# we may want to consider genetic algorithms as well.
([[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 21:02, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC))

Thanks for all the work you've done!  Here's my thoughts:
# I prefer well-commented real code (in any language) over pseudocode.  Pseudocode can be ambiguous.  I suggest we list as many code implementations of algorithms as possible.  I like python and C, but I don't want to get a language war started.  I just know [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/5/26/9428/83027 I don't like pseudocode].
# Genetic algorithms (I think) are used in NP-complete problems, so we should introduce them after that point.

--[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 18:24, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:For point 1: I think pseudocode is superior to explaining an algorithm than &quot;real code&quot;. It's very, very hard to introduce algorithmic concepts if you have language implementation issues to contend with on top of that. Furthermore, I've seen a lot of algorithms books, and only the best books used pseudocode (we'll ignore for the moment that Knuth chose assembly). The syntax I've been using shouldn't be ambiguous at all: if you think something is ambiguous, you should mention it and we can work on it. Also, the pseudocode borrows heavily from Python anyway, only it's *less* ambiguous. For example, I include &quot;end if&quot; (as &quot;fi&quot;) and &quot;end for&quot; (as &quot;repeat&quot;) so that you can see where one if ends and another begins.

::''I've seen languages mark the bottom of a loop with &quot;next&quot; (BASIC), &quot;loop&quot; (ASM), or &quot;continue&quot; (C). Is there some real language that uses &quot;repeat&quot; ? (I think it's fine for pseudocode). -- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:15, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)''

:::''Knuth presented the loop-while-repeat structure in one of his essays in the Literate Programming book. Because the pseudocode looks close enough to Python, but contains different features, it's important to make it look different enough so there's no confusion. The compromise was to include Python implementations of everything in an appendix, so no ambiguity would exist (provided the reader knew Python).'' [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:00, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I also made this point for the data-structures book: there's no real advantage of including as many languages as possible: the current fad language (which is either Java or C#) and Python should be sufficient. If you want to create a &quot;Python Implementation&quot; appendix for all of the code in the book, feel free, but I most certainly do not want to clutter the text with three different implementations of the same thing (which makes the text look like it has a lack of focus and readers will get bored because perhaps they only care about C++ instead). I propose we use pseudocode for all of the book, and only attempt &quot;real&quot; implementations in an appendix (perhaps on a separate web-page). That should resolve your concernes.

:For point 2: Genetic algorithms is its own technique, and this is a technique driven book, so if we were to cover them they should get their own chapter. (The &quot;techniques&quot; for NP-complete problems are proving their NP-completeness; i.e. the technique is run-time analysis of the polynomial time verifier and reductions. The backtracking section will include implementations for several NP-complete problems.) Either way, it would be a good idea to include an NP-complete approximation algorithm in the genetic algorithms chapter. I haven't made an outline for it yet as I don't have the materials to cover it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:13, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Here's an example of comparing code. Here's the Python version:

 def get_ugliest_puppy(puppies):
 ugliest = None
 for p in puppies:
     if ugliest = None: ugliest = p
     elif p.ugliness &gt; ugliest.ugliness: ugliest = p
 return ugliest

And now the pseudocode:

 ''// find-max -- returns the maximum element, or -infinity if the array is empty''
 function '''find-max'''(array ''vals''):
   let ''result'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   for-each ''v'' in ''vals'':
     ''result'' := max(''result'', ''v'')
   repeat
   
   return ''result''
 end

Where the text will note that max between any object and negative infinitiy will always result in the object. You also note that code should be heavily commented: this is primarily a text, so the &quot;comments&quot; are the descriptions. But I do like the idea of having a sentence before each function, to hammer home &quot;this is what this function should do&quot;. (It's good practice in real-life, as well.)

By allowing mathematics into the code, which is what all successful pseudocode based books do, you can speak on the higher-level of mathematics. The Aho book uses &quot;sets&quot; and only later do they mention different data-structures to use to make Dijkstra more efficient. (I think when the Dijkstra section gets written it will be worthy to discuss those trade offs.) There is a danger of being too mathematically clever, but part of the point of the book is to bring the reader into the world of mathematics.

Thinking of &quot;well, I guess I need an if in there that needs to check each time if we're iterating for the first time or not&quot; is not mathematical: it's just implementation details. In contrast, thinking of a for loop as a way to generalize the &quot;max&quot; function is loaded with detail. Once you arm the reader with that insight, they might see where that line of thinking can apply elsewhere.

Note, if we jumped into the functional programming zone, the function would be a one liner:

 function '''find-max'''(array ''vals'') := reduce(max, null, ''vals'')

I do ''not'' think that's the way to go: Then the algorithm becomes too subtle and the solution only seems to be from the heavens: not from some general principle.

Eitherway, I think the strongest argument in favor of pseudocode (after the expository reasons) is that it's less likely to alienate readers than picking one specific language (picking multiple languages doesn't solve the problem because it turns the book into a comparitive programming language text instead of an algorithmic technique text; but a linked-to appendix of implemenations is a fine solution: such code should also have test cases and run results to show that it actually works). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:30, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Example pseudocode. ==

We can put links in the main text that point to implementations in each language.  Maybe it would look something like this:

 function '''return-1'''():
   return 1
 end

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| align=&quot;right&quot; | ''[[Python]]'', ''[[Java]]'', ''[[Scheme]]''
|}

The table code for it looks ugly, but it'll be out of the way from the reading yet also easy to access. (Naturally, little code snippits don't need the link, but each completed algorithm could have one.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:42, 5 Aug 2004 (UTC)


==Some code we can use==
Eric Lippert is allowing us to use [http://weblogs.asp.net/ericlippert/archive/2004/07/21/189974.aspx this entry] from his blog to cover the longest common subsequence. We just need to provide the above link in our references section. ([[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 21:02, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC))

== Techniques versus Types of Data Philosophy ==

Because this is a text book, and not an encyclopedia, of algorithms, this book should focus on the underlying algorithmic techniques involved. Text books tend to discuss algorithms in two different ways: the &quot;types of data&quot;-oriented book breaks algorithms discussed into directed graph, undirected graph, string algorithms, and trees chapters; while the techniques-oriented book breaks algorithms discussed into the different techniques used: dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and divide and conquer.

Naturally, there are books that merge the two philosophies. However, in order to carry a coherent message, and to aid learning, I believe this book should be '''technique-oriented'''. The insights to understanding greedy algorithms is aided when you see examples that include directed and undirected graphs. The insights to understanding dynamic programming (a particularly challenging topic to some) is aided when you see examples that include text, numerical, and graph problems. Some people get stuck in certain ways of thinking and seeing the methodolgy of one algorithmic solving technique in different contexts helps. Were we to be an exhaustive encyclopedia, we might consider the other presentation. However, this book must start out slim, and will likely be used to supplement other books already used in courses. Therefore, providing the high-level insights will be beneficial.

We do not want a book that merely brings down &quot;from the heavens&quot; solutions like Dijsktra's algorithm without giving the firm footing underneath to allow people to make their own algorithms. [[User:Mshonle|Mshonle]] 06:48, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Time to break up the single page... ==
I made a spelling edit to the text and I got a warning that the algorithms pages is 50kb, and some browsers might have trouble.  I suggest we break up section into it own link based on the headings.   Any other ideas?

:I think breaking into pages by chapter seems like a good way to do it. The Chapter headings should still exist in the main page (so the table on contents will still be there), but only be links to the full page. That means a chapter might not be able to grow past 32k, though, without seeing the warnings again. I've seen other books try to put a separate page for *everything* and that's just death: No one can read the book as easily, potential future contributors included.

:Do you know if there is a way to disable to top-level &quot;edit&quot; link? That way the largest text area editable at a time would be a chapter. That would probably be better than the breaking up solution.

:I've also been discussing writing a tool that can turn the wiki into a pdf file (via latex), which would be a great way to give people something readable. But that shouldn't happen until the book is in better shape. I've been off the project to get work done, but next quarter I'm taking the PhD algorithms class, and I intend to get my notes in as I take it (sure, we've all heard that one before :-). Either way, I don't really like the format of the Data Structures book, which seems to be struggling quite a bit. I think partially the set up seems to encourage people to write wikipedia-like entries (or to copy wikipedia entries), but that's no way to write a textbook. A book needs more focus, and doesn't need to mention all of the history or sidebar level details that are appropriate for an encyclopedia entry. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:48, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC)

OK, it's been broken up into chapters. The names of the subsections are the chapter numbers instead of the title of the chapter in hopes to keep the idea that this is all part of a single book, and not a collection of unrelated entries. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:28, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)

----

Some quick comments after I've read the first chapter:
* It seems to focus too closely on low-level optimization ( See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProfileBeforeOptimizing http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OptimizeLater ).
* It seems to tell people to re-invent the wheel every time (NIH syndrome) rather than use standard library functions.
* Where's the big-O notation ?

I hope this is covered in later chapters

-- DavidCary

:Hi David, Big-O notation is covered in the second chapter. Also, I'm not sure why you think that the chapter is focused on low-level optimization? I thought the &quot;When is Efficiency Important?&quot; subsection addressed that quite well. (Moreover, I don't think we even mention ''any'' low-level optimizations. We discuss different implementations for to-lower, but that's only to motivate the point for abstraction and the different levels of thinking.) If you are thinking of something else, please do explain.

:As for the reinventing the wheel: The goal of the book is to introduce algorithmic techniques. We could invent problems (like homework assignments) that don't have solutions in libraries and present algorithms that solve them, but I think it's more natural to present well-known problems, because the motivation is better and the statement of the problem is easier. (The Python appendix has a note to implementers to demonstrate the use of standard libraries.) Either way, reinventing the wheel can be good, too: You want to avoid it as a common practice, but doing it once when taking a course in algorithms can be quite instructive. Every cute guideline has an exception. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 16:13, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Some links that can handy... ==

== All Chapters View ==

I created some templates that redirect to each chapter and then made an Uberpage that includes all of the templates.

You can find the link here: [[Computer_Science:Algorithms:Full_Text]]

I don't want to post it too many places yet, because it might cause for some heavy server load. Also, it includes the chapter nav templates at the beginning and end of each chapter: A Chapter_1_contents page (e.g.) would have to be created that would be the real content of the book, and then the single-chapter view of each would include the content plus the navigation, and the many-chapter view would only include all of the content pages. (Navigation might also be hurt in that style.) Perhaps for the Data Structures book we can try it that _content-based way to see how it works because there's still quite a bit of outlining left to do for that book.

Any other ideas welcome.
-- [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:14, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: I like this concept very much! I started to try a little bit in my private sandbox how to improve this concept and make it more generally accessible. I thought of using templates to shield navigational elements in the PRINT version, so that one does not have to put all the content in templates (which has the disadvantage, that a user can not click &quot;edit this page&quot; on top to make changes). The shielding could work by using templates with parameters, but one has to be a little bit tricky. I've also been playing around with CSS2 page breaks (that currently work in Firefox) which might enhance the printing experience. All of this is in development, but I will let you know when it works, and when I have a handful of simple templates that anybody can use. (For now, if you have some time, help me to review some books and give [[Help:Development stages|development stages]] to some books on the [[IT bookshelf]]) (Another hint: templates don't actually have to be in the template: namespace. Each page can be included by preceding &quot;:&quot;, like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:somepage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 11:58, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Hi MShonle. I just reviewed your book to update your [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]. It is a very clearly written book. I think the chapters are more complete than you suggest by having all the &quot;ToDos&quot; around each chapter. Even without them, the chapters look consistent to me, and I would give more chapters &quot;100%&quot; (and attract more possible readers) if you just deleted the ToDos, or put them collectively at the very end. But having empty subsection titles all over is not so reader-friendly, according to my opinion (and I am a reader! :-) ). See also my comment above on &quot;All Chapters View&quot; .--[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 11:58, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks. I think there's some more work that needs to be done before attracting more readers: it's still very much in the cathedral stages right now. Right now trying to get more writers is my primary objective. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 08:14, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Followup: Another reason to embed the TODOs right now is because the author of a section has an &quot;ultimate plan&quot; for that section, and the TODOs reflect the structure desired. How to present materials is highly subjective, so there isn't a &quot;default&quot; way for contributors to write, say, a divide and conquer chapter. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 17:48, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Hi MShonle, I guess I got your point. If you have a clear view of how things should be structured, then this is probably the best way. You're right, there's no point in presenting something as &quot;ready&quot; if it just is not yet. Actually, when browsing through your chapters, I thought about adding Newton's approximation by myself, but I was not quite sure how it would fit from the programming side (I'm more a physicist..). Keep the work, it is really getting a great book! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 21:39, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::Please do add, w.r.t. Newton's square root method (the general method should probably go in the calculus book isntead). For the programming I can put in the code. (Or, you can post an outline on the talk page before you write too much?) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:20, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::::I just added it to your chapter 8, [[Algorithms/Chapter_8#Newton's Root Finding Method|Newton's Root Finding Method]]. Just after I added it, I found your comment that you just would like the square root formula. Well, I hope it is not too long now, and in principle, the Newton's method should be familiar from middle school (I guess, there is nothing wrong with presenting a little bit of calculus to programmers). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 00:16, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::Thanks! One style note is that we want to use wikipedia links as sparingly as possible: the idea is that the book should be self-contained and someone could print it out and use it, instead of clicking through many external pages. As for the calculus angle, perhaps the square root method itself could be derived from the more general material, and have the algorithm that uses the simpler method (i.e., averaging the guesses) be presented first. Thus, the calculus details can still be there, but be in a starred (&quot;*&quot;) section to let the reader know it's not essential to know to understand later material. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:41, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::A star * section (or a note to skip at first reading) is fine with me. About the Wikipedia links: They won't show on printed material (look at your browser's Print Preview, if it supports CSS), and on screen they add interactivity: If I don't know a word, I just click on it, instead of having to type it into Google. It doesn't mean I have to follow all the links there are. I see it as a possibility to enhance the screen version of Wikibook (by its partner Wikipedia) to something more &quot;live&quot; than a &quot;real&quot; book. This said as a suggestion, the main stylistic decisions are of course determined by the main contributors (which is you..) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 02:19, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::Thanks for the comments: I have nothing against rich-links in principle, but they can create a confusing congitive experience for the reader. For example, they might think &quot;do I need to understand this link?&quot;, &quot;do I need to follow this?&quot;, and there's no clear answer as to how far the links should be followed. The rule of thumb is that if the link is required, it should be replaced with further exposition in the text instead. If a link isn't required, then perhaps a link at the bottom in a special &quot;for further reading&quot; section could be done. But too much information overload can turn a reader off: it can be exhausting either following links or determining not to follow links. (We may even privately decide that &quot;all links are optional&quot; but the challenge still remains that the reader might not know that, and second guess.)

:::Naturally, I think the wikipedia itself should have as many links as possible (within reason) because part of the value of the wikipedia is the richness of the links as a way for someone doing research to start from, say, Alan Greenspan, and follow links to the Federal Reserve, to the money supply, to inflation. But for wikibooks, I see the goal is primary to educate and have the reader gain special knowledge of a single topic. Too many distractions can hurt the focus. Most of the topics we cover are also wikipedia articles, so the tutorial nature is the value we are adding on top of that. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:47, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Sidenote: For one example, links such as &quot;root of a function&quot; are probably best removed with a discussion of what a root of a function is (presumably copied from the wikipedia) and put in the Mathematical Background chapter of the text. Other links, such as &quot;derivative&quot; are probably too advanced: either the user will understand calculus and know already what a derivative is, or wouldn't be enlightened enough following the link: some concepts require a semester to really &quot;get&quot;. (Though, I suppose you could make an arugment for including a link to the calculus book.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:57, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Sidenote #2: I also forgot to mention the role of the ''[[Computer Science:Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms|Advanced]]'' book: it's much more eclectic in content and is meant to be more of a reference than a tutorial that is read cover-to-cover. Thus, in that context I could also see the high value of using wikipedia links. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:07, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Guidelines Questions ==
* Should all math be placed in &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags? This conflicts with the advice at [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:How to write a Wikipedia article on Mathematics#Typesetting_of_mathematical_formulas|How to write a Wikipedia article on Mathematics]], but of course, local guidelines win out. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 22:19, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:My general bias is to use the math tags when possible. It's easier to type the single-quote versions, so there are places that still use them. Also, the pseudocode formatting is different: all variable names are slanted while only functions defined in the book, or as an exercise, are bold-- assumed library functions like max or abs aren't bolded. (This is as opposed to making keywords bold, which draws attention to the very thing that needs the least attention.) Function or variable names refered to in the text probably should not have the math tag, while actual formulas should.

:The general idea is that a wiki to LaTeX tool will be written and the user can download a clean PDF: the conversion process will be easier if the tag is used consistently. (Also, for publishing, the other plan is that this book and the Data Structures book would be combined into a single Data Structures and Algorithms book.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:19, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

* How deeply nested should headings be? In [[Computer_Science:Algorithms:Chapter 2#Mathematical_Definitions|chapter 2]], my first inclination is to make a separate subheading for each term that's defined. Is that reasonable, or are you trying to keep the heirarchy as flat as possible? --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 22:19, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:I think it's more of a question of emphasis. The Mathematical Definitions section is primarily there to provide a little more detailed explaination of elements used in later chapters.

:For example, in the Longest Common Subsequence section I realized that I shouldn't assume everyone knew what a subsequence (or what a sequence) was, so that it needed to be defined along with some suitable examples. Instead of distracting from the discussion with the defintion and examples, I decided to put it in the front of the book. (Another goal is to avoid wikipedia links, so that the reader can enjoy the book on its own (possibly printed out) and not get frustrated trying to figure out what is just a footnote and what is manditory. Of course, much of the content in that section has been copied from the wikipedia, but edited for tutorial purposes.)

:So, having headings would probably draw too much attention to what really is a glorified footnote and probably attract contributions trying to cover the topic in further depth, even though such depth might not be useful in understanding the rest of the book.

== Check sort - precursor to the Rapid sort - used to eliminate duplicates ==

I have &quot;invented&quot; several algorithms which after having been reduced t minimum form are so simple it is obvious that any other computer programmer could have invented them independently. The Check sort is a good example. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sorting_algorithm#In_preparation_for_further_discussion... Check sort] not only sorts numerical data (and potentially also alphanumeric data converted to its ASCII code) it main value and purpose is in eliminating duplicates. Even though simple enough to have been invented independently and at a prior time I have not been able to find another algorithm which duplicates its function although others have claimed that its successor the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sorting_algorithm#In_preparation_for_further_discussion... Rapid sort] is nothing more than a version of the Bucket sort in one instance or the Counting sort in another. I feel that both sort routines are useful and unique enough, however, as to merit their distinction and publication ''somewhere'' even though they have not been published elsewhere except on my homepage in 1996 and briefly in the past month in the Wikipedia (now restricted to talk pages) The Rapid sort is now published on line in the Urban Dictionary. Furthermore because I modified the Harvard Chart Method of Logical Equation Reduction to handle multiple states so that I might explore a computer's capability of reducing multiple state logical equations to minimum form and thus be able to &quot;think&quot; at the level of a human being and comment on such issues as to whether God exists or not (which actually as a result led me to the logical definition of God that God is the only entity by definition who can reduce an infinite number of equations having an infinite number of variables with and infinite number of states to minimum form instantaneously) it can not be published under the WP:NOR policy. The same restriction applies to an article entitled &quot;Optimal classification&quot; I wrote about Dr. Rypka's method of microbiological classification after using my own research to answer several questions, clarify several misconceptions and eliminate other points of confusion. I would therefore like to inquire about publication of these methods here. [[User:Typetive|Typetive]] 09:49, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:This book is a catalog of algorithmic techniques, not a catalog of every algorithm ever invented by somebody. I just don't think it really fits the aim of this book. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:57, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
::Most such algorithms will not find themselves in this book anyway since they were originally published by the ACM or IEEE or other Journals who copyright their publications and require paid membership and or subscriptions or purchase of the articles in which the algorithms appear. In this case the author has presented an algorithm without requiring its purchase, a rare but welcome event. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 17:31, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

== Merge with other book: Nay ==

I see no meritt in merging the [[Algorithm implementation]] book with this one. The two books have different aims. To have the best learning experience books must be focused and not aim to be everything to everyone.

My recommended course of action is that the two projects be aware of each other's aims. Given that the table of contents for this book is fixed and stable all that's required is that the new book's plan complements this book's plan. It's probably misleading that both books have the word &quot;Algorithm&quot; in the title. In one, it's the mathematical definition, while the other is the more general programming definition (as a synonym for &quot;subroutine&quot;). --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

````
I am very very new to WIKI, but very very old in the computer game, I published my first computer paper, the design of a random access system for manufacturing control in 1958. I have since retired from BTL/WE/etc and playing at computer. I looked with interest in your development of a book, inh public ..., that is very good. Now the final very very good step would be for you to PROVE conclusively thatthe algorithms that you may illustrate really work, and if the need for final code rather than pseudo code then you MUST prove their equivalency, and then having done that your printing system for the final imprint MUST develop the result of the algorithm in real time using the correct softsware as part of the type setting system, so that you need not actually provide the answer to be typset. That is the most likely point of error. This has been done long ago in the Manual for the sam76 language, and the only time there was a erroneous answer was traced back to a fault in the algorithm manjuscript. An example of what I mean is in [[Algorithms in Sam76]] rectly posted in Wikki.  Good Luck

== Standardized pseudocode ==

Is there a page that specifies the pseudocode that is to be used in this wikibook?

If more than a couple of people are going to contribute, it really needs to be defined and included as an appendix in the book as well as in a style guide. I've spent about 1/2 hr trying to find some kind of specification, and haven't been able to.

: There was a definition called [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Wikicode|Wikicode]] but it is now depreciated and was not never used in Algorithms. Personaly I think rightfully - a pseudocode should use little special characters as possible &lt;small&gt;(better begin/end then '{'/'}' - you can look up the meaning of begin in an english dictonary but not the meaning of '{')&lt;/small&gt;.

== Prime numbers ==

Hello, there is a book in the Mathematics subject, [[A More Efficient Prime Number Generating Algorithm]], that I wonder if it might fit in this book?  I have not taken a course on algorithms so I do not know and I wonder what those who have worked on this book think?  This book has some original research, it is short (more like a section than a book), and is mostly on an algorithm to make a list of primes.  So, I thought maybe it could fit here somewhere.  And, since it has no references and seems to have original research, I thought perhaps one of you might know of a reference on the subject to use as well instead of just copying directly from this other &quot;book&quot;.  Any thoughts?  [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 20:10, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

==Matrices and Linear Transformations==

It turns out that linear transformations can be represented in a 1-1 fashion in matrices. This chapter will be most likely be a review as the topic has already probably been covered in high school (see this [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Matrices|link]]). The establishment of a one-to-one correspondence between linear transformations and matrices is very important in the study of linear transformations.

Suppose you have a set of basis vectors x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of a vector space X and basis vectors y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of a vector space Y.

Consider a linear transformation T from X to Y, and the vectors

T(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;+...+y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
T(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;+...+y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
T(x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)=y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;+...+y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
T(x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)=y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1m&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2m&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3m&lt;/sub&gt;+...+y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;nm&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;br&gt;

You can arrange these coefficients in a matrix

&lt;math&gt;M=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1m} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2m} \\
a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3m} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nm} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, if you have any vector 

&lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{j=1}^m x_j b_j&lt;/math&gt;,

Then

&lt;math&gt;T(x)=T(\sum_{j=1}^m x_j b_j)=\sum_{j=1}^m b_j T(x_j)=\sum_{j=1}^m b_j \sum_{i=1}^n y_i a_{ij}=\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij} b_j &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, T(x) is a linear combination of basis vectors

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n y_n c_i&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;c_i=\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij} b_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus knowledge of a matrix in respect to bases can determine the value of a the result of a linear transformation.

Thus, given any matrix, there is a corresponding function with the results being

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n y_n c_i&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;c_i=\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij} b_j&lt;/math&gt;.

This is obviously a linear operator, whose matrix coincides with the matrix used. This establishes the fact that every n by m matrix can determine a linear operator mapping an m dimensional vector space into an n dimensional vector space.

==Algebra of Transformations==

===Addition===
Define the sum C=A+B where A and B are linear transformations to be the function C(x)=A(x)+B(x). One can easily verify that this is also a linear transformation. You can verify that given two linear transformations A and B, that

#A+B=B+A
#(A+B)+C=C+(B+A)
#A+0=A
#A+(-A)=0

where 0 is the zero operator -A is the function -A(x) which one can easily verify to be a linear transformation.

===Scalar multiplication===

Given a linear transformation a, define the function &lt;math&gt;\mu A&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is an element of a field to be the function
&lt;math&gt;(\mu L)(x)= \mu (L(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

You can easily verify that given a linear transformations A and B and an elements of a field &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_2&lt;/math&gt;, that

#&lt;math&gt;\mu_1 (\mu_2 A) = (\mu_1 \mu_2)A&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; 1A=A &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; (\mu_1 + \mu_2)A = \mu_1 A + \mu_2 A&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt; \mu (A+B) = \mu A + \mu B &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that linear transformations form a vector space.

===Multiplication===

Given a linear transformation A from X to Y and a linear transformation B from Y to Z, then define the function AB from X to Z to be the composition of the two functions. One can easily verify that this is also a linear transformation.

Here are some useful relations that can easily be verified:

# &lt;math&gt; \mu (AB) = (\mu A)B&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; (A+B)C=AC+BC&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; C(A+B)=CA+CB&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; (AB)C=A(BC)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Corresponding algebra of matrices==

Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear transformations from m-dimension spaces to n-dimensional spaces and m-by-n matrices, the addition, scalar multiplication, and multiplication operations are defined in their one-to-one correspondence, and all properties stated above hold for matrices. The addition of matrices M and N can be defined as the matrix that corresponds to the sum m+n where m and n are the linear transformations that correspond to M and N respectively. The other operations are defined similarly.

=== Addition ===

Let A = |a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;| and B = |b&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;| be two matrices of dimension n by m. Consider '''A''' and '''B''' which are the corresponding linear transformations from an m-dimensional vector space M to an n-dimensional  vector space N. Let m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., m&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, be basis vectors of M and n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., n&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be basis vectors of N. Then

&lt;math&gt;A(m_i)=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} n_j &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B(m_i)=\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ij} n_j &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus

&lt;math&gt;(A+B)(m_i)=\sum_{j=1}^n(a_{ij}+b_{ij})n_j&lt;/math&gt;

so the matrix of this operator has entries |a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;+b&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;|. In other words, the sum of two matrices have entries that are the sum of the corresponding entries of the two matrices.

Examples:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 \\
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    1 &amp; 2
  \end{pmatrix}
+
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    7 &amp; 5 \\
    2 &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix}
=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1+0 &amp; 3+0 \\
    1+7 &amp; 0+5 \\
    1+2 &amp; 2+1
  \end{pmatrix}
=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 \\
    8 &amp; 5 \\
    3 &amp; 3
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Once addition is defined we have obviously also defined subtraction. A - B is computed by subtracting corresponding elements of A and B, and has the same dimensions as A and B. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 \\
    1 &amp; 0 \\    1 &amp; 2
  \end{pmatrix}
-
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    7 &amp; 5 \\
    2 &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix}
=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1-0 &amp; 3-0 \\
    1-7 &amp; 0-5 \\
    1-2 &amp; 2-1
  \end{pmatrix}
=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 3 \\
    -6 &amp; -5 \\
    -1 &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Scalar multiplication ===

Scalar multiplication of matrices shall be defined to be the corresponding matrix of the scalar product of the corresponding linear transformations.

Consider a matrix A with entries |a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;| and its corresponding linear transformation '''A''' from M to N, and an element of a field &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and let m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., m&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, be basis vectors of M and n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., n&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be basis vectors of N. Since

&lt;math&gt;(\mu A)(m_j)=\sum_{i=1}^m \mu a_{ij} n_i = \mu \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij} n_i&lt;/math&gt;, the entries of the corresponding matrix is has entries |&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;|.

 For example, multiplication by 2 of a matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 8 &amp; -3 \\
    4 &amp; -2 &amp; 5
  \end{pmatrix}
=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    2 \cdot 1 &amp; 2\cdot 8 &amp; 2\cdot -3 \\
    2\cdot 4 &amp; 2\cdot -2 &amp; 2\cdot 5
  \end{pmatrix}
=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    2 &amp; 16 &amp; -6 \\
    8 &amp; -4 &amp; 10
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Scalar Multiplication has the following properties, which have been proven because of its one-to-one correspondence to Linear Transformations:

# Left distributivity: (α+β)A = αA+βA. 
# Right distributivity: α(A+B) = αA+αB. 
# Associativity: (αβ)A=α(βA)). 
# 1A = A. 
# 0A= '''0'''. 
# (-1)A = -A.

=== Matrix multiplication ===

As above, matrix multiplication will also be defined as its correspondence to linear transformations. The product of two matrices is the corresponding matrices of the product of the corresponding two linear transformations.

Consider an o by n dimensional matrix A with entries |a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;|, n by m dimensional matrix B with entries |b&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;|, and let '''A''' be a linear transformation from n-dimensional M to o-dimensional O that corresponds to A, and let '''B''' be a linear transformation from m-dimensional N to n-dimensional N that corresponds to B, and let m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., m&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, be basis vectors of M, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., n&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, be basis vectors of N, o&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, o&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, o&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., o&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, be basis vectors of O. Then

&lt;math&gt;(AB)(m_i)=A(\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ji} n_j)=\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ji} A(n_j)=\sum_{j=1}^n b_{ji} \sum_{k=1}^o a_{kj} o_k = \sum_{k=1}^o (\sum_{j=1}^n a_{kj}b_{ji}) o_k&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the corresponding matrix has entries |p&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;| that are given by:

&lt;math&gt; p_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n  a_{ik} b_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
       -1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\times
    \begin{pmatrix}
        3 &amp; 1 \\
        2 &amp; 1 \\
        1 &amp; 0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
=
    \begin{pmatrix}

        ( 1 \times 3  +  0 \times 2  +  2 \times 1)
      &amp; ( 1 \times 1  +  0 \times 1  +  2 \times 0) \\

        (-1 \times 3  +  3 \times 2  +  1 \times 1)
      &amp; (-1 \times 1  +  3 \times 1  +  1 \times 0) \\

    \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:::::::: &lt;math&gt;
=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        5 &amp; 1 \\
        4 &amp; 2 \\
    \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Matrix multiplication diagram.svg|thumb|150 px|right|Matrix product]]

Matrix multiplication has the following properties, which have been verified due to the fact that they are also true of linear transformations.

# Associativity: A(BC) = (AB)C. 
# Left distributivity: A(B+C) = AB+AC. 
# Right distributivity: (A+B)C = AC+BC. 
# IA = A = AI. 
# α(BC) = (αB)C = B(αC).

Matrix multiplication is in general not commutative, i.e. there exist matrices for which AB &lt;math&gt;\ne&lt;/math&gt; BA. An example can be given by:
&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix} 7 &amp; 8 \\ 9 &amp; 10 \\ 11 &amp; 12 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The way matrix multiplication is defined seems illogical and strange; why can matrix multiplication not be defined as just multiplying corresponding entries as in the case of addition and scalar multiplication? Unfortunately the actual answer will be available to us only later on in Chapter 3. In the meantime we will satisfy ourselves by noting the advantage that matrix multiplication gives us by representing a linear system in ''matrix form''. This will be clear in the following section.  

At this point we see fit to make another definition. An n by n matrix A is ''invertible'' if and only if there exists a matrix B such that
:AB = I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = BA.
In this case, B is the ''inverse matrix'' of A, denoted by A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Clearly the inverse of the identity matrix is itself. We will study invertible matrices in detail later. 

One point more is to be noted here. The type of matrix multiplication when the product matrix is simply the matrix obtained by multiplying the corresponding entries of two equal dimension matrices also has a name. It is called the ''Hadamard product''. We shall not use this kind of multiplication. Throughout the book matrix multiplication will always refer to the matrix product defined above.

====Determinants of Products of Matrices (Binet's Theorem)====
 
In addition, the determinant is a ''multiplicative map'' in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) \,&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
This is generalized by the [[Cauchy-Binet formula]] to products of non-square matrices.

==Matrices and system of linear equations==

The concept of a matrix was historically introduced to simplify the solution of linear systems although they today have much greater and broad-reaching applications. Let's see how a linear system can be represented using a matrix. 

Consider a general system of m linear equations with n unknowns:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
a_{11} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{12} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{1n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_1      \\
a_{21} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{22} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{2n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_2      \\
\vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;              &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp;&amp; \;\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{m2} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{mn} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_m      \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

The system is equivalent to a matrix equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A\bold{x}=\bold{b}&lt;/math&gt;
where A is an m×n matrix, x is a column matrix with n entries, and b is a column matrix with m entries.
: &lt;math&gt;
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\bold{x}=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\bold{b}=
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 \\
b_2 \\
\vdots \\
b_m
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly our manner of defining matrix multiplication is used in representing the linear system in this fashion because now the product of the matrix A and the matrix x gives us precisely the matrix b.

Representing linear systems in this fashion also enables us to easily prove the following theorem:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted green;&quot;&gt;
''Theorem 1:'' Any system of linear equations has either no solution, exactly one solution or infinitely many solutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Proof:'' Suppose a linear system Ax = b has two different solutions given by X and Y. Then let Z = X - Y. Clearly Z is non zero and A(X + kZ) = AX + kAZ = b + k(AX - AY) = b + k(b - b) = b so that X + kZ is a solution to the system for every possible value of k. Since k can assume infinitely many values so clearly we have an infinite number of solutions.

== Exercises ==
''Hints to many of the exercises can be found at [[Famous Theorems of Mathematics/Algebra/Matrix Theory]].''

1. Let A and B be m &amp;times; matrices. Then:
:(i) &lt;math&gt;(kA)^T&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;kA^T&lt;/math&gt;
:(ii) &lt;math&gt;(A+B)^T = A^T + B^T&lt;/math&gt;
:(iii) &lt;math&gt;(AB)^T = B^TA^T&lt;/math&gt;

2. Let a ''triangular matrix'' be a square matrix with either all (i,j) entries zero for either i&lt;j (in which case it is called an ''lower triangular matrix'') or for j&lt;i (in which case it is called an ''upper triangular matrix''). Show that any triangular matrix satisfying &lt;math&gt;AA^T = A^TA&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix.

3. For a square matrix A show that:
:(i) &lt;math&gt;AA^T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A+A^T&lt;/math&gt; are symmetric
:(ii) &lt;math&gt;A-A^T&lt;/math&gt; is skew symmetric
:(iii) A can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric matrix, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(A+A^T)&lt;/math&gt; and a skew symmetric matrix &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(A-A^T)&lt;/math&gt;

4. Suppose A is a m&amp;times;n matrix and x is a n&amp;times;1 column vector. Show that if &lt;math&gt;x=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix}c_1 &amp; c_2 &amp;\cdots c_n \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c_j=\begin{pmatrix}A_{1j}\\A_{2j}\\\vdots\\A_{mj}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;Ax = x_1c_1+x_2c_2+\cdots x_nc_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is also expressed by saying that Ax is a ''linear combination of the columns of A''.

'''Latest Version:''' 9.2.2&lt;br/&gt;
'''Status:''' Ceased Development&lt;br/&gt;

The Apple Macintosh platform uses its own operating system known as Mac OS.  Subsequent releases of the operating system have been denoted by appending the version number, such as Mac OS 9.  With the advent of [[Subject:Mac OS|Mac OS X]] based on FreeBSD, previous versions have become known as Classic Mac OS and are no longer supported by Apple.  Despite the lack of support, many classic systems are still in use today.

== Graphical User Interface ==

Mac OS featured the first graphical user interface (GUI) on a mass produced computer ([http://xerox.com Xerox] produced the first GUI but it did not enter production). Many of the features of the original release of Mac OS are still implemented in modern operating systems, including:

* Icons
* Shortcuts
* Mouse usage
* Visual interactions (e.g. drag and drop)
* Windows, buttons and dialog boxes
* Boot directly into visual interface
* Cut-and-paste

The ability to interact graphically with the operating system significantly reduced the learning curve.  Initially many doubted the viability of the Macintosh for business applications, as the GUI was a significant departure from console based terminals.  This preconception was dispelled largely through the passage of time and the adoption of GUIs in several other operating systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Though perhaps other power sources can be used, the main sources of electrical power for robots are batteries and photovoltaic cells.  These can be used separately or together (for practical applications, most solar-powered robots will need a battery backup).

== Photo Voltaic Cells ==

Photo Voltaic Cells
 solar cells are well known for their use as power sources for satelites, enviromentalist green energy campaigns and pocket calculators. In robotics solar cells are used mainly in [[Robotics/Exotic Robots/BEAM|BEAM]] robots. Commonly these consist of a solar cell which charges a capacitor and a small circuit which allows the capacitor to be charged up to a set voltage level and then be discharged through the motor(s) making it move. 

For a larger robot solar cells can be used to charge its batteries. Such robots have to be designed around energy efficiency as they have little energy to spare.

== Batteries ==
Batteries are an essential component of the majority of robot designs.  Many types of batteries can be used.  Batteries can be grouped by whether or not they are rechargeable.

Batteries that are not rechargeable usually deliver more power for their size, and are thus desirable for certain applications.  Various types of alkaline and lithium batteries can be used.  Alkaline batteries are much cheaper and sufficient for most uses, but lithium batteries offer better performance and a longer shelf life.

Common rechargeable batteries include lead acid, nickel-cadmium (NiCd)and the newer nickel metal-hydride (Ni-MH).  NiCd &amp; Ni-MH batteries come in common sizes such as AA, but deliver a smaller voltage than alkaline batteries (1.2V instead of 1.5V).  They also can be found in battery packs with specialized power connectors. These are commonly called race packs and are used in the more expensive RC race cars.  They will last for some time if used properly. Ni-MH batteries are currently more expensive than NiCd, but are less affected by memory effect.

Lead acid batteries are relatively cheap and carry quite a lot of power, although they are quite heavy and can be damaged when they are discharged below a certain voltage. These batteries are commonly used as backup power supply in alarm systems and UPS.



An extremely common problem in robots is the &quot;the microcontroller resets when I turn the motor on&quot; problem[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/200001798].
When the motor turns on, it briefly pulls the battery voltage low enough to reset the microcontroller.
The simplest solution[http://www.jonh.net/~jonh//robots/skguide.html] [http://books.google.com/books?id=WrVOqUFGP9sC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=robot+reset+battery+motor&amp;source=web&amp;ots=uUNRRJssHI&amp;sig=5uWmfb08g4L_WhOhJVsi1j-UD_w] [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmcnaugh/kdc/as7/] [http://www.bluebelldesign.com/Power1.htm] is to run the microcontroller on a separate set of batteries.

----------------------------------------

'''HISTORY OF THE BATTERY:'''

The first evidence of batteries comes from discoveries in Sumerian ruins dating around 250 B.C.E. Archaeological digs in Baghdad, Iraq [http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm]. But the man most credited for the creation of the battery was named Alessandro Volta, who created his battery in the year 1800 C.E. called the voltaic pile. The voltaic pile was constructed from discs of zinc and copper with pieces of cardboard soaked in saltwater between the metal discs. The unit of electric force, the volt, was named to honor Alessandro Volta [http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_Alessandro_Volta.htm]. A time line of breakthroughs and developments of the battery can be seen here [http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbattery.htm].

'''HOW A BATTERY WORKS:'''

Most batteries have two terminals on the exterior, one end is a positive end marked “+” and the other end is the negative marked “-”. Once a load, any electronic device, a flashlight, a clock, etc., is connected to the battery the circuit being completed, electrons begin flowing from the negative to positive end, producing a current. Electrons will keep flowing as fast as possible until the chemical reaction on the interior of the battery lasts.
Inside the battery there is a chemical reaction going on producing the electrons to flow, the speed of production depends on the battery’s internal resistance. Electrons travel from the negative to positive end fueling the chemical reaction, if the battery isn’t connected then there is no chemical reaction taking place. That is why a battery (except Lithium batteries) can sit on the shelves for a year and there will still be most of the capacity to use. Once the battery is connected from positive to negative pole, the reaction starts, that explains the reason why people have gotten a burn when a 9-volt battery in their pocket touches a coin or something else metallic to connect the two ends, shorting the battery making electrons flow without any resistance, making it very, very hot. [http://www.howstuffworks.com/battery.htm]

'''MAIN CONCERNS CHOOSING A BATTERY:'''

:-         Geometry of the batteries. The shape of the batteries can be an important characteristic according to the form of the robots.
:-         Durability. Primary(disposable) or secondary (rechargeable)
:-         Capacity. The capacity of the battery pack in milliamperes-hour is important. It determines how long the robot will run until a new charge is needed.
:-         Initial cost. This is an important parameter, but a higher initial cost can be offset by a longer expected life.
:-	Environmental factors. Used batteries have to be disposed of and some of them contain toxic materials. [http://robocup.mi.fu-berlin.de/buch/chap6/ComparisonBattery.html]

'''PRIMARY (DISPOSABLE) BATTERY TYPES'''
:•	Zinc-carbon battery - mid cost - used in light drain applications 
:•	Zinc-chloride battery - similar to zinc carbon but slightly longer life 
:•	Alkaline battery - alkaline/manganese &quot;long life&quot; batteries widely used in both light drain and heavy drain applications 
:•	Silver-oxide battery - commonly used in hearing aids 
:•	Lithium Iron Disulphide battery - commonly used in digital cameras. Sometimes used in watches and computer clocks. Very long life (up to ten years in wristwatches) and capable of delivering high currents but expensive. Will operate in sub-zero temperatures. 
:•	Lithium-Thionyl Chloride battery - used in industrial applications, including computers and electric meters.  Other applications include providing power for wireless gas and water meters. The cells are rated at 3.6 Volts and come in 1/2AA, AA, 2/3A, A, C, D &amp; DD sizes. They are relatively expensive, but have a proven ten year shelf life. 
:•	Mercury battery - formerly used in digital watches, radio communications, and portable electronic instruments, manufactured only for specialist applications due to toxicity [http://www.medicbatteries.com/battery-dry-cell-dry-cells.aspx]

Helpful link comparing the most popular types of batteries in many different types of categories [http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Energy-tables.html] [http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Battery-Energy.html]

'''SECONDARY (RECHARGEABLE):'''

(Will be discussing the two most popular secondary batteries)

'''Lithium-ion Batteries:'''

Advantages:

These batteries are much lighter than non-lithium batteries of the same size. Made of Lithium (obviously) and Carbon. The element Lithium is highly reactive meaning a lot of energy can be stored there. A typical lithium-ion battery can store 150 watt-hours of electricity in 1 kilogram of battery. A NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) battery pack can store perhaps 100 watt-hours per kilogram, although 60 to 70 watt-hours might be more typical. A lead-acid battery can store only 25 watt-hours per kilogram. Using lead-acid technology, it takes 6 kilograms to store the same amount of energy that a 1 kilogram lithium-ion battery can handle. Huge difference!

Disadvantages:

Begin degrading once they are created, lasting only two or three years tops, used or not. 	Extremely sensitive to high temperatures, heat degrades battery even faster. If a lithium battery is completely discharged, it is ruined and a new one will be needed. Because of size and ability to discharge and recharge hundreds of times it is one of the most expensive rechargeable batteries. And a SMALL chance they could burst into flames (internal short, separator sheet inside battery keeping the positive and negative ends apart gets punctured). [http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/lithium-ion-battery.htm]

'''Alkaline Batteries:'''

The anode, the positive end, is made of zinc powder because the granules have a high surface area, increasing the rate of reaction and higher electron flows. It also helps limit the rate of corrosion. Manganese dioxide is use on the cathode, or the negative side, in powder form as well. And potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte in an alkaline battery. There is a separator inside the battery to separate the electrolyte between the positive and negative electrodes. [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-key-components-of-an-alkaline-battery.htm]

== Fuel Cells ==

Fuel cells are a possible future replacement for chemical cells (batteries). They generate electricity by recombining hydrogen gas and oxygen. (commercial fuel cells will probably use methanol or other simple alcohols instead of hydrogen).
Currently these are very expensive, but this might change in the near future when these cells are more commonly used as a replacement for laptop batteries.

'''Note:''' since fuel cells use flammable products you should be extra careful when you build a power source with these. Hydrogen has no odor like natural gas and is flammable and in some conditions explosive.

Pressurized canisters have their own set of risks. Make sure you really know how to handle these. Or at least allow other people enough time to get behind something thick and heavy before experimenting with these.

== Mechanical ==

Another way to store energy in a robot is mechanical means. Best known method is the wind-up spring, commonly used in toys, [http://www.leeselect.com/baygen/baygenamfmsw.htm radios] or [http://home.howstuffworks.com/inside-clock.htm clocks].

Another example of mechanical energy storage is the flywheel. A heavy wheel used to store kinetic energy.

== Air Pressure ==

Some robots use pneumatic cylinders to move their body. These robots can use either a bottle of pressurized air or have a compressor on board. Only the first one is a power source. The latter power source is the batteries powering the compressor.
Pneumatic cylinders can deliver very large forces and can be a very good choice for larger walkers or grippers.

'''Note:''' Pressurized canisters and pneumatic components can be dangerous when they are handled wrongly. Failing pressurized components can shoot metal pieces around. Although these aren't ''necessarily'' life threatening, they can cause serious injuries even at low pressures.

Canisters on their own pose additional risks: Air escaping from a pressurized canister can freeze whatever happens to be in its way. Don't hold any body parts in front of it.

Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders can deliver large forces. Your body parts can't handle large forces. You get the picture.love

== Chemical Fuel ==
For model airplanes there exist small internal combustion engines. These engines can be used to power robots either directly for propulsion or indirectly by driving an alternator or dynamo. A well designed system can power a robot for a very long time, but it's not advisable to use this power system indoors.

'''Note:''' This is another dangerous way of doing things. Fuel burns and is toxic. Small amounts of fuel in a open container can explode when ignited. Exhaust is toxic and a suffocation risk. Make sure of that you know what you're doing or get good life insurance.

Do you have a section on [[wikipedia:BEAM robotics|BEAM robotics]]? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 19:52, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I've added [[Robotics: Exotic Robots: BEAM|a section]] about BEAM robots. More special subtypes of robots could be added in &quot;exotic robots&quot; too.
--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 11:17, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

What is the general tone of the book supposed to be? A sort of do-it-yourself-and-see-what-happens, or a properly technical job? I quite like the way it's going now, a little informal but with all the key elements there (or spaces where they should be ;) ). Maybe a little synopsis of the book at the beginning could help, explaining its intended audience. Good work so far! --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 20:46, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I was thinking of keeping it somewhat in the middle. Doing a good technical job without expensive hardware. Preferably using only materials that are available to the common person. 
I think the book should have sections covering &quot;getting started with&quot; on working with metals and plastics; electronics and making PCBs; programming µcontrollers and PC; Basic AI (finding the way from point A to point B; simple neural nets,...). While the main focus should be on how to do this at home, it wouldn't hurt to add some info on how this is done in the industry. 
I'd also like to see more &quot;exotic&quot; robot ideas (e.g. completely mechanical, or completely pneumatic robots). At this point I'm adding everything related to robotics when I think of it. We can always (re)move content that goes too far out of the scope of this book. 
Ofcourse the other cowriters (If that's the correct word) may have other ideas. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 10:05, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I've been adding links from the subpages back to the main page. I used the  link structure that was already used in the microcontrollers section. I added a #&lt;topic&gt; to the original link to the main page. Now it returns to the main page and scolls to the subsection.

I've started up a book on [[Embedded Systems]], on the EE bookshelf that this book would probably benefit from linking to.

I would like to add a section on PID control and another on Fuzzy Logic, but am unsure where it would be appropriate to slot them in. I noticed that there is a section on [[Robotics: Computer Control: Control Architectures: Reactive Systems|Reactive Systems]]. Shall I put that there? [[User:Daleh|Daleh]] 16:09, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

If you intend to write on PID and fuzzy logic specific for robotics then sure, go ahead. If you mean a more generic text, it might fit in better in the [Electronics] wikibook, with a link to it on [[Robotics: Computer Control: Control Architectures: Reactive Systems|Reactive Systems]]. &lt;BR&gt;
Ofcourse either way would be great. And you could always move it later if it would be necessary. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 16:00, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

==Badly missing sections of the book==
The book is about ALL kinds of robotics, right? Right now it more looks like its title is &quot;Build your own robot&quot; than &quot;Robotics&quot; (not that it's a bad thing per se but the title doesn't describe the book). Especially I miss sections on industrial robots and AGVs, which are the main application of robotic technology in industry as far as I know. Also interesting subtopics as robotic cars, robot transporters, cooperation between robots, history of robotics, robot simulation, kinematics, sensors etc are badly covered, I think. When I get time, I'll try to work such sections in even though it's quite a lot of work. [[User:TERdON|TERdON]] 12:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

Till now most of the effort put in the book went into the DIY part of robotics, mostly because I lack real knowledge on industrial robotics and most contributers tend to extend subjects rather than introduce new subjects. It would be great if you could start on the industrial robots topic. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 16:03, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

== terminology ==

There seems to be a bit of inconsistent terminology.
I think the module
[[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Microcontrollers]]
defines the terms &quot;CPU&quot; and &quot;microcontroller&quot; correctly (perhaps because I wrote a big chunk of it).

Some pages, such as [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Computers]], imply that a &quot;computer&quot; is (narrow definition) a desktop PC or laptop PC (weighing at least 7 pounds) running some operating system that supports office applications.

While other pages of this book, such as [[Robotics#Resources]], imply all robots, by definition, include a &quot;computer&quot; (wide definition) -- even &quot;mini-class Sumo robots&quot; which must have a mass of 500 grams (1.1 pounds) or less.

I think we need to have 2 different terms for these 2 slightly different things.
(The wide definition certainly includes everything in the narrow definition, but it also includes a bunch of other things as well -- things that may be a better choice for installing on a robot).

Is there a more accurate term than [[w:multichip module]] for the sort of thing described in &quot;[[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: SBC and multichip modules]]&quot;?
(perhaps &quot;computer component&quot;[http://balloonboard.org/] or &quot;processor module&quot;[http://opencircuits.com/Linuxstamp] or &quot;microcontroller module&quot;[http://www.chip45.com/index.pl?page=Crumbs&amp;lang=en&amp;tax=0&amp;dest=2] or &quot;stamp&quot; ?)

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 06:00, 12 June 2007 (UTC)
''edited'' --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 14:27, 11 July 2007 (UTC)

I've replaced the term &quot;computer&quot; with &quot;PC&quot; on the page [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Computers]]. I propose to define the term &quot;computer&quot; as any electronic device that can execute a program. IMO we should use more accurat terms when possible.

Multichip module is a correct term. The difference between a microcontroller and a multichip module is that a microcontroller has a single chip which contains both processing and memory circuits, while a multichip module contains seperate chips for each of its functions, which are placed in the same package. I'd say to keep the term, since there is a quite large difference between a MCM and a microcontroller and IMO the MCM stands closer to a SBC than to a microcontroller.--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 06:00, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I agree that there is a difference between these &quot;processor modules&quot; and a microcontroller by itself.
But I'm a little fuzzy on where to draw the line -- or if there even is a line -- between these &quot;processor modules&quot; and a single board computer (SBC).
The motherboard PCB assembly in a desktop PC has &quot;seperate chips for each of its functions&quot; -- does that make it a multi-chip module MCM ?

== Naming Convention Cleanup ==

Here is a list of pages which are improperly named and need to be moved:

{{AutoTOC|Robotics:}}

== Robot Combat ==

Combat Robots could be a possible addition to the &quot;Exotic Robot&quot; section, and could tie in multiple spects of your book. What do you all think?

: Go for it. I want this book to grow large enough to completely cover every kind of robot, as well as cover things that are very similar to robots, such as remote-controlled combat robots that some purists might say are not &quot;really robots&quot; because they are not autonomous. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 19:48, 3 March 2014 (UTC)

== suggest move ==

I suggest moving the [[Robotics/Sensors/Thermal Sensors]] page out of this book into the [[Embedded Systems]] book.
Most of that information applies to *every* temperature sensing system, even ones that are completely non-moving.
Is there any robotics-specific information in that page that doesn't apply to such non-moving systems?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Though many components for a serious robotics project will almost certainly have to be purchased, the total cost of the project can be reduced by harvesting parts from various electronic and electro-mechanical devices.  The general rule for selection is &quot;the older, the better,&quot; as newer devices are now dominated by specialized ICs and [[w:Surface-mount_technology|surface mount]] components that builders might find difficult to use in their robots. SMD (Surface-mounted devices) can be used to create very small robots, if one has the tools and patience to work with them.

An example of a good source of parts would be a printer from the 1980s.  Without even disassembling such a printer, one can see all sorts of potentially useful components.  Additionally, several metal rods and plates contained in the printer may be used as structural parts for the robot, and even the plastic case itself could be used.

Old floppy disk drives and copy machines are also good sources for parts such as stepper motors, optocouplers or microswitches, regular components, machined metal rods and hardware. Hard disk drives have fewer usable parts but can still be a source.

However stepper motors from printers and copy machines tend to consume a lot of power and may not be as good for battery operated robots.

''Note to potential contributors: perhaps there could be a &quot;case studies&quot; section here, with examples of what can be obtained from a variety of devices.''

Because this module is about XML, the former is the better statement in context because HTML was designed to give information to renderrers about how to display the content, where as XML is more general -- effectively any meta data can be included with the 'main' content.

-Get ride of the highlights with different colors under &quot;Documents must be well-formed&quot;

-Unify the format for the emphasized words

-Have a button that links to the author guidelines page. The button moves with the screen on the left side, so a editor can click anytime to make sure that he or she is following the author guidelines. A &quot;back to&quot; button on the author guidelines page as well.

-Have a &quot;top&quot; button to go to the top of the page

-Have the learning objective box at the top of the page


==Revisions by editorial board - Moussa==

* We cut off some information. Are we assuming that the user as some knowledge of HTML or XHTML? The transition from HTML to XHTML is not too hard, so we do not need this mush info. 
* Contents can be shorter. The chapter is not that long, but the contents make it seem that way. We can use bullets on some parts instead of them being sub-sections in the contents.
* I don’t think a “guidelines button” is needed, people do not always go to the book to make changes, and it may be disturbing to some readers.
* The chapter has exercises that refer to chapter 5 and 6, I think it would be preferable to either write down what those exercises were about (just the relevant parts) or create new exercises. This is just to stay within the page instead of having to go back just to do exercises.
* The top button is a good idea; we just need to check if it is feature available in wiki.
* Yim we will need some clarification on “Unify the format for the emphasized words”. You mentioned the highlights, but it seems like you are talking about other ones

==Professor==
I think the general structure and content of this chapter is OK because it is not meant to teach XHTML and it is assumed readers already know HTML when they start the book. The proposed changes and comments upon them make sense.

[[user:Rick|rtw]] 19:20, 5 Feb 2006 (UTC)

==Final comments - Moussa==

Looks good. You can take out the highlights where it says &quot;incorrect&quot; and &quot;correct&quot;. I was not able to find the link to the validator. I think it would be a good idea to have it somewhere at the top and/or bottom. 
Good job !!


==Question-Kelly==
The link is under both exercises and answers. Do you still want me to add the link in the module?

== Browser guidelines / bugs / pitfalls? ==

I'd like to see a section for web developers regarding typical problems specific to XHTML, and how to solve them. E.g., how to include JavaScript in XHTML 1.1 without breaking in IE when serving as text/html to that browser, an example script to serve as application/xhtml+xml or text/html depending on browser capabilities, and an answer to why IE renders some valid XHTML pages in quirks mode.

I can start adding a few of these.

[[User:Engmark|Engmark]] 09:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== Validation ==

One important benefit of XHTML over HTML is that XHTML can be validated using an XML validating parser. Even though this chapter explicitly states creation of valid HTML documents as a learning objective, the only mention of validation in this article is in a single sentence at the end of the paragraph on HTML Tidy. Validation merits a heading, with brief text describing what a validator does, the link to the W3C validator, how to validate using Xerces, and a mention that many HTML authoring tools support validation.</text>

      <comment>/* Why Polarized Light Is Affected */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Optical Activity==
Optical activity describes the phenomenon by which chiral molecules are observed to rotate polarized light in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.  This rotation is a result of the properties inherent in the interaction between light and the individual molecules through which it passes.  Material that is either achiral or equal mixtures of each chiral configuration (called a '''racemic mixture''') do not rotate polarized light, but when a majority of a substance has a certain chiral configuration the plane can be rotated in either direction.

==What Is Plane Polarized Light?==
Polarized light consists of waves of electromagnetic energy in the visible light spectrum where all of the waves are oscillating in the same direction simultaneously.  Put simply, imagine a ray of light as a water wave, with crests and peaks.  All the peaks of a water wave point in the same direction (up, against gravity) pretty much at the same time.  Light is not usually this way - its peaks and troughs are often in random array, so one ray of light's peaks might point in a direction 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; opposite of another ray.  When all of the rays have their peaks pointing in the same direction - like all the waves in the ocean have peaks pointing up - then those rays of light are said to be polarized to one another.

[[Image:Linear polarization schematic.png|thumb|left|125px|The blue line represents an electromagnetic wave. The green and red lines are views of the wave from above and to the side. The purple line shows the angle of the wave as seen end-on.]]

[[Image:Animation polariseur.gif|thumb|right|150px|A polaroid filter allows light through only if the light is polarized at the same angle as the filter.]]

==Why Polarized Light Is Affected==
So why do chiral molecules affect only polarized light, and not unpolarized?  Well, they '''do''' affect unpolarized light, but since the rays have no particular orientation to one another, the effect can not be observed or measured.  We observe the polarized light rays being rotated because we knew their orientation before passing through the chiral substance, and so we can measure the degree of change afterwards.

What happens is this; when light passes through matter, e.g. a solution containing either chiral or achiral molecules, the light is actually interacting with each molecule's [[electron cloud]], and these very interactions can result in the rotation of the plane of oscillation for a ray of light.  The direction and magnitude of rotation depends on the nature of the electron cloud, so it stands to reason that two identical molecules possessing identical electron clouds will rotate light in the exact same manner.  This is why achiral molecules do not exhibit optical activity.

In a chiral solution that is not a racemic mixture, however, the chiral molecules present in greater numbers are configurationally equivalent to each other, and therefore each possesses identical electron clouds to its molecular twins.  As such, each interaction between light and one of these 'majority' molecule's electron clouds will result in rotations of identical magnitude and direction.  When these billions of billions of interactions are summed together into one cohesive number, they do ''not'' cancel one another as racemic and achiral solutions tend to do - rather, the chiral solution as a whole is observed to rotate polarized light in one particular direction due to its molecular properties.

==Enantiomers==
It is just such specificity that accounts for the optical isomerism of '''[[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/Enantiomers|enantiomeric compounds]]'''.  Enantiomers possess identical chemical structures (i.e. their atoms are the same and connected in the same order), but are mirror images of one another.  Therefore, their electron clouds are also identical but actually mirror images of one another and '''not''' superimposable.  For this reason, enantiomeric pairs rotate light by the same magnitude (number of degrees), but they each rotate plane polarized light in ''opposite'' directions.  If one chiral version has the property of rotating polarized light to the right (clockwise), it only makes sense that the molecule's chiral mirror image would rotate light to the left (counterclockwise).

Equal amounts of each enantiomer results in no rotation.  Mixtures of this type are called '''racemic''' mixtures, and they behave much as achiral molecules do.

== History ==

Via a magneto-optic effect, when a beam of polarized light passes through solution, the (-)-form of a moleculed rotates the plane of polarization counterclockwise, and the (+)-form rotates it clockwise. It is due to this property that it was discovered and from which it derives the name optical activity. The property was first observed by J.-B. Biot in 1815, and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals.

Louis Pasteur deduced in 1848 that the handedness of molecular structure is responsible for optical activity. He sorted the chiral crystals of tartaric acid salts into left-handed and right-handed forms, and discovered that the solutions showed equal and opposite optical activity.

Artificial composite materials displaying the analog of optical activity but in the microwave regime were introduced by J.C. Bose in 1898, and gained considerable attention from the mid-1980s.

'''Purpose:'''
#Provide a quick reference guide for electronic information searching.
#Teach information seekers how to form accurate searches in electronic environments.
'''Scope:''' Any electronic search environment.  Examples can be found in the &quot;Searches A-Z&quot; section of the book.

'''Audience:''' All information seekers in electronic environments.

==Reference Guide==
This reference guide quickly answers how to use various electronic searches. This may include an Internet search engine such as [[/Google/]] or [[/Yahoo/]], a library web catalog such as [[/Library of Congress/]], a personal computer file searcher such as [[/grep/]], or any other electronic search mechanism. Some knowledge of Boolean logic is helpful and if you don't know how to use the AND, OR, NOT operators, please read the Teaching How to Search section of this Wikibook.

Each search page should list Boolean operators, other operators, and available search fields as well as the purpose, audience, and scope of that search.

====Tweaking the Classic Mode of WP 12 to improve the emulation of WPDOS 5.1====
This section contains tips for tweaking Corel WordPerfect 12, so that Classic Mode emulates WP 5.1 for DOS more closely. For a more complete review of Classic Mode, see [[/WordPerfect 12/]].

The following abbreviations are used below:
*WP 12: Corel WordPerfect 12 (for Windows)
*WP 5.1: WordPerfect 5.1 DOS
WordPerfect 12 already has a 5.1 version setting in workspace manager under the tools menu.

====Entering Classic Mode====
When WP 12 starts for the first time, it will give you the choice to first select one of several emulation modes. If this choice is not presented, select Tools, Workspace Manager, Classic Mode.

====Tweaking Reveal Codes====
Select Tools, Settings, Display, Reveal Codes. Uncheck &quot;Use system colors&quot;. Change the text color to white, and the Background to DOS blue by chosing &quot;More&quot; and entering this color: (R,G,B=0,0,168). For an even closer WP 5.1 experience, change the font to Fixedsys. Note that this font cannot be adjusted in size, and may be too small. If necessary, try Courier New. When you have chosen View, Zoom, &quot;Margin width&quot; you should use a font of about 14 to match a font size in your document of 12. Uncheck &quot;Show spaces as bullets&quot;.

====Tweaking the Application Bar====
Right-click on the Application Bar at the bottom of the window and choose Settings. Uncheck Digital Signature. Check Num Lock State. Uncheck Printer. Uncheck Shadow Cursor On/Off. Double click on the Num Lock icon to change it to NUM. Double click on the AB icon to change it to CAPS. Drag CAPS completely to the right. Drag Insert/Typeover (General Status) completely to the left.

====Tweaking the menu bar====
''Still to be written''

===Reverting to the default settings for Classic Mode===
This section explains how to revert to the default settings for Classic Mode. (This is necessary because not all initial settings can be preserved by saving to a template. Templates contain changes made in Settings (Shift-F1), Customize, but not Settings (Shift-F1), Display.)

====Un-tweaking Reveal Codes====
Select Tools, Settings, Display, Reveal Codes. Check &quot;Use system colors&quot;. Check &quot;Show spaces as bullets&quot;. Select Font, Arial, 10.

====Un-tweaking the Application Bar====
Right-click the Application Bar at the bottom of the window and choose Settings. Check Digital Signature. Uncheck Num Lock State. Check Printer. Check Shadow Cursor On/Off. Double click the NUM icon to change it to a Num Lock icon. Double click CAPS to change it to the AB icon. Drag CAPS completely to the left. Drag Insert/Typeover (General Status) to the left of the position (Combined Position).

===Wish list for Corel to improve WP 5.1 emulation===
This wish list includes:
* a wider range of variable size display fonts such as Courier New, a variable height version of Fixedsys, and possibly others as well;

* being able to customise the foreground and background colors for the various font styles (bold, underline etc) (although this can be simulated with macros it's hard to do, and the document and Reveal Codes screen become cluttered with extra codes);

* not having Feature 34288 in Tools, Settings, Customize, Keyboards behind keys that invoke a WP 5.1 menu, and having the name of the menu item there instead;

* being able to display a traditional WP 5.1 application bar at the bottom of the screen, which can include non-WP 5.1 functions at the right hand end (perhaps someone will make this and Corel will put it on their website).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Pronunciation==
The Italian alphabet has the same letters as the English alphabet, but native Italian words do not use ''j'', ''k'', ''w'', ''x'', or ''y''; these letters are only used in foreign words, e.g. ''un '''w'''his'''ky''''', ''il '''j'''azz''.  

Pronunciation is different from English. Voiceless consonants normally have very little aspiration, stressed vowels are not &quot;automatically&quot; diphthongized as in English ''b'''oa'''t'' or ''b'''ai'''t'', and the distinction between long and short consonants, which is essential in Italian, does not exist in English.   

The Italian ''r'' is quite different from English ''r''. It is rolled, and can be formed by placing one's tongue on the roof of one's mouth just behind the teeth as if one is trying to pronounce a ''d''.

The letter ''l'' is pronounced keeping the tongue against the upper teeth.

There are two consonantic phonemes absent in English.
The letter pair ''gn'' represents a sound similar to Spanish ''ñ'' in ''se'''ñ'''or''.
The letter pair ''gl'', if followed by an ''i'' or an ''e'', represents a sound similar to ''ll'' in ''mi'''ll'''ion''. 

The letter ''h'' is not pronounced.
Its prime purpose in writing is to distinguish some forms of the verb ''avere'' (&quot;to have&quot;) from other words with the same pronunciation, and to signal the pronunciation of ''c'' and ''g'' as &quot;hard&quot; when followed by ''i'' or ''e''. 

Double consonants are regarded as split between two syllables: ''fanno'' (&quot;they do&quot;) is pronounced [{{IPA|'fan.no}}]. If you say &quot;ten nails&quot; quickly (rather than &quot;ten ales&quot;), you'll replicate the sound rather closely.

There are nine vocalic phonemes corresponding to the letters '''''a''''', '''''e''''', '''''i''''', '''''o''''', and '''''u'''''.

All vowels are normally short, except for stressed vowels in an open syllable (i.e. a syllable that ends in the vowel). Both vowels in ''fatto'' [{{IPA|'fatto}}] are short, for example, whereas the /{{IPA|a}}/ in ''fato'' [{{IPA|'faːto}}] is longer. 

They are:
* ''a'': like the ''a'' in &quot;f'''a'''ther&quot;.
* open ''e'': like ''e'' in &quot;b'''e'''t&quot;.
* closed ''e'':  like ''a'' in &quot;m'''a'''in&quot;.
* vocalic ''i'':  like ''e'' in &quot;w'''e'''&quot;.
* semiconsonantic ''i'':  like ''y'' in &quot;'''y'''oga&quot;.
* open ''o'':  like ''o'' in &quot;g'''o'''t&quot; (in a British English accent) or the ''ou'' in th''ou''ght (in a General American accent).
* closed ''o'':  like the ''o'' in &quot;b'''o'''il&quot;.
* vocalic ''u'':  like ''u'' in &quot;J'''u'''ne&quot;.
* semiconsonantic ''u'':  like ''u'' in &quot;q'''u'''ake&quot;.

Usually ''y'' is pronounced like ''i''.

The letters ''c'' and ''g'' change sound when they're followed by the letter ''e'' or ''i''. They become 'soft' before ''e'' and ''i'', like the English ''ch'' and ''g'', respectively – think of the words &quot;China&quot; and &quot;gem&quot; for an idea of the sound.  Otherwise, they have a 'hard' sound, like the English ''k'' in &quot;kite&quot;, and the English ''g'' in &quot;'''g'''ain&quot;.  In order to make these hard sounds even when ''e'' or ''i'' follow, the letter ''h'' is added between the  ''c'' or ''g'' and the ''i'' or ''e''.

The Italian language is phonetically regular (that is, words are pronounced as they are spelt), however it has some quirks common to the Romance languages (changing ''C'' and ''G'' sounds, for example).

Italian has no letters, digraphs, or trigraphs that are especially hard to pronounce for speakers with experience in other Romance languages, nor does it have an exceptional number of phonemes. However, students whose native language is English should pay close attention to the vowels: there are no lax vowels in Italian.

Don't be afraid of trying to pronounce the words using the ''approximate English'' pronunciations below (or the IPA if you are familiar with it). The Italian plosives are not aspirated, i.e. you should not blow much air when you pronounce ''d'', ''t'', ''b'', ''p'', ''k'', hard ''c'', or hard ''g''). The ''approximate English'' below indicates stressed syllables with capital letters. And now for all of this in more detail:

==Special considerations==
When trying to pronounce the words below, try to remember the following:

*Certain words have double consonants. Unlike in English, those consonants are phonemically ''geminated consonants''. That means you must pronounce a double consonant with more energy, giving more length to the sound. As an alternative, try pronouncing them separately but with less pause between the two.
:Example: ''coppia'' (KOP-pyah) [{{IPA|'kɔppja}}], &quot;couple&quot;
*&quot;H&quot; is silent (see below).
*&quot;I&quot; can also be silent (see below).
*Stress is on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable in most cases.

==Single letters==
In the following explanation &quot;hard vowels&quot; (vocali dure) refers to 'a', 'o' and 'u', and &quot;soft vowels&quot; (vocali morbide) refers to 'e' and 'i'.
; A : &quot;A&quot; is pronounced like in &quot;f'''a'''ther&quot;.
:Example: ''amici'' (ah-MEE-chee) [{{IPA|a'miːtʃi}}], &quot;friends&quot;
; B : &quot;B&quot; is pronounced like in &quot;'''b'''alloon&quot;, but without aspirating air.
:Example: ''bianco'' (BYAHN-ko) [{{IPA|'bjaŋko}}], &quot;white&quot;
; C : Before soft vowels (''e'' and ''i''), &quot;C&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;'''ch'''urch&quot;. Elsewhere, it is pronounced as in &quot;'''c'''ar&quot;.
:Example soft sound: ''ciao'' (TCHAH-o) [{{IPA|'tʃaːo}}], &quot;hello&quot;/&quot;hi&quot;

; J : &quot;J&quot; does not exist in modern Italian spelling, except in loanwords in which it can be pronounced [{{IPA|j}}], [{{IPA|ʒ}}] or [{{IPA|dʒ}}]. A few Italian words can still be spelt with an initial &quot;J&quot; as an alternative to &quot;I&quot;.
:Example: ''jattanza'' (dated) or ''iattanza'' [{{IPA|jat'tantsa}}], &quot;haughtiness&quot;

:Example voiced: ''zero'' (DZEH-roh) [{{IPA|'dzɛːro}}], &quot;zero&quot;
:Example devoiced: ''pizza'' (PEET-tsa) [{{IPA|'pittsa}}], &quot;pizza&quot;
:The only minimal pair that exists is ''razza'' [{{IPA|'rattsa}}] &quot;race&quot;, [{{IPA|'raddza}}] &quot;ray fish&quot;, but many Italians might use [{{IPA|'rattsa}}] for both.

==Di/Trigraphs==
Digraphs or trigraphs are not diphthongs, rather they are two letters representing a single sound.
Italian has one digraph and two trigraphs with peculiar sounds to English speakers.

; GN : &quot;GN&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ny&quot; in &quot;ca'''ny'''on&quot;, like the &quot;nh&quot; sound in the Portuguese word &quot;sonho&quot; or like &quot;ñ&quot; in the Spanish word ''pi'''ñ'''ata''. It is always long (geminated) between vowels, within a word or in connected speech.
:Example: ''agnello'' (ah-NNYEH-lloh) [{{IPA|aɲ'ɲɛllo}}], &quot;lamb&quot;
; GL before I : &quot;GL&quot; before &quot;I&quot; is pronounced similarly to the &quot;lli&quot; in &quot;mi'''lli'''on&quot; or the 'lh' sound in the Portuguese word &quot;filha&quot;. Between vowels it is always long (geminated).
:Example: ''figlio'' (fee-llyoh) [{{IPA|'fiʎʎo}}], &quot;son&quot;. This sound has the same tongue position as [{{IPA|l}}] but the manner of articulation is as in [{{IPA|j}}]
:There are some notable exceptions: ''glicine'' [{{IPA|'gliːtʃine}}] &quot;wisteria&quot;, and some words that come from the Greek root &quot;glyk&quot;, such as &quot;glicerina&quot; [{{IPA|glitʃe'riːna}}] &quot;glycerin&quot;.
; SC before I and E : &quot;SC&quot; is pronunced as &quot;sh&quot; in &quot;'''sh'''oot&quot; when it precedes an &quot;i&quot; or an &quot;e&quot;. Between vowels it is always long (geminated).
:Example: ''pesce'' (PEH-sheh) [{{IPA|'peʃʃe}}], &quot;fish&quot;; ''sciare'' (shee-AH-reh) [{{IPA|ʃi'aːre}}], &quot;to ski&quot;

==I and h==
H can be used between 'c', 'g', 'sc' and a soft vowel indicating that they must be pronounced as if they were followed by a hard vowel.
:Example: ''ghetto'' (GEH-tto) [{{IPA|'getto}}], &quot;ghetto&quot;

In the same way, &quot;I&quot; can be used between 'c', 'g', 'sc' and a hard vowel indicating that they must be pronounced as if they were followed by a soft vowel.
:Example: ''bacio'' (BAH-cho) [{{IPA|'baːtʃo}}], &quot;kiss&quot; (noun)
Note that there are also words in which &quot;i&quot; is pronounced:
:Example: ''sciare'' can be pronounced [{{IPA|ʃi'aːre}}] &quot;to ski&quot; or [{{IPA|'ʃaːre}}] &quot;lava plains&quot;.

==Accents and stresses==
Each word has one stressed syllable, usually the penultimate.
An accent can be used to mark a stressed vowel.
The accent is mandatory 
*when the stress is on the last syllable
:Example: ''città'' (chih-TAH) [{{IPA|tʃit'ta}}], &quot;city&quot;
*on some one-syllable long words which have homophones.
:Example: ''da'' &quot;from&quot;, ''dà'' &quot;he/she/it gives&quot;

When the stress is on a syllable other than the last, the accent isn't mandatory and it is never used, but it can be optionally employed to disambiguate homographs. Dictionaries may use the accent in order to show the pronunciation: the lack of accent means accent on the penultimate.
A significant example of possible disambiguation is that of ''principi'': ''prìncipi'' (PREEN-chee-pee) [{{IPA|'printʃipi}}], &quot;princes&quot; vs. ''princìpi'' (preen-CHEE-pee) [{{IPA|prin'tʃiːpi}}], &quot;principles&quot;. However, this can also be done by writing ''princìpi'' as ''principî'', though this spelling is becoming rare.

When the accent is present it also carries information about the pronunciation of &quot;e&quot;
An acute accent over the &quot;E&quot; (i.e. ''é'') indicates a [[w:Close-mid front unrounded vowel|closed]] &quot;E&quot;, while a grave accent (i.e. ''è'') means that the &quot;E&quot; is [[w:Open-mid front unrounded vowel|open]].

Examples:
&quot;E&quot;: ''perché'' (pair-KEH) [{{IPA|per'keh}}], &quot;why&quot; &quot;because&quot;; ''tè'' (TEH) [{{IPA|tɛ}}], &quot;tea&quot;

In handwriting, the difference between the two accents is not usually respected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Vision, Mission, Scope &amp; Concept ==

I took the liberty to insert this as a new topic at the beginning of this discussion page, although the topic is not new. I am badly missing an &quot;authoritative&quot; definition of the scope and concept of this book. Such information should be first on this discussion page - where you now read this question - and probably at the book's start page, too.

Would someone please step forward, grasp the authority, appoint himself/herself as the leader (at least for a day), and define the principles for the contents of this book? I am not asking for yet another scope, TOC, whatever discussion. I am asking for a decision, definition, &quot;final answer&quot;, consensus, which IMHO is badly needed as the basis for the work:


:* Type of the book? Reference, textbook, self-study course, (application) note collection, tutorial, experiment instructions, etc.?  
:* What difficulty level? Beginner, intermediate, advanced level? And
::* level for whom? Hobbyist, professional, college, universiy, scientist? (an advanced level for a hobbyist is something completely different than one for university).
:* What scope? Where to start? Where to end?

Publish this information here, so people can decide if this is the right book they want/can contribute to, or that they should probably do another book.

&lt;center&gt;Please, '''DON'T DISCUSS''', please '''DECIDE'''.&lt;/center&gt;

==People working on this book==
Name: Goals. What you are working on? Any requests?

[[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]: I am currently working on the background for this book at [[Physics in English]].

[[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]: I always wanted to learn electronics when I was a little kid, but none of the books I read provided me with consistent, understandable, correct information.  In sixth grade we covered Ohm's law and I was dismayed when my teacher said I would have to wait til college to learn the rest. :-)  Now I have my bachelor's in electrical engineering and I want to help write something that is clear and correct.  You shouldn't HAVE to wait til college if you are interested in something enough...  On the other hand, I'm one of the people who adds calculus equations.  :-)  We'll sort it all out eventually...  I also make diagrams using [http://www.qsl.net/wd9eyb/klunky/framed.html klunky schematic drawer], which I have modified and advertise prominently despite not really caring if you use it.  I just like it.  See [[Electronics/Template#Modified Klunky]] for the modified (improved?) version.

[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] :I wrote the GCSE electricity book. I don't know a great deal about electronics, but I do know physics. I intend to copy edit, correct physics misconceptions and the like. I am also resonably adept at drawing diagrams. Let me know if there is anything you want drawn.

[[User:maxpower|maxpower]]: Working on a BS.EE.  Suffered through some awful textbooks, want to give something back and help with a simpler, more concise electronics/circuits text.  Working on filling in the gaps rather than editing, for the most part.

[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]]: There's tons of fun electronics stuff that a high-schooler could afford to buy all the parts, and understand well enough to *build*. I'd like this book to inspire people to *build* stuff rather than think this is some sort of &quot;rocket science&quot;. I have a BS.EE., so I've also suffered through confusing, misleading explanations. There was no reason for me to suffer through learning Laplace Transforms before building my first simple blinky-light. I'm still trying to really ''understand'' Maxwell's equations and how they relate to [[Wikipedia:en:special relativity]].

[[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]]: I added the Section [[Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power|Voltage, Current, and Power]] to the &lt;strike&gt;Chapter&lt;/strike&gt; module [[Electronics/Basic Concepts|Basic Concepts]] in the Electronics book.  Up till now, the Chapter stood there pretty much empty.  A previous attempt tried to describe Voltage in terms of Coulomb's Law and Electric Field but was too mathematical and apparently not used.  I'm thinking of &lt;strike&gt;moving the Charge and Coulomb's Law section to the beginning chapter and&lt;/strike&gt; replacing the glossary in the Introductory chapter or merging it with Definitions.  The glossary now stands at the beginning as an un-numbered module.  I have almost finished writing* and made the [[Electronics/Charge and Coulomb's Law]] section previously in [[Electronics/Basic Concepts|Basic Concepts]] its own separate module as the first ordered module in the book.  I made [[Electronics/Basic Concepts|Basic Concepts]] redirect to [[Electronics/Voltage, Current, and Power|Voltage, Current, and Power]] which I plan to polish up.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;I also copied most of the content in the sections on Coulomb's Law and Electric Field into an empty module in [[Modern Physics]] called [[Modern Physics:Coulomb's Law and Electric Field|Coulomb's Law and Electric Field]].&lt;/small&gt;

*I only wrote the last two sections in that module.  Other members wrote all previous sections.[[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]]

[[User:Y0ssarian|Yossarian]] : I am currently in an Electronics Engineering MSc, and would like to help out if I can. I like what I am hearing here on the talk page about more how-to elements, and possibly the best way to get people started would be a tutorial in electronics EDA (preferrably open source) to allow people who might not have the equiptment have a play around with circuits. I wrote some of the stuff on basic gates, and am continuing to work on the digital circuits section.

[[User:Sraevsky|Sraevsky]] I have a BSEE, and I am interested in putting a little time into this book.  We'll see what happens, though.  Right now I'm very busy trying to finish up a law degree.

[[User:Filip Dominec|Filip Dominec]]: I would like to 
#help writing text and synchronize it with the czech project at http://cs.wikibooks.org/
#upload some electronic diagrams to Commons 
#change the main page to something like [http://cs.wikibooks.org/wiki/Praktick%C3%A1_elektronika]

==Thanks==
* To those who have contributed to Wikipedia, as large parts of this book are base on the things they have written.

* Theresa Knott, who wrote the GCSE Science book.

* The maker of Klunky, the ever useful circuit diagram maker.

* Everyone who has contributed to this book.

== GCSE Electricity ==
If someone could help merge the basic GCSE electricity textbook parts into here, it would be GREATLY appreciated.

:Where is that? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

::It is right here: [[GCSE Science/Electricity]] - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

So, we're moving everything from
[[GCSE Science/Electricity]]
to
[[Electronics]]
?

So
[[Electronics]]
is just one chapter in the
[[GCSE_Science]]
book ?
So I can move stuff back and forth until I find a place that &quot;fits&quot;, and delete redundancies between them ?
-- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 03:58, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)

What about [[FHSST_Physics_Electrostatics:Charge]] ?

== Common Misconceptions ==
I will list these here.  Feel free to add to them.  I want to put little marks next to each one when it has been covered in the book.  Or we can make uncovered ones bold or something

* Direction of current flow
** electron current vs. conventional current
** charge carriers, holes, etc. etc. etc. 
** I thought in terms of electron flow because I thought it was more &quot;correct&quot;.  But in reality neither is &quot;correct&quot; (current flow in salt water for example) and conventional current is much easier to think in terms of, precisely because it is the convention.
** voltage and current have polarity, not just magnitude
* Fundamental ideas of voltage, 
** current, 
** resistance [[Image:100%.png]]
** (water pipe analogies? pressure, flow, constriction etc.)
** &quot;voltage&quot; is a useful myth, but it is not single-valued in a changing magnetic field. I wonder if it would make things easier to understand if we explain stuff in terms of real, measurable quantities such as &quot;electrons&quot; and &quot;electric field&quot;.
* Speed of electron drift vs electric fields and waves (speed and motion of electrons themselves, speed of a signal is not actually the speed of light, electrons don't travel at the speed of light down the wires and back)
* I thought capacitors charged up until dielectric breakdown, and that this was normal.  I thought this was the principle behind timer circuits.  this is more like a spark gap.
* capacitors only charge up to the voltage supplying them.
* I figured out that RC circuits had something to do with timers but I couldn't figure out how
* Transistor is like a resistor that changes value with an input.  i read that a transistor is an amplifier and that didn't make any sense to me.  i never grasped it.
* I didn't understand transistors, but i understood &quot;thyristors&quot; as the electronic switches I wanted to use, even though a transistor can be used as a switch quite easily.  transistors were not explained very well.
* I was intimidated by ICs and basically ignored their existence.  i think becuase they didnt explain how a transistor was actually made, and how it could be expanded to a darlington transistor, and then to a chip with lots of transistors on one piece of silicon.
* digital logic was not explained well at all.  logic levels are specific voltages within a certain range, open outputs, pull up resistors, etc.
* idealized circuit diagrams vs circuit layout diagrams (battery symbol vs perfect voltage source with source resistance)
* I moved the 'Decoder and Encoders' to 'Digital to Analog &amp; Analog to Digital Converters' as the description did matches these devices instead of the all digital devices that decoders/encoders are. Unfortunately I am still figuring out editing here so I was unable to add a description for those devices.

== Combine topics? ==
It seems that there are too many topics in the TOC.  Do resistors, inductors and capacitors really have to be separate topics?  Can't we merge some topics, especially under DC electronics?

:I'd have to agree. It's good to keep the book modular like this so people won't have to dig around much to find what they're looking for. Besides, capacitors, resistors and inductors are some pretty important and widely used components.  - [[User:Alex S|Alex S]]

== Another electronics wiki ==
Another electronics wiki:
http://electronicschat.org/echatwiki/  This link dead Aug 22, 2008, if it's still dead in a few months, delete it...

== Focus of this book ==
This is basically turning into a shoddy mirror of various Wikipedia articles.  We need to develop a sort of &quot;What the Electronics wikibook is not&quot; to focus people towards writing useful information.  I don't see why we can't link to the appropriate wikipedia article for each component/section instead of parroting it here, so the reader can look there for detailed information.  Then we can focus on the ''how to'' aspects of electronics, which isn't covered in wikipedia and is the point of this book.  The book is to teach you basic electrical engineering:  how to design and build electronic circuits, not to describe the physics behind them in depth or various bleeding-edge technologies.  That's what encyclopedia articles are for.  The wikibook should have more how-to, more examples, more teaching, and less barely-related information. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 18:43, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I agree to some degree but the point of an Electronics is an explanation of how circuits work.  For instance, may be this is a once off case, the Op Amps article at wikipedia is nothing short of superb but it does not cover the analysis of Op Amps that an Electronics text book would.  Things like mesh  and nodal analysis, superposition theorem aren't covered either.  Ok Diagnostic Equipment or Measuring Instruments, which incidentally appears to be a mirrored page, should in all likelihood be just be links unless some of the information is more important.  But I think virtually the rest should probably be left because the purpose of this book is more different to an encyclopedia, an encyclopedia what it is.  This text book explains how it is used.  Which now that I've said it appears to be supporting you, but wikipedia is often at a quite a high level.  A level that might be too high for this text book. -[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 11:40, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I agree.  Op-amps are a huge subject, and most of the wikipedia information ''should'' be included in this book.  But we need to cover a lot more about them.  I'm talking more about stuff like [[Electronics/Resistors#.26rho.3B:_Resistivity_of_the_Material]]. ( Not that I think it should be deleted, but we should be focusing on more practical stuff.) - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

::: That belongs in a Electrical circuits book but is too low level for an Electronics book.  So yes it properly shouldn't be deleted. --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 22:04, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Now that I've written that. I agree that we need to focus on more how to, more examples.  The only problem is that wikipedia, the wikipedia article sometimes have too much information. Is this a digital or analog electronics text book?  --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 11:40, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::It's an introduction to both.  I think we should remove the stubby modules about things like [[Electronics/ALU]]s to the talk page until we have finished the basics like Ohm's law.  Let's finish what we have before we start adding all kinds of advanced subjects. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 13:36, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: I agree that we should finish the lower level stuff before carrying on.  But what level of completion is required?  75%, 50% and in whose opinion?  Another Question is: does nodal and mesh analysis matter, It is definitely a part of Electrical circuits theory and I could write it after some revision but it is seldom used in Electronics.  More often a less complete more directed analysis is done of electrical circuits. Someone has to assess the development stages.  I also agree that the stubby pages can be removed to the talk pages.--[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 22:04, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Separate issue how should the Diagnostic Equipment and Electronics/Measuring Instruments be consolidated.  Just a deletion of the less informative one or an integration of the information.  --[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 22:04, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

In order to get a more functional textbook like 'feel' to this. I think a worthwhile addition would be a section containing real functional curciut designs starting at a basic level and moving onto more advanced circuit.
For example, the first section could be &quot;A voltage regulator&quot;. This would contain a circuit diagram, an etching pattern, an explanation of how and why it works. As well as an explanation of any unusual/ambiguous configurations. --I don't have an account yet (KronicD).

== Where to get circuit diagrams ==
Check here for pictures: [[commons:Category:Electrical_diagrams]].  Everything I have ever made (including the common base, etc. diagrams) is up there now, and there are tons of diagrams I didn't make.  If you are thinking of a diagram, there is probably one there already.  

You can make a link to them and they will be transwikied automatically:

== Where to get components for drawing circuit diagrams ==

[[Image:Sine_sqare_triangle_generator_blocks.svg|thumb|Example of a schematic using this list (sine/square/triangle generator)]]

You can use components from this image:

[[Image:Electrical_symbols_library.svg|thumb|300px|center|Electrical_symbols_library.svg]]

It is intended to make drawing of schematics simple, fast and still very flexible, using common vector image editors (as [[w:Inkscape]]). 

All components are ''snapped to 1 mm grid'' (turn on &quot;node snapping&quot;). Feel free to edit and replace with new version. --[[User:Filip Dominec|Filip Dominec]] 13:12, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

== Merging [[LearnElectronics]] ==
since the aim of both books is the same I'm supposed to merge my book with this one, however as it is hands on and simplistic I don't see how i can merge it with this one. I want the reader to be able to start creating there own electronics very quickly and i only go over basic thoery and equations (Ohm's law and power=volts*current), your book goes over advanced theories and equations that i feel the reader doesn't need to know about when they first start. 

does anyone agree with reordering this book so learnelectronics can fit without a lot of advanced talk?

:[[User:V2os|V2os]] has started the book called [[LearnElectronics]] (or at least contributed to it). I added a merge tag to the book, because it appeared to have similar aims to that of [[Electronics]]. After some discussion, I decided to remove the tag for the time being. But, it would be great if contributes to this book would provide some guidance, so that we can ensure that duplication of material is kept to a minimum. Maybe the addition links between the two books would help. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:42, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

I guess we should somehow link both books close together. However I'm not sure if a merge would be the best way. IMHO learn electronics would be aimed at a high school level, while this book is more of a college level book. Perhaps we can get both books to interface with eachother so that learnElectronics would be the beginners introduction to electronics and this book would follow up as a more indepth study? --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 15:38, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

I think the books should be merged.  I don't like multiple projects with the same goals.  Contribution to the Electronics book is patchy enough already.  Also there's [[Electricity (;)]] for introductory stuff.  

I don't see any reason why we can't format this in a way that people can start building circuits without learning the advanced theory behind it. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 16:19, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

Deciding the desired scope of the book I think is the absolute biggest problem we have.  On the one hand, some want a book that just tells how to build very simple light bulb and switch circuits with no theory at all.  On the other hand, we had a contributor at one point that had an Analog Circuits chapter with subheadings ''Sound'', ''Brief History of the Universe'', ''The Solar System'', ''Evolution of the Earth's Atmosphere'', ''Earthquakes and natural disasters'', and ''Global Warming''.

The Wikipedia doesn't have this problem because it just breaks everything up into individual subjects instead of trying to wrap them up and present them in a teaching order.  If you want details, you read other articles that have details.  If you want basics, you just read article introductions.

I think the point of this Wikibook should be to focus on the practical &quot;how-to&quot; aspects that Wikipedia doesn't provide, and present the information in order.  For theory, just link to Wikipedia articles.  

On the other hand, I think it's important to know what the electron fluid is actually doing to be able to design circuits yourself instead of just building from schematics that are provided to you, which is why I was including the concepts of charge in the introductory chapter.  I think it's important to think about the charge that flows between two electrostatically charged objects to really understand how it flows in a circuit.  We don't need to include any equations for this part at all, but the descriptions I read when I was younger &quot;dumbed it down&quot; so much that I really didn't understand what was actually going on.  I always tried to think of circuits in terms of electron flow instead of conventional current because &quot;that's what's actually flowing!&quot;  It hampered my understanding a lot.  (I see people do this online sometimes and it annoys me.)

I'm sure there's a way to present simple circuits that people can build without actually reading the text, while still providing useful information for people who want to read it, and defer all the advanced theory to the Wikipedia articles. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 19:30, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

You could seperate each section so that the basic information needed for understanding is at the top under a &quot;basic information for understanding&quot; heading and then another heading saying &quot;advanced understanding&quot; after that --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 21:50, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

:: If you think that will get the book back on track, be bold, you don't need to get permission. As Omegatron said, Wikibooks are really slow. You shouldn't be afraid of jumping in and getting your hands dirty, because explaining electronics to others is a good way of showing that you understand it yourself.

::I agree that this book could stand a serious reorganization, but I am worried about what you mean by &quot;used by high school level readers.&quot;  I would say that the book in it's current form is a bit heavy on the theory (most of the &quot;charge and coulombs law&quot; chapter for instance) but some theory would be very helpful.  I may have been a bit slow at the mathematics, but I did not understand much calculus in high school, but I would definately question the usefulness of this book if it didn't include basic equations to model capacitors, inductors, et cetera.  I think a good idea would be to divide each section into two parts, one which introduces the ''basic'' theory about the chapter, and another which explains some more hands-on material.  For example, when talking about capacitors, the theory section could give a quick rundown on how they work, and the equations that can be used to model them, whereas the hands-on section would have something like &quot;here is an interesting circuit which helps you to understand how they work.&quot;  Another problem which I see with the current incarnation of the book is that people tend to ignore the prerequisites.  For example, the term &quot;vector&quot; is explained a number of times in this book, and often not very clearly.  However, in the prerequisites, it says that the book assumes an understanding of algebra, calculus, and geometry.  This book should not explain what a vector is, it should simply assume the knowledge, and provide a link for people who don't know or need a refresher.  It would be much more efficient if there was one place where people focused their efforts on explaining mathematics, and another place for electronics.  Not only does mixing them clutter up the electronics book, but it also does not provide as good of an explanation as a math section would.  Not to argue against myself, but a short appendix with some basic mathematical formulae mae be handy, but I would argue to leave the serious teaching of mathematics to another place.  Furthermore, I think that if the book is well written, it could be understood by someone who doesn't understand or doesn't care about the calculus involved, while still satisfying the curiosities of the more mathematically inclined.  It is just a matter of being clear on which sections are absolutely necessary, and which are the more &quot;advanced&quot; topics.  Sorry for the rant, but I think this book needs a clear direction.  I like the idea of having more hands-on material quite a bit, but I would argue against ''removing'' the theory.

What are the goals of this book (hands on experiments, mathematical theory, circuit analysis . . .)?

What math does the book assume of its reader (highschool math, calc, linear algebra, diff eq)?

What other knowledge does the book assume (basic physics . . .)?

What should the structure of the book be, in what order are things presented, and how can theory and application be kept separate, but still be meaningful and useful on their own?

(wow, sorry for the huge rant, but I have been going through this book and reading, sometimes tweaking, for a while now, and I have been thinking about a lot of places where I beleive it falls short.  Hopefully I will have some more time to help out [[User:Jimac|jim]] 02:00 (UTC) 23 Aug 2005)

:I'm not going to read that entire thing right now, but now i've seen an electronics book, it starts with defining a battery in 2 sentences and putting some pictures of them up, then it does the same thing with resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.. and multimeter + power supply +signal generator (ocilloscope too but that would be too expensive for beginners) just a few sentances and pictures of parts for the first section of the first chapter. THIS wikibook gives the reader equations for electrostatic charge (no one needs that for learning electronics and wether it should be in the book is questionable.) You may want to delete the first few chapters to the entire book. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 23:24, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

Currently, there are many wikibook &quot;modules&quot; in the &quot;Electronic:&quot; namespace.
I agree with [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] that they are really outside the scope of an electronics book.
But instead of deleting them, is there some other book (or even Wikipedia article) that we could move them to?

== EE bookshelf ==

I've recently started work on a number of books at the [[Engineering bookshelf#Electrical Engineering|electrical engineering bookshelf]]. While many of these books will touch on the same topics as are covered in the Electronics book, i think that the EE books will have a much more limited scope, and a more well-defined target audience. In particular, These books so far are trying to be very &quot;mathematically light&quot;, in contrast to some of the pages in this book which can be very equation-dense. Also, I am trying to lay out an entire EE &quot;curriculum&quot; of sorts, in the form of a natural progression of wikibooks that would follow an undergraduate curriculum in EE. I am not really interested in having all the books merged, because a gigantic, hold-all, monolithic book really defeats the purpose of having &quot;bookshelves&quot; at all. Let me know what everybody here thinks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 22:31, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

:As an update to this, I've gone through a few of these and marked those that are obvious forks of other material, but there are several pages which I couldn't find already as part of the book, and these need to either be linked or merged with the rest of the book (or deleted if it's a fork I missed).

== Another posibility for the scope of this book. ==

In my opinion, Wikibooks needs separate books on the following:

*Basic Electronics (to GCSE/16 year old level), so Ohm's Law, etc.
*Advanced Electronics or Theoretical Electronics, which takes there reader from the end of Basic Electronics to an advanced level, detailing all the theory needed the understand it (or we have Electronics (quite detailed) and &quot;Advanced Electronics&quot; (very detailed), which I think would be clumsy). This would be quite equation heavy, but could have lighter &quot;in brief&quot; pages, perhaps.
*History of Electronics, from rubbing amber with a cloth to computers. This could also include how electronics products are made (might need a different name).
*Practical Electronics, which is '''how''' to make circuit work, which IC to use for what, how to solder and lay out a PCB, etc.
*Electronics Data, containing useful tables and the like applicabe to all the above. Perhaps also a dictionary of electronics and an index for all the above. Maybe &quot;Electronics&quot; could be like an electronics bookshelf, pointing the way to all the above books.

:Although it looks like [[Electric Circuits]] does this already

:[[User:Inductiveload|Inductiveload]] 09:22, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

This way, every reader has access to material that they can understand and use. Otherwise we risk losing usefulness for one end of the spectrum or the other.

Along with specialised books like Semiconductors, Electromagnetics, etc, this should give a broad AND in-depth electronics resource.

: That sounds great. I agree that there's no need to put everything electronic in one big book -- separate books on the above topics is a good idea.
: And [[Subject: Electrical engineering/Descriptions]] (formerly [[Electric Circuits]] ) looks like a nice overview of all the books we have so far on the subject.
: On the other hand, when I read through the roughly 30 books in [[Subject: Electrical engineering]] and the roughly 25 books in its sub-Subject [[Subject:Computer engineering]] (some books are in both lists), I suspect that many of those books should be merged together, since the topics and the audience heavily overlap. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 02:15, 8 September 2011 (UTC)

== Merging Electric Motors ==

I am against this merge, becasue motors have very little to do with Electronics - they are Electrical devcies. I know it is a small distinction, but it it like computers vs. hoovers. If motors have to be merged with anything (which I oppose, as motors is a very broad subject and can be expanded to a large size anyway - think of all the different types and what would happen if we made a REALLY thoughough examination of how they work from the most physical level) it should be Electromagnetics.

'''Motor Controller Circuits''' on the other hand belong either here or in [[Practical Electronics]].
[[User:Inductiveload|Inductiveload]] 09:14, 15 September 2006 (UTC) (forgot to log in the first time)

 Iam also against the idea of merging Electrical machines with Electronics..
 Let us have these topics under a hierarchial tree . As there are so
 many topics in electrical engg, let us have a detailed descibtion
 about these topics.       --Wascool


I am neither in favour of merging the two nor in support of merging the two but i would like to point out that all electronics engineers are required to have some basic idea of electric machines because they are the final objects which are controlled. It might seem a bit redundant to many whose primary objectives are vlsi or chip oriented.
But the point remained that wikibooks are supposed to help students and all electronic engineering students need to study electrical machines so it wouldnt be of much harm if the topic is merged those who dont want to read can skip it.

===No Merging===
Electronics is the study of flow of electrons in some material. Please don't merge it with Electrical Machines.

===Conclusion of knowledge===
What do we know ?
* Motors - and however any electromechanical device - can be driven and controlled by electronic circuits.
* Motors can be used to cool down electronic circuits.
* Motors can contain electronic circuits.
* Motors can be a part of electronic circuits.
* Motors do work trough electromagnetic fields. There are electrical fields and flows of electrons causing magnetic fields which are creating the * rotation effect and so on.
* Electronic parts can be influenced by electromagnetic fields. A motor in fact can be used to erase the contents of a electronic memory ...
* Electron flows through Motors are influenced and affected by the inductivity and other things like the rotation speed, the rotation strength and more.
* Electronic circuits can have influences to motors and vice versa.
So it looks like motors do have characteristics of electronic parts and should also be treated as.

'''In fact a electronic circuit is nothing else than e small electrical machine. It is something that has a physical effect by applying a electrical current through it.'''

As an electrical engineering graduate and electronics engineering postgraduate with a combined proffessional experience of almost 30 years, I am against this merger, and would suggest a separate line of books on electrical power engineering covering topics such as , electromagnetics, DC machines (generators and motors), AC machines (synchronous and asysnchronous), three phase circuits and machines, transformers, real / reactive power, electrical power generation/ transmission/ distribution, cables, lighting, circuit breakers and ohter switchgear, power electronics/rectifier/invertor/ VFVV drives and much more

I asked the people on commons about using screenshots from LTSpice, but they didn't have too much knowledge of the subject.

What are the rules here?  If I cannot submit a screen from LTSpice, what am I to do?  I could export the plot data, and use GNU plot, but that feels more like a workaround than the ethical solution.

**Wouldn't Linear be the right party to ask? They own LTSpice, and if they allow you to put screenshots from LTspice   showing your own circuits under the GNU Free Documentation License wouldn't that be ok? An alternative would be to use free software like gEDA's gscheme together with ngspice. However that isn't a very convenient solution.

Network programming under UNIX is relatively simple in C.

This guide assumes you already have a good general idea about C, UNIX and networks.


==A simple client==

To start with, we'll look at one of the simplest things you can do: initialize a stream connection and receive a message from a remote server.
&lt;source lang=c&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   char buffer[MAXRCVLEN + 1]; /* +1 so we can add null terminator */
   int len, mysocket;
   struct sockaddr_in dest; 
 
   mysocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  
   memset(&amp;dest, 0, sizeof(dest));                /* zero the struct */
   dest.sin_family = AF_INET;
   dest.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_LOOPBACK); /* set destination IP number - localhost, 127.0.0.1*/

   buffer[len] = '\0';
 
   printf(&quot;Received %s (%d bytes).\n&quot;, buffer, len);
 
   close(mysocket);
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the very bare bones of a client; in practice, we would check every function that we call for failure, however, error checking has been left out for clarity.

As you can see, the code mainly revolves around &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt; which is a struct of type &lt;code&gt;sockaddr_in&lt;/code&gt;. This struct stores information about the machine we want to connect to.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
mysocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt; function tells our OS that we want a file descriptor for a socket which we can use for a network stream connection; what the parameters mean is mostly irrelevant for now.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
memset(&amp;dest, 0, sizeof(dest));                /* zero the struct */
dest.sin_family = AF_INET;
dest.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;); /* set destination IP number */ 
dest.sin_port = htons(PORTNUM);                /* set destination port number */
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we get on to the interesting part:

The first line uses &lt;code&gt;memset()&lt;/code&gt; to zero the struct.

The second line sets the address family. This should be the same value that was passed as the first parameter to &lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt;; for most purposes &lt;code&gt;AF_INET&lt;/code&gt; will serve.

The third line is where we set the IP of the machine we need to connect to. The variable &lt;code&gt;dest.sin_addr.s_addr&lt;/code&gt; is just an integer stored in Big Endian format, but we don't have to know that as the &lt;code&gt;inet_addr()&lt;/code&gt; function will do the conversion from string into Big Endian integer for us.

The fourth line sets the destination port number. The &lt;code&gt;htons()&lt;/code&gt; function converts the port number into a Big Endian short integer. If your program is going to be run solely on machines which use Big Endian numbers as default then &lt;code&gt;dest.sin_port = 21&lt;/code&gt; would work just as well. However, for portability reasons &lt;code&gt;htons()&lt;/code&gt; should always be used.

Now that all of the preliminary work is done, we can actually make the connection and use it:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
connect(mysocket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;dest, sizeof(struct sockaddr));
&lt;/source&gt;

This tells our OS to use the socket &lt;code&gt;mysocket&lt;/code&gt; to create a connection to the machine specified in &lt;code&gt;dest&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
len = recv(mysocket, buffer, MAXRCVLEN, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

Now this receives up to &lt;code&gt;MAXRCVLEN&lt;/code&gt; bytes of data from the connection and stores them in the buffer string. The number of characters received is returned by &lt;code&gt;recv()&lt;/code&gt;. It is important to note that the data received will not automatically be null terminated when stored in the buffer, so we need to do it ourselves with &lt;code&gt;buffer[inputlen] = '\0'&lt;/code&gt;.

And that's about it!

The next step after learning how to receive data is learning how to send it. If you've understood the previous section then this is quite easy. All you have to do is use the &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; function, which uses the same parameters as &lt;code&gt;recv()&lt;/code&gt;. If in our previous example &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; had the text we wanted to send and its length was stored in &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; we would write &lt;code&gt;send(mysocket, buffer, len, 0)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of bytes that were sent. It is important to remember that &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt;, for various reasons, may not be able to send all of the bytes, so it is important to check that its return value is equal to the number of bytes you tried to send. In most cases this can be resolved by resending the unsent data.

==A simple server==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
 
#define PORTNUM 2300
 
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char* msg = &quot;Hello World !\n&quot;;
  
    struct sockaddr_in dest; /* socket info about the machine connecting to us */
    struct sockaddr_in serv; /* socket info about our server */
    int mysocket;            /* socket used to listen for incoming connections */
    socklen_t socksize = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);

    memset(&amp;serv, 0, sizeof(serv));           /* zero the struct before filling the fields */
    serv.sin_family = AF_INET;                /* set the type of connection to TCP/IP */
    serv.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY); /* set our address to any interface */
    serv.sin_port = htons(PORTNUM);           /* set the server port number */    

    mysocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  
    /* bind serv information to mysocket */
    bind(mysocket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;serv, sizeof(struct sockaddr));

    /* start listening, allowing a queue of up to 1 pending connection */
    listen(mysocket, 1);
    int consocket = accept(mysocket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;dest, &amp;socksize);
  
    while(consocket)
    {
        printf(&quot;Incoming connection from %s - sending welcome\n&quot;, inet_ntoa(dest.sin_addr));
        send(consocket, msg, strlen(msg), 0); 
        close(consocket);
        consocket = accept(mysocket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;dest, &amp;socksize);
    }

    close(mysocket);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Superficially, this is very similar to the client. The first important difference is that rather than creating a &lt;code&gt;sockaddr_in&lt;/code&gt; with information about the machine we're connecting to, we create it with information about the server, and then we &lt;code&gt;bind()&lt;/code&gt; it to the socket. This allows the machine to know the data received on the port specified in the &lt;code&gt;sockaddr_in&lt;/code&gt; should be handled by our specified socket.

The &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; function then tells our program to start listening using the given socket. The second parameter of &lt;code&gt;listen()&lt;/code&gt; allows us to specify the maximum number of connections that can be queued. Each time a connection is made to the server it is added to the queue. We take connections from the queue using the &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; function. If there is no connection waiting on the queue the program waits until a connection is received. The &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; function returns another socket. This socket is essentially a &quot;session&quot; socket, and can be used solely for communicating with connection we took off the queue. The original socket (&lt;code&gt;mysocket&lt;/code&gt;) continues to listen on the specified port for further connections.

Once we have &quot;session&quot; socket we can handle it in the same way as with the client, using &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;recv()&lt;/code&gt; to handle data transfers.

Note that this server can only accept one connection at a time; if you want to simultaneously handle multiple clients then you'll need to &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; off separate processes, or use threads, to handle the connections.

==Useful network functions==
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int gethostname(char *hostname, size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;

The parameters are a pointer to an array of chars and the size of that array. If possible, it finds the hostname and stores it in the array.  On failure it returns -1.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name);
&lt;/source&gt;

This function obtains information about a domain name and stores it in a &lt;code&gt;hostent&lt;/code&gt; struct. The most useful part of a &lt;code&gt;hostent&lt;/code&gt; structure is the &lt;code&gt;(char**) h_addr_list&lt;/code&gt; field, which is a null terminated array of the IP addresses associated with that domain. The field &lt;code&gt;h_addr&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer to the first IP address in the &lt;code&gt;h_addr_list&lt;/code&gt; array. Returns &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; on failure.

==FAQs==

===What about stateless connections?===

If you don't want to exploit the properties of TCP in your program and would rather just use a UDP connection, then you can just replace &lt;code&gt;SOCK_STREAM&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;SOCK_DGRAM&lt;/code&gt; in your call to &lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt; and use the result in the same way. It is important to remember that UDP does not guarantee delivery of packets and order of delivery, so checking is important.

If you want to exploit the properties of UDP, then you can use &lt;code&gt;sendto()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;recvfrom()&lt;/code&gt;, which operate like &lt;code&gt;send()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;recv()&lt;/code&gt; except you need to provide extra parameters specifying who you are communicating with.

===How do I check for errors?===

The functions &lt;code&gt;socket()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;recv()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; all return -1 on failure and use errno for further details.

==[[Main Page/test]]==
Don't give up on that page. It has great potential. I think the biggest problem is the increasing number of wikibooks on the main page. Maybe what should be done is like Wikipedia, the tables version just lists:

{{bookshelves}}

Whereas the No Tables version will list the books as is on the current main page.

== Wikibooks is not ==

[[Wikibooks:What Wikibooks is not|Wikibooks is not]] #4: ''A place for fiction texts. Wikibooks primary mission is to create open source textbooks, how-to guides, and classroom aids.'' [[Ardvark the Aardvark]] should not have been transwikied here. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:19, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Wikimania and the situation on Wikibooks ==

I'm going to point to a lengthier reply I made to [[m:User:Eloquence|Eloquence]] that [[m:User talk:Eloquence#Wikimania on Wikibooks|be found on his talk page]].  I have added a footnote on the project cleanup page for Wikibooks that this is something to do.

Honestly, this is an unusual request (to recreate all of the links from previous Wikimania content), as this is the first instance I have seen that transwikied content that was misplaced on Wikibooks and removed is being demanded, with threats of being blocked and being desysoped if it is not accomplished.  What is more, I'm being asked to recreate not just one or two links, but hundreds of links all over Wikibooks.  And besides, with all of the spilled ink over this mess, you and all of the people who are pounding on me could have added those links themselves as well with much less effort.  I am just warning everybody who is going to do this on Wikibooks that unless you offer a very good reason why the redirect links need to stay, it is likely to be considered mild vandalism and be removed by admins other than myself... even inadvertantly.  Orphaned redirects, and redirects that point to projects other than Wikibooks are likely to be deleted through general Wikibooks cleanup.

If there is an issue that needs to be brought up about this, solicit help from the general Wikibooks community at [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]].  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:43, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

== Deletion of Whole Earth Catalog ==

We have a very active administrator who has been doing quite a bit of cleanup work here at Wikibooks.  I think he is a little overeager to remove content, but unfortunately there is a lot of deadwood that needs to be removed that it is nice to have somebody doing the heavy lifting even if he makes an occasional mistake.  I think this is one of them (a mistake), and it should have remained on the VfD page for some additional time.

I've moved the content to [[User:Sj/Whole Earth Catalog]] for now to let you copy over the content or do whatever else you wanted to do with it.  If there were some sub-pages that you were aware of, I would be willing to undelete them as well.  I can't find any in the logs at the moment.  I apologize if there was any hard feelings about this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

There was a little error in your userpage on the [[:simple:|Simple Wíkibooks]] regarding the link to your page here. When I pressed the link I ended on the Wikibooks page [[:wb:User:Sj]] and that one doesn't exist. 

I fixed it with [http://simple.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASj&amp;diff=13275&amp;oldid=11405 this] edit. I hope you don't mind that I editted your userpage.

== [[How Wikipedia Works]] ==

If you're wanting to bring in the content from http://howwikipediaworks.com I must point out that new content has to at least be licensed under the [[Wikibooks:Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License|Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0]] if not dual-licensed with the GFDL in order to comply with the new licensing terms on Wikibooks.  Maybe you're writing it in your own words; that'd be fine.  I encountered this same issue when I wanted to bring in the [http://www.fhsst.org Free High School Science Texts]. I tried to contact the creators to find out if they'd dual-license but got no response.  As a result, I can't bring in the content.  So if you want to pull straight from that site you'd want to contact the authors like I tried to in my own situation. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:35, 29 July 2009 (UTC)
: Thanks Adrignola.  I was a technical editor for the book, and am in touch with the authors; we discussed finally starting to import it over the past weekend at Wikiconference NYC where [[w:user:Phoebe|user:Phoebe]] (the lead authr) and [[user:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] were both in the room together at the same time.  But until all the authors get together and agree on a cc-sa license, I'm just going to include the TOC and some supplementary details that I can reword myself.

== Greetings ==

I noticed the edits you made to your user page.  Any thoughts on the current main page?  Regardless of the aesthetics, we've got some new code underneath that helps provide more randomness in the books promoted and the new code is easier to understand for newer administrators when they need to add a new featured book to the rotation.

You noticed CK-12's license change too, eh?  Fortunately I had downloaded PDFs marked with the original license and hosted them at Commons.  It's slow going but I transcribed [[High School Earth Science]] and am now working on [[High School Trigonometry]].  Working on the latter book has actually helped me become even more proficient as a wiki editor.  I wanted to have the diagrams look nice such that they weren't just copy-pastes from the PDF with poor scaling.  To that end I downloaded the Compass-and-Ruler and Inkscape programs to produce SVG diagrams.  Just from the work on that book alone I've become quite a bit more proficient at working with Inkscape and I'm pretty thrilled with the quality of the book in its wiki form.  Given that it's a mathematics book, I also had to learn how to make [[Help:Formulas|formulas]] on MediaWiki with TeX, so I've practically learned a new language.  The books that have PDFs available at Commons to prove their licensing can be seen at [[Subject:CK-12 books]].  They're also filed in their respective subject matter categories as well.  Just thought I'd touch base. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:23, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since I first posted on here, I've changed my mind completely about the layout of the book. I think now that a more conventional layout is desirable. Below is an outline of what I'm thinking about right now.

The general notion is that, aside from the usual TOC, index, etc., the book will have two large sections. The first is the traditional textbook part, providing the info one would find in any human sexuality text, while the second zooms in to focus on topics that are particularly hot right now outside the academy. Homo- and bisexuality, for example, are all over the news, what with the Federal Marriage Amendment and related stuff. I'm also looking at info on sex education, rape, and pornography, all of which are politically charged and directly relevant to the lives of your average undergrad. Take a look at the outline and let me know what you think.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When I first wrote this module, [[Algebra/Function Graphing|Function graphing]],  I had just two fundamental general linear equation forms, Ax + By = C and the slope-intercept form y = m x + b.  That, along with the formula for slope of a line, seemed sufficient to me to solve all linear equation problems.  Later, I looked in several algebra books which also had the point-slope form and the intercept form of a line.  &lt;br&gt;I added these two extra forms to the [[Algebra/Function Graphing|Function graphing]] module for completeness and to meet educational standards, since all the algebra books I looked at had them.  After further comparison and contemplation about the two additional line forms, it seems to me they are redundant and not really necessary, but I left them in there to meet any educational textbook standards that might call for them.  Is anyone familiar with the educational standards on these items?  I now think that these two extra line forms are a redundant and unnecessary complications which could boggle the student's mind (Ya think?!!! This is the chapter that has ultimately forced me to give up on algerbra!) more than they might help a math student accomplish anything useful.  Maybe educational standards should be changed to delete the point-slope and intercept forms of a line in modern algebra courses to reduce the number of equations that have to be learned.

==I'm finished with the theory in this module.[[Image:75%.png]]==

This module has become quite long and I'm pretty much finished covering the graphing theory of linear functions.  I've decided to end work on the theory in this module and continue in subsequent modules.  I'm basically finished with this module except for problems or exercises.[[Image:75%.png]]  Graphing multiple systems of equations with multiple unknowns will continue in the next module, which I've just started.  In the following three modules after that, math equation theory on quadratics and inequality theory have been written up in modules that are not really long, but the graphing of quadratics and inequalities has not yet been covered.  Time and energy permitting, I may add some graphics on quadratics and inequalities to these modules.  After that, I've just started another module, [[Algebra/Additional function and relation graphing]], which will provide further examples of graphs, discuss other aspects of graphing, and cover circles and ellipses.  In still further parts of the Algebra book, polynomials, exponential functions, and logarithms will be covered and graphs on those subjects can then be added to those modules.  

Of course, if someone wants to work on this stuff, go ahead.  I would like to know your plans so there's not a duplication of effort.  You can use my graphs as &quot;templates&quot; to make your own or you can tell me what you want and I will try to make the graphs for you, my time and energy permitting.  I have gained a bit of experience making these graphs now.  &lt;br&gt;[[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 18:35, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Slope vs. gradient ==

I'm assuming slope is the American term for the gradient of a straight line (the m in &lt;math&gt;y=mx+c&lt;/math&gt;). I'm a Brit, and we refer to it as the gradient. Which is more widely used in mathematical circles, and would it make more sense to use gradient as it will be referred to once a student reaches a level where differentiation is becoming involved? I'm happy to be shot down, I just thought I'd bring this up. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 15:20, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
:Also, on a related note, I've always referred to the y-intercept constant as c, as opposed to b... [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 15:25, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

*Purpose: &quot;to provide access to citations from biomedical literature.&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/overview.html#Introduction:Source]
*Audience: PubMed is run by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) which is part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in the United States. NCBI was established in 1988 as a national resource for molecular biology information, NCBI creates public databases, conducts research in computational biology, develops software tools for analyzing genome data, and disseminates biomedical information - all for the better understanding of molecular processes affecting human health and disease. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/:Source]
*Scope: Biomedical literature. Pubmed &quot;allows users to access a superset of NLM's MEDLINE database containing MEDLINE, in-process citations, and citations to articles from selectively indexed journals that normally would not be selected for MEDLINE indexing.&quot; [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/pubmed.html:Source]

====Search Fields====
&quot;PubMed uses an Automatic Term Mapping feature to search for unqualified terms. When you click Go, PubMed will look for a match in up to four lists. It looks first for a match in the MeSH Translation Table. If it doesn't find a match, it looks in the Journals Translation Table and finally in the Author Index. As soon as PubMed finds a match, the mapping stops. That is, if a term matches in the MeSH Translation Table, PubMed does not continue looking in the next table.&quot; [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_tutorial/m2006.html] When there are no matches found during the automatic term mapping process, individual words are searched in all fields.

===Who I Am and What I Do===
My name is Macneil Shonle. My area is software engineering, so I like to take a software engineering kind of approach to the texts that I work on:

* ''[[Computer Science:Data Structures|Data Structures]] {fundamental tools}''
* ''[[Computer Science:Algorithms|Algorithms]] {fundamental techniques}''
* ''[[Computer Science:Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms|Data Structures and Algorithms]] {advanced tools and techniques}''
* ''[[Computer Science:Programming Languages|Programming Languages]]''
* ''[[Computer Science:Logic|Logic for Computer Scientists]]''

I'm primarily interested in the ''Algorithms'' book, which I work on whenever I find myself having the time. I want the book to primarily focus on the techniques used for designing your own algorithms (or understanding someone else's), rather than just having yet-another-reference book. The goal is to help people see the forest for the trees. While Knuth and CLRS are great books to have, I learned algorithms from a professor who had a great vision of teaching them. My main goal for the ''Algorithms'' book is to communicate that vision.

Many data structures books focus on seemingly trivial details and miss telling the greater story of abstraction. The book ''[[w:Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|SICP]]'', on the other hand, tells the story of abstraction quite well. Thus, my goal for the ''Data Structures'' book is to tell the same abstraction story in the context of all the most fundamental data structures.

Lately, the OO idea has only been half-understood by authors of popular data structures books. For example, I've seen several sources confuse the concept of encapsulation with abstraction. Much of the complexity of modern OO languages is actually quite arbitrary, so focusing on that only means you are telling an artificially complex story.

I created the ''Advanced'' book primarily as a place to keep off-topic but interesting material. While some cutting edge algorithms or data structures are very cool, they are inappropriate for introductory texts. (Why confuse the reader who is not yet comfortable with even the basic concepts yet?)

(I'm also an admin and active member of wikibooks, so you may find that many of my user contributions are simply deleting spam or voting in strange discussions of odd books.)

I'm also a Wikipedian, so you should check out [[w:User:Mshonle|my wikipedia page]] too.

===Where've I been?===
I've been sucked into a graduate student vortex for a while. Research first, as that's what pays the bills! [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:32, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

===Did I Delete a Wikipedia Link?===
Perhaps you've come to my page because I deleted a wikipedia link inserted into one of the books I work on? Sorry about that... didn't mean to bite anyone's head or anything. In the future I'll try leaving the wikipedia links up longer. However, it is my intention that the books we work on won't need wikipedia links in the main body of the text. Here's how I see it:
#If a book entry mentions something well known, such as the internet, or prime numbers, there's no need to link. A really confused reader could still google or search on wikipedia themselves.
#If a book mentions (e.g.) prime numbers in a way that is important, it should recap in-place the relevant properties instead. In fact, you can use the wikipedia as a resource to help you write that recap. Instead of flooding a person with all of the information the wikipedia entry gives, it's your job to just give them what they need to know. (Perhaps a definition, or a notation, for example.)
#If you really think the information linked will help the person, because it's a very interesting tangent, put the link instead at the end of the chapter, in a Related Readings section. (But again, if it's not a tangent, but important, it should be in the body of the text!)
#Some people think '''information, information, information''' is always good and &quot;so long as it's true, it's useful&quot;. I instead take the view that our time on this planet is limited, and thus it's more valuable if we do what we can to provide signals to highlight the most important information. Without these signals (i.e., we let all information through, and include a link to every word used that has a wikipedia entry) learning will be hurt.
#On the other hand, for the Wikipedia itself, the rich and deep links ''are'' the information. Less-so with a book, where the writing and transfering of ''specific'' knowledge is what's needed, not the categorization and linking of ''general'' knowledge.
But given all of that, this project is a part-part-time job for me. Some sections will be stubs for a year if someone else doesn't get to them first. The books will be sparse in areas until the First Edition is achieved, and it sure will look like they need the links. But instead of linking, get to writing! Your writing or spelling doesn't even have to be good: we'll help you, just as others have helped me.

See you in the page logs!

===Scrap Pages===
* [[/Policy]]
* [[/Around 2000 Words]] -- A personal statement
* [[/Charters]] an idea of mine for helping the VFD process and respecting expert contributors -- but without major bureaucracy
* [[/First edition]] another policy idea that would encourage books to reach a &quot;shippable&quot; stage, and help reorganize the main page to lead more people to completed works
* [[/Scrap]] some material that might be rewritten and put into a very introductory economics book
* [[/SEAdvancedModularity]]

===To Do===
* Unify the &quot;computing&quot; bookshelves so that there is only three names:
*# Computer Science -- the more &quot;math-like&quot; stuff you would get in college
*# Programming -- language guides, library tutorials, programming tips and recipies
*# IT -- about computer programs, using them, set up of networks, so long as you aren't writing much &quot;code&quot;
* Re-order the programming language shelve so that there is no &quot;misc&quot;, &quot;hybrid&quot; or &quot;imperative&quot; sections (all are far too general topics to be helpful).
* Finish policy write ups.
* Design/write up all data-structure ADTs for the book</text>

== standard terminology ==

I am not pleased with the word &quot;searches&quot; and the way I use it to refer to all search engines, search mechanisms, search software... &quot;Searches&quot; is ambiguous. &quot;Search engine&quot; doesn't seem to fit things like [[How To Search/PubMed|PubMed]] or [[How To Search/grep|grep]]. Suggestions? [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 22:02, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Perhapse the word &quot;queries&quot; would suffice ([[User:Freesodas|Freesodas]] ([[User talk:Freesodas|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Freesodas|contribs]]) 22:44, 2 August 2013 (UTC)).

== Searching: query vs browsing ==

I just realized that my original intent with this book was to concentrate on query based searching and ignore browsing based searching. If anyone feels so inclined and ambitious enough to integrate content related to searching by browsing, please go ahead. Query based searches, as I am thinking of them, present a space in which a user must type text (or other info) before they can get results. Browsing as a search method involves discoverability. The two methods usually complement one another. Examples:
*Yahoo Directory requires a browsing search method.
*Yahoo Search requires a query search method.

== Removal of Search by Operator Syntax ==

I have removed the following because it doesn't seem useful at the moment.  I can imagine it being useful but Wikibook categories may be a better option if this is ever revived.
----
*'''AND'''  - | [[How To Search/AND-default|{default}]] | [[How To Search/AND-AND|AND]] | [[How To Search/AND-plus|+]]
*'''OR'''  - | [[How To Search/OR-default|{default}]] | [[How To Search/OR-OR|OR]]
*'''NOT'''  - | [[How To Search/NOT-default|{default}]] | [[How To Search/NOT-NOT|NOT]] | [[How To Search/NOT-negative|-]]

== Orphaned Wikibook module ==

The following is an orphaned Wikibook module that is associated with this wikibook:

*[[How To Search/Other search type list]]

Feel free to edit this module and place the template tag &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|Cleaning up Wikibook}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; if it doesn't belong here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:08, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:[[How To Search/Feedster]] is another orphan. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 04:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

== suggestion on usability: user's goals ==

How about putting titles on the home page like what a user would be asking himself?  If a person really doesn't know how to search, he may not know what Google is!

- Finding phone numbers
- Finding maps and directions
- Finding software for my computer I can download for free
- Finding general information in an online encyclopedia
- When to use Google (as compared to a more specific search, like a phone number)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do I replace the piston and cylinder? ==

Take off side fairings.   Remove airbox with one large philips screw and detach from carburetor by unscrewing clamp. 

Turn on fuel flow and remove carburetor where it attaches to intake with philips screw. Let carburetor hang to the side. Unbolt oil injection from intake manifold with one small (size?) bolt.

Unbolt exhaust at bottom of engine and consider completely removing exhaust from moped.

On cylinder head, remove spark plug wire and pull spark plug. Unbolt head from cylinder via 11mm bolts and washer. Wiggle cylinder head completely off engine, pulling it past piston and rings. Stuff paper or cloth in remaining hole to keep debris out of engine.

Unbolt intake manifold from cylinder and remove reed valve. Replace intake and reed valve on new cylinder along with appropriate gaskets.

Remove piston by unclipping 2 retainer rings on wrist pin. Slide out wrist pin, tapping if necessary. Remove piston.

Put new rings on new piston by gently working them down over top of piston. Check documentation for ring arrangement. Often, pistons will have a finger in the groove to keep ring alignment at preferred angles. 

Slide piston into new cylinder by compressing rings one at a time. 
The piston is only supposed to go in one way. It should have an arrow on the top which is supposed to point at the exhaust port (away from the carb).


Scrape old gasket from engine where cylinder mounts and install new gasket. Put new cylinder partially on engine while aligning connecting rod with piston. Slide and clip new wrist pin in with needle nose pliers. Slide cylinder completely down onto engine.

Pour a small amount of 2-stroke oil down cylinder to piston. Roll the engine with kickstart or pedals to lube walls of piston and cylinder. 

Replace head. Slide washers and nuts on bolts with allen wrench or similar tool. Torque down in X pattern. Be careful not to overtorque. Replace spark plug and wire.

Bolt on exhaust, using appropriate gasket. Replace carburetor and air box. Turn on gas. 

Remember to vary speed while break-in and limit full-throttle operation for 300 miles.

Some people recommend mixing a little extra 2-cycle oil into the gas for the brake-in period.

After the break-in period check head bolts and tighten if necessary.

== How do I do a plug chop? ==
Full warm up the engine by running it for about 10 minutes... Then make a top speed full throttle run for a half mile or more, then kill the motor and stop and pull the spark plug on the spot.

It is important to chop the throttle and turn the engine off with the switch and pull over to stop. You don't want the engine to come to an idle, That will change the plug color.

== How do I replace my chain? ==

Loosen the tension adjustment tabs at the rear tire by loosening the nut on one side. Tap these until the cams are in the loosest position. Remove the chain guard with two Philips screws.

Find the master link by slowing rotating the rear tire. It will look different than the rest of the links in the chain. Pop it over using a screwdriver and a sharp pop of the wrist.

To avoid needing to pull the left pedal and part of the engine cover, reattach the new chain with the masterlink to the old chain. Keep tension on the chain and slowly rotate the rear tire to pull the new chain forward through the front sprocket. 

When the old chain has pulled through, pull the two other parts of the old master link off. Use a new master link to connect the chain. 

If you are using different sized sprockets or a universal chain that is longer than stock, you may need to remove extra links. Use a link breaking tool or grind off pins and remove unneeded link sections.

Tighten tension adjustment tabs, making sure to keep them even on each side. Tap with a hammer if necessary. Look for a 10mm deflection in the chain when finished. 

Replace chain guard. Use chain lubrication to heavy oil down chain while slowly rotating rear wheel. Considering oiling chain every gas fill-up to lengthen chain life.

== How can I tell if my oil pump is working? ==
This is an easy one. On the carb manifold there is a hose on a brass fitting. Take the hose off.
Then remove the spark plug cap. Crank over a few times. If oil spits out then it works!
(look at the line if it is clear it is not working unlless you have just filled the oil tank!)

== How do I add an aftermarket exhaust? ==

Below the engine are two bolts and washers. Remove these. Another bolts connects the exhaust behind the pedals. Remove this and discard the exhaust. Replace the after-market exhaust, remembering to add an appropriate gasket before tighting bolts and washers. Don't overtorque! '''*Don't forget to upjet!*'''

== How do I change my rear sprocket? Front sprocket? ==

Little advice about this. A (27 Tooth) Count will allow for maximum speed to be reached without going crazy with compression issues, jetting, or even boring your ports larger. This is not necessary. A smaller sprocket will allow for a slower top end. your looking at a very cheap alternative, around maybe 15 to 20 bucks US. However if you're not looking to go fast then i would say use a 25 tooth sprocket for the front. Now if you want to go even faster, get a 20 tooth sprocket for the rear. The reason for this is very simple, in the front we have a larger sprocket to create more pull and a smaller one on the back means it completes it rotation faster therefore occupying less space in the back and more in the front will increase the speed of the chains movement. Absolutely the same thing as a bike sprocket the only change here is we are modifying it to be a bit different either faster or slower with more power. The larger sprocket in the rear will give you a much more powerful pull but less speed. A lot less, not a very good idea for road use here. To be safe use the smaller sprocket in the rear and larger in the front.

==How do I plug my oil pump so I can manually add 2-stroke oil?==

Remove tank from under seat after you drain off all oil. Disconnect oil lines at tank and under cover where oil pump is. Remove 2 screws from oil pump and put pump aside. Take off coupling insert and put with pump. Now on the intake manifold there is the banjo bolt. remove it with the line from the pump. Get another 5mm bolt and cut off short so it will not stick into the flow of fuel delivery. Insert screw with a fibre washer and tighten so there is no air leaks. Put the old side cover(round) for the pump back on. Double a piece of fuel line to fill in the holes where the oil lines fed in and out. Now mix fuel at 50:1 ratio (as recommended in all Tomos manuals) and you're finished.

If your moped is stock the oil injection may connect directly to the carburetor. If this is the case, you need to plug the hole the oil hose went into originally. The banjo bolt step in the above instructions could also be ignored.

==How do I change my carburetor's jet?==

Turn off fuel flow and remove carburetor where it attaches to intake with philips screw.

Invert carburetor and unscrew float bowl. The jet sits in the middle of the float. Be careful not to tear gasket. Unscrew jet and replace jet.

Reverse steps to reinstall.

== How do I change my Oil Injection? ==

To remove oil injection you will have to plug up the hole in the intake. Then remove the pump found on the left side of the motor under its little cover and block off the hole with sheet metal bolted on.

== How do I fix a flat tire? ==

Get a couple of hard plastic tire irons at your local bicycle shop.
These avoid damage to the rims (especially the chrome ones).  Use ONLY
proper (motorcycle) tubes.
a good idea is to change the inner tube.
Or you can also use fix a flat at a local motorsports store

==The spark plug has no spark==
There are many things to check coil, points,wiring.But the major cause of no spark in older tomos mopeds is the tail light bulb.the manufacturer does not want you driving with no taillight. If the filament is burned out or the bulb is missing the primary coil inside the flywheel will not fire the points thus no spark.

      <text xml:space="preserve">U-locks designed for bicycles are popular for locking the rear tire. Kryptonite locks are popular to locking your moped to an immovable object, such as a rail or tree.

Kill switches can be installed, making it difficult to start. Always use your gas cut-off switch.

Remember to register your vehicle and at the minimum get its VIN.

      <comment>moved [[Help:Subdomains]] to [[Wikibooks:Subdomains]] over redirect: historical *project* page</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{historical}}
Details on how to use the multiple subdomains presently activated for Wikibooks.
(From discussions moved from the [[Wikibooks:Staff Lounge|Staff Lounge]]).

== Subdomains introduced ==
In case you hadn't noticed, Wikibooks now has subdomains. I set up redirects from http://wikibooks.org/ and http://www.wikibooks.org/ to [[Wikibooks portal]], and then changed the main page of this wiki (which is now officially the English wiki) to be [[Main page]]. So if someone types en.wikibooks.org, it will take them to the English site, but if someone types wikibooks.org, it will take them to the old portal. All other URLs under the wikibooks.org domain are redirected to the corresponding page in en.wikibooks.org, so hopefully no links to us from outside will be broken. 

== Linking to other Wikimedia projects ==
To link to other projects from wikibooks, you can use the following prefixes, which link to the same language of a different project:

* w: wikipedia
* wikt: wiktionary
* q: wikiquote
* b: wikibooks
* m: meta-wiki

Note that any links you created to Wikipedias using syntax such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[fr:Accueil]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; will be broken -- they are now interlanguage links which will be extracted from the text and displayed in the sidebar. To link to a wikipedia of a different language, use [[w:fr:Accueil]]. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 14:13, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Questions ==
(see also the [[Wikibooks Talk:Subdomains|Talk page]].)

*So now we have to change '''all''' of the links that used to say 'en:' to 'w:en:', ''manually''. Is there a way you could do this with a bot or something? Could we change all of them at once? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 15:24, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::It might be best to contact someone who operates a bot. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 01:44, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)

*How do you create a new subdomain? Not that I want to, just that everything is en: right now, even the large German Wikibooks. Could you publicize this? 

::Go to the subdomain, there are instructions. 

:::I went to the subdomain ( http://de.wikibooks.org ) and got an &quot;does not exist&quot; error. The I went to http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hauptseite and there was the new domain. Now ( http://de.wikibooks.org ) works too and is redirected to die Hauptseite. But I still found no instructions. Did I anything wrong? I reregistered my nick, which worked. Do I guess right, and we have to migrate the pages manually?--[[User:Berni|berni]] 08:54, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)

=== Portal ===

* And could you also put the portal back at www.wikibooks.org? Thanks for all your work, Tim. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 00:58, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:: As for putting the portal back: well, I considered attempting to serve the page from the English but with a wikibooks.org domain name, just using a rewrite rule, but making rewrite rules cross into different virtual hosts is tricky. Putting in a redirect to en was definitely the easiest solution. The other solutions would be:

::#Write a PHP script to serve the page from the en.wikibooks wiki when requests come in for wikibooks.org or www.wikibooks.org
::#Create a static HTML page based on the current portal and put it in the appropriate location. Easy to set up but hard to maintain.

The portal should be at http://wikibooks.org or http://www.wikibooks.org with a redirection from one to the other. Many people think that a web site '''has to''' start with '''www'''. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 12:16, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

=== Moving pages across subdomains, and Transwiki ===
* I just wondered if there is the posibility to move a page completely to an other subdomain (including history and discussion). This would be a nice feature. I also do not know if there are legal problems, if we just copy the content.--[[User:Berni|berni]] 09:08, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:The [[m:transwiki]] system was designed to move content from one project or language to another while maintaining some record of the authors.  I don't think the ability to move pages into a different domain works yet, so that's probibly the best method to use.  Also note that the [[wikibooks:transwiki log|transwiki log]] is only for pages that spend some time in the transwiki namespace at the target wiki, therefore if a page is going from the main namespace at en directly to the main namespace at de, it doesn't need to be registered in the log. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 15:59, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::Ok. As far, as I understood, I have to copy &amp; paste the main article, and maybe the discussion-page. Then I've to go over the history to find all authors, who contributed to that page und write them on the discussion page (or if they are very few, I put them in the summary, when creating the new page. The I'll list the original page at the votes for deletion. Am I right with this process or did I overlook something important? --[[User:Berni|berni]] 08:13, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)
:::I think you've got the main points.  Eventually, we're supposed to be able to move pages from one wiki to another, but that's not ready yet. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 12:40, 22 Jul 2004 (UTC)
::For people who are familar with Java I've written a short Javaprogramm, that reads a page at en.wikibooks.org and gives a sorted list of the authors, that contributed to that page (it only works, if there arent more then 10000 changes to that page).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Multiple subdomains?==

I understand the question of having multiple subdomains for multiple wikibooks languages is somewhat contentious. I just wanted to say that I've now set up the technical means for easily and efficiently converting to a multi-subdomain project. I've just done this with wikiquote, I could easily do it for wikibooks too. The basic idea is to allow users to create wikis which don't yet exist by simply clicking on a button. 

Converting to a multi-subdomain site makes it possible to use an interface language which matches the content language. It also makes it easy to create interlanguage links, just like on Wikipedia. I think it's great how you've set up a language-neutral portal, and that portal can be kept after the conversion.

Anyway, I often get requests for setting up wikibooks subdomains, and personally I'm entirely in favour of it. But my opinion on this is irrelevant, what I really want to know is, what do the wikibookians think? -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 06:10, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Yes, thanks Tim. By language subdomains is long overdue. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 11:32, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)

It seems the only person strongly opposed to this is [[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]], who judging by his contributions, is not an active contributor here. I just discovered that in fact it's not trivial to set up subdomains for wikibooks, because the wikibooks.org subdomains are not configured to point to the Wikimedia servers, they just give an error. The wikibooks.org domain name is not owned or controlled by Wikimedia, in fact it is owned by none other than Maveric149. Now I'm sure this won't be a problem, since he did say back in July 2003: 

:''All these domain names will be donated to Wikimedia as soon as it is able to accept a legal transfer of ownership. It will be up to the Foundation to decide what to do with all these domain names and whether or not it makes sense to renew them (if so then I'll probably help to finance that too but I'm sure I won't be the only one).'' [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2003-July/010966.html]

Wikimedia is now able to accept such donations. If necessary, we can set up the other language wikis in subdirectories rather than subdomains, or we can move the whole project to a wikimedia-controlled domain. Perhaps that would be useful as an interim measure, while we wait for the transfer to be completed. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 12:04, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:I don't even have the current password to the GoDaddy.com account that holds those domains. Jason must have requested a new password since the one I had before is nearly impossible to remember. As for sub-domains - if I'm out voted, then I'm out outed. But I would still like people to look at the larger picture here;
*Books can be given descriptive names to avoid naming conflicts.
**Thus there is no need for a separate wiki.
*Somebody a while ago at least tried to submit a patch whereby people could set the interface language to whatever they wanted. I have not heard about the status of that patch. 
Could you enlighten us Tim? Such an ability is ''really'' necessary for Wikisource, Meta and the Foundation wiki. I also think that such a patch would make it possible for Wikibooks to stay together. Meta flags could later be added to set the interface language for anons (each page/module would have a language flag that would change the interface language for anons visiting that page). Also, the ability to set-up a new language project without having to ask a developer is a nice and wiki way of doing things. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 20:40, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:::If I recall correctly, the patch to allow people to select the user interface language had some serious conceptual problems. We have a $wgLang variable which indicates the current language, so changing it to something else is pretty trivial. But if $wgLang is not the same as the content language, it will be horribly broken. For example, the correct language is needed to send links with a language-specific namespace to the right location, or to link to the correct URLs in the sidebar. The problem requires a much more complex solution than simply changing $wgLang. -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 15:40, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)

::I think there are some good reasons to have multiple subdomains.
:*The naming conflict appears not only at modules, but also at pages like [[Wikibooks:Portal]].
:*There might also be naming conflicts at the Textbausteine (what's that in english? templates?)
:*It's easier for me to argue in german, than in english at pages like &quot;votes for deletion&quot; or here.
:*The search-function might deliver a lot of mess, that one isn't looking for. Example: When I'm looking for the word &quot;gift&quot; I will get english pages about presents, as well as german pages about poisons.
:*The DB-dump is probably smaller, at least it's easier to process only that part, that I'm interested in.
:*A few days before the idea of subdomains came up, I thought about creating a kathegory &quot;german&quot; to mark every page, that is german. I think subdomains are the better alternative.
:*I think we don't share much material between the languages (maybe Images and Sounds; and of course the spirit.)
:*Last but not least. The idea of subdomains will come up sooner or later again. And it will be much more work the longer we wait.
:I know, that we can find way around some (if not all) of this issues, but I think subdomains are an easier solution.--[[User:Berni|berni]] 11:45, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ancient Rome and the Republic==
===The Foundations of an Empire===

According to literature, Rome was founded in 753 BC by the twins named Romulus and Remus. They built their settlements on the Palatine and  Aventine hills respectively. (Rome sits on seven hills.)  Remus grew jealous of Romulus and mocked the size of the walls he had built, so Romulus killed him.  He then named the city after himself and was crowned king.  Whether or not this story is true, it highlights the warlike origins of Rome.  Around 753 BC the foundations of one of the most powerful empires in history were laid - one which would shake the very foundations of the world.

The Romans' own accounts and historical evidence suggests that, for several hundred years after its founding, Rome was ruled by kings and emperors. from the nearby land of Etruria.  The Etruscans were very oppressive rulers and the Romans desired to rid themselves of their masters.  In 509 BC, the son of the last king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, raped a noblewoman named Lucretia, and then Lucretia, out of her own humiliation, killed herself.  Outraged, her family instigated a revolt that drove the royal house of the Tarquins out of Rome.  Lucretia's husband, Lucius Tarquinius Collantis and one Lucius Junius Brutus became the first two consuls of a new republic which they founded.  The office of the consul became the chief executive position in the Republic.  The title of &quot;king&quot; became so despised that it remained a career-shattering charge until the rise of Julius Caesar and the end of the Republic.

===Social Structure and Citizenship===

The social structure of the Republic was basically divided between two main groups: the patricians, or the wealthy noble class, and the plebeians, the broad mass of peasant citizens.  One's class was hereditary, meaning that even if one was lucky enough to be one of the few plebeians who became wealthy and rich(or at least attained enough wealth to be considered middle class), especially as a merchant, one was still considered a plebian.  Likewise, some patricians had become almost poor towards the latter end of the Republic.  The plebeians were often at odds with the patricians and the class conflict that was generated often saw the patrician nobles granting certain privileges, rights, and concessions to the plebeians in order to keep them under control.  In 494 BC, the plebeians gained the right to elect two Tribunes, who held large amounts of control in the government of the Republic.  Later, this number was expanded to ten.  Finally, the plebeians were eventually allowed to elect a ''Concilium Plebis'', or &quot;Council of the Plebians&quot; which gave them greater control in legal affairs.  Towards the end of the Republic, a new group known as the ''equites'' became a powerful and potent force within the Republic, as the result of the actions of the Consul Tiberius Gracchus (more on him later).  Note that only men, no matter what class, were able to have authority or hold a political position in Rome.

===The Government of the Republic===

The chief body of the Republic was the Senate.  Contrary to popular belief, it held no law-making power, and consisted of an advisory function to the various assemblies, which actually passed the laws.  However, the Senate was the most important body in the Republic and the most influential - political careers were made or broken in the Roman Senate.  The Senate appointed governors and generals, directed the use of public funds, and received ambassadors on behalf of the city!  The Senate also had the important power of empowering the two Consuls to appoint a Dictator (for a period of six months) in times of emergency.   The reason was that the people of the Republic realized that in an emergency, especially that of war, democracies are too slow to act effectively (contrast this to heightened power of the American President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, for instance).  The Senate consisted of around 300 members who could be either patricians or plebeians.  Usually all magistrates had been Senators at some time.

The executive power in Roman politics was vested in the ''cursus honorum'', which constituted the order of posts one went through in the Roman hierarchy.  It comprised a mixture of political and military posts, each having a particular age requirement for election.  The ''cursus honorum'' began with a period of around ten years of service in the army, especially the calvary (the &quot;equites&quot;).  However, this requirement, because of nepotism, was not rigidly applied.  In fact, because of the absence of political parties, political advancement came almost exclusively through family ties and personal influence.  The next step (or first) after military service was the office of the quaestor, at the minimum age of thirty (men of patrician descent could subtract two years from all age requirements).  Quaestors automatically became Senate members; thus, the executive and legislative branches of the Republic were closely intertwined.  In total, there were eight to twelve quaestors who served for a period of one year.  They directed the financial affairs of the state, as well as supervising the Roman armies and officers.  Former quaestors could be elected to one of the four positions of aedile at the age of thirty-six, subtracting two for patricians.  Aediles were administrative positions charged with keeping public order and enforcing the law.  Half of the aediles came from the plebeian class and half from the patrician class.  This step in the ''cursus honorum'' was optional.  At the age of thirty-nine, former quaestors and aediles might be elected as one of six praetors, who had several functions.  Some held judicial positions; others served as governors of provinces not controlled by the consuls and commanded up to one legion.  The chief officers of the Republic were the two consuls, who held the highest powers in the government.  They were elected once a year and had to be at least forty-two years of age.  No one could be elected consul again except after a ten-year intervening period between consulships. The consuls controlled the city's political agenda, commanded the largest divisions in the army, and were in charge of important provinces.  Each had veto power of the actions of the other.  In addition to the these offices, there were two censors in the political hierarchy of Rome.  These former consuls held incredible power, because they conducted the census of Rome, which gave them power of who belonged to which &quot;tribe&quot; (not ethnic but bureaucratic), and controlled the roll of the Senate, giving them power over its membership.  They were elected every five years and served an eighteen month term (the only office not serving a one year term).  Another important position in Rome was that of tribune, a position held by aspiring plebeians which allowed them to balance out the power of the patricians.

Most officials in the Roman government held the power of ''imperium'', which meant absolute executive power, except by the veto of one possessing a higher level of imperium.  Imperium meant holding the power of life or death over the people.  Beginning with the position of aedile, imperium was a great honor that carried with it the privilege of lictors.  Lictors were special servants who accompanied magistrates and served them.  The number of lictors was symbolic of the power of the office held.  Lictors carried with them the ''faces'', a bundle of sticks with an axe within.  Inside of the city of Rome itself, the axe was usually removed and the number of lictors reduced, because the power to wield capital punishment towards Roman citizens was reserved for the  consuls and the dictator.

== Expansion and Conquest ==
=== 753-202 B.C.E ===
The early centuries of the republic heralded its rise to prominence in the Italian peninsula.  The tiny city-state was blessed with adept leadership and brilliant innovation.  In the period of 753-275 BC, most Italians practiced the Greek style of Hoplite warfare with phalanxes.  The Romans, who used the style initially, found it unwieldy and hard to manage in the mountainous and broken terrain of Italy.  So, they adopted the Legion.  The '''Legion''' was a band of recruited militia and made up of 6,000 soldiers, brought up in times of war from the middle and rich classes.  Since Rome was a military state, these soldiers' battle skills were without question and they often served in the army for 7-10 years, before being disbanded at the end of the conflict.  These citizen militias fought hard and received good pay and spoils of war if they succeeded in battle.  Through this method, the Romans conquered or allied with all the Italian city states south of the Po river by 275 BC
  
Rome's success attracted the eyes of other powers in the region.  Carthage, the Phoenician colony in modern day Tunisia, was already an established trading power and commanded a wealthy realm.  Rome and Carthage grew increasingly hostile over the place of Sicily in each other's sphere of influence and in 263 BC, Carthage and Rome went to war.  Rome defeated Carthage and her large fleet, without ever having fought a naval battle before, and conquered Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia.  The terms of the peace for Carthage were so extreme, that a young boy named Hannibal, son of one of Carthage's finest generals, felt immense hatred towards Rome.  Later on, he became a high ranking Carthaginian general, and after amassing a force in Spain, marched across the Alps to attack Rome in 222 BC, essentially starting the '''Second Punic War'''.  After making it through the mountains, Hannibal's army swept through Italy defeating every Roman army it came across, including one with more than twice their numbers at the '''Battle of Cannae'''.  However, the Romans continued to fight on.  A promising Roman general, Publilius Cornelius Scipio &quot;Africanus&quot;, came up with the strategy of drawing Hannibal away by invading Carthaginian Spain.  The plan worked to a degree, and within a year he had conquered all of Spain, essentially isolating Hannibal.  He then took the fight to Carthage itself, and at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, Hannibal and Carthage were defeated.  This time, the Romans stripped Carthage of everything, and reduced its empire to the area directly around the city.  Even her independence wasn't guaranteed by Rome and in the '''Third Punic War''' in 146 BC, the city of Carthage was sacked, its inhabitants enslaved, and the rest burned.

=== 215-133 BC ===
Roman expansion East started in the Second Punic War when the Carthaginians asked the Antigonid dynasty of Macedonia, one of Alexander's Successor Kingdoms, to assist them in defeating the Powerful Romans.  Needing to maintain peace on all fronts to focus on defeating their other Greek rivals, the Macedonians declared war in 215 BC.  This '''First Macedonian War''' had little fighting, but it forced the Romans to think of their neighbors to the east with an eye of suspicion.  After this war, the cities of Rhodes and Pergamum both sent emissaries to the Romans informing them of a secret plot of invasion by Macedon.  Thus sparked the '''Second Macedonian War''' 200-196 BC, saw the Romans attack Macedon to quench any expansionism by the Antigonids.  The Romans allied with the Aetolian League, a band of Greek city states who also distrusted Macedon.  The war ended quickly and decisively and forced a peace and Macedonian neutrality.  When the spoils of territory were assigned the Aetolian League received less territory then they believed they deserved, they invited the other Successor Kingdom, the Seleucid Empire to take over Greece from the Romans.  This '''Seleucid War''' was finished at the battle of Magnesia where the Romans under Scipio &quot;Africanus&quot; crushed the army of the Seleucid king at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC.  Thus, Rome gained a foothold in Asia Minor to be expanded upon later, and ensured the decay of the Seleucid Empire.  The last bid for Greek independence were the '''Third and Fourth Macedonian Wars''' 172-168 150-148 where the Macedonians fought against the Romans in a bid for supremacy.  They lost the Battle of Pydna in 148 BC and were forced to acknowledge Roman domination.  After all this destruction in the east, the king of Pergamum attempted to defuse a succession crisis in his nation by bequeathing it to the Romans.  After his death in 133 BC, his entire kingdom was granted to Rome and the wealth it contained would lead to darker times in the Republic.

== The Shift from Greek to Roman Dominance==

The Mediterranean civilizations of Greek and Rome were dominant during the Classical Era.  When the Roman Empire began to expand and conquered Greece, it adopted many of its customs, but also changed some parts of Greek society in order to fit the larger empire.  The main factors in the change from Greek to Roman dominance were in the political structure, the religion, and the types of intellectual and technological advancements.

Rome inherited some of its political characteristics from the Greeks.  In Greece there were various forms of government.  In the city-state of Athens, democracy was invented, and a small empire of colonies was created (Stearns 73, 81).  However, Sparta, another major city-state, was ruled by a militaristic aristocratic council (Stearns 73). Rome borrowed political structure from both of these forms of government, but also created some new policies of its own. When the Roman Republic began, it was an aristocratic council, but elected public officials to represent the general population (Stearns 73).  When Rome became an empire it &quot;allowed political autonomy in many states in order to keep its vast empire intact&quot; (Stearns 80).  The shift from Greek to Roman politics included many small changes.

The Greeks and Romans shared the same religion. The Greeks began a polytheistic religion that spread throughout their civilizations but did not extend to other parts of the world (Stearns 76).  The Greek religion had &quot;a complex religion of many gods and goddesses who regulated human life&quot; (Stearns 76).  These gods controlled natural forces as well as human emotions.  Romans had the same religions as the Greeks, but they adapted it to suit their own needs.  They used the same gods and goddesses as the Greeks, but they gave the gods different names (Stearns 76). The Romans also propagated the religion throughout the empire allowing it to spread more widely (Stearns 76).  Although there were some slight changes in the main religion during the shift from Greek to Roman dominance, the religion remained essentially the same.

The technological and intellectual advancements were very different because of the basic Greek or Roman worldview.  The Greeks were hypothetical thinkers who were mainly concerned with natural order (Stearns 77).  This meant that Greek advancements were mostly intellectual.  Most achievements were in science or mathematics “as a means of ordering nature’s patterns comprehensible” (Stearns 77).  Romans were much more practical.  They had wonderful engineering achievements including the creation of roads and aqueducts (Stearns 78).  The Romans' engineering accomplishments were a vital factor of the Roman Empire.  The technological advancements and the intellectual achievements made in the shift of cultural dominance are present in today’s academic theories and structural triumphs.

During the shift from Greek to Roman dominance many changes were made, but some similarities existed between the two cultures.  The Romans borrowed many of their features from Greeks.  Their political structures, religion, and intellectual and technological achievements united the two civilizations. This shift was also reflected in the languages spoken, the Western half of the empire would become Latinized, while the Eastern half would largely remain Greek speaking.

===Julius Caesar===

Julius Caesar was a powerful Roman politician who lived from 13 July 100 BCE – 15 March 44 BCE . His actions paved the way for his adopted son Octavian (later known as Augustus) Caesar to transform the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.

===Christianity appears in Rome===
===An Empire split in two===
The Roman Empire was divided into an eastern and a western half under the emperor Diocletian. This may sound like a simple administrative decision but it was actually a monumental shift in the way Roman affairs were conducted. There would now be two emperors, who would each appoint a &quot;Caesar&quot; under him to serve as his successor; Diocletian hoped this would put an end to the succession crises that had plagued the Empire. Also under Diocletian's reforms massive taxes were instituted to help prop up the Roman economy: the tax burden became so great that some hailed the barbarian invaders as liberators, merely because of their lower taxes. The tax burden was also highly unequal, with the senatorial classes being completely exempt. The new taxes caused people to want to quit their jobs and run away from the power of the empire so they were bound to the land, and many people were bound to the professions of their fathers. Here we can see the origins of medieval serfdom and the rise of the manor as more and more people fled the cities to the country, to escape growing poverty and starvation.

==The Decline and Fall of Rome==
The fall of the Roman Empire is an important and interesting event in World History.  Its fall marked the end of one of the greatest and longest-lived empires in the ancient world.  It is important to realize, before reading any further, that ''the Roman Empire fell due to entirely internal causes''.  The AP World History test takes this view, as do most historians.  Because of its self-weakened state, barbarian invasions were possible.  This was the ''immediate'' cause of the collapse.  This isn't to say that the Roman Empire ended entirely at one point in time either.  The Eastern half of the Empire, known from 476 AD onwards as the Byzantine Empire, would exist until 1453, a full thousand years later.

===Reasons for the decline and collapse===

From the time of Augustus to the time of Diocletian, there was no doubt that the Caesars intended to rule over a unified empire.  As the centuries passed, however, Italy, the hearth of Roman culture, became less and less influential in politics and the economic life of the empire.  Once a country of peasants with small landholdings, Italy by the third century C.E. had sent untold thousands of her native sons into the Roman legions, sending them away to the borders of the empire.  The small farms these men had owned had been swallowed up by huge agricultural estates, which were worked by hordes of slaves brought into Italy from all over Europe, Asia and North Africa. 

Rome's later imperial rulers -- the absentee aristocrats who owned the estates -- had a much more tenuous connection to the land and its traditional cultures than the Republic's peasant farmers had had.  These rich men enjoyed the wealth that poured in from Rome's conquered provinces, maintained primarily urban residences, and adopted a variety of non-Roman spiritual practices alongside Roman native traditions.  Early in the empire, Greek philosophical schools and systems became prominent on the Roman scene; as the first and second centuries passed, more and more urban Romans began to pursue cults and religions from the East, such as Persian Mithraism, Egyptian cults such as that of Isis, and, increasingly, Christianity.  Rome itself was a multinational metropolis whose population was heavily skewed toward slaves, freedmen and their descendants, mostly speaking an urban Greek rather than Cato's Latin.  The third-century rise of a line of emperors of Syrian origin was fully in line with all these developments.  The names and forms seemed continuous with the past, but great changes were underway.

Meanwhile, the outer provinces garrisoned by the legions began to diverge from the center.  In the West, Brittania, Hispania and Gaul retained local cultures strongly tied to the land, although their own elites lived Romanized lives in villas and towns.   Greece, Syria and Asia Minor gained wealth and influence from land and sea trade routes to India and Asia, becoming more and more distinct in this regard from the agricultural West.  Roman citizens in the provinces lived lives not directed from Italy.

Farms and estates were the wealth in the empire's economy, especially in the West.  The third century started to see a shrinking of the rural population within the Roman frontiers, as many peasants left the land for the towns.  Whole farming regions were abandoned, and Roman officials collected less and less tax revenue from them, despite attempts to restrict peasant movements and resettle vacant tracts.  The resulting lack of funds to pay soldiers, operate legal and administrative offices, and maintain roads and buildings, sapped the empire's cohesion.  Roman households lost their long-distance connections as the decades passed, turning inwards to make their estates and villas more self-sufficient, which further decreased trade and economic interaction between the provinces.  From a military standpoint, a weakened government was losing the ability to project power, to send legions from Syria to garrison Britain and Italians to guard the Rhine.  Short of funds, Roman generals found the best remaining way to motivate their troops was by having them defend their own homes.  Thus, Rome's legions, which had brought so many provinces under Italy's rule, by the third century were drawing many of their officers and men from those very same formerly vanquished provinces.

A lot can be attributed to the collapse of Rome.  The barbarian invasions are only the catalyst that brought on the gradual end of the empire. Over the centuries the costs of keeping large legions grew exponentially, mostly from the emperors' desires, not to have a well maintained military force, but to prevent a coup by rival generals.  Extravagances at home, both for the wealth given to patrician families, as well as the obscene costs of the games to keep the plebians happy, helped depress the economy along with various epidemics. Coupled with a series of poor harvests across the empire, the situation for the ailing giant became dire.  Further exacerbating the situation was the growing practice of hiring barbarians to defend the borders of Rome for lack of finding Romans or Romanized peoples to serve. This is largely attributed to universal citizenship towards the end of the empire; whereas before citizenship was either received by being born from citizens, or by serving in the Imperial legions.  It did not help that the empire was large and difficult to govern from Rome, despite the excellent road systems the empire had maintained. Marcus Arelius, the scholar emperor, spent most of his Imperium traveling the frontier trying to keep the empire together back in the mid to late 2nd century (161-180).  Few emperors after Arelius were as effective in administering the empire as he was, though there were some notable and great emperors such as Constantine and Diocletian, by and large many emperors were killed either by civil wars or the Praetorian Guard after only a short time wearing the purple, around 49 emperors in 104 years between Arelius and Diocletian, about an emperor every two years; afterwards the average Imperial reign lasted 3 years until the fall of Western Rome.  This is a great contrast to the average reign of 13 years of all the emperors from Augustus to Arelius.  The constant battles for the throne, coupled with high taxation and general breakdown of social order, left Rome too weak and crippled to fend off the barbarians.  However, it must be noted that the empire did not fall all at once, it was very gradual, there are some articles of some regions of the broken empire still considering themselves part of the Roman empire up to the early 8th century.  Coupled with the fact that the Byzantium/Eastern Roman Empire lasted until the mid 15th century, and that the Western World owes its culture, religion, and ideas largely to the Roman Empire makes them one of the longest and most successful empires in the existence of humankind.

Given a tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, the components &lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \ \mu \nu}_{\ \beta}&lt;/math&gt; are given by &lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \ \mu \nu}_{\ \beta}=\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{d}x^\alpha, \mathbf{e}_\beta, \mathbf{d}x^\mu, \mathbf{d}x^\nu)&lt;/math&gt;  (just insert appropriate basis vectors and basis one-forms into the slots to get the components).


So, given a metric tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v})=&lt;\mathbf{u} \ |\ \mathbf{v}&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, we get components &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}=&lt;\mathbf{e}_\mu \ |\ \mathbf{e}_\nu&gt;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu \nu}=&lt;\mathbf{d}x^\mu \ |\ \mathbf{d}x^\nu&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that &lt;math&gt;g^\mu_{\ \nu}=g_\mu^{\ \nu}=\delta^\mu_\nu&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;&lt;\mathbf{e}_\mu \ |\ \mathbf{d}x^\nu&gt;=&lt;\mathbf{d}x^\mu \ |\ \mathbf{e}_\nu&gt;=\delta^\mu_\nu&lt;/math&gt;.


Now, given a metric, we can convert from contravariant indices to covariant indices.  The components of the metric tensor act as &quot;raising and lowering operators&quot; according to the rules &lt;math&gt;w^\alpha=g^{\alpha \mu}w_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_\alpha=g_{\alpha \mu}w^\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  Here are some examples:


1.  &lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \ \gamma}_{\ \beta} = g_{\beta \mu}T^{\alpha \mu \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;


Finally, here is a useful trick:  thinking of the components of the metric as a matrix, it is true that &lt;math&gt;\left( g^{\mu \nu} \right) = \left( g_{\mu \nu} \right) ^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu \sigma}g_{\sigma \nu}=g^\mu_{\ \nu}=\delta^\mu_\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

The Interwiki linking system does not seem to play well with non-Western script.  Everything I've tried (and seen tried in the page history) results in either the wrong page, an invalid page, or the link and text is not displayed at all (like in the current page).

Until this is fixed, we should either not bother with the links, or use the same method as we would use for external linking.&lt;br&gt; [[User:Greyweather|Greyweather]] 21:38, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I am going to go ahead and do the latter. [[User:Greyweather|Greyweather]] 22:15, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)

==How should country listing be arranged?==
I was thinking of making the country list as complete as possible. But here lies a question, should the countries be listed with or without regional division? For example, look at Asia. It has been divided into East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Middle East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan just lists the countries under:
* Asia
* North America
* Central &amp; South America
* Europe (including NIS [Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union])
* Oceania
* Middle East
* Africa
without further divisions of East, South, West, etc -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 03:56, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: I suggest that since this list is to aid English-speakers find the Japanese vocabulary they are looking for, rather than educate them in how the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists these words, we should order them according to conventions in English speaking countries. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:48, 3 August 2008 (UTC)

:Because this is meant to aid native English speakers, wouldn't it be helpful to write the new country names in romaji? -- Anonymous  20:06, 3 August 2008

:: What do you mean by &quot;new&quot; country names? If you mean the Japanese words for the countries, then no. This book is for English speakers (native or otherwise) who are learning Japanese. The [[Japanese Phrasebook]] is the place for romaji. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:17, 4 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I mentioned in the first chapter that I frequently get questions about this or that topic in human sexuality from people - the less shy ones, I'd guess - who have recently learned about my research interests. Though some of the questions are unusual and unexpected, more often the same questions are just about the same: How often do people actually have sex? Is it normal for my husband to look at pornography? What size is the average penis?

I think the reason questions like those come up over and over again is that they are, fundamentally, ''normative'' questions. That is, they are questions about what is &quot;normal,&quot; what everyone else is doing. This is unsurprising: We humans do seem to have a natural curiosity about what other people are doing, especially in taboo areas like sex. More than that, though, it allows us to see how &quot;normal&quot; we are. Should I feel fulfilled with the amount of sex I'm having? Or - heaven forbid - am I some sort of pervert? Of course, demographic data can never really answer that sort of question. As the philosopher David Hume pointed out centuries ago, there is a great divide between the &quot;is&quot; and the &quot;ought.&quot; Sex research can tell you how close you are to what's ''average'', but it will never be able to tell you how close you are to what's ''right''. That's a question for other fields - philosophy, religion, perhaps law.

Nonetheless, questions about what people are doing and whom they're doing it with are some of the most interesting and fundamental in sex research. As a purely practical example, we can't combat the spread of AIDS if we don't know what sort of people have a lot of sexual partners, what sort of people are less likely to use condoms, and so on. On a more theoretical level, it's impossible to understand the effects of culture of sexual behavior if we don't know what that behavior is. Because of this fundamental importance (and because it's just so darn interesting), 

==Surveying the Field==

If you want to figure out what Americans think, do, or think other people do, the solution seems straightforward: Take a survey. Even if you know nothing about the mechanics of survey methodology, you probably have the impression that modern surveys are among the most marvelously useful things ever invented. And that they are. That's why you can hardly turn on the nightly news or read a major magazine without learning of a new survey. You're probably most familiar with political surveys (or polls, as they're more commonly called), which seem to track the public's opinion on every imaginable issue, from who the next President will be to whether the government should pay subsidies to Iowa corn farmers.

These sorts of surveys are not easy, of course, but as surveys go they're pretty routine. To give a quite simplified example: If you wanted to know who will win the upcoming race for mayor of your city, you could simply pick a couple of hundred numbers at random out of the local phone book, call them, and ask &quot;Who do you plan to vote for in the upcoming mayoral race?&quot; Add up the responses, and you've got your answer. This would certainly not be the most accurate survey in the world, but even in that simplified form it would give you a pretty good idea, as long as the race wasn't too close.

Taking surveys about sexual behavior is not so easy, though. Imagine your reaction if a stranger called your house some evening and asked how many times you'd had sex in the last month. Personally, I'd probably hang up on them immediately; who knows if they're actually researchers or just prank callers? And of course a reasonably comprehensive survey of American sexual behavior would have dozens of questions, some of them even more sensitive than that one, and require participants of every age, race, and religion from every state. The prospects for such a thing seem pretty dim.

For that reason, most sex surveys have not been of that conventional sort. The earliest and still most famous American survey was that by Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues.[Kinsey, et al., 1948] Kinsey and his many assistants.

Surveys of large groups have been conducted in the UK, France, New Zealand and Australia. Recently the [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arcshs/ Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health &amp; Society] was established.  [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/ashr/ Summary survey results] were also made available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This text serves as an introduction to '''Classical Greek''', appropriate for a first year course. This text is in the development phase. Please join the discussion if you'd like to contribute.

==Before You Begin==
As you probably already know, Greek and English use different alphabets. For this reason, you must ensure that your Internet browser can accurately render Greek lettering. If you don't, they will appear as gibberish. Below, you should see the first line of the Iliad.

::μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος

Don't worry if you can't read the letters yet (that's the first lesson). You should see five words with a few types of accents. If you see question marks or boxes (even if you see a few Greek letters interspersed), you need to install a font which supports Polytonic Unicode Greek or upgrade your browser. If the size of the font makes reading uncomfortable for you, you may wish to adjust your browser or display settings.

Hi folks. I think this would be great as a one-stop shop for general relativity info. There are actually a fair number of resources online for GR, but they're scattered and sometimes hard to find. In the textbook I'd like there to be a fairly good solid online/offline bibliography to help folks find those resources.

As for the text itself, I'm still sketching out an outline that might work. There's the obvious stuff, both mathematical - parallel transport, tensors, etc. - and physical - Einstein Cand Ricci tensors, etc. - but how much detail do you think is appropriate? I don't want to go the way of Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's famous tome, but nor do I want to be as sketchy as many of the online intros are. Suggestions warmly welcomed.

*I am the original designer of this Wikibook, and would like to revive it if possible. Go to &quot;IMPORTANT-Please read!&quot; section above; I have posted my intention to revive the text in that section.

So, here goes: when there is a moon in the rings of Saturn, there is a stripe around the entire ring. That moon is orbiting at a different speed from the moonlets. Thus Einstein's equivalence principle is disproved. Instead of warped space-time causing gravity, gravity causes warped space-time. In the atom, when the electron curves it radiates which causes it to slow down. There is an energy-producing system that replaces the lost energy, and it burns space-time as a fuel. The inflow of space-time is gravity. [[Special:Contributions/50.11.85.51|50.11.85.51]]


:I would oppose any change of this nature. Relativity has stood the test of time, and it will take more than vaguely worded claims of unclear relevance to shake it. [[User:Reyk|Reyk]] ([[User talk:Reyk|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Reyk|contribs]]) 18:41, 31 March 2015 (UTC)</text>

== Ordered selection (Permutation) ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Suppose there are 10 songs in your music collection and you want to shuffle play them all (i.e. the 10 songs would play in a random order). In how many different ways can the collection be played?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This type of problem is called ordered selection ([[w:en:Permutation|permutation]]), as we are '''selecting''' the songs from the collection in a '''certain order'''. For instace, these selections are considered different:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\ 
  7, 3, 10, 4, 9, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6 \\
  2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

These clearly define different orders or in effect, playlists.

Let's think this step by step. We can pick 10 different songs for the first position (or first song to be played), 9 for the second position (as there is 1 song already picked), 8 for the third (as 2 songs are fixed), and so on and so forth. The total number of ways can be calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;
Almost 4 million different playlists!


Now we shall introduce the [[w:en:Factorial|factorial]] function, which is a compact way of expressing:
:&lt;math&gt;n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;
Formally defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
  0! = 1 \\ 
  n! = n \times (n-1)!
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
So in our case:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
  10! = 10 \times 9! = 10 \times 9 \times 8! ... \\
  10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


What if we had 30 songs, but still wanted to shuffle just 10 of them? Similar reasoning leads to
:&lt;math&gt;30 \times 29 \times 28 \times 27 \times 26 \times 25 \times 24 \times 23 \times 22 \times 21&lt;/math&gt;
different ways.
This is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{30!}{20!} = \frac{30!}{(30-10)!}&lt;/math&gt;

{{colorbullet|#ffb017|Be cautious! The factorial function is '''not''' distributive over the addition or multiplication.}}

Generally speaking, the number of permutations of ''m'' items out of ''n'' (for instance, 10 songs out of 30) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-m)!}&lt;/math&gt;
The idea behind it is that we cancel out all but the first ''m'' factors of the ''n!'' product:
:&lt;math&gt;30! = \underbrace{30 \times 29 \times ... \times 22 \times 21}_{\text{First 10 factors}} \times \underbrace{20 \times ... \times 2 \times 1}_{(30-10)! = 20!}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''m'' equals ''n'' we say we are counting the number of permutations of ''n'' items:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{0!} = n!&lt;/math&gt;


While solving counting problems, we'll generally use the words items or [[w:en:Element_(mathematics)|elements]] (in this case, our songs) and [[w:en:Set_(mathematics)|sets]] (in this case, the collection or playlists).

 1. In how many ways can I arrange my bookshelf (7 books) if I own a trilogy and the 3 books have to be always together, in the same order?

 2. In how many ways can I arrange my family (6 members) in a line, with the only rule that my parents have to be in adjacent positions?

=== Permutation with repetition ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''How many different two-digit numbers can be formed with only odd prime digits (i.e. 3, 5, or 7)? Numbers 75, 37, 77, 33, are possible solutions.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a special case of permutations, the items may be selected more than once. Counting, we see there are 3 possibilities for every position, since digits may be repeated:

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{3 \times 3}_{\text{2 positions}} = 3^2&lt;/math&gt;

9 different numbers.

If we were to select ''m'' items out of ''n'', with possible repetition, there would be
:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{n \times n \times n ... \times n}_{\text{m times}} = n^{m}&lt;/math&gt;
permutations.
 1. How many three-digit numbers can be formed with only prime digits, and odd digits may only be repeated twice?

=== Circular permutation ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In how many ways can we sit 4 people (Alice, Bob, Charles, and Donald) at a round table?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is another special case of permutations, the 4 elements are arranged in a circular order, in which the start and end of an arrangement are undefined.

If we simply count
:&lt;math&gt;4!&lt;/math&gt;
there will be some repetitions. We'll be counting each unique arrangement more than once since layouts like
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
  \text{A, B, C, D} \\
  \text{D, A, B, C} \\
  \text{C, D, A, B} \\
  \text{B, C, D, A}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
are considered equivalent. Remember, there is no start in a round table.

{{colorbullet|#12aecc|There is no coincidence in having '''4''' &lt;s&gt;people&lt;/s&gt; chairs, and groups of '''4''' equivalent arrangements.}}

If we arbitrarily numbered the chairs, we could obtain all equivalent arrangements by cycling our whole layout. How many times we would cycle? How many chairs/positions are there? '''4'''.

Dividing our first intent by 4 (i.e. dividing in groups of 4 equivalent dispositions):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4!}{4} = 3!&lt;/math&gt;
6 '''unique''' dispositions.

Another way of approaching the problem is to forcibly define an arbitrary starting point for the layout, in other words, to fix one element and permute the other 3 left:
:&lt;math&gt;(4 - 1)! = 3! = 6&lt;/math&gt;
ways to sit four people at a round table.

 1. What if there are 7 people, but the table only has 5 chairs?

== Unordered selection (Combination) ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Out of the 15 people in the math class, 5 will be chosen to represent the class in a school wide mathematics competition. How many ways are there to choose the 5 students?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This type of problem is called an unordered selection ([[w:en:Combination|combination]]), as the order in which you select the students is not important. For example, these selections are considered equivalent:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
  \text{Joe, Lee, Sue, Violet, Justin} \\
  \text{Lee, Joe, Sue, Justin, Violet}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

As seen before, there are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{15!}{10!} &lt;/math&gt;
ways to choose the 5 candidates in '''ordered selection''', but there are ''5!'' ordered selections for each different combination (i.e. the same 5 students). This means we are counting each combination ''5!'' times. Consequently, there are
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{15!}{10! \times 5!}&lt;/math&gt;
ways of choosing 5 students to represent the class.

In general, the number of ways to choose ''m'' items out of ''n'' items is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-m)! \times m!}&lt;/math&gt;
We took the formula for permutations of ''m'' items out of ''n'', and then divided by ''m!'' because each combination was counted as ''m!'' ordered selections (''m!'' times).

This formula is denoted by:
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m} = \frac{n!}{(n-m)! \times m!}&lt;/math&gt; 

Note that &lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt; is often read as ''n choose m''. 
 1. Try not to use a calculator and think of the problem with groups of 1 student.

 2. Again, no calculator and this time there are 1 million students in the class and we want to form groups of 999,999 students.

=== Combination with repetition ===
In this particular case of combination problems, elements may be selected more than once. That is, groups can include many samples of the same element.

Knowing which elements are picked is not enough for defining a selection, we need to know '''how many times''' is an element selected (i.e. the amount of samples selected). Both approaches are, essentially, the same: saying an element was picked 0 times is equivalent to saying it was not picked at all.

Now suppose we were to select ''m'' elements out of ''n''. Instead of thinking the problem as &quot;choosing&quot;, we should think it as &quot;placing&quot; the ''m'' elements inside the ''n'' distinct sets. Again, both interpretations are equivalent.

Then we place on every set as many objects as samples we selected from the element the set represented.
The final step is to concatenate a string to identify the selection, for instance, representing each object (sample) with a square and set (element which the sample makes reference to) boundaries with a dash:
:&lt;math&gt;-\underbrace{{\blacksquare}{\blacksquare}{\blacksquare}}_{\text{First set/element}}-\underbrace{{\blacksquare}{\blacksquare}}_{\text{Second set/element}}-\underbrace{{\blacksquare}{\blacksquare}}_{\text{Third set/element}}-&lt;/math&gt;
This means we chose three samples from the first set (first element), two from the second set (second element), two from the third set (third element). In other words, the selection consists of three elements of the first kind, two elements of the second kind, two elements of the third kind. The string could represent a random group of five letters formed, solely, with letters A, B, C:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{A, A, A, B, B, C, C}&lt;/math&gt;

The concatenated strings consist of ''m'' squares, and ''n + 1'' dashes.
For example, the following represents three elements selected out of five:
:&lt;math&gt;-\underbrace{{\blacksquare}{\blacksquare}}_{\text{First set/element}}-\underbrace{}_{\text{Second set/element}}-\underbrace{{\blacksquare}}_{\text{Third set/element}}-\underbrace{}_{\text{Forth set/element}}-\underbrace{}_{\text{Fifth set/element}}-&lt;/math&gt;

Note that two dashes are fixed, and the other ''n - 1'' are positioned along the string forming ''n'' [[w:en:Set (mathematics)|sets]] of samples. There are ''n - 1 + m'' movable characters among ''n - 1 + m'' positions. The number of possible strings equals the number of ways to position ''m'' squares among ''n - 1 + m'', in other words, the number of ways to choose ''m'' positions out of ''n - 1 + m'':
:&lt;math&gt;{{n - 1 + m} \choose {m}}&lt;/math&gt;
Analogously, we could talk about positioning the ''n - 1'' dashes among the ''n - 1 + m'':
:&lt;math&gt;{{n - 1 + m} \choose {n - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since every string exclusively determines one selection or group, clearly the number of strings is equivalent to the number of groups or selections possible.

If we were to pack three fruits for long journey, and you only got bananas, apples, oranges, peaches, and kiwis, there would be
:&lt;math&gt;{{5 - 1 + 3} \choose {3}} = {{5 - 1 + 3} \choose {5 - 1}} = 35&lt;/math&gt;
possible groups to pack.

== Binomial coefficient ==
The [[w:en:Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]]
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt;
expresses the number of unordered groups that can be formed by choosing ''m'' elements from a set containing ''n''.

These are some basic and useful properties:
*The number of ways of choosing ''m'' elements out of ''n'' equals the number of ways of (not) choosing the remaining ''n - m'' out of the ''n'' elements. A group of selected elements defines another group of non selected elements.
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m} = {n \choose {n - m}}&lt;/math&gt;


*There is only one way to choose no elements, or to (not) choose them all.
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose 0} = {n \choose n} = 1&lt;/math&gt;


*There are ''n'' ways of choosing one element, or (not) choosing ''n - 1''.
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose 1} = {n \choose {n - 1}} = n&lt;/math&gt;


*The difference between
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt;
:and
::&lt;math&gt;{{n + 1} \choose m}&lt;/math&gt;
:is that in the first formula we are not counting the groups which include the element added in the second formula. The amount of groups size ''m'' which include a particular element from a set with ''n + 1'' elements is
::&lt;math&gt;{{(n + 1) - 1} \choose {m - 1}} = {n \choose {m - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:therefore
::&lt;math&gt;{{n + 1} \choose m} = {n \choose m} + {n \choose {m - 1}}&lt;/math&gt;


*The difference between
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose {m + 1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:and
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m}&lt;/math&gt;
:is that in the first formula we are counting groups with one more element than the ones in the second formula. Every group size ''m'' needs one &quot;missing&quot; element of the ''n - m'' remaining in order to grow to size ''m - 1''.
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m} \times (n - m)&lt;/math&gt;
:However, we must observe that we are counting every group size ''m + 1'' many times, ''m + 1'' times indeed. This is because the &quot;missing&quot; element can be any of the ''m + 1'' elements in the resulting group, in other words, ''m + 1'' groups size ''m'' (when associated with the right element) will formed the same group size ''m + 1''. How many groups size ''m'' can we formed by removing an element from a group size ''m + 1''?
::&lt;math&gt;{{m + 1} \choose 1} = m + 1&lt;/math&gt;
:This suggests
::&lt;math&gt;{n \choose {m + 1}} = {n \choose m} \times \frac{n - m}{m + 1}&lt;/math&gt;


=== Binomial expansion ===
The [[w:en:Binomial theorem|binomial expansion]] describes the algebraic expansion of following expression:
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^n&lt;/math&gt;
Take ''n'' = 2 for example, we shall try to expand the expression manually, we get
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = aa + ab + ba + bb&lt;/math&gt;
Take ''n'' = 3:
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^3 = (a+b)(a+b)(a+b) = aaa + aab + aba + abb + baa + bab + bba + bbb&lt;/math&gt;

We deliberately did not simplify the expression at any point during the expansion. As you can see, the final expanded form has four and eight terms, respectively. These terms are all the possible combinations of ''a'' and ''b'' in products of two and three factors, respectively.

The number of factors equals the number of [[w:en:Binomial|binomials]] ''(a + b)'' in the first product, which in turn equals ''n''.

In
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^n&lt;/math&gt;
there are ''n'' factors in each term. How many terms are there with only one ''b''? In other words, in how many ways can I place one ''b'' among ''n'' different positions? Or even better, in how many ways can I pick one position (to place a ''b'') out of ''n''?
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly we can work out all the coefficients of the other terms: 
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^3 = {3 \choose 0}a^3 + {3 \choose 1}a^2b + {3 \choose 2}ab^2 + {3 \choose 3}b^3&lt;/math&gt;

And more generally:
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^n = {n \choose 0}a^n + {n \choose 1}a^{n-1}b + {n \choose 2}a^{n-2}b^2 + ... {n \choose n-1}ab^{n-1} +  {n \choose n}b^n&lt;/math&gt;
Or more compactly using the [[w:en:Summation|summation]] operator:
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^n = \sum_{i = 0}^n {n \choose i}a^{n-i}b^i&lt;/math&gt;

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 1 ===
How many different ways can the letters of the word ''BOOK'' be arranged?

=== Exercise 2 ===
How many ways are there to choose five diamonds from a deck of cards?

=== Exercise 3 ===
Joey wants to make himself a sandwich. He will use ham, cheese, salami, tomato, and lettuce but does not like the ham and the salami to be touching each other. He always puts the lettuce on top.
In how many ways can Joey arrange the ingredients of his sandwich?

=== Exercise 4 ===
Rachel wants to buy an ice-cream cup. She picks three different flavours from a total of ten but does not like mixing chocolate with vanilla.
How many different ice-cream cups can Rachel order?

=== Exercise 5 ===
Joey is still hungry and wants to eat another sandwich. He can use ham, cheese, salami, tomato, and lettuce (there is no need to use them all). He does not want the ham and the salami to be in the same sandwich.
How many different sandwiches can Joey make (the order of the ingredients inside the sandwich does not matter)?

&lt;[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 01:51, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)&gt; It seems like a couple of points are missing.  
* That 一人 and 二人 are read differently should be indicated in the table itself, and not just in a comment in the beginning.  There should be an indication that the counters -人, -日, (and others) are special in this regard.
* That the pronunciation for the counter changes depending on how it sounds with the number, e.g. 三杯 is pronounced さんばい instead of さんはい.  If there is no consistent rule, then there should be a way to indicate the exceptions in the table.  If there is a mostly consistent rule, then the exceptions should be noted.
* There should some indication of which is preferred of し/よん　and しち/なな.  Such as 四月 (しがつ, not よんがつ).  Similarly you don't say しにん for 四人 (よにん, よんにん).
&lt;/[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]]&gt;

:Seems good points (BTW, we don't say よんにん for 四人, just よにん (or is it Hougen maybe?)) - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 09:11:35, 2005-08-25 (UTC)

What does the &quot;ゃ&quot; mean in ちゃく (chaku)? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 15:31, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:What do you mean? You probably know ちゃ is normally written as cha ([[Japanese/Kana Chart]])... although I prefer to type &quot;tya&quot; for ちゃ (&quot;cya&quot; can also be used) - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 09:11:35, 2005-08-25 (UTC)

::Hey, thanks for the reply, but (as you can see from the timestamp) that was and old comment when I first getting into Japanese and somehow I missed out on the y-group modifiers the first time around. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 14:50, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

==About example table==
#I removed 度 for Times (occurrences) for and replaed it by 回 / removed カロリー and replaced it by ジュール (you can revert if you want, but I recommend キロカロリー)
#インチ, フィート, ポンド(mass), ガロン, マイル are rarely used in Japan (thus, in Japanese conversations). Are they needed? In fact, in aviation people use them. But other than the field... (ヤード is a bit popural 'cos it's used in golf)
#Added examples mainly just for 1, 2, and 10. Might seem ugly, or, might be inadequate (all the 1 - 10 is needed?)
#It's quite difficult task for me to determine whhter to use, じっこ or じゅっこ (or this kind of じっ/じゅっ problem)! See [[w:Japanese counter word#Exceptions]] for detail. For instance, in [http://matsuri.site.ne.jp/taro/taro113.htm this page (ja)], じゅっこ gets 115 votes while じっこ just garners 14 votes. This exmple shows what (at least younger generation) Japanese feel. Anyway, what I've selected were just by ''my feelings'' ;) I don't have any strong opinion on this issue. Please feel free to edit (you may want to set all for じっ or じゅっ, or...).

::&quot;じっ&quot; is understandable, but don't sounds naturally. Most Japanese people pronounce &quot;十&quot; as &quot;じゅっ&quot; in the discussed cases. Though there is an exception in an antiquated noun: &quot;十手(じって、じゅって)&quot;, there would be no exception in counters (in the standard). -- [[User:Tohru|Tohru]] 05:53, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''onomatopoeia''' (オノマトペ) is a word or group of words in a language which have their meaning indicated by the sounds they mimic. Examples of English onomatopoeia include &quot;meow&quot;, &quot;roar&quot;, &quot;buzz&quot;, &quot;boom&quot;, &quot;snap&quot;, &quot;bang&quot;, and so on. In general, the Japanese word to refer to this concept is ''giseigo'' (擬声語).

However, Japanese not only contains words for sound effects, but also what is termed &quot;Japanese sound symbolism&quot; - basically, onomatopoeia describing things that don't actually make sounds. Officially, the former is called ''giongo'' (擬音語) and the latter ''gitaigo'' (擬態語). (''Giseigo'' is an umbrella term that refers to both of these)

== Giongo ==

擬音語 ''giongo'' are words which describe a sound. Most ''giongo'' are written in katakana. Some examples are:

擬態語 ''gitaigo'' are words that describe an action, state, or emotion by an associated sound. They are typically written in hiragana. Some examples are:
{{Japanese vocabulary entry|begin}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
 | English = bulge ripple, muscular physique
 | Japanese= ムキムキ

 | notes = ira-ira}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry
 | english =  to be soaked
 | japanese= びっしょり
 | reading = 
 | notes = bisshori}}
{{Japanese vocabulary entry|end}}
.

== Note on katakana vs. hiragana writings ==

In a typical style of Japanese writing ''giongo'' are written in katakana, while ''gitaigo'' are written in hiragana. However, this rule is not always observed. There are subtle nuances involved if you were to write one of these words in hiragana vs. katakana - katakana gives a kind of &quot;harder&quot; tone, while hiragana is &quot;softer&quot;. Often, it is the author's discretion which to use.

Some drink recipes appear under cuisines, like Bubble Tea, we should add those links too I think.
--[[User:OMouse|OMouse]] 2:27EST, 27 Feb 2005

==List of Cocktails==

There are a couple of recipes at Wikipedia under [[w:List of cocktails]].  We should probably move them over to this page. --[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 04:10, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

:Put them on the [[Bartending:Cocktails]] page. There are too many name conflicts (like '''Apricot Pie''') to put cocktails in the cookbook. (plus the wiki formatting is almost always crude, with bad links and missing headers -- clearly, people are testing the cocktails before adding them to the wiki) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:36, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Wine==

:Our Bulgarian friend has put a page about wine regions.
:How will ''wine'' be treated in the Cookbook in general?
:Nearly every Cookbook I know has good suggestions about what wines to take with food. Perhaps we should have the general red wines and white wines and the table/cask wines, as well as foods where wine is an important ingredient.
--[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 05:08, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::As needed, we can link to the [[Bartending]] book. Let's keep the cookbook simple and clear, with an emphasis on '''''cooking'''''. Note that there is also a [[Gardening]] book, and there could be a book for brewing and winemaking. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:36, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Cross-linking==

This module states: ''Alcoholic beverages are covered elsewhere, in the [[bartending]] book.''
[[Bartending:Alcoholic Drink]] states: ''See also [...] [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]] in the [[Cookbook]] for drink recipes not normally considered part of mixology.''

Moreover, [[Cookbook:Alcoholic Drink]], where the information is ''de facto'' at, is now listed under &quot;ingredients&quot; in the main module. --[[User:Salleman|Salleman]] 10:57, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== General Architecture Issues ===
A game's framework is basically all the programming that goes into the creation of the game but does not directly implement any of the gameplay. This can be the the code that manages the display, access to files, sound and other peripherals.

There is no one size fits all framework for video games. Each game requires a selection of components and strategies for linking them together. Using a freely available or even licensing a popular framework has the benefit that you will not need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; and get support and collaboration in solving issues and extending capabilities. In fact the only advantage in creating your own framework is to have control over it, this can be due to the need of implementing something that other oppose or simply to get monetary compensation from that specific work and license it to others. 

==== Choosing an API (Application Programming Interface) ====
There are a large number of [[w:API|API]]s that are suitable for Game Programming. APIs range from specialty (Graphics only, such as OpenGL) to very, very broad (windowing, graphics, networking, etc are available in ClanLib)

* [[w:OpenGL|OpenGL]] -- Specifically, this is a graphics library. Some other APIs can integrate very nicely with OpenGL (such as SDL). It is also cross-platform.

* [[w:DirectX|DirectX]] -- A set of APIs by [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]], specifically for machines running Windows, though it is on some other Microsoft platforms(xbox 1 used an modified version of the DirectX API). They include sound, music, graphics, input, and networking.

* [[SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)]] -- A good C-based library that is very portable, and while pretty low-level, it is complete enough to control sound, graphics, and input (from joysticks, keyboard, mouse and CD-Rom). zlib/png license.

* [http://www.sfml-dev.org/ SFML] -- An Object Oriented C/C++/.Net API supporting audio, graphics, window handling, multi-threading, networking, and input (from mouse, keyboard and joysticks).

* [[w:Allegro|Allegro]] -- An easy to use library for C/C++ programs. Cross-platform (supports Windows, DOS, Mac OS X, UNIX, and BeOS). Provides functions for graphics, sounds, input, and timers.

* [[w:ClanLib|ClanLib]] -- A C++ toolkit and OpenGL 2.0 wrapper.

This book is rather different. The system used here focuses on vocabulary, and exposes how words are used and sentences are formed through direct examples. In each lesson, you'll be introduced to only 10 new words. Additional word forms (using various affixes) and phrases are also introduced. The sentences, dialogs, and readings show how these words are used in context. After studying the 10 new words, you should be able to understand all the sentences, dialogs, and readings. Sentence structures will range from simple to complex.

Hi folks. I jumped on this text because I think it'll be reasonably straightforward, at least in the early stages. Everyone has to learn the alphabet, definite articles, and so on, so I thought I'd get it started and hope some other folks join in.

I'm going to set up a page on the alphabet and pronunciation, which is the necessary first chapter. Then I'll worry about what comes next. Do please offer suggestions.

--[[User:George McAllister|George McAllister]] 21:02, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Is there any activity on this anymore, or just the initial creation?  I would like to help.  Have you thought about the structure of the wikibook?

I may be adding things as I think of them, but it would be nice to keep flow with a ToC or other pre-planned format.

--[[User:Euphoria|Michael Greene]] 12:23, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I would also be interested in helping, however, I lack the experience and knowledge to take a leadership role. I am a beginning ancient/classical Greek student with goals of studying post-grad classics. My hope is that working on a wiki like this from the early stages will reinforce my grammar studies, provide experience in shaping how the language can be taught, and learn more about the wikibook project.

As a beginner, where I might be of best use now would be in populating grammar tables and paradigms, researching examples, and other important, though time-consuming details. It could be that a more experienced Greek teacher could provide guidance about the overall arc of the course, the pace, etc., but would be less enthusiastic, as an example, about sitting down to type out tables. Perhaps that's where I can help.

Michael, I agree that a ToC is the place to start, at least one that covers the true and most unavoidable fundamentals, e.g. all parts of speech, present tense verbs, esp. to be.

To keep things moving, I typed up a table of definite articles (one of those unavoidables). I would post it but 1) I'll have to figure out how to edit/supplement the current ToC and 2) The table presupposes some other fundamentals, such as case and number, that may need to be written first.

Sorry for the dry first post, but you have to start somewhere. This could be fun (if we're already at the point of reading the AG discussion page, we must get some pleasure from studying the language, right?).

-Patrick

Anyone still coming around here to talk? I can help on a limited basis. I've done page layout work for myself and professionally. I have taught Latin and Greek at the college level part time (got the sheepskins and everything), and I have some experience with computers. One thing that will help right up front, is a resource that's been around for a long time. It's a really good web page, though my thought is that this Wikibook either needs to ''create'' a similar page, or we need to get permission to link directly to the page I am referring to.

The page has a '''''very''''' nice list of free and for sale Greek fonts, as well as instructions for displaying ancient Greek in a web browser and sections of test text that the viewer can use to verify that the browser is working properly. The URL is http://www.tlg.uci.edu/help/UnicodeTest.html. 

The main site is for the TLG (Thesaurus Linguae Graecae), which is an academic project to digitize all remaining Greek literature to make it computer usable-accessible. The project has already been around for about 20 years.

Another good source to link to would probably be the Perseus Project at Tufts University: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/. They have a wicked large amount of stuff already available on the web, including pictures, grammar aids, texts, maps, etc. Though I'm thinking the text portion might best be saved until '''after''' the students of this book here are ready for more challenging Greek texts! :-)

[[User:Darklon|Darklon]] 09:50, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:Ah, great! The unicode fonts page looks good: I've added Perseus as a general resource, though I'm not sure if we should have a section (or even a page) directed at fonts. I suppose Wikibooks predetermines most of the layout, but it's still customiseable (e.g. see the modern greek pages). I'm aware that I may have messed up the IPA for the alphas and etas on the alphabet page, by the way (I did it all from memory); I will check - the problem comes trying to work out what changes came when! 
:Anyway, what I propose be done is that in each chapter, we havbe three sections: one for technical details: grammar, morphology, and so forth, one for teaching: Greek sentences or paragraphs with English translations (possibly some vocab), and the third for exercises: parsing, translations, compositions, and perhaps comprehension exercises (perhaps vocab glossed).
:Bearing in mind that we won't have the resources to write our own lexicon, I suspect we willl have to encourage people to use Perseus beyond the first few chapters.

Hi all, I've added some material to the nouns section. Does anyone know of a way to put a line over the vowels to indicate that they're long? It'd be really helpful since accentuation depends so much on vowel quantity. 

[[User:Umop Apsdn|Umop Apsdn]] 19:03, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

down the bottom of the edit window there are a whole lot of vowels with accents and macrons etc. (macrons are what you are looking for - the line over the long vowels) if that it too laborious then you can write your edit in a word processing document with greek script and then copy it into the editing window. hope this helps [[User:Storeye|Storeye]] 11:58, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

Hello everyone. I was tempted to append the nouns page with a simple explanation of the second declension and modify the table that's already been posted for the first declension to include some masculine and feminine omicron-sigma stem nouns and maybe one or two neuter omictron-nu stems, but I decided I should run it by the group before I do anything (I could e-mail or post my handiwork if it sounds like a good idea to run it by everybody). I agree with a previous post that maybe it should be more divided up with some exercises, as it is an instructional text and if its present form is expanded it may just read like the wikipedia article on ancient greek. I'm only a beginner, and I study alone at that (out of Mastronarde's &lt;i&gt;Attic Greek&lt;/i&gt;, which I only recommend for the very serious), but working with such grammars I can do quite a bit of grunt work (though my knowledge of the differences between the different dialects is severely deficient, so i can really only speak for the Attic variety). Nice work so far, hope I can be of some assistance because I'm very excited about such a project. 

p.s. I don't know how to use whatever code it is that's been used for the tables and script thus far, and i've been trying to work with my character map, which takes a long time and lacks a rough breathing sign. If anyone could fill me in on the right way to do this, I'd be glad to.

== Homeric, Attic, or Koine? ==

Well, I'm new to this site, so I'll admit I haven't looked through this much; but at a quick glance and a scroll, I haven't been able to tell just how ancient this Greek is. Will this be Homeric, Attic, Koine, or what?
-Thanks.

== Work on Ancient Greek ==

Hi people,

I was planning on doing some work on this textbook since it looks like it hasn't been modified in a few years. I'm a PhD student in classics and I thought I would add a bunch of material, but I don't want to step one anyone's toes. Let me know if I should refrain because someone is currently working on it.

Thanks.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I feel that food can be divided into two categories: That which crawls; That which sprouts. First, I'll cover plants, then I'll say some about ways to get meat.

== Growing, Catching, and Preparing Food - An Overview ==

If you are facing the prospect of gathering and / or catching food in the wild, you are facing one of two circumstances: this is a lifestyle choice, or you're in a long-term survival situation, where chances of rescue within weeks are slim.

The time frame of weeks may surprise some, but the reality is that in most survival situations, food is the least important factor, i.e., if you make it your number one survival priority, you'll probably get killed by something more important like not having sought adequate shelter while you were chasing badgers with a pointy stick. But getting down to brass tacks...

Chances are, you're not going to develop the skills necessary to hunt wild animals without firearms in any immediate timeframe, so the next option available to us is to prepare snares and traps. Snares and traps have the distinct advantage that they are hunting for you night and day, rain or shine. A simple circuit of your traps once a day is all that is required. The most important, and hopefully obvious consideration with traps is site selection: place traps where animals will be. Bait is fine, but to have bait, you have to have already caught something, haven't you? If you haven't, consider that animals invariably seek water, so a simple snare along a well worn path to the creek is perfect.

Types of Traps:
*Deadfalls
*Snares
*Cage Traps
*Nets
*Fishing Lines

== Edible &amp; Poisonous Wild Plants ==

Here are some guideline for eating wild plantlife. In most situations, if you don't know what a plant is, don't eat it. You can live 3 weeks or more without food. You can live a lot less long with poison in your system. Only eat wild plants if you have devoted a good deal of time to studying them.

* Do not eat mushrooms or fungi unless you know for certain that it is edible. Most are poisonous, and there is no way of determining which ones are edible without properly identifying the species.
* Plants with umbrella-shaped flowers should not be eaten.
* Avoid legumes (beans and peas).
* Bulbs should generally be avoided. Wild garlic and onions are edible but have poisonous look-a-likes. However, garlic and onions smell distinctively like garlic and onions.  
* Lichen 
* Avoid white and yellow berries, as most of them are poisonous. Blue and black berries are usually safe to eat.
* The &quot;berry rule&quot; is that 10% of white and yellow berries are edible; 50% of red berries are edible; 90% of blue, black, or purple berries are edible, and 99% of aggregated berries are edible.  This is only a guideline, and unknown berries shouldn't be eaten.
* Aggregated fruits and berries are almost always edible (blackberry, raspberry, salmonberry, and thimbleberry).
* Single fruits on a stem are usually considered safe to eat.
* Plants with shiny leaves or a milky sap are considered to be poisonous. The two that don't follow this rule are Dandelion and Fig. (Both have milky sap.)
* It is a myth that if an animal eats something, then it is safe.  For instance, deer will eat poison ivy.
* Wild nuts that taste or smell like almonds are EXTREMELY dangerous. They contain hydrogen cyanide.
* Wild fruits and berries can be checked for edibility in the following way:
# Put a small amount of juice on your forearm and wait until it dries.  If there is no burning, swelling or redness go to the next step.
# Put a small amount of juice on the corner of your mouth and wait until it dries. If there is no burning or stinging go to the next step. 
# Put a small amount of juice on your tongue. If there is no burning or stinging go to the next step.  
# Eat a very small amount. (If you immediately feel sick or vomit, stop eating!) If no symptoms occur in 24 hours, the item MOST LIKELY is not poisonous.
# Eat sparingly at first, and if symptoms still do not occur, proceed to eat as much as you like.

NOTE:  This technique can be very dangerous.  Many plants (Agave, to name one example) contain compounds that won't burn or tingle, but can be powerful emetics and/or laxatives.  Others may be safe in small quantities, but can be dangerous when large amounts are eaten.  Your best bet is to familiarize yourself with a few common plants for your area that can be eaten, and not rely on potentially dangerous methods such as the one listed above.

== Animals ==

There are three main types of meat you can get in a survival situation: Insects, fish, and game. Here they are covered in that order; easiest to hardest.

All mammals and birds are edible. Some must be boiled or roasted until tender, though.

Do not eat dog/wolf liver, it contains high levels of vitamin A which can lead to hypervitaminosis and death.

Eating a long term diet of only rabbits can lead to &quot;rabbit starvation&quot; and death. Rabbits have no fat which your body needs.

=== Insects ===

In many places, insects are a staple of local diets.  Some basic guidelines for insect eating:

* Avoid brightly colored insects.
* Avoid insects that bite or sting.
* Avoid fuzzy or hairy insects.
* Most worms and grub are good to eat. It helps to toast grub until they are dried.
* Some ants are good food. Dip a stick in water after letting it be coated by ants; repeat until you have enough.
* Before eating grasshoppers and crickets, remove their wings and legs. (They scratch on the way down.)
* Only eat fresh, healthy insects.
* Grasshoppers can contain tape worms, grab them behind the head and hold their body and pull out the stomach and intestines, and it is a good idea to line them up on a small stick and roast them on a rock by a fire.

=== Fish ===

Fish are easier to catch than wild game. It's best to go fishing in the morning and at dusk; just after sunrise and before sunset. In streams, look for deep still pools, undercut banks, and the areas around and behind sandbars. In lakes, bass gather around cover. Try areas around plantlife, sunken logs and boulders, docks, and areas around dropoffs and ledges. In the ocean, try reefs, points, deltas, and channels. Here I have listed some ways of catching fish, along with how to use these ways to catch various types of fish:

==== Common Types of Fish ====

; [[w:bass|Bass]]
: live in lakes and ponds. They like warm, clear, slow-moving water. They gather around cover (as mentioned above). A predatory fish, they like large worms, frogs, liver and other organs, crickets and grasshoppers, any meat, and crayfish. They average about 2-5 pounds.  Bass weighing 8 pounds or more are uncommon, but not unheard of.

; [[w:Catfish|Catfish]]
: are bottom feeders living in lakes, ponds, channels, and slow-moving rivers. There are also saltwater species. They like deep water, and will eat anything strong and smelly, such as meat, organs, and cheese. They have even been caught using things such as bubblegum and cottonballs soaked in meat juices. They are also one of the only fishes that can caught by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodling noodling]. For using a rod &amp; reel, put bait and a heavy weight on the end of you line. Then, throw it out into the deep water at the middle of a lake. Let it sit there until a catfish comes across it. As for weight, they are usually around 2-5 pounds, though the biggest on record was 646 pounds!

; [[w:Bluegill|Bluegill]]
: are small fish sometimes called panfish and bream. They are caught on either flies or live bait. They gather around underwater vegetation. The average weight is a pound or two.

==== Techniques ====

; [[w:Fishing rod|Rod &amp; Reel]]
: Using a rod &amp; reel is one of the best ways to catch fish. You can use it in the normal fashion, or use the line and hooks to make &quot;set lines.&quot; (See below.)

; [[w:Fishing net|Nets]]
: Nets, when properly placed, can provide a wealth of food. Lay one down in a creek with a line tied to each corner. Wait till fish swim over it, then lift it up. Also, try tying one under a waterfall. As fish pass over the falls, they get caught in the net. Also a &quot;gill net&quot; consists of thin strands of material making a &quot;curtain&quot;. When fish take water in through their gills, they draw in the strands and suffocate.

; Set Lines
: Your time can be used more efficiently by setting many fixed lines from things such as tree branches overhanging water. This is the same technique used by trappers; rather than hunt one animal at a time, they set dozens of traps, increasing their odds of catching something.

; [[w:Spear fishing|Spearfishing]]
: Fish can be harvested with a spear. To make an improvised fishspear: Find a long, strait pole or piece of bamboo. Wrap a piece of cord (tightly) around one end, about a foot from the end. Split the end of the pole evenly in half. The split will stop at your cord wrap. Sharpen the two points. You may also fire harden them.
: To use it, stand perfectly still in waist deep water. If you have bait to spare, you may scatter some around you if you wish. Keep the spear-point in the water and move it VERY slowly towards a fish. When your point is a foot or so away from it, jab it sharply, pinning it to the bottom. Try to make the fish slip between the two points, wedging it. Wedging it is better than piercing it; stabbing it can mess up the meat. Now, reach down and grab it firmly; as long as it's still in the water, it can fight with amazing power. Throw it on the bank and continue fishing.

; Fishtraps
: You can construct fishtraps out of vines, bamboo, wire, or plastic jugs. As a rule, the time it would take you to construct a fish trap (if you could at all) is best spent on other things. However, I'll still include directions for their construction. To make a simple fishtrap from a large narrow-mouthed plastic jug: Cut the top few inches off of the jug, widening the hole just enough allow comfortable access for a fish. Then, cut the top third off of the jug. Invert the removed section, and stick it in the rest of the jug, creating a funnel. Secure it in this position. Put bait in the jug. Fish will be &quot;funnelled&quot; in towards the bait, but will be unable to exit. You are actually more likely to catch crawfish and lobsters than fish with this! The same design is used to make woven and wire traps. (If someone knows the exact way to weave traps, put it here!) Also, on a beach, you can build a fishtrap from logs and stones: When the tide is low, create an inland-facing halfcircle of logs and stones. The tide comes in, and the trap is submerged. When the tide goes out, fish a trapped in the halfcircle as the water level drops. They may then be picked up.

; Fishing Poisons
: There are some plants that deoxidise water (remove oxygen). When added to a small pool of still water, they cause fish to suffocate and float to the surface. Because you did not actually poison them, there is no danger when eating fish caught this way. (The green husks from the Chestnut tree and the Black Walnut tree can be added to still water to stun fish. (Illegal, but in a survival situation it is good to know) Also the pods from the Black Locust Bean Gum tree (Arkansas) 
; [[w:Noodling|Handfishing]]
: With practice, you can actually catch fish by hand. When you catch catfish in this way, it is called noodling. (Catching catfish uses a special technique, not covered here.) To catch fish by hand: Find an undercut bank over still water. Laydown on your belly on the ground next to the water. Stick your hand in the water. Move very slowly and gingerly until you feel a fish. Work your hand under his belly. Grip firmly and lift him out. This is kind of like spearfishing with your hand. It takes a lot of practice.
Older people have mentioned tickling the fish, then jamming your thumb into the gills for extra grip.

==== Next Step ====

Now that you have a fish (or several fish) you should scale and clean them. (Instructions for scaling and cleaning to be added.) You can eat the heart and liver. Save the other organs for bait. Cut open the stomach to see what the fish has been eating, so you can get an idea of what bait to use. If the stomach is empty, it means that the fish are very hungry, and will bite almost anything. You can put the head on a large hook and drop in the water to catch a snapping turtle. Scatter whatever is left in the water to attract other fish.

==Grammar==
In general, the &quot;to be&quot; verb is not present in the [[Hebrew]] language.  So &quot;He David&quot; translates to &quot;He is David&quot;.  Or {{Hebrew| הִיא שָׂרָה  }} -- &quot;She is Sarah&quot;.                      
 
==Exercises==
===Who is who?===
This exercise using the following extra words:&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| מִי}} --  who ''mi'',&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large| שָׁלוֹם}} --  Hello; Goodbye ''shalom''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and some names:&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|שָׂרָה}} (Sarah),&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|יַעֲקֹב}} (Jacob),&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|משֶׁה}} (Moses),&lt;br&gt;
{{Hebrew-Large|רָחֵל}} (Rachel)&lt;br&gt;

Now try some simple sentences
# {{Hebrew-Large|  מִי הוּא}}
# {{Hebrew-Large|  הוּא יַעֲקֹב}}
# {{Hebrew-Large|  שָׁלוֹם שָׂרָה }}

===Without diacritic marks===

# אני
#  את 
# היא
# הוא
#  אתה

Thanks for the effort you went to hunting down those three pages that may needed to be deleted (or trans-wikied to a different language version for Wikibooks (use the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{transwiki}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag instead)). But, you must remember to add your reason for adding the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{VfD}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag on the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page. This is because we can't read your mind, and need to know that there is a page that needs to be considered for deletion (it may be fine to lump all three into one vote, because they have been marked for the same reason, I assume).

{{recipe}}  | [[Cookbook:Curry|Curry]]

'''Curry Chicken''' - This dish isn't that hot unless you make it that way.  In fact, change the ingredients to suit your own taste and it will probably taste better. Instead of coconut cream or milk you can use thickening cream.

==Ingredients==
* 1 whole cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* 2 tablespoons plain [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]] (or to taste)
* 1 tin of [[cookbook:Coconut|coconut milk]] or [[cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 1 brown [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] 
* 4 drops of [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco sauce]] (or to taste)

==Procedure==
#Cut onions fine and fry them.
#Add flour, curry, Tabasco, and cream or coconut milk.
#Add chicken.
#Let [[cookbook:simmering|simmer]] for 10 minutes.
#Serve with [[cookbook:rice|rice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this textbook, brought to you cooperatively by the Korean, Japanese, and Chinese language textbooks, we hope to illustrate some principles of East Asian writing systems that apply to all three languages above.

Whether we are talking about Chinese characters, Japanese kana, or Korean jamo, East Asian writing systems share many similarities, including their stroke forms, basic shapes, and character structure.

Nevertheless, there are also some differences. Not all of the lessons in this textbook apply to all of the languages. Depending on the language that you are learning, you will (fortunately) be able to skip over some lessons and sections.

In the following table of contents, each link is preceded by one or more letters. The letters indicate which writing system each unit applies to. The letters are:&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''hinese characters, including Chinese hanzi, Japanese kanji, and Korean hanja&lt;br&gt;
'''J'''apanese kana, especially hiragana&lt;br&gt;
'''K'''orean hangul

If a lesson isn't required for the language that you're learning, feel free to skip it.

Note that this course is strictly focused on writing nicely and legibly, and is meant as a supplement to the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean wikibooks. It does not teach you the actual characters / kana / hangul themselves.

With practice the concept of slope for linear functions becomes intuitive.  It makes sense that the line that fits the equation &lt;math&gt; y=2x &lt;/math&gt; has a steeper ascent then the line that fits the equation &lt;math&gt;y=1/2x&lt;/math&gt;.  You only have to move horizontally one unit to change your vertical direction two for the former when you graph &lt;math&gt; y=2x &lt;/math&gt;. How many blocks do you need to move horizontally to change your vertical direction by one for the line &lt;math&gt;y=1/2x&lt;/math&gt;.  When we express concepts like &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; the abstract behavior of what is being represented becomes a little harder to see.  

A '''monomial''' of one variable, x, is an algabraic expression of the form

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; c x^m \  &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/center&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and &lt;br&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

The integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''degree''' of the monomial.

The idea of a monomial of degree zero appears a bit mystical since it always represents one, except when the value of the variable is set equal to zero when the result is undefined. This idea allows us preserve the value of the constant in the monomial.  We know that &lt;math&gt;cx^0&lt;/math&gt;is always equal to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;because even though we have 0 x's (somethings) we still have a c.  When x = 0 things are difficult because the value we started with, 0, represents nothing.  

For a monomial of power 1 we are multiplying C by one instance of our variable.  When &lt;math&gt; x=0 &lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;c*0=0&lt;/math&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt; we are multiplying c by 1 x.  If x is less than 1 then c gets smaller, if x is more than 1 c gets bigger.  When x is between 0 and -1 c gets smaller slower, when x is less than -1 c gets smaller faster.

A monomial with power two is one that &quot;squares&quot; the value of x.  The reference to square is because using the multiplication operation once allows us to measure area.  If you have something that is one unit on each side this is called a square unit.  If you divide both sides of your square unit in half, you get 4 quarter units.  We represent this with math by doing the multiplication &lt;math&gt; 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 &lt;/math&gt;  Squaring something is a non-intuitive operation until you become comfortable with the graph of the function.  We can see this with the story of the of the mathematician who was offered a reward by his king.  The mathematician said he wanted a single grain of wheat, squared every day for 30 days.  For the first seven days the king's servants delivered  1, 2, 4, 16, 256, 65,536 grains of wheat to the mathematician.  On the seventh day the value was 4,294,967,296 (4 gig in computer terms)... Sometimes the story ends with the king re-negotiating, sometimes the story ends with the king executing the mathematician to preserve his kingdom, and sometimes the king is astute enough not to take the deal.

A monomial with power three is one that &quot;cubes&quot; the value of x.  This is because we use the operation x*x*x to measure the volume that a given area of x*x takes up.  If you have a cube that is 1 unit on each side and cut each side in half you will find that you have created 8 cubes.  If the mathematician had asked to have the single grain of wheat cubed than the servants would have delivered 1, 8, 512, &lt;math&gt;134 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;242 \times 10^{22}&lt;/math&gt; grains of wheat and the kings deal would have needed to be re-negotiated two days earlier.

== Polynomials ==
A '''polynomial''' of one variable, x,  is an algebraic expression that is a sum of one or more monomials.
The '''degree''' of the '''polynomial''' is the highest degree of the monomials in the sum.
An polynomial &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; can generically be expressed in the form  
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_i x^i + ... a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt; or &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}a_ix^i &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The constants a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are called the '''coefficients''' of the polynomial.  

Each of the individual monomials in the above sum, whose coefficient a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0, is called a '''term''' of the polynomial.  When i = 0, x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 and the corresponding term simply equals the constant a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.  Also when i = 1, the corresponding term equals a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x.  

A polynomial having two terms is called a '''binomial'''.  A polynomial having three terms is called a '''trinomial'''.

==Polynomial Equations==


We refer to all functions with one independent variable as &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Each instance of &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by an equation (either a monomial or a polynomial) which may have one or more places where the dependent variable is equal to zero. These places are called roots and they represent the number(s) whose value(s) for x make the function &lt;math&gt;P(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; true.  These roots are called the '''zeroes''' of the polynomial (singular is '''zero''').  A polynomial of degree 1, a monomial will always look like a line when you graph it.  Monomials always have 1 real zero.  A polynomial of degree 2, a quadratic function, can have 0, 1, or 2 real zeroes.  A polynomial of degree 3 (a cubic function) can have 1, 2, or 3 real zeroes.  A polynomial of degree 4 can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real zeroes.  In general, a polynomial of degree n, where n is odd, can have from 1 to n real zeroes.  A polynomial of degree n, where n is even, can have from 0 to n real zeroes.

When we graph polynomials each zero is a place where the polynomial crosses the x axis.  A polynomial of degree one can be generically written as &lt;math&gt;P(x)=Mx + C&lt;/math&gt; where M and C can be any real number.  We will see that quadratic functions are curves.  The curve can bend before it ever touches the X axis in which case it has no zeroes, It can bend just as it touches the X axis, in which case it can have just one zero, or it can open up above or below the X axis in which case it will have two zeroes.  If you think about this you will see that polynomials with an odd degree (1,3,5, ...) have to be positive and negative, so they have to cross the X axis at least once.  Polynomials with an even degree (2,4,6,....) might always be positive or negative and never have a zero.

Normally we represent a function in the form &lt;math&gt; P(x) = y &lt;/math&gt;, but when we are looking for the roots of the function we want y to be equal to zero so we solve for the equation of &lt;math&gt; P(x) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Solving Polynomial Equations==
Some polynomial equations can be solved by factoring, and all equations of degrees 1-4 can be solved completely by formulae. Above degree 4, there are no formulae for solving completely, and you must rely on numerical analysis or factoring. This means that for polynomials of degree greater than 4 it is often impossible to find exact solutions.

===Rational roots of polynomial equations===
Often we are interested in the rational roots of polynomials. A root is much like a factor of a number.  For instance all even numbers have a factor of two.  This means you can write the even numbers as two times another number.  That is the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 ... can be written as 2*1, 2*2, 2*3, 2*4 ... .  This fact is helpful when you have a fraction of two even numbers.  Given a fraction of two even numbers called N and M (&lt;math&gt; N / M &lt;/math&gt; you could reduce the fraction by re-writing it as &lt;math&gt; 2*n / 2*m &lt;/math&gt;.  By keeping fractions in lowest terms they its easier to know when you can add or subtract them without looking for a common denominator.

===An example of a use of a polynomial equation===

There is a story that in grade school the mathematician Gauss was asked to add the numbers 1 to 100 sequentially.  He is said to have intuited the sum could be expressed with the formula n(n+1)/2 and quickly gave the answer 5050.  The basis of this formula is that the numbers 1 through 49 added to the numbers 99 through 51 each yield 100.  It is interesting to look at how this formula works for the values 9 and 10.  For 10 we add the numbers 1+9, 2+ 8, 3+ 7, 4+ 6 to get 40 and we add the two remaining terms 5 and 10 to get 55.  For 9 we add the terms 1 + 8, 2 + 7, 3 + 6, 4+ 5 to get 4*9 = 36 + 9 = 45.  In the first case the n + 1 is the odd number and represents adding the 10 and the middle number, the 5.  In the second case the n is the odd number and the n+1 represents the sum for the preceding terms in the formula.  You may or may not find stories like this intriguing based on how your personality reacts to what is known as the [[w:Foundations_of_mathematics|foundational crisis of mathematics]].  Learning mathematics is a lot like learning a foreign language.  Some people seem more adept at learning languages than others, but with hard work learning a new language is something we can all do.

===Multiplying polynomials together ===

When we multiply polynomials together we rely heavily on the distributive property.

For instance when we multiply 67 by 5 we can divide the equation into (60 + 7)*5 = (300 + 35) = 335.  Additionally we can apply the commutative property to multiply multidigit numbers.  67*25 = (60 + 7)(20 + 5) = ((60 + 7)*20) + ((60 + 7) *5) = (60*20) + (7*20) + (60*5) + (7*5) = 1200 + 140 + 300 + 35 = 1675.  These properties are the foundation for the different forms of the mechanical calculating tool the [[w:abacus|abacus]].

When multiplying polynomials together we do similar operations.  We use the commutative property to divide the multiplier into its component parts and multiply the multiplicant by each of these parts.  For instance to multiply &lt;math&gt;x^2 + x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x  + 1&lt;/math&gt; we first write the multiplicand and multiplier in terms of powers of x.  This gives us &lt;math&gt;x^2 + x + 0x^0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + 1x^0&lt;/math&gt; The terms raised to the zero power represent constant integer terms in our equations.  Next we apply the commutative property to rewrite the equations as &lt;math&gt;[(x^2 + x + 0x^0)*1x^1] + [(x^2 + x + 0x^0)*1x^0]&lt;/math&gt;.  We simplify these equations to be &lt;math&gt;[x^3 + x^2 + 0x^1] + [x^2 + x + 0x^0]&lt;/math&gt; (notice how our integer term drops out).  Finally we combine like terms to get the answer x^3 + 2x^2 + x +0x^0.  Let's repeat that in the more familiar columnar format of multiplication:

          1x^2 + 1x^1 + 0x^0
 *               1x^1 + 1x^0
 --------------------------
          1x^2 + 1x^1 + 0x^0
 + 1x^3 + 1x^2 + 0x^1
 --------------------------
 = 1x^3 + 2x^2 + 1x^1 + 0x^0 = x^3 + 2x^2 + x


By breaking a polynomial into its r

If we have a polynomial P(x)
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_i x^i + ... a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The only possible rational roots (roots of the form p/q) are in the form

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}=\frac{\mbox{factor}\ \mbox{of}\ a_0}{\mbox{factor}\ \mbox{of}\ a_n} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://www.yahoo.com '''Yahoo! Search''']
*Purpose: &quot;Our mission is to be the most essential global Internet service for consumers and businesses.&quot; [http://docs.yahoo.com/info/values/]
*Audience: All Internet users.
*Scope: The Internet. All documents that Yahoo's web crawling software can process.
*Refresh Rate: Constant
*Other Information: It is important to differentiate between Yahoo! Search, which this page is about, and the Yahoo web site directory. Yahoo! Search is a fully automated Internet search engine. (Although it seems to incorporate a few &quot;Yahoo! Shortcuts,&quot; listed below, that may be human indexed.) On the other hand each web page in the web site directory is categorized by humans, it is not automated.

==Search Shortcuts==
Yahoo refers to the following as [http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/tips/tips-01.html Yahoo! Shortcuts]. Some have yet to be listed in this wikibook.

When typing a shortcut it looks just like a normal word search.  The difference shows up when the search results appear.  Below advertisements and above the numbered search results there will be an entry with a red Yahoo Y next to it.  This shortcut entry may provide an answer, if using the calculator or dictionary, or it may link to further pages with the answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Other Features==
Yahoo! Search also allows a number of searches which can only be done using templates on their web pages. These can be found in the advanced search. These include file format (doc, html, pdf, ppt, rss, txt, xls), search language, safesearch filter, and country.

Other features not directly impacting search results include number of results listed per page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At one time, all well-educated men (and they were almost always men) were expected to have at least a passing familiarity with Classical Greek. That age has passed, for better or worse, but many of the reasons that motivated the study of Greek are still forceful. Indeed, some of them are so common now as to seem trite and obvious: The people who used this language were the founders of Western civilization. They created bodies of thought that have profoundly affected the course of both intellectual and political history and are still influential to this day. They created and defined many of the forms that art continues to take. They laid the foundation for geometry, and invented the scientific method. To fully understand almost any area of human endeavour requires wrestling with the ancient Greeks.

Now one can do this by reading translations. Certainly innumerable Greek texts, including all the &quot;important&quot; ones, have been translated into all the major languages. But we hardly need to review the problems of translation here. It is a second-best alternative at any time, and in the case of a language two thousand years old that arose in a culture very different from our own, it sometimes seems an astonishing feat that we manage to render anything at all. It is perhaps only due to the inestimable influence of the Greeks' language and thought on our own that we manage it so well.

But by virtue of the fact that you are reading this, it's clear that you're considering an attempt at overcoming these obstacles by going directly through them, by studying Classical Greek. You may be wondering, though, is it for you?

Of course, there's no single answer to this question. If Greek is not your first foreign language, it should not present any shockingly new difficulties. It is a bit more complex in some ways than, say, Spanish or German - for example, it has nearly twenty forms of the definite article - but the principles are the same. There are verbs that must be conjugated, nouns that must be declined, and so on. The tremendous practice you gained in learning your other foreign language(s) will serve you very well in learning Greek. And as a bonus, you'll never have to worry about learning to understand native speakers: There are none!

If Greek will be your first foreign language, there are again advantages and disadvantages. Certainly the first few lessons may not be as easy as they would if you were learning, say, Spanish. And you're unlikely to find many other speakers among your friends, as you might with a modern language. But English has derived many words from Greek, and few of the principles of grammar are wildly different. Besides, if you don't know anyone else who reads Greek, you'll look all the more impressive by knowing how!

Before you begin, a word on prerequisites. This course assumes no previous foreign language knowledge. As mentioned above, learning a third or fourth language is usually easier than learning a second, but all this course presumes is English fluency.

We will try to avoid rote memorization where possible, but the fact is that memorization is impossible to avoid completely. Rules of grammar, of accent, even the alphabet itself must simply be memorized. This is not as difficult as many people seem to think, however, and the text will try to provide helps where possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already examined cases where we have a single differential equation and found several methods to aid us in finding solutions to these equations. But what happens if we have two or more differential equations that depend on each other? For example, consider the case where
: &lt;math&gt; D_t x(t) = 3y(t)^2 + x(t)t&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt; D_t y(t) = x(t) + y(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Such a set of differential equations is said to be ''coupled''. Systems of ordinary differential equations such as these are what we will look into in this section.

== First order systems ==
A general system of differential equations can be written in the form
: &lt;math&gt; D_t \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

Instead of writing the set of equations in a vector, we can write out each equation explicitly, in the form:
: &lt;math&gt; D_t x_1 = F_1(x_1, \ldots, x_n, t)&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt; \vdots\!\; &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; D_t x_i = F_i(x_1, \ldots, x_n, t)&lt;/math&gt;

If we have the system at the very beginning, we can write it as:
: &lt;math&gt; D_t \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = (x(t), y(t)) = (x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, t) = (3y^2+xt,x+y)&lt;/math&gt;
or write each equation out as shown above.

Why are these forms important? Often, this arises as a single, higher order differential equation that is changed into a simpler form in a system. For example, with the same example, 
: &lt;math&gt; D_t x(t) = 3y(t)^2 + x(t)t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; D_t y(t) = x(t) + y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

we can write this as a higher order differential equation by simple substitution. 
: &lt;math&gt; D_t y(t) - y(t) = x(t)&lt;/math&gt;
then
: &lt;math&gt; D_t x(t) = 3y(t)^2 + (D_t y(t) - y(t))t &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt; D_t x(t) = 3y(t)^2 + t D_t y(t) - t y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice now that the vector form of the system is dependent on ''t'' since
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}, t) = (3y^2+xt,x+y)&lt;/math&gt;
the first component is dependent on ''t''. However, if instead we had 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x}) = (3y^2+x,x+y)&lt;/math&gt;
notice the vector field is no longer dependent on ''t''. We call such systems ''autonomous''. They appear in the form
: &lt;math&gt; D_t \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
We can convert between an autonomous system and a non-autonomous one by simply making a substitution that involves ''t'', such as '''''y'''''=('''''x''''', t), to get a system:
: &lt;math&gt; D_t \mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{y}), 1) = (\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t), 1)&lt;/math&gt;

In vector form, we may be able to separate '''''F''''' in a linear fashion to get something that looks like:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}, t) = A(t)\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''(''t'') is a matrix and '''''b''''' is a vector. The matrix could contain functions or constants, clearly, depending on whether the matrix depends on ''t'' or not.

==Sharing component identification==

Is there any kind of standard for sharing pages between books?  In electronics we have [[Electronics/Component Identification]], which would be useful for robotics too, for part cannibalizing.  Ideally it should contain a description of every type of labeling system for every package style for every type of component, but obviously does not come close yet.  - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 03:46, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)


Not sure about that. I used external links in &quot;Robotics: Components: Actuation Devices: Motors&quot;. If there is a better way, this should be changed. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 13:41, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is great variety within the set of searches that authors may include in this book. While the difference between the searches is self evident to some, it is not to others. For this reason, the types of searches are explained below.

==Types Explained==
===Internet search engine===
*[[../Internet search engine list|Examples]]

An Internet search engine is a program designed to help you access files stored on a public server on the Internet. The search engine allows you to ask for media content meeting specific criteria (typically those which contain a given word or phrase) and retrieve a list of files that match those criteria.  Data collection is automated and done by software often known as a Web crawler.

Web search engines work by storing information about a large number of web pages, which they retrieve from the WWW itself. These pages are retrieved by a web crawler -- an automated web browser which follows every link it sees. The contents of each page are then analyzed to determine how it should be indexed (for example, words are extracted from the titles, headings, or special fields called meta tags). Data about web pages is stored in an index database for use in later queries. Some search engines, such as Google, store all or part of the source page (referred to as a cache) as well as information about the web pages.

When a user comes to the search engine and makes a query, typically by giving key words, the engine looks up the index and provides a listing of best-matching web pages according to its criteria, usually with a short summary containing the document's title and sometimes parts of the text.

The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the results it gives back. While there may be millions of Web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. Most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the &quot;best&quot; results first. How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches, and what order the results should be shown in, varies widely from one engine to another. The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve.

Most Web search engines are commercial ventures supported by advertising revenue and, as a result, some employ the controversial practice of allowing advertisers to pay money to have their listings ranked higher in search results.

===Indexing/abstracting journal database===
*[[../Journal database list|Examples]]

Indexing and abstracting databases developed as an electronic alternative to paper periodical indexes. Historically libraries provided catalogs to help find journals, magazines, and newspapers by title but they rarely catalogued the articles in each issue. Indexing and abstracting books and databases fill in this gap. One can search electronic indexes by at least article author, article title, and article subject. Most indexes have many more ways to access articles.

Indexing and abstracting databases always contain indexed article information, sometimes contain abstracts, and rarely contain the full text of articles.  In the age of the Internet and Google, using a database that doesn't have full text may seem antiquated but much of scholarly research still relies on such databases.

The addition of article subject headings in indexes is done by humans (as opposed to automated computer programs) and from this addition come positive and negative affects. Adding subject headings requires trained people and such people have to be payed therefore, driving the cost of the index higher. On the other hand, being able to find similar articles by subject can save a great amount of time.

===Citation index===
*[[../Citation index list|Examples]]

A citation index keeps track of which articles in scientific journals cite which other articles. This allows one person who wrote an article to find out how many people have cited their article.

===Library Catalog===
*[[../Library catalog|Examples]]

&quot;A library catalog is a register of all bibliographic items found in a library.&quot; A bibliographic item can be a book, video, portrait or about anything else that is considered library material.

==Which type to use: Compare and Contrast==

Much of the search engine section was originally copied from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine search engine article] from Wikipedia.

The first sentence of the library catalog section was quoted from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog the library catalog article] in Wikipedia.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Alternate picking is an important skill, because it allows you to play more than twice as fast than with just down picking. The basic idea is that if you are picking just on down strokes, every time you bring the pick back up to stroke down again, you are missing an opportunity to hit the string again. Essentially alternate picking is more efficient, because you have to move you hand less distance to hit the next note, and it can be an important difference between hitting the note on time or struggling to reach it.

As with other guitar skills, it doesn't sound even a little difficult until you actually try and do it. It will take some time to master it and get really fast.  After doing it for a long time, you will begin to notice that you are subconsciously deciding whether to alternate pick or not, depending on the underlying rhythm. Ultimately alternate picking allows you to play more efficiently, and thus faster.

Hold the pick in whichever method feels best for you. Only the top of your pick should be seen and touch the string, because when you pick you cover less distance and use less energy. Your movement should only come from your wrist, not from your whole arm, and it should be precise. There are lots of ways to practice alternate picking, but really it is something that you have to merge into all of your guitar playing. Being able to alternate pick at the right time is a very important step, and it is one of the barriers that separate good guitar players and people who just play guitar.

==Lesson 1==
To introduce yourself to alternate picking, start with a simple exercise beginning on the low E string.
&lt;pre&gt;
e|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------1--2--3--4---------------|
B|--------------------------------------------------------------1--2--3--4------------------------------| 
G|-----------------------------------------------1--2--3--4---------------------------------------------| 
D|--------------------------------1--2--3--4------------------------------------------------------------| 
A|--------------1--2--3--4------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
E|-1--2--3--4-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


e|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
B|-4--3--2--1-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
G|----------------4--3--2--1----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
D|--------------------------------4--3--2--1------------------------------------------------------------|
A|-----------------------------------------------4--3--2--1---------------------------------------------|
E|--------------------------------------------------------------4--3--2--1--2--3--4--5------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

Play this pattern up and down the strings, and then up and down the whole neck. When you hit each note, you should make sure that you are always picking in the opposite direction of the previous note. Try playing faster, but always make sure you are fretting and picking each note clean to develop good habits. A metronome is a good item to help you with these sorts of exercises, because it helps you keep a steady pace. Always spend time practicing at your maximum speed, but not for the whole time; playing at an even pace is more important and builds your internal sense of rhythm.

Once you are comfortable alternate picking, try fingering some chords and pick through them, using alternate picking where appropriate. You can stumble onto some famous songs completely by accident like this.

==Lesson 2==
This pattern is a little more complicated, as it is a walk, where you play a repeating pattern that always starts on the next highest note.
&lt;pre&gt;
e|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
B|------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
G|------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
D|-----------------------------------------1-------1-2-----1-2-3---1-2-3-4------| 
A|---------1-------1-2-----1-2-3---1-2-3-4---2-3-4-----3-4-------4--------------| 
E|-1-2-3-4---2-3-4-----3-4-------4----------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;

Continue the pattern up the strings, and make sure you are always alternate picking. You will start to notice when sometimes it is better to pick up or down twice in order to make the picking more efficient overall.

==Lesson 3==
This riff combines [[Guitar/Muting and Raking|palm muting]] and alternate picking.
&lt;pre&gt;
e|--------------------------------------------------------------------| 
B|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
G|-------------2---------------2---------------2---------------2--3---| 
D|-------------2---------------2---------------2---------------2--3---| 
A|-0-0-0-0-0-0-----0-0-0-0-0-0-----0-0-0-0-0-0-----0-0-0-0-0-0--------|
E|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
&lt;/pre&gt;
The open notes should be muted, and you should be using alternate picking. This riff is very similar to a riff from Metallica's One.

==Additional Lessons==
If you want more exercises, please see other sections of this book, and perform the exercises there, except add in the alternate picking. Alternatively, you could take a song you already know, and then pick the chords using alternate picking. You will soon see how you can apply alternate picking into every part of your guitar playing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is &quot;East Asian Orthography&quot;? Isn't it just those symbols you see in Chinatown or Koreatown, or in anime or manga? Really, East Asian writing is a lot more complex than that, and it is important to know what you're dealing with before you learn how to write an East Asian language.

By East Asian writing, we are really talking about the set of writing used by the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. But these languages use very different writing systems.

'''Chinese''', for example, uses Chinese characters or '''logographs''', where each symbol represents a word or a word root (called &quot;morphemes&quot;), with one (or several) defined meanings and pronunciations. If English were written this way, for example, we would have individual symbols for simple words like &quot;the&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;moon&quot;, etc. and a series of symbols for more complex words like &quot;understand&quot; and &quot;approve&quot;, with one symbol for each part of the word. (For example, &quot;understand&quot; may be composed of two symbols, one for &quot;under&quot; and one for &quot;stand&quot;.)

Contrary to popular belief, Chinese characters do not in any way represent ''ideas'' or ''philosophies'' directly. It represents a language, and nothing more.

'''Japanese''', on the other hand, uses the kana system, composed of two syllabaries, '''hiragana''' and '''katakana'''. &quot;Syllabaries&quot; are systems where one symbol represents a syllable. For example, &quot;ka&quot; is a syllable, and hence in Japanese it is written with a single hiragana letter or a single katakana letter. Same with, say, &quot;ki&quot;, which is written with another hiragana letter or a katakana letter. Hiragana developed out of stylized cursive Chinese characters, and katakana developed out of parts taken from Chinese characters. Chinese characters, known in Japanese as '''kanji''', are also used in the Japanese language to write both Chinese loanwords and native Japanese words.

'''Korean''' uses '''hangul''', which is an alphabet just like the English one, with one letter for each discrete sound. Although Korean letters were originally invented as abstract, geometrical shapes, their stroke forms are nevertheless usually written just like those used in Chinese characters. In addition, Korean letters are arranged into square blocks by syllable, again, making Korean writing look similar to Chinese. Chinese characters, known in Korean as '''hanja''', are also used to an extent in South Korea. In North Korea, hanja have been completely abolished.

Hence, '''East Asian orthography''' is really a set of three very different writing systems: Chinese characters, with one symbol for each word root; Japanese kana, with one symbol for each syllable; and Korean hangul, with one symbol for each discrete sound.

Despite their functional differences, however, East Asian writing systems stem from a common ancient Chinese root. By and large, they are written with the same strokes, use the same stroke order, and achieve the same general aesthetic effect. Moreover, Chinese characters are widely used in all three languages, and a thorough study of any one of the three languages would certainly entail a thorough study of Chinese characters.

This textbook will, therefore, attempt to cover topics of East Asian orthography that are common to all three systems, namely, the aesthetic aspects of East Asian writing. With these aesthetic considerations in mind, it will be possible for you avoid common pitfalls of beginners, whose writing (be it in Chinese characters, Japanese kana, or Korean hangul) often end up looking misshapen and askew.

On the other hand, this course will not focus on the functional aspects of the three different systems, which are, of course, all very different. That is the job of the individual language textbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Chinese writing system can be traced back to the oracle bones of more than 4000 years ago, found in the ruins of the Shang dynasty, the first literate dynasty of China. The writing found on the oracle bones, known collectively as the '''Oracle Script''', were mostly for divination purposes. Later on during the next dynasty (the Zhou), more types of writing appeared: on bronzeware vessels, on silk, on bamboo scrolls. It was in the early Chinese writing system of this period that great philosophers such as Confucius, Mencius, and Lao-tze recorded their thoughts and beliefs.

In 221 BC, the Qin state of northwestern China brought the country under a unified bureaucratic empire, for the first time in Chinese history. The Qin set out to unify Chinese culture as well; they standardized and simplified the Chinese system into a common script, known today as the '''Seal Script''', due to the primary use of their script today: on seals.

The Qin Dynasty was short and lasted only 15 years. They were replaced by the Han Dynasty, who pushed China into a golden age just as Rome on the other side of the world heralded the golden age of Mediterranean Antiquity. The Han Dynasty would forever lend their name to the Chinese people; even today ethnic Chinese around the world call themselves Han and their writing system '''Han'''zi (which passed into Japanese as '''Kan'''ji and Korean as '''Han'''ja). In addition, the Han Dynasty saw the further development of the Chinese script into the '''Clerk Script'''. This script is used today primarily for stylistic purposes.

As the Han Dynasty ended and China spun into several centuries of chaos and disunity, new writing styles emerged, including the super-cursive '''Grass Script''', the moderately-cursive '''Running Script''', and the neat, squarish '''Regular Script'''. The Regular Script is now the standard writing script of Chinese. It was also during this period that Chinese writing passed to Japan. The Grass Script and the Regular Script became, respectively, the foundations for Japanese '''hiragana''' and '''katakana'''.

The next major development came in Korea, where in 1446, the ''Hunmin Jeongeum'' was published under the reign of King Sejong. In this document, a newly invented alphabet for Korean, '''Hangul''', was presented. Hangul is the only major alphabet in the world designed explicitly with phonological principles in mind, that having been studied for centuries by scholars of Sanskrit and Classical Chinese. Originally Hangul was intended to be supplementary to Hanja; but the 19th and 20th centuries saw its rise to become the dominant script of the Korean language.

The 20th century saw another important development: the simplification of Chinese characters. After taking over mainland China in 1949, the Chinese communists sought to eradicate illiteracy, especially in the countryside. To do this, they undertook a campaign to simplify the shapes of a large number of Chinese characters. The reformed characters, known as '''Simplified Chinese''', have been universally adopted by both mainland China and Singapore. On the other hand, there are plenty of people as well who believe that the reform has bastardized the Chinese writing system and does little to combat illiteracy. The traditional characters, known as '''Traditional Chinese''', are still in use in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau, as well as many Chinese communities around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The dot stroke is the simplest stroke in East Asian writing systems. Despite its name, it is ''not'' just a dot &amp;mdash; it has length (sometimes quite long), and direction. In fact, it is the shape of this stroke, and not its length, that makes it a dot stroke.

Examples of the dot stroke:
{| border
|'''C'''hinese characters || the first and fourth strokes of 六 &lt;br&gt; the first, third, and fourth strokes of 心 &lt;br&gt; the first and second strokes of the water radical: 江、河、法 &lt;br&gt; the first and second strokes of the heart radical: 忙、性、快 &lt;br&gt; the first stroke of the walking radical: 送、道、遇 &lt;br&gt; and so on
|-
|'''J'''apanese kana &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || Katakana: シ、ス、ソ、タ、ツ、ト、ヌ、ネ、ハ、ホ、マ、ミ、ム、メ、ン
|-
|'''K'''orean jamo &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅉ
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It's harder to determine what a stroke is in hiragana, since hiragana is inherently cursive. Dot-like shapes can be found in い、う、え、お、か、く、な、ふ、へ、む、や、ら.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Korean jamo tend to be freer in stroke specification, sometimes ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅉ can end on a vertical stroke or a right falling stroke as well.&lt;/small&gt;

If dot strokes can come in so many shapes or sizes, then what makes a &quot;dot&quot;?

In general, a dot stroke is defined by the following properties:

# They go downward.
#* Most dot strokes go diagonally downwards and rightwards. A few go leftwards, or straight down.
# They start soft and end hard.
#* Dot strokes don't trail off. The instant before you lift your pencil / pen off the paper should be one where you're applying force onto the paper.
# They tend to curve down.
#* This is mostly a consequence of the second point above. As you apply more and more force you tend to draw your hand closer to your body, hence curving the stroke downwards.
#* However, please don't overdo this. This feature should be a natural result of point 2 above. If you find yourself curving the stroke deliberately, then you're probably overdoing it. If it doesn't curve, then leave it. Not all dot strokes need to curve.

Let's take a look at three examples, the Chinese character for &quot;heart&quot;, the Japanese katakana ''mi'', and the Korean syllable for ''si'':

[[Image:CJK 1-01-01.PNG]]

The first, third and fourth strokes of &quot;heart&quot;, all of the strokes of &quot;mi&quot;, and the second stroke of &quot;si&quot; all show the properties of dot strokes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Current revision of the '''Table of Contents''' to the '''Science of Getting Rich''' adds this new statement:

''&quot;The Science of Getting Rich&quot; provides an unusual method for gaining wealth: It preaches against competitive economic practices, instead concerning itself with the betterment of the world.''

This makes competitive economic practices and world betterment seem mutually exclusive. They are not. Competitive economics betters the world a great deal. The computer in front of you is a great example of world betterment resulting from competitive economics.

While the book's author might agree with the statement, many modern economists would not.

Also see recipes for [[Cookbook:Twice-Baked Potatoes|Twice-Baked Potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Twice-Baked Potatoes II|Twice-Baked Potatoes II]].

== Ingredients ==
*6 medium-size baking [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or leftover cooked potatoes
*¾ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*4 oz. [[Cookbook:Velveeta|Velveeta]], chopped into chunks
*4 oz. [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar cheese]], chopped into chunks
*2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]]
*1 Tbsp. dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] flakes

== Procedure ==
# If you are using leftover baked potatoes, skip baking instructions. To use leftover boiled potatoes, bake for 10 minutes in a 400º oven to brown skins.
# Wash potatoes, prick all over with a fork, then bake until done. You can bake for about 45 minutes in a 400º oven if you prefer, or microwave on high for 6 minutes, then bake for 10 minutes in a 400º oven to brown skins. Let cool until they can be handled, or use hot pads and be careful. 
# Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and carefully scoop out the insides. Put the potato skins in a baking dish (any kind will work as long as it is big enough to fit all of them). Put the insides into a bowl (if you want to use a microwave) or a saucepan to make the filling on the stove.
# Mash potatoes. (The back of a spoon is sufficient here; most lumps will disappear as the filling is stirred.) Add all other ingredients and stir. If you are using the stove, turn to medium low and keep stirring until cheese is melted and potatoes are smooth. If potatoes are still slightly crunchy, turn heat up to medium until they are soft. To use microwave, heat the filling on high for 1 minute at a time, stirring between each heating period, until filling is smooth. If mixture is too thick to stir easily, add extra milk or water.
# Distribute the filling among the potato shells, then bake in a 400º oven until tops are browned (about 15 minutes).

== Variations ==
*Add 1/4 cup crumbled bacon to filling.
*Add 1/4 cup chopped ham to filling.
*Sprinkle grated cheese or fresh chives on top of each potato before final baking.
*Pipe filling through a large decorating tip for a fancier look.

When an idea, suggestion or thought is offered to a group and is criticized, changed, or adapted, it's human to feel personally attacked. It hurts--sometimes a lot. 

Try to remember, it is the idea or concept which is being criticized, not you personally. Once an idea is offered here, it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to the group to do whatever develops from the discussion. Chances are, you have not, nor shall you ever meet the other participants, yet, through this process, every participant has the opportunity to make meaningful contributions.

Realizing the idea or concept no longer belongs to you, once offered, makes it easier to divorce yourself from the idea and helps you understand the group's criticism or changes have nothing to do with your worth as a human.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm just in the process of fleshing out the contents... please feel free to dig in and add whatever you always wanted to see in a manual.

I suggest you check here: [[Electronics]]

Yup, I did...great stuff! Building links to it should be great fun. However, electronics is only part of ham radio so there is a lot of work to do yet. Things have been on hold for bathroom renovations...don't you hate it when real world stuff interferes with your hobbies?

MATERIAL TO INTEGRATE can be found at http://wikisource.org/wiki/Solomon_Isles_Amateur_Radio_Course
This is originally from rtf format, but most of the formatting is wrong. If you are keen enough you can get it emailed to you in 16 pages, 1.5 Mb.

== I suggest starting with all material on one page. ==

Instead of creating a main page with a bunch of links, why not just keep all content on one page at first.  Then if/when we get to the 50kb size, then start subdividing.  I can help with porting all the child pages back to the main page if that's the direction the group wants to take.

== Specificity ==

I think that many of the chapter headings are too specific.  Many of the topics can be combined fairly easily and doing so might group related and fundamental information.  In particular, information on voltage, current and atoms could be put together and perhaps clarify the information.  This will help give somewhat longer chapters.  I will write a combined page

== Table of transmission fequencies is irrelevant ==

The page http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Amateur_Radio_Manual/Table_of_transmission_frequencies contains long lists of broadcast transmitters in Europe, all irrelevant to Amateur Radio so I'd like to propose removing it from this book. [[User:Dodger67|Dodger67]] 10:46, 30 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Welcome to the course ==
Welcome to a course in Swedish. When you have completed this course, you should have enough knowledge to speak, read and write the language rather well. In order to learn a language properly, you must take action, you must ''do'' something. So I suggest, after you've learnt the basics, that you look up some simple, easy Swedish literature, and start reading. &lt;!-- Link to nice, easy articles/text here later --&gt; Knowing what is easy is not easy if you don't know any Swedish at all though. If you know somebody who is Swedish, they might be able to help you to some nice reading. I will also try to put up some links to nice, easy articles here later.

== General remarks about Swedish ==
While Swedish is, like most European languages, not very closely related in how it is written and how it is pronounced, it is more so than English or French. Swedish, like English, also counts a fair number of dialects, including the southern ''scanian'' which resembles Danish, the Finnish-Swedish dialect of Swedish-speaking Finns, and several dialects different enough to be considered separate languages, although not recognized as such legally or in administration.

There are nine vowels in Swedish:

{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.5em;&quot; valign=top
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| a
| e
| i
| o
| u
| y
| å
| ä
| ö
|}

and 19 consonants:
{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.5em;&quot; valign=top
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| b
| c
| d
| f
| g
| h
| j
| k
| l
| m
| n
| p
| q
| r
| s
| t
| v
| x
| z
|}

The consonants '''c''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''' and '''z''' appear mostly in words of foreign origin. '''à''', '''é''' and '''ü''' are considered variants of '''a''', '''e''' and '''y''' respectively. The combination '''kk''' is always written as '''ck''' in Swedish words.

&lt;!-- Diphtongs TBD --&gt;

== Syllable division ==
Syllable division marks the natural break in a word. When you know where the syllables divide, you can divide a word into its natural sections. This makes speaking correctly easier. You also get a correct speech rhythm. The general rule for syllable division is that each syllable contains one vowel each.

&lt;!-- syllable breaks TBD
=== Before one consonant ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| en ta-le
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a speech'''
|-
| å so-ve
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''to sleep''
|-
| en sa-me
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a sami''
|}

=== Between two consontants ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| ei jen-te
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a girl'''
|-
| å san-ke

| ''to gather''
|-
| et styk-ke
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a piece''
|}

=== Between two vowels that do not form a diphthong ===

{| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
| en bo-a
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

|-

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a radio''
|-
| en ge-o-graf
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a geographer''
|-
| et pi-a-no
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a piano''
|-
| en ko-a-la
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a koala''
|}
--&gt;

== Information about the language ==
First of all - Swedish is a North Germanic language, which is a subgroup of the Germanic Languages, containing languages as: Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and Faroese, as well as Norn, which is extinct. Swedish is considered mutually intelligible to a great extent with Norwegian and to some extent with Danish - and native speakers of these languages often intercommunicate. Also since Swedish is a Germanic Language speakers of Western Germanic Languages - e.g. English and German - shouldn't find Swedish that hard to learn, since these languages share some common traits. Swedish is also one of the official languages of Finland. 

=== Alphabet ===
The Swedish alphabet is almost the same as in English, except for three additional letters, å/Å, ä/Ä and ö/Ö. These have no special function in sentences/words, they are normal letters, and you will see them in use nearly as much as any other letters would be in use in English.

Here's how to say the alphabet letter by letter:
{| width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
|

== The pitfalls ==
A few general things to be aware of, as most beginners find them hard,

=== Sje- and tje- ===
Two quite similar consonant sounds frequently baffle beginners in Swedish. They are the ''sje-'' and ''tje-'' sounds. To someone who knows English, they are the sounds present in '''''sh'''ear'' and '''''ch'''ain'', respectively. The hard part is their spelling, which varies a lot.

=== Speaking at the tip of your tongue ===
Swedish does very rarely involve making sounds at the back of your mouth. Vowels should be formed &quot;near your front teeth&quot;. ''&quot;L&quot;'' and ''&quot;T&quot;'' are not thick as in English, and ''&quot;R&quot;'' always rolls.

=== Noun gender ===
Even native Swedes cannot explain noun gender - there isn't any. Yet, it must be followed. The simple answer is you have to learn it for each noun. 

== Getting Started ==
Okay, if you're ready, all you have to do is proceed to [[Swedish/Lesson 1|Lesson 1]]!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spanish has six different type of pronouns, the 1./2./3. person
singular and the 1./2./3. person plural:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
|1.&amp;nbsp;singular || yo || I || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
|2.&amp;nbsp;singular 
| [[Spanish/Tú-usted|tú]]
| you (one person, informal) 
| [[Spanish/Tú-usted|usted]]
| you (one person, formal) || &amp;nbsp;|| &amp;nbsp;
|-
|3.&amp;nbsp;singular || él|| he, it || ella || she, it|| &amp;nbsp;|| &amp;nbsp;
|-
|1.&amp;nbsp;plural || nosotros || we (at least one male) || nosotras || we (only females) || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|-
|2.&amp;nbsp;plural 
| vosotros 
| you (several persons, at least one male, informal, only used in Spain) 
| vosotras 
| you (several persons, only females, informal, only used in Spain) 
| ustedes 
| you (several persons; in Spain it's formal, in Latin America ''ustedes'' is the only pronoun of second person plural).
|-
|3.&amp;nbsp;plural || ellos || they (at least one male) || ellas || they (only female) || &amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;
|}

* It is normal in Spanish to omit the personal pronoun (i.e. you seldom say '''yo estoy bien''' but '''estoy bien''', and you ask '''¿Cómo se llama?''' instead of '''¿Cómo se llama usted?''') because the specific conjugation of a verb usually indicates which person is the subject. However, usted, él and ella all use the same verb form so if you choose to drop the pronoun in this case it must be clear in the situational context which pronoun is being referenced.
* As indicated above, in most of Spain the '''[[Spanish/Tú-usted|vosotros]]''' form can be used to address a group of familiar people (e.g. friends), and '''ustedes''' is used with more formality (e.g. recent acquaintances). In all Latin American countries and parts of Spain '''[[Spanish/Tú-usted|ustedes]]''' is used also for a familiar group of people; in these countries the &quot;vosotros&quot; form is almost never used.

      <comment>/* Gender of non sexed nouns */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In English, the verb in a sentence changes depending on if the noun is singular or plural.  For example, it would be grammatically wrong to write &quot;We is here&quot;, since ''we'' is plural but ''is'' is the singular form of the verb.  We need to keep track of which words are singular and which are plural, but since we learn that when we learn the word, it isn't too difficult.

In Spanish, we also need to keep track of another attribute, called the gender.
Spanish has two grammatical genders, which are known as &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot;.  Just like a word can be singular or plural, it can also be masculine or feminine. Sometimes it is obvious which gender a word is, such as the words for ''man'' and ''woman''.  Other times, it may seem arbitrary.  Just learn the gender of each noun you learn, and you won't have too much trouble.

==Gender of sexed nouns==
Normally, for nouns that express entities with sex (people or animals) there is both a masculine-gender form and a feminine-gender form (example: '''el profesor''' (m), '''la profesora''' (f)). 
Normally, the feminine-gender words end with the letter 'a' and the masculine words end with the letter 'o'. If a masculine word ends with a consonant, the feminine adds 'a'. If word ends in 'a' it can be both masculine and feminine ''(el artista, la artista).''

Examples:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
| el niño || the boy, the child
| la niña || the girl     
|-
| el amigo || the friend     
| la amiga || the female friend    
|-
| el gato || the cat || la gata || the female cat
|-
| el doctor || the doctor      
| la doctora || the female doctor    
|-
| el artista || the artist     
| la artista || the female artist  
|}

Sex is not correctly expressed by the gender alone. If you want to say &quot;I need a female student&quot; you can say '''Necesito una alumna'''. However, since gender is required but doesn't convey additional meaning, the sentence would be better understood if you say '''Necesito una alumna mujer'''.

In the plural the masculine-gender form indicates there is at least one male, or that sex is unknown. '''Los niños''' is ''the children''. To indicate boys you must say '''los niños varones''' or '''los niños hombres''' ''(the male children)''.

See also [[../Formation of the feminine in nouns/|Formation of the feminine]]

==Gender of non sexed nouns==
Many words in Spanish have a fixed arbitrary gender, which is also called gramatical gender. This is true for all things: '''el pan''' ''(bread)'', '''la leche''' ''(milk).'' Most animals follow this rule: el camello ''(camel),'' la jirafa ''(giraffe).'' There are a few words applied to persons that have grammatical gender: el personaje ''(personage, character)'', la visita ''(visitor)''.

Normally, the feminine-gender words finalize with the letter 'a' and the masculine-gender words end with the letter 'o'. 

'''Examples''': 

Masculine-gender words ending in '''o''': 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
| el camello || ''camel''    
|-
| el cerro || ''hill''     
|-
| el libro || ''book''     
|}

Feminine-gender words ending in '''a''': 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
| la paloma || ''dove''     
|-
| la hierba || ''grass''    
|-
| la casa || ''house''    
|}

Here the endings that are typical for feminine nouns. 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || Exceptions
|-
|'''-a''' || la casa ''(house)'' || el mapa ''(map)''
|-
|'''-ad''' || la verdad ''(truth)'' || &amp;nbsp;
|-
|'''-ud''' || la salud ''(health)'' || el alud  ''(avalanche)''
|-
|'''-ez''' || la pesadez ''(heaviness)'', la pez ''( tar)'' || el pez ''(fish)''
|-
|'''-ión''' || la nación ''(nation)'' || el camión  ''(truck)''
|-
|'''-is''' || la tesis ''(thesis)'' || el frontis ''(facade)''
|-
|'''-umbre''' || la legumbre ''(vegetable)'' || el alumbre ''(alum)''
|}

A mnemonic rule for most feminine-gender endings is the &quot;word&quot; ''D-ión-Z-A.''

There is also a (much less strict) rule for typical masculine-gender endings. The endings can be summarized easily by the word ''L-O-N-E-R-S'':

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
|&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp; || Exceptions
|-
|'''-l''' || el árbol ''(tree)'' || la miel ''(honey)''
|-
|'''-o'''  || el pelo ''(hair)'' || la mano ''(hand)''
|-
|'''-n''' (minus '''-ión''') || el cinturón ''(belt)'' 
| la sartén ''(frying pan)''; however, many people say ''el sartén''
|-
|'''-e'''  || el volante ''(steering wheel)'' || la muerte ''(death)'', la base ''(basis)''
|-
|'''-r'''  || el olor ''(smell, odor)'' || la flor ''(flower)''
|-
|'''-s''' (minus '''-is''') || el virus ''(virus)'' || &amp;nbsp;
|-
|stressed vowel || el sofá ''(sofa)'' || la mamá ''(mother, mom)''
&lt;/table&gt;

Since there are many exceptions to some of the rules it is always good to learn the gender along with the noun. Definite articles normally help us to do this.

Some of these exceptions can be memorized in groups. For example, although most nouns that end in &quot;-a&quot; are feminine and therefore take the &quot;la&quot; article, many nouns that end in ''-ma'' are exceptions to the rule and are masculine. This is because these words have a Greek origin. For example, ''el tema, el programa, el fantasma, el clima'' and ''el diploma.'' However, many words ending in ''-ma'' have a feminine gender: ''la cama, la broma, la norma, la rama, la fama, la yema, la estima, la espuma.''

==Pronunciation drill 1A-1-P==

Listen to the following audio files and repeat what the speaker says in the pauses.

#{{knop|hoegaathetmetje}} - Hoe gaat het met je?
#:Notice how &quot;met&quot; and &quot;je&quot; 'meld' together. This is very common in casual speech.
#{{knop|metmijgaathetprimadankje}} - Met mij gaat het prima, dank je!
#:Notice the use of the full pronoun 'mij', because emphasis is put on it. That's why the sentence starts with it. This in turn switches the words &quot;het&quot; and &quot;gaat&quot; into inverse order, much like in the question above.
#{{knop|ikmoetnugaantotziens}} Ik moet nu gaan, tot ziens!
#:Did you notice how the ''z'' of '''''z'''iens'' assimilates from [z] to [s] once it is put behind the -t of to''t''?. This happens a lot to voiced consonants in initial position. All ''final'' obstruents are voiceless automatically and they even infect the next word!
#: If you are American pay attention to the [u] sound in m''oe''t, it is quite a bit more rounded than Americans pronounce a 'u' sound.

|}
We saw that Dutch makes a distinction between jij/je and u and that this has to do with formality and politeness. The same applies to the formulas used to say thank you and please.

Please is ''alsjeblieft'' or ''alstublieft''. Both literally mean: &quot;if it pleases you&quot;: ''als het je/u belieft''. It is used in a somewhat different way than in English as it can be used both to say &quot;May I please have...&quot;: ''mag ik alstublieft ... hebben'', or for the answer &quot;Here you are&quot;, &quot;Here it is&quot; as the waiter in the above dialogue. Alsjeblieft is commonly abbreviated to ''ajb'', whereas alstublieft is abbreviated to ''a.u.b.''.

&quot;Thank you&quot; can either be ''dank je'' or ''dank u''. It is sometimes augmented with -wel: ''dank je wel'', ''dank u wel''. 

An even more informal way of thanking is to say ''bedankt'' &quot;(you are) thanked&quot;. It is mostly used in the negative: &quot;nee, bedankt&quot; and can even sound a little abbrasive, as in ''thanks, but no thanks''.

A formal alternative is ''hartelijk dank'' &quot;Cordially (I say) thanks&quot;

The equivalent of &quot;you are welcome&quot; is ''tot je dienst'' or ''tot uw dienst'' &quot;at your service&quot;. An alternative is ''graag gedaan'' &quot;done with pleasure&quot; or ''niets te danken'' &quot;(there is) nothing to thank for&quot;. Expression like these are not used nearly much as their English counterpart, although this strongly depends on the region. Particularly in the northernmost provinces of the Netherlands (Groningen, Friesland e.g.) people tend to economize on politeness expressions, even find them annoying. Being direct is considered polite enough.

==Pronunciation drills 1A-2-P==

#{{knop|wiltuietseten}} - Wilt u iets eten? - Would you like something to eat
#:Did you notice the /w/? It is produced ''not'' between the upper and lower lips as in English or French, but between the upper '''teeth''' and the lower lips. At least in the Netherlands it is. In Flanders and in Surinam a bilabial w is more common, so it is not a disaster if you do that one wrong.
#{{knop|magikalstubliefteenkopjekoffie}} - Mag ik alstublieft een kopje koffie - May I have a cup of coffee, please.
#:Notice that the 'k' sound is without aspiration: not khopje khoffie; it also contains an u-sound and one gutteral spirant. Try to make those light. Often newbies try to show off their gutterals very emphatically. It makes them sound, well, ehm, gutteral? In the bad sense of the word. Dutch speakers only do that when they are mad at someone. Otherwise they are pretty light.
#{{knop|jagraagikwilgraageenpannenkoek}} - Ja graag! Ik wil graag een pannenkoek
#:Of course the latter will test your abilities to produce gutturals... They are quite numerous in Dutch, so that you do need to practise them. As the /r/ is concerned, this speaker still uses the oldfashioned rrolling one, but today (2009) there are many different varieties being used, producing interesting combinations if preceded or followed by a g or ch.

{{mergeto|How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC}}

''NOTE:- This book is currently in the process of being merged. Some data could be out of place or already merged.''
Personal Computers (PCs) can be obtained in desktop, laptop, notebook and other portable formats.

They are used in all areas of society.

This module describes the parts of typical desktop personal computers.

''please add your contributions''

----

''Note: Should this stuff be moved to other pages?''

Here is how : [[Help:Editing]]

=Computer hardware=

* The [[Wikipedia:Motherboard|Motherboard]] and things directly attached to it. 
* Computer [[w:chassis|chassis]] and [[w:screen|screen]], preferly with standard sizes (i.e. [[w:ISO A4|ISO A4]] for notebook chassis).
* [[w:Storage media|Storage media]]
* Other peripherals

---

=Class 1 Components=
Class 1 components are integral to the function of the computer.

&lt;!--
Where did this &quot;Class 1&quot;, &quot;Class 2&quot; terminology come from ?
--&gt;

== CPU ==

&lt;!--
Some people prefer a &quot;heart&quot; analogy -- the CPU pumps the data from one place to another.
--&gt;
The CPU ([[w:Central Processing Unit|Central Processing Unit]]) is the 'brain' of the computer.

It's typically a square ceramic package plugged into the motherboard, with a large heat sink on top (and often a fan on top of that heat sink).

All instructions the computer will process are processed by the CPU.
There are many &quot;CPU architectures&quot;, each of which has its own characteristics and trade-offs.
The dominant CPU architectures used in personal computing are [[wikipedia:X86|x86]] and [[wikipedia:PowerPC|PowerPC]].
x86 is easily the most popular processor for this class of machine (the dominant manufacturers of x86 CPUs are [[wikipedia:Intel|Intel]] and [[wikipedia:AMD|AMD]]).
X64 is currently replacing X86 as it has superior performance. X86 is 32 bit that means it has 6 0s and 1s to use at one instance while X64 can use 7 0s and 1s. Some programs are offered in 64-bit only.

The other architectures are used, for instance, in workstations, servers or embedded systems
&lt;!-- I think this is going into a bit too much detail -- move back to WikiPedia:Microprocessor ?

--&gt;
CPUs contain a small amount of static RAM (SRAM) called a [[w:cache|cache]]. Some processors have two or three levels of cache, containing as much as several megabytes of memory.

'''Dual Core'''

Some of the new processors made by [[w:Intel|Intel]] and [[w:AMD|AMD]] are [[w:Dual core|Dual core]].
The Intel designation for dual core are &quot;Pentium D&quot;, &quot;Core Duo&quot; and &quot;Core 2 Duo&quot; while AMD has its &quot;X2&quot; series and &quot;FX-6x&quot;.

The core is where the data is processed and turned into commands directed at the rest of the computer.
Having two cores increases the data flow into the processor and the command flow out of the processor potentially doubling the processing power, but the increased performance is only visible with multithreaded applications and heavy multitasking.

'''Hyper Threading'''

[[w:Hyper Threading|Hyper Threading]] is a technology that uses one core but adds a virtual processor to an additional thread at the same time.

Normally the processor carries out one task and then proceeds onto the next task. But with Hyper Threading the processor continually switches in-between each task as if to do them at the same time.

&lt;!-- too much detail ?

--&gt;
&lt;!-- Add different architectures (CISC, RISC, Sparc, ARM, MIPS, etc)and more importantly for A+
what the different packages (slot, Zero insertion force, ball pin grid array , etc
--&gt;
For more information, consult the Wikipedia article on [[wikipedia:Microprocessor|microprocessors]].

== Case ==

Most modern computers have an &quot;[[Wikipedia:ATX|ATX form factor]]&quot; case in which ATX-compatible power supplies, Mainboards and Drives can be mounted.

.

&lt;!-- Form factors would be more appropriate under mainboard.
For the A+ certification the reader needs to be at least aware of different form factors ITX, the new BTX, AT, and more
--&gt;
&lt;!-- How many ITX's do you want?
--&gt;
During the 1980's and 1990's almost all cases were beige, even Apple's Macintosh line. A few rare exceptions to this were black. Only recently have computer case designers realized that there was a worthwhile market for other colors and designs. This has led to all sorts of modifications to the basic design of a computer case. Now it is easy to find cases with transparent windows and glowing lights illuminating their insides.

== Power Supply ==

All computers have some sort of [[w:power supply|power supply]]. This converts the supply voltage (AC 110 or 220[[wikipedia:Volts|V]]) to different voltages   such as [[wikipedia:Direct current|DC]] 5V, 12V and 3.3V. These are needed inside the computer system by nearly every component inside the computer.

There will be a bunch of connectors coming off of the supply, called [[w:Molex connector|Molex connector]]s. They come in varying sizes, meant for different applications, such as the motherboard (usually the largest of the connectors), the hard and optical drives (a bunch of medium-sized connectors), as well as the floppy drive (a relatively small connector, also saw usage among videocards in 2004). As newer standards come out, the types of connectors have changed. Many power supplies now come with power connectors for Serial ATA hard drives. These are smaller and are &quot;hot-swappable&quot;, meaning they can be removed and plugged in again without fear of data loss or electrical problems.

== Motherboard ==

The [[wikipedia:Motherboard|Motherboard]] (also called [[wikipedia:Mainboard|Mainboard]]) is a large, thin, flat, rectangular fiberglass board (typically green in the past but are now typically black due to consumer demands) attached to the case.
The Motherboard carries the CPU, the [[w:RAM|RAM]], the [[w:chipset|chipset]] and the [[w:expansion slot|expansion slot]]s ([[w:PCI|PCI]], [[w:AGP|AGP]] - for graphics -, ISA, etc.).
&lt;!-- Chipsets should be mentioned, northbridge, southbridge --&gt;

The Motherboard also holds things like the BIOS ([[w:Basic Input Output System|Basic Input Output System]]) and the CMOS Battery (a coin cell that keeps an embbeded RAM in the motherboard -often NVRAM- powered to keep various settings in effect).

Most modern motherboards have onboard sound and LAN controller, some of them even have on-board graphics. These are adequate for standard office work and system sounds. But dedicated sound and graphics cards plugged into the expansion slots offer much better quality and performance
     A motherboard includes many components such as CPU,RAM,FIRMWARE,INTERAL AND EXTERNAL BUSES.

== RAM ==

[[wikipedia:Random access memory|Random Access Memory (RAM)]] is a memory that the microprocessor uses to store data during processing. This memory is volatile (loses its contents at power-down). When a software application is launched, the executable program is loaded from hard drive to the RAM. The microprocessor supplies address into the RAM to read instructions and data from it. RAM is needed because hard drives are too slow to operate with the speed of a microprocessor.

Some of the types of RAM are [[w:SDRAM|SDRAM]], [[w:Static_random-access_memory|SRAM]], [[w:DDR RAM|DDR RAM]], [[w:Rambus RAM|Rambus RAM]], [[w:SIMM|SIMM]], [[w:DIMM|DIMM]].

=== External Links ===
* http://www.kingston.com/tools/umg/default.asp (Ultimate memory guide)
&lt;!-- RAM Timings and different forms DRAM (DDR-1,DDR-2,DDR-3), Rambus, SODIMM, DIMM, RIMM&gt;
&lt;!-- ==PCI-X==
&lt;!-- Don't forget input about SRAM.--&gt;

== PCI Express Cards/Slots ==

The [[w:PCI Express|PCI Express]] standard was created to replace both AGP and PCI slots, with PCI Express 16x and PCI 1x respectively for most implementations.  The current implementation of PCI Express allows up to PCI Express 32x.

The reason for the change is that the older PCI cards don't transfer data quickly enough to keep up with modern day gaming, autocad and video editing software.

Think of it this way, there is a tap that is two inches in diameter, but a drain that is only one inch in diameter. The water doesn't drain quickly enough and eventually the sink overflows. Just like a PCI video card.

== AGP Cards ==

Most [[w:graphic card|graphic card]]s produced from about 1998-2004 were AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) cards. They are placed in a certain slot on the mainboard with an extra high data transfer rate. The interface was invented to keep the graphics card away from the PCI bus, which was starting to become too constrained for modern graphics cards.

Every graphic card carries a graphic chip (GPU) and very fast DDR RAM for textures and 3D data. Their data buses have 1X, 2X, 4X, and 8X speeds. The bus is 32-bit, much like PCI.

AGP slots are slightly shorter than PCI slots and often brown in color. A similar type of slot called AGP Pro is longer and has extra power leads to accommodate modern video cards. It didn't really catch on in the mainstream market, and graphics card makers preferred to add an extra power connector to supply the power they needed.

== PCI Cards ==

The [[wikipedia:PCI|PCI]] (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus is the most popular internal interconnect for personal computers. They are usually white in color.

The specification features:

* Plug and play configuration (through standardised means for interacting with configuration software)
* Standardised electrical connections

Common PCI implementations in desktop PCs feature:

* 32-bit addressing
* 33-MHz bus clock

High-end implementations may also feature:

* 64-bit addressing
* &quot;Hot plugging&quot; (the ability to add / remove PCI devices from a running machine)
* 66-MHz bus clock

(all of these are characteristic of PCI-X)

There have been many revisions and evolutions of the PCI specification over the years.  Recently, PCI-X has sought to extend the aging architecture for the needs of modern server-class machines, avoiding some of the performance bottlenecks of previous revisions.  The new PCI Express specification seems likely to succeed PCI in all classes of personal computer within the next few years.

== ISA Cards ==

[[w:Industry Standard Architecture|Industry Standard Architecture]] (ISA) cards were the original PC extension cards. Originally running on an 8-bit bus, they ran on a 16-bit bus as of 1984. Like PCI slots, they supported Plug-and-Play as of 1993 (prior to this, one had to set jumpers for IRQ interrupts and such). In comparison to PCI slots, they are rather long, and often black in color. They are not found on most computers built after 1999.

=Class 2 Components: Storage=
Class 2 components are storage media for non-volatile data.

Do not put magnetic media (including floppy disks, hard drives, video cassette tape) through airport X-ray machines. The X-rays themselves are not the problem -- it's the magnetic fields from the conveyor-belt motors that all too often erase magnetic media.

Optical media -- Compact Disks (CDs) and the similar-looking DVDs -- are completely immune to magnetic fields. They can be run through airport X-ray machines without any problems.

Flash memory is also immune to magnetic fields.

Sometimes one can distinguish between &quot;fixed media&quot; (the hard drive) that is more or less permanently mounted inside the computer case, and &quot;removable media&quot; (just about every other kind of media) that is easy to pull from one computer and put into another computer.

== Floppy Disk drives ==

== Hard drive ==

A [[w:hard drive|hard drive]] consists of one or more magnetic platters or disks and a read arm with two electromagnetic coils for each disk. Each hard disk is divided into many sectors, each containing a certain amount of data. As of now, it is the cheapest and most common way to store a lot of data in a small space.

== CD-ROM drive ==

Compact Disc Read Only Memory ([[wikipedia:CD-ROM|CD-ROM]]) is a standard format for storing a variety of data.
A CD-ROM holds about '''700 MB''' of data. The media resembles a small, somewhat flexible plastic disc. Any scratch or abrasion on the data side of the disc can lead to it being unreadable.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Cleaning CD's: '''


== CD-RW drive ==

Compact disc Read/Write drives support the creation of CD-R and CD-RW discs, and also function as CD-ROM drives. These drives use low-powered lasers to 'burn' data into the active layer of the disc.

CD-R (Compact disc recordable) discs are 'write once' - once they have been written to, the data cannot be erased or changed. However, multisessions can be created and more data can be ''added''.

CD-RW (Compact disc rewritable) discs can be rewritten or erased multiple times. This is a two-pass process so they typically take twice as long as CD-R discs to produce.

CD-RW drives will typically have three speed ratings - one for reading discs, one for writing CD-R discs and another for writing CD-RW discs.
Speed ratings vary from 1x to 52x, where 1x means that a CD is written/read in 'real time' - a 52 minute audio CD would take about 52 minutes to create at 1x speed, and about 1 minute at 52x speed.

The data can be written to the disc in a variety of formats to create an audio CD, a data CD, a video CD or a photo CD. The audio CDs should play on most standard audio CD equipment and the video and photo CDs will play on many consumer DVD players.

Many CD writers (also known as 'burners') are now combination drives which also function as DVD-ROM drives.

Most DVD-RW drives also have CD-RW capabilities.

== DVD-ROM drive ==

Digital Video/Versatile Disk Read Only Memory ([[w:DVD-ROM|DVD-ROM]])

This optical drive works on a similar principle to the CD-ROM, with a laser being used to read data stored in pits on the surface of a reflective disk.  DVDs are read using a shorter wavelength of light (a red laser, rather than an infra-red one).  In addition to having a greater data-density, DVDs may be double sided and may be &quot;dual layer&quot;.

== DVD-RW drive ==

DVD's hold about 4.7 gigabytes and dual-layer disks hold 8.4 gigabytes (dual layer equipment and disks are now becoming more affordable)
&lt;!-- ==Tape drive== possibly MO(Magneto-optical) and DVD-RAM --&gt;

== Other removable media ==

=== Flash memory ===

Some common types of [[w:Flash memory card|Flash memory card]]s are CompactFlash, Secure Digital (SD), and xD. There are other formats which are falling into disuse, such as Smartmedia (SM) and MultiMediaCard (MMC).

Flash memory is faster than magnetic media and much more rugged. The main reason Flash hasn't yet replaced hard drives is that Flash memory is much more expensive per gigabyte than hard drives.

=== USB Flash drive ===
Not everyone is familiar with exactly what a USB Flash Drive is, what it’s used for and why they are becoming increasing popular. So here’s a basic guide to what a USB Flash Drive is:

USB Flash drives (also known as USB memory sticks, USB pen drives or USB thumb drives) were first commercially available in the year 2000. IBM launched them under the brand name “DiskOnKey” and they were introduced as a replacement for the floppy disc. By today’s standard the first USB flash drives had a tiny 8MB of storage capacity but even this was 4 times the amount of data that could be stored on a floppy disk.

The portability of USB flash drives and the ability to carry your data around on a key ring or lanyard and simply plug it into a PC via a USB port meant they became very popular very quickly. Essentially a USB flash drive is a just a way of storing data and storing it on something that is lightweight, easy to carry, easy to use and works on all PC and Mac platforms.

Over time larger storage capacities became available and the data transfer speeds increased to support the movement of larger amounts of information. Today typical USB flash drives are 2GB to 4GB but drives up to a whopping 64GB are now making their way into the market. A 64GB flash drive holds 8,000 times more data than the 8MB version first introduced in 2000!!

Inside every USB flash drive is a small printed circuit board (controller chip) that is connected to a flash memory module (the piece on which the data is stored). These two elements are then encased in an outer shell that is typically made of plastic, metal or more recently wood/bamboo.

The USB connector that protrudes out of the end of a flash drive is simply inserted into any PC or Mac and then the storage space on the USB flash drive is accessible and data can to saved to/from the drive. USB flash drives don’t need batteries because they draw all the power they need to work from the USB port they are plugged into.

Today USB flash drives are very popular with companies because they can print their logo or brand onto the outside casing of the flash drive and give them away at trade shows, conferenceHealth Fitness Articles, exhibitions and so on. With the large amount of storage space now available on entry level versions of the flash drive companies are also pre-loading their sales brochures and other marketing material onto the memory of the flash drive – this not only saves them printing and transportation costs but it’s a really effective way of distributing large amounts of data and information about their company.

People that are given branded flash drives (flash drives printed with a company logo on) are typically delighted to receive them because they have a high perceived value and because they can use they to save and transport their own data around.

=Class 3 Components: Peripherals=
Class 3 components are components which allow humans to interface with computers.

== Display device ==

Includes computer monitors and other display devices. [[wikipedia:Cathode ray tube|CRTs]] and [[wikipedia:Liquid crystal display|LCDs]] are common. LCDs are a more recent development, and are gradually replacing CRTs as they become more affordable.  LCD's in addition to being lighter also use less energy and generate less heat.

== Sound Output ==

Includes internal or external [[w:speaker|speaker]]s and [[w:headphone|headphone]]s.

== Mouse ==

A user interface device that can enable different kinds of control than a keyboard, particularly in [[Wikipedia:Graphical user interface|GUIs]]. It was developed at the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) and adopted and made popular with the [[wikipedia:Apple Computer|Apple]] Mac. Today, nearly all modern operating systems can use a mouse. Most mice (sometimes the plural is 'mouses' to prevent confusion with the rodent) are made from plastic, and may use a ball to track movement, an [[Wikipedia:LED|LED]] light, or a [[Wikipedia:Laser|laser]].  Today you can get a wireless mouse that allows you to easily give a presentation without being tied to a desk. These mouses are usually LED or Laser based tracking. 

=== History ===

In 1964, the first prototype computer mouse was made to use with a graphical user interface (GUI), ''windows''. [[Wikipedia:Douglas_Engelbart|Douglas Engelbart]] received a [[wikipedia:patent|patent]] for the wooden shell with two metal wheels (computer mouse U.S. Patent # 3,541,541) in 1970, describing it in the patent application as an ''&quot;X-Y position indicator for a display system.&quot;''. It was nicknamed the mouse because the tail came out the end, Engelbart revealed about his invention. His version of windows was not considered patentable (no software patents were issued at that time), but Douglas Engelbart has over 45 other patents to his name.
There was also a DB-9 connector that was used to be an old serial mouse connector.

== Keyboard ==

A [[wikipedia:Computer keyboard|keyboard]] is an input device which is connected to a computer and used to type instructions or information into the computer. Typically, a keyboard has about 100 or so keys.

* Keyboards differ between languages. Most English-speaking people use what is called a QWERTY layout. This refers to the order of the top row of keys. Some foreign languages (i. e. German) use QWERTZ, where the Z and Y are switched.
* Many laptop computers do not include a number pad. (There is sometimes a function on the keyboard to enable a numpad-like mode.)
* Modern keyboards sometimes have extra controls such as volume, and keys that can be programmed to bring up programs of the user's choice.

== Printer ==

A [[w:printer|printer]] makes marks on paper. It can print images and text.

The most common types of printers today are

* [[w:Laser printer|Laser printer]]: Prints very crisp text, but cheaper models can only print in black and white. Good for places like offices where high printing speed is needed.
* [[w:Color inkjet printer|Color inkjet printer]]: Prints photos and other images in color (using 4 colors of ink -- cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), but the text they print is often not as crisp as a laser printer.

The average printer of the early 1990s would connect to a computer through its parallel port. To connect it to the computer via parallel port, one would have to screw it into the port. Today many printers are connected through USB. This is because it is easier to connect and remove through a simple plug and play system. It also allows for faster transfer speeds than parallel.

== Scanner ==

A [[w:scanner|scanner]] is a device for digitizing paper documents into images that may be manipulated by a computer.  The two main classes of scanner are

* hand-held scanners (in which the user manually drags a small scanning head over the document), and
* flat-bed scanners (which are designed to accommodate a whole sheet of paper, which is then examined by a motorised scanning head).

If the original document contained text, [[w:Optical Character Recognition|Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR) software may be used to reconstruct the text of the document from the scanned images.

== Modem ==

A contraction of &quot;Modulator - demodulator&quot;, a [[w:modem|modem]] allows a computer to communicate over an analogue medium (most commonly a telephone line).  The modem encodes digital signals from the computer as analogue signals suitable for transmission (modulation) and decodes digital data from a modulated analogue signal (demodulation).  Using modems two computers may communicate over a telephone line, with the data passed between them being represented as sound.

Modems are usually involved with [[w:dial-up|dial-up]] internet services. As broadband catches on, they are falling into disuse. However, the devices used to connect to broadband connections are also called modems, specifically DSL Modems or Cable Modems.


== CD-Rom's ==
A CDROM (compact disk read-only memory), also written as CD-ROM, is a type of optical storage media that allows data to be written to it only once. This contrasts with memory, whose contents can be accessed (i.e., read and written to) at extremely high speeds but which are retained only temporarily (i.e., while in use or only as long as the power supply remains on). Although the disc media and the drives of the CD and CD-ROM are, in principle, the same, there is a difference in the way data storage is organized. Two new sectors were defined, Mode 1 for storing computer data and Mode 2 for compressed audio or video/graphic data.


===CD-ROM Mode 1 === 
It is the mode used for CD-ROMs that carry data and applications only. In order to access the thousands of data files that may be present on this type of CD, precise addressing is necessary

===CD-ROM Mode 2 ===
CD-ROM Mode 2 is used for compressed audio/video information and uses only two layers of error detection and correction, the same as the CD-DA. Therefore, all 2,336 bytes of data behind the sync and header bytes are for user data

=Appendix A: Connectors and Cables=
There are many different types of connectors and cables in personal computers, and this section will address as many as the various editors deem relevant.

== Internal Connectors ==

Several types of cables are used to connect components together inside the case, providing power and a path for data.  These include:

* Motherboard Power Connector: This connector is designed especially to move electricity from the power supply to the motherboard.  Older computers use the AT power connections, with two six-pin connectors lined up side by side.  ATX motherboards used a single connector with 20 pins arranged in two rows of 10. 
**Many motherboards now also use supplementary power connectors, such as a 4 pin plug ''specifically'' for the CPU supply. 
**Some others have ''more'' than 20 pins for the main connector. The extra pins are in the form of a 'separate' connector, that fits onto the end of the standard 20 pin connector. This may be used or not as required by the particular motherboard.
** The PCI-e inteface may also require the use of further power cables from the power supply.

* Power Connectors for Drives: Hard drives, optical drives, and, increasingly, high-end video cards use a 4-wire power connection, of which several are available from a power supply.  Floppy drives use a smaller connector.
**With the introduction of the SATA interface for data another type of power connector for drives was also introduced. This is thinner than the previous power connector.

* 40 and 80-pin IDE Cables: These cables are used by hard drives and optical drives to transfer data to and from the motherboard. These are now sometimes called PATA (Parallel ATA) cables to differentiate from the more recent SATA.

* SATA (Serial ATA) Cables: These cables are now used by most hard drives and even optical drives to carry data to and from the motherboard. They are much thinner than PATA ribbon cables, and the connectors are much smaller. Generally red coloured. 
** SATA drives generally also require a new type of power connector, though some can also use the older white 'Molex' plug. Adaptors are available if the power supply doesn't have the correct connector.

* 34-pin Floppy Cables: These are used to connect floppy drives to floppy disk connectors on the mainboard/motherboard.

== External Connectors ==

Without connections to the rest of the world, a computer would just be a fancy paperweight.  Numerous connectors are used to make a computer useful.

* AT Keyboard Connector: Found on older computers, this connector is large and round with five pins.
* PS/2 Connector: This connector is currently the most popular for connecting both the keyboard and mouse.  Note that older mice once used serial ports (defined below), and newer mice frequently use the Universal Serial Bus (USB).
* VGA Connector: This connector has 3 rows of 5 pins each, and is used to connect the computer to the display screen.
* Parallel Port (DB-25): This connector is commonly used to interface with printers, and can also transfer between computers. It has been mostly replaced by USB.
* Serial Port (DB-9): This 9-pin connector is used to connect all sorts of devices, but is being replaced by USB.  It has been used in the past to connect mice and transfer data between computers.
* [[wikipedia:Universal Serial Bus|Universal Serial Bus (USB)]]:  This relatively recent connector can connect the computer to almost anything.  It has been used for storage devices, printers, sound, mice, keyboards, cameras, and even networking. USB 2.0 allows transfer speeds of up to 480 Mbps.
* [[wikipedia:FireWire|FireWire]] (IEEE 1394) port: This high-speed connection runs at 400Mbps (1394a) or 800Mbps (1394b), and can connect up to 63 external devices to a single port. Most digital camcorders have a firewire port to connect to a computer.
* RJ-11 (phone) Connectors: This is the type of connector you will see on phones and modems.  It is not used for much else.
* RJ-45 Connectors: These are used to connect computers to an Ethernet network.  Maximum speed of such a connection is now 1000 Mbps (= 1Gbps).
* Audio Connectors: Three of these connectors can be found on an average sound card, and are used to connect to microphones (usually pink), speakers (usually green), and other audio devices (usually blue). The external device connector is usually a silver-colored or gold-plated plug that fits into a round hole.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Front Page Cleanup==
I think the front page needs to be cleaned up a little. The top sections are good along with the contents of 'The Basics' section but further down it gets a little disorganised. It needs to be cleaned up and filled in to make the front page more presentable. Also, do we really need a 'Contributors' section? I thought the point of Wikis was that everyone contributed, it seems against the ethos to attribute certain pages to certain people. [[User:Fyorl|Fyorl]] ([[User talk:Fyorl|talk]]) 11:37, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

== Working with Files ==
I plan on adding a section related to working with files. I will discuss mainly the use of the f(open|write|close) in conjunction with file() and file_get_contents() as well as devoting a small section to file_put_contents and how to emulate it with PHP 4.

I'm just checking that nobody is already working on a similar section. If I hear no response in a couple of days I will start work on the article on my Talk page and then tranfer it over upon completion.

The article will also make a reference to serialization. Since this could appear in both the Database section and the Session section, I was wondering if it was best to create a separate page and link to it from within all the other pages?
[[User:Fyorl|Fyorl]] ([[User talk:Fyorl|talk]]) 16:52, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

==Naming policy?==

I am not new to Wikipedia, but this is the first time I have looked at a Wikibook. I have some confusion about the template that says the book's title does not adhere to the &quot;naming policy.&quot; What is wrong with the title, and how does it not adhere? Here I have seen discussions about the book's content, cover, PHP version, and so forth, but nothing regarding the name or that template. To anyone that may advise--thanks. [[User:67.42.14.57|67.42.14.57]] 18:19, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

:If you click on the [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy|link]] in the naming policy notice, you'll see the preferred naming convention.  This wikibook used to use a colon (:) separator for sub pages, which resulted in the need to manually link to the index (example: [[pHP Programming/hello world|hello world]]).  Currently, the barely-existing PEAR page seems to be the only page still using the depricated naming convention.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] ([[user:Banzaimonkey|talk]]) 20:28, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

::As it seems that all of the pages are in order (excepting PEAR), I removed the template.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] ([[user:Banzaimonkey|talk]]) 20:33, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

:::But now it is back; anyone care to explain? &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:Users:Samwilson|Sam Wilson]] (Australia) 21:36, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== Version ==
Are we talking PHP version 4 or 5 here?

PHP5 was recently released, and features the ZEND II engine, which includes enhanced OOP(Object Oriented Programming) features, better XML support, and built in  [http://www.sqlite.org/ SQLite] support.

PHP4, on the other hand, is still the prevalant web technology, and I suspect that most servers will not be offering PHP5 support for some time. 

Either way, I suggest that OOP be included in the 'advanced php' section. I just don't know how to write it because of the discrepancies between php4 and php5.
--[[User:Noah|Noah]] 20:19, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)

Ok, since I recieved no response, I will assume that this page is geared towards PHP5. I am going to start writing the OOP features accordingly. I will also edit the intro to make this obvious. --[[User:Noah|Noah]] 18:46, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I think for anything specific to one version, we should show the equivalent in the older / newer version if possible. --[[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 01:47, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I'd like to second this notion, and extend it.  Whenever possible I think functions that are aviable in both versions should be used. For most of the introductory material it doesn't matter.  OOP can be part of a later discussion, along with other major version 5 improvements.  Since these books are perminant static things we can always drop discussion of version 5 when it becomes the standard (in other words we can stop singling out the difference at that point).  I would expect most people learn PHP at the moment are still working in 4. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 06:28, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== External links? ==

There are many &quot;dead&quot; links here to pages that don't exist on wikibooks, and will most likely never exist.
For example: GUI or Rasmus Lardorf will most likely not get their own books. It's much more likely that they'll get a Wikipedia page(GUI already has one), and I think that's where those links should take you...

I'd say change them to link to Wikipedia if you find them then, just use common sense. --[[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 06:15, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)

[http://www.landofcode.com/php/ Learn PHP]

== Smarty Templates ==

There is no reason to discuss Smarty Templates as part of the language. You can either hit them in a round about PEAR and Templating or put the package in a list of &quot;useful&quot; PHP projects.
:While Smarty is not part of the core language, it is mentioned in many other PHP books, and it is a very useful to have knowledge of its features.  However, I think merging Templates and Smarty would be useful.

== Include/Require functions ==

There seem to be at least 3 sections which talk about require(_once) and include(_once) ([[PHP Programming/headers and footers|Headers and footers]], [[PHP Programming/template|Template]] and [[PHP Programming/PHP Include Files|Including Files]].
Since these deal with basically the same subject, couldn't they be merged into a single page about the use of require and include, and a list/example of the uses of these functions? -- [[User:DorianGray|DorianGray]]

If I don't see any reasons why in the next few days I'll delete Templates and Headers and Footers and move all relevant content to Including Files. --[[User:DorianGray|DorianGray]] 06:58, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Internal Functions? ==

I know that the PHP website has a lot of information about PHP's internal functions, but do we want to start highlighting the ones most used?  I'm particularly interested in the mail() function myself.

&lt;[[User:Niallj|niallj]] 20:59, 3 September 2005 (UTC)&gt; I would say that's unnecessary, unless it comes up in the course of a lesson. I feel that a structured, lesson based approached would be better. Example: a lesson on &quot;Sending E-Mail with PHP&quot; rather than &quot;mail()&quot;, and &quot;Working with Arrays&quot; as opposed to &quot;Array functions&quot; or &quot;array_sort()&quot; &lt;/[[User:Niallj|niallj]]&gt;

== MySQL in PHP5 ==

Should it be mentioned that PHP5 on Windows no longer has MySQL support built in, but has it shipped as a separate DLL that needs to be referenced in php.ini?

Hi, i think that this should be mentioned in the php:mysql page, not the main page. I wrote that it should be downloaded separately -- [[User:Wykis]]

== Sub-pages ==

&lt;[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 00:20, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)&gt; Shouldn't the pages for setting up your environment be on subpages?  It makes this main page seem awfully noisy to have them right there. &lt;/[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]]&gt;

:&lt;[[User:davidd|davidd]] 23:05, 11 Dec 2005&gt; I agree, I think there seems to be alot of emphasis on lesser PHP topics such as setup, templating etc. and there should be more PHP code and the setup stuff should be in a sub-topic&lt;/[[User:davidd|davidd]]&gt;

== Accessing files ==

I'd like to see a section on reading and writing from/to files. Anyone? Thanks!
:I'm writing it now if no-one has any objections. I plan to put it in the basic section as a starter's guide to file manipulation.--[[User:Davidd|Davidd]] 23:09, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

== echo/print functions/constructs ==

&lt;[[User:Niallj|niallj]] 20:53, 3 September 2005 (UTC)&gt;On the [[PHP Programming/hello world|Hello World]] page, and maybe in other places that I haven't noticed yet, echo and print are referred to as functions. Since they are actually language constructs in their own right, should they be more accurately referred to simply as statements?&lt;/[[User:Niallj|niallj]]&gt;

== The newline &quot;operator&quot; ==

&lt;[[User:Niallj|niallj]] 21:06, 3 September 2005 (UTC)&gt; In [[PHP Programming/basics#Example_1_-_Basic_arithmetic_operators|PHP Basics Example #1: Basic Arithmetic Operators]], a reference is made to a newline &quot;operator&quot;. The example in question is actually referring to the process of adding a newline by using the \n escape sequence in a double quoted string. I recommend that firstly this reference is clarified, explaining escape characters, and that secondly, since PHP is most often used with HTML, that this example be rewritten to use the &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; tag- it being the case that in a browser, the \n character does not cause a newline. &lt;/[[User:Niallj|niallj]]&gt;

I've got to agree on this too. This is so annoying when user changes the page to rendered html page. for example, &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt; to '''text''' and &lt;br /&gt; to new line... We are not evaluating html here. HTML is just an example. Please don't edit any pages just to do that. Thank You [[User:Wykis|Wykis]] 07:03, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

== where are the Snafus? ==

The part that always seem to be left out from programming tutorials, or, if present, truncated to incomprehensibility (part of the ph.D curriculum I guess.. ;) is a bunch of common errors in writing the code.

Anyone who has done any programming have made mistakes that take forever to track down.
Please add a section with the most obvious ones, and put it in the 'beginner' section.
(a personal favourite is 'if ($X == $y;) {...}' which took a few re-readings to catch..)

== How about some exercises per lesson? ==
Not ''just'' simple questions. I mean something along the lines of &quot;Make a script that prints 'foo' if 'x' is true&quot; or something like that. Doing this helps keep the concepts stuck in your head, and would be tragic if this textbook didn't have it.

== First person writing? ==

Should addendums be added in first person, such as &quot;I recommend ...&quot;? How should this be handled? [[User:209.149.56.162|209.149.56.162]] 00:35, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Hey, i just noticed this too, I will correct the mistakes as the book is written by a lot of people,not one person ;p [[User:Wykis|Wykis]], 14:42 14 January 2006

There are many thing we can add on this section.

==New presentation ==
I propose to change the look of the PHP book : we can use this look [[fr:Programmation PHP]] (sorry in french). Do you like this ? [[User:Merrheim|Merrheim]] 10:07, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

wow, wish i knew about this b4. i think this page is going to change my life --[[User:Nerd42|Nerd42]] 16:58, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

I don't agree on this. I like the idea though. The design of that French page looks good but I prefer this book to be just like a normal book. Just a book :) [[User:Wykis|Wykis]] 18:20, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:Wikibooks are viewed on a computer.  Since there isn't a tangible book with pages to turn, an outline view would be really nice.  Getting between lessons in the current layout is rather tedious, and a TOC / Index / Outline view would probably work better than putting &quot;Next Page&quot; links on each lesson because the ordering of the lesson can change, and the navigation would break.  Changing the formatting would be a lot of work, but we should look into it (it doesn't have to be a carbon copy of the French layout).  It doesn't do anyone much good if the information herein is inaccessible.  --banzaimonkey

::I'm working on some indexes at the moment, so don't go running off and do something I've already done.  ;)  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|Banzaimonkey]] 19:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

::Make sure to let us know if your done or a estimate of when you're done would be nice as I believe this book is very incomplete and needs a lot added to it.[[User:AlReece45|AlReece45]] 02:39, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

== For MediaWiki ==

it would be cool if there was a section on advice for would-be developers about writing bug fixes for MediaWiki. [[User:128.250.37.103|128.250.37.103]] 07:41, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

:: Already exists? Did you try googlling about this? [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/ http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/] helps quiet a lot. This is a Programming book for PHP, NOT for MediaWiki. Instead, try looking in IRC and [http://wikimedia.org/]. [[User:Wykis|Wykis]] 18:18, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Flag Frog = Ripped from Smarty? ==

Flag Frog templating system looks like a rip from Smarty template engine. Should this be removed from the page? [[User:Wykis|Wykis]] 18:16, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
:It looks like a fork of Smarty-Light.  It's under the GPL, so I see no issue with it in and of itself, but I don't think it's something that needs to be posted on the PHP wikibook considering that as of now, there are 164 downloads in total of all version of the FlatFrog package.  Has anyone here heard of it before? [[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 17:57, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Major Changes to this Wikibook ==

I'm planning a significant overhaul for this wikibook.  It currently has a decent amount of information but suffers from irregular organization, lack of verbocity, and has room for substantial additions of content.  I've been writing a small todo list for myself, which you can view on my [[Wikipedia:User:Banzaimonkey|userpage]].  If you're an active reader / contributor and would like to take part in a discussion about changes to this wikibook, please reply in '''this''' page or contact me on my [[Wikipedia:User_talk:Banzaimonkey|talk page]].  Otherwise I'll just assume that I'm the only person here who is active and will carry on with the changes as time permits.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|Banzaimonkey]] 09:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

:Update:  I have been working on thing for a few weeks and am ready to proceed with a few things on my list.  Code examples will be wrapped in a color-coded box designating the type of code example (see [[Template:Code|Code Template]] for details).  I've also created a cover for the book which you can view [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Image:PHPWikibookCover.png here].  I've tagged the book as having a deprecated naming convention, and I will begin the process of migrating them to the new namespace once I decide what that namespace will be (probably [[PHP_Programming]].  This will enable root auto-links on each page (returning the user to the main page), as well as conforming to the new [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy|naming convention]] (as of March 1rst, 2006).  Next on my list is an overhaul of the table of contents, but I'm still unsure how this will be reorganized.  If I have free time after all that, I'll go through this talk page and clean it up a bit.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 02:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

::Update:  The overhaul on the table of contents will probably take place ''before'' the migration.  This will allow me to figure out how things need to be organized when they're moved.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 06:39, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

== Color Code Boxes ==

I have wrapped the first two Basic programming lessons.  All code is contained in a [[Template:Code|colored template]].  You can view them [[pHP Programming/hello world|here]] and [[pHP Programming/basics|here]].  Please leave your feedback in response to this post.  My own thoughts are positive, but I'm not entirely satisfied with the functionality.  I may rewrite the template with a more modular, extensible approach.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 06:36, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

I think that it is a good idea.  Makes for easier reading and quicker reference.[[User:Bounton|Bounton]] 08:26, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

What do you think about adding syntax highlighting? In my opinion, it makes the code much easier to read. --[[User:King elessar|King elessar]] 00:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
* I like this idea if it's at all possible to do automatic syntax highlighting of PHP code within MediaWiki somehow.  Also, have you taken a look at [[Template:Code:PHPHTML]]?  I don't know if you're already using it but it's a perfect fit.  Keep up the good work. --[[User:Spoom|Spoom]] 18:03, 22 September 2006 (UTC)


Very interesting. I like it. Helps to highlight what we are trying to do with the code.


Its a good idea!

Love it. Reading is much easier on the eyes

good idea

Excellent idea.  Much easier to read.  Go on u's.

== Book Cover ==

I've added the book cover to the main page to garner attention and feedback.  Please leave your feedback here.  When the book is reorganized and migrated, the book cover will appear on the main page and will link to the table of contents.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 06:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

I personally like the design. It seems friendly, colourful and has PHP code and the elephant in it.
It also seems like a cover you might see on a book. Good work.[[User:213.168.233.251|213.168.233.251]]

The licensing sounds incompatible (combination of GNU GPL and GFDL) - maybe [http://www.elroubio.net/ elroubio] would agree to license the elephant under the GFDL?

:This licensing crap and legal encumbrance is the primary reason I haven't done any work on wikibooks lately.  It's too tedious trying to figure out how to get everything done legally, much less organized, formatted, proofread, etc.  I don't do legal work unless I'm paid for it.  If someone else wants to contact him (he speaks French, btw), go ahead, otherwise... *shrugs*  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 03:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

:The GFDL is for documentation. Why do you want to use it for a image? —[[User:Andrew Hampe|Andrew Hampe]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Andrew Hampe|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:38, 24 July 2007 (UTC)

::I had been under the impression that contributions to wikibooks were limited to GFDL (since the ''text'' is licensed as GFDL).  It seems that is not the case, so I have changed the license to GPL to avoid any particular incompatibilities with the source images. --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] ([[user:Banzaimonkey|talk]]) 19:55, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

Ehh. I like it, brings good attention to the page

I like it. It makes more sense than ''Programming Python'', the O'Reilly book. It has a mouse on it. '''SNAKES EAT MICE.''' (I'm curious, what does that code do?) --[[User:74.101.118.195|74.101.118.195]] 04:28, 23 July 2007 (UTC)

== Reorg ==

I am going to reorganize the information contained in the &quot;Hello World!&quot;, Nuts and Bolts, and commenting and Style modules to a more K&amp;R approach:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&lt;li /&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variables&lt;li /&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operators&lt;li /&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expressions&lt;li /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I think giving each topic its own module will make a better layout for reference use and break up complex topics so that they will be easier to learn. It will also be easier for us to maintain since it is clear where topics will go (trying to avoid duplicate data), so added bonus.  Any issues?  --[[User:Karl McClendon|Karl McClendon]] ([[User talk:Karl McClendon|talk]]) 12:23, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

:As long as navigation is clear I have no problem... [[User:Fyorl|Fyorl]] ([[User talk:Fyorl|talk]]) 15:28, 21 February 2008 (UTC)

From the lead: ''Its popularity derives from its C-like syntax, its speed and its simplicity.''

PHP is not exactly known for speed, see for example, [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2359718/php-speed-vs-other-languages PHP speed vs other languages].

Shouldn't this statement simply be left out?

--[[User:Mortense|Mortense]] ([[User talk:Mortense|talk]]) 11:47, 5 December 2010 (UTC)
:Agreed. I've removed the statement from the lead. - [[w:User:EdoDodo|&lt;font color=&quot;#21421E&quot; face=&quot;Harrington&quot;&gt;EdoDodo&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[w:User talk:EdoDodo|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#33dd44&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:31, 12 December 2010 (UTC)

== Style? ==

We need to define a way to write the code in examples here.

I propose:

*'else if', not 'elseif'
*space after 'if', 'else if', and 'else'
*four space indentation
*&lt;?php and ?&gt; are on their own lines
*Class names are LikeThis
*function and variable names are likeThis
*space after commas

Any thoughts or ideas?

This is for the Shimano A20 &quot;rapidfire&quot; shifter switch (on the handlebars) but a similar situation may exist for other brands/models.
The shifter consists of two levers and an enclosed ratchet mechanism with pawls.  If pushing on the lever fails to move the idler wheels of the derailleur (on the chain), then a likely cause is lack of lubrication.  If the old lubricant gets hard, the pawls will stick.

So remove the switch and then remove a cover.  Push-pull the pawl that's giving trouble with a small screwdriver and watch what happens.
The pawls have tiny springs that push them into contact with a lugged wheel.  If a pawl fails to maintain contact with the lugged (or
notched) wheel, then, if the spring isn't broken, it can be fixed by lubing the pivot point of the pawl.  Work the pawl back and forth with a small screwdriver, etc. right after applying a drop or two of lube oil.  When the spring freely moves the pawl into contact with the lugged wheel, it's fixed.

== &quot;Meta&quot; in Metaphysics ==

Michael, I believe this passage has to be corrected:

&quot;Early use of the term simply referred to the topics covered by the work placed before (hence meta) the Physics in the traditional ordering of Aristotle's works.&quot;

&quot;meta&quot; in this sense means the opposite, that is, it means: &quot;after&quot;.  Please read this:

&quot;The philosopher and editor Andronicus of Rhodes gave this title to Aristotle's writings that came after the Physics in his collected works.&quot;

http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000321

Thank you.

That's an interesting definition of metaphysics and definitely one I'll consider. I am not sure if I would go with it however. Perhaps you could add some reference to the concept of &quot;reality&quot; which is the way I have most often seen metaphysics defined.

I've always thought that the difference between science (physics) and metaphysics was that with science only phenomena are explained - and, to the extent that this is possible, phenomena are explained always in terms of simpler phenomena, with the minimal use of concepts that to not correspond to some simpler form of sense-data (science still has problems with some concepts that are are not quite sensible e.g. time)

Metaphysics on the other hand deals with reality - the reality that underlies the phenomena, the reality that is not knowable directly. Metaphysical theories then are necessarily speculative and are, for the agnostic, impossible to verify or judge (this does not imply they are of no value - they can be explored as interesting fictions for example)

My explanation is not better than your own, but perhaps you could incorporate a little of the above into your explanation.

The problem is that there is no one definition of the term that is universally acceptable, I think.

Best of luck,

Paul Barry

The statement that &quot;Evil does not exist&quot; is metaphysical because it is a statement that deals with the object 'evil' as opposed to 'good' which is a metaphysical subject, whereas the statement that &quot;all things are composed of smaller things, which are in turn composed of still smaller things, and so on down to infinity&quot; is definitely not metaphysics, utmost a concern of physical sciences.

caused me some concern. Though mathematical infinity exists, there is 'no way to prove that infinity exists physically'. That means that if you look deeper into a cell and find atoms, and then collide small electrons with atoms to find quarks and smaller particles, you will be able to detect these subatomic particles in a magnetic field in a particle accelerator. Though physical science has accepted that idea that even these particles can be theoretically broken down into even smaller particles, this hypothesis cannot be tested and thus cannot be considered &quot;physics&quot;. Therefore I would argue that your statement is in the realm of metaphysics and not physics.

==Huh?==

This module uses a very strange (and confusing) use of &quot;metaphysics&quot;. It's not &quot;beyond physics&quot;, it's &quot;about physics&quot;. For example, a discussion of how the 7 (I think it's 7 now)  forces of physics work is a discussion of physics, while the statement &quot;all physical objects obey a finite number of physical laws&quot; is a metaphysical statement. IOW, physics is about the what and how, metaphysics is about the why (or perhaps the who, when mixed with theology). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:22, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

::You're correct.  But the original use of &quot;meta&quot; didn't have a philosophical meaning.  It simply pointed to the bibliographic sequence Andronicus of Rhodes established, that is, the metaphysical books were put AFTER the physical-nature books. Centuries passed and the European philosophers took the word in a post-Neo-Platonic way. Speaking circularly, they metaphysically interpreted the word &quot;metaphysical&quot; and Andronicus intentions. [[User:201.19.217.19|201.19.217.19]] 14:48, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</text>
