{{equipment}}

A '''mandoline''' is a device for making even slices.
It is composed of a fixed, horizontal, blade mounted slightly above a platform.  Food is slid across the platform, and a slice is removed from the bottom.
Higher-quality mandolines have adjustable cutting thicknesses, and/or interchangeable blades for [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienne]] or waffle cut.

Mandolines (or their close cousins, the &quot;V&quot;-slicer and mandolin) are the most efficient manual method to slice large quantities of firm vegetables - such as potatoes, squash, yams, or carrots - into regular pieces. Some brands come with vertical blades as well for cutting French fries or julienne strips.


==Warning==
Mandolines (or their close cousins, the &quot;V&quot;-slicer and mandolin) are the most efficient manual method to slice your hand. Higher-quality mandolines allow for adjustable injury.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi
I'm trying to find out if deep-frying will leach beneficial oil out of fish?

:Coat the fish, as in the [[Cookbook:Fried Fish|Fried Fish]] recipe, and there's no way the fish oils could leak out. Uncoated fish would probably fall apart anyway.


---
In regards to the food poisoning: If you let bacteria/organisms grow in the oil, and then you heat the oil to over 300 degrees farenheit, won't that kill/neutralize all the dangerous organisms?
-Chris W.

:My understanding is that the primary concern is with the breakdown of the oil more than with bacterial growth. However, oil reuse is the norm; you can detect rancid oil quite easily by smell, and just discard it when that time comes. To prevent rancidity, filter the oil before storage. I'm looking for hard sources on this, though, before putting it out there as more than just one of several sides of the argument.

The link to the Blender 2.3 book is pointing to the store. But that book has been made available online Ref: http://www.blender.org/cms/Documentation.628.0.html. But I am wondering whether the link should be left as such considering the few bucks the blender foundation could potentially gain. I surely want to help these guys for producing the terrific software. But I can't right now. Hence this dilemma.


I just updated the link to the Windows installer, but should we even be linking directly to the files on this page? Maybe it shoud just link directly to the download page? -- Shawn Fumo


Use these discussion pages when you run into a problem with these tutorials.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:29, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)



Blender runs really slowly for me even though I have a revelitivly fast computer. Is it because I dont have Python instaled or somthing else?

      <text xml:space="preserve">I had to look for a while to find the set smooth button, it would be nice to give a description of where it is such as &quot;in the 'Link and Materials' group of the button window.&quot; --Kevin

When I use the setsurf command only the lower part of the first created leg is smoothed out -- I feel as though I followed the instructions well to this point so I'm a bit puzzled.  --Travis

====Annoyances==

My mans head appears to be a seperate entity from the model itself. How do I merge it with the model so I can proceed? I succeeded once, but the guy just turned into circles and wouldn't turn into one smoothed surface like it should.


== A Strange Error... ==

When I used the setsurf, I had two small problems.  My model had a bump on its arm, which I realized was caused by some extra edges that had somehow been accidentaly created and become attached, and were warping the arm out of shape.  That was easy to fix - I jsut deleted the edges.  But I've also had another problem I haven't been able to solve yet - one of the arms didn't become rounded - it just ends in a flat circle, although the edge is smoothed.  Does anyone have any idea why this could have happened, or what I can do about it?  I know it's not that important, but now I'm curious! [[User:Oracleoftruth|Oracleoftruth]] 05:56, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)


== Possible Solution... ==

My hunch is the same thing that I did in error -- you need to make sure that when you're extruding that you actually select all four vertices.  If you keep the view in the front view and select the two visible vertices you aren't extruding the region.  You'll know if you're extruding correctly if the option box asks what you want to extrude -- it needs to have the &quot;region&quot; option in there.  Rotate your view and be sure to select all four vertices -- using shift+R.click if you have to.  That was my error at least.   - Travis June 9th, 2005

:That seemed to work, although that wasn't exactly the problem I was having!  Anyways, my person now has lovely round arms, so all is well.  Thanks. --Oracleoftruth 17:12, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

== umm my whole guy turns to circles ==

Ok so I sub surface and my whole guy turns to circles sorry for spelling 2:00am.....oh and I selected nothing and same result...also i tryed selecting the head and body...Same thing....And then the head alone....still the same thing lol...... but all the same results, so what do i do!
thanks a bunch

: Weellll...  it sounds like it's working!  When you turn on subsurfs, he should no longer be blocky, but rounded, like in the pictures provided.  Your draw mode might need to be changed; try hitting the ZKEY to see if that makes things a little better for you.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 15:33, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

nope it all turns to blocks to sphere and the head gets smother
thanks David.S

: That's what it's supposed to be doing.  Post a screenshot if you're in doubt.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:30, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

I've had this problem with the faces turning into circles. I pressed exclude doubles and the problem solved

Where is exclude doubles???

== I have same circleproblem ==

Guy turns in separate circles. Does anybody know why?

Similar problem here. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to merge several shapes together to make a single object. On the extrude, I somehow ended up with small gaps between the squares, although I did end up extruding off of the whole object instead of the face (trying a different, yet similar simple shape). If there's some way to merge several objects into one for the purposes of the subsurf, here would be a great place to add it or link to it.

== Optimal Draw button ==

The paragraph discussing &quot;Optimal Draw&quot; is confusing.  It seems to mix discussion of Optimal Draw with the Apply button.

Also, in Blender 2.42a, &quot;Optimal Draw&quot; is now a bar just below &quot;Render Levels&quot; in the Subsurf part of the Modifiers tab.


== Can't find subsurf button ==

I have no subsurf button in my mesh buttons panel. I see Auto Smooth, Degr: 30, TexMesh:, Centre, Centre New, Centre Cursor, etc. Am I lookin in the right place? I'm using a 2.40 alpha release.

* I have the same problem. i think its just because we're using the newer release. if i figure out how to do this in the newer release i will add it in.

Guys I figured it out, All You have to do is type in Shift+The letter &quot;o&quot;.
and thats it then your subsurf button will appear.
Hope that helps it sure helped me! peace, printf(&quot;Joker:)&quot;);

You have to click on &quot;Add Modifier&quot; in the &quot;Modifiers&quot; panel. Then click subsurf.

== Yet Another Strange Error ==

Well, my guy looks odd : only the last built cube (right &quot;foot&quot;) is &quot;subsurfed&quot; (no pb with the head thought, previously sphered with no pb). I have no doubles, tried to select all the cubes etc... all I got is quite a loosy pirate :/

please help, I want a ninja !

-- idDxD (Jan 19 2006)

solved, had too much duplicated verticles.. but smoothing is very shy, rounds hardly the edges, and not the extremities

== Solution if some sides don't get rounded == 

Somewhat later in the tutorial (with the hat), you use Remove Doubles.  This button is called &quot;Rem Doubles&quot;, and it's in the Mesh Tools tab.  Turns out, a lot of the &quot;why isn't this side rounded&quot; problems are a result of extra vertices that you can't see!  So click that button.  I tried it with the sample file you can download (which had a couple of face-not-rounded errors) and it fixed it up!  Hope that helps.  --[[User:Nanodeath|Nanodeath]] 22:53, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
---- I had trouble when I had not extended all the vertices of the cube. I had to switch to different views to find and select those vertices. Then in the menu that pops up I had to select region i.e. to extend the whole selected region. Thanks Vinod Isaac [http://vinodisaac.com Vinod Isaac's Home Page]

== Fix page please? ==

The page seems extremely messy, like it's been drawn all over with slight comments. Could it be cleaned up by someone with exprience please? I'm finding it difficult to follow because comments like &quot;in latest versions try X Y Z&quot;, when I've just tried Y Z. Wouldn't it be best to just assume people are using the latest version?

== Set Smooth Error ==

I'm having an odd error when I press &quot;Set Smooth&quot;. Everything looks okay, but some odd triangles are appearing on my figure's head. Here's a 
[http://www.box.net/shared/0nq7ly9udm screenshot] (Download it, don't click preview).
Interestingly, when I render it, it's fine. Any ideas?

==No Boxy Cage?==
For some reason when I'm in edit mode there's no box cage around my subsurfed model. Just a bunch of new edges, which I think would make the next tutorial rather difficult. I tried playing around with a few things in the subsurf menu to see if that changed anything, but nothing seems to work. I'm using ver 2.49b if that makes any difference. To be more specific, if I switch bewteen edit and object mode before I hit &quot;apply&quot; it has the boxy cage, but as soon as I hit &quot;apply&quot; it goes away. Clicking the little circle button mentioned in the tutorial makes no difference either way. Is it a setting I may have accidentally changed?

== Optimal Draw ==
I too have the same problem as the one described in &quot;Set Smooth Error&quot;. I believe it might be related to the fact that I haven't selected the Optimal Draw button. Where can I &lt;u&gt;find this button&lt;/u&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Blender 2.57&lt;/b&gt;? (Thanks for the help).

== Is there a step missing between the last module and this one? ==

At the end of the last module, the simple man has 3 cubes extruded out as each arm. However, the image in this module seems to have five cubes extended out as each arm though there is no step that asks us to add more cubes. Its fine for this module, but in the next module, while chopping the forearm off to raise it, the body gets very disproportionate with only three cubes (after bending the torso and chopping off the last cube that was the forearm, the forearm is extruded up from the biceps. (It is possible I missed a step somewhere, but I don't think so).

== High-poly? ==

This term is introduced without any explanation of what it means... and I sure ain't got no idea about its meaning.  Maybe someone could put something in brackets after it.</text>

I felt like the explanation of the arms and legs got a bit cursory. It would be nice to have more pictures of what you did and more explanation of how you got that look. Some people (like me) are here not to just learn how to use Blender, but also to learn how to model. Thanks. --Kevin

: It's on my to-do list.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:41, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I made it to the end, but the second to last picture shows a set of toes the instructions dont provide!  Would love to know how to make those too.  Thanks for the hardwork!  I have the extruded feet though. Thanks a bunch again.

== Feature missing from Blender? ==

I can't find the selection mode buttons in Blender anywhere, and CTRL+TAB doesn't do anything.  Skips from the Lock button to the Render button on the header.  It's version 2.34, if that helps.

: That feature was introduced in version 2.35.  The current release is 2.36.  You need to update your version of the blender.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 00:08, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== selecting edges with older versions ==

Is there a way to select edges with older versions?
Updating from version 2.34 to 2.35 is an effort not everybody wants to take.
So what are the alternatives to get the same results with selecting edges using older versions of blender?

: Yes.  Selecting all vertices that are connected to an edge has the same effect as selecting the edge.  Just select all vertices that are connected to the edges that you want to select.  Out of curiosity, and also so that I can know if this information needs to be included with the tutorial because many other users are using 2.34; why not upgrade to 2.36?

:: becouse there doesn´t exist any precompiled binaries of 2.36 on the debian mirror servers.
:: In the meantime i´ve found out, that the downloadable packages from blender3d.org doasn´t need to be compiled - just copy them to the proper directory and start the executable. But nevertheless, Debian comes with a package management system called &quot;apt&quot; - which takes no notice about any software, installd &quot;by hand&quot;. This means it cannot consider that software for resolving pckage dependecies, which means that one day, when other software will be updated, especially libraries, blender might refuse to start or might not run stable.
:: However, i prefer using apt for the installation of software as far as possible.

:::I'm familiar with Debian, used that distro for awhile and now using [http://ubuntulinux.org Ubuntu].  I'm going to add instructions for using the latest blender on all linux distros on the first page so that we're all up to speed with the latest and greatest. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 18:42, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)


== Make Face Problems ==

Hi, I am using Blender 2.36 and if I want to &quot;repair&quot; the hole in the arms. After pressing the FKEY a Windows pops up &quot;Make FGON?&quot; If I press &quot;Make&quot; the Error message &quot;No Faces are selected to make FGON&quot; comes up.

What is wrong? Thank you for your help.
--AiRWOLF


I think the &quot;Make Face&quot; function only works on 3 or 4 vertices.  Try selecting only 4 at at time, to fill up gradually.  Also, make sure you have non-visible vertices non-selectable &quot;Limit Selection to Visible&quot; on your button bar, as it can pick up more than 4 if you think you just have 4.

'''Also:''' Make sure to remove doubled vertices... I had this problem and fixed it by hitting the '''WKEY''' and then selecting &quot;remove doubles&quot;.


FGON (fake N-Gon) only works when faces are selected, not vertices. As it's name implies, it fakes a N-Gon by hiding edges. --Jamin3D

== Problem following tutorial ==

Hello, so far the tutorial has gone great.  I think it is very well done. But at the point of extruding the arms to bend them upward I am stuck.  

I was able to delete the outer portion of the first arm (making a hole) and fixing it with the FKey.  I then use the vertex select mode and select the top four vertices of the outer arm and hit the EKey to extrude them.  

In your screenshots, at this point the model is shown sourounded in small cube bounding boxes, but mine is not. It looks just as it did in the previous screenshots of the tutorial, without the boxes.  

The problem is when I extrude the vertices they extude out at normals to the arm surface, getting further apart from each other. It doesn't look like it supposed to.

I am able to use Ctrl-Z to restore, but I can't get past this point.  

Please help a noobie figure out what I'm missing.

Thanks!

David.


:I can't really help you with the extrusion as mine went fine. But the boxes can easily be switched on 
:and off by the optimal button under the sub division option.
:All i did was select the top faces of the last &quot;box bit&quot; ,pressed EKey and chose region then held ctrl(PC)
:and choose the desired length of one box.
:Hope this is of any help,
:Sledz41

:: Thanks Sledz41!


::OP's right.  The containment box doesn't show up simply by pressing the &quot;Optimal Draw&quot;.  I had to hit last (2) buttons on the &quot;Subsurf&quot; bar (&quot;Enable modifier during interactive display&quot; and &quot;Enable modifier during Editmode&quot;).  That caused a new button to appear (&quot;Enable modifier to editing cage during Editmode&quot;) and when I hit THAT, I finally got my boxes back.  --RavinDave

== Blender 2.37a and this tutorial ==

I am using Blender 2.37a and have reached the point in the tutorial where the extended arm is cut off. Up to an including that point all went well. However &quot;mending&quot; the open end of the arm has stopped me. I can select the vertices at the arm's end, but hitting the space bar/edit/faces/make edge-face yields yet another choice (not mentioned in the tutorial). A small menu appears labeled &quot;FGon&quot; and wants me to choose &quot;make&quot; or &quot;clear.&quot; I choose &quot;make&quot; and get the error message: &quot;Error: No faces selected to make FGon.&quot; Does the tutorial need updating for v.2.376a? Or, what might I have done incorrectly? (Also the picture of the cutoff arm is a tube in a wireframe rectangular parallelopiped - my picture at that point is somewhat less simple but quite reasonable following the instructions - a minor point perhaps.) 

Any help or information will be appreciated.

Simm


I just had the same problem. The problem comes from a degenerated face. If you switch to face selection, you will notice a face that is on an edge. The solution i came up with was to juste delete the whole arm but its basis and redo it again. By carefully redoing the manipulation again (so without creating at some point this wrong face), it worked out well.

Psycho


I have a similar problem.  I've extruded the arms upward and resealed one elbow hole, but when I try to reseal the other one, the new face is flat instead of curving smoothly underneath the arm.  I can't think of anything I did differently on either arm.

[[User:JDspeeder1|JDspeeder1]]

PS. I figured it out, the problem arm is one &quot;cube&quot; too short between the shoulder and the elbow.

== Elbow Patch ==

I'm following this tutorial and I get to the part where you make the arms bend up. When I fix the hole in his elbow, he gets something resembling a patch on his elbow. Using blender 2.34

== Definition needed ==

The tutorial says &quot;Under KDE, CTRL+TAB changes desktop so you will have to use the statusline buttons instead.&quot;  What is KDE?

Is it this: [[Using KDE]] ?

I think it's telling you what to do if you have that KDE thingie.

:KDE is a graphical desktop environment for Linux and Unix workstations. (http://www.kde.org/)  CTRL+TAB must be a shortcut specific to that operating system, hence the warning note to users of KDE.

== Scaling with axis constraint section ==

:''Moved comment from book text''

I was rolling along nice until this section. Needs to be more clear and some of the new things you use aren't explained beyond, click button x. Mike, Aug 2, 2006

== Problem with FGon ==

Hello, I'm using Blender 2.41, I want to repair the hole in the arms. I select only four vertices, after pressing the FKEY a Window pops up says:  FGon: Make, Clear. When I press &quot;Make&quot; the Error message &quot;Didn't find FGon to create&quot; comes up.
What happens? Thanks for your help.

Update: this happens if you haven't deselected the four vertices that you have just used for extruding (so you actually have eigth vertices selected, four in the elbow and four in the &quot;hand&quot;). Perhaps a warning note could be added in the tutorial.

== Successfully completed this tutorial on 2006-09-20 ==

I completed this tutorial on 2006-09-20 using Blender 2.42a.  I only found one confusing thing that should be added/clarified.  About half way down the page you are instructed to change the ''Rotation/Scaling Pivot'' to 3D Cursor.  However, you are never instructed to change the ''Rotation/Scaling Pivot'' back to Median Point.  Everything seems fine until you try to do the scaling on the head.  If your pivot is still down at the hips then scaling the head won't work right.  Upon changing the pivot cursor back to Median Point the head will scale as described in the tutorial.  An instruction about this should be added at the appropriate place.  Also, the red text before the &quot;Modeling the arms&quot; section which says &quot;Screenshots and more specific instructions needed for this section.&quot; should possibly be removed (I think its old).  After working through that section I didn't have any problem understanding the directions and the screenshots were helpful and adequate.  (BTW, I am a beginner to Blender.)

== Picture problem still there. ==

Um, perhaps somebody decided to fix the problem of the pictures encroaching on the text right this moment, and deleted the discussion pertaining to that, or maybe not. Whatever the reason, ten seconds ago there was a discussion on the pictures covering the text and now it is gone, strangely, right after I replied to it. Anyway, it's still a problem.

: Oh, wait, I just messed it up, nevermind. Here it is. --[[User:207.6.170.68|207.6.170.68]] 01:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

some text ist covered by a picture, i can't read it. but i realized that everything looks perfectly right, if i choose a bigger fontsize. if you could try the same i would be thankful. i think this is a central problem of wikimedia projects: the pictures are somewhere else, belonging to your fontsize.
any ideas to fix it? i hope i could help you...

== Small issue with scaling ==
The tutorial says &quot;Note, you cannot scale along the Z-axis, as the current selection's Z-dimension is zero.&quot; Shouldn't it also point out that you can't scale on Y either, since the two selected edges are parallel on the z-plane? 

== Coordinate System ==
Is Y the depth in blender? Top view shows the Y axis going back in space? The coordinate system should be mentioned somewhere in the tutorial.

On the version of Blender that I have, 2.49a, a new scene is presented seen from the top, with y being up on the screen, x to the left and z toward the viewer. However, when we get to this part, the z is up, x is to the right and y points away from the viewer. This should be pointed out somewhere in the instructions to avoid confusion. - Bonapon

== My own small issue with the tutorial ==

So I just picked up this tutorial today, and when I reached the part about Modeling the arms, I wasn't able to figure out what this part meant. &quot;Before you begin, also uncheck '''the roundish button''' to make the arms into cubes again. You can change them back after you are done.&quot;  
Where specifically is this Roundish button, and is it even still in v2.44?

Thanks for the help in advance

== There many problems starting at &quot;Scaling section&quot; ==

I am having a lot of trouble pulling out of this page what I need to do make my model look like the example. It's way to embedded in the discussion. It's like this part is rushed. 

I would like to see a more recipe oriented step-wise approach. Either followed or proceeded by a general discussion of each of the steps. The way it is now leaves a lot to be desired. For instance at the start of each section it should be stated something to the effect &quot;In this section will do some ''task'' using the this ''technique''&quot;. From there either describe the general technique or techniques then give step by step instructions to accomplish said task or vice versa. We are noobs we need everything explained, or least I do.  

--[[User:Gilgamesh007|Gilgamesh007]] 19:39, 27 May 2007 (UTC)


I cannot follow this section.  It's not clear which three faces are being selected from either picture or text, but more importanntly when I precisely follow the directions the scaling does not produce the pictured result.  The three boxes simply push everything else aside instead of graduating into them.

== I can't find the manipulator hand icon. Is it important? ==
Under scaling with axis constraints.

I can't find this either. It also shows a five-fingered hand in the tutorial. No such icon appears when simply following the instructions in this tutorial. There is that one-finger icon though.

== Confusing newbie note ==

What does the Newbie Note mean? On the part where the arm is to be extruded upward, it says &quot;Newbie note: this looks more natural if you extrude 1 square using Rotate Manipulator Mode, and 2 squares using Scale Manipulator Mode.&quot;

What exactly is its effect? Natural in what way? There is no explanation... only that it &quot;looks more natural&quot;. I tried this and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Does manipulator mode affect extrusion at all? 

I think that newbie note only serves to further confuse readers. 

(Edit: very sorry about my comment on the article page itself. I have move my comment here. I was going to remove my comment from the main page and suddenly couldn't find it... Editor removal was almost instantaneous!)

I removed that note. [[Special:Contributions/84.49.71.107|84.49.71.107]] ([[User talk:84.49.71.107|talk]])

== Drawing the armpits ==

 We'll now use the 3D cursor instead of the selection's center: bring up the Mesh → Snap menu (SHIFT-SKEY) and select 
 Cursor → Selection (KEY4). This will move the 3D cursor to the location of the manipulator.

Mentioning &quot;KEY4&quot; as a shortcut seems like it would globally refer to &quot;cursor-&gt;selection&quot; while actually it refers
to &quot;select 4th item in the active menu&quot; if a menu is active, and &quot;show 4th layer&quot; if viewing 3d-window.
Either it should be mentioned earlier in the tutorial that numeric keys can be used to quick select menu items, or it should be given a sidenote on this page &quot;(KEY4 selects the item when the menu is active)&quot;. Just my opinion there, but I found it confusing for the all 5 seconds it took me to try out the alternative behaviors with different menus.

== comment removed from module ==

Hi, I'm Thomas, and I got stuck in the section with elbow. So, I selected those four vertices around the gap and pressed FKEY. A face covered this gap, I guess that's good ... but the elbow is not curved like in screenshots in this tutorial. The whole arm is like a cut cylinder, not smooth curve towards the top. Maybe that's not so important, but I feel like this new face is not connected to the whole object at all ... when I try to move it, only the face and its vertices move; arm stays untouched ( I mean, when I move this face, it detaches from the arm, arm is not bending like it should ).

Here is a link to my screenshot: http://i340.photobucket.com/albums/o324/tomalla5120x/Temporary/temp.jpg

Any ideas?

I can't do the first one..how do I get the white circle to where it is on the image?

== Pelvis widening? ==

When I first viewed ''Noob to Pro/Detailing Your Simple Person 2,'' I saw a section on widening the pelvis proportionately from the center. It no longer seems to be included in this page. Am I wrong? What happened to that section?[[User:Mtjlt|Mtjlt]] ([[User talk:Mtjlt|talk]]) 12:23, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

== Premade Model ==

I downloaded the premade model to make sure i did the previos tutorials right and noticed that the
premade model wasn't right! There are 8 double vertices and the pelvis is slightly deformed. Maybe
someone should make a new premade model. --[[Special:Contributions/174.1.138.178|174.1.138.178]] ([[User talk:174.1.138.178|talk]]) 05:49, 24 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''New Mexico Pork Tamales''' are a classic Southwestern United States meal, made from pork and chicken.  This version adds cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to outer masa flour of the tamale.

==Ingredients==
===Meat filling===
*1 cup shredded cooked [[Cookbook:Pork|pork ]]
*1 cup shredded cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken ]]
*1 (15 ounce - ~400g) can beanless chili con carne
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|cooking oil]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
*1 tablespoon garlic powder 
*2 teaspoons ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 

===Wrappers===
*1 (8 ounce - 230g) package of corn husks (contains about 100 husks)

===Masa mixture===
*2 pounds (900g) [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|Masa flour]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
*3 tablespoons chili powder
*3 tablespoons garlic powder
*1 tablespoon ground cumin
*2 tablespoons salt
*2 cups solid vegetable shortening
*8 cups warm [[Cookbook:Chicken_Stock#Chicken|chicken stock]] (or 8 cups water and 8 chicken bullion cubes)

==Procedure==
===Meat filling===
#Stir ingredients together and refrigerate until needed.

===Wrappers===
#Soak corn husks in warm water for at least two hours. A dinner plate may have to be used to hold corn husks under water.

===Masa mixture===
#Mix dry Masa flour with paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and salt. Mix well for even distribution of spices.
#Cut shortening into the Masa mixture with a pastry cutter. Mix until mixture resembles the texture of tiny peas.
#Slowly add chicken broth one cup at a time. Mix well with electric mixer. Mixture should resemble consistency of peanut butter.
#Continue mixing with electric mixer to incorporate air into batter. Mixture is ready to use when 1 teaspoon of batter floats on water.

===Filling and cooking tamales===
#Use one corn husk per tamale. Lay flat on table. The corn husk is roughly rectangle shaped.
#Spread 1/2 cup of Masa mixture on entire upward facing corn husk, leaving a 1 inch (2.5cm) gap along the long edge and narrow end of the corn husk. 
#Spread 1 tablespoon of meat mixture, in a narrow band in the middle, down the length of the masa spread corn husk.
#Roll/fold the husk along the wide edge, touching the edges of the masa together, with the meat mixture ending up in the middle of the masa. The part of the husk with the 1 inch gap with no masa should be rolled around the outside of the husk.
#Fold about 1 inch of end of rolled husk, upward along the body of the husk. (The narrow end with 1 inch masa gap). You should end up with something resembling a cornucopia, with one end folded over and one end open.
#Stand all of the rolled tamales on end in a steaming colander with the open end of the tamale facing upward.
#Steam the tamales over boiling water for 2 hours. Place a lid over the steaming colander. Keep the tamales above the boiling water, don't allow them to stand in it.
#At the end of the cooking period, open one tamale and make sure the masa is cooked and not doughy.
#Allow tamales to rest 30 minutes after cooking, before serving. This will help to keep the masa from sticking to the corn husk.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Makes about 50 to 75 tamales.
*Left over tamales may be frozen in zip lock bags.
*Reheat frozen tamales in a microwave. If you reheat by steaming, they may become soggy.

Electrical motors and generators are machines which either convert electrical energy inputs into forces or applied kinetic energy inputs into electrical energy. In principle, any electrical generator can also be operated as a motor and vice-versa. In practice they will often be optimized for one application or the other.

All electrical machines operate due the same principles derived from the study of electro-magnetics. Therefore, it is appropriate to first discuss these underlying electromagnetic concepts as this is crucial for understanding their operation. However, before discussing these concepts it will also be useful to revise the concepts of vector algebra and vector calculus which are used extensively in this subject.

== Vectors and Fields ==
The use of vectors and vector fields greatly simplifies the analysis of many electromagnetic (and indeed other) systems. Due to their usefulness, these concepts will be used extensively in this book. For this reason it will be useful to begin with a general treatment of the subject.

=== Vectors ===
A [[Wikipedia:Euclidean vector|vector]] is a quantitative which has both magnitude, direction and sense. The magnitude represents the vector's size or physical quantity. The direction represents the vector's position with respect to a reference axis. The sense represents the vector's orientation and it is represented by its arrow head. This contrasts with the definition of a [[Wikipedia:Scalar (physics)|scalar]] which has only magnitude. Examples of scalar quantities include temperature, resistivity, voltage and mass. In comparison, examples of vector quantities would include velocity, force, acceleration and position.

The most familiar and intuitive use of vectors is in the two-dimensional (x, y coordinates) or three-dimensional (x, y and z coordinates) Cartesian coordinate system.

=== Fields ===
The term ''field'' has a general meaning in mathematics and physics, but here we will be referring only to the special cases of [[Wikipedia:Scalar field|scalar]] and [[Wikipedia:Vector field|vector]] fields. Generally, a field is a region in space where the quantity in question, exist and its influence is being felt. A scalar field is a region of space in which each point is associated with a scalar value. A classic example of a scalar field is a temperature field in a heated block of material. 

If some heat source is applied to a cube of a conductive material, such as a metal, the temperature in the block will be highest where the heat source is applied, dropping off as we move away from the source in any direction. At every position inside the block a value could be assigned which is the temperature at this point. These temperature values make up the scalar temperature field in the block. It might be that it is possible to model accurately these values with some mathematical function, but the field itself is simply the variation in the scalar quantity in the space occupied by the block.

A vector field differs from a scalar field in that it has not only a magnitude at every position, but also ''direction''. A good example of a vector field is the velocity of the fluid flow in a winding river of changing width. Clearly at every point in the river, the velocity of the fluid will have a magnitude (the speed) which will be lower where the river is wide, and higher where the river is narrow. However, the flow will also have a direction which changes as the water is forced around the river bends. If we noted the fluid speed and direction everywhere in the river, the result would be a vector field of the fluid flow.

In addition to varying in space, fields can also vary in time. In the first example, if we started with a cold block and then applied the heat source, mapping the temperature field at set time intervals, it would be seen that the values of the temperature at every point would change as the heat conducted throughout the block over time. The result therefore is a scalar field that varies in the three dimensions of space and one of time.

== Magnetic Field Concepts ==
An electromagnetic field is a region of space in which electrical charges experience forces. The classical definition of the electromagnetic field is given by the following equation 

::::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E}+q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;P&gt;
What this equation states, is that an electrical charge of size {{math|q}} experiences a force when in the presence of an electric field denoted by {{math|'''E'''}}. Furthermore if the charge is moving, with velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, it will experience a further force if in the presence of a magnetic field denoted by {{math|'''B'''}}. Therefore the force on a electric charge ''defines'' what the electric and magnetic fields are in a given region of space. Without the presence of a charged particle it could never be known what their magnitudes or directions were.

== AC generators ==
* A very simple AC generator consists of a permanent magnet that rotates inside a coil in such a way that the N-pole and S-pole alternate as seen from the coil. An analog voltmeter (or rather a millivoltmeter?) that has its zero at the middle of the scale is connected to the ends of the coil. As the magnet is rotated the voltmeter moves first one way, then the other way. The speed of rotation determines the number of [[w:-cycle|&quot;cycles per second&quot;]], called Hertz(Hz). A rotation speed of 3000 revolutions per minute(RPM) produces 50 Hz, and 3600 RPM produce 60 Hz.
* The rotating permanent magnet can be replaced by another coil that is fed by DC and acts as an [[FHSST Physics Electromagnetism:Electromagnetism|electromagnet]]. Doubling the number of coils will double the number of, what is called &quot;the poles&quot;, and then only half the rotation speed is required for a given output frequency. 
*See also [[w:Alternator|Wikipedia: Alternator]]
AC generator works on the principle of Faraday's laws electro-magnetics.

== AC motors ==
AC motors are generally divided into two categories, induction and synchronous motors. The most common AC motor is the &quot;Squirrel cage motor&quot;, a type of induction motor. These have only one or more coils within which a special kind of mechanical rotor is free to rotate. There is no electrical connection to the rotor from the outside. The general formula to determine the synchronous speed of an induction motor is

&lt;math&gt;Speed = \frac{120f}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

For induction motors, this is a theoretical speed, even though it will never be obtained. The motor will always run slower than synchronous speed with a slip of S. If a motor were to be operated at full synchronous speed, the relative speed of the rotor to the stator would be 0, making it impossible to induce a voltage (Faraday's law) in the rotor windings. This in turn would make the flow of current impossible. Without current no magnetic field can be generated.

Most AC motors require a starter, or method of limiting the inrush current to a reasonable level. Types of motor starting include reactive (capacitor start and inductive start), and electronic (frequency drives and [[Power Electronics#Soft Starters | soft start drives]]). The reactive start method is usually used on fractional horsepower motors, and the electronic method is usually reserved for larger motors (cost of the drives is the main reason for this). Connecting these motors to computers, PLC's (programmable logic controllers), and interfacing with automation systems, is becoming more prevalent.

== DC Generators ==
DC generators are basically AC generators whose output voltage is switched the other way round at the proper moment, so that the direction of the voltage is always in a single direction. But the magnitude of the voltage keeps changing, just as it does in an AC generator, and it can be said that the output of a DC generator is DC plus a &quot;superimposed&quot; AC voltage, called &quot;ripple&quot;. Connecting a capacitor across the output terminals reduces that ripple.
See also [[w:Electrostatic generator|Wikipedia: &quot;Testatika&quot; Electrostatic generators]]

== DC Motors ==
Direct Current (DC) motors have a &quot;Commutator&quot; that switches the part of the coil that is closest to the poles at the time, more or less similar to the legendary &quot;donkey&quot; that tries to catch the carrots, but never succeeds. See [[GCSE Science/The motor effect|the very simplified commutator shown in blue]].

Usually a commutator has many &quot;segments&quot;, as many as there are taps on the coil. Starting a DC motor requires often an external resistor or rheostat to limit the current. The value, in Ohms, of that resistor is reduced in steps as the speed of the motor increases, until finally that resistor is removed from the circuit as the motor reaches close to its final speed.

==Single Phase Alternating Current==
===From a wire in a magnetic field to the Mains/line power source===
Basically an electric voltage is generated in a wire if either that wire is in a &lt;u&gt;changing&lt;/u&gt; magnetic field, or if the wire is moved into or out of a magnetic field. '''Single phase''' Alternating voltage (and '''Alternating Current''' if there is something connected to that wire or coil) is produced when a magnet, or magnet equivalent, is rotated inside a coil of wire. The more turns of wire there are in that coil, the higher the [[voltage]], and the faster the rotation, the higher the [[Wikipedia:frequency|frequency]]. If a graph would be drawn showing the relation of the  voltage at the terminals of the coil with time, then that graph would be of sinusoidal shape, alternating between positive (+''V''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) and negative (&amp;minus;''V''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) in a complete rotation. If the coil would be rotated at a speed of 3000 revolutions per minute, then there would be 3000/60=50 cycles per second (= 50 Hz), the unit's name being Hertz (Hz), and if the coil would be rotated at 3600 revolutions per minute then the voltage would change at a [[Wikipedia:frequency|frequency]] of 60 Hz. The usual AC (mains or line) frequency is 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the country concerned.


The electrical power available in North American homes is single phase 60 Hertz 120 volts.  AC current's advantage over DC current is the efficient transmission over long distances using step-up and step-down transformers.
*Note that [[Electronics/Transformers|3-phase transformer]]s are, in fact, 3 '''single-phase''' transformers whose voltages are 120 degrees displaced from the other two, and that any terminal of a [[Electronics/Transformers|3-phase transformer]]  versus the neutral terminal (shown as '''N''' below) has a single phase voltage. A building's load could, for example, be divided into three separate single-phase loads, more or less equal to one another; these loads would be supplied from a three-phase transformer, all three voltages being versus the neutral terminal; that terminal is usually connected to ground/earth. 


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:240120SinglePhaseWaveform.gif]] --&gt;


120 volts is the root mean square (&lt;math&gt;V_{rms}&lt;/math&gt;) of the maximum voltage (&lt;math&gt;V_{max}&lt;/math&gt;) .


&lt;math&gt;V_{rms} = \frac {V_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;V_{max} = V_{rms} \cdot \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;V_{max} = 120\ volts \cdot 1.414 = 170\ volts&lt;/math&gt;

==Wikibooks World History and Maps==
Hello. I've been working on a series of world history maps, many of which are uploaded to Wikimedia commons on my [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Talessman/Maps Talessman Maps] page, and on [http://www.worldhistorymaps.info www.WorldHistoryMaps.info]. I would like to contribute to Wikibooks: World History, and was told I should contact you. Respectfully, [[User:Talessman|talessman]] ([[User talk:Talessman|talk]]) 07:37, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

I have recently taken the AP World History exam and revived a 5(In addition to 800 on the SAT test), I think I could help this project.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] flour
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] baking powder
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] sugar
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] salt
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] soy milk
*vegetable oil

==Procedure==
{| style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 242px; border: #99B3FF solid 1px&quot;
| {{Vegan recipe}}
|}
#Mix all dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.
#Mix soy milk into the dry ingredients.
#Heat a griddle until water sprinkled on it quickly evaporates. Spread a thin film of oil on the griddle.
#Pour pancake batter on griddle to form 4- to 5-inch circles. Bubbles should start forming.
#When the underside is light brown, flip the pancake.
#When the other side is light brown, serve.

==Variations==
*Banana pancakes: add one well mashed banana to the batter.
*Chocolate pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] chocolate chips to the batter.
*Walnut pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] roughly chopped walnuts to the batter.
*Cranberry pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dried cranberries to the batter.

Any of the above ingredients can be mixed together.

==Notes==
* Don't over mix! Over mixing will produce gluten; this will inhibit rising and make the pancakes rubbery.
* Optionally, you can serve your pancakes with syrup or jam.
* Substituting rice milk for soy milk may make the pancakes fall apart more easily.

==The Scramble for Africa==
Starting in the late 1800s, the nations of Europe began to take a huge interest in colonizing Africa.  The discovery of quinine, an effective vaccine against malaria allowed European explorers to crisscross the continent in the 1870s and 1880s.  In the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, the European nations divided up the continent among themselves, without taking into account the preexisting African boundaries.  By 1914, almost all of Africa, with the exception of Liberia and Ethiopia, was under the control of one of the European powers.

==The Germans==
===German East Africa===
On March 3, 1885, the German government announced that it had gone wild and got wet
 an imperial charter (secretly, on February 17) to Carl Peters' company, and intended to establish a protectorate in East Africa. Peters then recruited a variety of specialists who fanned out across the country, south to the Rufiji River and north to Witu, near Lamu on the coast.

The Germans quickly established their rule over Bagamoyo, Dar es Salaam and Kilwa. The Abushiri Revolt started in 1888 and was put down (with British help) in the following year. In 1890, London and Berlin concluded the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, a deal that gave Heligoland to Germany, and defined the limits of German East Africa (the exact borders remained ill-defined until 1910).

Through a series of alliances with Native Tribes, the Germans expanded their colonies. German colonial administrators relied heavily on native chiefs to keep order and collect taxes. Other than local police, garrisons of Schutztruppe soldiers at Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Iringa and Mahenge consisted on 1 January 1914 of 110 German officers (including 42 medical officers), 126 non-commissioned officers and 2,472 local soldiers.

General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, a vibrant and young officer, he spent the war harrying the forces of the British Empire, tying down with his band of 3,000 Europeans &amp; 11,000 native Askaris and porters, a British/Imperial army 300,000 strong, which was at times commanded by the former Second Boer War commander Jan Smuts. One of his greatest victories was at the Battle of Tanga (3–5 November, 1914), where he beat a British force more than eight times the size of his own. Lettow-Vorbeck's masterful mix of guerrilla warfare and daring raids ended up costing the British war effort massive resources and upwards of 60,000 casualties. Nonetheless, weight of numbers, especially after forces coming from Belgian Congo had attacked from the West, and dwindling supplies, forced Lettow-Vorbeck into a grudging withdrawal, shortly before the agreed cease-fire.

==The Belgians==

===The Congo===
Belgium itself had only been independent since 1830. King Leopold II tried to interest his government in establishing colonies but it lacked the resources to develop the candidate territories and turned down his plans.

During the Berlin West Africa Conference(1884-1885) the area of the Congo was granted to the Belgians. Leopold originally ruled it personally, as his own private property. He immediately began to exploit its valuable resources. However, it was at the cost of the African Laborers. Leopold's regime was absolutely brutal. African laborers who did not preform well enough were often pushied by having their hands cut off. In 1904 the ''Casement Report'' was released. It told the grim tales of killings, mutilation, kidnapping and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement. Leopold offered to reform his regime, but few took him seriously. All nations were now agreed that the King's rule must be ended as soon as possible, but no nation was willing to take on the responsibility. The Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration on November 15, 1908, four years after the Casement Report and six years after the first printing of Heart of Darkness.

When the Belgian Government took over the Administration from King Leopold II, the situation in the Congo improved marginally. Belgians were largely ambivalent towards the colony, so it suffered from a vacillatory governance. Because of this attitude, Belgium was usually a decade behind other colonial powers in its methods of governance, and was surprised when the Congo moved towards independence in the 1950's. Political administration fell under the total and direct control of the coloniser; there were no democratic institutions. The head of the state remained the King of the Belgians (who, already at the time, no longer had any political influence). The Belgian government controlled the country, but day-to-day operations were carried out by the governor general. 

Following the Léopoldville riots in March 1959 and Kasavubu's incarceration, 1959 initially saw the legalization of all Congolese political parties, followed by general elections throughout the Congo. In 1960, the Round Table of Brussels was convened and occurred between January 20 and February 20. Congolese representatives and Belgians set the stage for nationwide elections later in the year. The Belgian Congo achieved independence on June 30, 1960 under the name &quot;Republic of Congo&quot; or &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot;.

===Ruanda-Urundi===
In the First World War, the area was conquered by forces from the Belgian Congo in 1916. The Treaty of Versailles divided German East Africa with the vast majority known as Tanganyika going to Great Britain but the westernmost portion to Belgium, this area was formally referred to as the Belgian Occupied East African Territories. In 1924, they became Ruanda-Urundi when the League of Nations issued a formal mandate that granted Belgium full control over the area.

The Belgians demanded that the territories earn profits for the motherland and any development had to come out of funds gathered in the territory. These funds mostly came from the extensive cultivation of coffee in the region's rich volcanic soils. The populace was also extensively taxed and forced to perform corvée labor. 

After the League of Nations was dissolved the region became a United Nations trust territory in 1946. This included the promise that the Belgians would prepare the areas for independence, but the Belgians felt the area would take many decades to ready for self rule.

Independence came largely as a result of actions elsewhere. In the 1950s an independence movement arose in the Belgian Congo, and the Belgians became convinced they could no longer control the territory. In 1960, Ruanda-Urundi's larger neighbor gained its independence. After two more years of hurried preparations the colony became independent on July 1, 1962, broken up along traditional lines as the independent nations of Rwanda and Burundi. It took two more years before the government of the two became wholly separate.

==The Dutch==

===Suriname===
Suriname had been a Dutch colony since 1667. The Dutch planters relied heavily on African slaves to cultivate the coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Treatment of the slaves by their owners was notoriously bad, and many slaves escaped the plantations. 

Slavery was abolished by the Netherlands in Suriname in 1863, but the slaves in Suriname were not fully released until 1873, after a mandatory 10 year transition period during which time they were required to work on the plantations for minimal pay and without state sanctioned torture. As a plantation colony, Suriname was still heavily dependent on manual labor, and to make up for the shortfall, the Dutch brought in contract laborers from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) and India (through an arrangement with the British). In addition, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, small numbers of mostly men were brought in from China and the Middle East.

In 1954, the Dutch placed Suriname under a system of limited self-government, with the Netherlands retaining control of defense and foreign affairs. In 1973, negotiations started with the Dutch government leading towards full independence, which was granted on November 25, 1975. The severance package was very substantial, and a large part of Suriname's economy for the first decade following independence was fueled by foreign aid provided by the Dutch government.

===The East Indies===
The Dutch East India Company (VOC) had been set up in the early seventeenth century to maximize Dutch trade interests in the Malay archipelago. By 1700, a colonial pattern was well established; the VOC had grown to become a state-within-a-state and the dominant power in the archipelago. Its method of indirect rule was to survive it. After the bankrupt company was liquidated on January 1, 1800, its territorial possessions became the property of the Dutch government.

In an 1811 to 1816 interregnum, during the Napoleonic Wars, the British took over administration of several Dutch East Indies posts including Java before Dutch control was restored. The 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, ceded Dutch control of Malacca, the Malay Peninsula, and possessions in India to Britain in exchange for British settlements in Indonesia, such as Bengkulu in Sumatra. Batavia remained the capital of the colony. 
[[Image:Evolution of the Dutch East Indies.png|thumb|300px|Dutch Expansion in the East Indies]]
For most of the Dutch East Indies history, and that of the VOC before it, Dutch control over these territories was tenuous; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become the boundaries of modern-day Indonesia. Although Java was under Dutch domination for most of the 350 years of the combined VOC and Dutch East Indies era, many areas remained independent for much of this time including Aceh, Lombok, and Borneo.

There were numerous wars and disturbances across the archipelago as various indigenous Indonesian groups resisted efforts to establish a Dutch hegemony, which weakened Dutch control and tied up its military forces. In the seventeenth century the VOC had used its superior arms, and Buginese (from Sulawesi) and Ambonese (from Maluku) mercenaries to expand and protect its trading interests across the archipelago. During the Dutch East Indies era, the most prolonged conflicts were the Padri War in Sumatra (1821–38), the Java War (1825–30) led by Prince Diponegoro, and a bloody thirty-year war in Aceh.

Disturbances continued to break out on both Java and Sumatra during the remainder of the 19th century, and between 1846 and 1849, expeditions to conquer Bali were largely unsuccessful. The Banjarmasin War in south east Borneo resulted in the Dutch defeat of the sultan. In Aceh, guerrilla leaders fought off Dutch invasion in what was the longest and bloodiest conflict from 1873 to Acehnese surrender in 1908. As exploitation of Indonesian resources expanded off Java, most of the outer islands came under direct Dutch government control or influence. Significant Indonesian piracy remained a problem for the Dutch until the mid-19th century.

Southwestern Sulawesi was occupied in 1905–06, the island of Bali in 1906, and the Bird's Head Peninsula (West Papua), was brought under Dutch administration in 1920. The invasion and occupation of Indonesia during World War II, brought about the destruction of the colonial state in Indonesia, as the Japanese removed as much of the Dutch state as they could, replacing it with their own regime. Although the top positions were held by the Japanese, the internment of all Dutch citizens meant that Indonesians filled many leadership and administrative positions. Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, nationalist leaders Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence. After a 4 year war, in which the Dutch re-occupied most of the colony, Indonesia was granted independence on December 27, 1949 due largely to international pressure. 

In 1949, when the rest of the Dutch East Indies became fully independent as Indonesia, the Dutch retained sovereignty over western New Guinea, and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. Some five thousand teachers were flown there. The Dutch put an emphasis upon political, business, and civic skills. Indonesia attempted to invade the region on December 18, 1961. Following some skirmishes between Indonesian and Dutch forces an agreement was reached and the territory was placed under United Nations administration in October 1962 It was subsequently transferred to Indonesia in May 1963. The territory was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.

== Updating this template ==

Just in the interest of trying to keep a good thing going, I have on my own been updating this template for the past several months (June-August 2005).  If you think something else ought to go here, feel free to change this template, especially if it is out of date.  If we need to start ''voting'' on these articles, go ahead and do that too, but when I took over it had already been several months since the original implementation, and that was for an article of the ''week'', which IMHO was too short of a period of time for Wikibooks to even look at.

I have noticed that the articles that get focus do get some increased activity in terms of people adding some more content, so this is proving to be of some value.  Keep in mind that you (especially if you have been able to even find this talk page) are just as valid in your opinions on this subject as anybody else.  Have fun and help Wikibooks as well. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:01, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

I've been updating these for a few months now. But I'd like some other opinions, as I'm really just selecting articles that are interesting to me and need work. Does anyone else have any suggestions for December or an idea for a less arbitrary process?

I'm also thinking about tagging articles of the month with a banner. Does anyone have any opinions about that? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 12:16, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Weight: does it mean mass or force? ==
Please also see other discussions on this topic at 
and
[[Wikipedia:Weight]]
and
[[User:Kernigh/pound]].


== Renewing perspective ==

I was going to step back for a while to see what came of people's contributions other than mine or from Metric1000, but then thought something I wrote elsewhere might help:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I'd say that as most of us aren't practising scientists we don't use the word 'mass' that much in our everyday life on Earth...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If so, I reckon young people must use the word 'mass' even less - I probably didn't use it until I started studying science as physics, chemistry and biology - so why don't we write this module from the point of view of your 'weight' - i.e. that thing you measure when you step onto the bathroom scale - changing from one planet etc to the next, whilst you don't (unless, say, you go on a diet or start bingeing)? Then say the &quot;stuff&quot; that goes to make up you (or anything else) is what you may've heard people refer to as 'mass' (especially scientists) so although your or something else's 'mass' remains the same from planet to planet or the like (so long as you don't diet or binge etc) your 'weight' changes. Why does your 'weight' change? Enter a little about gravity. Well, something along those lines and not necessarily in that order.

Potentially much simpler and I don't think it need compromise the situation we have here on Earth where most (adult) people use the words 'weight' and 'mass' interchangeably.

:How is this a weight point-of-view if you still mention mass and gravity? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 20:41, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
:: Sorry not to be more clear; I was writing in more of a stream-of-consciousness manner than usual. What I mean is start the module from something young people are likely to've experienced, viz. that measurement called 'weight' given to you by a bathroom scale. This is certainly a measurement that would produce a different result when tried on the Moon, Mars, etc. Then move on to contrast that with what doesn't change, viz. your mass. Then touch on gravity to indicate why there's a difference. [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 23:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Suppose you have a fishing line that will break if a force of 50 newtons is applied to it.  With that, you should be able to lift a 5 kilogram catfish out of the river on Earth.
:::Now, suppose you put your boat out on the Sea of Tranquility.  That line will still break if a force of 50 newtons is applied to it.  But now you should be able to lift a 31 kg catfish out of the &quot;Sea&quot; with that line.
:::Then, cut out a couple of steaks, throw them on the fire, and toss on a handful of green cheese as it gets warm!  &quot;Oooohh, sooo good!&quot;  Or maybe that belongs in the Cookbook namespace? [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:45, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:That doesn't work at all.  &quot;Your weight&quot; DOES NOT CHANGE as that term is used by professionals in the medical sciences, nor even as it is used in sports such as the Olympic weight classes (63 kg, etc.) for judoka, boxers, wrestlers, and the like.  Do you suppose you could calculate for us how much difference there was in weightlifting in the mass of a 20 kg &quot;weight&quot; at the Helsinki Olympics and the mass of a 20 kg &quot;weight&quot; at the Mexico City Olympics?

:I agree, we do not often use the word &quot;mass&quot; in our everyday lives.  But that doesn't mean we are unfamiliar with the concept.  We do indeed '''very often''' use the quantity which physicists or astronomers call by the name ''mass'' in their own jargon.  We simply call it by the name we had already been using for hundreds of years before anybody ever used the word ''mass'' with that meaning:  we call it ''weight''.

:Like I said before, you '''can choose not to call this quantity weight''.  But that is your only option.

:It is not a legitimate, viable alternative to continue to call it ''weight'', but to misapply a definition of that ambiguous word which is inappropriate to the context. 

:People have long known that it is harder to push a &quot;heavy&quot; boat away from the dock than it is to push a &quot;light&quot; boat away from the dock.  That is one everyday way in which people have experienced the effects of mass in a way mostly unrelated to the pull of gravity, something we as a people have been familiar with for thousands of years. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 20:51, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

Please, Metric1000, this is a module in a book meant for young people. I hope you'd agree that 'weighing' yourself on a bathroom scale is something young people are likely to've encountered (unlike the notion of Olympic weight classes, changes in 'weight' due to altitude, etc) and your 'weight' as given by such a scale &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; change if you 'weighed' yourself using it on the Moon, Mars, etc. Perhaps you'd prefer to say something like &quot;the reading has changed&quot; as if something else hasn't, but &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; other than 'mass' would that &quot;something else&quot; be?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I agree, we do not often use the word &quot;mass&quot; in our everyday lives.  But that doesn't mean we are unfamiliar with the concept...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My point at the start of this thread is to suggest that most young people &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; unlikely to've linked the word 'mass' with the concept of 'amount of matter'. I'm sorry if you don't think that's clear.

[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 23:05, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, of course, it works the other way as well.  You don't have to call it ''mass''; you can use the familiar synonym ''weight'' instead.
:But you still can't apply the wrong meaning to it, and say or even imply that ''the students' weight'' would change.
:Your bathroom spring scale just won't quite work right on another planet.  Maybe you could paste on a new dial with the readings we want.  If your tool is broken, fix it.
:It's much like astronauts weighing themselves in a &quot;weightless&quot; environment.  None of our normal scales work at all.  So they had to find a different tool.  (What they do is set a spring in motion, and time its oscillations as they ride on it.)
:Note also another problem with those spring scales, even if what you want to measure is force.  Suppose you have one whose dial makes a full circle with 300 lb on it on Earth.  Then our 86 lb student will deflect this scale by about 103 degrees of arc.  But on the moon, that deflection will only be 17 degrees of arc.  The springs are too stiff to get much deflection at all.  On Pluto it would be much worse; only about 6 degrees of arc.  The springs are just too stiff to work very well for this purpose in those environments.  
:So if you have to change springs anyway, you might as well fix the dial at the same time, to get a good reading of mass in the location in which it will be used. [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:30, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Or, just choose the new springs with a spring constant that will work with the old dial in the new environment.  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Yes, of course, it works the other way as well.  You don't have to call it ''mass''; you can use the familiar synonym ''weight'' instead. But you still can't apply the wrong meaning to it, and say or even imply that ''the students' weight'' would change...&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You hang something from a spring on Earth and the spring extends. I say that this extension indicates weight. Do you?&lt;/br&gt;
You hang the same thing from the same spring on the Moon and the spring extends, but not to the same length as when on Earth. Do you agree?&lt;/br&gt;
I say that this extension indicates weight. It is not the same length as the extension when on Earth, so I say the weight it indicates is not the same as that on Earth. In other words, I say the weight has changed.  

Weight changes when gravity changes. Mass doesn't change when gravity changes.

We need to come to some agreement on this. Anything else is and has been distraction.

Just don't use units like kilograms as units of weight.  That is the main thing Metric1000 and I have been saying.  The implication is that most science museums that have you step on a scale and see what you would weigh on the Moon or Jupiter (I've seen it) is completely unrealistic and attempts to suggest that your mass changes when you go to different planets.  That doesn't happen at all and is the whole point of this article and the &quot;myth buster&quot; that we are trying to cover.  The fine point that is a source of contention is that pounds-force is sometimes used to describe weight and used as a demonstration for how much your weight would change in a different gravitational field.  Pounds are used for both mass and force calculations.  This is most painfully demonstrated with the calculation of units for specific impulse of a rocket, which is measured in pound-seconds/pound, and usually just reported as seconds of specific impulse.  Unfortunately, this is actually pound(force)-seconds/pound(mass), so this isn't really proper reduction of units.  SI units for the same concept is N-s/kg, which shows more clearly how that is a false concept for seconds of impulse.  Specific impulse, BTW, is the measurement of the effeciency of a rocket engine and a way to compare how powerful one engine type is compared to another rocket design. Rocket scientists know about this unit screwup, but most scientific literature uses this corrupted unit of measurement anyway, even outside the USA.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:33, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

:Your &quot;myth buster&quot; is completely out of place in a '''Solar System''' book. It's way way off topic. This is '''not''' the place to be arguing over units for mass and weight, even if the subject wasn't '''unitless''' in the first place. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:19, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

::It is not ''off topic'' but indeed is the very topic that is the subject of this section.  This section was added to this Wikibook because it was felt that there were some &quot;special topics&quot; that covered all of the planets and would be endlessly repeated over and over again for each seperate planet.  This is indeed done with other Wikijunior books as well, so it is not a unique circumstance.  I will agree that this Wikimodule is a train wreck right now in terms of having it flow throughout the whole article.  It needs to change and that is apparent.  All I'm trying to do is to make a compromise that would be acceptable to everybody, and to point out what effect a change in gravity can have.  This is something hard to grasp, which is precisely why we seem to be having all of this argument right now.  I don't think a &quot;unitless&quot; relative comparison of each planet's acceleration at the surface is going to work out for kids.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Heh. It's on-topic for a section that is off-topic for the book. In other words, the subject matter matches the page but the page does not belong in this book. This isn't a physics book. It doesn't cover the math of orbiting bodies in space, does it? (I sure hope not) I think the proper place for this page is [[VfD|here]]. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:42, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

== ditch the units ==

This is silly. The use of unnecessary units for unitless values is bad,
even if we didn't have to deal with poundforce and such. Probably this
page should just be deleted.

Do like this:

'''People on Endor are pulled down with 1.23456 times as much force as they would be on Earth.'''

That's the number you need if you want to take your weight, in ''any''
system of units, and multiply it by something to get a feel for the
difference. It works for any loose idea of stones, pounds, newtons, grams,
slugs, etc.

If you decide to get all scientific, you can argue about units for   
''acceleration'', not force. Acceleration of gravity on Earth is 20/7
rods/microfortnight/microfortnight.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:This is exactly what I've done, if you look at the section &quot;How does gravity change what happens?&quot;, I put relative gravitational pull that is merely a comparison to that of the Earth.  BTW, I love both rods as length and microfortnights as a unit of time.  I even worked on a computer operating system (VMS) that used microfortnights as the internal clock measurement for system accounting purposes.  Only later did I catch the joke there, however.  Windows NT also used fortnights as a unit of measurement because after a fortnight of running continuously the OS would crash from an internal overflow bug in the system clock. (actually about 39.5 days of running, but that is close enough to a fortnight for this purpose.) --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:15, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Which is correct?
::*a.  The Earth's atmosphere is 75.5% nitrogen.
::*b.  The Earth's atmosphere is 78.1% nitrogen.
::The answer, of course, is both.  It depends on what is being compared to get these dimensionless ratios.  It is 78.1% by volume (and probably the same,  or very close to it, on an [[w:amount of substance]] basis).  It is 75.5% by weight (the terminology often used in science as well as in our everyday lives, though some scientists will insist on using the equivalent phrase &quot;by mass&quot;).
::The dimensionless ratio for &quot;my weight&quot; on Mars compared to &quot;my weight&quot; on Earth is 1.00.
::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] is presumably well aware that if his phrasing is used, a good number of teachers are going to be telling their students that his 1.23456 number is the ratio for their &quot;weight&quot;.   [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 13:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Great, so you agree with me? If not, well, I'm not seeing a complaint. We can perfectly well say &quot;78.1% by volume&quot;, &quot;75.5% by weight&quot;, or &quot;75.5% by mass&quot;. Probably the &quot;by X&quot; part belongs in a footnote though. We can perfectly well say that the 1.23456 number is for weight. While we could equivalently say that it is for acceleration, we'd best not make things needlessly complicated in the '''Wikijunior Solar System''' book. Never lose sight of the subject matter of this book. This is not the '''Wikijunior Newtonian Physics''' or '''Wikijunior SI Measurement''' book.

== the gravitational force of me on the Earth ==

The module currently claims

''For instance, the Earth is very massive and pulls on you very strongly. When you jump up, it quickly pulls you back down to the ground. You are also pulling on the Earth — but your mass is tiny compared to the Earth, so your pull on the Earth is tiny too.''

That seems incorrect. Aren't these 2 forces exactly equal and opposite?

Rather than fixing this example to make it true, but confusing, perhaps we could pick a more appropriate example -- perhaps compare the pull of the earth on you to the pull of a bowling ball on you ? Or the pull of the earth on a bowling ball to the pull of you on a bowling ball? Or the pull of, say, the International Space Station on an astronaut clambering on its outside to the pull of the earth on that same astronaut at the same time?
(Even though that astronaut is nearly &quot;weightless&quot;, his mass is the same as when he is walking on earth, and the force due to Earth's gravity is nearly the same as when he is walking on earth).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:11, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:It is interesting that the term &quot;weightless&quot; is being depreciated for internal use by NASA and other space science researchers.  The ''new'' term that is more commonly used is '''microgravity''', to suggest that gravitational fields do exist in orbital environments, but that the acceleration effects are essentially insignificant in term of the calculations in the experiments.  The ISS does indeed have a gravitational pull on objects around it, but only equivalent of a small asteroid of the same size, roughly, being about 100 meters from one end to the other.  The ISS has high mass density components (like titanium and steel) but also has some interesting structure that would make for some interesting gravitational effects.  This is also supposedly one reason (the huge size of the ISS) why many science researchers are claming that the ISS is useless for some critical experiements:  It is so large that the gravity from the station itself starts to become a factor.  I am not kidding here either.

:BTW, in regards to your question above, when you jump up on the Earth, you pull the Earth back toward you as well as pulling you toward the Earth.  I guess it is a matter of perspective, but the whole Earth does indeed move just a little bit toward you when you come back down.  Maybe the distance is the diameter of a proton, but it is something that is technically measureable.  This is also just a matter of point of view, where both are valid points of view in trying to determine which is correct.  I'm talking scientific point of view, not political point of view here.  Relativity vs. discussions of relatives. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:07, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

== Alternate approach to this module ([[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About gravity and weight]]) ==

This module is indeed a &quot;train wreck&quot; and I am beginning to wonder if it is or will cause more trouble than it's worth. As it stands currently I feel it is out of kilter with the rest of the book, is too long, over-tabulated and introduces more words and concepts than it explains - some of which surely must be inappropriate for the intended audience (e.g. &quot;Astronomerese&quot;).

However, in the spirit of trying to be constructive, I've created [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|an alternate version of this module]] which:

# Tries to stay simple and succinct (although I realise there's room for improvement, e.g. shorter sentence lengths, fewer subclauses, etc);
# Does not refer to mass;
# Does not refer to units;
# Does not &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; that weight changes, but rather that (underline emphases added):
:: &quot;You may've read or heard people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y that your weight would be different on the Moon...&quot;;
:: &quot;[the bathroom scale] would &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y you weighed less than when you weighed yourself with it on the Earth. So people &lt;u&gt;sa&lt;/u&gt;y your weight has changed...&quot;
:: &quot;it's &lt;u&gt;as if&lt;/u&gt; ... you have no weight...&quot;

If people think this approach is a starter then I think a couple of illustrations or diagrams and perhaps a table of what a bathroom scale would say you weighed on other planets would add interest to the page.

I hope this helps.

== Changed approach to this module ==

I have edited this module. Unlike with the alternate module, I intend to use the word mass. (Notice that &quot;mass&quot; is in the title of this module.) The intention of my edits was to improve the introduction of kilograms and newtons as mass and force (of gravity).

I did remove the references to scientists thinking that &quot;weight&quot; should be force, and astronomers thinking that they should always use the metric/SI system. I also reworded the introduction in a way so that it introduces SI kilograms and newtons, but never introduces pounds; this might need to be changed. (There was never any introduction to stones.)

I also placed the sections about inertia into comments. (The sections did not use the word &quot;inertia&quot;, but referred to difficulty in starting and stopping objects.) Inertia is probably too much for this module. Remember that this is a module that ignores all forces other than gravity; it never introduces the idea, for example, of a force for a person to lift a heavy object. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:07, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== Pluto ==

Pluto is a ''really bad example'' of forces. For one thing, we don't really know all that much about Pluto. It's better for this purpose, to use something more familiar, perhaps the Moon. Or maybe Mars or Venus. The Moon is probably best, because we see it so often, it's ''close.'' And people have actually walked on it

I've edited much of the article before the section that brings up Pluto. I've made the language use &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; instead of &quot;you.&quot; It's more effective, speaking with kids and giving examples of things that humans experience, to not speak to them as if they or we were aliens. &quot;You may fall when you jump, but I only fall if I want to.&quot;

I'm only guessing, I haven't looked yet, and don't have time right now, but I suspect that this may be an issue through the whole book. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 17:26, 10 September 2010 (UTC)

Checking out that Pluto thing, I found out what happened. May 1, 2008, the page was hit by a vandal, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/216.180.4.34 216.180.4.34]. It wasn't noticed. The next day, the page was again vandalized. That was noticed, and it was reverted. Back to the vandalized version, which was more subtle vandalism. The same editor had been frequently reverting vandalism to the article, but may never have read the whole article. Happens. Anyway, there used to be a full table, which was removed that day in 2008. I'll restore it. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 01:12, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

== The table ==

The table claims that you could kick a ball fast enough to escape the gravity of Phobos. However, several calculations there may have been off for Phobos. Or not. It gets complicated because Phobos is small, and, in general, for small values of how high you could toss a ball, compared to the radius of the planet or moon, if the gravity is cut in half, you can toss it twice as high. But as the speed with which you can toss it increases, and you approach escape velocity, the ball will go higher than just that ratio, until when you reach escape velocity, it would never fall back. I did some searching on this and found sources that confirmed should be easy to throw a baseball with more than escape velocity on Phobos, so it would indeed go into orbit around Mars. But I'm not sure at all about the statements of how high one could jump. It's not a simple calculation from the force of gravity, and I don't have time to do the math and make sure I get it right. So where I left the page may be quite imperfect. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 02:52, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

== Page strategy, and gravity on the moon ==

There's a misleading passage in the current revision of the page (as of this writing).  I'll try my hand at fixing it if someone else doesn't beat me to it (which, let's face it, they might).

We want, I think, a clear and engaging explanation of the major elements of the law of universal gravitation, by going unhurriedly through the sequence
* mass is how much material;
* gravity at a given distance is proportional to the mass of both objects, so at equal distances from the Moon and the Earth, the Moon's gravity is only 1/81 as much as the Earth's; and
* gravity is much stronger (inverse square) when you're closer, so since the moon is much smaller than the Earth, putting you almost four (three and two thirds) times closer to it when you're on its surface than when you're on the Earth's surface, that makes up for a lot of the smaller mass of the Earth.
If there's a reason why that wouldn't work, it's probably that the details get too esoteric, at about the time one has to qualify the second point by saying that it's at the same distance; but that can probably be finessed successfully.

Right now, the progression from point two to point three seems to be a bit rushed, and the part about equal distance isn't clear when point two is made, so that it comes out sounding as if you'd weigh 1/81 as much on the surface of the moon, instead of three and two thirds squared times that.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:32, 11 September 2010 (UTC)

:Thanks. I think I fixed it. I wasn't trying to generate a mathematical calculation, except for two relationships: the force of gravity between two objects varies directly with the mass of either object, i.e., double either and the force doubles. Half either and the force halves. And then I added to the article the inverse square relationship, that may be within reach of the target age, at least some of the kids. If this were a physics page, I'd go into a lot more detail, it is actually not difficult to explain why you get an inverse square law with various phenomena. See how you like what I did. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 00:58, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

::That does seem to fix the problem, yes.
::I appreciate that getting drawn into details on WJ can be a slippery slope.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:19, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

Yeah. The trick is to write things that are correct when seen from a more informed perspective, but that also convey simple truths without unnecessary complications. Looking above, there has been a huge flap over &quot;weight.&quot; The problem is that the word &quot;weight,&quot; in ordinary usage, means two different things. It is used to refer to the force applied, and it is used to refer to mass. Good pedagogy starts from what kids already know, and it leads them from that into wider understanding. So demands above that units of weight not be used had completely lost the purpose.
*Kids know that it is harder to throw a heavier object than a lighter one. This isn't an effect of gravity, it's an effect of mass. It is just as hard to throw a baseball on the moon (and we completely neglected the weight or clumsiness of a space suit, perhaps the baseball player is inside a habitat big enough to play baseball in) as it is on the Earth. That is, you should be able to throw the baseball with about the same speed, particularly if you throw it horizontally. It will go further because it will not fall as quickly, that's all. Not because it is easier to throw.
*But &quot;newtons&quot;? We can introduce the unit of force, but we shouldn't depend on it. What we can do is to make clear that when we say &quot;weight,&quot; we are talking about the force of attraction, which depends on two things: the gravity and the mass (as well as the distance from the main source of gravity). But we need to keep in mind that &quot;weight&quot; is used commonly to mean &quot;mass&quot; as well, which is obvious, you know exactly what I mean when I say that a &quot;heavier&quot; ball is harder to throw. We mean that a 20 lb. ball, maybe a bowling ball? is harder to throw than an 8 oz. ball. Those are all units of weight, and we'd measure them with a scale. I measure mass with a scale, all the time. What is actually being measured, of course, is the force of gravity, so I'm assuming, in my weight measurements, a gravitational field of 1 g.
*I wanted to explain what &quot;g&quot; means better, and I wanted to use units of milli-gs, one-thousandth g, in the table. The reason is that it's much easier to read and grasp the whole numbers. We could use centi-g, and the table could express the gravitational field value in percentage of Earth gravitation. So the Earth would be 100% and the Moon would be 16.7%. And Phobos would be 0.5%. It's okay that a value of less than 1 is used for Phobos.... I think I'll do this.
*I think it's inspiring for kids to think of what it's like when there is no apparent gravity. It's an error, though, to say that there is any place with no gravity. Gravity is everywhere, but when there is nothing to resist it, we are in &quot;free fall.&quot; There is gravity acting on satellites in orbit and on the astronauts appearing to float in their space-suits, and on everything inside the International Space Station. But because it is all &quot;falling&quot; together, it seems like there is no gravity, that nothing has weight.
*I remember getting it, I was very young, that a satellite was &quot;falling.&quot; It's just that (thinking of a circular orbit) it falls &quot;around&quot; the Earth. The gravity pulls it down just enough to make it move in a circle around the earth. Obviously, it has to be going pretty fast! And, obviously, if it were moving this fast near the surface, where there is air, air resistance would quickly slow it down. (It would, in fact, get immediately very hot like a meteor, and it would then quickly fall to the ground). But on the moon, an object could be very low and still remain in orbit. (But there is, I believe, a very thin lunar atmosphere that would slow it down, don't know how long that would take.)
*I think most people imagine (without thinking about it) that there is no gravity in space. So we want to educate to dispel this idea. Kids can get that, I believe, easily.
*I think we also tend to imagine that it is dark in space, but maybe kids now, having seen so many bright photos of the space shuttle and ISS, don't have that mis-impression. It's very, very bright, at least in the vicinity of the Earth. Way, way, out, it gets dim as we get very far from the Sun. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:43, 13 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

== Thanks for improving the horn wikibook ==

I just wanted to thank you for working on the horn wikibook. I started it a bit ago, but don't have much time to devote to it. I check back on it now and then to add/edit and hope that others come and do likewise. I have a few questions and concerns about how you're doing the music though. What software are you using to generate the picture? Since you're releasing the picture into the public domain, could you also release the source file for future editing. I might suggest Lilypond be used for uniformity (and free/open-ness). Also there is some talk (neverending talk unfortunately) of adding music markup capability. Check out [http://www.wikisophia.org wikisophia] for an example of a wikimedia based wiki that uses lilypond for markup. I've thought that if I had more time and if music markup didn't come soon to the wikimedia sites, it would be nice to have a wiki solely devoted to the horn or music that allowed music markup. Anyways keep it up!

If you need templates from Wikipedia, please [[WB:RFI|ask for an import]] instead of doing a copy-paste move. Such moves violate the GDFL. As well, our site configuration is different from en.wikipedia, so identical template coding may not result in identical rendering or behaviour.

==Places to Find, Compare, and Check Price and Compatibility==

===PCPartPicker===
An online tool that includes several tools for first time or experienced PC builders. The main feature is being able to create part lists. In the part list tool, there are 2 more tools, the wattage estimation tool, and the compatibility checker.

== Troubleshooting ==

You just finished building your computer, you turn it on, and it doesn't work. This section helps you in case this happens.

=== The drives act strange ===

Make sure the IDE/ATA cable isn't longer than 18 inches (46 cm).

=== I pressed the power button and nothing happened ===

This could be due to a variety of reasons

* You forgot to connect the power button
* The power cable is loose
* The power is out
* The motherboard is grounded out
* You forgot (on certain motherboards) to connect the 12V 4-PIN cable to the motherboard.

=== My New Computer Randomly Restarts ===

* Bad UPS, check the voltage rails for your UPS
* Insufficient cooling of components, especially CPU

=== My New Computer Randomly Shuts Down / Crashes ===
* You have overclocked it above what the processor can do at it's current vcore voltage. Increase the vcore voltage.
* An internal/external cable is loose.

=== RMA ===

You found your problem component using the above sections, and you need to get a replacement for a part you bought online. This is known as an RMA(Return Merchandise Authorization). This is usually done through either the manufacturer or the store where you bought the item from.

== Modding + Decoration ==
{{Wikipediapar||case modding}}

So you don't just want to make a computer, you want to show it off. Or maybe you want to do something creative with your computer.

== Optimizing the System ==

If you are using a Windows system, you'll probably want to remove useless features and 'tweak' your system. Searching the internet for 'Windows Tweaks' will throw up a load of tweaks. Be warned. Don't do anything crazy and if you are scared-DON'T DO IT!

= Build a Laptop =
Few people know this but let me tell you a little secret- It IS possible to build a laptop/notebook computer. Be warned-It IS more difficult than building a desktop. Heres how:

== Getting Parts ==

Here are the parts you will need to make your pride and joy. But before you rush out to get it all, please scroll down to my DISCLAIMER. The parts are:

[http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=barebone+laptop+notebook&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle A Barebone Notebook]

A compatible Processer (search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

A compatible Hard Drive (search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

Some RAM (search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

WiFi Card (optional unless you have a Centrino notebook)(search with [http://froogle.google.com Froogle])

== Building It ==

[http://www.overclockers.com/tips1195/ THIS SITE] has a good guide on how to make the 'book. (I'm WAY too lazy to type it myself)

== Disclaimer ==

1. I HATE Going out shopping. If you do too, I have provided links to all the parts to buy online. However:
a) These may not ship to your area
b) I AM NOT advertising/selling/recommending all these parts!!!
2. If anything goes wrong I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
3. Operating System (OS) installation is the same as on a desktop
4. Please ensure you read and understand
a)These instructions/instructions on links
b)The Desktop building instructions in ths book
5. DO NOT attempt if you have never done a desktop before
6. Most important:
a)Slag your friends saying- &quot;I can build a laptop computer and you can't-HaHa&quot;
b)Enjoy your shiny new handbuilt laptop :)
7. If all goes wrong just [http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=cheap+laptops&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle BUY ONE] (see 1b)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book has been written as an aid to learning Welsh (''Cymraeg'' or ''y Gymraeg'', pronounced {{IPA|[kəmˈrɑːɨɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ə ɡəmˈrɑːɨɡ]}}). It is a Celtic language originating in Wales (''Cymru''), but is now only spoken by around a quarter of the Welsh population, as English has started to become the norm. It is also spoken in the Welsh settlement in the Chubut Valley of Patagonia, Argentina. There are also speakers of Welsh throughout the world, most notably in the rest of Great Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia.
Although coming from Wales, the large majority of the population can speak English. Welsh is spoken more in North Wales, but it is a legal requirement to satisfy both Welsh and English speakers and provide services in both languages throughout Wales. Most people in South Wales cannot speak Welsh, although it is encouraged in schools. The vast majority of children in Wales know some Welsh, and many are educated via the language, even if this is not their mother tongue. If visiting Wales, English will suffice; likewise Spanish is the primary language of Patagonia. One of the oldest European languages surviving, it is well worth learning if you require a job in Wales working in public services, or living here.

Due to the increasing use of the English language the numbers of Welsh speakers had been declining for decades.  However, following a number of measures, including the introduction of the Welsh Language Act in 1993, Welsh has enjoyed a strong revival in recent years and now officially has an equal status with English in the public sector in Wales. It is now the most widely spoken Celtic language.

An Indo-European language, Welsh belongs to the Brythonic branch of Celtic Languages, which includes Breton and Cornish. This branch is also named &quot;P-Celtic&quot;, because the &quot;qu&quot; consonant of Indo-European origin became a &quot;p&quot;. In the other branch, including Irish and Scots Gaelic, this consonant kept the same sound, giving rise to the name &quot;Q-Celtic&quot;. This is shown on the table to the right:

==Introduction to Welsh==

The following should be completed before beginning the Welsh course. You will learn how to pronounce Welsh, learn some basic greetings, count to 10, and learn a little bit about the grammar that you will face when learning Welsh.

* [[Welsh/Alphabet|The Welsh Alphabet]]  {{stage|75%|Jan 22, 2007}}
* [[Welsh/Pronunciation|Pronouncing Welsh Sounds]]
* [[Welsh/Useful Phrases|Some Useful Phrases]]  {{stage|75%|Jan 22, 2007}}
* [[Welsh/Numbers|The Welsh Numbering System]]  {{stage|50%|Feb 10, 2007}}

==Lessons==
Lessons will eventually cover all levels of Welsh. Mynediad, 'entry' in Welsh, is the first and is suitable for complete beginners to the language.

My name is Lilious. I'm a plant biologist working on root development using molecular biology techniques as well as fluorescence microscopy and i'm thinking to write about some of this subjects in wikibooks. I opened recently the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Plant_Sciences | Wikiversity of Plant Sciences]] to replace the former wikiversity of Botany which was empty. 
I plan to : developp the existing wikibook of [[Botany]] and set up the [[Wikiversity:School_of_Plant_Sciences | Wikiversity of Plant Sciences]] to provide :
* free of right teaching material made by wikiversity teachers
* links to some teaching ressources available on the web for students who want to learn more
* links to online ressources for plant scientists, such as databases, journals, tools for molecular biology, imaging, freewares... This ressource should be good enough to become a reference portal that can attract academic plant scientists to the wiki-world and incitate them to participate.
* web-based bibliography review with references, made and continuously updated by the wikiversity community. This will done on topics of particular interest in order to provide material to write specific sections of the wikibook of [[Botany]]
* Upload my personal reviews on fluorescence et genetic techniques, root gravitropism, hormones, lateral root development both as an online version as well as a pdf version.


I created this personal page by cut/paste from [[User:Cormaggio]] and [[:w:User:Seth_Ilys]] pages which are well formated. So some links might not be relevant to me and will disappear soon

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Note: Throughout the chapter, we will provide several sample hands with which to illustrate the various rules and strategies of five card draw. Each example is independent of any prior hand. Thus, rules regarding the rotation of dealership, order of play, and other such logistical facts will not apply, unless explicitly stated.''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Welcome to the table, everyone,&quot; Alex says as he sits himself down. &quot;So, what kind of game are we playing tonight? Five-ten? Ten-twenty?&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Ten-twenty sounds alright to me,&quot; Dana answers, and everyone nods in agreement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Well, I guess I'll just start as the button, if no one objects,&quot; Alex continues as he shuffles up the deck of cards ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What the heck is going on here? You might be thinking, &quot;I thought the kind of game was five card draw!&quot; So what's with the talk about ten and twenty? And what's a button, anyway?

==Overview==
Five card draw is a fun and thoughtful game of strategy, skill, and - as with all card games - a bit of luck. It derived from several card games invented in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, but truly flourished as game in the United States in the 1800s. It was a particularly popular game on the American Frontier, as it could be played with merely a deck of cards and anyone who was willing to risk their money at the table.

==Rules of Play==
* Deck: Standard 52 Card Deck
* Maximum number of players: 6
* Wild Cards: None
 
Five card draw is a very simple game to learn and to play with friends. It requires 2 players, but 3 or more are recommended, with 6 players being the maximum. For the purposes of this chapter, we have drafted five fictional poker players, Alex, Ben, Chris, Dana, and Ellen, who will demonstrate much of the rules and strategies of five card draw. Let's return to our earlier anecdote.

When Alex asked what kind of game they were going to play, he was actually asking what the size of the bets were going to be (also known as '''the [[../Betting|betting]] structure'''.) You can't just bet a random amount in a poker game - you have to bet according to predetermined betting increments. As you probably noticed, these betting amounts are called out in sets of two: &quot;five-ten&quot; and &quot;ten-twenty.&quot; This is because in poker games with multiple rounds of betting - including five card draw - the betting stakes are raised in subsequent rounds.

Since everyone agreed on &quot;ten-twenty&quot;, this means that for the first round of betting, if a player chooses to raise his opponent, he must increase his pot bet by $10, and by $20 in the second round. We'll get to the actual stages of betting later, but for now simply know what a &quot;ten-twenty game&quot; implies about the stakes at the table.

Continuing on with our anecdote, we will note now the general &quot;set up&quot; that goes into each hand. At the very beginning of play, one player is chosen to be the '''dealer''' - in this case, Alex. The dealer is also known as the '''button'''. This is more or less derived from the fact that, in order to keep track of who dealt last and who was to deal next in the older days, a brass button was handed from dealer to dealer. Over time, this tradition has evolved, and many decorative items are used in place of a plain old button to denote who is next to deal. At most casinos, there is only one house dealer at a poker table, and thus the &quot;button&quot; is merely symbolic in nature, though as we see in the next section it still has an important function in the game.

Before any actual cards are dealt, two initial '''antes''' must be placed into the pot in order to encourage play: the '''small blind''' and the '''big blind'''. The small blind is equal to ''one-half'' of the smaller of the two bets in a game. Thus, in a $10/$20 game, the small blind would be $5. This is placed into the pot by the player to the immediate left of the dealer. The big blind, as you can probably guess, is equal to 100% of the smaller bet. Thus, in a $10/$20 game, the big blind would be $10. This is placed into the pot by the player to the immediate left of the small blind. In the case of an unchanging house dealer, these bets are placed by the players to the left of the button. In tournament play, the blinds are consistently raised at set time intervals (usually after a certain number of hands have been played) as a means of speeding up the elimination of players. (We will discuss strategies involving the blinds later in this chapter.)

Once the blinds have been placed on the table, Alex will deal five cards, one at a time, face down to each player (to do otherwise would rename the game!), including himself. He then places the remainder of the deck - called the ''draw pile'' - face down near him. Each player now takes up his '''hand''' for examination. Hand ranking is discussed in the [[Poker:Basics|Basics]] chapter, for now we will continue with our discussion of the procedures for playing a hand.

Betting begins with the player to the left of the big blind - in our case, Ben was the small blind and Chris was the big blind, so play begins with Dana. Dana has three betting options at her disposal:

*Dana may simply '''fold''' her hand. That is, she places her cards in a discard pile (still face down) and is no longer eligible to win the hand.
*Dana may '''call'''. To call a bet at any time, a player must match the highest bet placed thus far on the table. Since Chris's $10 big blind is the highest bet, it will cost Dana $10 in order to call.
*Dana may '''raise'''. To raise a bet, a player must exceed the highest bet placed by one betting increment. Since Chris's $10 big blind is the highest bet, Dana must pay $20 to raise.

Let's assume Dana folds her hand (another name for folding is '''mucking'''.) Play then continues to Ellen. Ellen has the same three options as Dana. Let's assume she chooses to call, and Alex chooses to call as well.

Ben, as the small blind, has the same three choices as the other players have had. However, since he has already invested $5 into the pot, and he only has to ''match'' the highest bet placed, Ben would only have to place $5 more into the pot in order to call, and only $15 in order to raise. Ben decides his hand is no good and folds.

For Chris, the big blind, the situation is somewhat different. If someone had chosen to raise the pot, he would have had the same options as the other players: he could fold, call the bet, or raise his bet on top of the previous raise (also known as '''re-raising'''.) However, since no one has raised the pot, Chris can choose to '''check''' - he has already matched the highest bet on the table, and so he can remain in the pot without having to put in any additional money. Chris chooses to check, and now the round of discarding begins.

Each player has the option of discarding up to 3 cards from his or her hand. In games with 5 or less players, the rules can allow for the discarding of up to 4 cards - this is up to the players at the table. A player can of course choose to discard 0 cards if they feel their hand is strong enough. Once a player has discarded his or her cards, the dealer deals them a number of cards from the draw pile equal to what they have discarded.

A second round of betting now ensues. As was stated earlier, the minimum bet is now $20. The first player to act is the closest player to the dealer's left who is still in the hand. In our case, Ben the small blind has folded, and so Chris is the first to act. Since no new money has entered the pot, Chris elects to check. Ellen is the next to act, and she bets $20. Alex calls her $20, and Chris folds his hand. Alex and Ellen then turn over their hands, and the best hand wins the pot (a whopping $75, if you weren't keeping track!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This phrase &quot;To ever be used by a class in a real school the book must adhere to set standards&quot; is perjorative.  Who determined that independent schools, community schools, and home schools aren't 'real'?  There are better, more neutral, ways to say this idea.
(Heath) [[User:66.207.89.82|66.207.89.82]] 15:01, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
Not only does the phrase exclude a number of types of schools it also does the same to types of learners.  What about those of us that have long since graduated from &quot;school&quot; but still see ourselves as learners.  Does mean we should simply vanish.

== International standards ==

When I work on [[Algebra 2|this]], I have to try to decide how to interpret different standards to fit in the mix. I don't see why we need to have to coordinate books with standards that may or may not be actually good. I can testify, for instance, how standards lead to very poor academics in school. They do not interest most students, and those that do get interested is because the teacher/s lead them into further exploration. So I say, why not arrange books by interest levels, not by standards? Seems most sensible. Thanks, [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] ([[User talk:Laleena|talk]]) 22:18, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
:I'm sorry, Laleena, but I can't really agree, much as I wish I could. What the standards provide is a minimum, a level of factuality and verifiability, so that an educator using our texts (or any text) will have a basic level of trust in the materials he or she is using to teach. We &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; write to that minimum standard to be accepted. Without that minimum, we cannot be used for teaching and the whole thing becomes a pointless exercise. However: Nothing says that we can't exceed that minimum, and it is there that we hopefully can do better than the main stream. All the same, a text, even as flexible and fluid a text as WB, cannot inspire the way a teacher can. WB can, under the hands of a suitable teacher, inspire a class to new heights as it researches outside the classroom to find material to add to the text, to make a palpable contribution to the next class and to the future. There is no text that can make a mediocre teacher any good. What we have to do is meet the standards, exceed them where possible, and we have no choice but to trust the teachers to make the magic from what we can provide.

== Mmm? ==

I'm not sure to understand what you are saying, but if you feel it could benefit, go ahead. -- [[User:Icez]]

what I am saying is that why would I say:

Outline format:

Alternate formats:
   writing on your hand:
   
   psychic note taking:

instead of:

Outline format:

Two colum format:

Writing on your hand: no that is note a good idea that's still cheating

Pyschic note taking:


(and no, I wouldn't actually do those... unless I found a way that worked really well)

I think that what &quot;alternate formats&quot; are is very subjective.  Any format could be considered a &quot;main format&quot;, any format could also be considered an &quot;alternate format&quot;

== Yeah ==

Most of the formats are more useful for some kinds of subjects (like history, math, etc..).

== Re-organization of book ==

Hi!
I found this book by accident.
There is a recommended format for Wikibooks.
I thought it might be good idea to re-organize the material into this form.

A &quot;god&quot; by definition is &quot;that which ultimately calls the shots&quot;.  The human propensity to ultimately rely on something as a basis for judgment is universal and inescapable.  As it is true in every individual life, so it is true in societies as a whole.  Some source gives the basis for meaning and the interpretation of reality.  

Some countries are very explicit in decreeing their basis, which is religious by nature.  Israel is a good example in that it claims Judaism as its &quot;official&quot; religion.  Laws, holidays, family structures, education, etc.  stem from that faith.  So it is with England.  England claims to be &quot;Christian&quot; by religion and Anglican by denomination.  In Spain, you cannot hold political office unless you are a professed Catholic.  These countries and many others declare by edict or law what the religious perspective is, though that in and of itself does not necessarily demand individual  subserviance.  

The bottom line is that every society has a god as its foundation.  It is inescapable.  There is an inevitable &quot;theology&quot; that serves as an ethical infrastructure.  America originally was an assumed and decreed Christian nation, though the individual states had substantial autonomy.  The state of Delaware originally demanded that all elected and appointed officials of the state believed in Jesus Christ and held to the Old and New Testaments.  That is perhaps one of the most pointedly self concious civil requirements available in modern history.  

However, recognizing that all societies have rudimentary religious foundations does not imply that these foundations are theistic.  The former Soviet Union had an atheistic basis.  This too is a theological perspective.  In philosophical and theological terms, every belief is either theonomic or autonomous (God-centered or man-centered).  There is no escape and there are no other options.  

For instance, in America we talk freely and routinely about liberty.  Liberty is synonomous with freedom.  The Declaration of Independence held that rights were originally given by God and therefore, it was wrong for man to take them away.   Notice the theological basis for this position.  God was the giver, man was the recipient.  All through American history there were laws made, wars fought and ethics derived from that basic and foundational theological position.

In France, after the American Revolution, there was a similar revolution.  This revolution too was based on a theological perspective.  This perspective, developed and purported by Robiespierre, made man his own God and concommitantly pushed Christianity out of the picture.  It was a horrible experiment, yet it was clearly theologically oriented. 
Consequently, it is not a matter of theocracy vs no theocracy;  it is a matter of which theocracy.  The term &quot;theocracy&quot;, like so many other terms in philosophy and theology, is not a happy one. Nevertheless, the term is used repeatedly.</text>

You can simply use the screensavers Windows XP comes bundled with, if you wish. To use one of these screensavers, follow these steps:

# Go to the desktop.
# Right click and select &quot;Properties&quot; from the menu.
# A window should appear.
# Click on the &quot;Screen Saver&quot; tab at the top.
# Click on the drop-down menu.
# Pick a screensaver!

'''NOTE:''' If you want to edit something about the screensaver, click the settings button.

'''Fennel''' is both a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] and a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

As a spice, the dried seeds are ground for use. Fennel smells somewhat like [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Anise|Anise]] and [[Cookbook:Liquorice|liquorice]].

Fennel can be used in [[Cookbook:Pizza Sauce|pizza sauce]].

The small seeds, similar in size and appearance to [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds, are used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cooking]] (eg as an ingredient in [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]) or a constituent of [[Cookbook:Pan Masala|pan masala]], where their digestive properties are exploited.

The leaves are finely divided and feathery, like [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]. The herb is frequently used with [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]].

[[Cookbook:Florence Fennel|Florence fennel]], a cultivar of the plant, is grown for its bulb, which is used as a vegetable. As a vegetable, the stalks are used. A typical use would be [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]].

'''Pan masala''' is a mixture of spices such as cardamom, lime, menthol, clear catechu, betel nuts and other flavours. It is often eaten at the end of a meal to aid digestion and sweeten the breath. The mixture has a mild stimulating effect.

'''Florence fennel''' is variety of fennel that has been bred to grow a bulbous stem, which can be used as a vegetable. It has a crunchy texture and a flavour between [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and [[Cookbook:Aniseed|aniseed]].

The bulb can be eaten raw, in a salad, [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] as a side vegetable, or included as an ingredient in dishes such as [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]].</text>

{{spice}}

'''Liquorice''' or '''Licorice''' is a [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]] and [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]]. It smells somewhat like [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]], [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]].

Liquorice flavour is most commonly available as a liquid extract. The extract is produced by boiling liquorice root, then evaporating most of the water to leave a sweet syrup. The extract is widely used to make confectionery, especially black liquorice candies and liquorice allsorts. It can also be prepared as a tea.

Liquorice is also used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking, in broths and in foods simmered with soy sauce.

Liquorice increases blood pressure, is an expectorant (cough remedy), and acts as a mild laxative.

Hello! As anyone of us may have experienced, tech support can be a terrifying experience. However, it doesn't have to be a nightmare. In this book, I will be explaining to you how you can get optimum benefits from calling tech support. Enjoy!

Golden Rule:
* '''Tech support is trying to help you.''' Don't immediately ask for the supervisor, at least let them try but if all else fails call the supervisor.

==Before you call==
''&quot;On two occasions, I have been asked [by members of Parliament], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&quot; - Charles Babbage''

* Allow extra time for being on hold - have some cleaning, organizing, or other non-brain intensive work to be done?  Grab a headset and go to work while you wait.
* Don't worry if you are '''running software for the first time'''. Chances are, it's a small configuration problem.
* '''Know what kind of tech support they offer'''. Some call centers/tech support do not provide all levels of service. There are some that only take the calls and the escalate them to another group. There are others that try to solve everything with the first call. Don't get mad if the support person tells you they have to transfer you to another department.
* '''Only call for yourself''' and never for a friend. Chances are the friend is better off calling for themselves as they probably know more about the situation.
* Only call when '''you are at your computer''' and ready to do what the tech support assistant says. It will make it easier for the both of you.
* '''Use common sense.''' Too many callers do not. Here's a quick checklist to run down:
**Is the device on?
**Is everything plugged in?
**Are any cables loose?
**Have you tried rebooting the machine?

*A '''Lack''' of planning on your part, does '''NOT''' constitute an emergency on theirs.

==Calling==
* First off, '''speak clearly''', and do not shout into the phone. If you want the assistant on the other end to be able to help you, you really should be speaking in a neutral (not yelling but not very soft) and calm mode.
* Each time you call, '''tell them your name'''. Just because you may have called a few hours ago, doesn't mean they remember your name.
* '''Present a question, not a statement.'''
* Whenever you call, '''get to the point''' and don't give details that don't have anything to do with your situation. Also, don't brag, and don't talk about anything else.
* '''Don't be arrogant.''' Remember, if you have to resort to calling tech support, why claim to be the smart guy?
* '''They know how important your e-mail is.''' You don't have to describe it.
* '''The tech support assistant may not always be right, but the error messages are pretty much always right.''' Tell them the error message exactly.
*'''Jump through the hoops. Be patient''' Tech support has questions and steps that are laid out ahead of time to save time to cover all bases.  If you think you know what the problem is, you might be right and they'll get there eventually.  If you're wrong, they'll fix your issue right away.  Plus, if your issue needs to escalated to another department, all the basic questions will be answered which will speed up your resolution.
* '''Don't say things like &quot;I'm so stupid.&quot;''' They could probably infer that. 
* '''DON'T LIE!''' They probably will find out.  They have all heard, &quot;Nothing has changed&quot; so often when it has not been true that when you offer this they immediately know it to not be true.  If they ask and you say &quot;nothing has changed&quot; they might believe you.
* When you see an error, '''write it down'''. If you write it then, you can tell them the exact error, and they could help you based on the error.  On Windows computers, it is possible to click (highlight) the error window and hit &lt;i&gt;Alt+PrintScreen&lt;/i&gt;.  This will copy the error message to the clipboard, from which you can paste into a document and print it for reference.  Hit &lt;i&gt;PrintScreen&lt;/i&gt; for the whole screen.  When tech support is across the network, you can paste the error graphic directly into an email message.
* '''Think about the priority''' of the call. If the error is affecting everyone at your business and is causing a big loss, that would be considered a top priority issue.
* '''Get a ticket number'''. Most call centers track calls with numbered 'tickets'. It always helps to write down the ticket number.
* '''Don't tell tech support how to solve the problem'''. It doesn't help if you tell tech support how to fix your problem. If you are calling then chances are your solution doesn't work.
* '''Tell tech support if there was someone working on your computer'''. Let the support person know if there was another technical person working on the same problem. Quote a ticket number if you have one.
*'''Don't Assume''', especially when talking about internet based items such as email or a website. Don't assume the problem is with the company. Chances are it is a setting, old cookie, or firewall issue on your computer, or issue with your ISP. Remember, especially if it is a website: if the site is down, they're losing money, and losing money is bad. A company will do anything possible to get back up and running ASAP. How long you wait on hold is a good indication.
*'''If you've forgotten your password''', try looking for a 'Forgot your password' link. It may save you a wait on hold.
*If '''Hardware failed''', do not blame anyone.  '''All''' hardware will eventually fail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Truly Removing Log Off User ==

We all know that WIN+R will launch the Run dialog. And if you didn't know that before, you do now. It's an easy way to launch programs in your path or Web pages (provided they start with either &quot;http&quot; or &quot;www&quot;). You can make a shortcut to this command easily in Windows XP, but first you need to have the default Start Menu view enabled. Once that's done, simply drag &amp; drop the Run icon from the menu to your desktop (which is akin to a &quot;cradle to the grave&quot; operation). Rename it at will. While we're on the subject of XP Professional's Start Menu, if you wanna get rid of the Help and Logoff icons, TweakUI may not do the trick. But there are 2 methods to do the same used Windows Xp's built-in tools.&lt;br&gt;

===1) Using group policies:===
Launch gpedit.msc (from the Run command line). Be careful what you toggle in here; you could very well deny access to essential Windows features. Select ''User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Start Menu and Taskbar &gt; Remove [This] menu from Start Menu''. Of course, [This] could be &quot;Help,&quot; &quot;Logoff,&quot; or any other menu component. Note that the &quot;F1&quot; key will still respond to your call.

===2) Using registry===
[[Image:NoLogOff.png|right|thumb|200px|Screenshot of removing/disabling logoff]]

Type REGEDIT on your run dialog box. Now browse to the following location in the window that opens up.
'''HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer'''. On the right side you may see a [[value]] named '''NoLogOff'''. Double click on it and change its value to '''1'''
If you don't see the '''NoLogOff''' [[value]] then create a '''[[STRING]]''' [[value]] and name it as '''NoLogOff'''; now change its [[data]] to '''1'''&lt;br&gt;
You may need to reboot.

== Kill the Passport Balloon ==
Too many people are tricked into believing that you need to sign up for a Passport account when you get Windows XP. Wonderful job the marketing folks did, eh? Well, if you don't want to sign up for an account, nobody is forcing you to. At least, not yet. Are you tired of being reminded about signing up? Fire up REGEDIT.EXE and find your way to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ MessengerService. You'll see a &quot;PassportBalloon&quot; binary value in the right-hand pane. Double-click to open it. Now, in the resulting &quot;Edit Binary Value&quot; dialog, press the Delete key and enter: &quot;0a&quot; (that's a zero, sans quotes). This will effectively set the reminder counter to 10 and you won't be bothered with it again. Don't want the Windows Messenger to pop up when you launch Outlook Express? In the Registry, get to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Outlook Express and either edit or add a DWORD Value: &quot;Hide Messenger&quot; (sans quotes). Set this to &quot;2&quot; and you'll be good to go. Thanks to X-Setup (XTEQ.COM) for providing an easier way to get this done. Within that program, you can right-click on a plug-in and select &quot;Information&quot; for details and script code.

== Kill the Animated Search Character ==
When I first saw the default search pane in Windows XP, my instinct was to return it to its classic look; that puppy had to go. Of course, I later discovered that a doggie door is built into the applet. Click &quot;Change preferences&quot; then &quot;Without an animated screen character.&quot; If you'd rather give it a bare-bones &quot;Windows 2000&quot; look and feel, fire up your Registry editor and navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Explorer \ CabinetState. You may need to create a new string value labeled &quot;Use Search Asst&quot; and set it to &quot;no&quot; (sans quotes in each case). Before you go that far, let me make you aware of two things. First, you can accomplish the same task via the new TweakUI (available for download at WINDOWSXP.COM). Second, there's a nice benefit to the new Search Companion in Internet Explorer 6.0 (at least, with Microsoft Office's spell checker installed). Launch your browser and tap the F3 key. Now, enter your query, intentionally misspelling a keyword. Look at that! A red squiggly! Right-click on the word and select an appropriate replacement (if necessary). How's that for helpful?

== Strange errors ==

From time to time, you will encounter some persistent errors or issues.  The best way to resolve them is to try searching for that error on a search engine.   More often than not, you may encounter the result on the first link (especially if you search by the error message), or otherwise have enough information to find the correct path. 

While contacting the local computer expert may seem tempting, remember that they want to do work as well.  As always, search before asking.

==Three Phase Alternating Current==

In North America, three phase alternating current is generated and transmitted using three conductors to industry, commercial buildings and to a group of houses.  Some older installations use 2400/4160Y three-phase systems, but most currently use 7200/12470Y.
Near a group of houses is a step down transformer wired in a &quot;Wye&quot; or &quot;Star&quot; configuration. Each individual house receives one of these three phases.  The neutral conductor comes from the middle tap of the &quot;Wye.&quot;  Other houses receive different phases which are balanced throughout the group. One 7200 volt line feeds a transformer to a house, which then creates two hot legs and one neutral 120/240.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:3PhaseWaveform.gif]] --&gt;

In a house, the breaker panel provides connections between the two phases and the neutral conductor.  Most of the household outlets are connected between one of the &quot;hot&quot; [[Electric Motors And Generators/Single-phase|phases]] and the neutral with a safety breaker permitting a maximum of 15 amperes.  For the larger loads, such as the oven and the clothes dryer, the breaker panel connects across the two hot phases to provide 240 volts, limited to a maximum of 40 amperes.

AT&amp;T was making and selling Unix and the University of California Berkley was making and giving away their own patches for Unix.  A group of ex-Berkley students took the patches and formed a complete system and began selling it, trouble didn't start until they began advertising with a slogan of &quot;It's Unix!&quot;.

A lawsuit resulted, which dragged in the University of California due to it's releasing the code in the first place.  The case went on for a long time, slowing the development of the BSD projects that had begun as completely open source operating systems.

It was LSU versus UoCB and BSDi.

During the case it was found that a large portion of the code in Unix was actually BSD code stripped of it's license, thus breaking the terms of the license and placing LSU in an uncomfortable position.  A settlement was made in which the whole of the results were kept from the public for several years, but for the most part freed the BSD code and any who use it from any legal action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==use of tables and metric==

The standard for ingredient lists is what you see everywhere. If really want to change that, please bring it up on the [[Talk:Cookbook|Cookbook talk page]].

This would obviously be a tremendous effort.

The end result would be more complex to edit. I think lots of people are going to have trouble with tables. Sometimes the tables are worth the trouble ([[Cookbook:Fish]] and [[Cookbook:Smoke Point]]), but not for simple ingredient lists.
This is especially so if there is no additional benefit, such as database lookups on the ingredients.

The standard for units has been to put the converted version in parentheses. This lets you know which version is primary and which might be a crude approximation. Since we can now link to the unit names, there is very little point in having the converted units. This is especially true when the primary units are Queen Anne (USA), because the conversion to metric is very easy.

:Hi Albert,

:I'd really like to use a standardized way of presenting the ingredients. It would be helpful if you could point me to a page that is laid out the way you think is best.  I went over, for example, to [[Cookbook:Pasta recipes]] and went down the line; I didn't see anybody that followed the convention that I understand you to be talking about.

:Some recipes used Queen Anne, others metric. I like the idea of showing both: it makes it easier, at least for me, to follow.

:Just to make sure I'm being clear, I'm not pushing back on your revert (it was really just an experiment), but a model ingredient list for me to follow would be a good thing.

:[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 14:27, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::There simply aren't too many recipes that supply both units, but [[Cookbook:Coq au Vin]] is one example. Despite being a &quot;French&quot; recipe, the Queen Anne units came first. Metric, being added later, gets parentheses to indicate that it is a conversion. Ugh, it should be &quot;mL&quot;, not &quot;ml&quot;. (there is no metric unit named &quot;ml&quot;) Note the inaccuracy of the conversion. (20% more salt, 20% less pepper, 10% more chicken, 12% less wine)

::So, if you really want to supply both, that's the existing practice.

::A much more serious problem is amounts given by mass. Normal cooks in the USA can easily deal with Queen Anne volume, large metric volume (100 mL increments), °F temperatures, baking chocolate by the ounce, and meat by the pound (decimal or fraction, not pounds and ounces). Smart cooks can convert metric to Queen Anne to handle small volumes, and can estimate kg of meat by eye. Most cooks would give up. For non-meat items given by mass though, a conversion involving density is required! Households in the USA simply do not own kitchen scales. Probably a scale or balance could be had for $30 from an exotic cooking store. It is probably more common to own a zester, marble rolling pin, melon baller, springform pan, pressure cooker, 2-part angelfood cake pan... In fact my mom, an expert cook, does indeed have all those things and no scale or balance.

::I generally keep things simple and easy to edit, with plenty of links. (examples: [[Cookbook:Saffron Rice]], [[Cookbook:Jambalaya]]) There is a template recipe linked off the bottom of the main page that you can use if you want to get fancy, but it looks really dumb unless you know obscure stuff like the number of Calories in the dish. Be sure to delete the unused sections (often &quot;Warnings&quot;) if you use this template. I find it easier to start from a recipe that is similar to the one I'm adding, especially if the categories will be the same.

::Watch out for recipes using Imperial units, which are 20% larger than Queen Anne units. This is a common problem with UK recipes, and yet another reason for metric conversions to be seriously inaccurate. If you go through the cookbook converting recipes without great care, you might create some additional confusion.

::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:35, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)


:Once again I find that the world gets so much more complicated as you look more closely at it. :-)

:I'm not sure I'm convinced that the accuracy you assume (10% more of this, 12% less of that) is justified. Right now I'm looking at the nutritional label on a bag of sushi rice that I have. It says 160 Calories per serving; not 150 or 170? And the bag contains &quot;Approx. 25&quot; servings. What we're talking about here is the difference between a 'cook' and a person who follows recipes, and why the phrase &quot;correct the seasonings&quot; shows up so often in cookbooks. Of course, I'm not disputing your basic point.

:My motivation was in part the link I put in the Wikipedia's Sushi page to this article. It's the old question of whether recipes should appear in the the Encyclopedia; my opinion is &quot;Occasionally, but ususally not&quot;. This one is sufficiently complicated that I was using a 'one copy of a piece of information' theory. Perhaps I'll change my mind in a few days and copy it back. But in the mean time it's better for me to have one copy rather than try to keep up the changes in two places. Particularily because there's some weird war going on in History of sushi comparing ''sushi'' to ''pizza'' from ''Pizza Hut''. I'm waiting for the rice dust to settle.

:But the new link was also a motivation for the different units. I'm assuming that people from many parts of the world will look at it, and (I hope) make good adjustments.

[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 18:43, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Albert,

I adapted the recipe, trying to follow the ''Coq au Vin'' model. See what you think.

One other thing to note. It's important to be careful when reverting articles.  :-)  As a side effect to removing the table, there were also formatting bugs introduced back into the article (there were two sections in the ToC marked &quot;1&quot; because the '===' had been incorrect), and two or three other improvements were lost.  I fixed that by reverting the reversion, and then making the measurement changes from there.

[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 13:47, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

That looks good. I like the way you adjusted the larger metric conversions to match the &quot;2 mL&quot; one, keeping the error under 5%. Probably this trick should be documented somewhere.

As for the other changes reverted, they didn't seem significant. I generally find the ToC to be ugly and useless, so I didn't notice the double occurance of &quot;1&quot;. I only saw minor font changes and the addition or removal of the lines that go with 2nd level headers, none of which seemed all that significant. Disabling the ToC (with &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the top of the page) would have solved the problem.

[[User:Redlentil]] and I have been going around lowercasing ingredients as we edit pages. It's some sort of pet peeve for him I think (&quot;my bete noire&quot; he says), and a minor aesthetic issue for me. If you really think it looks better the other way, then that's another thing that ought to be discussed on the Cookbook talk page.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:19, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] instructions ==

Problem with the new instructions:

The rice is in a colander to drain. I add konbu to a pot (the one with vinegar dressing?), along with some saki. I boil water. (in a teapot I guess) For some reason, I remove the konbu from my pot as the seemingly-unrelated water boils. This leaves me with either a pot of saki or saki+vinegar+sugar+salt. Something simmers for 20 minutes... but I have two pots and a colander full of rice now, so I'll take a guess that you mean the water. (nothing else is cooking)

The 2nd and 3rd steps now must be read together. If they are not, the dressing might need to be transferred from a mixing bowl to the saucepan.

I think you should revert that and try again.

Leaving the [[Cookbook:Hangari|hangari]] link would be a good idea too. Probably both spellings are good, given the difficulty in making up romanized versions of Japanese words.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:30, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I added some extra pointers in so that people won't get mixed up, boil water in their teapot, and endup eating all that dry rice.
::Honestly, I'm still lost. Suppose I put my rice in the colandar to drain. Now, I wish to boil the konbu. Is it optional, required, or prohibited that I use the water from cooking the rice? Must I add the rice back into the pot before or after dealing with the konbu? (perhaps it does not matter?) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:29, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:As for hangiri: you know, I've asked around on the Wikipedia site, and what I'm hearing is that it is not just a transliteration error. Just as 'sake' seems to be misspelled in the Cookbook as 'saki' (see, for example, the disambiguation page in the Wikipedia). I need to say that I don't speak a word of Japanese, so I'm relying on people who either are Japanese or have lived in Japan for extended periods. Could be there are different ways to transliterate it.
::Example: Japanese has several sounds that map onto the English 'L' and 'R'. It's sort of a different axis though, so one Japanese speaker could say all of those Japanese sounds in a way that would be 'R' while another might make them sound like 'L'. This is why Japanese natives struggle with the L-R distinction. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:29, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== egg sizes ==

The sushi omelet recipe (at [[Cookbook:Sushi]], but perhaps should be separate) specifies &quot;4 extra-large Eggs&quot;.
Well, wouldn't you know, this differs from country to country.

The &quot;USDA Large&quot; egg is about the same as the &quot;EU size M&quot; egg. (both being the common choice AFAIK) So, for normal recipes, it is best to avoid specifying egg size. I hope you know what you need. USDA eggs are specified as the minimum weight of a dozen. EU eggs are specified as the weight ranges per 100, plus a per-egg minimum.

 EU weight standard
 
 SIZE             PER-EGG        PER-100-MIN
 XL-very large    73 g and more   7.3 kg
 L-large          63 to 73        6.4
 M-medium         53 to 63        5.4
 S-small          under 53 g      4.5
 
 USDA weight standard
 
 CLASS         MIN NET / DOZEN   CONVERTED TO MIN GRAM/EGG
 Jumbo         30 ounces         70.75
 Extra Large   27 ounces         63.675
 Large         24 ounces         56.6
 Medium        21 ounces         49.525
 Small         18 ounces         42.45
 Peewee        15 ounces         35.375

I hope you aren't using a Japanese standard, because I don't know what that would be. Same as USDA, because of World War II maybe?

Assuming you mean &quot;USDA Extra Large&quot;, this is 255 to 283 grams of egg. (probably 255, if the producers are being cheap) This is about 4.5 regular (USDA Large) eggs. It is probably about 5 EU size M eggs. (4.71 if both parts of the world are being cheap, and closer to 4 if the EU producers are generous)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The story of Israel is like no other. The country of Israel you see on the map today is named after the ancient kingdom of Israel in the [[Biblical Studies|Hebrew Bible]] (the Old Testament). People of the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] believe that the kingdom was granted to the Jews by God. But the modern state of Israel is not a direct continuation of this ancient kingdom. It has its origins in the political '''Zionist movement''' of the 19th century.

==The Old Yishuv under the Ottoman Empire==
[[File:MarktJaffaGustavBauernfeind1887.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Painting of Jaffa (south of modern [[w:Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv]]) in 1887]]
Since ancient times, Jews had been moved from Israel, by necessity or by force, to various places around Europe and other parts of the world. By 1516, only a small community of 5,000 remained in Galilee. At that point, the first pre-modern ''[[w:Pre-Zionist Aliyah|aliyah]]'' (return) began, with [[w:Sephardic|Sephardic]] (Spanish-speaking) victims of the Inquisition arriving in Israel with the approval of the [[w:Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these Jews formed a community called the [[w:Old Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] (settlement), centered in [[w:Safed|Safed]] in Galilee. They were joined in the 19th century by Jewish religious movements from other parts of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; notably among which, were the disciples of the Goan of Vilna, whom settled in Jerusalem beginning in 1808, by 1810 they numbered 511 families.

The Jews called their homeland ''[[w:Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]]'', meaning the Land of Israel, as opposed to the nation of Israel consisting of all Jews. The Ottoman Empire did not administer ''Eretz Israel'' under any particular designation. The region was officially under the control of the provinces of Syria and Palestine/Lebanon, but the Ottoman government was weak (it was the [[w:Decline of the Ottoman Empire|Decline of the Ottoman Empire]]) and day-to-day affairs were dictated by local leaders. Eventually, Jerusalem and Jaffa were given their own division.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who else lived in Palestine?==
There were many kinds of people in Palestine. The majority were Arabs, but there were also Greeks, Armenians and many others (Christian and Muslim), as well as the Old Yishuv.

{{quote|The population of Jerusalem is composed of Muslims, Jews, Greeks, Latins, Armenians, Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics and a handful of Protestants. One hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now in this birthplace of Christianity. The nice shades of nationality comprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, are altogether too numerous to mention. It seems to me that all the races and colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among the 14,000 souls that dwell in Jerusalem.|Mark Twain, ''The Innocents Abroad''. 1867.}}
Under Ottoman rule, only Muslims were allowed to hold land. The Ottomans also attempted to retard Jewish immigration with various local laws. In practice, though, a well-educated Jew could deal with Turkish officials to legally immigrate, and then establish a semi-legal hold on land by farming it. The true problems began for the nascent Zionist movement when they encountered the overwhelming Arab majority as well as the existing Old Yishuv community.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, pp. 51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Birth of Zionism==
Although the earliest Christians tolerated Jewish communities, [[w:antisemitism|antisemitism]] arose during several periods in the Middle Ages. Jews lived separately from Christians and adhered to ''kashrut'' (kosher) laws and other customs that seemed mysterious and alien. Most jobs were forbidden to Jews as an &quot;out-group&quot;, so they took up money-lending and intellectual studies, leading to a popular conception that they profited from the work of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Roth. ''Medieval Jewish Civilization''. p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 10th century, most of Europe was under the rule of Christian monarchs. As the Jews managed the debts of the monarchs, expelling the Jews was an efficient way to balance a failing kingdom's budget. In Germany [[w:Persecution of Jews in the First Crusade|the persecution of Jews was renewed]] in 1096 during the Crusades. Jews were [[w:Edict of Expulsion|expelled from England]] in 1291, from France in 1391, from Austria in 1421, and [[w:Alhambra Decree|from Spain]] in 1492. Anti-Jewish laws such as the [[w:yellow badge|yellow badge]] were commonplace in most European countries, and mob violence was common. Martin Luther, the leader of the Protestant Reformation, also wrote a book entitled ''[[w:On the Jews and Their Lies|On the Jews and Their Lies]]'', which fueled more antisemitism. The strongest retaliations occurred in the seventh century as mass expulsions and forced conversions occurred in many European countries. 

Among Jewish communities the solution to this violence was not entirely clear. It was believed that in a future messianic age, their ancient kingdom would be restored;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A.R., 1971, 'Vision and intent in Zionist Thought', p. 10,11&lt;/ref&gt; hence prayers on [[w:Yom Kippur|Yom Kippur]] and [[w:Passover|Passover]] would conclude (and still do) with &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot;.

During the Age of Enlightenment, many European countries granted Jews equal rights. An intellectual class developed among both Jews and Gentiles which considered the abandonment of old traditions and the assimilation into the European lifestyle the key to the success of the Jewish people. One Russian socialist wrote the following about his view of ethnicity:
{{quote|You well know that I hate Judaism exactly as I hate all other nation &quot;hoods&quot; and national &quot;isms&quot; [...] but I am not ashamed of my Jewish descent, and, among the other oppressed, I love that part of humanity whom the ruling national and religious principles single out as Jews. And again, indeed, I do not love them all, but only the suffering masses and those capable of joining us. Otherwise I should not deserve the name of socialist.|Aaron Samuel Lieberman, quoted in Halpern 2000, p. 143}}
However, antisemitism did not fade but merely [[w:Racial antisemitism|changed its target]], segregating the Jews as an &quot;un-European&quot; ethnic group. Ashkenazi Jews experienced hundreds of bloody mob attacks throughout Eastern Europe during the [[w:Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]]. When European intellectuals saw that merely changing their lifestyles was insufficient, allegiance to the Jewish people began to seem like an acceptable option. (American Jews did not experience systematic and government-enforced antisemitism, and thus tended to downplay ethnic alliances.)&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; An exemplary Russian Jew who changed his mind about settlement in Israel was [[w:Moshe Leib Lilienblum|Moshe Leib Lilienblum]], who first aimed towards economic independence in America, then decided that only in Israel could Jews live without alienation from society.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikipedia|Timeline of Zionism}}In a proto-Zionist essay hinting towards a desire to resettle in Palestine, Moses Hess bemoaned the secularism of intellectuals, and reminded them of the sacred place of pious Jews:
{{quote|It seems that on account of the hatred which surrounds him on all sides, the German Jew is determined to estrange himself from Judaism as far as possible, and endeavors even to deny his race. No reform of the Jewish religion, however extreme, is radical enough for the educated German Jew. [...]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My grandfather once showed me some olives and dates, and remarked, with beaming eyes, &quot;These were raised in Eretz Israel.&quot; Everything that reminds the pious Jew of Palestine is as dear to him as the sacred relics of his ancestral house.|Moses Hess, &quot;[[w:Rome and Jerusalem|Rome and Jerusalem]]&quot;. 1862.}}
The political motivation for Zionism began to form in the 1860s and 1870s. The first &quot;Zion Society&quot; formed in Germany in 1861. In 1870, the ''Alliance Israélite Universelle'' founded an agricultural school called [[w:Mikveh Israel|Mikveh Israel]] near the city of Jaffa. The land for this school was granted by the Ottoman Sultan.
===The first Zionists immigrate===
{{wikisource|Auto-Emancipation}}
{{quote|If we already knew where to direct our steps, were we compelled to emigrate again, we could surely make a vast step forward. We must set vigorously to work to complete the great task of ''self-liberation''. We must use all the resources which human intellect and human experience have devised, instead of leaving our national regeneration to blind chance. The territory to be acquired must be fertile, well-situated and sufficiently extensive to allow the settlement of several millions. The land, as national property, must be inalienable. |Leon Pinsker, &quot;[[wikisource:Auto-Emancipation|Auto-Emancipation]]&quot;. 1882.}}
In the same year that Pinsker's essay was published, the [[w:First Aliyah|first Zionist Aliyah]] occurred. Roughly 30,000 Jews left Eastern Europe to become farmers in the Ottoman Empire. While previous ''aliyah'' had been religious in nature, this one was purely political-- an escape from antisemitism, with the goal of creating a sustainable Jewish community in ''Eretz Israel''. However, half of the settlers eventually left the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/First_Aliyah.html Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them came on a 30-day pilgrimage visa, and stayed past its expiration date. The pasha (governor) of Jerusalem attempted to expel them from the Empire, but was rebuked by foreign ambassadors; in 1889, he was replaced by a more liberal pasha.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We have made it a rule not to say too much, except to those ... we trust ... the goal is to revive our nation on its land ... if only we succeed in increasing our numbers here until we are the ''majority'' .... There are now only five hundred [thousand] Arabs, who are not very strong, and from whom we shall easily take away the country if only we do it through stratagems [and] without drawing upon us their hostility before we become the strong and populous ones.|Letter from Ben-Yehuda and Yehiel Michael Pines to Rashi Pin, October 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-2001.'' Vintage Books, 2001, p49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theodor Herzl and the World Zionist Congress==
Zionism had already developed by the time of the First Aliyah, but those who promoted it were working at cross purposes. The Orthodox Jews behind Religious Zionism were willing to cooperate with secularized Jews to the extent of sending people to Israel, but wanted simultaneously to teach them about their duties to God, and agitated for those living in ''Eretz Israel'' to live under the rule of the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Religious Zionists and the Old Yishuv were unhappy at the prospect of secular Jews tilling the land during a sabbath year; an attempt to appease them by subletting the land to non-Jews while the work was being done fell through.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 106-9&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a growing coalition of [[w:Labor Zionism|Labor Zionists]] who wanted ''Eretz Israel'' to be a breeding ground for intentionally organized collectives, a land which would be controlled by its own working class.

Theodor Herzl entered into the Zionist movement fully aware of these competing interests, and considered their balance &quot;an egg dance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern 2000, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Herzl was a journalist from Vienna assigned to the [[w:Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfus Affair]]. Alfred Dreyfus was a Jewish officer in French Army accused of passing military documents to the German Embassy. Despite the lack of any conclusive evidence, he was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment. From the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl concluded that antisemitism was difficult to escape no matter how &quot;enlightened&quot; a country one lived in.

He interviewed with Baron Maurice De Hirsch, one of the wealthiest men of his time. De Hirsch had founded the Jewish Colonization Association with the aim of settling Jews from Russia and Romania to Argentina and other parts of the Americas. Herzl came with 22 pages of notes arguing for a political organization to rally Jews under their own flag  rather than leave it to philanthropists like the Baron. De Hirsch was uninterested in this suggestion. This led to Herzl publishing a pamphlet called ''The Jewish State''.

{{wikisource|The Jewish State}}

{{quote|Let all who are willing to join us, fall in behind our banner and fight for our cause with voice and pen and deed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those Jews who agree with our idea of a State will attach themselves to the Society, which will thereby be authorized to confer and treat with Governments in the name of our people. The Society will thus be acknowledged in its relations with Governments as a State-creating power. This acknowledgment will practically create the State.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Should the Powers declare themselves willing to admit our sovereignty over a neutral piece of land, then the Society will enter into negotiations for the possession of this land. Here two territories come under consideration, Palestine and Argentine. In both countries important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end badly. It continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the Government to stop a further influx of Jews. Immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Society of Jews will treat with the present masters of the land, putting itself under the protectorate of the European Powers, if they prove friendly to the plan. We could offer the present possessors of the land enormous advantages, assume part of the public debt, build new roads for traffic, which our presence in the country would render necessary, and do many other things. The creation of our State would be beneficial to adjacent countries, because the cultivation of a strip of land increases the value of its surrounding districts in innumerable ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[...] If His Majesty the Sultan were to give us Palestine, we could in return undertake to regulate the whole finances of Turkey. We should there form a portion of a rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism. We should as a neutral State remain in contact with all Europe, which would have to guarantee our existence.|Theodor Herzl, &quot;[[wikisource:The Jewish State/The Jewish Question|The Jewish State]]&quot;. 1896.}}

===Formation of the Congress===
Zionists responded eagerly to Herzl's suggestion to meet and unify their diverse organizations. The First Zionist Congress was convened in Switzerland in August 1897. There were 200 delegates representing every aspect of Jewish religion, cultural philosophy, and thought. The 3-day congress founded the World Zionist Organization with Herzl as president.

During the First Zionist Congress, the following agreement, commonly known as the Basel Program, was reached:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law. The Congress contemplates the following means to the attainment of this end:
#The promotion by appropriate means of the settlement in ''Eretz Israel'' of Jewish farmers, artisans, and manufacturers.
#The organization and uniting of the whole of Jewry by means of appropriate institutions, both local and international, in accordance with the laws of each country.
#The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national sentiment and national consciousness.
#Preparatory steps toward obtaining the consent of governments, where necessary, in order to reach the goals of Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/basleprogram.htm The Basle Program. Resolutions of the First Zionist Congress] August 30, 1897 (mideastweb)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mauschel (Seff), Die Welt, 15. Oct 1897.png|thumb|right|200px|''[[w:Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'', the newspaper of the World Zionist Congress. It was printed in German.]]

Herzl met with the Ottoman Sultan and asked for a charter that would allow Jewish mass immigration to Palestine. This request was denied. Knowing the overwhelming support for a Jewish state in ''Eretz Israel'', he then met with Great Britain and discussed making Jewish settlement in Sinai Peninsula, part of their client state of Egypt. This too failed, but the British suggested making room in &quot;Uganda&quot; (actually Kenya) instead. Herzl brought this idea to the Zionist Congress in 1903. The debate over the Uganda option was so heated that the Congress nearly schismed into two rival factions.

===Responses to Zionism===
By 1904, cultural Zionism was accepted by most Zionists and a schism was beginning to develop between the Zionist movement and Orthodox Judaism. In 1912, [[w:World Agudath Israel|World Agudath Israel]] was founded by Orthodox Jews in response to the popularity of Zionism, socialism, and communism. It aimed to promote the traditional forms of the Jewish religion, although there was and is much diversity within Orthodox Judaism.

==Second Aliyah==
Between 1904, when pogroms in Eastern Europe intensified, and 1914, when World War I began, there was a [[w:Second Aliyah|Second Aliyah]]. Once again, half of the pioneers left ''Eretz Israel'' eventually, but the Second Aliyah had more successes than the first. The settlement of [[w:Tel Aviv|Tel Aviv]] was founded by political Zionists on a sand dune north of Jaffa, and its founding families built roads and a water system for themselves. Today, Tel Aviv is the second largest city in Israel. The Second Aliyah Zionists also founded a self-defense group called the [[w:Hashomer|Hashomer]], built a high school, and they cast off the [[w:Yiddish|Yiddish]] of their European ancestors to begin a [[w:revival of the Hebrew language|revival of the Hebrew language]]. Use of Hebrew had been attempted during the First Aliyah, but the language only took root during the Second.  Pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary were standardized, textbooks were written, and by 1913 when a German Zionist group attempted to start a technical university taught in German, the entire Yishuv rebelled against them.

The Labor Zionists who arrived during the Second Aliyah discovered that the settlers of the First Aliyah had become landlords, paying Arabs to tend their land for them.
{{quote|We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was not the way we hoped to settle the country—this old way with Jews on top and Arabs working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed at all. There must be a better way.|Yossef Baratz, founder of the first kibbutz&lt;ref&gt;Baratz, Joseph. ''A Village by the Jordan: The Story of Degania''. Tel Aviv: Ichud Habonim, 1956, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;}}Baratz and his fellow ''olim'' (Jews arriving in Israel) knew that they could not maintain independent farms. The poor land conditions and weak government meant that settlers had to rely on each other. Instead, Baratz and eleven of his companions established a communal farm called [[w:Degania Alef|Degania]] at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. Their community would grow into the first [[w:kibbutz|kibbutz]].

The founders of Degania worked backbreaking labor attempting to rebuild what they saw as their ancestral land and to spread the social revolution. One pioneer later said &quot;the body is crushed, the legs fail, the head hurts, the sun burns and weakens.&quot; At times half of the kibbutz members could not report for work. Many young men and women left the kibbutz for easier lives in Jewish cities on the East Bank of the Jordan or returned to the Diaspora. But despite the difficulties, by 1914, Degania had fifty members. Other kibbutzim were founded around the Sea of Galilee and the nearby Jezreel Valley.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==World War I==
In December 1914, as the machinations of World War I made it apparent that Britain would enter into battle with the Ottoman Empire, [[w:Ze'ev Jabotinsky|Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] proposed that a Jewish regiment be formed in Palestine to assist the British. This battalion, called the [[w:Jewish Legion|Jewish Legion]], was formed in 1917. A Jewish espionage network called [[w:Nili|Nili]] also assisted the British.

[[File:Capture of Jerusalem 1917.jpg|thumb|right|British cannons capture Jerusalem from the Ottomans.]]
In November 1917, as General Allenby was preparing to conquer Palestine, the British Foreign office issued the [[w:Balfour Declaration|Balfour Declaration]], a letter from the Foreign Secretary, Lord Balfour, to Lord Rothschild, head of the British Zionist movement. The declaration stated:
{{quote|His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.}}Thus, when Palestine was captured in December some part of it was designated as an area of Jewish settlement. It was not as much as the Zionists would have liked, but it was the first official recognition of the Zionist movement.

==[[w:British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]==
After the war ended, the Allied powers began to partition up the Ottoman Empire, as had been their plan for several years. With the Balfour Declaration in mind, the region they dubbed Palestine was set aside as a Jewish &quot;National Home&quot;. However, the intention of the Allies was not to expel those already living in Palestine, but only to state as policy that other groups should make room for the Jews. The final mandate read, in part, as follows:
{{quote|Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on November 2nd, 1917, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favor of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country [...]}}
The Mandate was implemented in 1922. During next 25 years, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally to Palestine, and many more Jews came illegally.
==Zionism flourishes under the Mandate==

They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.

===The kibbutz movement expands===
During the Mandate, the ''kibbutzim'' of the Second Aliyah became a model for intentional communities throughout Palestine, called the [[w:Settlement movement (Israel)|settlement movement]].
* moshavim shitufiim
* moshavim
* [[w:Communal settlement (Israel)|Communal settlement]]

The ''kibbutzim'' and other intentional communities were considered the pride and joy of Zionism throughout the Mandate years. After Israel became a nation, collectivist kibbutz politics became independent of Zionism in general; fierce debates were held over the desirability of consumerism or affiliation with Germany or Communist Russia. Kibbutzim and other intentionally organized settlements still exist today, encompassing a diverse range of political ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competing school systems===
The British government had no interest in regulating schools, so under the Mandate four different Jewish schooling systems developed from the four major factions of ''olim''. All of these schools accused each other of stealing students and immigrants away, and while all four expressed a desire that the schools one day be unified, they all insisted that their own system must be used in the future unification.

Mandate formalized by league of Nations  September 23, 1922. Jewish reaction was mixed. one group protested the creation of Transjordan-both Western Palestinian Arabs and Jews could not buy land or           settle in Transjordan because the British prohibited it even             though Abdullah was willing        -the incensed Jews formed Revisionist for a unified state. The leader of Revisionists was Vladimir Jabotinsky - a Russian Jew. However, a majority of Jews were satisfied with the mandate

[[w:Sir Herbert Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] was a British Jew who served as first High Commissioner       of Palestine     . Under Samuel's rule the British recognized Vaad Leumi (National Council), Elected Assembly, and          local council representives of Jewish community. He established Hebrew as official language and placed restrictions on Jewish immigration in response to            Arab complaints. (Arabs had no restrictions on their immigration by British.)

People questioned if Israel could support the influx of Jews with the existing Arab population. Arab peasants or laborers called Fellaheen were already being displaced. Zionists claimed that adopting European farming techniques would allow Fellaheen to live on smaller tracts of land.

==Aliyah Bet==
''Aliyah'' to Palestine resumed as soon as World War I was over. During the [[w:Third Aliyah|Third Aliyah]] 35,000 Jews came to the country. They were not motivated by the Zionist World Congress, who in fact opposed the mass migration, but by their own volition after the Balfour Declaration and pogroms in the Russian Civil War.

World War I left much of Western Europe devastated, and antisemitism rose dramatically. From 1924-1928 there was the [[w:Fourth Aliyah|Fourth Aliyah]]: 82,000 Jews, 23,000 left. With the Nazis came the [[w:Fifth Aliyah|Fifth Aliyah]]: 250,000 Jews, and only 20,000 left!  There was also the [[w:Haavara Agreement|Haavara Agreement]] between the Jewish Agency and the Nazis, to bring German Jews to Palestine. As a result of Nazi cooperation, 60,000 Jews came to Palestine.

[[w:Youth Aliyah|Children fleeing the Nazis on their own]] were sent to [[w:Youth village|youth village]]s to be collectively cared for and raised. And not only this, but there was [[w:Aliyah Bet|Aliyah Bet]]: illegal immigration sponsored by covert Zionist groups. 

{{quote|We felt proud and exultant to arrive with the Jewish flag at our mast. The refugees looked for the first time upon the Holy Land with wondering and often tear-filled eyes. This was the sight for which they had longed with all their hearts, the sight for which they had risked their lives crossing one illegal border after another and on the high seas.|I.F. Stone. ''Underground to Palestine''. 1947.}}

==Arab discontent and revolt==
During the Mandate the Jewish population in Palestine rose sharply: a growth rate of 8.6% per year, compared with 2.7% for Christians, Muslims, Druze, and others. The Arab population of Palestine was flummoxed by the number of immigrants, which with the &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; was even greater than Britain's most extreme predictions. Groups like the [[w:Independence Party (Palestine)|Independence Party]] and the [[w:Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]] demanded Arab rule. Starting in 1936, an [[w:1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] demanded an end to Jewish immigration and independence for Palestine. The British government imprisoned many of these Arabs without trial and demolished some of their houses. By the time the strike concluded in March 1939, more than 5,000 Arabs; 400 Jews; and 200 Britons had been killed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intensifying violence: Arabs v. Jews, Jews v. Arabs==
British did not allow Jews to form a fighting unit till Sept. 1940 with 200 men. Sept. 20, 1944 Jewish Brigade formed. to restrict enlistment number of Jews was supposed to equal number of Arabs. Arabs did enlist, mainly inactive during war. end of 1941 more than 10,000 Palestinian Jews joined army. also in 1941 Palmach - peluggot mahaz - &quot;Shock Companies&quot; - created by Haganah Elite Strike Force designed to defen Yishuv in an emergency

Jews increasingly aware that British would not implement Balfour Declaration, i.e., giving Jews a state. May 1942  Zionists meeting at Biltmore Hotel in NY urged Britain to allow Jewish Agency power to form a Jewish State. state not a separate country until a Jewish majority. Agency responsible for country's agriculture and industry

===Jews v. British===
Feb. 1, 1944 Menachim Begin, leader of Irgun declared a Jewish revolt against British. Irgun attacked military targets. Late Feb. 1944 Irgun attacked the offices of Immigration Department  in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. protested closed gates of Palestine

Nov. 1943 20 members of Lehi a.k.a. Stern Gang escaped from Latrun  prison. Nathan Friedmans-Yellin among them, and resurrected Lehi and became  its leader. Lehi believed British wouldn't leave because of oil refinery in  Haifa. They threatened British army installments, camps, interrupted transportation with mines, intimidated soldiers with death threats, patrolled streets till they found a group of British police or soldiers and opened fire on them.

British response:           a. curfews on Jewish cities          b. mass arrests          c. instituting death penalty for carrying firearms          d. underground Jewish forces intensified attacks

Chaim Weizmann sent letter of condolences to a wounded British              soldier. Jewish leadership appalled by killings; afraid violence would jeopardize the creation of a Jewish State. The Jewish Agency feared for their own positions. April 2, 1944 Agency officially declared a policy of opposition             -prevent activities             -increase negative propaganda against &quot;terrorists&quot;

===Yom Kippur 1944===
Begin announced that shofar will be blown at the Western Wall. this had been prohibited since 1929 riots. Sept. 27 shofar sounded and at the same time Irgun attacked 4              different British fortresses. Psychological victory. British did not retaliate.

===Assassination===
Radical elements among the Zionists aimed to assassinate key British leaders as punishment for complicity in Holocaust. 4 attempts on Sir Harold MacMichael all failed. British minister of Cairo, Lord Moyne, former Colonial Secretary.. Nov. 6, 1944 Eliahu Hakim and Eliau Bet-Zouri assassinated Moyne. assassinators both tried and hanged.
==Israel after the Holocaust==
[[File:19450715 Buchenwald survivors arrive in Haifa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Survivors of the Nazi concentration camp [[w:Buchenwald|Buchenwald]] immigrated illegally to Israel.]]
Jewish survivors of [[the Holocaust]] were not taken to Israel but [[w:Sh'erit ha-Pletah|rehabilitated in camps in Europe]]. However, many of these survivors were strongly motivated to leave Europe. Without a legal means of emigration, they turned to &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot; in even greater numbers than before, a movement called [[w:Berihah|Berihah]]. Britain opened [[w:Cyprus internment camps|internment camps in Cyprus]] to house Holocaust survivors they had captured; some were held until 1949. In the [[w:SS Exodus|SS ''Exodus'']] incident, the British Royal Navy seized one of the Berihah ships and sent it back to Germany, causing a media scandal.

Leah Koren of Lublin, now in Israel, is looking for her sister Sheina Friedman, nee Koren.&quot; All were recent immigrants on the threshold of a new life.|Tom Segev, ''1949: The First Israelis''. 1998. pp.ix-x}}
===Holocaust survivors (DPs) and Zionist militancy===
The continuing flow of refugees enraged Arab leaders and, in the eyes of the British, threatened the stability of the region. The British thus refused to accept 100,000 refugees in 1946. In response, militant elements among Hagana, the Irgun, and Lehi kidnapped British officers and [[w:King David Hotel bombing|bombed the King David Hotel]], killing 91 British, Jewish, and Arab employees. The response from leaders in Britain was actually helpful from the Zionists: Churchill announced that he did not see much of a British interest in Palestine, and the general British public began to weigh the costs of a continued occupation.

In October 1946, U.S. President Truman announced his support for the Jewish Agency's partition plan. For the Zionists, a long-awaited victory seemed to be on the way; however, the road from partition to statehood would be a rocky one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==UN Partition==
In 1945 the US Congress adopted a resolution for the restoration of a Jewish Commonwealth. According to a public opinion poll [source?] 65% supported the creation of a Jewish State, and during the third quarter of 1947 White House received 62,850 postcards, 1,100 letters, and 1,400 telegrams urging it to push the UN to adopt the partition plan. Truman reacted negatively to what it perceived as a &quot;Jewish Lobby&quot;. Members of Truman's Administration opposed partition [source?] and undermined U.S. support [source?]. James Forrestal [who?] believed that Zionist aims would bring about a threat to U.S. oil supplies [source?]. Joint Chiefs of Staff thought that Arabs might align with Soviets if they were alienated by the West.

Cuba and Greece voted against although U.S. dependents. U.S. and Soviet Union for the partition. SU wanted British out of Palestine. Asian countries solidly against. Garcia-Grandados of Guatemala and Fabrega of Uruguay were outspoken in their support. The Vatican was subtly against partition. Most of Latin America supported Cuba, El Salvado and Colombia against. Britain was opposed because it was not acceptable to both Jews and Arabs.

The UN was empowered only to make a recommendation, and Britain was under no obligation to carry out the UN plan, although UN member-nations expected Britaln to implement the decision. On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly voted to recommend Partition by a vote of 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions.

6,120 square miles of the 10,400 Palestine was allotted to the new Jewish State. More than half of the Jewish State, some 3,670 square miles, consisted of the Negev Desert. The state itself consisted of three regions, a Northern section, a Coastal section, and Negev, which were connected by narrow corridors of land. International Jerusalem was connected to Jewish State by a narrow road running through the heart of the Arab State.  ~500,000 Jews in Jewish State and ~350, 000 Arabs. ~92,000 Arabs lived in Tiberias, Safed, Haifa, and Bet Shean. 40,000 were Bedouins mostly in Negev. remainder spread throughout and occupied most of the agricultural land.

===Partition Problems===
UN appointed a commission with representatives from Denmark,  Czechoslovakia, Panama, Bolivia, and the Philippines to implement their resolution. British gave notice of their evacuation to be August 1, 1948. it actually happened May 15, 1948. Because Britain was critical of the resolution, it declined to implement it, instead withdrawing from the territory. The UN commission into Palestine was not allowed into the country until 2 weeks prior to the British evacuation, rendering it ineffective.

Open hostilities between Arabs and Jews began with greater intensity. Arabs declared a protest strike and instigated riots- 62 Jews killed, 32 Arabs. end of second week 93 Arabs, 84 Jews, and 7 Englishmen killed and   scores more injured. jurists of Al-Azhar University in Cairo called on Muslim world to            proclaim Jihad against Jews. Minority of Jews not satisfied with having a Jewish State in Palestine; among them were members of Irgun and Lehi

between Nov. 30, 1947 and Feb. 1, 1948 427 Arabs, 381 Jews, and 46     British were killed. Jan. 9, 1948 1,000 Arabs attacked Jewish communities in Northern      Palestine. by Feb. British said so many Arabs infiltrated that they lacked             the forces to run them back. British surrendered bases and arms to Arabs irregulars and Arab             Legion, which was being run by a British commander at the time. this facilitated Arab raids and eventual invasion. British refused to allow the Jews to form a militia to defend            themselves till the termination of the Mandate. Jews couldn't legally form or train an army or import weapons. existing Arab States free to import weapons. British even signed a treaty with Transjordan that provided Arabs             with arms while a blockade was maintained against the Jews   

The King of Jordan expressed his position on what was called the &quot;Jewish Problem&quot; as follows:
{{quote|Our position is so simple and natural that we are amazed it should even be questioned. It is exactly the same position you in America take in regard to the unhappy [case of the] European Jews. You are sorry for them, but you do not want them in your country.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We do not want them in ours, either. Not because they are Jews, but because they are foreigners. We would not want hundreds of thousands of foreigners in our country, be they Englishmen or Norwegians or Brazilians or whatever.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Think for a moment: In the last 25 years we have had one third of our entire population forced upon us. In America that would be the equivalent of 45,000,000 complete strangers admitted to your country, over your violent protest, since 1921. How would you have reacted to that?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because of our perfectly natural dislike of being overwhelmed in our own homeland, we are called blind nationalists and heartless anti-Semites. This charge would be ludicrous were it not so dangerous.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No people on earth have been less &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; than the Arabs. The persecution of the Jews has been confined almost entirely to the Christian nations of the West. Jews, themselves, will admit that never since the Great Dispersion did Jews develop so freely and reach such importance as in Spain when it was an Arab possession. With very minor exceptions, Jews have lived for many centuries in the Middle East, in complete peace and friendliness with their Arab neighbours.|King Abdullah of Jordan. [http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/kabd_eng.html &quot;As the Arabs see the Jews&quot;]. November 1947.}}

==Forces in Palestine==
On Feb. 17, 1948 the Palestine Commission told UN Secretary Council that the     partition plan needed military aid to be carried out. Russians insisted on sending a contingent to Palestine if U.S. did, and Truman did not want Russians in Palestine under any circumstances, fearing that Israel would double its problems by becoming a front in the Cold War. Other countries in UN did not want to send military forces without the aid of one of the two superpower. Hence, the only outside forces in Palestine by the time of independence were the lackadaisical British.

{{quote|It is now clear, without the slightest doubt, that were we to face the Palestinians alone, everything would be all right.  They, the decisive majority of them, do not want to fight us, and all of them together are unable to stand up to us, and all of them together are unable to stand up to us.|David Ben-Gurion. ''Political and Diplomatic Documents of CZA and ISA, December 1947-May 1948'', p. 128.}}

{{quote|In the event of a conflict, not only can the Jews defend themselves, but they will defeat the Palestinian Arabs.|Winston Churchill, quoted in ''History of the Haganah'' p. 820}}

The combined troops of seven Arab nations would sound like a formidable force, but initially there were only 20,000 to 23,500-- outnumbered by 25,000 to 30,000 standing Israeli forces, plus the Jewish paramilitary groups of [[w:Lehi (group)|Lehi]], [[w:Irgun|Irgun]], and [[w:Gadna (Israel)|Gadna]], and the [[w:Jewish Settlement Police|Jewish Settlement Police]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Kurzman, &quot;Genesis 1948&quot;, 1970, p.282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simha Flapan. ''The Birth of Israel: Myths And Realities''. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, the Arabs sent more of their armies to Palestine, but Israeli forces were supported by Jewish ''olim'' recruits from across Europe, who started arriving in enormous numbers within 48 hours of independence.

After May 15 most of the underground Jewish resistance was absorbed into the [[w:Haganah|Haganah]], which had been redubbed the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). On May 28 Lehi formally disbanded when 850 of its fighters joined the IDF.

The U.S. on Dec. 5, 1947 imposed an arms embargo on Palestine; neither Jews nor Arabs could buy weapons, and British only sold weapons to Arabs.

The fighting ended on July 15. 6,500 Israelis had died, and most of Israel's irrigated agricultural land had become useless waste. Meanwhile, [[w:List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War|hundreds of Arab towns had been ethnically cleansed]] by IDF forces. Particularly memorable to Palestinians today is the village of [[w:Deir Yassin|Deir Yassin]], where the entire population was massacred by paramilitary groups.

==Ceasefire==
After Israel had won its independence, its diplomats approached the leaders of each of the Arab nations to work out a formal armistice agreement. Rather than drawing up permanent lines, the parties decided to create &quot;temporary&quot; borders based on where the armies were standing at the end of the war. The borders established by these agreements are called the [[w:Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].

Rather than translating into a peace treaty, the ceasefire was extremely shallow and left the question of Israel's future security and ambitions unresolved, a problem that was unsettling to both sides. This was a purposeful decision on the part of David Ben-Gurion, who was an [[w:Offensive realism|offensive realist]] who believed that Israel's military might made any possible compromise a needless concession to the weaker states surrounding it, and that in due time Israel's neighbors would be forced to recognize it and rely on it for trade and security. Ben-Gurion's main adversary was [[w:Eliyahu Sasson|Eliyahu Sasson]], who believed that face-saving concessions such as allowing Arabs to remain in their villages and giving the Negev to Egypt were necessary for Israel to gain acceptance in the Arab community. Sasson wrote that &quot;the Egyptians keep reiterating that they regarded the armistice agreement as only the first step to the future. It is essential that both you ([[w:Moshe Sharett|Moshe Sharett]]) and Ben-Gurion devote all your strength towards peace, as you did toward defense.&quot; This position was thought to be naive and not serious enough.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.28-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The armistice lines were unsatisfying for both parties. Most Zionists felt like the Green Line was waiving part of the Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were deported from their villages and ''kibbutzim'' on the Jordanian and Egyptian sides, and Arabs were deported from villages on the Israeli side (see Refugees below). On both sides, villages were subsequently demolished to assuage the fears on both sides that people would attempt to reclaim their homes by force. Heavily populated regions and villages were split in two by the line, which was drawn on a relatively small map that lacked ownership data. For example, the town of [[w:Barta'a|Barta'a]] became 1/3 Israeli and 2/3 Jordanian; today, the town has a wall running through it that is open for only a few minutes every day.

==Refugees==
[[File:Palestinian refugees.jpg|thumb|right|Palestinian refugees in 1948]]
{{quote|Yigal Allon asked Ben-Gurion what was to be done with the civilian population. Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture of &quot;drive them out.&quot; &quot;Driving out&quot; is a term with a harsh ring. Psychologically, this was one of the most difficult actions we undertook. The population of Lydda did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the ten or fifteen miles to the point where they met up with the Arab Legion.|''Service Diary'', quoted in David Shipler, in the ''New York Times'' of 10/22/1979}}
{{quote|May 13, 1948, is a day that will remain forever engraved in my memory. That day, less than twenty four hours before the proclamation of the Israeli state, my family fled Jaffa for refuge in Gaza. We had been under siege: the Zionist forces controlled all the roads leading south, and the only escape left open to us was the sea. It was under a hail of shells fired from Jewish artillery set up in neighboring settlements, especially Tel Aviv, that I clambered onto a makeshift boat with my parents, my four brothers and sisters, and other relatives. [...]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The boat had scarcely lifted anchor when a woman started shrieking. One of her four children wasn't on board and she implored us to put back to port to look for him. Caught under the heavy fire of the Jewish guns, we couldn't turn back without risking the lives of the several hundred people, many of them children, crushed together in the small craft.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The piercing cries of the poor woman went unanswered. She broke down into sobs. Some of us tried to calm her by saying that her son would surely be picked up and later brought to Gaza. But in vain. Her nerves finally cracked and she straddles the rail, throwing herself into the sea. In an apparent effort to save her, her husband jumped in after her. It soon became apparent that neither knew how to swim. The angry waves finally swallowed them up under our very eyes. We all remained rooted to the boat, paralyzed with horror.|Abu Iyad. ''My Home, My Land''. 1948.}}
{{quote|One of my schoolfriends was a Jewish girl named Dvora; she was very sweet, and I loved her. One day, she invited me home, and I went along. When we neared her house I suddenly realized where she was taking me: her family now occupied my aunt's house! My shock was redoubled when I went inside and found my aunt's pictures still hanging on the walls; it was on my aunt's piano that Dvora practiced. I even found a doll I used to play with!|Raymonda Tawil ''My Home, My Prison.'' As quoted in ''Seder of the Children of Abraham''}}

Roughly 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled Israel during the war of independence, for reasons that are still nder dispute. They arrived in the West Bank and Gaza strip without homes, possessions, or jobs. During the same timespan, nearly 600,000 Jews arrived in Israel from various Arab states, which they had also left for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Christian city of [[w:Kafr Bir'im|Kafr Bir'im]] was one of many completely razed during the war. The records for this city are unusually clear: they show that the IDF told the entire village to move to [[w:Jish|Jish]], which had itself been depopulated of its Arab inhabitants. Those who did not leave were dragged to the Jordan border and told to walk across to Jordan, but once the IDF left they walked to Jish instead. In 1972 the people of Bir'im occupied their city, which had been completely emptied, and once again the IDF forcibly removed them to Jish. In 1977 [[w:Menachem Begin|Menachem Begin]] promised the people of Bir'im the right to return if he was elected. They elected him but he decided not to let them return.

    D. International Aid
       i. UN Gerneral Assembly voted on November 19, 1948 to establish the 
          United Nations Relief for Palestinian Refugees (UNRPR) to dispense 
          aid
       ii. UNRPR replaced by United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on 
           Dec. 8, 1949 with a budget of $50 million
          a. substitute public works for direct relief
          b. promote economic development
          c. direct relief would be almost completely replaced by public works 
             with the remaining assistance provided by Arab governments
       iii. UNRWA little chance for success
          a. Arab refugees and Arab states were not prepared to cooperate on 
             the large-scale development projects
          b. Arab governments and refugees unwilling to contribute to any plan 
             that could be interpreted as fostering resettlement, instead they 
             wanted refugees to be repatriated
       iv. Jewish refugees from Arab countries received no international 
           assistance
       v.  Palestinians received millions of dollars through UNRWA
          a. initially U.S. $25 million, Israel ~ $3 million, Arab pledges ~ 
             $600,000
          b. U.S. still largest contributer and Arab nations donate less than 
             5% of UNRWA budget
    E. Where to go?
       i. Jordan was the only Arab country to welcome the Palestinians and 
          grant them citizenship
       ii. King Abdullah considered Jordanians and Palestinian Arabs one 
           people
       iii. by 1950 Abdullah annexed the West Bank and forbade the use of the 
            term Palestine in official documents
       iv. 1952 UNRWA set up a fund of $200 million to provide homes and jobs  
           for Palestinian refudees but it went untouched

      <text xml:space="preserve">Israel faced many problems in between 1949 and 1967. The ethnic cleansing of Arab towns had (temporarily) set aside the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but impoverished Jewish refugees from angered Arab nations created an entirely new set of ethnic problems, and the deeply divided government was barely functioning.

==Jews in Arab Countries==
More than a thousand Jews were killed in antisemitic rioting during the 1940's in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Yemen which helped trigger the mass exodus of Jews from Arab countries. The [[w:Law of Return|Law of Return]] provided all Jews the legal right to immigrate to Israel and immediately become citizens of Israel if they choose to do so. the only exception are those whom the Minister of Interior considers a threat to the public health, welfare, or security of the state

The Right to Return was not written until 1950, but hours after the declaration of independence, ''olim'' came flooding in. There were 100,000 in the first six months, then over 250,000 in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
June 1941: Mufti of Jerusalem, who had fled Palestine, inspired the pro-Nazi coup of Rashid Ali. this sparked rioting and a pogrom in Baghdad. Jews had lived in Iraq for 2,700 years. armed Iraqi mobs with the complicity of the police and the army . murdered 180 Jews and wounded almost 1,000. additional outbreaks 1946-49. after establishment of Israel in 1948, Zionism became a capital. In 1950, Iraqi Jews were permitted to leave the country within a year, provided that they forfeit their citizenship. 1951 the property of Jews who emigrated from Iraq was frozen and economic restrictions were placed on the remaining Jews.

From 1949-1951 Jews were evacuated from Iraq in Operations Ezra and Nehemiah. another 20,000 were smuggled out through Iran. 1952 Iraq's government barred Jews from emigrating. Jews were publicly hanged after false charges of hurling a bomb at the Baghdad office of the US Information Agency

1944 after Syria gained independence from France, the new government banned Jewish emigration to Palestine. the teaching of Hebrew in Jewish schools was severely restricted. attacks escalated and boycotts were called against Jewish    businesses. 1947 after partition, Arab mobs in Aleppo destroyed the 2,500 year old community. scores of Jews were killed. over 200 homes, shops, and synagogues were destroyed. thousands of Jews illegally fled Syria to go to Israel. Jews only minority group whose passports identified their religion. freedom of movement was severly restricted. Jews who tried to flee faced either the death penalty of    imprisonment at hard labor. Jews could not have government or bank jobs. Jews could not acquire telephones of driver's licenses, and could not purchase property. Jewish bank accounts were frozen. the Jewish cemetary in Damascus was paved over to build an airport road. Jewish schools were closed and handed over to Muslims

{{quote|It's been said that there were cases of rape in Ramlah. I can forgive rape, but I will not forgive other acts which seem to me much worse. When they enter a town and forcibly remove rings from the fingers and jewelry from someone's neck, that's a very grave matter... Many are guilty of it.|[[w:Mordehai Bentov|Mordehai Bentov]], recorded in Minutes of Cabinet Meetings on 4 July 1948.}}
Across the world, from Burma to America, Jews were emigrated to Israel by diplomats and Mossad agents-- usually at expensive prices as part of an economic deal. These early immigration movements did not distinguish between ethnicities such as Sephardic and Arabic, focusing only on the political and economic situations of the Jewish populations of each country, and emphasizing communities in distress. In Morocco, for example, the Jewish Agency found an entire village that had gone blind due to trachoma.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries did not want their Jews to leave at all. In these instances Mossad arranged secret smuggling operations on cargo boats, camels, and caravans. However, Mossad also extracted profits from Zionist agencies for each new ''olim'', and made a habit of filling every boat to capacity and bringing in ''olim'' ahead of schedule. By 1952 it was disbanded and replaced with an official Secret Service.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.95-113&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Those from Europe, including Romania and Hungary, have no pioneering spirit at all. They expect a life of luxury and will live only in the city. [They] do not learn the language. ... Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, and Tripolitanians: Most of them speak Hebrew, having belonged to pioneering, Zionist movements (especially the Iraqis and Iranians). Their ambition is to live on the land, in some cases even in kibbutzim.|Ruth Klieger, report to the Prime Minister's Office}}

Immigration to the new state of Israel rose to four times the maximum estimated capacity. Survivors of pogroms came to Israeli ports only to be offloaded into squalid camps, and ironically deloused with sprays of DDT, akin to Nazi concentration camps. Medical assistance was nonexistent, floors were covered in human waste, food portions were meager-- sometimes only bread, milk, and a few olives-- and inhabitants were kept in the camps for months on end. Once immigrants left the camps, the kibbutzim and other agricultural systems were also overwhelmed with applicants and trainees. When the camps were shut down in 1949, ''olim'' were scattered around Israel to work for their food.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.117-138&lt;/ref&gt;


===Operation Magic Carpet===

But Israel was similarly unprepared for another influx of ''olim'' from Yemen, [[w:Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]]; a doctor described 12,000 starving immigrants, many of them naked or half-naked, crowded into a &quot;transit&quot; site that was meant to hold 500 without as much as a tent to protect them from the elements. This reflected not only the slow progress of systematizing ''aliyah'' but also the conditions in Yemen, where child mortality was estimated at 80 percent, most of the population was constantly sick, and surviving children were quickly married to other Jews to prevent them from being kidnapped by the sultan and converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, pp.182-185&lt;/ref&gt; While Israel was not an immediate improvement over Yemen, Zionist agencies quickly began discussing an investnment in the future of the Yemenites, aiming to improve literacy, women's rights, health and social conditions. It was written in a Jewish Agency pamphlet that &quot;we must not allow them to become ... the shoeshine boys of our society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Segev 1986, p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

Even years after the fact, opinions about the outcome of Operation Magic Carpet were mixed:

{{quote|There were Yemenite children who knew entire chapters of the Bible by heart, and I, a Hebrew teacher, taught them as if they didn't know any Hebrew, because their accent differed from mine. And what did I teach them?--The cat sat on the mat. I did them harm. Today I feel that it was a disaster, not only to the immigrants but to the entire community.|Rabbi Kalmann Kahana&lt;ref&gt;229&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|Nowhere in the world has there ever been such an educational enterprise, in such dimensions ... an entire educational system was created for them out of nothing, and it was done at a time of economic hardship, in the midst of an international struggle and a military threat against the very existence the state. That's what that was!|Dr. Baruch Ben-Yehuda&lt;ref&gt;229&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Government==
Government formed in 1948 included representatives from all the various segements of the          Zionist movement, religious factions, and anti-Zionists. to assure this unity, secular leaders had to make consessions           guaranteeing that aspects of Jewish law would be institutionalized        in the new government such as:  observance of Shabbos and dietary laws.

A constitution was first proposed in 1949. Leftists objected on the basis that the document did not declare              the basis of the State to be Socialism. Religious factions feared that a written consitution would cement          the values of secular Zionism. They argued that constitution was not necessary because the Torah was              in essence the constitution

U.S. officials were concerned that Israel might not be a democracy, as many Jews came from parts of the Soviet Union, and a large percentage of these were associated with socialist political parties and ideologies. American policymakers feared Israel would become a Soviet ally -           particularly those policymakers hostile toward Zionism in the  first place. The Soviet Union was key to the adoption of the partition resolution in the United Nations. The USSR was also second nation to recognize Israel, after the US.

Israeli government pursued some socialist economic policies: state ownership of major institutions             -airline             -telephone company             -utilities. But Israel was committed to the western democratic camp and had rejected          communism. As a result, the USSR then turned on Israel and supported Israel's enemies     politically, economically, and militarily

==Jordan==
    A. Before UN partition vote, Golda Meir was sent by Ben-Gurion to met with 
       King Abdullah
       i. they agreed Jews would not object to Adbullah annexing the area 
          allocated for the Arab State
       ii. Meir met Abdullah in Amman with the hope that Jordan would not 
           enter the impending war
       iii. Abdullah told Meir he allied himself with the other Arab states
    B. Jordan in Jerusalem
       i. Jordan heavily subsidized by British government and its army
       ii. Arab Legion was trained, supported and led by British officers
       iii. this Arab force was the one that the Jews were not able to expell 
            during the War of Independence
       iv. Transjordan was in control of a large amount of territory west of 
           the Jordan river AKA the West Bank and half of the city of 
           Jerusalem including the Old City
          a. Abdullah made it clear that the Jews were not allowed access to 
             holy places like the Kotel
          b. UN, Vatican, and other who had expressed concern as to the future 
             of Jerusalem and with it the freedom of all to worship there soon 
             did not keep interest
       v. Abdullah's decision to annex parts of Palestine that he conquered 
          angered fellow Arabs
          a. Abdullah ignored this and renamed the area the Hashemite Kingdom 
             of Jordan after his family the Hashemites
       vi. Israel doubled its poplation through immigration as Jordan did the 
           same by unifying the territory on both sides of the Jordan River
    C.  Interesting to Note
       i. on May 11, 1949 Israel was admitted as the 59th member on the UN
       ii. Jordan's application was vetoed by the Soviet Union two years 
           earlier because the Russians believed Abdullah was a British puppet

==Arab Boycott==
    A. declared on Dec. 9, 1945 by the Arab League Council
       i. stated &quot;Jewish products and manufactured goods shall be considered 
          undesirable to the Arab Countries.&quot;
       ii. this is before Israel was declared a State and even before the UN 
           voted for partition
       iii. Jewish was the term used as opposed to Zionist
    B. The boycott had three categories
       1. boycott prohibits direct trade between Israel and the Arab nations
       2. companies doing business in Israel
       3. blacklisting of firms that trade with other companies doing business 
          in Israel
          a. Coca-Cola was sold in Israel so Arabs countries boycotted the 
             company
          b. Pepsi stayed away from Israel and continued to do business in 
             Israel
    C. Economics in Israel
       i. at this time Israel did not have the resources to easily and quickly 
          absorb so many immigrants
       ii. years later many immigrants who grew up in ma'abarot -camps of tin 
           shacks and tents- harbored resentment towards the government for 
           its failure to ease their transition
    D. 1977 US Congress Prohibited US Companies From Cooperating With The Arab 
       Boycott
       i. President Carter
       ii. Carter mentioned that the boycott affected Jewish members of the 
           American society and that it was the antagonist to free trade
    E. US Foreign Policy
       i. Truman replaced by Eisenhower
         a. after 1948 War, Truman began a modest foreign aid program for 
            Israel, Ike quickly reduced that amount
         b. Ike used the aid to extract concessions from the Israelis 
            throughout his term
             -for example, 1955 payments were suspended to force Israel to 
              stop work on a hydroelectric project on the Jordan river
        c. Ike refused to sell weapons to Israel
        d. when Israel formally moved the foreign ministry and other       
           government institutions to the capital, Jerusalem, Eisenhower 
           criticized the decision and refused to move the US Embassy from Tel 
           Aviv - where it still remains!! [http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/IsraelUSEmbassy Petition]
    F. Eisenhower's New Middle East Policy Would Influence American 
       Decision-Makers For The Remainder Of The Century
       a. Ike decided that the Middle East was vital to American security 
          interests because of the oil reserves
       b. Ike also worried about the spread of Communism in Middle East
    G. Building of Alliances in the Middle East 
       a. Baghdad Pact 1955 - pro-Western regimes in Turkey and Iraq
       b. later that year Great Britain, Iran, and Pakistan joined creating 
          the Middle East Treaty Organization which later became the Central 
          Treaty Organization
       c. US wanted Egypt to become part of the Alliance
          -US prepared to offer Nasser arms and aid if his country joined
          -British opposed to this because of Suez
       d. Nasser actively opposed the alliance and began undermining it
       e. US did not join the Baghdad Pact
       f. Aswan Dam - 1955 Eisenhower offered to help Egypt build the Aswan 
          Dam
          -Nasser felt the project would give outsiders too much influence 
           over his economy
          -eventually Nasser decided to accept the offer in July 1956
          -July 19 US formally withdrew its offer
       g. a few days after Nasser learned of US withdrawal, Nasser nationalized 
          the Suez Canal
          -France and Great Britain were furious
          -US condemned Nasser but cautioned its allies against military  
           reaction
==Suez Canal==
    A. Egypt Closed the Suez Canal to Israeli Shipping After Signing the 
       Armistice Agreement
       i. August 9, 1949 UN Mixed Armistice Commission upheld Israel's 
          complaint that Egypt was illegally blocking the canal
       ii. September 1, 1967 the Security Council ordered Egypt to open the 
           canal to Israeli shipping
       iii. Egypt refused to comply
    B. Egypt &quot;attacks&quot; Israel
       i. 1955 Nasser began to import weapons from the Soviet Bloc to build 
          his arsenal for a confrontation with Israel
       ii. in the short-term Nasser used a different tactic announced on 
           August 31, 1955 &quot;Egypt has decided to dispatch her heroes, the 
           disciples of Pharaoh and the sons of Islam, and they will cleanse 
           the land of Palestine... There will be no peace on Israel's border 
           because we demand vengeance, and vengeance is Israel's death.&quot;
       iii. Egypt sent fedayeeh - Arab terrorists - trained and equipped by 
            Egyptian Intelligence to engage in hostile action on the border 
            and infiltrate Israel to commit acts of sabotage and murder
       iv. the fedayeen mostly operated from bases in Jordan so that Jordan 
           would feel the brunt of Israel's retaliation
       v. these terrorist attacks violated the armistice agreement yet the UN 
          Security Council condemned Israel for its counter-attacks
       vi. 1953 Israel had created a secret unit to retaliate against the 
           fedayeen
          -it infiltrated their bases and struck both preemptively and 
           vengefully
          -Unit 101, as it was called, was led by Ariel Sharon
       vii. Egyptian blockade of Straits of Tiran - Israel's only supply route 
            with Asia
       viii. Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in July, 1956
       ix. October 25, 1956 Egypt signed a tripartite agreement with Syria and 
           Jordan which put Nasser in command of the three armies
    B. Canal Plans
       i. British and French not happy with Nasser over situation
       ii. the French had grown close to new Israeli government; politically, 
           militarily, and diplomatically
          -French became Israel's primary source of arms for about a decade 
           and provided Israel key elements that let Israel develop a nuclear 
           capability
          -British still allied with Jordan and not friendly with Israel
       iii. French decided that they could use Israel's fear of Egyptian 
            aggression and the continuing blockade as a pretext for their own 
            strike against Nasser
       iv. British decided to join in
       v. the three countries agreed on a plan whereby Israel would land 
          paratroopers near the Canal and send its armor across the Sinai 
          dessert. The British and French troops would be deployed to 
          &quot;protect&quot; the canal
       vi. October 29, 1956 Israel attacked Egypt eighth days before the US 
           presidential election
       vii. more than 100,000 Israeli soldiers were mobilized in less than 72 
            hours and the air force was fully operational within 43. 
            Paratroopers landed in the Sinai and Israeli forces quickly 
            advanced unopposed toward the Suez Canal then halted in compliance 
            with the demands of England and France
       viii. the Egyptians ignored the Anglo-French ultimatum to withdraw 
             because they were asked to retreat from the Sinai to the west 
             bank of the canal, whereas the Israelis were permitted to stay 
             only 10 miles east of the canal
       ix. US sponsored a Security Resolution calling for an immediate Israeli
           withdrawal on October 30
       x. England and France vetoed the resolution
       xi. the next day France and England launched air operations, bombing 
           Egyptian airfields near Suez. Israeli forces continued fighting 
           after this. The IDF's armored corps swept across the dessert 
           capturing the entire Sinai peninsula by November 5
       xii. Nov. 5 British and French paratroops landed near Port Said and 
            amphibious ships dropped commandos onshore. British troops 
            captured Port Said and advanced within 25 miles of Suez city 
            before the British government abruptly agreed to a cease-fire
       xiii. by the end of the fighting, Israel had the Gaza Strip and had 
             advanced as far as Sharm al-Sheikh along the Red Sea
       ivx. a total of 231 Israeli soldiers died in the fighting

== Weapons to Israel==
    A. US/Kennedy
       i. main source of weapons to Israel was France
       ii. US encouragement of 3rd party arms suppliers that had enabled 
           Israel to meet its defense needs
       iii. US was supplying weapons directly like recoilless rifles to 
            Israel, but secretly
       iv. not until 1962 did Israel receive its first major weapons system 
           from US
           a. Kennedy agreed to sell HAWK anti-aircraft missiles
           b. state department opposed this but Kennedy justified this because 
              Nasser had been supplied long-range bombers from the Soviet 
              Union
           c. the HAWK system required IDF soldiers to be given extensive 
              training in the US and that spare parts be supplied to Israel
    B. Johnson
       i. almost immediately after inheriting the presidency, Johnson was 
          pressured by Israelis and lobbyists to supply Israel with tanks and 
          planes
       ii. 1964 Johnson Administration began to consider a tank sale, but the 
           Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that Israel had no need for tanks
           a. they felt US should place a higher priority on restraining the 
              flow of weapons to the Middle East
           b. Joint Chiefs of Staff said that if it was decided to sel tanks 
              then they should only be sold as replacements for obsolete tanks 
              and that they be supplied discreetly
           c. this became impossible when...
       iii. 1965 is was revealed that US had been indirectly supplying arms to 
            Israel via West Germany since 1962 under the terms of a secret 
            agreement made 1960
          a. Arab Nations resonded to this by threatening to recognize East 
             Germany and by pressuring West Germany to halt sales
          b. US stepped in to fulfill the remainder of the contract
       iv. US policy was of even-handedness
          a. it had a similar sale of tanks to Jordan
          b. the administration did not supply large amounts of weapons to 
             either the Arabs or Israelis
          c. Johnson did not want to provide one state with a military 
             advantage over another
       v. February 1966 the US State Department announced the sale of 200 
          Patton Tanks to Israel
       vi. then in May it announced a new agreement for Skyhawk jet bombers to 
           be supplied to Israel
          a. first sale of offensive weapons to Israel
          b. public acknowledgement that US was willing and actually providing 
             the weapons
== Beginning of PLO==
    A. 1963 Palestine Liberation Organization, started by the Arab League
       i. the Palestine Liberation Army was established by Ahmed Shukeiri when   
          he was asked to wage a terror campaign
       ii. the PLO has different groups like
          a. Fatah - Yasir Arafat's group
          b. the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
       iii. 1964 during a meeting for the first Palestinian Congress the PLO 
            formally came into being as an effort to give a voice to the 
            Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon
       iv. Nasser had some influence over these factions
       v. the key articles laid out in the Palestine National Charter or 
          Palestinian Covenant called for the destruction of Israel
    B. Fighting
       i. 1965 35 raids conducted in Israel
       ii. 1966 41
       iii. first 4 months of 1967 37 attacks
       iv. targets of these attacks were always civilians
       v. the majority of the attacks were from Palestinian guerillas entering 
          Israel from Jordan, the Gaza Strip, and Lebanon
          a. the orders for these attacks were coming from Cairo and Damascus
          b. Nasser's objective was to harass the Israelis and to undermine 
             King Hussein's regime in Jordan
       vi. Hussein viewed the PLO as a direct and indirect threat to his power
          a. he closed the PLO offices in Jerusalem in 1967 and arrested many 
             of the group's members
== Syria==
    A. Syria became more hostile after the breakup of the United Arab Republic
       i. the Syrian army used the Golan Heights, being 3,000 feet above the 
          Galilee to shell Israeli farms and villages
       ii. in 1965 and 1966 Syria's attacks gew so frequent that children

           shelters
    B. Israel repeatedly protested Syria's bombardment to the UN Mixed 
       Armistice Commission
       i. the UN Mixed Armistice Commission was in charge of policing the 
          Armistice
       ii. nothing was done to stop Syrian agression
       iii. Israel instead was condemned by the United Nations when it 
            retailiated
    C. Retailiation
       i. April 7, 1967 Israeli planes shot down 6 Syrian fighter planes - 
          these Syrian planes MiGs were supplied by the Soviet Union
       ii. soon after the Soviets - who had been providing military and 
           economic assistance to Syria and Egypt - gave Damascus information 
           alleging a massive Israeli military buildup in preparation for an 
           attack
          a. Israel denied this claim repeatedly
          b. Syria decided to invoke a defense treaty with Egypt and asked 
             Nasser to come to its aid

            stationed in the Sinai since 1956 to withdraw
          a. Secretary General U. Thant complied with the demand
          b. Thant did not bring the matter to the attention of the General 
             Assembly like he was supposed to do
       iv. May 22, Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran to all Israeli shipping 
           and all ships traveling to Eilat
          a. this cut off Israel's only supply route with Asia
          b. it also stopped the flow of oil from Israel's main supplier, Iran
          c. President Johnson, of the US, expressed the belief that the 
             blockade was illegal and tried unsuccessfully to test it
          d. Johnson also advised Israel not to take any military action
       v. Nasser challanged Israel to fight almost daily after the blockade
       vi. May 30, King Hussein of Jordan signed a defense pact with Egypt

            Israel is an error which be be rectified. This is our opportunity 
            to wipe out the ignoming which has been with us since 1948. Our 
            goal is clear - to wipe Israel off the map.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">At the beginning of 1967, Israel was facing multiple crises at once. An economic recession had drained consumer confidence. Large-scale immigration of [[w:Mizrahim|Mizrahim]] (Middle Eastern and Asian Jews) had created a class divide and sparked worry about Israel's future as a progressive, Western democracy. The atmosphere of the entire country was one of malaise and anxiety over the future of the Zionist project.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, not only did Israelis have cause for celebration, their attitude towards Zionist and foreign affairs had changed dramatically, and they had set a very different course for Israel on the international stage. Whether this was a change for the better, though, is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran politician Simha Flapan explained his concerns in retrospect:{{quote|With the blitz victory in 1967 and the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, the sudden expansion of Israel's borders gave rise to a more rapid erosion of the socialist and humanist values that had once been the hallmark of labor Zionism: prominent political leaders, poets, writers, and intellectuals, whose roots had been in the labor movement, joined the new, dynamic [[w:Greater Israel|Greater Israel]] movement, which sought to turn Israel's most recent conquests into an integral part of the country.|Simha Flapan}}
==Build-up to war==
Jerusalem, ignored by the Tel Aviv elite, lay in a divided and sometimes quixotic state. Jordanian soldiers would fire on tourists taking pictures of them; adventurous scavengers sometimes stepped on land mines in the no-man's-land; Israeli Arabs could only meet their Palestinian relatives at irregularly determined times in a square between the [[w:Mandelbaum Gate|Mandelbaum Gate]] and its Jordanian counterpart; and the Western Wall was open only to foreign tourists, not even to the most pious Israeli.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Quarter of the Old City, under Jordanian control, was scheduled to be turned into a park. Fifty-two of the fifty-three synagogues in the Quarter were razed and turned into henhouses or horse stables.&lt;ref&gt;LETTER DATED 5 MARCH 1968 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF ISRAEL TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL&lt;/ref&gt;

PLO forms, 1964. Fatah begins bombings, 1965. Meanwhile, in 1963 the IDF had formed a plan code-named Whip to capture and occupy the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 1966, three Israeli soldiers are killed near Hebron. Israel responds with [[w:Samu Incident|Operation Shredder]], destroying dozens of homes and wounding or killing 100 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Segev 2007, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six-Day War==
On May 16, 1967, Nasser ordered UN peacekeepers to leave the Egyptian border, and Secretary [[w:U Thant|Thant]] complied. Israel considered this tantamount to declaring war. Putting the peacekeepers on the Israeli side of the border was not seriously considered because it would cause Israel to lose face. The Israeli cabinet, dominated by hawks, began preparing for war-- interestingly, the two most powerful individuals opposed to the war, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ben-Gurion, specifically refused to interfere with the war planning efforts. Johnson stayed out of discussions in order to maintain neutrality on Israeli politics, even though the cabinet spent three weeks trying to obtain approval or disapproval from him before finally deciding to declare war without it, and Ben-Gurion did the same because he had retired from politics, even though individual members of the Knesset were calling for him to be reinstated as prime minister to resolve the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp.225-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the general population of Israel, unaware of these back room deals, were panicking over the prospect of war, which most newspapers were reporting as inevitable. Runs on grocery stores cleared the aisles of bread and milk. Some Israelis fled overseas to live with relatives, and many dug trenches around their homes and installed bomb shelters in their basements. The tension throughout the country was palpable, although the soldiers guarding the front lines were much less fearful than civilians.&lt;ref&gt;op.cit&lt;/ref&gt;
===Day 1===
On June 5, the Israeli air force unexpectedly bombed the air forces of Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, demolishing 400 planes in less than 24 hours. Because this attack took the opposing forces by surprise and no resistance was put up, Israeli commanders considered the war virtually won by the day's end. Eshkol had offered King Hussein the option of staying out of the war (which would have left the West Bank and Jerusalem peaceful under Jordanian control), but surprisingly, he chose to launch shells at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv instead. Hussein's army was disorganized--&quot;amateurish&quot;, according to Odd Bull--and the Syrians did not even bother to counterattack. The Israelis, though, did sustain dozens of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp.338-350&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day 2===
On June 6, the cabinet seriously took up the matter of whether it was going to capture the Old City of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Both were a very dangerous prize: they were politically crucial to Jordan and full of impoverished refugees holding mortal grudges from the War of Independence, and yet once taken, the Israeli people would not permit the government to surrender them. Eshkol, considering these dangers, was hesitant to actually propose that the IDF march on Jerusalem. [[w:Menachem Begin|Menachem Begin]], who would later become Prime Minister, said that the IDF was charged with &quot;liberating the eastern part of western Eretz Israel&quot; (implying that Jordan itself would soon be &quot;liberated&quot;), and suggested that the entire Knesset march to the Western Wall with two rabbis and recite a prayer. General [[w:Moshe Dayan|Moshe Dayan]] offered a rather incautious compromise of surrounding the Old City without conquering it immediately, which was implicitly accepted when the meeting adjourned.&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp.351-365&lt;/ref&gt;
===Day 3===
On June 7, the Egyptian forces in Jerusalem had fled the city--only their abandoned shoes remained. Begin, impatient after hearing of a cease-fire, called Dayan, who impulsively ordered a march on Jerusalem (upsetting high-ranking generals stationed in other parts of the country, who wanted to be there for the historic event). At 10 in the morning Israeli flags were planted atop the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall, causing an impromptu celebration. Thousands of exuberant Israelis flooded the Old City. Zionists were punch-drunk on the feeling of victory: the chaplain of the IDF and soon to be Chief Rabbi of Israel, [[w:Shlomo Goren|Shlomo Goren]], advised General Uzi Narkis to demolish the Dome of the Rock. Narkis harshly rebuked him, and Dayan ordered the Israeli flag removed from the Dome. Meanwhile, Ben-Gurion's instinctive reaction on hearing the news was to begin resettling the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, and he began arranging for this immediately. When he saw a street sign near the Western Wall labelled &quot;Alborak&quot; in Arabic, he demanded that it be taken down, and although he had no political power nearby soldiers followed his orders. His other demand, to demolish the slums and public toilets near the wall, was carried out by Narkis before the end of the war. Narkis actually advised a contractors' association to demolish the houses so that Israel would not be legally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pp.366-384, 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
The final three days were comparatively inconsequential. An American spy vessel, the [[w:USS Liberty incident|USS Liberty]], was mistakenly attacked by the Israeli Air Force. Although some see a malicious motive in this attack, most historians (and both governments) consider it just one of many operational errors during the course of the war. The IDF seized the Golan Heights; Syria destroyed several kibbutzim in response. Both Jordan and Syria, apparently overwhelmed, requested a cease-fire, and in response Israel claimed more territory. After six days, Israeli forces were in position to march on Cairo, Damascus and Amman. The march was only halted because the Soviet Union was threatening to intervene in what appeared to be an immense upheaval in the fragile Middle Eastern balance of power. The US Secretary of State, Dean Rusk advised the Israelis to accept a cease-fire, and taking into consideration the costs of attacking the capitals, they did so on June 10.

During the war, 776 Israelis died, as did 15,000 Egyptians, 2,500 Syrians, and 800 Jordanians. Israel conquered enough land to triple the 8,000 square miles that it previously controlled to 26,000 square miles. More than 9,000 Palestinian families were reunited in 1967, and ultimately more than 60,000 Palestinians were allowed to return. But a new refugee population had been created and the old refugee problem was made worse. 90 percent of the Jordan Valley was evacuated by Palestinians who remembered the events of 1948. While these fears were mostly unfounded, in the villages of [[w:Qalqilyah|Qalqilyah]], [[w:Bayt 'Awa|Bayt 'Awa]], [[w:Hafla|Hafla]], [[w:Jifliq|Jifliq]], [[w:Bayt Nuba|Bayt Nuba]], [[w:Imwas|Imwas]], [[w:Yalu|Yalu]] and [[w:Bayt Mirsim|Bayt Mirsim]], IDF forces demolished hundreds of refugee homes and ordered their inhabitants to walk to somewhere else without any clear justification; some refugees from these towns wandered for four days without food or water, then were sent back to their homes only to watch them being demolished. During a cabinet meeting, Dayan expressed his hope that the entire West Bank would be evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;ibid., pp.405-409&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military victory and diplomatic defeat==
After the end of the war, Arab leaders convened to create a fierce diplomatic response to their defeat. They would no longer recognize Israel, and refuse to negotiate or settle a peace.

US under Johnson imposed an arms embargo on Israel and all of the         Middle East. Arabs later accused the US of airlifting supplied to Israel. France - Israel's main arms supplier also placed an embargo on           Israel. the Soviet Union supplied massive amounts of arms to the Arabs. the armies of Kuwait, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq contributed            to the Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian fronts

The UN Secretary Council unanimously passed a resolution on November          22, 1967 that was meant to provide guidelines for a peace            settlement, but Arabs interpreted the Resolution in a way that placed all the             responsibility for concessions of the Israelis and none on            themselves. The most controversial clause in [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] is the call for            the &quot;withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied            in the recent conflict&quot;. The word &quot;all&quot; is probably the most contentious word in this resolution, because it isn't there, and the opposing sides are fiercely opposed on whether it was meant to be. In fact, the word &quot;all&quot; was purposefully omitted by the Soviet delegation. The Arab states failed to add it to the resolution, but even today they consider the word &quot;all&quot; to be implied. 

{{quote|It would have been wrong to demand that Israel         return to its positions of June 4, 1967, because those              positions were undesirable and artificial.&quot;|Lord Caradon}}

On October 15, 1968 the PLO stated to the UN General Assembly that it        rejected Resolution 242. Israel accepted the resolution on May 1, 1968.

==The captured territories==
{{quote|The situation between us is like the complex relationship between a Bedouin man and the young girl he has taken against her wishes. But when their children are born, they will see the man as their father and the woman as their mother. The initial act will mean nothing to them. You, the Palestinians, as a nation, do not want us today, but we will change your attitude by imposing our presence upon you.|Dayan, to Palestinian poet Fadwa Tukan&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p.478&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1948, there were no disputed territories under Israel's control, excepting the fact that the Arab states disputed the very existence of Israel. In 1956, though, the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula were captured from Egypt. During Israel's swift victory in the Six-Day War, two new territories were added: the West Bank, home to millions Arabs who had been expelled from Israel in the War of Independence, and the Golan Heights, a sparsely inhabited area but strategically important due to its water resources. Obviously, it was not ideal for Israel to be occupying a region full of people who remembered their expulsion from their homes quite well and still demanded the right to return. It was widely acknowledged that Israel's occupation of all four of these territories could become a potential source of future disputes and violence. After the war ended, Israel attempted to make a deal with Egypt and Jordan, returning the Gaza Strip and West Bank to their control in return for legal recognition and peace negotiations. The involved countries rejected this offer unilaterally in the [[w:Khartoum Resolution|Khartoum Resolution]].

Instead of annexing the West Bank a military administration was created. The Israeli authorities tried to reduce the impact on the population by preventing incidents that might encourage the Arabs to leave their homes. In 1972, elections were held in the West Bank. Women and nonlandowners were now permitted to vote unlike during Jordanian rule. The Israeli government required that the school texts in the territories be purged of anti-semitism or anti-Jewish language. Farmers, having produced a record crop in 1967, were permitted to sell their produce in Jordan, sparking an &quot;open bridges&quot; policy. As the year crept on, though, the West Bank's economy became tied to Israel's. In 1968 the customs stations were shut down and the lira became the official currency.

Economic assistance was provided, for example, that some of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were moved from camps to new homes. Many Palestinians had fresh water and electricity in their homes for the first time. This brought about protests from Egypt which had done nothing for the refugees when it controlled the area, but preferred to have the Palestinians suffer so that Israel could be blamed for the poor conditions.

Palestinians were also given freedom of movement: they could travel to and from Jordan. East Jerusalem Arabs were allowed to choose whether or not they would retain their Jordanian citizenship or acquire Israeli citizenship.

1971 President Anwar Sadat poised the proposition of signing an  agreement with Israel, so long as all of the occupied territories  captured by the Israelis were returned.

1972 At the Munich Summer Olympics, Palestinian terrorists  assasinated 11 Israeli athletes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/munich.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sadat stated that war was inevitable because there was no progress     towards peace; he claimed that he was prepared to sacrifice 1 million      soldiers in a war with Israel.

Sadat continued threatening war throughout 1972 - 1973 unless the          United States forced Israel to comply with his interpretation of the United Nations Resolution 242 {total withdrawl of Israeli forces  from territories gained during the 6-day war in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/un242.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While petition the US, Sadat built up a diplomatic offensive with         European and African states to aid his cause.

April 1973 during an interview, Sadat warned that he would renew        the war with Israel, but because of his previous threats pretty much        no one expected war.
===Israel begins to prepare for war===
On October 5, 1973 Israelis began preparing for the imminent war.. At 5:00am General David Elazar, the chief of staff, was the first      to recommend mobilization of forces and a preemptive air strike. This was overruled. A few hours passed and a partial call-up of the reserves was approved. Prime Minister, Golda Meir, still did not authorize Elazar to take        military action.  Meir advised the the US ambassador of the situation and asked that          he pass on the message that the Arabs should be restrained. US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, then appealed to Sadat and        the Syrian President Hafez Assad not to do anything rash. Kissinger also warned Meir not to shoot first.

Israel's chances for victory and having less casualties would be       better if Israel launched a preemptive strike along with the rapid       mobilization of the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), however, Meir feared       that by striking first, the US would be angered and Nixon might not       support Israel's policies or Israel during the war.&lt;ref&gt;       [http://www.adl.org/ISRAEL/Record/yomkippur.asp Source3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/1973toc.html Source4]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gochugaru''' (고추가루, also transliterated as '''go choo ga roo''') is red [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|chili pepper]], dried and ground into a coarse powder.  In preparing [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean]] dishes, just about any ground chili pepper may be used as a substitution, but be aware that several varieties of chili powder (such as [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]) can be quite a bit hotter or milder than gochugaru, and so it is advisable to add in small amounts until the desired level of spiciness is reached.</text>

== Definition ==
''bridi'' is the concept of sentences can be composed by the use of a predicate and several called ''arguments''. It coresponds to the linguistic concept of a clause.

A predicate together with its arguments (called ''sumti'') is a ''bridi''. A ''bridi'''s relations are expressed by a ''brivla''.

== Example ==

The statement '''mi prenu''' (I'm a person) is a ''bridi'' where '''x1 prenu''' is a ''brivla'' and '''mi''' is the ''sumti'' of the ''brivla''.

'''Foley''' sound is the technical term for the recreation of sound effects for a movie in a studio. Named after Jack Foley, the inventor of this technique,[http://atlantamusicgroup.com/foley1.html] it entails replacement and addition of sound in a film. Foley sound is created by an industry professional known as the foley-artist. Usually this is done in a recording studio known as a Foley Stage with the film being played back and interlocked to an audio recording device while the artist watches the picture and uses sometimes unusal articles and techniques to match picture.

Foley sounds may include as much as a: the dry ''smack'' of a punch, the ''revving'' engine of a car, or the ''crashing'' waves of the sea.

This is the traditional old-fashioned [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] [[w:Pie|pie]] with a gel-like filling. If you want a sticky filling, use this [[Cookbook:British Lemon Meringue Pie|recipe]]  instead.

==Ingredients==

===Pie filling===
*1½ (360ml) cups cold water
*1 cup (240g) white granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 tablespoons all purpose flour
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
*1/4 teaspoon salt
*1/2 cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] (from about 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]] or bottled lemon juice)
*1 tablespoon lemon [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] (from about 2 lemons)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*4 egg yolks, beaten
*1/8 teaspoon turmeric

===Meringue===
*4 egg whites
*¼ tsp cream of tartar
*6 tablespoons white granulated sugar


==Procedure==
===Pie Crust===
#Prepare [[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust|Grandma's Pie Crust]] or a ready-made refrigerated or frozen pie crust.

===Pie filling===
#In a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] together water, sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, turmeric, lemon juice and lemon zest. Make sure any flour or cornstarch lumps are stirred until they dissolve.
#Cook over medium heat until mixture starts to [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]]. Stir constantly.
#Add butter, stir until melted.
#Beat egg yolks in a small bowl. Add about ½ cup (120g) of hot lemon mixture into eggs and stir well. This tempers the egg yolks so they won't [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scramble]] when added to the simmering lemon mixture.
#Pour tempered egg mixture into pan of simmering lemon mixture. Stir until well mixed.
#Continue simmering lemon filling about 2 minutes until it thickens, stirring constantly.
#Pour into cooked pie shell and allow to cool while preparing meringue.

===Meringue===
#Place 4 egg whites in [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] and beat at high speed until they start to foam.
#Add cream of tartar to egg whites then, while continuing to beat, add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat about 30 seconds between tablespoonfuls of sugar.
#Continue to beat meringue until stiff peaks form when beaters are raised from bowl.
#Spread meringue over pie, starting on lemon pie filling, using rubber [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]]. Spread over edges of crust, completely sealing in the lemon pie filling.
#To form peaks in meringue, using a rubber spatula, touch flat side of spatula on meringue and pull away. Repeat over entire surface of meringue.
#Place pie in [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F]] (180°C) oven for 15 minutes until high points of meringue are lightly browned.
#Serve at room temperature or chilled.

==Warnings==
* The pie filling is quite hot when pouring it into pie shell. 
* Keep this pie refrigerated.
* In humid weather meringue may &quot;weep&quot; (small dots of liquid form on the surface). To lessen this possibility, apply meringue to lemon filling while it is still hot, cool pie to room temperature before refrigerating, and/or use confectioner's (powdered -- 4X or 10X) sugar instead of granulated sugar when making the meringue.

== Behavioral Decisions ==

Behavioral decision research is concerned with how people make judgments and choices, and with how the processes of decision might be improved. The field of behavioral decision research is intensely interdisciplinary, employing concepts and tools from psychology, economics, statistics, and other disciplines. 

Recently, experimental research on judgment and choice was said to be “psychology’s leading intellectual export to the social sciences as well as to a host of applied fields” (Tetlock, 2002, Psychological Review). 

Studies in the psychology of individual choice have identified numerous cognitive, informational, temporal, and other limitations which bound human rationality, often producing systematic errors and biases in judgment and choice. One of the greatest factors in forming any decision is a perception of the decision maker. Perception is a process by which individuals organize and interpret their sensory impressions in order to give meaning to their environment. People’s behavior is based on their perception of what reality is, not on reality itself i.e. the world as it is perceived is the world that is behaviorally important.

== Types ==

There are three types of factors that influence perception:
#Factors in the perceiver:
*Attitudes
*Motives
*Experiences
*Interests
*Expectations
#Factors in the situation: 
*Time
*Work setting
*Social Setting 
#Factors in the target:
*Novelty
*Motion
*Sounds
*Size
*Background
*Proximity
*Similarity

When individuals observe behavior, they attempt to determine whether it is internally or externally caused. This is the essence of attribution theory. When the individual behavior is observed there are three types of interpretation of this behavior, according to the attribution theory: (1) Distinctiveness: different behaviors in different situations; (2) Consensus: response is the same as others to same situation: (3) Consistency: response is the same over time.

== Errors ==

As is the case with most theories, errors and biases are possible in the attribution theory. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal factors when making judgments about the behavior of others. Self-serving bias is the tendency for individuals to attribute their own successes to internal factors while putting the blame for failures on external factors. 

== Perception and Decision ==

There is an obvious link between perception and decision. Decision is passed through a prism of individual decision-maker’s perception. This decision-making was (and still is) the subject of research of multiple disciplines. Few prominent decision-making models emerged.  One that has been described and used the most is the Rational Decision- Making Model, which describes how individuals should behave in order to maximize some outcome. Economists favor theories based on axioms of rational choice. Decision-making behavior is assumed to be rational and consistent. Agents maximize utility or profits, and the information required to do so is either freely available or optimally purchased. In the most extreme form, exemplified today by rational expectations models, agents have perfect models of the economy and never systematically err. However, in order for this model to work, it should be in conformance with numerous assumptions: 
*Problem is clear,
*Options are known, 
*Preferences are clear and constant, 
*No time or cost constraints are present, and
*Maximum payoff.

== Steps to a Decision ==

Steps in the rational decision-making model are: 
#Define the problem.
#Identify the decision criteria.
#Allocate weights to the criteria.
#Develop the alternatives.
#Evaluate the alternatives.
#Select the best alternative.

However, we can judge from our experiences that people are not always rational, nor that they behave in the rational manner. To support this observation psychologists have documented numerous experimental results of departures from optimal behavior in a wide variety of decision-making tasks. 

== Limitations ==

Rationality is bounded by limitations of information, time, and cognitive capability. This is what Herbert Simon referred to as bounded rationality. Individuals make decisions by constructing simplified models that extract the essential features from problems without capturing all their complexity. This bounded rationality influences how the decisions are made in the organizations. 

In a 1981 review Hogarth laments the &quot;insufficient attention&quot; paid &quot;to the effects of feedback between organism and environment.&quot; By feedback is meant not merely outcome feedback but changes in the environment, in the conditions of choice, which are caused, directly and indirectly, by a subject's past actions. For example, a firm's decision to increase production feeds back through the market to influence the price of goods, profits, and demand; greater output may tighten the markets for labor and materials; competitors may react - all influencing future production decisions. Such multiple feedbacks are the norm rather than the exception in real problems of choice. As a result it has been difficult for behavioral decision theory to make much headway in analyzing the dynamics of aggregate organizations such as a firm or industry.

== Types of People ==

Decision Theory does not in general provide a good description of people's decision behavior. Under some conditions Decision Theory may be approximately accurate: especially when experienced people are making consequential decisions (financial investors, lawyers negotiating a law suit settlement, etc.). But, even in these situations there are many violations of &quot;rationality.&quot; Compared to Decision Theory's predictions, people are:

Boundedly Rational
*they violate &quot;obviously rational&quot; axioms
*they cannot &quot;cognitively compute&quot; all the probability X payoff values

Boundedly Selfish
*they care about fairness
*they are altruistic 
*have Bounded Self-Control</text>

==Introduction==
This not a complete history of [[Wikipedia:Symbian|SymbianOS]] but in fact a summary of SymbianOS so that we as J2ME developers can determine what optional APIs we have access to by Operating System version and devices series version within the SymbianOS ecological infrastructure.

There are two main device platforms that are deployed on top of SymbianOS. [[Wikipedia:Nokia|Nokia]] created Series60 and licensed it to others like Samsung. [[Wikipedia:UIQ|UIQ(a Pen Based UI for Symbian)]] is a joint effort between Sony-Ericsson, Motorola and Symbian Ltd.

==Base Set of MIDP, SymbianOS==
A brief footnote before we begin on the J2ME Platform. Before the J2ME Platform SymbianOS came with two other Java platforms, embedded java on SymbianOS 5 and the personal java and javaphone combination on SymbianOS 6.  Thus, PersonalJava and JavaPhone before the Personal Profile will be mentioned here to be accurate of what OS versions have that combination. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Although the underlying OS does not limit Heap size, persistent storage, and etc on the later versions of Symbian the JSRs do limit the jar, jad, and persistent storage sizes in the form of JSR 185(JTWI).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

===SymbianOS 6.x===
In 2002 MIDP 1.0 was back ported to SymbianOS 6 versions. The SymbianOS versions that MIDP 1.0 was back ported to are SymbianOS 6.0 and SymbianOS 6.1({{Web reference|title=Standard Java|work=Symbian On Java|URL=http://www.symbian.com/technology/standard-java.html}})

Thus, we only have basic MIDP 1.0 on SymbianOS 6.0 and SymbianOS 6.1 on devices 2002 and onward.
*MIDP
**MIDP 1.0 except pausedApp is never called contrary to the MIDP 1.0 specification.
**CLDC 1.0
**Sun's KVM

*Personal Java(pre Personal Profile)
**Modified Personal Java 3.0.x(PesonalJava Application Environment 1.1.1a)
**JDVMI for debug support over TCP/IP connection
*JavaPhone 1.0
**JavaPhone 1.0 APIs
**Personal Java optional interfaces for serial communications, and secure socket communications (HTTPS is supported, javax.net.ssl is not implemented).
**Java Telephony API(JTAPI)
**Java Telephony Mobile

===SymbianOS 7.0===
Has the basic MIDP 1.0 implementation({{Web reference|title=SymbOS7.x|work=Symbian OS Version 7.0 functional description|URL=http://www.symbian.com/technology/symbos-v7x-det.html}})
*MIDP
**MIDP 1.0 except pausedApp is never called contrary to the MIDP 1.0 specification.
**CLDC 1.0

[[Image:Wheat in sack.jpg|right|thumb|Wheat in a sack]]

'''Wheat''' is a grain which is the basis of many different kinds of food. Ground into [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] it is the basis for most of the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] and [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] eaten in the world. The whole grains can be boiled and used like rice. With some processing, wheat is converted into [[Cookbook:Couscous|couscous]] and [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulgur wheat]], which both are easier to cook and used like rice.

Wheat berries (unprocessed seed) are also grown to make [[Cookbook:Wheat grass juice|wheat grass juice]].

[[Image:Zest Grater.jpg|thumb|right|A zest grater]]

'''Zest''' is the coloured outer surface of [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]; zesting is the act of scraping the zest from the fruit. A [[Cookbook:Zester|zester]] is ideal for the task. Some people use a [[Cookbook:Knife|serrated knife]] instead. Alternatively, the careful application of a fine-toothed [[Cookbook:Grater|grater]] works well (pictured is a grater specifically designed for zesting). Dried zest is sometimes sold alongside [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]].

Dried '''bonito flakes''', known as ''katsuo-bushi'' or ''katsuobushi'' in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]], are flakes of dried, smoked bonito [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]. They look similar to wood shavings. The &quot;bonito&quot; is a type of [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], but may not be marketed as tuna in many countries.

Bonito flakes are used to make ''katsuobushi-dashi'', the second most favored type of [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] (Japanese [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]) for [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]]. Bonito flakes are also used for [[Cookbook:Onigiri|onigiri]] filling and to make ponzu sauce.

{{wikipedia|Katsuobushi}}

Bonito flakes are also marketed as cat treats in the United States, primarily in specialty pet stores.</text>

The kernel started as very old BSD. The MACH microkernel disaster was added, taking over memory management and task handling among other things. This was the NeXT kernel. Then lots of NetBSD code was added to modernize things a bit.

Userspace took a similar path, but being modernized mostly with FreeBSD and GNU code.

'''Lardons''' are bits of [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] that can be injected into a tough piece of meat prior to cooking. The injection of lardons is called larding.

In French cuisine, lardons are blocks of bacon, cut in a cuboid shape, about 3 to 4 cm long and a little less that 1 cm wide on the other 2 sides.

Any feedback on the recipe?
:yeah, sucks
::Please explain in which way this recipe sucks so I can clarify parts of, or ammend, the recipe to help others.

:This is a very odd recipe!  You can't seriously mean 1 cup of weed, that's a ridiculous amount.  This is more like a very odd sort of... scone recipe.  The recipe can't be right with water in it, and no eggs or at least milk.  It can't rise at all... I really suggest just your classic victoria-spongey style recipe with say an 8th of weed in it.  A cup of weed?  No way, how much would that cost!!!?  Admittedly I haven't made this recipe, but just looking at it firstly saying a cup of weed from the fact it has loads of water in and no eggs, it's just clearly wrong.  Baking at 300 degrees is also crazy- 220 at most for almost any sort of baking.

Ive been making cakes every weekend for the last couple of months, for 8 cakes I use 3.5g of weed, 3g in the mix and then the rest mixed into the sauce for the top, but that other guy is right, if you go over 200*c it burns, fast.  I had it on 250*c and within 10mins it was burnt to funk

::Also agree. A cup of weed, roughly speaking and obviously depending on quality, would cost upwards of $200. That is an insane amount, and no more then 3.5g should be used bottom line.

==Suggestions==
Any suggestions for things to add?


This recipe works a dream just dont use a cup of mahjurana use around an eighth and make the recipe to your own calculatons weighed by eye and it turns out fine!!!!!!!!!!!

== Warning ==

Should that warning and disclaimer be added to the Rum Balls?

==Feedback==

Please add any observations you have had with this recipe to the discussion page, as well as any ideas or different methods you have attempted. I would also like to convert this recipe to organic and wheat-free versions, so if anyone has the proportions one would need to adjust for the different ingredients, please edit this article and add them accordingly or put them in the diuscussion page and someone else can format them in properly.

&lt;b&gt;Feedback From A_o_D&lt;/b&gt;

So, i cooked this 'space cake' and it was great!:)

I fixed up this article. I deleted errors, and gave a good explanation. 

The biggest error that was in the text was that:
1. the dots are not usually used to read or write Arabic
The truth is they are always used nowadays. Just open a book, and you will see the dots. They were not in the pre-islamic era, and during the Early islamic era.

THOSE Dots do not indicate vowels. They differentiate one constanant from others that are written with the same shape.

I believe that the person who wrote the article is confusing the dots with the signs used to indicate vowels. The signs used to indicate vowels are loops, and lines, there is a sign for the lack of a vowel, and there is also a sign for the gemination of a constanant. These symbols are the ones viewed as mostly superfluos to anyone fluent in reading arabic.

--------
I just wanted to clean up the text a little bit. The general message was there, although not readily understood.

Feel free to improve on this all you want.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.6x}}

The render settings control various options related to the output of rendered, or full quality images. Rendering an image will calculate effects not displayed in the editing environment (due to their complexity), and therefore takes a larger amount of time to produce an image. If you notice an error partway through a render, then you can press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}} to abort the render.

==The Render Settings==

Let's take a look at all of the rendering options that Blender has.  Open up a new scene ('''CTRL + N''') and click on the camera icon in the Properties window to get to the rendering context. You should see something that looks like the image on the left.[[Image: Render Settings.png|left|The default render settings.]]

These are the default settings for Blender Internal.  Let's take a look at all of these settings and see what they do.

==Render Layers and Render Passes==

[[Image:Render_Layers_tab.png|thumb|230px|right|Render Layers]]
Render layers are a way of organising data so that you can edit the render selectively after it's finished. This requires different objects to be on different scene layers, and each scene layer usually has its own render layer (though this is arbitrary).

Render passes are different types of data that make up an image, separated and put into its own 'pass' that you can use to change the render selectively. This is extremely common when using Blender's compositor to do post-processing.

For example, let's say that you want to composite a 3D object from Blender into a video that you shot. In order to make the shadows from the render affect the footage, you would enable ambient occlusion and select the 'AO' pass as shown in the image on the right. You then would have an AO pass in addition to the combined render. You could then multiply the AO pass over the footage in the compositor in order to make shadows from Blender appear in your footage.
If you had separated your image into different color passes then you could edit each color pass to make the colors match the footage.

Of course, you could also use the render passes/layers to make post-processing easier in completely digital scenes. e.g. use the Index Object pass to make a glare effect on a particular object. The index object pass creates a greyscale mask for an object that you can plug into the 'Factor' input of the glare node, this makes the glare effect occur only for that object.


{{clear}}

==Dimensions and Anti-aliasing==
[[Image:Dimensions_and_antiAliasing.png|thumb|281px|left|Dimensions &amp; Anti-aliasing]]

As you can see in the image on the left, below the render layer settings we have the dimensions and anti-aliasing settings.

The dimension settings are pretty simple: the X slider defines the width (in pixels) of your render, the Y slider defines the height (also in pixels) of your render. Above the X/Y sliders is a menu with some handy presets for commonly used resolutions, such as 1080p, 720p, and different TV resolutions. Below the X/Y sliders is another slider showing a percentage, the percentage indicates what size the render will be compared to the X/Y values. In the screenshot the slider is at 50%, so the scene will be rendered at half the size of the full resolution (in this case half the size of 1080p). This is a very easy way to quickly change the size of your render without worrying about numbers.

==Render==

[[Image:Render tab.png|thumb|280px|right|Render tab]]

Now, let's move on to the render tab!  The first thing you should notice is the VERY BIG button that says 'Render' on it.  This button performs the same action as the '''F12''' button.  Below this is a drop-down box, allowing you to change between the Blender Internal Render engine and YAFRAY.  (For more on YAFRAY, see [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Yafray Render Options|YAFRAY Render Options]]).  Next to the 'Render' button are 5 buttons: Shadow, Env Map, Pano, Ray, Radio.  These are explained in detail below:
*Shadow:  Lights will cast shadows.  If this is turned off, nothing will cast a shadow.  To see this, add a plane below your default cube and render.  Now turn this button off and see how there are no shadows.
*EnvMap: Use the environment map. 
*Pano: This enables panoramic rendering.  For more on panoramic rendering, see [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Looking_All_Around_-_Panorama_Settings|Panorama Settings]]
*Ray: This enables Ray Tracing. Turn it off, and render the same images as I talked about in the description of the Shadow button.  &quot;What!?&quot;  you say.  &quot;That did the same thing as turning off the shadows!  What's the deal?&quot;  Well, ray tracing is used to calculate how light goes through objects like glass and stuff. It also has something to do with shadows.
*Radio: This stands for Radiosity.  

Moving on, the next button we come to is the 'OSA' button.  For the use of this button, see [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/OSA|OSA]]

To the right of the OSA button, are some percentages.  These will set the renderer to render at the specified percent of the resolution that you have set.  (We'll come to resolution later)  For an experiment, press the '50%' button.  As you can see, Blender renders the image at 50% of the set resolution.  This is an easy way to make a quick render.

Next on our tour, we come to two boxes labeled 'Xparts' and 'Yparts'.  These buttons change the number of boxes that Blender will render in total.  Play around with these to see how they change the number of small boxes in the render window when you render.

==Anim / Bake==
[[Image:Anim_tab.png|thumb|278px|right|Anim tab]]

[[Image:Bake_tab.png|thumb|283px|left|Bake tab]]

The final tab we'll (briefly) cover is the Anim(Animation) tab.  If you have made an animation, pressing the 'ANIM' button will render your  animation. Right below it are two buttons, Do Sequence and Do Composite. The Do Sequence button will render your animation with any effects you have done in the Sequence Editor and the Do Composite button will render an animation with your composite node work included.
The Sta: and End: are the start and end frame numbers. The default setting is that your animation will start at frame 1, and will end at frame 250.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vosotros is the informal way to address a group including the person you are talking to. In English, we do this in various ways: y´all, you guys, all you, you all, yous guys, etc - depending on the region from which we originate. Vosotros is similar; with usage varying geographically as with the English expressions. This verb form is generally only used in Spain, and using it anywhere else (Latin America, the Caribbean, and Mexico, for example) will attract some very funny looks. It is usually used in a very informal way to address a group of people and implies that not one of the persons in the group would deserve an ''Usted'' title in singular conversation. In all situations where ''vosotros'' is not appropriate, you would use ''ustedes'' to address more than one person.

However, ''vosotros'' is also used in some more formal written forms on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, Biblical passages typically use ''vosotros'' forms when the speaker is addressing multiple people. You will regularly see and hear ''vosotros'' in Biblical quotes wherever you are. Therefore, you may want to at least recognize the usage even if you don't know how to use it yourself.

      <comment>/* The plural definite */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Like English nouns, the Swedish nouns are declined according to number: they're either singular or plural. Unlike English, however, Swedish nouns are also declined according to article (&quot;the car&quot; versus &quot;a car&quot;). Instead of a definite article - &quot;the&quot; in the case of English - Swedish uses suffixes. We will see how this works later on.

==Gender==

The North Germanic languages, to which Swedish belongs, originally had three genders: masculine (''maskulinum''), feminine (''femininum'') and neuter (''neutrum''). However, as the language evolved, the first two were merged into a &quot;real gender&quot; (''realgenus'') or common (''utrum''). In practice, this means Swedish has what we might call two flavours of &quot;it&quot;, which can complicate matters. 


===Common - gender neutral===
*en stol - a chair
*stolen - the chair
*en ny stol - a new chair
*den nya stolen - the new chair
*stolar - chairs
*stolarna - the chairs
*nya stolar - new chairs
*de nya stolarna - the new chairs

===Neuter===
*ett bord - a table
*bordet - the table
*ett nytt bord - a new table
*det nya bordet - the new table
*två bord - two tables
*borden - the tables
*nya bord - new tables
*de nya borden - the new tables


The gender of a noun does not only affect the noun itself but also adjectives describing the noun, definite articles and singular indefinite articles. 

As a rule, the gender of a noun cannot be figured out just by looking at spelling. 

There are two generalizations that might be helpful to know:
almost all nouns that end with an &quot;-a&quot; belong to the common gender, and most words that remain unchanged in the plural form (for example: &quot;a tire, several tires&quot; becomes &quot;ett däck, flera däck&quot;) are neuter nouns;
the only clear &quot;-a&quot;-ending exceptions to the common form are the words &quot;ett öga&quot; (&quot;an eye&quot;), &quot;ett öra&quot; (&quot;an ear&quot;) and &quot;ett hjärta&quot; (&quot;a heart&quot;).

==Definiteness==

A ''definite'' noun in English takes the ''definite'' article ''the'', and an ''indefinite'' noun takes the ''indefinite'' articles ''a'' or ''an''.  As far as indefinite nouns are concerned, things are very similar in Swedish.

The indefinite articles are ''en'' and ''ett''.  A neuter noun takes ''ett'' and a common noun takes ''en''.
*ett bord - a table
*en stol - a chair

The definite articles in Swedish are attached to the ''end'' of the noun as a ''suffix''.  The neuter suffix is ''-et'' and the common suffix is ''-en''.
*bordet - the table
*stolen - the chair

In addition to these two suffixes, Swedish also has two further definite articles which are much more similar to English ''the''.  The articles are used when you want to use an ''adjective'' (a word which ''describes'' a noun like green, big, old, etc) with the definite noun.  The common article is ''den'' and the neuter is ''det''.

*det nya bordet - the new table
*den nya stolen - the new chair

Notice that the nouns still have the definite suffix attached, which might appear slightly awkward in English. For example, the example ''det nya bordet'' mentioned above literally translates as ''The new the table'', which is nonsencial in English but fully correct in Swedish. Note that some fixed expresssions tend to drop the first ''the'', as for example ''svenska folket'' (the Swedish people). Adjectives decline for number and gender, but that will be looked at in greater detail elsewhere.

==Number==

Swedish boasts no less than six different pluralization suffixes, two of which are used in both genders. In the common gender, it's often hard to know which one to use together with a certain noun. The -s plural suffix is never used in Swedish.

Though it is important to remember that there are always exceptions, and there are words with complete irregularity, like &quot;gås&quot; (goose) and &quot;gäss&quot; (geese).

'''Common:'''
===-er===
* bild &gt; bilder (picture &gt; pictures)

===-ar===
* båt &gt; båtar (boat &gt; boats)
* stege &gt; stegar (ladder &gt; ladders)

===-or===
* flicka &gt; flickor (girl &gt; girls)
[only used with words ending in -''a'']
===-r===
* sko &gt; skor (shoe &gt; shoes)

===-0 (no suffix) ===
* bagare &gt; bagare (baker &gt; bakers)
[only used with titles, occupations etc. ending in unstressed ''-are'']

'''Neuter:'''
===-0 (no suffix)=== 
* hus &gt; hus (house &gt; houses)

===-n===
* äpple &gt; äpplen (apple &gt; apples)

===-er===
* bageri &gt; bagerier (bakery &gt; bakeries)
[only used with words ending in stressed -''eri'']

==The plural definite==
In Swedish the plural definite articles are ''-en'' for neuter gender and ''-na'' for common gender. 

* borden - the tables
* stolarna - the chairs
* husen - the houses

As you can see, ''-en'' was also used as one of the definite articles for common gender. This can produce confusion as a person might want to say ''the table'' and think that he should use the ''-en'' as definite article: ''borden''. That would however lead to saying ''the tables''.

'''Superfine sugar''' is also known as '''bar sugar''' (so-named for use in mixing alcoholic drinks) or '''baking sugar'''. It is [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]] with unusually small crystals. Sold as [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar or castor sugar]], this is the standard type of sugar in some parts of the world.

Superfine sugar crystals are easy to disolve in cold liquids.  This property also causes doughs, [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringues]] and batters made with superfine sugar to be of a finer texture than is usually achieved with granulated sugar.

Superfine sugar is ''not'' the same as [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar, confectioners' sugar, and icing sugar]]. A [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] can be used (abused) to create a decent approximation of superfine sugar from granulated sugar. Depending on the recipe, it may be acceptable to simply substitute either granulated sugar or powdered sugar.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to the Knowledge Management Wiki Page==

This Wiki Page provides an overview of the basic concepts of Knowledge Managemment (KM).&lt;br&gt;
The history, people and specific technology of KM are '''not''' covered here.&lt;br&gt;
Sections on the different types of KM systems do '''not''' necessarily appear in historical order.


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Basic Concepts of Knowledge Management (KM) ==

===What is the goal of KM?===

The goal of KM is to make knowledge accessible for rapid response to emerging situations. A practical KM system therefore enables workers to efficiently reuse the knowledge of an organization rather than to waste time recreating redundant knowledge.

===What is the cycle of KM?===

'''Collection'''&lt;br&gt;

KM people and systems should capture new knowledge as it is generated by an organisation. 

The KM system must therefore provide a convenient format for reporting new knowledge.

'''Organization'''&lt;br&gt;

KM systems provide a structure for organization that facilitates both storage and retrieval of new knowledge. 

Organization of knowledge supports the main goal of KM which is provide easy access to knowledge for reuse.

'''Refinement'''&lt;br&gt;

KM knowledge bases must be uncluttered. 

Obsolete knowledge must be removed; redundant examples must be removed; errors must be corrected. Systematic maintenance takes planning and the allocation of time.

===What defines the term &quot;knowledge&quot; within KM?===

KM is a system for managing knowledge within specific organizations. KM therefore covers '''proprietary''' processes, procedures, histories and the lessons learned during the operation of a given organization. The knowledge bases managed by KM systems are therefore finite and focused, as opposed to the general knowledge bases stored in library systems and the universe of information and misinformation that is published on the World Wide Web. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Www www].&lt;br&gt;

===Where does organizational knowledge come from?===

'''Creative Activities'''&lt;br&gt;
Organizations generate new knowledge through activity. Organizations create designs, processes, procedures, and reports in order to improve operations, serve clients, and conform to regulations.


'''Problem Solving Activities'''&lt;br&gt;
All organizations must solve problems. The list includes legal problems, production problems, labor problems, and customer problems. Problem solving activities generate reusable knowledge such as problem-prevention knowledge and problem-solving strategies.

'''Reuse of Existing Knowledge'''&lt;br&gt;
The '''reuse''' of existing knowledge also generates new knowledge. Old case studies can be reused to generate new solutions; old trends can be analyzed to generate new forecasting tools. New knowledge often descends from established knowledge.

===Intranets as Knowledge Management Systems===

'''Intranets - by Natural Progression'''&lt;br&gt;
When companies began to develop their intranets, it began as an Internet-based private-secure networked environment where divisions, departments and employees could store, retrieve, publish, and share information.  As time when on the intranet began to build its repository of information and thus it started becoming a valuable repository of knowledge.  Once search engine capabilities were added to the intranet, accessibility to the information and knowledge became more structured and easy to locate, sort and retrieve.  Therefore, by natural progression, Intranet sites are becoming knowledge management systems.  For more information, read the article by Steven L. Telleen, Ph.D. [[http://www.iorg.com/papers/knowledge.html Intranets as Knowledge Management Systems]]


===Why is KM needed?===

Effective Knowledge Management ensure that the right information is available to the right person at the right time.

'''Workforce Turnover'''&lt;br&gt;
When employees leave an organization they take valuable knowledge with them.

'''Limitations of Human Memory'''&lt;br&gt;
Employees rapidly move from project to project. The details of past activities are often forgotten. Also, human memory can be self-corrupting, because people will unconsciously alter their knowledge to make things logical or acceptable within their own contexts.

'''Poor Communications'''&lt;br&gt;
Corporate microsystems can be competitive and self-insulating. One brand-management team may create an effective marketing strategy, and then neglect to share that new strategy with another brand-management team in the same organization.


===How is a KM professional’s definition of KM substantively different than a typical dictionary definition of that word?===

The Webster's New Millennium™ Dictionary of English (2005) defines knowledge management (KM) as the technologies involved in creating, disseminating, and utilizing knowledge data. Tiwana (2002) states “KM enables the creation, distribution, and exploitation of knowledge to create and retain greater value from core business competencies.&quot; The substantive difference between these definitions is the dictionary definition does not focus on the outcome of KM. That is, to retain value from business knowledge.  The value can be the benefit of using knowledge to adjust to change or using knowledge to avoid making the same mistakes again.

===What is epistemology, and why is that subject mentioned in relation to KM?===

The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language (2000) defines epistemology as the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and validity.  Epistemology is mentioned in relation to knowledge management (KM) because KM deals with the management of knowledge.  Thus it is imperative to understand the nature of knowledge in order to manage it.  In addition epistemology deals with validity or strength of knowledge.  Thus epistemology can assist KM practitioners in categorizing knowledge on a scale of weak to strong.  Thus a KM practitioner can use ideas from the study of knowledge to better manage knowledge in an organization. 
 
===What is “innovative nonexploiters”?===

Innovative nonexploiters are companies or organizations that have innovations or are innovators but do not exploit or take advantage of their innovations.  Example of innovative nonexploiters would be companies that have innovation but are weak exploiter of their own innovation or knowledge.  The outcome of being an innovative nonexploiter could be negative, to the company, if external forces take advantage of the knowledge or innovation and capitalize on it.   Tiwana (2002) cites XEROX as an example of an innovative nonexploiter citing their PARC innovation as the foundation of the computer industry that XEROX did not take advantage of.   

===What is “intellectual capital”? Give some examples.===

Intellectual capital is intangible or “vague” assets that may not be measurable, but are invaluable to an organization (Tiwana, 2002).  In a business setting intellectual capital can be a companies competitive edge over other companies.  Examples of intellectual capital could be reputation, human knowledge, patents, strong leadership, or name recognition. In general if something adds value to a company, but it cannot be logged in the accounting ledgers that it is most likely intellectual capital.

===What skills do instructional technologists bring to knowledge management projects?===

Instructional technologists bring various skills to knowledge management projects. Included in these skills are identifying subject matter experts, designing instruction to enhance the knowledge base of an organization, determine appropriate methods to cross-train employees to share (verses hoard) knowledge, using the design process to transfer tacit knowledge to written or implicit knowledge.  Using models (ADDIE) to develop systematic method methods to use an organizations knowledge base to enhance an organization. Enhance the learning environment of an organization by defining learning characteristics and styles of the human resources in the organization.

===What problems are there with knowledge?===

Cost of obtaining knowledge or keeping knowledge from getting out can be very costly.  For instance to hire or train an employee with knowledge on how to fix O-rings on the space shuttle can have a very high price tag. 

In terms of interpretation knowledge can be interpreted differently, and the interpretation can have serious implications.  For example knowledge of weapons of mass destructions in Iraq were interpreted as a threat to civilization by the Bush administration.  This lead to serious consequences that are currently being debated by the public at all levels.

Hoarding poses a problem because knowledge can be hoarded.  Hoarding in itself is not a good thing.  Some persons hoard knowledge for financial gain.  Some persons hoard knowledge to be devious. An example of hoarding knowledge may be a person keeping knowledge from a judge or jury to sway the outcome of a court case.

Culture/language can also be a problem with knowledge.  This can also be linked to translation.  Translating knowledge can be very difficult and costly. For example translating knowledge written on the ancient pyramids in Egypt was a costly and time-consuming process.             
 

===What are the potential risks associated with not integrating KM into an organization’s operation?===

KM helps avoid unnecessary work duplication, expensive reinvestment, and repeated mistakes (Tiwana, 2002).

KM can save an organization from “knowledge walkouts” (2002). Meaning that persons with specific knowledge that is important for on organizations survival can leave without sharing that knowledge with others.  

KM can make an organization a proactive anticipator (2002).  Thus by implementing KM an organization can anticipate changes and use knowledge to anticipate change that without KM can hit an organization hard.

KM mutually reinforces an organization agility or dexterity (2002).  An organizations ability to react comes from their knowledge and the agility comes from the ability to apply the knowledge (2002). 


===Where would a KM professional argue that knowledge resides?===

Tiwana (2002) suggests that knowledge “originates in individual minds, but is often embedded in organizational routines, processes, practices, systems, software, and norms.” Behaviorism, which is a traditional educational conception, defines learning as a relatively permanent change in behavior that may or may not be the result of instruction (Morrison, Ross, &amp; Kemp 2004). Thus in terms of a traditional educational conception of learning, one could suggest that there is not a tension between KM professional concept of knowledge and an educational concept.  That is, KM professional agree that knowledge resides in an individuals mind and is passed along within the organization through routines or processes.  A behaviorist believes that learning is a change in behavior.  Thus for changes in the routine or process to occur learning as to occur, that is a change in behavior will result in the change of routines or process.  Therefore, both the KM professional and the behaviorist believe that learning and knowledge begin with an individual and are passed along through changes in behavior and the organization, respectively.

== Course Management Systems  ==

===What is a Course Management System===

(CMS) are specific types of KM systems often used in academic settings.&lt;br&gt;
Examples of software applications for creating a CMS include Blackboard and Web CT.&lt;br&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_management_system Course Management Systems]&lt;br&gt;

===Advantages of CMS===
:*Reasonably user friendly.
:*Support student collaboration and dialogue.
:*Support links to documents, images and other web sites.
:*Provide a student roster with email capabilities.
:*Facilitate real-time &quot;classroom&quot; discussions.
:*Facilitate on-line testing of students.

===Limitations of CMS===
:*Does '''not''' support reusable learning objects (RLO).
:*Does '''not''' support collection of statistical information.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Learning Management Systems ==

===What is a Learning Management System===

Learning Management Systems (LMS)are a specific type of KM system often used in business settings.&lt;br&gt;
Examples of software applications for creating a CM include Gen21 and Moodle.&lt;br&gt;
(Moodle is an open-source application.)&lt;br&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system Learning Management Systems]

===Advantages of LMS===

:* Support links to documents, images and other web sites.
:* Facilitate on-line testing of students.
:* Facilitate collection of test performance for statistical analysis.
:* Support SCO and SCORM architectures.

===Limitations of LMS===

:* LMS applications are moderately complex and require more learning than CMS applications.&lt;br&gt;

'''A:''' Guess. EPSS provides specific instructions for well defined tasks. KM per se is a catagory that includes several broader knowledge bases. &lt;br&gt;
Perhaps the differences in purpose generated the need for different names.&lt;br&gt;

==War Throughout History==
From failure to success and somewhere in-between, this section views war from the perspective of reality rather than theory.

''&quot;History is written by the winners.&quot;''

''&quot;History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.&quot;'' -Attributed to Winston Churchill

''&quot;Those who will not remember history, are condemned to repeat it.&quot;'' -Santayanna.

''&quot;Walk softly, but carry a big stick.&quot;'' -Theodore Roosevelt.

It is hoped by many that one day we will have peace and unity throughout the world. Until that day arrives, people who are free or wishing to be free must be prepared to fight to maintain or obtain their freedom. Freedom is a temporary result of successful Warfare (and lots of politicking... but that's another book). Successful Warfare begins in the mind. To that end, the following section attempts to establish a mental framework in which the necessity of Successful Warfare is understandable.

A people may choose to avoid offensive actions. If they care to survive, they cannot avoid preparation for defensive actions. In the past invasions aimed to wipe out the original inhabitants.

After an early history of militancy, the Roman peoples became addicted to the opulence (or at least the free bread and circuses) that their empire had gained for them. Wearying of fighting their own wars, they attempted to defend their borders with hired help. Where is the Roman Empire today?

Iceland was sparsely inhabited by Irish monks before and when the Norse arrived. Iceland today has one of the most homogeneous (Scandinavian) gene-pools of any nation on earth. 

The Tibetans were one of China's scourges for centuries, descending from the Tibetan plateau to raid and pillage the Chinese. The Chinese solved the problem by sending in Buddhist monks espousing the peaceful philosophy of the Buddha. The Tibetans converted en masse. Who's laughing now?

''Freedom is not free.''

''If you can read this, thank a Teacher. If you can read this in English, thank a Veteran.'' -[anonymous Americana]

==Evolution of War==
This section details the evolution of warfare and fighting throughout the history of man.

'''Display vs. Proof.'''

Fighting requires resources. Expenditure of these resources produces a weakened state, more susceptible to losing the next confrontation. '''Displays''' and '''Intimidation''' have always been and will always be preferable to actual fighting. This is seen from the lowest orders of animals to the May-Day Parades of the Soviets (and at all stations in between). This is an unalterable axiom of warfare.

Display ''rather than'' Proof, however, allows for bluffing and deception.

'''Safety in numbers: more is better (usually).'''

In the beginning, there was the Alpha-male. The Alpha-male is, by definition, capable of defeating each an every other individual in &quot;the group&quot; in one-on-one fighting. 

Somewhat later, although still in the mists of time, it was discovered that two or more weaker individuals could combine their strengths to overcome an onerous alpha-male. It is also true, however, that allies ''usually'' fall to bickering among themselves once the obvious danger of the (former) Alpha-male has been removed. &quot;There can be only one&quot; is a truism of most primitive situations, and is the basis of the Executive branch of government in modern representative democracies (committees are a perfect way to prevent anything from actually being accomplished). Nonetheless, the concepts and utility of '''combined forces''' and '''collective security''' have been with us ever since. Bigger armies defeat smaller armies with alarming regularity. With a few hiccups (induced by the occasional downfall of society and subsequent dark ages), societal groupings (tribes/states) and their fighting branches (warrior-bands/armies) have tended to increase in size.

'''Speed vs. Armour'''

Basic fighting may be defined as delivering kinetic energy to ones adversary in ways least conducive to their continued functioning, while attempting to avoid their reciprocal offerings. 

The two primary ways of avoiding the receipt of kinetic energy are '''Speed''' (being fast enough to get out of the way) and '''Armour''' (shielding, to absorb the blow via the law of Conservation of Momentum). The requirements for Speed vs. Armour are mutually conflicting. The more armour you carry, the slower you can move... the faster you move, the less armour you can carry.

In the evolution of warfare, the pendulum has swung back and forth many times between the requirements for speed vs. armour. Usually it is some tactical or technical innovation which provides the impetus for reversing the swing. 

Greek Hoplites in phalanx formations were very heavily armoured for their day, yet they were undone by the administrative superiority of more lightly armoured Roman Legions. 

The introduction of the stirrup to Europe in the 5th century AD allowed what had been lightly armoured cavalry lancers to develop into the Knights in Armour of the mediaeval era. The extra stability of stirrups and larger horses allowing, for a time, high speed ''and'' heavy armour; the entire ensemble of man, horse, armour and arms being the delivery device for the kinetic energy. The high infrastructure requirements for supporting this fighting  style eventually helped to develop one of the highest levels of armouring seen: stone castles -- absolutely zero speed and manoeuvrability, combined with as much shielding as one could quarry, all in an attempt to defend the specific piece of land which allowed sustaining the fighting horses and men.

These circumstances, however, were wholly undone by the introduction of gun-powder and firearms beginning in the 14th century AD. Firearms induced a reversion to little or no armour. The available armouring technologies were incapable of  stopping bullets; and with the slow rate of fire and high rate of misfires, once a soldier had fired his shot, speed was of the utmost importance to complete ones bayonet charge before the enemy could reload.

Automatic weapons and machine guns reversed the pendulum yet again. Speed for charging meant little before the heavy sustained fire of the 20th century. Helmets, so noticeably absent from 18th and 19th century battlefields made a great comeback. It was the extreme heavy armour of tanks that broke the trench-warfare stalemate of WWI.

War planes, and fighter planes, rockets, and missiles... speed, speed, and more speed.

Nuclear weapons, however brought the state of the art back to ever larger bunkers, perhaps culminating in artifacts such as Cheyenne Mountain.

'''Guerilla Warfare'''

Guerrilla Warfare is a redundant misnomer, as &quot;Guerilla&quot; is Spanish for &quot;little war&quot;. But we seem to be stuck with the term in English, at least.

Guerilla Warfare takes maximum advantage of speed, and seems to have little use for armour. Furthermore, it would seem to defy the rule of &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot;, as most operations are conducted by small highly-mobile groups. During a guerilla attack, soldiers attack the enemy quickly, then &quot;vanish&quot; into the landscape.

To be maximally effective, however, an insurgency must be well entrenched, which is to say, they should have the support of the populous among which they operate. Thus, although they may have very few actual operatives, the collusion of the local ''non-combatants'' swells the effective number of real participants far beyond the number of soldiers their adversary may be able to field. Furthermore, the surrounding populous provides maximum opportunity for '''Cover and Concealment''' both before and after any particular strike.

'''Total War'''

Total War is the practice of considering all of an enemy's resources as valid targets; to include civilian population, and means of production (agricultural and industrial). 

The earliest record of Total War tactics is the Trojan War,where a Mycynean army of 100.000 defeated the Trojans and their allies,destroyed and looted their city and killed or enslaved almost every inhabitant. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, there were no industrial means of production, aside from perhaps mining, smelting, and the activities of smiths (armourers). Agricultural means of production (farms and farmers) were more often siezed to augment the invader's supplies than destroyed, or rather destroyed by their defender to deny them to the invader (Scorched Earth Policy). Civilian populations, however, have always suffered during war, whether because they were taken to be sold into slavery, because their food was taken or destroyed, because their homes were occupied or destroyed, or due to the pestilence which always accompanies warfare.

During the high middle-ages in Europe, the code of Chivalry supposedly forbade the mistreatment of non-combatants. It is not at all clear that the civilians would agree that this was actually the case.

And for an all too brief period around the 18th century, War was considered a Gentlemen's' Sport: supposedly not making more of a mess than could be cleaned up by tea-time. This is more likely a Victorian romanticisation, all the more plausible the further you were in time and space from the battle field.

WWI and to a greater degree WWII were text-book examples of Total War; with indiscriminate use of Chemical Weapons and bombing (conventional and nuclear) of industrial/population centres to destroy enemy resources and morale.

'''Law of War'''

In conjunction with the increased use of Total War, the '''Geneva Conventions''' have been an attempt by the larger players in geo-politics to provide a framework for minimizing the inherent suffering of war. In particular, guidelines have been laid down concerning the &quot;fair&quot; treatment of medical facilities and personnel, clergy/chaplains, the wounded, and prisoners of war. 

The International Red Cross (and sister organizations such as the Red Crescent, et al.) are the bodies responsible for implementing many of the humanitarian assistances prescribed under the various Geneva Conventions.

The International Court at The Hague is the responsible body for trying and prosecuting parties suspected of breaching the guidelines laid out in the Geneva Conventions. [vide War Crimes and War Criminals]

Various treaties have been attempted to eliminate or reduce the threat from Chemical, Biological, and Nuclear weapons of mass destruction. None of these have been nearly as comprehensive as the Geneva Conventions. The United States, for instance, reserves the right of 1st strike with Nuclear Weapons, the right to retaliate with Chemical Weapons (2nd strike), and will not use Biological Weapons (no strike). 

It is extremely important to note, that the Geneva Conventions and these other treaties are all agreements between the governments of states/nations. Supranational terrorist groups are NOT parties to these agreements, and indeed, their most basic tactics fly in the very face of these agreements. It is left as an exercise for the reader as to whether or not these individuals should be accorded the rights guaranteed under these agreements.

'''Religious and Ideological Wars'''

Aside from merely wishing to conquer another group, and take what is theirs, Religious and Ideological Wars have been an attempt by one party to violently control the way another group thinks, or to subjugate or at least harm them because of what they think.

A non-exhaustive list of examples of this behaviour include the spread of Islam (7th century onward -- the creation of the Caliphate), various civil wars of the Byzantine Empire, the Crusades (12th through 14th centuries), the Wars of the Reformation, the spread and containment of Communism (the Cold War)(20th century), and the more recent disagreement between Islamic fundamentalist terrorists and the Western Nations.

==Levels of Military Thinking==

===Strategy===

If you're only thinking about military matters, you're not thinking about strategy. Strategy encompasses all the tools at a nation's disposal: military, diplomatic, economic and social. Military force is but one tool in a nation's toolbox.

Strategy is defining a nation's needs and objectives, and then devising a plan for meeting those needs and objectives. For example, in WWII Hitler knew he could not sustain Germany's military/industrial expansion without access to oil. Germany had no oil reserves and neither did any of its immediate neighbours. The closest oil reserves of any size were in the Caucasus mountains of Russia. So to meet Germany's need for oil, Hitler's strategy was to invade Russia and take theirs.

The actual invasion plan was not a strategic decision, but an operational one. At the military operational level, you are concerned primarily, if not solely, with military matters. So the decision to invade Russia was a strategic decision, but the decision of when and where to attack, and with what forces, were all operational decisions. Typically, strategic decisions are made by a country's political leaders while operational decisions are made by its senior military commanders.

=== Tactics ===

If you can smell the smoke and hear the gunfire, you're in a tactical situation. Tactical engagements are often called &quot;battles.&quot; The battles of The Alamo and Little Big Horn are famous examples of tactical battles. While strategic situations may take months, years or even decades to play out, tactical situations are usually resolved in a few minutes to a few days. In land combat, tactical decisions are made at the lower levels of the command structure, from junior officers down to individual soldiers. In naval combat, they are typically made by junior to senior level officers commanding anything from a single ship to a large carrier group. In air combat, tactical decisions are made by squadron leaders, who are typically mid-level officers, to individual pilots. Tactical decisions must typically be made quickly, under fire, and with immediate life-and-death consequences.

Decisions can however, be both a tactically good decision, but a strategically bad decision. This is how tactics and strategy are usually differentiated. For example, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor destroyed far more American military resources that Japanese military resources. This was a tactical victory by the Japanese, but the overall grand strategy was a failure because the events following Pearl Harbor resulted in Japan's defeat.

===Operations===

Between the political abstractions that characterize strategy and the minute-to-minute, life-and-death drama that characterizes tactics, lies the realm of operations. Operations tend to be strictly military affairs and are orchestrated by senior military commanders, generals and admirals. Operations tend to be unfold over days, weeks or even months and to involve large numbers of men and several battles. The Invasion of Normandy and the Tet Offensive are famous examples of recent military operations. The distinctions between these levels are fuzzy. For example, in the Battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War, there were actually a number of smaller tactical engagements, making the overall Battle of Gettysburg look more like an operational engagement than a tactical one.

==Military Branches and What They Do==

===The Army===

The primary job of the army is to take and control territory and to stop the enemy from doing the same. Modern armies are composed of basically 3 groups. First is the infantry, composed of individual soldiers fighting &quot;up close and personal&quot; with personal, hand-held weapons. This is the dirtiest, most dangerous, and most important job in the military. In the beginning was the infantry, and the infantry is still considered &quot;The Queen of the Battlefield.&quot; You can bomb the enemy's capital into a smoking rubble, but until your guys are walking around in its streets and cleared out any survivors, you can't claim to have conquered it.

Then there is the artillery, composed of big guns, or more recently, rockets. The guys firing the big guns rarely see their targets. They rely on forward observers to tell them where to shoot. An observer can be a guy on a hilltop, a guy in an airplane or anywhere they can see the target. This is called &quot;indirect fire.&quot; If the guys firing the guns can see their targets it is called &quot;direct fire.&quot; Artillery guys hate direct fire because it means the enemy is way too close. Half of all combat casualties are caused by artillery, so locating and destroying the enemy's artillery is always a high priority.

Finally, there is armour or tanks. Tanks specialize in moving quickly across relatively open ground and delivering a lot of fire-power. While tanks look big and imposing, they do have their vulnerabilities. Their main one is that they can't see very well. So tanks depend on infantry to be their eyes. A tank without infantry cover is very vulnerable. The Marines like to say that &quot;Hunting tanks is fun and easy.&quot; Tanks need room to move to be at their most effective, so they are of limited usefulness in heavy jungle or forest (like Vietnam), mountains (like Korea and much of Afghanistan), or in built-up cities (like Stalingrad). But in flat, open areas, like the deserts of Iraq and the steppes of Russia, they are fearsome indeed.

===The Navy===

Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans. The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods. One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain. At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic. Had the Allies failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.

In addition to this basic role, modern navies have developed other capabilities as well. An example is putting nuclear missiles into a submarine to turn it into a mobile, almost undetectable missile base. Submarines have also distinguished themselves as superb platforms from which to spy on the enemy. The recent best-seller ''Blind Man's Bluff'' is a gripping account of how this was done during the Cold War. The American navy has invested a lot to develop the ability to conduct amphibious assaults, that is, to attack from the sea using land-based forces (think D-Day). This is the primary mission of the U.S. Marines. Aircraft carriers also provide the navy with a mobile airfield which can be used to conduct air operations virtually anywhere in the world.

===The Air Force===

The introduction of aircraft in the early 20th Century adds a new dimension to warfare. That dimension reflects itself not only in new ways to deploy fire but also in boosting the ability of the ground troops to deploy their fire, supplying knowlegde about quantity, quality and disposition of opposing forces. Air power has a negative effect on the enemy's morale as well.

Since the introduction of balloons to spy on the enemy and to direct artillery barrages the importance of the aircraft rose exponentially: 
#balloons and reconaissance fixed-wing aircraft: spying, spotting
#air-superiority fighters: air-to-air fighting, gaining control of the air-space
#tactical bombers: targeting foes in the battlefield - JU-87 Stuka
#strategic bombers: destroying the enemy's ability to wage war - Allied campaign against the Axis
#rocket-proppeled unmanned one-use weapons - V1 and V2
#rotary-wing aircraft: both as gunships or transports
#multi-purpose unmanned aircraft: both as gunships or as reconnaissance

It's now impossible to disassociate ground and air power: the regular infantry or even small, commando-like units can call upon superior firepower in the form of airstrikes; small, highly mobile, unmanned aircraft can acquire information about enemy forces or infrastructure to direct ground operations. It's the exploration of all dimensions that deliver victory.

==Logistics==

Logistics is essentially distribution and delivery of supplies to troops. Supplies include anything from food rations, to additional soldiers, to munitions, to fuel and anything in between. As armies of an invading force moves out of it's home territory, supply lines are formed to deliver such supplies to soldiers fighting towards the front. Without supplies, soldiers will go hungry, vehicles will run out of fuel, guns will run out of ammunition, and armies will be unable to replace men lost in combat.

The concept of logistics has become increasingly important throughout the history of warfare. The more advanced military technology is, the more supplies necessary to continue a war effectively. For example, soldiers fighting with swords required far fewer and complicated supplies than soldiers fighting with gunpowder muskets. Today modern soldiers fighting with assault rifles with tanks and armored personnel carriers require a large variety of complicated supplies including ammunition, fuel, repair kits, additional weapons, etc.

Logistics is also part of strategy. During World War II the Chinese forces used a strategy where they purposely let the Japanese forces take land, while buying the Chinese forces time. Eventually the Japanese advance was halted as Japan simply could not find the supplies to reach further into China, while trying to fight an insurgency in the territory Japan occupied at the same time.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Harami. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Harami~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
[[w:Debugging|Debugging]] is the art of diagnosing errors in programs and determining how to correct them. &quot;Bugs&quot; come in a variety of forms, including: coding errors, design errors, complex interactions, poor user interface designs, and system failures.  Learning how to debug a program effectively, then, requires that you learn how to identify which sort of problem you're looking at, and apply the appropriate techniques to eliminate the problem.

Bugs are found throughout the software life cycle.  The programmer may find an issue, a software tester might identify a problem, or an end user might report an unexpected result.  Part of debugging effectively involves using the appropriate techniques to get necessary information from the different sources of problem reports.

The most common types of mistakes when programming are:
* Programming without thinking
* Writing code in an unstructured manner

== Bugs in Detail ==

What are these different kinds of bugs, then?

With coding errors, the source of the problem lies with programmer induced erroneous or improper code.  Some examples of coding errors include:
* Disregarding adopted conventions.
* Calling the wrong function (&quot;moveUp&quot;, instead of &quot;moveDown&quot;)
* Using the wrong variable names in the wrong places ( &quot;moveTo(y, x)&quot; instead of &quot;moveTo(x, y)&quot;)
* Failing to initialize a variable ( &quot;y = x + 1&quot;, where x has not been set) when absolutely required.
* Skipping a check for an error return.

Software users readily see some design errors, while in other cases design flaws make a program more difficult to improve or fix, and those flaws are not obvious to a user.  Obvious design flaws are often demonstrated by programs that run up against the limits of a computer, such as available memory, available disk space, available processor speed, and overwhelming input/output devices.  More difficult design errors fall into several categories:
* Failure to hide complexity
* Incomplete or ambiguous &quot;contracts&quot;
* Undocumented side effects

Complex interactivity bugs arise in scenarios where multiple parts of a single program, multiple programs, or multiple computers interact.

Poor user interface designs often lead users to use the program in ways that accomplish something other than what they intend.  For example, a &quot;search&quot; page for a web site might have an option for &quot;case-insensitive&quot; searching.  When the option is hard for the user to find or see, that user might report a bug that some of their data is &quot;lost&quot;, simply because it is not found by the case sensitive search.

Sometimes, computer hardware simply fails, and it usually does so in wildly unexpected ways.  Determining that the problem lies not with the software itself, but with the computer(s) on which it is usually complicated by the fact that the person debugging the software may not have access to the hardware that shows the problem.

== Preventing Bugs ==

No discussion of debugging software would be complete without a discussion of how to prevent bugs in the first place.  No matter how well you write code, if you write the wrong code, it won't help anyone.  If you create the right code, but users cannot work the user interface, you might as well have not written the code.  In short, a good debugger should keep an open mind about where the problem might lie.

Although it is outside the scope of this discussion to describe the myriad techniques for avoiding bugs, many of the techniques here are equally useful after the fact, when you have a bug and need to uncover it and fix it.  Thus, a brief discussion follows.

=== Understand the Problem ===

In order to write effective software, the developer must solve the problem the user needs solved.  Users, naturally enough, do not think in strict algorithms, windowing systems, web pages, or command line interfaces.  Rather, users think of their problems in the way that they think of their problems (yes, that is circular).

Sit down with the intended user, and ask them what they want from the software.  Users frequently want more than software can actually deliver, or have contradictory aims, such as software that does more, but doesn't require that they learn anything new.  In short, ask the users what their goals are.  Absent those goals, users will keep reporting bugs that do not add up to a coherent whole.

=== Effective Processes ===

=== Development Tools ===

=== Unit Testing ===
Unit testing means checking what happens in all possible states that the current module can enter. Therefore you should prepare a &quot;test list&quot; where you define all the possible inputs for current module. 
&lt;br /&gt;
For example: We have program that gets positive numbers from the user and process them. First we need to check if the input is a number (it can be a char), then we will check if it's positive. By checking I mean enter input and see what happens. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Hint: When you start to write this test list you'll notice that it's quite hard to predict all the possibilities; if you the option to ask someone else (that didn't help writing the module) to help it could be fruitful.

=== Documenting Code ===

== Basic debugging steps ==
Although each debugging experience is unique, certain general principles can be applied in debugging.  This section particularly addresses debugging software, although many of these principles can also be applied to debugging hardware.

The basic steps in debugging are:

* Recognize that a bug exists
* Isolate the source of the bug
* Identify the cause of the bug
* Determine a fix for the bug
* Apply the fix and test it

===Recognize a bug exists===
Detection of bugs can be done proactively or passively.

An experienced programmer often knows where errors are more likely to occur,
based on the complexity of sections of the program as well as possible data corruption.
For example, any data obtained from a user should be treated suspiciously.  Great care should be taken to verify that the format and content of the data are correct. Data obtained from transmissions should be checked to make sure the entire message (data) was received.
Complex data that must be parsed and/or processed may contain unexpected combinations of values that were not anticipated, and not handled correctly.
By inserting checks for likely error symptoms, the program can detect when data has been corrupted or not handled correctly.

If an error is severe enough to cause the program to terminate abnormally, the existence of a bug becomes obvious.
If the program detects a less serious problem, the bug can be recognized, provided error and/or log messages are monitored.
However, if the error is minor and only causes the wrong results, it becomes much more difficult to detect that a bug exists; this is especially true if it is difficult or impossible to verify the results of the program.

The goal of this step is to identify the symptoms of the bug.  Observing the symptoms of the problem, under what conditions the problem is detected, and what work-arounds, if any, have been found, will greatly help the remaining steps to debugging the problem.

===Isolate source of bug===
This step is often the most difficult (and therefore rewarding) step in debugging.
The idea is to identify what portion of the system is causing the error.
Unfortunately, the source of the problem isn't always the same as the source of the symptoms.
For example, if an input record is corrupted, an error may not occur until the program is processing a different record, or performing some action based on the erroneous information, which could happen long after the record was read.

This step often involves iterative testing.  The programmer might first verify that the input is correct, next if it was read correctly, processed correctly, etc.  For modular systems, this step can be a little easier by checking the validity of data passed across interfaces between different modules.  If the input was correct, but the output was not, then the source of the error is within the module.  By iteratively testing inputs and outputs, the debugger can identify within a few lines of code where the error is occurring.

Skilled debuggers are often able to hypothesize where the problem might be (based on analogies to previous similar situations), and test the inputs and outputs of the suspected areas of the program.  This form of debugging is an instance of the [[wikipedia:scientific method|scientific method]].  Less skilled debuggers often step sequentially through the program, looking for a place where the behavior of the program is different from that expected.  Note that this is still a form of scientific method as the programmer must decide what variables to examine when looking for unusual behavior.   Another approach is to use a &quot;[[wikipedia:binary search|binary search]]&quot; type of isolation process.  By testing sections near the middle of the data / processing flow, the programmer can determine if the error happens during earlier or later sections of the program.  If no data problems are detected, then the error is probably later in the process.

===Identify cause of bug===
Having found the location of the bug, the next step is to determine the actual cause of the bug, which might involve other sections of the program.  For example, if it has been determined that the program faults because a field is wrong, the next step is to identify why the field is wrong.  This is the actual source of the bug, although some would argue that the inability of a program to handle bad data can be considered a bug as well.

A good understanding of the system is vital to successfully identifying the source of the bug.  A trained debugger can isolate where a problem originates, but only someone familiar with the system can accurately identify the actual cause behind the error.  In some cases it might be external to the system: the input data was incorrect.  In other cases it might be due to a logic error, where correct data was handled incorrectly.  Other possibilities include unexpected values, where the initial assumptions were that a given field can  have only &quot;n&quot; values, when in fact, it can have more, as well as unexpected combinations of values in different fields (field x was only supposed to have that value when field y was something different). Another possibility is incorrect reference data, such as a lookup table containing incorrect values relative to the record that was corrupted.

Having determined the cause of the bug, it is a good idea to examine similar sections of the code to see if the same mistake is repeated elsewhere.  If the error was clearly a typo, this is less likely, but if the original programmer misunderstood the initial design and/or requirements, the same or similar mistakes could have been made elsewhere.

===Determine fix for bug===
Having identified the source of the problem, the next task is to determine how the problem can be fixed.  An intimate knowledge of the existing system is essential for all but the simplest of problems.  This is because the fix will modify the existing behavior of the system, which may produce unexpected results.  Furthermore, fixing an existing bug can often either create additional bugs, or expose other bugs that were already present in the program, but never exposed because of the original bug.  These problems are often caused by the program executing a previously untested branch of code, or under previously untested conditions.

In some cases, a fix is simple and obvious.  This is especially true for logic errors where the original design was implemented incorrectly.  On the other hand, if the problem uncovers a major design flaw that permeates a large portion of the system, then the fix might range from difficult to impossible, requiring a [[wikipedia:Rewrite (programming)|total rewrite]] of the application.

In some cases, it might be desirable to implement a &quot;quick fix&quot;, followed  by a more permanent fix.  This decision is often made by considering the severity, visibility, frequency, and side effects of the problem, as well as the nature of the fix, and product schedules (e.g., are there more pressing problems?).

===Fix and test===
After the fix has been applied, it is important to test the system and determine that the fix handles the former problem correctly.  Testing should be done for two purposes: (1) does the fix now handle the original problem correctly, and (2) make sure the fix hasn't created any undesirable side effects.

For large systems, it is a good idea to have [[wikipedia:Software testing|regression tests]], a series of test runs that exercise the system.  After significant changes and/or bug fixes, these  tests can be repeated at any time to verify that the system still executes as expected.  As new features are added, additional tests can be included in the test suite.

==Steps to reduce debugging==
There are concrete steps that can be taken to reduce the amount of time spent debugging software.  These are listed in the sections below.

===The correct mindset===
Probably the most important thing you can do when you are starting to debug a program is to realize that you don't understand what is going on.  Programmers who are convinced that their program should work fine are less likely to find errors simply because they are refusing to admit their confusion.  If the program behaved the way you think it does, you wouldn't be debugging; the program would be working fine.  Even when the program appears to work, if you examine it with the thought that there is at least one bug remaining and you are going to find it, then you are more likely to find something wrong with the program.

===Start at the source===
The time when you are most aware of where problems are more likely to arise is usually when first designing and writing the code.  By inserting integrity checks at various places within the program, problems can be detected and reported by the program itself.  In addition to detecting problems, considerations should be given as to how best to handle each error.  Options include:
*Report error, set invalid fields to a default value, and continue
*Report error, discard the record associated with the invalid value, and continue
*Report error, transfer invalid record into separate file/table so the user can examine and possibly correct the problem
*Report error and terminate the program

===Treat user input with suspicion===
Any data that originated from users (including external systems) should be treated with suspicion.  Carefully validate all such input data, performing syntactical and semantical integrity checks.  Such invalid data are a common source of programming errors.  Think not just of data entered in error, but malicious data as well, as in [[wikipedia:buffer overflow|buffer overflow]] exploits.

If data are entered interactively by users, you can provide appropriate [[wikipedia:error message|error message]]s and allow the user to correct the invalid field(s).  If data are not from an interactive source, then the erroneous records should be handled as described above.

===Use of log files===
Programs that write information to log files can provide significant information that can be used to analyze what was going on before, during, and after problems are encountered.  The number of entries to be searched can be reduced by creating various log files, such as a separate log for each major component of the system, plus one log file strictly for errors.  Each entry should be date/time stamped so that entries from different logs can be correlated.

===Test suites===
A standard set of tests that can be run to perform [[wikipedia:Regression testing|tests]] can assist in finding errors before they make it into production.  These test cases should be automated as much as possible to reduce the amount of effort required to perform these tests.  As new features are added to the system, additional tests should be created to exercise those features.

===Change one thing at a time===
When making a lot of changes, apply them incrementally.  Add one change, and then test that change thoroughly before starting on the next change.  This will reduce the number of possible sources of new bugs.  If several different changes are applied at the same time, then it is much more difficult to identify the source of the problem.  Furthermore, minor errors in different areas can interact to produce errors that never would have happened if those changes had been applied one at a time.

===Back out changes that have no effect===
If you make a change to fix a problem, but the program still behaves the same, back out those changes before proceeding.  The fact that your changes didn't do anything indicates one of several things:
*The problem is not where you think it is
*The area you modified either isn't being called, or isn't being called the way you think it is
*Assuming the section you changed wasn't executed, you might have introduced new bugs that won't appear until you fix the current bug

===Try another port of your Application===
Programs, that are available under different Architectures (e.g. Operation Systems like MS Windows, MacOSX, Linux or
Processors like Intel Pentium, PowerPC or DEC Alpha) sometimes react differently on other Systems (especially for subsequent errors). Sometimes it is far more easy to find the error on a different architecture.

===Think of similar situations===
When a bug has been found, think of other places where the same mistake might have been made.  Check those places and see if the same problem exists there as well.

== Finding User Interface Bugs ==

== Finding Design Bugs ==

== Finding Coding Errors ==

Not every kind of program is debugged in the same way and not all techniques can be used on all types of programs. 

The main character in debugging is the debugger. This is software which runs simultaneous with the newly written program and allows you to pause the program and read memory addresses, stack and various other normally invisible parts of your program. 

Another methode of debugging is the log-file. Outputting the contents of certain variables can provide valuable information on how your program performs. Outputting a string containing the name of the function when the function is called can be useful in locating when an error is introduced. For finding where a program crashes it's more practical to use the debugger.

Large programs are hard to debug, small programs are (relatively) easy to debug. So the key is to turn a large program into a lot of small programs for debugging. This is called &quot;Unit testing&quot; and involves compiling a part of your program (a routine, a collection of related routines, a module or even a complete subsystem) with extra code to allow it to run without the rest of the code in place. 

Full screen application (especially games) can be hard to debug as you won't be able to see the debuggers output. A solution lays in using a null-modem cable, a second computer and a terminal program (e.g. Hyperterminal). Pipe the output of the debugger through the null modem cable to the second computer.

 e.g. In Dos with gdb using a serial null modem cable:
 
 Configure the port with mode: mode COM2: 9600,n,8,1,none
 Pipe the output to COM2 by adding &gt;COM2 when you invoke the debugger.

===BlitImage255===
Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'PutImage',imageArray,[rect],[copyMode])

Copy &quot;imageArray&quot; to a window, slowly. &quot;imageArray&quot; may be double or uint8. Its
values, which should be non-negative integers, are copied to the window, by
CopyBits or CopyBitsQuickly. &quot;imageArray&quot; can be an MxN array (for any window)
or MxNx3 array (only if the window pixelSize is 16 or 32 bits). In the latter
case the three r g b components are combined, as appropriate for the window
pixelSize, to form a single value that is copied to the window. In 16-bit mode
r, g, and b each contribute 5 bits. In 32-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 8
bits.

&quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to &quot;rect&quot;, scaling if
necessary. The rect default is the imageArray's rect, centered in the window.
The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of MATLAB's
numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper
left, and the rows are horizontal. Unless you specify a &quot;Quickly&quot; copyMode,
PutImage inherits the behavior of CopyBits, scaling the image into the rect.

The copyMode argument is a string variable that is passed to the VideoToolbox
CopyWindows routine. copyMode can be 'srcCopy' (default) or 'bltFast'. 

The copying is done in two stages. First, slowly, from the image array into a
temporary offscreen window, and then, quickly, from there to the window
designated by &quot;windowPtr&quot;.
 
===BringMATLABToFront===

Usage:

SCREEN('MATLABToFront',[n])

Bring forward n-th window in MATLAB Window menu.  If not specified, n defaults
to 0 (the command window).
 
===BringWindowToFront===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowToFront')

Bring specified window to front.
 
===ClearScreen===
Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillRect',[color],[rect])

Fill &quot;rect&quot;. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this
window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire screen, so you can use this
function to clear the screen.
 
===Close===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'Close')

Close any of SCREEN's windows (on- or offscreen). Closing an on-screen window
takes about a second. After closing the last on-screen window the cursor is made
visible.
 
===CloseAll===

Usage:

SCREEN('CloseAll')

Close all of SCREEN's windows (on- and offscreen). Closing each on-screen window
takes about a second. After closing the last on-screen window the cursor is made
visible.
 
===CloseScreen===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'Close')

Close any of SCREEN's windows (on- or offscreen). Closing an on-screen window
takes about a second. After closing the last on-screen window the cursor is made
visible.
 

===Computer===

Usage:

desribeStruct=SCREEN('Computer')

Return information about the computer in a Matlab struct.
 
===CopyWindow===

Usage:

SCREEN('CopyWindow',srcWindowPtr,dstWindowPtr,[srcRect],[dstRect],[copyMode])

Copy images, very quickly, between two windows (on- or off- screen). copyMode
can be only 'srcCopy' on Win.  (default, will scale image to fit in dstRect).
Use with Rush for reliable timing. See Rush. 
 
===CopyWindows===

Usage:

SCREEN('CopyWindow',srcWindowPtr,dstWindowPtr,[srcRect],[dstRect],[copyMode])

Copy images, very quickly, between two windows (on- or off- screen). copyMode
can be only 'srcCopy' on Win.  (default, will scale image to fit in dstRect).
Use with Rush for reliable timing. See Rush. 
 

===DrawLine===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'DrawLine',[color],fromH,fromV,toH,toV,[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw a line. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel. Default is black. Default &quot;penWidth&quot; and &quot;penHeight&quot;
is 1. &quot;penMode&quot; specifies the drawing mode: The Win32 GDI interface does not
have support for these Copy, Or, xOr operatation. So the pen modes here
represent the line styles of the pen: 'patCopy' (solid pen, default), 'patOr'
(dashed), 'patXor' (dashdot), 'patBic' (dotted), 'notPatCopy' (invisible),
'notPatOr' (dashed), 'notPatXor' (dashdotdot), 'notPatBic' (inside frame).

Fill &quot;rect&quot;. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this
window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire screen, so you can use this
function to clear the screen.
 
===DrawText===

Usage:

[newX,newY] = SCREEN(windowPtr,'DrawText',text,[x],[y],[color])

Draw text. &quot;text&quot; may include two-byte characters (e.g. Chinese). Default &quot;x&quot;
&quot;y&quot; is current pen location. &quot;color&quot; is the CLUT index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with the
standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. &quot;newX,newY&quot; return the final pen
location. 
 
===FillArc===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillArc',[color],[rect],startAngle,arcAngle)

Draw a filled arc inscribed within the rect. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar
or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces
black with the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is
entire window. Angles are measured clockwise from vertical.
 
===FillOval===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillOval',[color],[rect])

Fills an ellipse with the given color, inscribed within &quot;rect&quot;.&quot;color&quot; is the
clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel;
default produces white with the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize.
Default rect is whole window.
 
===FillPoly===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillPoly',[color],pointList)

Fill polygon. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you
want to poke into each pixel; default produces white with the standard CLUT for
this window's pixelSize. &quot;pointList&quot; is a matrix: each row specifies the (x,y)
coordinates of a vertex.
 
===FillRect===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FillRect',[color],[rect])

Fill &quot;rect&quot;. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want
to poke into each pixel;  default produces white with the standard CLUT for this
window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire screen, so you can use this
function to clear the screen.
 
===FrameArc===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FrameArc',[color],[rect],startAngle,arcAngle,[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw an arc inscribed within the rect. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g
b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with
the standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire window.
Default pen size is 1,1 .Angles are measured in degrees, clockwise from vertical.

===FrameOval===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FrameOval',[color],[rect],[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw the outline of an oval.  &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with the
standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire window.
Default pen size is 1,1. 
 
===FrameRate===

Usage:

hz=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'FrameRate',[hz])

Frame rate, in Hz, as most recently measured for this screen (typically when you
first opened it). 

MacOS:
FrameRate counts frames over some measured period and calculates the rate.
Setting &quot;hz&quot; doesn't affect the screen, only the returned value. Setting &quot;hz&quot; to
NaN or [] forces SCREEN to remeasure it now, eg after you use a Control Panel to
change the screen resolution. The cached value is flushed when you close the
last window on this screen. 

Windows:
The returned value is the nominal frame rate, not the measured rate. The
returned value is always current.  FrameRate will accept an argument, for
compatibility with the MacOS implementation, but it ignores the value passed.
 
===FrameRect===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'FrameRect',[color],[rect],[penWidth],[penHeight],[penMode])

Draw the outline of a rectangle. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default produces black with the
standard CLUT for this window's pixelSize. Default &quot;rect&quot; is entire window.
Default pen size is 1,1. &quot;penMode&quot; specifies the drawing mode: The Win32 GDI
interface does not have support for these Copy, Or, xOr operatation. So these
pen modes here reprensent the line styles of the pen: 'patCopy' (solid pen,
default), 'patOr' (dashed), 'patXor' (dashdot), 'patBic' (dotted), 'notPatCopy'
(invisible), 'notPatOr' (dashed), 'notPatXor' (dashdotdot), 'notPatBic' (inside
frame). 
 
===Gamma===

Usage:

[oldGammaTable,dacSize]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Gamma',[gammaTable],[dacSize])

Get/set the gamma table. The gamma table will usually be 256x1 or 256x3. Most
users won't need this function. 
 
===GetClut===

Usage:

clut=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'GetClut',[bits])

Get the color lookup table (CLUT) of a video screen. The returned &quot;clut&quot; is a
3-column matrix with one row per RGB entry in the hardware CLUT. The &quot;clut&quot;
values will be in the range 0 to 255 for an 8-bit CLUT.
 

 
===GetFrontWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN('GetFrontWindow')

Get window pointer for frontmost window.

===GetImage===

Usage:

imageArray=SCREEN(windowPtr,'GetImage',[rect])

Slowly copy an image from a window, returning a MATLAB uint8 array. If the
window's pixelSize&gt;8 then the returned imageArray has three layers, an RGB
image. &quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates, and its default is the whole window.
CHANGE: as of April, 1998, imageArray is now uint8 instead of double to save
space (a factor of 8). However, MATLAB will issue an error if you try to do math
on a uint8 array, so you may need to use DOUBLE to convert it, e.g.
imageArray/255 will produce an error, but double(imageArray)/255 is ok. Also see
'PutImage' and 'CopyWindow'.
 
===GetImage255===

Usage:

imageArray=SCREEN(windowPtr,'GetImage',[rect])

Slowly copy an image from a window, returning a MATLAB uint8 array. If the
window's pixelSize&gt;8 then the returned imageArray has three layers, an RGB
image. &quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates, and its default is the whole window.
CHANGE: as of April, 1998, imageArray is now uint8 instead of double to save
space (a factor of 8). However, MATLAB will issue an error if you try to do math
on a uint8 array, so you may need to use DOUBLE to convert it, e.g.
imageArray/255 will produce an error, but double(imageArray)/255 is ok. Also see
'PutImage' and 'CopyWindow'.
 
===GetMATLABWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN('GetMATLABWindow',[n])

Get window pointer for n-th in MATLAB's Window menu.
 
===GetWindowByTitle===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN('GetWindowByTitle',title);

Get window pointer for window with specified title.
 
===GlobalRect===
SCREENGlobalRect not supported yet. 
 
===IsOffscreen===

Usage:

isOffscreen=SCREEN(windowPtr,'IsOffscreen')

Find out whether window is offscreen.  Responses: 1=yes; 0=no
 
===MATLABToFront===

Usage:

SCREEN('MATLABToFront',[n])

Bring forward n-th window in MATLAB Window menu.  If not specified, n defaults
to 0 (the command window).
 
===MoveWindow===
SCREENMoveWindow is not supported yet. 
 
===OpenOffscreenWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'OpenOffscreenWindow',[color],[rect],[pixelSize]);

Open an offscreen window (offscreen surface in DirectDraw). This is simply an
area in memory that is treated as a window. Offscreen windows are very useful
for creating images for subsequent display, because copying between windows is
very fast. You may specify a screen (a screenNumber&gt;=0) or no screen
(screenNumber=-1). If you do designate a screen then the offscreen window is
attached to the DirectDraw object associated with that screen. You may specify
no screen (screenNumber=-1), but any real screen must already have an open
SCREEN window when you call OpenOffscreenWindow. &quot;color&quot; is the clut index
(scalar or [r g b] triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default is
white. &quot;rect&quot; specifies the size of the offscreen window and what part of the
screen the offscreen window is aligned with. If supplied, &quot;rect&quot; must contain at
least one pixel. If a screenNumber is supplied then &quot;rect&quot; is in screen
coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the size of that screen. If
a screenNumber of -1 is supplied then &quot;rect&quot; defaults to the size of the main
screen. (In all cases, subsequent references to this new offscreen window will
use its coordinates: origin at its upper left.) &quot;pixelSize&quot; sets the depth (in
bits) of each pixel. If you specify a screen (screenNumber&gt;=0) and a pixelSize&gt;0
then they must be consistent. If you specify no screen (screenNumber=-1) then
the default pixelSize is the same as the main screen, but you can specify any
legal depth: 8, 16, 24, 32. A pixelSize of 0 or [] is replaced by the default.
 
===OpenWindow===

Usage:

[windowPtr,rect]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'OpenWindow',[color],[rect],[pixelSize]);

Open an onscreen window. Specify a screen by a windowPtr or a screenNumber (0 is
the main screen, with menu bar). &quot;color&quot; is the clut index (scalar or [r g b]
triplet) that you want to poke into each pixel; default is white. If supplied,
&quot;rect&quot; must contain at least one pixel. If a windowPtr is supplied then &quot;rect&quot;
is in the window's coordinates (origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole
window. If a screenNumber is supplied then &quot;rect&quot; is in screen coordinates
(origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole screen. (In all cases,
subsequent references to this new window will use its coordinates: origin at its
upper left.) The Windows version accepts &quot;rect&quot; but disregards it, the window is
always the size of the display on which it appears. &quot;pixelSize&quot; sets the depth
(in bits) of each pixel; default is to leave depth unchanged. Opening or closing
a window takes about a second. 
 
===PixelSize===

Usage:

[oldPixelSize,oldIsColor,pages]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'PixelSize',[pixelSize],[isColor])

Get/set screen depth, gray/color mode, and number of video pages. (We don't yet
provide a way of changing the page.)
 
===PixelSizes===

Usage:

pixelSizes=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'PixelSizes')

List all possible pixelSizes for this screen.The Windows Version returns only
pixel sizes available at the current display size.
 
===Preference===

Usage:

boolean=SCREEN('Preference','Backgrounding')
oldBoolean=SCREEN('Preference','IgnoreCase',[boolean])
psychTableVersion=SCREEN('Preference','PsychTableVersion')
mexFunctionName=SCREEN('Preference','PsychTableCreator')
oldPriority=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt',priority)
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt',[boolean])
bits=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','ClutDacSize')
boolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','FixedClut')
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking',[boolean])
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutQuickly',[boolean])
oldBoolean=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutCallsWaitBlanking',[boolean])
oldFrames=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Preference','SetClutSimulatesBlankingInterrupts',[frames])

Get/set various preferences. The first four are general, the rest are related to
WaitBlanking or SetClut and are screen-specific. &quot;boolean&quot; values are 1
(nonzero) for Yes and 0 for No. Preferences are volatile: They're set by SCREEN
when you first use each screen, and they're flushed by closing the last SCREEN
window (e.g. by 'Close', 'CloseAll', or flushing SCREEN.mex by typing &quot;clear
screen&quot;). So do any preference setting after calling 'OpenWindow'. WARNING:
These settings allow you to access all the internal parameters that determine
SCREEN's behavior. As a result the set of parameters is ever-changing, as SCREEN
evolves to deal with an ever-changing environment (e.g. video drivers that don't
wait for blanking, and Rush's high priority). Feel free to play with these
expert controls, but, if you do, realize that you may have to tweak your
'Preference' calls with each new release of the PsychToolbox.

- SetClutDriverWaitsForBlanking reports whether the monitor's video driver waits
for blanking. Usually read-only, you can also set/clear this on the PowerMac
7300/7500/7600/8500/8600 built-in driver.
- SetClutQuickly specifies your preference for whether to use a custom
SetEntriesQuickly.c driver (if available for this device) in place of the
standard video driver. The SetEntriesQuickly drivers don't wait for blanking.
- SetClutCallsWaitBlanking determines whether WaitBlanking should be called
after each call to SetClut.
- SetClutSimulatesBlankingInterrupts sets/gets the number of blanking interrupts
to simulate after each SetClut, to make up for interrupts missed during the
SetClut call.
- WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt specifies a preference for whether WaitBlanking
should use SetClut (original driver) or the screen's blanking interrupt to wait
for blanking. See 'WaitBlanking'.
- MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt specifies the maximum priority at which the
hardware blanking interrupt still works. Normally this is 1, but it's reduced to
0.5 (on non-PCI Macs) if necessary for timing the 3-ms interval during which
spurious VBL interrupts are ignored. Your programs can override this setting,
but your computer is likely to hang unless you really know what you're doing.

 
===PutColorImage===
PutColorImage is obsolete.  Use PutImage instead.
Please use SCREENPutImage.
 
===PutImage===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'PutImage',imageArray,[rect],[copyMode])

Copy &quot;imageArray&quot; to a window, slowly. &quot;imageArray&quot; may be double or uint8. Its
values, which should be non-negative integers, are copied to the window, by
CopyBits or CopyBitsQuickly. &quot;imageArray&quot; can be an MxN array (for any window)
or MxNx3 array (only if the window pixelSize is 16 or 32 bits). In the latter
case the three r g b components are combined, as appropriate for the window
pixelSize, to form a single value that is copied to the window. In 16-bit mode
r, g, and b each contribute 5 bits. In 32-bit mode r, g, and b each contribute 8
bits.

&quot;rect&quot; is in window coordinates. The whole image is copied to &quot;rect&quot;, scaling if
necessary. The rect default is the imageArray's rect, centered in the window.
The orientation of the array in the window is identical to that of MATLAB's
numerical array displays in the Command Window. The first pixel is in the upper
left, and the rows are horizontal. Unless you specify a &quot;Quickly&quot; copyMode,
PutImage inherits the behavior of CopyBits, scaling the image into the rect.

The copyMode argument is a string variable that is passed to the VideoToolbox
CopyWindows routine. copyMode can be 'srcCopy' (default) or 'bltFast'. 

The copying is done in two stages. First, slowly, from the image array into a
temporary offscreen window, and then, quickly, from there to the window
designated by &quot;windowPtr&quot;.
 
===Rect===

Usage:

rect=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Rect')

Get local rect of window or screen.
 
===Screens===

Usage:

screenNumbers=SCREEN('Screens')

Return an array of screenNumbers.
 
===SelectMATLAB===

Usage:

SCREEN('MATLABToFront',[n])

Bring forward n-th window in MATLAB Window menu.  If not specified, n defaults
to 0 (the command window).
 
===SetClut===

Usage:

err=SCREEN(windowPtr,'SetClut',clut,[startEntry],[bits])

Set the DirectDraw palette for the screen.

The palette is set immediately, without waiting for the vertical blanking.

The &quot;clut&quot; argument is a MATLAB matrix with 3 columns. The number of entries
written is the number of rows in &quot;clut&quot;. Each RGB entry in the hardware CLUT is
loaded with a row of &quot;clut&quot;. Each &quot;clut&quot; value should be in the range 0 to 255
for an 8-bit CLUT. Argument startEntry is optional and determines which CLUT
entry to load first (entries are numbered from 0 up), to load just a subset of
the CLUT's entries. 
We suggest that &quot;startEntry&quot; always be zero or greater. 

The &quot;bits&quot; argument specifies how many bits you want to write to the CLUT.
Typically it will be 8, which is the default value. If you set it to some other
value, the range of allowable entries scales accordingly. Thus if you use a
9-bit CLUT, then each entry should be between 0 and 511, etc. 

PREFERENCES:

===SetClutQ===

Usage:

err=SCREEN(windowPtr,'SetClut',clut,[startEntry],[bits])

Set the DirectDraw palette for the screen.

The palette is set immediately, without waiting for the vertical blanking.

The &quot;clut&quot; argument is a MATLAB matrix with 3 columns. The number of entries
written is the number of rows in &quot;clut&quot;. Each RGB entry in the hardware CLUT is
loaded with a row of &quot;clut&quot;. Each &quot;clut&quot; value should be in the range 0 to 255
for an 8-bit CLUT. Argument startEntry is optional and determines which CLUT
entry to load first (entries are numbered from 0 up), to load just a subset of
the CLUT's entries. 
We suggest that &quot;startEntry&quot; always be zero or greater. 

The &quot;bits&quot; argument specifies how many bits you want to write to the CLUT.
Typically it will be 8, which is the default value. If you set it to some other
value, the range of allowable entries scales accordingly. Thus if you use a
9-bit CLUT, then each entry should be between 0 and 511, etc. 

PREFERENCES:

===SetDrawingRegion===

Usage:

SCREEN(windowPtr,'SetDrawingRegion',shapeSpec,[shapeFlag])

Make subsequent drawing to the window visible only if it is within the specified
region. This does not apply to PutImage or CopyWindow operations. 
Call with rect equal to screenRect to reestablish the entire screen.  Drawing
outside the region is suppressed, but still takes the normal amount of time to
complete.

If shapeFlag == 0 [default], shapeSpec is a rect, region is rectangular.
If shapeFlag == 1, shapeSpec is a rect, region is oval.
If shapeFlag == 2, shapeSpec is a point list, region is polygonal.

 
===SetGamma===

Usage:

[oldGammaTable,dacSize]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'Gamma',[gammaTable],[dacSize])

Get/set the gamma table. The gamma table will usually be 256x1 or 256x3. Most
users won't need this function. 
 
===TextFace===

Usage:

oldStyle=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextStyle',[style])

Get/set the font style for future text draws in this window. Useful values for
style follow; they may be OR'd.

0=normal,1=bold,2=italic,4=underline. (Outline, Condense and Extend are not yet
supported on the Windows version)
 
===TextFont===

Usage:

[oldFontName,oldFontNumber]=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextFont',[fontNameOrNumber])

Get/set the font for future text draws in this window. You can ask what the
current font is, or specify the desired font by number or by name (e.g.
'Helvetica'). Font numbers may not be consistent from PC to PC.If no windowPtr
is given, and no fontName argument is supplied, then print out a list of all
font names. The default font (set by Windows) is 1 (the System font) for both
on-screen off-screen windows. 
 
===TextMode===

Usage:

oldCopyMode=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextMode',[copyMode])

Get/set text copy mode of this window.

copyMode can be an integer or a string: 'srcCopy' (default), 'srcOr', 'srcXor',
'srcBic', 'notSrcCopy', 'notSrcOr', 'notSrcXor', 'notSrcBic', 'patCopy',
'patOr', 'patXor', 'patBic', 'notPatCopy', 'notPatOr', 'notPatXor', 'notPatBic'.
On the Windows version, this function does nothing, since there is no apparent
options on Windows that correspond to the Mac text modes.
 
===TextSize===

Usage:

oldFontSize=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextSize',[fontSize])

Get/set the font size for future text draws in this window.
 
===TextStyle===

Usage:

oldStyle=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextStyle',[style])

Get/set the font style for future text draws in this window. Useful values for
style follow; they may be OR'd.

0=normal,1=bold,2=italic,4=underline. (Outline, Condense and Extend are not yet
supported on the Windows version)
 
===TextWidth===

Usage:

width=SCREEN(windowPtr,'TextWidth',text);	% horizontal offset (negative for right-to-left scripts, e.g. Hebrew).

Get width of text string. Width is the change in horizontal pen position that
would be produced by calling DrawText; it's negative for right-to-left scripts
(e.g. Hebrew). The text may include 2-byte characters (e.g. Chinese).
 
===UsageWarnings===

Usage:

[oldMore,oldSeverity,oldAlready]=SCREEN('UsageWarnings',[more],[severity],[already])

Control how usage warnings are handled.

Severity=0(suppress),1(warn), 2(error)
 
===VideoCard===

Usage:

[cardName,driverName,driverVersion,slotName]=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'VideoCard')

Get information about video hardware.
 
===WaitBlanking===

Usage:

framesSinceLastWait=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WaitBlanking',[waitFrames])

Wait specified number of blankings (frame endings). Call with waitFrames==1 (or
omit it, since that's the default) to wait for the beginning of the next frame.
Video cards mark the end of each video frame by briefly reducing the voltage to
the Vertical Blanking Level (VBL), which &quot;blanks&quot; the screen to black. We do all
video timing relative to the beginning of blanking. You may want to run
'WaitBlanking' at high priority (see Rush and Priority) for reliable timing. To
keep this routine as fast as possible, no value is returned unless you supply an
argument to receive it. When processor priority is at or below
MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt the WaitBlankingUsesInterrupt 'Preference'
controls, for each screen, whether 'WaitBlanking' calls SetClut (default) or
waits for a blanking interrupt. When processor priority is above
MaxPriorityForBlankingInterrupt, 'WaitBlanking' always uses SetClut (i.e.
cscSetEntries or cscDirectSetEntries call to video driver).
 
===WaitVBL===

Usage:

framesSinceLastWait=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WaitBlanking',[waitFrames])

Wait specified number of blankings (frame endings). Call with waitFrames==1 (or
omit it, since that's the default) to wait for the beginning of the next frame.
Video cards mark the end of each video frame by briefly reducing the voltage to
the Vertical Blanking Level (VBL), which &quot;blanks&quot; the screen to black. We do all

===WindowKind===

Usage:

kind=SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowKind')

What kind of windowPtr is this? Returns 0 if it's invalid, -1 our offscreen, 1
our onscreen, 2 MATLAB's onscreen.
 
===Windows===

Usage:

windowPtrs=SCREEN('Windows')

Return an array of windowPtrs.
 
===WindowScreenNumber===

Usage:

screenNumber=SCREEN(windowPtrOrScreenNumber,'WindowScreenNumber')

Get the screen number.
 
===WindowTitle===

Usage:

title=SCREEN(windowPtr,'WindowTitle')

Get window's title
 
===WindowToBack===

Usage:

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Ada is very well suited for all kind of calculations. You can define you own fixed point and floating point types and &amp;mdash; with the aid of generic packages call all the mathematical functions you need. In that respect Ada is on par with [[Programming:Fortran|Fortran]]. This module will show you how to use them and while we progress we create a simple [[wikipedia:Reverse Polish notation|RPN]] calculator.

== Simple calculations ==

=== [[Wikipedia:Addition|Addition]] ===

Additions can be done using the predefined operator {{Ada/operator|+}}. The operator is predefined for all numeric types and the following, working code, demonstrates its use:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|numeric_1.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/--|{{Ada/95/RM|A|10|1|title=The Package Text_IO}}}}
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Numeric_1 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Value_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}} 12
          {{Ada/kw|range}} -999_999_999_999.0e999 .. 999_999_999_999.0e999;
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} F_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO (Value_Type);
 
    Value_1 : Value_Type;
    Value_2 : Value_Type;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;First Value : &quot;);
    F_IO.Get (Value_1);
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Second Value : &quot;);
    F_IO.Get (Value_2);
 
    F_IO.Put (Value_1);
    T_IO.Put (&quot; + &quot;);
    F_IO.Put (Value_2);
    T_IO.Put (&quot; = &quot;);
    F_IO.Put (Value_1 {{Ada/operator|+}} Value_2);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Numeric_1;

=== [[Wikipedia:Subtraction|Subtraction]] ===

Subtractions can be done using the predefined operator {{Ada/operator|-}}. The following extended demo shows the use of + and - operator together:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|numeric_2.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/--|{{Ada/95/RM|A|10|1|title=The Package Text_IO}}}}
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Numeric_2
 {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Value_Type
   {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}}
      12
   {{Ada/kw|range}}
      -999_999_999_999.0e999 .. 999_999_999_999.0e999;
 
   {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
   {{Ada/kw|package}} F_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO (Value_Type);
 
   Value_1   : Value_Type;
   Value_2   : Value_Type;
   Result    : Value_Type;
   Operation : Character;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   T_IO.Put (&quot;First Value  : &quot;);
   F_IO.Get (Value_1);
   T_IO.Put (&quot;Second Value : &quot;);
   F_IO.Get (Value_2);
   T_IO.Put (&quot;Operation    : &quot;);
   T_IO.Get (Operation);
 
   {{Ada/kw|case}} Operation {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|when}} '+' =&gt;
         Result := Value_1 + Value_2;
      {{Ada/kw|when}} '-' =&gt;
         Result := Value_1 - Value_2;
      {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt;
         T_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Illegal Operation.&quot;);
         {{Ada/kw|goto}} Exit_Numeric_2;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
 
   F_IO.Put (Value_1);
   T_IO.Put (&quot; &quot;);
   T_IO.Put (Operation);
   T_IO.Put (&quot; &quot;);
   F_IO.Put (Value_2);
   T_IO.Put (&quot; = &quot;);
   F_IO.Put (Result);
 
 {{Ada/dl|&lt;&lt;}}Exit_Numeric_2{{Ada/dl|&gt;&gt;}}
   {{Ada/kw|return}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Numeric_2;

Purists might be surprised about the use of goto &amp;mdash; but some people prefer the use of goto over the use of multiple return statements if inside functions &amp;mdash; given that, the opinions on this topic vary strongly. See the [[Ada Programming/Control#Isn.27t_goto_evil.3F|isn't goto evil]] article.

=== [[Wikipedia:Multiplication|Multiplication]] ===

Multiplication can be done using the predefined operator {{Ada/operator|*}}. For a demo see the next chapter about Division.

=== [[Wikipedia:Division (mathematics)|Division]] ===

Divisions can be done using the predefined operators {{Ada/operator|/}}, {{Ada/operator|mod}}, {{Ada/operator|rem}}. The operator {{Ada/operator|/}} performs a normal division, {{Ada/operator|mod}} returns a modulus division and {{Ada/operator|rem}} returns the remainder of the modulus division.

The following extended demo shows the use of the {{Ada/operator|+}}, {{Ada/operator|-}}, {{Ada/operator|*}} and {{Ada/operator|/}} operators together as well as the use of a four number wide stack to store intermediate results:

The operators {{Ada/operator|mod}} and {{Ada/operator|rem}} are not part of the demonstration as they are only defined for integer types.

== [[Wikipedia:Exponentiation|Exponential]] calculations ==

All exponential functions are defined inside the generic package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}}.

=== [[Wikipedia:Exponentiation|Power of]] ===

Calculation of the form &lt;math&gt;x^y&lt;/math&gt; are performed by the  operator {{Ada/operator|**}}. Beware: There are two versions of this operator. The predefined operator {{Ada/operator|**}} allows only for Standard.Integer to be used as exponent. If you need to use a floating point type as exponent you need to use the {{Ada/operator|**}} defined in {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}}.

=== [[Wikipedia:Root (mathematics)|Root]] ===

The square root &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{x} &lt;/math&gt; is calculated with the function &lt;code&gt;Sqrt()&lt;/code&gt;. There is no function defined to calculate an arbitrary root &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}&lt;/math&gt;. However you can use logarithms to calculate an arbitrary root using the mathematical identity: &lt;math&gt; \sqrt[b]{a} = e^{\log_e (a) / b} &lt;/math&gt; which will become &lt;code&gt;root := Exp (Log (a) / b)&lt;code&gt; in Ada. Alternatively, use &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[b]{a}=a^{\frac1b}&lt;/math&gt; which, in Ada, is &lt;code&gt;root := a**(1.0/b)&lt;/code&gt;.

=== [[Wikipedia:Logarithm|Logarithm]] ===

{{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}} defines a function for both the arbitrary logarithm &lt;math&gt;log_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the natural logarithm &lt;math&gt;log_e(x)&lt;/math&gt;, both of which have the same name &lt;code&gt;Log()&lt;/code&gt; distinguished by the number of parameters.

=== Demonstration ===

The following extended demo shows the how to use the exponential functions  in Ada. The new demo also uses [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Strings.Unbounded|Unbounded_String]] instead of Strings which make the comparisons easier.

Please note that from now on we won't copy the full sources any more. Do follow the download links to see the full program.

=== [[Wikipedia:Trigonometry|Trigonometric]] calculations ===

The full set of [[/Trigonometry|trigonometric]] functions are defined inside the generic package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Elementary_Functions}}. All functions are defined for 2π and an arbitrary cycle value (a full cycle of revolution).

Please note the difference of calling the &lt;code&gt;Arctan ()&lt;/code&gt; function.

The Demo also contains an improved numeric output which behaves more like a normal calculator.

As added bonus this version supports error handling and therefore won't just crash when an illegal calculation is performed.

=== [[Wikipedia:Complex number|Complex]] arithmethic ===

For [[Algebra/Complex Numbers|complex arithmetic]] Ada provides the package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Types}}. This package is part of the &quot;special need Annexes&quot; which means it is optional. The open source Ada compiler GNAT implements all &quot;special need Annexes&quot; and therefore has complex arithmetic available.

Since Ada supports user defined operators, all &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/operator|+}}, {{Ada/operator|-}}, {{Ada/operator|*}})&lt;/small&gt; operators have their usual meaning as soon as the package {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Types}} has been instantiated &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/kw|package}} ... {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} ...)&lt;/small&gt; and the type has been made visible &lt;small&gt;({{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|type}} ...)&lt;/small&gt;

Ada also provides the packages {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Complex_IO}} and {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Elementary_Functions}} which provide similar functionality to their normal counterparts. But there are some differences:

* {{Ada/package|Ada|Numerics|Generic_Complex_Elementary_Functions}} supports only the exponential and trigonometric functions which make sense in complex arithmetic.

* {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Complex_IO}} is a child package of {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} and therefore needs its own {{Ada/kw|with}}. Note: the &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO|Complex_IO}}Get ()&lt;code&gt; function is pretty fault tolerant - if you forget the &quot;,&quot; or the &quot;()&quot; pair it will still parse the input correctly.

So, with only a very few modifications you can convert your &quot;normals&quot; calculator to a calculator for complex arithmetic:

=== [[Linear Algebra/Vectors in Space|Vector]] and [[Linear_Algebra/Describing_the_Solution_Set#matrix|Matrix]] Arithmetic ===

Ada supports [[Linear Algebra/Vectors in Space|vector]] and [[Linear_Algebra/Describing_the_Solution_Set#matrix|matrix]] Arithmetic for both normal real types and complex types. For those, the generic packages Ada.Numerics.Generic_Real_Arrays and Ada.Numerics.Generic_Complex_Arrays are used. Both packages offer the usual set of operations, however there is no I/O package and understandably, no package for elementary functions.

Since there is no I/O package for vector and matrix I/O creating a demo is by far more complex &amp;mdash; and hence not ready yet. You can have a look at the current progress which will be a universal calculator merging all feature.

Status: Stalled - for a Vector and Matrix stack we need Indefinite_Vectors &amp;mdash; which are currently not part of GNAT/Pro. Well I could use the booch components ...

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the United States, [[w:Genealogy|genealogy]] is a major and growing hobby, aided in large part by the increasing availability of both free and subscription on-line information resources.  This chapter contains information on some of these on-line resources as a beginning to a more thorough treatment of the pecularities of pursuing genealogy research in the United States.  The point of view taken here is largely that of an individual looking into his or her own history.

==Genealogy Resources On-Line==
====USGenWeb Project====
* [http://www.usgenweb.org/ USGenWeb Project] established in 1996, this project of 2500 volunteers has been serving as a FREE resource for county and state genealogy.  Besides the independent websites there is a permanent Archive of 11 G's of information.  The search engine for the USGenWeb Project Archives is located at http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgenweb/newsearch.htm.  And the many special projects supported by the members of the USGenWeb Project can be found at http://usgenweb.org/projects/index.shtml
====Cyndi's List==== 

* [http://www.cyndislist.com/ Cyndi's List] before there was http://www.Google.com there was Cyndi's List.  Nine years later her website contains 243,200 genealogy related links. A FREE website.
====Family Search==== 
* [http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/frameset_search.asp  Family Search]it is associated with the LDS church and is a gateway to 150 years of genealogy research done by church members and other genealogists. A FREE website

==Immigration==
The vast majority of Americans are descendents of immigrants within the past 400 years.  One of the points of interest for most researchers is &quot;when did my family arrive in the United States?&quot;  This invariably has multiple answers as a result of mingling blood lines immigrant groups or distinct waves of immigrants.  There are basically two parts to this question: &quot;where was the entry point?&quot; and &quot;when was the entry time?&quot;  In many cases a researcher has one of these two pieces of information, often as an anecdote passed down orally through the family.

===Major entry points===
====New York and Ellis Island====
One of the most significant entry points in the United States in terms of the sheer volume of persons passing through it was [[w:Ellis Island|Ellis Island, New York]].  Millions of immigrants entered the country through this point during its years of operation from 1892 to 1924.  In 1982, [[w:Lee Iacocca|Lee Iacocca]], at the behest of [[w:Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan]], headed the formation of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation (SOLEIF).  In 2001, an activity of this foundation led to the establishment of the American Family Immigration History Center, which has made available on-line 25,000,000 immigrant arrival records for public access.  The website for the Foundation, which prominently features a search interface for this set of records, is located at http://www.ellisisland.org/.

== metric symbols ==

The '''liter''' is abbreviated as [[Cookbook:L|L]].
The '''milliliter''' is abbreviated as [[Cookbook:mL|mL]].

There is no metric unit designated by a lowercase l. This would be confused with the number 1 and uppercase letter I.

== Pie Crust ==

[[Cookbook:Lemon_Meringue_Pie]] and [[Cookbook:Banana_Cream_Pie]] have very similar crusts. Since the crust is useful by itself, and duplication leads to inconsistency, I was thinking I'd move the crust instructions to a new [[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust]] page. I hope you don't mind.

Problem is, the recipes are already inconsistent. I don't know if this is intentional or not. The banana one wants &quot;1 egg, whipped&quot; (the white included?), while the lemon one wants &quot;1 egg yolk&quot; (not whipped?). Even if this is intentional, it would be nice to move the more-normal of the two (the banana one?) to a page by itself.

BTW, if you think I'd be responsible and useful as an admin, please support [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#AlbertCahalan|my adminship request]]. I have well over 1500 wiki edits, which has been enough to earn me a few enemies it seems. (sorry I'm not perfect; I've probably made a few dreadful edits but I have shown responsibility elsewhere, including as a Tux Paint and procps developer)

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:43, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

::In the crust recipe the egg white is really optional. When making the Lemon Meringue Pie, I use the egg white in the Meringue, where it is more useful. When making the Banana Cream Pie, I just use the whole egg in the crust. This pie crust recipe, using vinegar, results in a consistently good flaky crust. Other pie crust recipes I've tried, turn out in a tough crust. Probably because this recipe tolerates handeling more than others. I will vote for you. [[User:Reubenbarton|Reubenbarton]] 19:17, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

It's interesting that the crust uses 100% shortening. Very old pie crust recipies use lard, which is supposedly the best. Shortening was developed as a lard substitute. Shortening keeps longer and has less saturated fat, but it does have ''trans-'' fats which are now thought to be worse than saturated fats. It seems that modern pie crust recipes are moving towards the use of butter, which seems very wrong to me. Butter does not have the same melting properties and it contains almost 20% non-fat content. Butter even has more saturated fat than lard, so it isn't the choice to make for health. Since lard is the most healthful of the choices and seems like a perfect drop-in alternative to shortening, it might deserve a mention. Perhaps you could try it. I just bought a tub of lard to replace my shortening, but I'm not exactly a pie expert, and the hot weather here would probably make for a bad pie crust no matter what recipe I use. Do you use a chilled surface, chilled roller, or strong air conditioning? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:09, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::I have used lard in pie crusts and biscuits. Lard makes a more flaky crust. It also makes a far superior biscuit. Lard gives the crust a different flavor than shortening. Shortening doesn't really have a flavor, but lard does. Lard can also impart a slight flavor to other things like cookies. I guess my aversion to using lard is because of being told for so many years that lard and animal fat are &quot;bad&quot; for you. It seems that every other year some health study comes out pointing in a different direction. But I do use lard on occasion. The other points you make are also true. Shortening is easier to store and use. I live in Sacramento, California. In the summer, temperatures here reach 100-degrees F. for days on end. My house is air conditioned. I also chill the shortening. For me, cooking is a hobby and my wife enjoys the break when she doesn't have to cook. [[User:Reubenbarton|Reubenbarton]] 01:47, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::Heh. Yeah, I know! It felt weird buying a tub of lard last week. Lard sure did get a bad reputation, but it seems to be the best of the well-known ''solid'' fats. You can't make a pie crust with olive oil... or can you? Compared to most liquid oils, '''all''' the solid fats are bad. People used to fry in lard, which certainly doesn't make sense when Canola oil works so well now. (never fry in olive oil; it will smoke) I'll guess that the major past abuse of lard was for frying french fries, for which there are many good alternatives. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:10, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::: According to [http://www.hormel.com/templates/knowledge/knowledge.asp?catitemid=42&amp;id=571], olive oil has a higher smoke point than canola. Go figure. Corn oil is the traditional choice for a frying oil (I belive most donuts these days are fried in corn). Donuts in particular used to be fried in coconut oil (or lard), which has a much higher level of saturated fat (like lard) but does not suffer from many of the problems of [partially-]hydrogenated oils or heated unsaturated fats (which are hydrogenated to some degree by being heated). From [http://www.fi.edu/brain/fats.htm#brainblockers]: &quot;... if French fries were cooked in saturated fat instead of in hydrogenated vegetable oils, they would probably be safer.&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 03:21, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::::: That's a very cheap solvent-extracted olive oil then. The smoke point of olive oil varies greatly. The [[Cookbook:Smoke_Point|numbers we have]] show olive oil at 200-406 ºF and Canola at 440 ºF. When people say that olive oil is especially good for you, they're referring to the greenish flavorful kind that smokes at only 200ºF. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:08, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Reubenbarton. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Reubenbarton~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Examples==

*[[MATLAB Programming/Psychtoolbox/Example Code/Imageviewer|Imageviewer]] - show an image on the screen (OSX)
*[[MATLAB Programming/Psychtoolbox/Example Code/OpenManyScreens| OpenManyScreens]] - open a window on all connected displays (OSX)
*[[MATLAB Programming/Psychtoolbox/Example Code/xsearch| xsearch]] - generic visual search code (OS9/WIN)
* [http://csclab.ucsd.edu/~alan/vision/matlab_code/imgshow.html ImgShow ] - loads a series of images from disk and displays them for the period of time specified, in random order (OS9/WIN)
* [[MATLAB Programming/Psychtoolbox/eyelink toolbox|eyelink toolbox]] - use an sr-research eyelink video eyetracker together with the cross-platform opengl psychtoolbox (OSX/win)

==Helpful scripts==
*[[MATLAB Programming/Psychtoolbox/Version independent scripts]] - Scripts to allow you to write programs that run on all versions of psychtoolbox.

==Code Snippets==

* Function that takes a list of desired keys and returns the number of the one that was pressed and is nearer to the front of the list that was passed. It ignores other keypresses.
&lt;pre&gt;
 function keyPressed = getKeys(keysWanted) % keysWanted is a matrix list of keys you are 
                                           % waiting for e.g, [124 125 kbName('space')]
  FlushEvents('keydown');
  success = 0;
  while success == 0
   pressed = 0;
   while pressed == 0
    [pressed, secs, kbData] = KbCheck;
   end;
    for i = 1:length(keysWanted)
      if kbData(keysWanted(i)) == 1
       success = 1;
       keyPressed = keysWanted(i);
       FlushEvents('keydown');
       break;
      end;
    end;
    FlushEvents('keydown');
   end;
&lt;/pre&gt;
   

* Wait for a key press, continue after two seconds
&lt;pre&gt;
  tEnd=GetSecs+2;
  while ~KbCheck &amp; GetSecs&lt;tEnd
    % Sleep one millisecond after each check, so we don't
    % overload the system in Rush or Priority &gt; 0
    WaitSecs(0.001);
  end
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Bring command window to front. Even though it won't come in front of a window opened by Screen, it is useful to include this, as it allows you to type e.g. Screen('Closeall') to close the window of a crashed program
&lt;pre&gt;
commandwindow;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Issue: KbCheck doesn't appear to wait for key presses, exits loop earlier then expected, continues to return key presses. Solution: make sure you first wait for any keys to be released. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
commandwindow;
touch=1;
while touch==1
    [touch, secs, keycode] = KbCheck;
    % Sleep one millisecond after each check, so we don't
    % overload the system in Rush or Priority &gt; 0
    WaitSecs(0.001);
end
touch = 0;
i=0;
while ~touch
 % Sleep one millisecond after each check, so we don't
 % overload the system in Rush or Priority &gt; 0
 WaitSecs(0.001);
 [touch, secs, keycode] = KbCheck;
 fprintf('.');
 if i==50
  fprintf('\n');
  i=0;
 end
 i=i+1;
end
clc; % clear command window, removing any typed characters
fprintf('\ntouch down\n\n');
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Everyone!  Bill Beaty here.  &quot;Static electricity is electricity which is static&quot; is a common misconception which has made its way into K6 textbooks.  In fact, &quot;Static&quot; electricity retains all of its characteristics even when it flows, therefore its unmoving-ness is not important in understanding it.  A better definition: ''Static electricity occurs whenever a piece of matter contains more protons than electrons, or when it contains more electrons than protons.''  Or this one:''When the positive and negative charges in matter are not equal, the matter has a charge imbalance.  We call this imbalance by the name Static Electricity.''  Remember that rubbing some fur against some rubber does not create any charges of electricity, instead it creates an ''imbalance'' of charges (the charges, the electrons and protons, were already there beforehand.)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|US Cuisine]]

This is a pastry shell pie filled with fresh sliced bananas in a vanilla pudding type base. A layer of whipped cream is added to the top.

==Ingredients==
===[[Cookbook:Pie Crust|Pie crust]]===
*[[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust|Grandma's Pie Crust]].

===Pie filling===
*1/2 cup white granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*6 tablespoons [[cookbook:Flour|all purpose flour]]
*1/4 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
*2 1/2 cups [[cookbook:milk|milk]]
*1 [[cookbook:egg|egg]], whipped
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
*4 ripe [[cookbook:banana|banana]]s, sliced
*1/4 cup [[cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]

===Pie topping===
*1/2 cup [[cookbook:Cream|heavy cream]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
*1 1/2 teaspoons [[cookbook:powdered sugar|powdered sugar]]

==Procedure==
===Pie crust===
#Prepare [[Cookbook:Grandma's Pie Crust|Grandma's Pie Crust]].

===Pie filling===
#In the top of a [[cookbook:double boiler|double boiler]], [[cookbook:whisk|whisk]] together sugar, flour, salt and milk. Stir out any lumps.
#Bring water to [[cookbook:boiling|boiling]] in lower portion of double boiler.
#Stir constantly until mixture is thickened, about 5-minutes.
#Place lid on mixture and continue cooking for 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
#Beat egg in a small bowl. Add about 1/2 cup of hot pie filling mixture to egg in bowl and stir well. This tempers the egg so it won't scramble when added to the hot pie filling.
#Pour tempered egg mixture into pan of hot pie filling. Stir constantly and cook for 2 more minutes.
#Remove from heat, add butter and vanilla. Stir until mixed.
#Slice 2 bananas. Dip slices in lemon juice, shake off excess and distribute banana slices in the bottom of baked pie shell.
#Pour half of pie filling over bananas in bottom of pie shell. Make sure banana slices are covered by pie filling.
#Slice remaining 2 bananas. Dip in lemon juice, shake off excess and arrange on top of filling in pie.
#Pour remainder of pie filling over second layer of bananas in pie shell. Cover all bananas with filling.
#Chill for about 1 hour before adding topping.


===Pie topping===
#In a large bowl, whip cream with [[cookbook:electric mixer|electric mixer]] until peaks are just forming.
#Beat vanilla and sugar into cream and continue mixing until peaks form in cream.
#Don't over beat the mixture or it will form lumps and begin to turn to butter.
#Spread whipped cream mixture over pie filling on chilled pie. Keep chilled until served.

==Warnings==
The pie filling is quite hot when pouring it into pie shell. Keep this pie refrigerated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikicode vs. HTML tags ==

The [[Template:Ada/attribute]] template was fully written with wikicode (two quotes), but later it was changed to HTML tags because sometimes there where some visualisation problems: Those two quotes of the template when placed after the quote of the attribute of the code became boldface in wikicode. For that reason it where changed to &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tags, doing the same with the other two templates: [[Template:Adakw]], [[Template:Ada/operator]]. And although in principle there couldn't happen the same problem with those two, I think it's safer to stick to HTML tags. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 20:57, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Dann sollten wir auch Template:Ada/operator_2 anpassen ;-) --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:27, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: Sorry? Automatic translation, is it correct?: ''Then we should adapt also [[Template:Ada/operator 2]] ;-)''. I didn't know that this template existed. Added to [[Template:Ada]] and put HTML tags. Thanks for pointing it out! --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 08:23, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Ups. did not notice that I wrote german. We will also need a 2nd version for special - because both operator and special need to display characters which wiki won't like. I will do it as soon as there is time - rigth now my wife waits for me.--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:42, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

''For laptop users: You might have to turn on the &quot;Emulate Numpad&quot; option if you don't have a number pad on your laptop. This is found above the &quot;File,&quot; &quot;Add,&quot; &quot;Timeline,&quot; [etc.] pullout bar under &quot;System and OpenGL&quot; (also called the &quot;User Preferences&quot; bar later on).''

I've searched for this for a long time and havent found .... I don't have the &quot;System and OpenGL&quot; bar, only the &quot;User Preferences&quot; bar.
Where is this option ???? --[[User:Wladston|Wladston]] 13:24, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

Found it. Put your mouse cursor just under the bottom edge of the &quot;File&quot; menu bar, and drag down. A new panel will open. Dennis G. Jerz, 12 July 2006.

== More Syntax ==

Should we include syntax examples for things like menu paths? With so many different users people are constantently using different ways such as:

'''SPACE'''''&amp;rarr;Add&amp;rarr;Lamp''

'''SPACE''' &gt; Add &gt; lamp ''etc''...

and '''SPACE''' -&gt; ''Add'' -&gt; ''lamp''

So how should we display these paths?

Also some people use 'return' when we seem to have always used '''ENTER'''.. hmmm --[[User:Kisubo|Kisubo]] 01:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
----


Yes, i think we should. I like the first one with &amp;rarr;.

I also think there should be a global syntax for menu items and values and thelike. This would make them stick out of the text much better and thus the tutorial can be easier referred back to. Like when you've already finished the tutorial before but forgot about a certain function or something. Then it would be easier to find those remarks, if you don't have to read through it again.
Using italic letters with quotation marks would be a start (like &quot;''File''&quot; menu).

==Mac Users without multi-button mice==

&lt;strike&gt;So now there's a section for Mac single-button mice, but on my iMac, running Blender 2.41, I'm finding what's been written here to be inaccurate; did it change at some point?  For me, LMB is regular click, RMB is Apple+click, MMB is Option+click, and I'm fairly certain I haven't changed any of the defaults...&lt;/strike&gt;.

Ok, I looked a bit further, and saw text in the ''Blender Windowing System'' page that said part of this.  I duplicated it here, but am guessing that it probably shouldn't be in both places.

[[User:DavidJaquay|DavidJaquay]] 20:52, 8 May 2006 (UTC)


== Key sequence ==
It would be fine to add some syntax about key sequence : how to write the '''CTRL''', '''SHIFT''', '''MKEY''' sequence ?

I think it should be : '''CTRL + SHIFT + MKEY''' ( some people write : '''CTRL-SHIFT-M''' ).
Others : '''ALT''', '''MKEY''' : '''ALT + MKEY''' ( some people write : '''ALT-M''' ).
--[[User:N comme Nul|N comme Nul]] 14:57, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

== Reformated content ==
I've reformated content to use footnotes on this page, as well as imported in the ''Non-standard equipment'' from other chapters. The purpose:
* To eliminate redundancy, and better overall book content by centralizing niche stuff.
* To better equip those with non-standard equipment early on
I've also use the wikibook syntax, if someone likes those old orange tables, feel free to add a ''style-sheet'' for them. [[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] 17:00, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

== Mac Command key ==
On the newer Mac keyboard they have removed the Apple logo form the command key. Since the command key has had this weird character (&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#8984;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) on it for so long it might be easier to refer to it by the character itself.

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#8984;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Microsoft Excel is a deep program rich in features and functionality. One of the most powerful features of Excel is the ability to write programs in Visual Basic for Applications that run &quot;behind&quot; your worksheets to turn Excel into a calculation-oriented development platform for creating special purpose spreadsheets which can function as applications in their own right.

== Service Pack ==
A '''service pack''' (in short '''SP''') is a collection of updates, fixes or enhancements to a software program delivered in the form of a single installable package.

A service pack can be incremental, which means it only contains the updates that were not present in the previous service packs or, it can be cumulative, which means it includes the contents of all its predecessors. In the case of Microsoft's products, an incremental update was called a service release. For example, Office 2000 must be upgraded to '''service release''' 1 ('''SR'''-1) before one can install SP2.

== Macro Security ==
Macro security settings are located in the Trust Center. However, if you work in an organization, your system administrator might have changed the default settings to prevent anyone from changing any settings and execute macros.

==Macro Recording==
A great way of learning about Excel VBA is using its macro recording function. With the function, you tell Excel to start recording, then perform various steps as if you were working without a macro recorder, and finally, tell Excel to stop recording. VBA code corresponding to what you did using Excel GUI has been recorded by Excel. While the code often cannot be meaningfully used without a modification, by starting from it and modifying it you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent reading the VBA documentation.

Menu paths:
* Excel 2000, 2003: Tools &gt; Macro &gt; Record New Macro.
* Excel 2007: View (tab) &gt; Macros (group) &gt; down-pointing triangle below Macros button &gt; Record Macro
* Excel 2007: Developer (tab) &gt; Code (group) &gt; Record Macro

== Making an XLA ==
* Works on: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329750/en-us|Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2], [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324126/en-us|Microsoft Excel 2000 SR-1]

An XLA is one way to make a VBA code-library. It's basically just a normal spreadsheet(.xls file) but has its worksheets hidden. Here's how to create a new one:
* New Workbook
* Save-As ...Name it whatever
* Hit Alt-F11
* In the Project-tree, select VBAProject(whatever.xls)/ThisWorkbook
* Hit F4 to get Properties View
* Find Property IsAddin and set to True
* Hit Save
* Close Excel
* Rename whatever.xls to whatever.xla

Alternatively, you can use Save As / Excel AddIn.

==Accessing the Registry==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

This recipe is for reading/writing keys local to your application -- this is to provide persistent settings for your VBA app. It does not cover arbitrary access to the Registry (i.e. looking at any key).

The VBA sub/functions are &lt;code&gt;SaveSetting&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetSetting&lt;/code&gt;. You can type the following into the Immediate window  to get a feel for how these work:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
SaveSetting &quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;, &quot;MyKeyName&quot;, &quot;Hello World&quot;
MsgBox GetSetting(&quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;, &quot;MyKeyName&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to iterate over all keys in a given section you can do so as follows:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Sub ShowAllKeys()
   Dim mySettings As Variant
   mySettings = GetAllSettings(&quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;)
   If Not IsEmpty(MySettings) Then
      Dim counter As Integer
      For counter = LBound(mySettings) To UBound(mySettings)
          Dim keyname As String: keyname = mySettings(counter, 0)
          Dim keyval As String: keyval = mySettings(counter, 1)
          MsgBox keyname &amp; &quot;=&quot; &amp; keyval
      Next
   End If
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also delete a registry key as follows:
 DeleteSetting &quot;MyApplicationName&quot;, &quot;MyConfigSection&quot;, &quot;MyKeyName&quot;

FYI: Excel/VBA sticks this in the following registry location:
 MyComputer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\MyApplicationName\MyConfigSection
...where &lt;code&gt;MyApplication&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MyConfigSection&lt;/code&gt; are whatever you specified in your &lt;code&gt;SaveSettings&lt;/code&gt; call.

They end up in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\MyApplicationName\MyConfigSection.

==Prevent Confirmation Popups In Excel==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

Make the following call from VBA:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Application.DisplayAlerts = False
&lt;/source&gt;

==Making Cells Read-Only==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Sub ProtectMe()
  Range(&quot;A1:IV65536&quot;).Locked = False
  Range(&quot;A1&quot;).Locked = True
  ActiveSheet.Protect Password:=&quot;Test&quot;
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finding Non-Empty Portion of Worksheet==
A Worksheet has a maximum size of 65536 rows by 256 columns. However if you want to iterate over all cells you probably don't want to visit all of the empty ones. For this purpose the Worksheet provides the UsedRange property. For example:
 ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count
tells you how many non-empty rows are in the given worksheet. Empty rows which are inbetween the first and last used row are counted as well. Example: If a given Worksheet has entries in cells A7 and B16, used range is considered to be A7:B16, which counts for a total of 10 rows.

==Using Events==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

Consider the following class definition -- Assume its a class called CMyClass:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Option Explicit
Dim WithEvents mySheet As Worksheet

Public Sub Init(aWS as Worksheet)
   Set MySheet = aWS
End Sub

Private Sub mySheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
   Dim MyRange As Range
   For Each MyRange in Target
      Debug.Print CStr(MyRange)
   Next
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The main ideas here are:
* By declaring mySheet WithEvents, you're saying that CMyClass is listening to mySheet's events.
* By declaring the member sub mySheet_SelectionChange you're indicating how an instance of CMyClass should react if mySheet experiences a selection change (i.e. the user selects a new cell or range of cells);  The general pattern for events is sub memberVarName_EventName(params).
* You can disconnect the eventing between the given worksheet and CMyClass by setting mySheet = nothing;
* You can create classes that throw events of your design using:
** You would declare at the top of the class: Public Event SomeNiceEventName(YourFavoriteParam1 as WhateverType, etc...), 
** You could then raise that event (i.e. firing it to whatever listeners your class has) using RaiseEvent SomeNiceEvent(&quot;Some nice event happened.&quot;);
* VBA in Excel doesn't like the letters r or c used as variables. Those letters mean 'row' and 'column' elsewhere.

A little more detail is given here: [[http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/vbanut/chapter/booklet.html#sect12]]

==Caveat: Uncaught Exceptions ==
Caveat: Uncaught exceptions in event-handlers cause VBE to mysteriously reset. If you are causing an uncaught exception in an event-handler, you probably won't get an error popup. Instead, VBE will just reset. For this reason you should make sure you're catching exceptions in all of your event handlers.

==Caveat: Online-Help Typos ==
Some versions of Excel can have typos in the F1-help. Here's an example of a Click handler with the ''correct'' parameters:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
 Private Sub clicksrc_Click(ByVal Ctrl As Office.CommandBarButton, CancelDefault As Boolean)
    MsgBox &quot;I got a click!&quot;
 End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Iterating Over MultiSelected Cells==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

The following code-snippet writes &quot;YAY!&quot; in each cell selected by the user:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For Each Cell in Selection
   Cell.Value = &quot;YAY!&quot;
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exporting VBA Code ==
* Works on Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2

The following code provides a very primitive routine to write serializes the VBA code in your modules to files:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Option Explicit
Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)
  Dim objModule As Object
  On Error Resume Next
  
  For Each objModule In ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents
    DoEvents
    If objModule.CodeModule.CountOfLines &gt; 0 Then
      objModule.Export objModule.Name &amp; &quot;.bas&quot;
    End If
  Next objModule

End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Resize a Named Range==
*Excel 2003
 
Note that the ''Resize'' property of ''Range'' objects does ''not'' change the size of the range object.  It returns a new anonymous ''Range'' object.  Easiest way to do this is to set the .Name property of the Resized range:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub ResizeRange(ByVal RangeName As String, _
                Optional NewRowCount As Long = 0, _
                Optional NewColumnCount As Long = 0)
    
  Dim oRange As Range
  Set oRange = Range(RangeName)
  If NewRowCount = 0 Then
    NewRowCount = oRange.Rows.Count
  End If
  If NewColumnCount = 0 Then
    NewColumnCount = oRange.Columns.Count
  End If
  
  oRange.Resize(NewRowCount, NewColumnCount).Name = RangeName
  
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
==Creating a Named Range==
*Excel 2002

Named Ranges allow the user to refer to a cell or range of cells by name instead of by their cell address. This name can be used in other cell formulas as well as in VBA (e.g. using the &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;''SomeName''&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;). There are two sorts of named ranges: ''Workbook Names'' and ''Worksheet Names''. 

To create a ''Workbook Name'' you can select the cell you want to name, pull down ''Insert--&gt;Name--&gt;Define...''  This will bring up the &quot;Define Name&quot; dialog. Here you can enter the new name for your cell.

The create a ''Worksheet Name'' you follow the same procedure but precede the name with ''Sheetname''&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Sheet1!InitialValue&lt;/code&gt; to create a named-range only visible from within worksheet &lt;code&gt;Sheet1&lt;/code&gt;.

When there are two variables with the same name, one local (''Worksheet Name'') and one global (''Workbook Name''), the spreadsheet uses the local variable.

There is no way to ''visualize'' a named range. The closest thing is to pull down again ''Insert--&gt;Name--&gt;Define...'', but this method does not show if a variable is a local ''Worksheet Name'' or a global ''Workbook Name''.

The named range can be a single cell, part of a row, part of a column or a rectangular group of cells. Each one behaves differently:
* A single cell can be referenced anywhere in the worksheet or, if it's defined globally (''workbook name''), anywhere in any worksheet.
* A group of cells composing part of a row can only be referenced in a parallel row. For example, if the named variable is ''mass'' and it spans the cells C5:L5, then a reference to ''mass' at cell E8 (say, a formula like ''=mass * (3e8)^2'') would take the value at C8, but a reference to ''mass'' at cell M9 would return an error
* Similarly, a group of cells composing part of a column can only be referenced in a parallel column. Cells outside the range will return an error
* A group of cells that define a rectangular array of sides greater than one is only useful to be referenced in other worksheets - so, there's no point in defining them locally (''worksheet name''). For example, if ''covmatrix'' are the cells ''Sheet1!B2:D4'', then if cell ''Sheet2!C3'' has the formula ''=1/sqrt(covmatrix)'', then it will return ''1/sqrt(Sheet1!C3)''.

==Reading a File==
Reading a file line by line AKA for each line of a file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  MyFileName = &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\File.txt&quot;
  FileNo = FreeFile()
  Open MyFileName For Input As #FileNo
  While Not EOF(FileNo)
    Line Input #FileNo, MyLine
    MsgBox MyLine
  Wend
  Close #FileNo
&lt;/source&gt;

==Writing to a File==
Writing to a file:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
  MyFileName = &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\File.txt&quot;
  FileNo = FreeFile()
  Open MyFileName For Output As #FileNo
  For I = 1 To 10
    Print #FileNo, Str(I);
    ' The semicolon above prevents printing of a newline
  Next
  Close #FileNo
&lt;/source&gt;

  FileNo = FreeFile()
  Open MyFileName For Output As #FileNo
  RowCount = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells.Rows.Count
  ColumnCount = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells.Columns.Count
  For RowNo = 1 To RowCount
    For ColNo = 1 To ColumnCount
      Print #FileNo, Cells(RowNo, ColNo); ' The semicolon bars newline printing
      If ColNo &lt; ColumnCount Then
        Print #FileNo, vbTab;
      End If
    Next
    If RowNo &lt; RowCount Then
      Print #FileNo, vbNewline;
    End If

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If Dir(MyFileName) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; Then
    MsgBox &quot;The file exists.&quot;
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Directories==
Making a directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  MkDir &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\TestFolder&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Removing a directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  RmDir &quot;C:\Users\Joe\Desktop\TestFolder&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Changing to a directory:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ChDir &quot;C:\Users&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Changing the current drive:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ChDrive &quot;C:&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Listing the content of a directory, using a custom filter encompassing two file extensions:

==Grep==
Searching for a regular expression in the lines of the files of a directory aka grepping:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Directory = &quot;C:\Users\Joe Hoe\&quot;
PatternString = &quot;target.*path&quot;
  
MyFile = Dir(Directory)
Set Lines = New Collection
Set RegExp = CreateObject(&quot;VBScript.RegExp&quot;)
RegExp.Pattern = PatternString
RegExp.IgnoreCase = True
While MyFile &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
  Extension = LCase(Right(MyFile, 4))
  If Extension = &quot;.txt&quot; Or Extension = &quot;.bat&quot; Then
    MyFullFileName = Directory &amp; MyFile
    FileNo = FreeFile()
    Open MyFullFileName For Input As #FileNo
    While Not EOF(FileNo)
      Line Input #FileNo, MyLine
      If RegExp.Test(MyLine) Then
        Lines.Add MyLine
      End If
    Wend
    Close #FileNo
  End If
  MyFile = Dir() 'Next file or folder
Wend
'Lines is a collection of the matching lines
&lt;/source&gt;

==Clipboard==
Prerequisites: Accessing the clipboard from an Excel sheet requires that a reference to MSForms (Microsoft Forms Object Library) is set in the sheet. You can set the reference by adding and subsequent removing of a user form, via Insert &gt; UserForm in a pop-up menu. To check the presence of a reference, see Tools &gt; References menu.

Placing text on the clipboard:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyClipboard = New MSForms.DataObject
MyClipboard.SetText &quot;My string&quot;
MyClipboard.PutInClipboard
&lt;/source&gt;

Getting text from the clipboard:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyClipboard = New MSForms.DataObject
MyClipboard.GetFromClipboard
TextContent = MyClipboard.GetText
&lt;/source&gt;

Links:
* [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.dataobject.aspx DataObject Class] at msdn.microsoft.com; contains a section on Visual Basic, whose applicability to Excel VBA is unclear

==Range==
A range is a set of cells. The cells in a range do not need to be adjacent. However, the cells in a single range do need to belong to a single worksheet.

Defining a new range:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Selection 'The current selection, possibly of multiple cells
Set MyRange = ActiveCell 'The single active cell
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 2) 'Row=1, Column=2 AKA B
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 1).Offset(0, 1) '=Cells(1, 2)
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 2).Offset(0, -1) '=Cells(1, 1)
Set MyRange = Cells(1, 1).Offset(0, -1) 'An error
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;A1:C2&quot;) 'Letters indicate columns; numbers indicate rows
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;A1:A3,C1:C3&quot;) 'A discontinuous range
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:C2&quot;).Cells(1, 1) '=Cells(2, 2) =Range(&quot;B2&quot;)
Set MyRange = Rows(1) 'An entire row
Set MyRange = Columns(1) 'An entire column
Set MyRange = Cells(2,2).EntireRow
Set MyRange = Cells(2,2).EntireColumn
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B1:C1&quot;).EntireColumn 'Two entire columns
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlUp) '=Cells(1, 2) =Range(&quot;B1&quot;)
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlToLeft) '=Cells(2, 1) = Range(&quot;A2&quot;)
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlDown) '=Cells(&lt;last row number&gt;, 2)
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;).End(xlToRight) '=Cells(2, &lt;last column number&gt;)

&lt;/source&gt;

Iterating a range AKA for each cell in a range:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Selection
For Each Cell in MyRange
  MsgBox Cell
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Iterating rows and iterating columns AKA for each row of a range and for each column of a range, even if discontiguous:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set Rng = Range(&quot;A1:B1,D3:E3&quot;) 'Discontiguous range
For Each Row In Rng.Rows
  RowNo = Row.Row
Next
For Each Column In Rng.Columns
  ColNo = Column.Column
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Making an union (a range subsuming both) or intersection (a range covering only cells in common) of two ranges:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Range(&quot;A1:C2&quot;)
Set MyRange = Union(MyRange, Range(&quot;A5:C5&quot;))
MyRange.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 0)
Set MyRange = Intersect(MyRange, Columns(2))
MyRange.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 100, 0)
&lt;/source&gt;

Selecting a range:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyRange = Sheets(1).Range(&quot;A1:B1,D1:E1&quot;)
MyRange.Select 'Even a discontinuous range can be selected
&lt;/source&gt;

Activating a cell:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Range(&quot;A1:B2&quot;).Select 'Affects Selection, generally of multiple cells
Range(&quot;A2&quot;).Activate 'Affects ActiveCell, the single one
&lt;/source&gt;

Finding out about a range AKA learning about a range, including the number of cells AKA cell count, the first row, the last row, the first column, the last column, row count, and column count:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set Rng = Range(&quot;B2:D4&quot;) 'Contiguous range
NumberOfCells = Rng.Cells.Count
FirstRowNo = Rng.Row
LastRowNo = Rng.Row + Rng.Rows.Count - 1 'Only for contiguous ranges
FirstColNo = Rng.Column
LastColNo = Rng.Column + Rng.Columns.Count - 1 'Only for contiguous ranges

Set Rng = Range(&quot;A1:B1,D1:E1&quot;) 'Discontiguous range
BrokenLastColNo = Rng.Column + Rng.Columns.Count - 1 'Only for contiguous ranges
'Do it the correct way for discontiguous range
LastColNo = 0
For Each Cell in Rng
  If Cell.Column &gt; LastColNo then
    LastColNo = Cell.Column
  End If
Next

Set RangeWorksheet = Rng.Worksheet
&lt;/source&gt;

==Worksheet==
To create, access, or delete worksheets, you can use the  methods of Worksheet objects. Examples follow.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Set MyNewWorksheet = Sheets.Add 'Create
Set MyNewWorksheet2 = Sheets.Add(After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)) 'Create and place as the last sheet
MyNewWorksheet.Name = &quot;My Sheet&quot;
Set IndexedWorksheet = Sheets(1) 'Access by index
Set NamedWorksheet = Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;) 'Access by name
Set NamedWorksheet2 = Worksheets(&quot;Name&quot;) 'Does the same thing as the line above
MyNewWorksheet.Delete
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Cells(1,1) = &quot;New Value&quot; 'Access the cells of the worksheet
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Cells.Clear 'Clear an entire worksheet, including formatting and cell values
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Columns(1).Sort key1:=Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Range(&quot;A1&quot;) 'Sort the first column
Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Columns(1).Sort key1:=Sheets(&quot;Name&quot;).Range(&quot;A1&quot;), _
  order1:=xlDescending, header:=xlYes 'Use descending instead of ascending; do not sort
                                      ' the first cell, considering it a header
MyNewWorksheet2.Visible = xlSheetHidden
MyNewWorksheet2.Visible = xlSheetVisible
&lt;/source&gt;

Obtaining an existing sheet by name or creating it if it does not exist:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
NewSheetName = &quot;My Sheet&quot;
Set MySheet = Nothing
On Error Resume Next
Set MySheet = Sheets(NewSheetName)
On Error GoTo 0
If MySheet Is Nothing Then
  Set MySheet = Sheets.Add(After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count))
  MySheet.Name = NewSheetName
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Searching==
You can search for values in a sheet as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim SoughtString As String
SoughtString = &quot;London&quot;
Set ForeignKeySheet = Sheets(&quot;CitySize&quot;)
Set FoundCell = ForeignKeySheet.Columns(1).Find(SoughtString, LookAt:=xlWhole)
If Not FoundCell Is Nothing Then
  'The value associated with the key is in column 2
  CitySize = FoundCell.Offset(0, 1)
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to have a substring match, drop &quot;LookAt:=xlWhole&quot; or use &quot;LookAt:=xlPart&quot;.

==Cell Formatting==
You can format cells including text color, background color, font properties and border, but also formatting as a number, percent or text from VBA as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Selection.Characters.Font.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 'Foreground color AKA text color
  Selection.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 230) 'Background color
  Selection.Characters.Font.ColorIndex = xlAutomatic 'Reset foreground color
  Selection.Interior.Color = xlAutomatic 'Reset background color
  Selection.Font.Name = &quot;Verdana&quot; 'Font face
  Selection.Font.Size = 8 'Font size
  Selection.Font.Bold = True
  Selection.Font.Italic = True
  Selection.Font.Underline = True
  'Selection.Font.Strikethrough = True
  Selection.Font.Name = Application.StandardFont 'See also ClearFormats below
  Selection.Font.Size = Application.StandardFontSize 'See also ClearFormats below
  'Selection.Borders.LineStyle = xlLineStyleNone or xlDouble or xlDashDotDot or other
  Selection.Borders.Weight = xlMedium ' xlHairline, xlThin, xlMedium, or xlThick
  'Selection.Borders(xlEdgeBottom).Weight = xlThick
  ' LineStyle and Weight interact in strange ways.
  Selection.Borders.Color = RGB(127, 127, 0) 'Will be overridden below; applies to all borders
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeBottom).Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeTop).Color = RGB(0, 255, 0)
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeLeft).Color = RGB(0, 0, 255)
  Selection.Borders(xlEdgeRight).Color = RGB(0, 127, 127)
  Selection.Borders(xlInsideHorizontal).Color = &amp;H7FFF00 'A tricky hex matching RGB(0, 255, 127)
  Selection.Borders(xlInsideVertical).Color = RGB(255, 127, 0)

  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;General&quot;
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;00&quot; 'As a number with zero decimal places, showing at least two digits
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;0.000&quot; 'As a number, showing three decimal places and no more
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;0.0%&quot; 'As a percent with one decimal place
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;@&quot; 'As text
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;0.00E+00&quot; 'As a number in scientific notation,
                                      'the string before E formatting the significand
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;m/d/yyyy&quot; 'As a date; whether &quot;/&quot; is shown depends on locale
  Selection.NumberFormat = &quot;d. mmmm yyyy hh:mm:ss&quot; 'As date, showing the month using a word,
                                      'also showing time
                                        
  Selection.ClearFormats 'Remove formatting, keeping cell content.
                         'Removes also the formatting set using NumberFormat.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Color==
In Excel VBA, RGB colors are plain numbers rather than objects. Some color examples are listed in [[#Cell Formatting]].

Some examples:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Selection.Characters.Font.Color = RGB(0, 0, 255) 'Foreground color AKA text color
Selection.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 230) 'Background color
Selection.Characters.Font.ColorIndex = xlAutomatic 'Reset foreground color
Selection.Comment.Shape.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(220, 255, 160)
'The above is the fill color, that is, the background color
Selection.Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font.ColorIndex = 3 'Red per default
'Selection.Comment.Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Font.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0) 'Does not work in Excel 2007
If False Then
  ActiveWorkbook.Colors(3) = RGB(200, 0, 0) 'Make the red in the index 5 a bit darker
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Setting the background color of the cells of the 1st column to the row number color index:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
For ColorIndex = 1 to 56
  Cells(ColorIndex,1).Interior.ColorIndex = ColorIndex 
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Color index in the default palette:
* 0 - Automatic
* 1 - Black
* 2 - White
* 3 - Red
* 4 - Green
* 5 - Blue
* 6 - Yellow
* 7 - Magenta
* 8 - Cyan
* 9 - Dark red
* 10 - Dark green
* 11 - Dark blue
* ... etc., through 56

Finding all cells whose text color approaches green:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
  TargetColor = RGB(0, 255, 0)
  Tolerance = 200
  'Extract the color components. The extraction is unneeded, but if the target
  'color came from the color of a selected cell, it would be needed.
  TmpColor = TargetColor
  TargetColorRed = TmpColor Mod 256
  TmpColor = TmpColor \ 256
  TargetColorGreen = TmpColor Mod 256
  TmpColor = TmpColor \ 256
  TargetColorBlue = TmpColor Mod 256

  For Each Cell In ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Cells
    MyColor = Cell.Characters.Font.Color 'Color is a number
    'Extract the RGB components of the color
    Red = MyColor Mod 256
    MyColor = MyColor \ 256
    Green = MyColor Mod 256
    MyColor = MyColor \ 256
    Blue = MyColor Mod 256
    'Find the distance from the target color
    Distance = ((Red - TargetColorRed) ^ 2 + _
                (Green - TargetColorGreen) ^ 2 + _
                (Blue - TargetColorBlue) ^ 2) ^ 0.5
    If Distance &lt; Tolerance Then
      Cell.Interior.Color = RGB(230, 230, 230) 'Mark the cell using its background color
    End If
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Visibility==
Hiding a '''row''' (hide a row, hide row):
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Rows(2).Hidden = True
'Rows(2).Hidden = False 'Show it again
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding several rows at once:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Range(&quot;A1:A3&quot;).EntireRow.Hidden = True 'Hide rows 1, 2, and 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding the rows of the currently selected cells:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Selection.EntireRow.Hidden = True
&lt;/source&gt;

Looping over rows that are visible AKA shown AKA not hidden:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For RowNo = 1 To 10
  If Not Rows(RowNo).Hidden Then
    'Do something on the row
  End If
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Toggling the visibility of rows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For RowNo = 1 To 10
  If Not Rows(RowNo).Hidden Then
    Rows(RowNo).Hidden = True
  Else
    Rows(RowNo).Hidden = False
  End If
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding a '''column''' (hide a column, hide column):
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Columns(2).Hidden = True
'Columns(2).Hidden = False 'Show it again
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding several columns at once:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Range(&quot;A1:C1&quot;).EntireColumn.Hidden = True 'Hide columns 1, 2, and 3
&lt;/source&gt;

Hiding the columns of the currently selected cells:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Selection.EntireColumn.Hidden = True
&lt;/source&gt;

Other tricks pertaining to visibility of columns work in a direct analogy to the examples for rows above.

==Hyperlink==
Opening or following a hyperlink (open a hyperlink, follow a hyperlink, open hyperlink, follow hyperlink):

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;http://www.microsoft.com&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening the Wikipedia article for the article title found in the single active cell by opening a put-together URL:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot; &amp; ActiveCell
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening a Wikipedia article per article title in any of the currently selected cells:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
For Each Cell In Selection
  ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&quot; &amp; Cell
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

Opening a local hyperlink, with a possible pop-up asking for confirmation for security reasons:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
ActiveWorkbook.FollowHyperlink &quot;file://C:\Users\Joe Hoe\Desktop\Test.txt&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Temporary file==
Getting a temporary file, with unclear robustness of the following method, which uses random numbers and tests for file existence:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Function GetTempFile(Prefix As String, Suffix As String) As String
  TempFolder = Environ$(&quot;tmp&quot;)
  Randomize
  While True
    TempFileName = TempFolder &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; Prefix &amp; CStr(Int(10000000 * Rnd)) &amp; Suffix
    If Dir(TempFileName) = &quot;&quot; Then 'Then the file does not exist
      GetTempFile = TempFileName
      Exit Function
    End If
  Wend
End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

==Command Output==
If you do not mind a popping up console window, here is a way of obtaining output of a command from Excel VBA:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyShell = CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)
Set ExecObject = MyShell.Exec(&quot;tasklist /v&quot;)
' AllText = ExecObject.StdOut.ReadAll
Do While Not ExecObject.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  Line = ExecObject.StdOut.ReadLine()
  If InStr(Line, &quot;AcroRd32.exe&quot;) &gt; 0 Then
    'Do something
  End If
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

If having a console window popping up is not acceptable and you are okay with creating a temporary file, here is another way of obtaining output of a command from Excel VBA:

&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
'Summary: Run &quot;attrib&quot; on the file in column A (1) of the row
'of the currently selected cell, writing the result into
'column B (2) of the row.

'Get temp file name
TempFolder = Environ$(&quot;tmp&quot;)
Randomize
TempFileName = &quot;&quot;
While TempFileName = &quot;&quot;
  TempFileNameCand = TempFolder &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; &quot;mytmp&quot; &amp; CStr(Int(10000000 * Rnd)) &amp; &quot;.tmp&quot;
  If Dir(TempFileNameCand) = &quot;&quot; Then 'Then the file does not exist
    TempFileName = TempFileNameCand
  End If
Wend
 
'Run the command
Set MyShell = CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)
MyCommand = &quot;cmd /c attrib &quot;&quot;&quot; &amp; Cells(Selection.Row, 1) &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot; &gt;&quot; &amp; TempFileName
MyShell.Run MyCommand, 0, True '0 = show no window
'Although attrib has an exe file, we need to use &quot;cmd&quot; for the
'redirection to work.

FileNo = FreeFile()
Open TempFileName For Input As #FileNo
While Not EOF(FileNo)
  Line Input #FileNo, MyLine
  Cells(Selection.Row, 2) = MyLine
Wend
Close #FileNo
Kill TempFileName 'Delete the file to clean up, although not strictly necessary
&lt;/source&gt;

Using cmd /c, you can run chains of commands connected using &amp; or | as well:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyShell = CreateObject(&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;)
Set ExecObject = MyShell.Exec(&quot;cmd /c cd /d C:\Users\Joe Hoe &amp; findstr /s knowledge *.txt&quot;)
' AllText = ExecObject.StdOut.ReadAll
Do While Not ExecObject.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  Line = ExecObject.StdOut.ReadLine()
  'Do something
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

== Add-Ins at Startup ==

Controlling what add-ins Excel opens at startup:

'''Microsoft Excel 2003:''' Configure loaded add-ins via Tools -&gt; Add-ins. Their list is mirrored in the following Registry key, but there's no advantage in editing the Registry:
 HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Init Commands

'''Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2:'''When you start Excel, it may automatically load addins (i.e. those you added from Tools -&gt; Add-Ins). The list of add-ins that get loaded come from the following registry key:
 HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Excel\Options
Under this key you may find a list of string-variables:
* OPEN
* OPEN1
* OPEN2
* etc...
The values of these variables is the name of the add-in. Excel, on start-up, will attempt to load the add-in in string-variable OPEN first, then OPEN1 (if present), onward until it runs out of such string-variables. It seems like Excel will automatically renumber the keys if they are not consecutive (i.e. OPEN1, OPEN3, OPEN4 will become OPEN1, OPEN2, OPEN3).

Note also the list of add-ins presented when you do Tools -&gt; Add-Ons is, in part, populated by the contents of the following key:
 HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Excel\Addin Manager

See also the following MS KB article: [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/161439/EN-US/ How to Remove Entries from Add-Ins Dialog Box].

==Chart direct from VBA array data==
Charts need not be based on the values in cells of a spreadsheet, but can also be made directly in VBA from an array.  The following code makes a chart of the relative frequency of characters in a string, in percent of the total, or normalized to a maximum of unity. There is also an option to sort the display and the content can be changed by modifying the content or sequence of the vRef array.   Procedures to remove charts and test the functions are included.   
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;

Sub TestChartOfStrFreq()
    'run this to make a chart
    
    Dim str As String, n As Long, c As Long
    
    'place user string here
    str = &quot;&quot;
    
    'if no user string use these random charas
    If str = &quot;&quot; Then
        Do
           DoEvents
           Randomize
           n = Int((127 - 0 + 1) * Rnd + 0)
            Select Case n
            'numbers, and upper and lower letters
            Case 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
               str = str &amp; Chr(n)
               c = c + 1
            End Select
        Loop Until c = 1000

== Nuking Retained State ==
* Works on: Microsoft Excel 2002 SP-2
* OS: Windows XP

Nuking Excel's Retained State: Excel remembers all sorts of things between runs: What addins to load, what buttons and menus to display, etc. Sometime you'll want to clean all of this stuff up and bring Excel back to its factory state.

Nuking Excel Checklist:
#Make sure the following directories are empty:
##C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office10\xlstart
##C:\apps\xp\application data\Microsoft\xlstart
#Nuke the auto-open keys from the registry(as shown below);
#Nuke all .xlbs – For example check here:
##C:\apps\xp\application data\Microsoft\Excel

'''Chili powder''' is a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]], made from assorted chiles (like anchos and arbol chiles). It is generally a red or green powder, and used often in chili con carne, the stew involving meat, tomato products, sometimes beans, and assorted chiles. It is similar to [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]].

==Ingredients==

*6 ancho chiles, stemmed and finely chopped
*3 dried arbol chiles, stemmed and finely chopped
*2 tbs garlic powder
*1 tbs dried oregano
*2 tbs whole toasted cumin

==Procedure==
#Give everything a run in a blender, food processor, or spice grinder until it's a fine powder.

[[Image:ToastedWhiteBread.jpg|right|180px|thumb|American Toast.]]

'''Toast''' is sliced [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] which has been browned, to varying degrees, on each side by exposure to radiated heat. Historically, the bread was placed on a wire toasting fork and held before the red hot charcoal or embers of an open fire, and toasted one side at a time. It can be made by placing the bread slices under a hot grill or  broiler, and turning when one side of the bread is browned to taste. Nowadays, in most western countries, toast is usually made in an electric toaster which browns both sides of the bread simultaneously. Most toasters have a timing mechanism to control the degree of browning and &quot;pop up&quot; the bread slices when the toasting is complete. Toast often accompanies [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] foods, particularly [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]] and [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]. 

Toast can be eaten with a topping of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] and a classic combination of toppings is [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] with [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] sprinkled on top. The recipe uses about &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of sugar and 1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of cinnamon for each slice of bread. The butter is well-spread and melted first, so that the cinnamon and sugar will stick to the toast. 

==Ingredients==
*One or more slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], sized to fit your [[Cookbook:Toaster|toaster]]
*Topping (optional)

==Procedure==
[[Image:Toaster.jpg|thumb|right|A Toaster]]

#Ensure that the [[Cookbook:Toaster|toaster]] is plugged in, generally clean, and functional.
#Place some bread slices into the toaster. Usually, you must place each slice into a separate slot. Some toasters can hold two slices in an extra-wide slot. If you use a [[Cookbook:Toaster Oven|toaster oven]], you may need to lay the bread slices flat on a metal grill inside the toaster oven.
#If the toaster has a darkness control, adjust it as desired.
#Activate the toaster.
#Watch the bread as it browns. If it starts to get excessively dark, activate the pop up mechanism and carefully remove the toast. If you are unable to make the toast pop out, unplug the toaster. Do not reach into a slotted toaster, whether with your hand or a metal tool, while it is plugged in or very hot.
#Spread your choice of topping on the toast with a [[Cookbook:Knife|knife]], [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]], or [[Cookbook:Spoon|spoon]].

==Toppings==
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*[[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*[[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]
*[[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]
*[[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*[[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*[[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]

==Variations==
*The bread crust can be cut off after the toast has been cooked. The topping can be added to both sides.
*Replace ordinary bread slices with a [[Cookbook:Bagel|bagel]] or [[Cookbook:English Muffin|English muffin]] cut across the axis.
*Butter would be the best topping choice when using  [[Cookbook:Raisin Bread|raisin bread]] to make toast.
*Replace each slice of bread with a [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffle]] or [[Cookbook:Scone|scone]].

'''Jelly''' is filtered and solidified [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] syrup.

The fruit is crushed or pureed, then boiled to reduce the amount of water. Depending on the type of fruit, additional [[Cookbook:Pectin|pectin]] or [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] may need to be added. If there is not enough pectin, the jelly will not solidify. At some point while the jelly is still liquid, it is filtered or strained to remove any seeds or skins.

'''Cranberry sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] or a [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] made by cooking cranberries, sugar, and often other ingredients together. Many, if not most, Americans are more familiar with the canned cranberry sauce which is a clear, solidified, jelly that is often valued for the property of maintaining the shape of the can in which it is packaged.

The fruit will generally come apart when vigorously [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], so there is no need to crush or puree it when a jam-style cranberry sauce is desired. Cranberry sauce can be made from cranberries and sugar alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Do Some Research==
Is that demo looking tempting enough to download? Or how about that brand new piece of hardware? Well before you do, perhaps you should do some research on it first. By doing your research you can avoid future potential problems by at least being aware of bugs, compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and undesirable inclusions like spyware &amp; adware. 

'''You can research:'''
* Reviews &amp; Ratings
* Frequently Asked Questions
* Release Notes
* Press Releases
* Version History
* System Requirements

==Update Everything==
Applications, operating systems, drivers... Nearly everything on your PC can be updated. Updates are often released to remove bugs, fix exploits, improve compatibility, optimize performance, add features, refresh databases, and enhance experiemce.

However you should be aware that some updates are purely optional and may be require certain conditions to be applicable, especially firmware updates.

While you should avoid interrupting software updates, you should never interrupt a firmware update.

'''You should update your:'''
* Anti-Virus
* Anti-Spyware / Anti-Adware
* Personal Firewall
* Operating System
* Internet Browsers
* Communications Software (E-Mail, IM, and Chat Clients)
* Productivity Suites
* Favorite Applications
* Device Drivers
* Firmware

'''You should run:'''
* Anti-Virus scans
* Disk - defragmentation tool
* Disk Cleanup wizard

A useful tutorial on a sequence for managing your computer's health is available at [http://seniornetwgtn.blogspot.com/] under the '''WORKSHOP NOTES''' heading ''Clean your PC''

==Keep your passwords safe==
Your passwords protect your files, your user accounts, and your online accounts, so don't you think you should protect your password?

'''General Guidelines:'''
* Avoid using personal data as passwords--you shouldn't use your birthday, your national insurance/social security number, or proper names as passwords.
* Include capital letters, numbers, and symbols.
* If you can, avoid using any word in the dictionary in your password, or any proper names. Crackers (criminal hackers) have lists of nearly all words in English, as well as other languages, and by using a special program, can test thousands of words per second against your password. Ideally, a password should be at least 8 characters (letters/numbers) long, and contain letters and numbers interspersed  throughout its length; for example &quot;9hyl8rn25g&quot;; do not use this example as your password! 
* Use multiple passwords.
* In general, don't EVER give your password to others, even other family members. There are normally ways they can obtain their own user accounts and passwords. Any person who knows a secret doubles the likelihood that secret will be revealed, at the very least.
* If someone you don't personally know asks you for your password, including individuals from the &quot;phone company&quot;, the &quot;cable company&quot;, the &quot;ISP&quot;, the &quot;bank&quot;, the &quot;police&quot;, the &quot;government&quot;, from &quot;corporate&quot;, from &quot;IT&quot; or &quot;MIS&quot;, or any individual purporting to hold a position of authority, generally assume that the request is malicious in nature, unless:
1. They ask you in person--not by phone, by email, or instant messenger;
2. You ask for and they show a tamper-proof photo identification card--merely wearing a uniform is insufficient;
3. You call where they came from, verify that they are actually who they say they are, and verify that in their job, they normally ask people for their passwords.
* Verify where you enter your password, especially on the Web. There are fake sites that look like real ones which are designed to trick you into giving out your password.
* When in doubt, change your password.

'''Keep the system free from all junk files:'''

* Remove all the files in the Temp Folder, Temporary Internet files Folder, History Folder and the recent document Folder. you can do this by doing the Disk Cleanup.

== Why were the pages on Set Theory moved to Topology? ==

I am wondering why these pages on Set Theory were moved under Topology.  Since Set Theory underlies many parts of mathematics (e.g. Discrete Mathematics as well), shouldn't a book on Set Theory stand on its own, with some less-thorough reference to Set Theory given in the books on Topology, Discrete Math, etc.?

I agree whole-heartedly.  If there is no objection in, say, a month, I will declare a consensus and move the restore this to being its own book.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:48, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

Ditto, merging with what's in Discrete Mathematics would be appreciated also.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 04:05, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

After many months of no objections, I hereby declare a consensus and have restored Set Theory as its own book. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:13, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

== Wikiversity navbar ==

The Set Theory pages have a &lt;nowiki&gt;nav3&lt;/nowiki&gt; template creating backlinks to [[Wikiversity:School of Mathematics]] and their [[School of Mathematics:Pure Mathematics]].  However, this book was not created as part of Wikiveristy.  [[School of Mathematics:Pure Mathematics]] lists several &quot;Structured courses&quot;; each of these have this &lt;nowiki&gt;nav3&lt;/nowiki&gt; template with similar backlinks.  [[School of Mathematics:Pure Mathematics]] also lists several &quot;Texts for reference&quot;.  The idea, so it seems, is that these are books outside Wikiversity offering related material.  Of these only Set Theory has the backlinks to Wikiversity.  I would like to remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;nav3&lt;/nowiki&gt; template from the Set Theory pages.  If there is no objection after about a month, I will declare a consensus and remove it.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:30, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

Bayesian analysis is the branch of statistics based on the idea that we have some knowledge in advance about the probabilities that we are interested in, so called ''a priori'' probabilities. This might be your degree of belief in a particular event, the results from previous studies, or a general agreed-upon starting value for a probability. The terminology &quot;Bayesian&quot; comes from the Bayesian rule or law, a law about conditional probabilities. The opposite of &quot;Bayesian&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;Classical Statistics.&quot;

===Example===
Consider a box with 3 coins, with probabilities of showing heads respectively 1/4,  1/2 and 3/4. We choose arbitrarily one of the coins. Hence we take 1/3 as the a priori probability &lt;math&gt;P(C_1)&lt;/math&gt; of having chosen coin number 1. After 5 throws, in which X=4 times heads came up, it seems less likely that the coin is coin number 1. We calculate the a posteriori probability  that the coin is coin number 1, as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P(C_1|X=4)&amp;=\frac{P(X=4|C_1)P(C_1)}{P(X=4)}\\
&amp;=\frac{P(X=4|C_1)P(C_1)}{P(X=4|C_1)P(C_1)+P(X=4|C_2)P(C_2)+P(X=4|C_3)P(C_3)}\\
&amp;=\frac{ {5 \choose 4} (\frac 14)^4 \frac 34 \frac 13}
{{5 \choose 4} (\frac 14)^4 \frac 34 \frac 13+{5 \choose 4} (\frac 12)^4 \frac 12 \frac 13+{5 \choose 4} (\frac 34)^4 \frac 14 \frac 13}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In words:
: The probability that the Coin is the first Coin, given that we know heads came up 4 times... Is equal to the probability that heads came up 4 times given we know it's the first coin, times the probability that the coin is the first coin. All divided by the probability that heads comes up 4 times (ignoring which of the three Coins is chosen). The binomial coefficients cancel out as well as all denominators when expanding 1/2 to 2/4. This results in
::&lt;math&gt;
\frac{3}{3 + 32 + 81}=\frac{3}{116}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the same way we find:
:&lt;math&gt;P(C_2|X=4)=\frac{32}{3 + 32 + 81}=\frac{32}{116}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;P(C_3|X=4)=\frac{81}{3 + 32 + 81}=\frac{81}{116}&lt;/math&gt;.

This shows us that after examining the outcome of the five throws, it is most likely we did choose coin number 3.

Actually for a given result the denominator does not matter, only the relative Probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(C_i) = P(C_i|X=4)/P(X=4)&lt;/math&gt;
When the result is 3 times heads the Probabilities change in favor of Coin 2 and further as the following table shows:

Preprocessors are a way of making text processing with your C program before they are actually compiled. Before the actual compilation of every C program it is passed through a Preprocessor. The Preprocessor looks through the program trying to find out specific instructions called Preprocessor directives that it can understand. All Preprocessor directives begin with the # (hash) symbol.
C++ compilers use the same C preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Understanding C++/C Preprocessor]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[w:Preprocessor|preprocessor]] is a part of the compiler which performs preliminary operations (conditionally compiling code, including  files etc...) to your code before the compiler sees it.  These transformations are lexical, meaning that the output of the preprocessor is still text. 

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE: Technically the output of the preprocessing phase for C consists of a sequence of tokens, rather than source text, but it is simple to output source text which is equivalent to the given token sequence, and that is commonly supported by compilers via a &lt;tt&gt;-E&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/E&lt;/tt&gt; option -- although command line options to C compilers aren't completely standard, many follow similar rules.
|}

==Directives==
Directives are special instructions directed to the preprocessor (preprocessor directive) or to the [[w:compiler|compiler]] (compiler directive) on how it should process part or all of your source code or set some flags on the final object and are used to make writing source code easier (more portable for instance) and to make the source code more understandable. Directives are handled by the preprocessor, which is either a separate program invoked by the compiler or part of the compiler itself.

===#include===
C has some features as part of the language and some others as part of a '''standard library''', which is a repository of code that is available alongside every standard-conformant C compiler. When the C compiler compiles your program it usually also links it with the standard C library. For example, on encountering a &lt;code&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; directive, it replaces the directive with the contents of the &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; header file.

When you use features from the library, C requires you to ''declare'' what you would be using. The first line in the program is a '''preprocessing directive''' which should look like this:

 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

The above line causes the C declarations which are in the &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; [[w:Header file|header]] to be included for use in your program. Usually this is implemented by just inserting into your program the contents of a '''header file''' called &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt;, located in a system-dependent location. The location of such files may be described in your compiler's documentation. A list of standard C header files is listed below in the Headers table.

The &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; header contains various declarations for input/output (I/O) using an abstraction of I/O mechanisms called '''streams'''. For example there is an output stream object called &lt;tt&gt;stdout&lt;/tt&gt; which is used to output text to the standard output, which usually displays the text on the computer screen.

If using angle brackets like the example above, the preprocessor is instructed to search for the include file along the development environment path for the standard includes.

 #include &quot;other.h&quot;

If you use  quotation marks (&lt;tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;), the preprocessor is expected to search in some additional, usually user-defined, locations for the header file, and to fall back to the standard include paths only if it is not found in those additional locations.  It is common for this form to include searching in the same directory as the file containing the &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; directive.

| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE: You should check the documentation of the development environment you are using for any vendor specific implementations of the &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; directive.

* &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Wctype.h|&lt;wctype.h&gt;]]&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===#pragma===
The '''pragma''' (pragmatic information) directive is part of the standard, but the meaning of any pragma depends on the software implementation of the standard that is used. The #pragma directive provides a way to request special behavior from the compiler. This directive is most useful for programs that are unusually large or that need to take advantage of the capabilities of a particular compiler. 

Pragmas are used within the source program.

 #pragma token(s)

#pragma is usually followed by a single token, which represents a command for the compiler to obey. You should check the software implementation of the C standard you intend on using for a list of the supported tokens. Not surprisingly, the set of commands that can appear in #pragma directives is different for each compiler; you'll have to consult the documentation for your compiler to see which commands it allows and what those commands do. 

For instance one of the most implemented preprocessor directives, &lt;code&gt;#pragma once&lt;/code&gt; when placed at the beginning of a header file, indicates that the file where it resides will be skipped if included several times by the preprocessor.

NOTE: Other methods exist to do this action that is commonly referred as using '''include guards'''.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

===&lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt;===

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fff2f2; border: solid 1px #ffbfbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
WARNING: Preprocessor macros, although tempting, can produce quite unexpected results if not done right. Always keep in mind that macros are textual substitutions done to your source code before anything is compiled. The compiler does not know anything about the macros and never gets to see them. This can produce obscure errors, amongst other negative effects. Prefer to use language features, if there are equivalent (In example use &lt;code&gt;const int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;d constants).

That said, there are cases, where macros are very useful (see the &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt; macro below for an example).    
|}

The &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; directive is used to define values or macros that are used by the preprocessor to manipulate the program source code before it is compiled.  Because preprocessor definitions are substituted before the compiler acts on the source code, any errors that are introduced by &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; are difficult to trace.  

By convention, values defined using &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; are named in uppercase.  Although doing so is not a requirement, it is considered very bad practice to do otherwise.  This allows the values to be easily identified when reading the source code.

Today, &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; is primarily used to handle compiler and platform differences. E.g., a define might hold a constant which is the appropriate error code for a system call.  The use of &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; should thus be limited unless absolutely necessary; &lt;tt&gt;typedef&lt;/tt&gt; statements and constant variables can often perform the same functions more safely.  

Another feature of the &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; command is that it can take arguments, making it rather useful as a pseudo-function creator. Consider the following code: 

 #define ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ( ((x) &lt; 0) ? -(x) : (x) )
 ...
 int x = -1;
 while( ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ) {
 ...
 }
		
It's generally a good idea to use extra parentheses when using complex macros. Notice that in the above example, the variable &quot;x&quot; is always within its own set of parentheses. This way, it will be evaluated in whole, before being compared to 0 or multiplied by -1. Also, the entire macro is surrounded by parentheses, to prevent it from being contaminated by other code. If you're not careful, you run the risk of having the compiler misinterpret your code.

Because of side-effects it is considered a very bad idea to use macro functions as described above.

 int x = -10;
 int y = ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x++ );

If ABSOLUTE_VALUE() were a real function 'x' would now have the value of '-9', but because it was an argument in a macro it was expanded twice and thus has a value of -8.

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fefefe; border: solid 1px black; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
Example:

To illustrate the dangers of macros, consider this naive macro
 #define MAX(a,b) a&gt;b?a:b
and the code
 i = MAX(2,3)+5;
 j = MAX(3,2)+5;
Take a look at this and consider what the value after execution might be.  The statements are turned into 
 int i = 2&gt;3?2:3+5;
 int j = 3&gt;2?3:2+5;
Thus, after execution &lt;tt&gt;i=8&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j=3&lt;/tt&gt; instead of the expected result of &lt;tt&gt;i=j=8&lt;/tt&gt;! This is why you were cautioned to use an extra set of parenthesis above, but even with these, the road is fraught with dangers. The alert reader might quickly realize that if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; contains expressions, the definition must parenthesize every use of &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; in the macro definition, like this:
 #define MAX(a,b) ((a)&gt;(b)?(a):(b))
This works, provided &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; have no side effects. Indeed, 
 i = 2;
 j = 3;
 k = MAX(i++, j++);
would result in &lt;tt&gt;k=4&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i=3&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j=5&lt;/tt&gt;. This would be highly surprising to anyone expecting &lt;tt&gt;MAX()&lt;/tt&gt; to behave like a function.

So what is the correct solution? The solution is not to use macro at all. A global, inline function, like this

 inline int max(int a, int b) { 
   return a&gt;b?a:b 
 }

has none of the pitfalls above, but will not work with all types.

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE: The explicit &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; declaration is not really necessary unless the definition is in a header file, since your compiler can inline functions for you (with gcc this can be done with &lt;code&gt;-finline-functions&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt;). The compiler is often better than the programmer at predicting which functions are worth inlining. Also, function calls are not really expensive (they used to be). 

The compiler is actually free to ignore the &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; keyword. It is only a hint (except that &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; is necessary in order to allow a function to be defined in a header file without generating an error message due to the function being defined in more than one translation unit).

('''#, ##''')

The '''#''' and '''##''' operators are used with the &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; macro. Using # causes the first argument after the '''#''' to be returned as a string in quotes. For example, the command 

 #define as_string( s ) # s
		
will make the compiler turn this command 

 puts( as_string( Hello World! ) ) ;
		
into 

 puts( &quot;Hello World!&quot; );
		
Using '''##''' concatenates what's before the '''##''' with what's after it. For example, the command 

 #define concatenate( x, y ) x ## y
 ...
 int xy = 10;
 ...
	
will make the compiler turn 

 printf( &quot;%d&quot;, concatenate( x, y ));
		
into 

 printf( &quot;%d&quot;, xy);
		
which will, of course, display &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt; to standard output.

It is possible to concatenate a macro argument with a constant prefix or suffix to obtain a valid identifier as in

 #define make_function( name ) int my_ ## name (int foo) {}
 make_function( bar )

which will define a function called &lt;tt&gt;my_bar()&lt;/tt&gt;. But it isn't possible to integrate a macro argument into a constant string using the concatenation operator. In order to obtain such an effect, one can use the ANSI C property that two or more consecutive string constants are considered equivalent to a single string constant when encountered. Using this property, one can write

 #define eat( what ) puts( &quot;I'm eating &quot; #what &quot; today.&quot; )
 eat( fruit )

which the macro-processor will turn into

 puts( &quot;I'm eating &quot; &quot;fruit&quot; &quot; today.&quot; )

which in turn will be interpreted by the C parser as a single string constant.

The following trick can be used to turn a numeric constants into string literals

 #define num2str(x) str(x)
 #define str(x) #x
 #define CONST 23
 
 puts(num2str(CONST));

This is a bit tricky, since it is expanded in 2 steps. First &lt;code&gt;num2str(CONST)&lt;/code&gt; is replaced with &lt;code&gt;str(23)&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn is replaced with &lt;code&gt;&quot;23&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. This can be useful in the following example:

 #ifdef DEBUG
 #define debug(msg) fputs(__FILE__ &quot;:&quot; num2str(__LINE__) &quot; - &quot; msg, stderr)
 #else
 #define debug(msg)
 #endif

This will give you a nice debug message including the file and the line where the message was issued. If DEBUG is not defined however the debugging message will completely vanish from your code. Be careful not to use this sort of construct with anything that has side effects, since this can lead to bugs, that appear and disappear depending on the compilation parameters.

===macros===

Macros aren't type-checked and so they do not evaluate arguments. Also, they do not obey scope properly, but simply take the string passed to them and replace each occurrence of the macro argument in the text of the macro with the actual string for that parameter (the code is literally copied into the location it was called from).

An example on how to use a macro:
&lt;pre&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 #define SLICES 8
 #define ADD(x) ( (x) / SLICES )

 int main(void) 
 {
   int a = 0, b = 10, c = 6;

   a = ADD(b + c);
   printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, a);
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
-- the result of &quot;a&quot; should be &quot;2&quot; (b + c = 16 -&gt; passed to ADD -&gt; 16 / SLICES -&gt; result is &quot;2&quot;)

NOTE:&lt;br&gt;
It is usually bad practice to define macros in headers.

A macro should be defined only when it is not possible to achieve the same result with a 
function or some other mechanism. Some compilers are able to optimize code to where calls to small functions are replaced with inline code, negating any possible speed advantage.
Using typedefs, enums, and &lt;tt&gt;inline&lt;/tt&gt; (in C99) is often a better option.
|}

One of the few situations where inline functions won't work -- so you are pretty much forced to use function-like macros instead -- is to initialize compile time constants (static initialization of structs).
This happens when the arguments to the macro are literals that the compiler can optimize to another literal.

===#error===
The '''#error''' directive halts compilation.   When one is encountered the standard specifies that the compiler should emit a diagnostic containing the remaining tokens in the directive.  This is mostly used for debugging purposes.

Programmers use &quot;#error&quot; inside a conditional block, to immediately halt the compiler when the &quot;#if&quot; or &quot;#ifdef&quot; -- at the beginning of the block -- detects a compile-time problem.
Normally the compiler skips the block (and the &quot;#error&quot; directive inside it) and the compilation proceeds.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #error message
&lt;/source&gt;

===#warning===

Many compilers support a  '''#warning''' directive. When one is encountered, the compiler emits a diagnostic containing the remaining tokens in the directive.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  #warning message
&lt;/source&gt;

===#undef===
The '''#undef''' directive undefines a macro.  The identifier need not have been previously defined.

===#if,#else,#elif,#endif (conditionals)===
The '''#if''' command checks whether a controlling conditional expression evaluates to zero or nonzero, and excludes or includes a block of code respectively. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #if 1
    /* This block will be included */
 #endif
 #if 0
    /* This block will not be included */
 #endif
&lt;/source&gt;

The conditional expression could contain any C operator except for the assignment operators, the increment and decrement operators, the address-of operator, and the sizeof operator.

One unique operator used in preprocessing and nowhere else is the '''defined''' operator. It returns 1 if the macro name, optionally enclosed in parentheses, is currently defined; 0 if not.

The '''#endif''' command ends a block started by &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;#ifndef&lt;/code&gt;.

The '''#elif''' command is similar to &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, except that it is used to extract one from a series of blocks of code. E.g.:

&lt;pre&gt;
 #if /* some expression */
   :
   :
   :
 #elif /* another expression */
   :
 /* imagine many more #elifs here ... */
   :
 #else
 /* The optional #else block is selected if none of the previous #if or
    #elif blocks are selected */
   :
   :
 #endif /* The end of the #if block */
&lt;/pre&gt;

===#ifdef,#ifndef===

The '''#ifdef''' command is similar to &lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;, except that the code block following it is selected if a macro name is defined. In this respect,

 #ifdef NAME

is equivalent to

 #if defined NAME



The '''#ifndef''' command is similar to '''#ifdef''', except that the test is reversed:

 #ifndef NAME

is equivalent to

 #if !defined NAME

== Useful Preprocessor Macros for Debugging ==
ANSI C defines some useful preprocessor macros and variables,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://docs.hp.com/en/B3901-90003/ch07s04.html HP C Compiler Reference Manual]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/preprocessor/preprocessor_vars C++ reference: Predefined preprocessor variables]
&lt;/ref&gt;
also called &quot;magic constants&quot;, include:

__FILE__   =&gt; The name of the current file, as a string literal&lt;br/&gt;
__LINE__   =&gt; Current line of the source file, as a numeric literal&lt;br/&gt;
__DATE__   =&gt; Current system date, as a string&lt;br/&gt;
__TIME__   =&gt; Current system time, as a string&lt;br/&gt;
__TIMESTAMP__ =&gt; Date and time (non-standard)&lt;br/&gt;
__cplusplus =&gt; undefined when your C code is being compiled by a C compiler; 199711L when your C code is being compiled by a C++ compiler compliant with 1998 C++ standard.&lt;br/&gt;
__func__ =&gt; Current function name of the source file, as a string (part of C99)&lt;br/&gt;
__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ =&gt; &quot;decorated&quot; Current function name of the source file, as a string (in GCC; non-standard)&lt;br/&gt;

==== Compile-time assertions ====

Compile-time assertions can help you debug faster than using only run-time assert() statements, because the compile-time assertions are all tested at compile time, while it is possible that a test run of a program may fail to exercise some run-time assert() statements.

Prior to the C11 standard, some people&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.jaggersoft.com/pubs/CVu11_3.html &quot;Compile Time Assertions in C&quot;] by Jon Jagger 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Pádraig Brady.
[http://www.pixelbeat.org/programming/gcc/static_assert.html &quot;static assertion&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27586311/ternary-operator-with-a-constant-true-value &quot;ternary operator with a constant (true) value?&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
defined a preprocessor macro to allow compile-time assertions, something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT(pred) switch(0){case 0:case pred:;}

COMPILE_TIME_ASSERT( BOOLEAN CONDITION );
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;static_assert.hpp&lt;/code&gt; [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost | Boost library]] defines a similar macro.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: C++0x#Static assertions]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since C11, such macros are obsolete, as &lt;code&gt;_Static_assert&lt;/code&gt; and its macro equivalent &lt;code&gt;static_assert&lt;/code&gt; are standardized and built-in to the language.

==== X-Macros ====
{{merge to | C Programming/Serialization#X-Macros}}

One little-known usage pattern of the C preprocessor is known as &quot;X-Macros&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;X_macros&quot;&gt;Wirzenius, Lars.

Includes &quot;Practical Applications of the Preprocessor II: The X Macro Trick&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
An X-Macro is a [[C++ Programming‎/Programming Languages‎/C++‎/Code/File Organization#.h|header file]] or macro.  Commonly these use the extension &quot;.def&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;.h&quot;. This file contains a list of similar macro calls, which can be referred to as &quot;component macros&quot;.  The include file is then referenced repeatedly in the following pattern.  Here, the include file is &quot;xmacro.def&quot; and it contains a list of component macros of the style &quot;foo(x, y, z)&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define foo(x, y, z) doSomethingWith(x, y, z);
#include &quot;xmacro.def&quot;
#undef foo

#define foo(x, y, z) doSomethingElseWith(x, y, z);
#include &quot;xmacro.def&quot;
#undef foo

(etc...)
&lt;/source&gt;

The most common usage of X-Macros is to establish a list of C objects and then automatically generate code for each of them. Some implementations also perform any &lt;code&gt;#undef&lt;/code&gt;s they need inside the X-Macro, as opposed to expecting the caller to undefine them.

Common sets of objects are a set of global configuration settings, a set of members of a [[struct (C programming language)|struct]], a list of possible [[XML]] tags for converting an XML file to a quickly-traversable tree, or the body of an [[enumerated type|enum]] declaration; other lists are possible.

Once the X-Macro has been processed to create the list of objects, the component macros can be redefined to generate, for instance, [[mutator method|accessor and/or mutator]] functions.  Structure [[serialization|serializing and deserializing]] are also commonly done.

Here is an example of an X-Macro that establishes a struct and automatically creates serialize/deserialize functions. For simplicity, this example doesn't account for endianness or buffer overflows.

File '''star.def''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(x, int)
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(y, int)
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(z, int)
EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(radius, double)
#undef EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
&lt;/source&gt;

File '''star_table.c''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) type member;
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  } starStruct;

void serialize_star(const starStruct *const star, unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(buffer, &amp;(star-&gt;member), sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }

void deserialize_star(starStruct *const star, const unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(&amp;(star-&gt;member), buffer, sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Handlers for individual data types may be created and accessed using token concatenation (&quot;&lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) and quoting (&quot;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) operators.
For example, the following might be added to the above code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define print_int(val)    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, val)
#define print_double(val) printf(&quot;%g&quot;, val)

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* print_##type will be replaced with print_int or print_double */
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot;, #member); \
    print_##type(star-&gt;member); \
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that in this example you can also avoid the creation of separate handler functions for each datatype in this example by defining the print format for each supported type, with the additional benefit of reducing the expansion code produced by this header file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define FORMAT_(type) FORMAT_##type
#define FORMAT_int    &quot;%d&quot;
#define FORMAT_double &quot;%g&quot;

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* FORMAT_(type) will be replaced with FORMAT_int or FORMAT_double */
  #define EXPAND_EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot; FORMAT_(type) &quot;\n&quot;, #member, star-&gt;member);
  #include &quot;star.def&quot;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The creation of a separate header file can be avoided by creating a single macro containing what would be the contents of the file.  For instance, the above file &quot;star.def&quot; could be replaced with this macro at the beginning of:

File '''star_table.c''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define EXPAND_STAR \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(x, int) \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(y, int) \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(z, int) \
  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(radius, double)
&lt;/source&gt;

and then all calls to &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;star.def&quot;&lt;/code&gt; could be replaced with a simple &lt;code&gt;EXPAND_STAR&lt;/code&gt; statement.  The rest of the above file would become:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
typedef struct {
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) type member;
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  } starStruct;

void serialize_star(const starStruct *const star, unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(buffer, &amp;(star-&gt;member), sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  }

void deserialize_star(starStruct *const star, const unsigned char *buffer) {
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    memcpy(&amp;(star-&gt;member), buffer, sizeof(star-&gt;member)); \
    buffer += sizeof(star-&gt;member);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef  EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

and the print handler could be added as well as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define print_int(val)    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, val)
#define print_double(val) printf(&quot;%g&quot;, val)

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* print_##type will be replaced with print_int or print_double */
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot;, #member); \
    print_##type(star-&gt;member); \
    printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
}
&lt;/source&gt;

or as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define FORMAT_(type) FORMAT_##type
#define FORMAT_int    &quot;%d&quot;
#define FORMAT_double &quot;%g&quot;

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  /* FORMAT_(type) will be replaced with FORMAT_int or FORMAT_double */
  #define EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER(member, type) \
    printf(&quot;%s: &quot; FORMAT_(type) &quot;\n&quot;, #member, star-&gt;member);
  EXPAND_STAR
  #undef EXPAND_STAR_MEMBER
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

A variant which avoids needing to know the members of any expanded sub-macros is to accept the operators as an argument to the list macro:

File '''star_table.c''':
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*
 Generic
 */
#define STRUCT_MEMBER(member, type, dummy) type member;

#define SERIALIZE_MEMBER(member, type, obj, buffer) \
  memcpy(buffer, &amp;(obj-&gt;member), sizeof(obj-&gt;member)); \
  buffer += sizeof(obj-&gt;member);

#define DESERIALIZE_MEMBER(member, type, obj, buffer) \
  memcpy(&amp;(obj-&gt;member), buffer, sizeof(obj-&gt;member)); \
  buffer += sizeof(obj-&gt;member);

#define FORMAT_(type) FORMAT_##type
#define FORMAT_int    &quot;%d&quot;
#define FORMAT_double &quot;%g&quot;

/* FORMAT_(type) will be replaced with FORMAT_int or FORMAT_double */
#define PRINT_MEMBER(member, type, obj) \
  printf(&quot;%s: &quot; FORMAT_(type) &quot;\n&quot;, #member, obj-&gt;member);

/*
 starStruct
 */

#define EXPAND_STAR(_, ...) \
  _(x, int, __VA_ARGS__) \
  _(y, int, __VA_ARGS__) \
  _(z, int, __VA_ARGS__) \
  _(radius, double, __VA_ARGS__)

typedef struct {
  EXPAND_STAR(STRUCT_MEMBER, )
  } starStruct;

void serialize_star(const starStruct *const star, unsigned char *buffer) {
  EXPAND_STAR(SERIALIZE_MEMBER, star, buffer)
  }

void deserialize_star(starStruct *const star, const unsigned char *buffer) {
  EXPAND_STAR(DESERIALIZE_MEMBER, star, buffer)
  }

void print_star(const starStruct *const star) {
  EXPAND_STAR(PRINT_MEMBER, star)
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

This approach can be dangerous in that the entire macro set is always interpreted as if it was on a single source line, which could encounter compiler limits with complex component macros and/or long member lists.

This technique was reported by Lars Wirzenius&lt;ref&gt;Wirzenius, Lars. [http://liw.iki.fi/liw/texts/cpp-trick.html C Preprocessor Trick For Implementing Similar Data Types] Retrieved January 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in a web page dated January 17, 2000, in which he gives credit to Kenneth Oksanen for &quot;refining and developing&quot; the technique prior to 1997.  The other references describe it as a method from at least a decade before the turn of the century.

== The package Text_IO ==

Used for simple [[Ada Programming/Input Output|Input Output]] (IO) in text format.

== Tips and Tricks for Text_IO ==

=== Read a whole line from the console ===

Ada 2005 has a function &lt;code&gt;Get_Line&lt;/code&gt; which returns a newly created string containing the whole line:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_Line {{Ada/kw|return}} String;

With older Ada generations, you need a little work to get the complete line with one call.
The &lt;code&gt;Get_Line&lt;/code&gt; procedure gets a line of text of as many characters the Item can hold
or up to the new_line indicator, whichever comes first. (The new_line indicator's representation is
implementation defined.)
It has the following specification:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Get_Line (Item: {{Ada/kw|out}} String; Last: {{Ada/kw|out}} Natural);

To be specific, consider an Item that can hold as much as 80 characters. Let's take two lines to read, one holding
less that 80 characters, say 10, the other at least 80, perhaps more. Calling

 Get_Line (Item, Last);

will read the first line up to the new_line indicator and consume them; Item's first 10 characters will be filled
with the text read, the rest is junk; Last will hold the last filled index.

The next call will read the maximum Item can hold, i.e. 80 characters; the rest of the line (if any) and the
new_line indicator remain unconsumed.
Thus Last will be &lt;code&gt;Item'First - 1 + 80&lt;/code&gt;.
In order to consume the rest of the line, you have to call &lt;code&gt;Get_Line&lt;/code&gt; again.
The result will be like one of the two possibilities above, depending on the remaining line length.
If no characters are read (i.e. when the new_line indicator is the only thing left unread), Last will hold
value &lt;code&gt;Item'First - 1&lt;/code&gt;.

The following example shows how the complete line could be read:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
 
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get_Line {{Ada/kw|return}} String {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Ustr {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
   {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
   Everything: Ustr.Unbounded_String := Ustr.Null_Unbounded_String;
   Item      : String (1 .. 80);
   Last      : Natural;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   Get_Whole_Line:
   {{Ada/kw|loop}}
     T_IO.Get_Line (Item, Last);                                        -- *
     Ustr.Append (Source =&gt; Everything, New_Item =&gt; Item (1 .. Last));  -- *
     {{Ada/kw|exit}} Get_Whole_Line {{Ada/kw|when}} Last &lt; Item'{{Ada/attribute|Last}};  -- **
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}} Get_Whole_Line;
 
   {{Ada/kw|return}} Ustr.To_String (Everything);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Get_Line;

As an exercise, change the calls at (*) to

 T_IO.Get_Line (Item (11 .. 20), Last);
 Ustr.Append (Source =&gt; Everything, New_Item =&gt; Item (11 .. Last));

and see which values Item and Last will hold. Which criterium will you then need to exit the loop at (**)?

(This is of course not a very sensible idea to code like this, but as a learning instruction, it's fine.)

=== Read a whole line from a file ===

In principle it is the same as in console reading but you have to check for the end of file as well:

 {{Ada/kw|exit}} Get_Whole_Line {{Ada/kw|when}} Last &lt; Item'{{Ada/attribute|Last}}
                       {{Ada/kw|or}} T_IO.End_Of_File (File);

End_of_File is always False for console input (except when you manage to enter the implementation defined end_of_file indicator).
A well-formed text file (i.e. one created with Ada.Text_IO) will always hold an end_of_line (and an end_of_page) indicator before the
end_of_file indicator (see procedure &lt;code&gt;Close&lt;/code&gt;).

If you have to write code that can be used on various platforms (OS 9, OS X, and windows) you will run into some problems with psychtoolbox. This is due to different versions that run on different platforms and having different procedures for handling the screen. 

Using a few scripts that handle these differences, and calling these scripts can make your programs a little more universally accepted.

The scripts listed here will be changing often to match the current versions of the psychtoolbox, and you should check to see if your version is up to date. If you make any changes to the scripts on these pages, please make note of the date of the revision and what you changed, so that users of the scripts will know what was updtated.

===Scripts and functions===
*[[Psychtoolbox:ptb_ind_screen_setup.m|ptb_ind_screen_setup.m]] - April 7, 2005 - This script is used to set up the psychtoolbox screen function in a 
universal way to allow the same program to be run on windows, OS X,
and classic mac.
 
*[[Psychtoolbox:ptb_ind_flip.m|ptb_ind_flip.m]]- April 7, 2005 - 
This function is set up to allow the same code to be used in the 
new and old versions of psychtoolbox
&lt;br&gt;
screen_setup should be called at the begining of your script. This
should be called whenever you want to put what you have drawn 
on the screen.

*[[Psychtoolbox:ptb_ind_general_setup.m|ptb_ind_general_setup.m]] - July 6, 2005 - Used for other general setup information (directory seperation - / or :, left arrow right arrow interpretations, etc)

===Examples of use===
*[[Psychtoolbox:expanding_rectangle.m|expanding_rectangle.m]] - April 7, 2005

I was considering writing an automated job for the source code translations - but now I wonder if there is one already and I am too late ;-). --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:45, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== program for inserting the templates? ===

If you mean a program for inserting the templates - I have writen an ugly emacs script but it is full of bugs. It helps me in doing the translation but I still have to manually edit the page and load it in emacs with mozex (a mozilla extension). Of course the better would be to have a bot that downloads the page and performs the necessary conversion, too much for me. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:10, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Yes, using AdaCL ===

I was considering an AdaCL script and down/upload is not an issue since the aim is for &quot;working demos&quot; and they need real and tested source codes anyway. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:10, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

Put the new vertices on the gray line? What gray line??

Bryan

&quot;Then, select the vertices in the middle of the bone and press GKEY for grab and put it down like this.&quot;

Like what?? Please provide the pictures... We are all beginners here, how are we suppose to know what you mean by 'like this'??

Stanley, yet another frustrated beginner.

: Don't worry guys, here you will see all those nice missing pictures in the future. In the meantime you can check other finished [[Blender 3D: Tutorial Links List|Blender tutorials]].--[[User:Popski|Popski]] 11:52, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)


==Illustrations==
For those who need illustrations like myself, go to this website: [http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/book1.html]http://www.blender.org/modules/documentation/htmlI/book1.html

Then, scroll down to 'Table of Contents' and click on 'Your first animation in 30+30 minutes'. This guide you in building your gingerbreadman, but with more illustrations. Enjoy your learnings!

:That link seems to be invalid now. However, Googling for the name, it seems that the gingerbreadman tutorial is also available here: http://download.blender.org/documentation/htmlI/c1208.html --[[User:Slapout|Slapout]] 21:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::That one looks dead also. Here's new link http://docs.huihoo.com/blender/user-guide-2.3/ch04.html found from Google -- Roli

Added a simple graphic for the meantime. It should look better, but at least people will be able to understand what to do.


==Added images==
I added some images and then changed the text to be consistent with what was produced.  A speherical head just didn't make sense for a gingerbread man.
--[[user:Darkonc|Darkonc]] 11:33  6 Oct 2005 (PDT)


==Smoothing the head==
The text said to smooth the head first but the picture showed the body smoothed first. It doesn't matter which you smooth first, so I changed the order in the text. Also, the intro description says this page will cover basic lighting, but it doesn't. Should the page be marked as incomplete?
[[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 20:23, 30 October 2005 (UTC)


== Redundant tutorial (double)==
This feels just like the man produced in the earlier steps, with the exception that this one feels easier... Replace? [[User:81.224.183.67|81.224.183.67]] 20:27, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

I think the original gingerbread man tutorial also included armature and simple animation.
[[User:69.91.82.27|69.91.82.27]] 22:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, i totally agree. This didnt bring any new knowledge inn. Its just plain simple, and a lack of progress.

This could become an advanced tutorial in modeling, if the gum drops and the  way to texture them, as well as adding bones, and how to add/remove mesh areas from bones they don't belong too were added. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:21, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

This tutorial doesn't seem to be very different from modelling a simple person 1 and 2.

== Improper Modeling Technique ==

The head should not be a separate object from the body. Why don't we scrap this tutorial altogether?

: I may just be a noob, but all these reasons for removal sound good to me. Didn't introduce anything new really. Go ahead! Remove! Or add as a footnote to the simple man modelling.


== Great texture button screen shots ==
I think the great screen shots of the texture panels should be added to the volcano tutorial. [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 23:22, 8 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

Gujarati is a language with grammatical gender. There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

Nouns can often, but by no means always, be identified as to their gender according to their ending. These same gender-linked suffixes are used to make adjectives, verbs, and even adverbs agree with nouns in Gujarati sentences.

==Introduction==
Brew is Qualcomm's mobile operating system for mobile handsets.  Prior to version 2.0 Qualcomm did not offer J2ME for their platform.  Usually, to determine the optional APIs(JSRs) you end up tracking by JVM Vendor and version on device.

==Brew 2.0==
*Supports MIDP 2.0 CLDC 1.0 via on air download of JVM, not fully enabled out of box.

==Brew 2.1(True Brew)==
The Esmertec JBed CLDC is one of the JVM solutions used by OEMs for Brew. Here I have listed the minimum known common J2ME components as you will have to track by JVM Vendor and JVM version on device to detemine the optional APIs(JSRs) that you can access on that device.

*Supports MIDP 2.0 and CLDC 1.0 fully enabled
*WMA JSR 120
*MMAPI JSR 135

==Brew 3.0==

a.k.a Robert Engelhardt

==Education==
Robert holds a bachelors degree in Computer Science, which essentially means he spends entirely too much time in front of a computer. This doesn’t necessarily mean he knows how to use a computer better than anyone without such a degree, it just means he knows a few more technical terms he can shout between curses as everything goes wrong.
Robert also nearly held a minor in psychology, but decided against that rout when it meant that he would have to stay on an extra semester to get it.

==Hobbies==
Other than his interest in beekeeping, Robert also enjoys SCUBA diving, gardening, cooking and computer programming.

==Wiki Books Worked On==
===[[Beekeeping]]===
Robert has been interested in bees and beekeeping for a while but has not yet had the ability to actually keep bees until this year (2005). Right now his intentions are to remain a hobbyist, but he would like to introduce the world to such an entreating and possibly even profitable hobby by beginning a [[Beekeeping]] Wiki Book and adding to other such Wikis.
===[[Cookbook]]===
In some degree of relation to beekeeping, Robert tends to (or wants to) post recipes in regards to [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]; after all it is a spectacular substance that he believes is quite underrated.

One recipe Robert enjoys particular is [[Cookbook:Honey Taffy| Honey Taffy]], why not give it a try.

==Contact Info==
Robert can be contacted via e-mail at rheone &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt; at &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; gmail &lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt; dot &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; com

==Special Thanks==
Robert is not known for perfect grammar, or spelling and he finds it hard enough to talk about himself in 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; person, but continues to do it in this profile regardless. Either way, Robert is aware of many of his imperfections, and if you become aware of any of them please correct them. Robert thanks you :)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''What is Universal Design?'''&lt;br&gt; ==
Universal Design seeks to make instruction available and accessible to all learners. Limitations for learning should not present themselves due to differences in learning style, ability, or background.   

Universal Design does not support a one-size-fits all philosophy.  To the contrary, it emphasizes that learning opportunities need to be flexible to meet diverse needs.  If materials are designed for universal use, they will not need to be altered for use.  Differentiation will occur naturally.

Research is being completed to further develop an understanding of and practical uses for Universal Design.   [http://www.cast.org The Center for Applied Special Technology] is focusing on brain research and multimedia technology as research avenues that will further comprehension for designing effective instruction for all people.

== '''Origins of Universal Design''' ==
Universal Design originated in the field of architecture.  It seeks to meet the needs of a diverse public by making buildings accessible to all users.  To ensure that this occurs, the fundamentals of universal design   must be incorporated into the design process from the initial stages of the project. 

Universal design should benefit more than one group of users.  For example, curb ramps on sidewalks aid people in wheel chairs, people pushing strollers, and people riding bicycles.   

== '''Principles of Universal Design''' ==
Universal-design principles emphasize equitable use, flexibility, and adaptability.&lt;br&gt;
These standards are met by creating materials with the following qualities:

* '''Simplicity:''' Materials should be simple, intuitive, and easy to comprehend, regardless of the user's prior knowledge or skill set. 

* '''Clarity:''' Materials should provide clear directions, questions and expectations. 

* '''Accessibility:''' Materials should be usable with minimal physical effort. 

* '''Legibility:'''  Materials should be sized spaced for ease of viewing. &lt;br&gt;

* '''Positive:''' Materials should minimize accommodate unintended actions or errors with feedback.

* '''Supportive:''' Materials should provide built-in supports, such as help, multi-modality, and faculty-contact information.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For more information on the principles of Universal Design visit either of the following web sites:&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.design.ncsu.edu:8120/cud/univ_design/princ_overview.htm Center for Universal Design, NC State University]&lt;br&gt;
[http://web.archive.org/web/20050301193835/http://telr.osu.edu/dpg/fastfact/mswfiles/UniversalDesign.doc Universal Instructional Design, Ohio State University]

== '''Jakob Nielsen''' ==

[http://www.nngroup.com/ Nielsen] is a fore runner with regard to making things available to people.  His research focuses on universal design, usability, and accessibility for the Internet.  He has developed Web design guidelines that serve as a checklist for whether or not a website possesses user centered design.  He has patents on 76 different items, most are different things that can be used to make the Internet more accessible to a wide range of people with special needs.

== '''Usability''' ==

Five attributes can be assessed to determine the ease of interface usage.  &lt;br&gt;

* Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks? &lt;br&gt;

* Efficiency: How quickly can they perform tasks? &lt;br&gt;

* Memorability: How easily can they re-establish proficiency? &lt;br&gt;

* Error: How many errors on the site?  What occurs if an error is made?  &lt;br&gt;

* Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the site?

== '''Web Accessibility''' ==

[[Instructional Technology/Web Content Accessibility Guidelines/W3C guidelines|The World Wide Web Consortium]](W3C) develops and maintains the protocols used on the Web to insure interoperability to promote universal access. The W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has proposed guidelines for all Web authors.
Designing a well-organized Web site helps visitors navigate through the information presented. Some web development packages, such as [[Instructional Technology/Macromedia Dreamweaver|Macromedia Dreamweaver]], now possess the capability to preview page designs as they would look in different web browsers.  
*Maintain a simple, consistent page layout throughout your site. 
*Keep backgrounds simple. Make sure there is enough contrast. 
*Use standard HTML. 
*Caption video and transcribe other audio. 
*Make links descriptive so that they are understood out of context. 
*Include appropriate ALT/LONGDESC attributes for graphical elements on your page. 
*Include descriptive captions or other options for making graphical features accessible. 
*Provide alternatives for content in applets and plug-ins.
*Condensing text content &lt;br&gt;
*Spell-check and proof read &lt;br&gt;
*Locate and correct broken links &lt;br&gt;
*Include contact information and copyright notice &lt;br&gt;
*Provide contact information &lt;br&gt;
*Provide URL redirection when pages relocate &lt;br&gt; 
Test your Web site with a variety of Web browsers, and always test your pages with at least one text-based browser and with multi-media browsers with graphics and sound-loading features turned off. This way you will see your Web resources from the many perspectives of your users. Also, view the resources at your site using a variety of computing platforms, monitor sizes, and screen resolutions. Make sure you can access all of the features of your Web site with the keyboard alone, simulating the experience of Web users who cannot use a mouse. Make use of accessibility testing software such as A-Prompt, Bobby, and WAVE; they will point out elements that could be inaccessible. Then, revise your HTML to make your site accessible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Project Based Learning Definitions'''

The Buck Institute for Education (BIE)[http://www.bie.org] defines Project based learning (PBL) as &quot;a systematic teaching method that engages students in learning knowledge and skills through an extended inquiry process structured around complex, authentic questions and carefully designed products and tasks.&quot;[http://www.bie.org/pbl/pblhandbook/intro.php]

PBL is not a new idea.  It has roots that go back to the late 60's and 70's with open classroom theory and industrial education.  In this day and age where teachers need to teach multiple things at various levels, a project based approach makes sense for a majority of teachers.  PBL promotes ways to introduce a wider range of learning activities into a normal classroom setting.  If done correctly, learners will take on the responsibility of the learning and discover connections to other leaning opportunities around them.  PBL also takes into account the learners own background and uses their prior experiences to make the learning more concrete.  

'''PBL Benefits to Students'''

When PBL is used in the classroom it makes students switch from their usual mindset.  The students are presented with a real life problem to work through to solution.  Many times they are required to come up with a few plausible fixes for a problem and told to justify which one they find to be the best.  Students that go through this process come away with a more developed knowledge of subject matter, higher levels of confidence and greater technical and collaborative skills.   Studies have shown that students who complete a course enriched by using PBL are more likely to develop higher levels of critical thinking and problem solving skills than their traditional classroom setting counterparts.  Leadership and collaborative skills also seem to be higher when PBL lessons are used.  [http://www.thejournal.com/magazine/vault/A5162A.cfm]

According to the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory benefits of project-based instruction include:

*Preparing learners for the workplace by exposing them to competencies such as collaboration, project planning, decision making, and time management
*Teachers often see increased motivation through higher levels of attendance, participation, and homework
*Learners have greater collaborative opportunities to construct knowledge
*Increases in social and communication skills
*Learners are able to see connections between disciplines
*Increased problem-solving  skills
*Increased learner self-esteem
*Learners use individual learning strengths and diverse approaches to learning
*Provides real-world experiences to learn and use technology[http://www.nwrel.org/request/2002aug/benefits.html]


'''Criteria For PBL Programs'''

BIE published a list of distinguishing criteria of PBL.  It appears to be a pretty good list and points out what PBL should encompass.  Here is what BIE's list looks like:

*Put the students at the center of the learning process by recognizing their inherent “drive to learn.”
*The project work is central rather than peripheral
*Stress issues that lead students to in-depth exploration of topics
*Require the use of essential tools and skills, including technology, for learning, self management, and project management
*Specify products that solve problems, explain dilemmas, or present information generated through investigation and research.
*Include multiple products that permit feedback
*Use performance-based assessments that communicate high expectations, various skills, and rigorous challenges
*Encourage collaboration through large or small group student-led presentations and class project result evaluations
*A definite beginning, middle and end
*Real world problems [http://www.bie.org/pbl/pblhandbook/intro.php#standards]

A typical PBL project for high school students might be to design a future school.  In doing this, students would be introduced to various advanced math and engineering concepts.  An elementary project might consist of building and racing electric cars to learn lessons about energy and efficiency.  All projects should give students hands-on, serious, authentic experiences.

'''Using Multiple Intelligences in Project Based Learning'''

John Dewey theorized that learning should not only prepare one for life, but should also be an integral part of life itself. Simulating real problems and real problem-solving is one function of project-based learning. Students help choose their own projects and create learning opportunities based upon their individual interests and strengths. Projects assist students in succeeding within the classroom and beyond, because they allow learners to apply '''multiple intelligences'''  [http://www.multi-intell.com] in completing a project they can be proud of. Our society values individuals who can solve problems creatively, using multiple strengths, so why shouldn't we encourage students to do the same? 

However, traditional teaching strategies tend to focus on verbal/linguistic and mathematical/logical intelligences alone. This can create frustration for people who are comfortable with less traditional learning modalities, such as kinesthetic, visual, interpersonal, intrapersonal, musical, or naturalist. Project-based learning allows the teacher to incorporate numerous teaching and learning strategies into project planning and implementation. Assisting learners in developing all of their intelligences will make learning a part of living, not just a preparation for it.

'''The Role of Technology'''

Without computers PBL would be very different and much more difficult.  Learners use word processors and databases to help them categorize, analyze and keep track of data.  They use the internet, email and online forums for research, communication and collaboration with the outside world.  The collaboration element has probably the biggest benefit to any learner.  It allows them to talk to numerous experts about a variety of subjects.  If used correctly, then learners share information with each other and in doing this, further their own learning.  Without these technological advancements the learners working knowledge base would not be as plentiful.

Added, technology PBL can enhance the relevance of classroom projects, and foster multidisciplinary exploration, where various activities and subjects are explored and integrated in the project. For example, concepts from Maths, Fine Arts, and Physics can be applied to projects in architecture and design. The collaborative approach to designing PBL instruction can enhance motivation and achievement, as well as promote active learning and effective communication.

'''PBL Research'''

Regie Stites of SRI, International, wrote that researchers have investigated the impact of project-based learning (PBL) in a wide variety of educational contexts ranging from early childhood education to medical and legal education. [http://pblmm.k12.ca.us/PBLGuide/pblresch.htm]

Stites mentions that the points below &quot;should be kept in mind when considering the findings of research that compare the relative impacts of PBL and more traditional learning activities on student achievement&quot;: 

*Project-based learning is typically implemented in the context of comprehensive educational reforms and therefore it is difficult to isolate the effects of PBL on student learning.
*Project-based learning and closely related instructional strategies (such as problem-based learning and the project approach) are implemented differently in different contexts and therefore it is difficult to compare results across cases. 
*Project-based learning is linked to a theory of learning (constructivism) that entails a shift in learning objectives (stressing higher order thinking skills and performance-based, authentic assessments) and therefore standardized achievement tests may not be the best measures of PBL's impact.

The online magazine Edutopia [http://www.edutopia.org/] published an article in 2001 listing several of the studies that has been completed in the area of project-based learning. The studies in the article shows that PBL can improve students’ skills in the areas of communication, teamwork and problem solving and improve in core academic areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Instructional Design Based on Knowledge Objects'''''

Based on a chapter by Merrill in Reigeluth's Green Book.


== What is ITT ==

Merrill introduces the Instructional Transaction Theory (ITT) as an attempt to provide more precision to designing instruction for different kinds of instructional outcomes and also as an attempt to make automated instructional design possible. As a synthesis oriented theory, ITT emphasizes the integration of the components of Merrill’s Component Display Theory (CDT) into instructional transactions. An instructional transaction is all of the interactions necessary for a student to acquire a particular kind of knowledge or skill.

By describing instructional strategies as algorithms or transactions used for manipulating data structures or knowledge objects, Merill aims to provide a more precise description of the different kinds of instructional transactions required for different kinds of instructional outcomes. Building appropriate instructional transactions into instructional development tools will enable automating certain steps of the instructional design process and will increase efficiency. ITT extends Gagne's conditions of learning and Merrill's Component Display Theory so that the rules and principles involved are enough to drive automated instructional design – a computer-based system that creates instruction based on instructional parameters input by designers.

== Merrill's Instructional Transactions ==

An important element of ITT is called a knowledge object. Knowledge objects provide a way to represent knowledge and are used to build a set of transaction shells (instructional algorithms) to teach it (Merrill, 1996; Merrill, 2000). The transaction shells consist of rules for selecting and sequencing knowledge objects. ITT integrates these components into instructional transactions which are made up of all the interactions necessary to acquire a particular kind of knowledge or skill.

Merrill presents instructional goals for the IDENTIFY, EXECUTE, and INTERPRET transactions (the first three of his 13 instructional classes). The referenced example is an open-ended learning environment designed to teach technicians how to install or remove a double seat valve in a pipe. Merrill describes the learning environment in terms of the instructional goal it is designed to promote, the knowledge structure required by the learning environment, the general simulation engine which operates on this knowledge structure, and the learning activity of exploration. He also describes the three instructional transactions of IDENTIFY, EXECUTE, and INTERPRET. For each transaction, the instructional goal, the knowledge structure, the presentation of information to the student, the practice with feedback, and the learner guidance are presented. 

The component methods of ITT illustrate a possible increase of precision with which instructional strategies can be described in the form of knowledge objects. The instructional strategies can be described as methods for manipulating the elements of knowledge objects. They enable the specification of executable knowledge, that is, they enable both tutorial and experiential instruction from the same knowledge representation.

== Personal Reflections on ITT ==

I believe that Instructional Transaction Theory (ITT) has enormous potential, but I am convinced that it is a method that can only be leveraged by the use of technology. A little while ago, I attempted what I thought would be a modest project using ITT. I decided to develop a blueprint for how I could teach my students to troubleshoot computer printers and printer problems in the High School computer lab. However, the many “what if” scenarios quickly became overwhelming... so many conditions, so many combinations leading to different outcomes, so many different kinds of printers. Even if I had fully developed the architecture or blueprint, it would have been so complex that no one could have used it without the help of technology. In the end, I realized that computers are much more adept than people at keeping track of the large volume of properties and conditions and running and remembering all the “what if” calculations.

I know that there are object-based, database-driven websites out there that have thousands of knowledge objects, and I know that there has been work done by the Army on how the Army can develop an object-based, “chunky” system for writing and publishing instructional doctrine. ITT makes perfect sense to me, and I think that ITT could transform instruction and instructional design. 

When knowledge objects and database structures finally become standardized, we will possess the potential to have reusable, updatable components of instruction that move at the speed of the Internet. And, if instructional designers would share and allow their work to be treated as “objects” that are publicly available, then it would seem easy to generate personalized, adaptive instruction in a relatively short period of time and at minimal cost. However, there is still a lot of research and practice necessary to enable automating certain steps of the instructional design process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Web Accessibility for Disabilities ==

&quot;Accessible Design&quot; calls for design that includes the needs of people whose physical, mental, or environmental conditions limit their performance. &quot;[[Instructional Technology/Learning Management Systems/Universal Design|Universal Design]]&quot; aims to extend standard design principles to include people of all ages and abilities, but remains at the level of generality—so does not address all the specific needs of any particular disability. 

But even for people who do not have any specific physical or mental characteristics that affect computer use, it has been found that adopting universal design principles can reduce fatigue, increase speed, decrease errors, and decrease learning time for all users. In many ways, universal design addresses the larger issues of usability making things easier for everyone. 

General Principles
*Allow for Flexibility 
*Provide choices in features and ways that tasks can be accomplished 
*Accommodate right- and left-handed use 
*Allow the user to customize settings whenever possible 
*Keep in mind that people may be using adaptive technologies 
Be Simple and Intuitive 
*Do not design something differently from user expectations just to be different 
*Eliminate unnecessary complexity 
*Provide feedback 
Minimize Errors 
*Provide warnings 
*Build fail-safe features when possible 
*Do not establish patterns when you want people to pay attention 
*Redundancy provides flexibility for different user preferences, system configurations, or user abilities. This can be accomplished by using more than one way to represent, display, and enter data, such as: 
**using both a beep and a menu bar flash to notify a user of an error using text to label images 
**redundantly allowing a user to issue commands by typing or selecting something with a pointer 
Avoid Side Effects
*Side effects should be avoided because they cause particular problems for novice users and disabled users who may have difficulty detecting or correcting certain types of side effects.

__TOC__


==Introduction==
Esmertec's Jbed JVM technology is implemented on multiple areas within the J2ME Platform ecological system.

==CLDC==
See on CPUs such as ARM, Intel StrongArm, Intel XScale, TI OMAP,  and C166 and on OSes such as Nucleus, AMX, Linux, REX, RTK, OSE, and RTXC.
*MIDP
**Jbed 3
***MIDP 1.0
***CLDC 1.0
**Jbed 4(Jcap)
***MIDP 2.0
***CLDC 1.0
***JTWI support
**Jbed Advance
***MIDP 2.0
***CLDC 1.1
***JTWI support
***3D Graphics JSR
***PIM JSR 75
*IMP
**CLDC 1.0 or CLDC 1.1
**IMP 1.0
**WMA

==CDC==
Seen on CPUs such as ARM, MIPS, SH3, SH4, PowerPC, and x86 and on OSes such as winCE, PocketPC, Linux, Qtopia, Unix, and VxWorks.  
*CDC 1.0
*Personal Profile 1.0
*Personal Basis Profile 1.0
*Foundation Profile 1.0
*RMI Optional Package 1.0
*JDBC Optional Package 1.0

==Deployed Devices==

===LGE===
*LGE G7100
**User Agent declares it is MIDP 2.0; however it rejects MIDP2 Jad files
**By using Class.forName some MIDP2 classes can be seen to be present
**MIDP 2
** Pre-compiles Jars when they have been downloaded, so they are not stored in standard bytecode on the device
**This process can fail

* LG C1200
* LG C1500
* LG F2100
* LG F9100

===Sendo===
*Sendo M570 MIDP2

===Siemens===
* Siemens CL75 MIDP2
* Siemens ST60 MIDP1

===Philips===
* Philips Fisio 535 MIDP2

==Conclusion==
Esmertec Jbed lacks some fundamentals in the date implementation on HTC mobiles. Thus makes the implementation useless for most business applications. If this is due to bad hardware or Esmertec Jbed is still unknown.

''Beekeeping'' is being designed as an all-purpose broad scope reference book pertaining to apiculture, including information regarding bees, beekeeping and associated practices. Although ''Beekeeping'' is being written with the initial intent in aiding hobbyist, it is a growing resource that could also aid commercial beekeepers similarly. This Wiki book however, is not being written in a completely linear manner. Because of the writing style of this book, through the act of simply reading it chapter-by-chapter content will be lost. Reading in this manner should still prove to be worthwhile, but more topics and greater depth may be uncovered by following links within the text.
Much like other Wiki based texts, ''Beekeeping'' is dependant on the collaborative effort of the community. If you have read your fill of this book and have some extra information that you can add, we request you do so, but before submitting please visit the [[Beekeeping/Editing Guide| Editing Guidelines and Information]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Request for Help==
'''Beekeeping''' is designed as a collaborative book based on beekeeping and apiary practices. It exists as a guide to both beginners and experts alike. However if there are any experts in the audience we ask that you donate some of your time to help this project out by submitting some text or media. Every additional amount of text is helpful, whether it be a simply adding missing punctuation or the addition of great body of text. This book cannot evolve on its own; it requires your help. Please don’t be discouraged even if you are not an expert; if you have something to add then please do so.  Any help is appreciated.

==Submitting Text==
Articles can be submitted in the same manner as any other Wiki submission, with one minor difference. Article links must be formed with a prefix of “Beekeeping” followed by a slash “/”. In example to submit a link about beekeeping fashion you must do the following
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Beekeeping/Fashion|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
Linking is done similarly to that of Namespace linking, in essence Beekeeping functions similarly to a namespace while not actually being one.

For a general reference guide of editing Wiki pages visit the [[Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page|How_to_edit_a_page]] page.

==New Book==
'''Beekeeping''' is a new book.  Because of this you will see a rather copious amount of red text, please help us by adding a missing article.

==If It’s Missing Add It==
If at any time you see that an article is missing, feel free to add it or add a request for it. Occasionally subjects can be overlooked and may not be added, other times no one has simply taken the time to add one, take the initiative and do so.

==Stand Back and Take a Bow==
If you have submitted anything to '''Beekeeping''' please add your name and any comments you might have to the [[Beekeeping/Contributors| Contributors]] list. Any added info you can relay in regards to your experience or background with bees would be an added plus.

==Faraday's Law==

In 1831, Faraday discovered the following three phenomena:
:1. If a coil of wire is pulled across a magnetic field, a current is induced.
:2. When a magnet is moved, a current is also induced.
:3. When the strength of the magnetic field is changed, a current is induced.

It is easy to understand the first phenomenon. We know that a coil of wire has free electrons inside. When the current is moved, these charges are in motion, so a magnetic force will cause them to move, creating a current.

Of course, we would immediately recognize that phenomenon 1 would imply phenomenon 2 by the relativity principle. However, its explanation in classical mechanics is less straightfoward. Clearly, since the wire isn't moving, there is no magnetic force (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_B=q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, it must be the ''electric'' field creating the current. Somehow, a changing magnetic field must ''induce'' an electric field.

It turns out that the induced emf in all 3 cases is given by &lt;math&gt;\xi=- \frac{\partial\Phi_B}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic flux. Most people would call this Faraday's Law, but this equation really encompasses two physical laws: the Lorentz Force Law, and the induction of electric fields. It is a miracle that the same equation would describe two different phenomena.

The direction of the induced current is given by Lenz's Law, which states that the induced current will try to ''oppose'' the change in flux. This explains the negative sign in Faraday's equation. Lenz's Law is necessary for the Law of Conservation of Energy to hold. 

Consider a metal plate falling through a space between two magnets. As it is falling, the magnetic flux would change, giving rise to a induced current, also known as an ''eddy current''. Lenz's Law tells us that this current will oppose the change in flux, and so the magnetic force would act upwards on the plate. Thus, its velocity will slow. This application is used to damp pendulums, and is important enough to be considered for motor design.

== How Generators Work ==

In an electric generator, a coil of wires is rotated in a magnetic field. As the coil rotates, the flux passing through a loop of the wire changes, and so a voltage is induced.

Suppose the coil has &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; turns. Then the induced voltage is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\xi= - N \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

By Lenz's Law, the resulting current flows in such a way that it will oppose the change in flux. Thus, if there were no external forces, the coil's rotation rate would slow down and eventually stop. This makes sense, for the current we induced carries energy, and because energy is conserved, the coil's rotation energy must decrease. Thus, a generator needs an external torque to turn the coil of wires.

=== Real Generators ===

Real generators generally spin a large magnet inside a Coil, in Australia we use three phase generators, meaning that there are in fact three coils, at 120 degree spacings. These generators produce voltages in the thousands. They are powered by sources such as coal, oil, and hydroelectric. In some countries Nuclear Fission is used to produce steam which turns turbines.

== More on Faraday's Law ==

Let us try to relate the emf with the electric field. As the electric field moves a charge down the wire, it does work &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt; per unit charge. The total work per unit charge it does in moving the charge through the wire must be the emf, so  
:&lt;math&gt;\xi=\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt;

The law of fluxes would then be:
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{\partial S} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -{d\Phi \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;


You might object, saying that the integral of an electric field along a closed path is always 0, or that the electric field is conservative, but that is only true for electro''static'' fields. Induced electric fields are never conservative, and there is no way of defining a potential energy for induced electric fields. &lt;math&gt;E=-\nabla \phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes false.

Faraday's Law is considered one of Maxwell's Equations. 

We can write it in its differential form by noting that &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}=\int_{A} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} \mathbf{E} \cdot ds=\int_{A} (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}=\int_{A} -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

'''Wine''' is an alcoholic drink commonly used to add flavor in cooking. Many types of cooking will evaporate the alcohol, leaving a nearly non-alcoholic dish. For uncooked usage of wine, see the numerous warnings on the [[Cookbook:Alcoholic_Drink|alcoholic drink]] page.

==Basic types of wine==
*'''[[Cookbook:Saki|sake]]''', a [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] wine used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cooking]]
*'''red wine''', a wine made from red or purple [[Cookbook:Grape|grapes]] and fermented with the skins
*'''white wine''', a wine made from green or yellow grapes, fermented without the skins
*'''rose or pink wine''', a wine made from grapes, following neither the red nor white procedure
*'''hard cider''', a wine made from [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]] juice

Hi and thanks for your contributions.  However Wikibooks is intended to be &quot;read&quot; in a standalone fashion and therefore content is what is required rather than weblinks.  This would be the case even if the page had quite a lot of text and certainly pages which merely contain links are unacceptable to us and so have been deleted. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

The '''grape''' is a popular small [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]].
Dried grapes are called [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]].
Grapes are commonly used to make [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]], and [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

Half of the world's fruit production goes to grapes. Most grapes are used for production of foods marketed as being without added [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. For this use, the juice is treated to remove the flavor and pretty much everything else except for the sugar and water.

Though not always, flavor can usually be guessed by color and size. Very large grapes tend to have a weak flavor. Green grapes also tend to have a weak flavor. Red grapes tend to have a fairly full flavor. Purple grapes tend to have the flavor of red grapes plus a sort of harsh bitter taste. Grapes with seeds tend to have better flavor than grapes without seeds.

Grapes are not normally cooked, except to demonstrate odd properties of a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]].
Cut the grape nearly in half, leaving a very thin connection. Place the grape in the microwave oven with the cut sides up. Microwave the grape.</text>

[said by 137.222.40.132, so I can't easily respond]

:I'm not so sure you improved things.

:While organic food is a dream come true for corporate marketing, it isn't really a scam. Well, not more than anything else being pushed these days. You do get what you pay for. Just realize that you're ''not'' avoiding big agriculture corporations. They love having a premium price product to get some extra profit out of people with money to burn.
:: Organic food IS often a scam. Most large-scale producers take the minimum amount of measures necessary to receive organic certification, ie. not very many. They are very good at finding loopholes. In many cases they simply stick the organic label on the food they would have sold as non-organic and triple the price. [[User:137.222.40.132|137.222.40.132]] 18:33, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::: To me, &quot;scam&quot; implies that you are being cheated. You are not cheated. Of course, you should not expect the producer to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. You might argue that the requirements are too loose of course, but AFAIK they are being met. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:39, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:The &quot;''Because organic food commands a high price, it is often treated better than non-organic food.''&quot; paragraph is not really an argument against organic food. You only see it that way because of your viewpoint. The paragraph argues for both sides. If you buy food for taste, you ''want'' it packed in foam and shipped by air.
:: It's not my viewpoint. It was only suggested by the previous negative tone of the article. [[User:137.222.40.132|137.222.40.132]] 18:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:Where do you get the idea that &quot;''Organically farmed animals generally receive more welfare''&quot;? I suspect that this is a hope you have. More than anything else, corporate marketing is about image. 
::What does corporate marketing have to do with animal welfare? Certification by the [http://www.soilassociation.org/ soil association] for instance requires higher standards of  animal welfare than government regulations. That's a fact, not a hope. [[User:137.222.40.132|137.222.40.132]] 18:33, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::What does a soilassociation certification have to do with &quot;organic&quot; products? At least in the USA, I'm pretty sure the FDA and USDA won't care. You can market something as organic with or without soilassociation certification. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:39, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:What do you mean that &quot;''Organic farming methods often discourage monoculture and its impact on species diversity.''&quot;? Everybody sane does crop rotation. Nobody can afford to grow things the old way, with beans growing up corn stalks and squash to provide weed control. In any case, species diversity of farming pests is not exactly a good thing.
::As you have mentioned before, you get what you pay for.
:::Sure, but ''nobody'' pays to have beans growing up cornstalks with squash all around. Normal &quot;organic&quot; produce comes from rather ordinary fields. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:39, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Alcoholic drinks''' are frequently used as [[Cookbook:Ingredients|ingredients]] in [[Cookbook:Recipes|recipes]]. This page lists the most common types used as ingredients. See the [[Bartending]] book for mixed drink recipes and other topics relating to direct uncooked consumption of alcoholic drinks.

Small amounts of alcohol can be useful for cardiovascular reasons and blood sugar. Harvard says &quot;For men, a good balance point is 1 to 2 drinks a day. For women, it's at most one drink a day.&quot; The USDA agrees, while also stating that women of childbearing age who are planning to become pregnant should completely avoid alcohol. Also, since ethyl alcohol turns to sugar in the bloodstream, it helps regulate blood sugar. See the warnings listed below though, while being aware that many people have difficulty keeping consumption moderate.

Refer to the wikipedia [[w:Effects of alcohol on the body|article]] for additional information but ultimately [[Wikibooks:Medical disclaimer|consult your doctor]] on health issues.

==[[Cookbook:Beer|Beer]]==
Beer is any variety of alcoholic drink produced by the brewing process: fermentation of starchy material derived from grains or other plant sources, such as malted barley or wheat. Beer typically has an alcoholic strength of from 3 to 8 percent.  However, certain Belgian and independent craft brewers produce beers with alcoholic strengths in excess of 8%, with 12 % not being uncommon for these styles.

==[[Cookbook:Cider|Cider]]==
Throughout most of the World cider is the fermented juice of apples (there are special cultivars used for cider making). In the USA cider normally refers to unfiltered unfermented apple juice and the alcoholic variety is known as &quot;hard cider&quot;. Cider, like beer, typically has an alcoholic strength of from 3 to 8 percent.

==[[Cookbook:Perry|Perry]]==

Perry or pear cider is an alcoholic beverage made of fermented pear juice. It is similar to cider, in that it is made using a similar process and often has a similar alcoholic content, up to 8.5% alcohol by volume.

==[[Cookbook:Wine|Wine]]==
Wine usually has an alcohol content of between 10 and 15 percent, and is made by fermentation of [[Cookbook:Grape|grape]] juice. [[w:Fruit wine|Fruit wine]]s are wine-like beverages made from fruits other than grapes. Fortified wine such as port and sherry is made by adding brandy to wine, increasing the strength to around 20 percent.

==[[Cookbook:Mead|Mead]]==
Mead is an alcoholic beverage made of honey, water, and yeast. It is roughly of the same alcoholic strength as wine, and is sometimes known as &quot;honey wine&quot;. Before import of grape wine became economical, mead was very popular in Northern Europe, including the British Isles, Poland and Scandinavia. In Viking Age Scandinavia, mead was considered to inspire skaldic poetry. Mead is probably also the origin of the word ''honeymoon'' as the father of the bride was said to give as a dowry a month's supply of the liquor.

==[[Cookbook:Spirits|Spirits]]==
The term '''spirits''' includes brandy, cognac, rum, vodka, gin, vermouth, and whisky; other spirits are not widely used in cooking. These are made by distilling weaker drinks to concentrate the alcohol content to 35 percent or more. Spirits are often used in dramatic formal flambe [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]], where a very high concentration of alcohol is required to allow ignition.

==Warnings==

Excessive consumption of alcohol may cause loss of social inhibition, vomiting, and a [[w:Hangover|hangover]]. In extreme cases, alcohol poisoning may occur, which can be fatal. It is known that excessive use for a prolonged period of time can cause liver diseases like cirrhosis, and may even alter brain functions.

Intoxicated people should not operate heavy machinery, including automobiles. Pregnant women should avoid alcoholic beverages, to prevent damage to the fetus ([[w:Fetal Alcohol Syndrome|Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]]).

Alcohol addiction ([[w:Alcoholism|alcoholism]]) can lead to weight gain and [[w:Cirrhosis|liver disease]].

Consumption is submitted to extensive regulation in most countries. In particular, a person not of legal drinking age who consumes alcohol may face legal troubles (along with their guardians, and/or those responsible for supplying the alcohol).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Classification of beers ==

People are often confused about types of beer (i.e. ale vs. lager vs. stout, etc).  Let me first say that &quot;Beer&quot; doesn't belong as a type of beer.  All beer is beer.

'''All''' beer is either an ''ale'' or a ''lager''.  The distinction has to do with the type of yeast used.  As a rule of thumb (but only that -- there are exceptions), ale yeast ferments quickly at high temperatures and floats on top during fermentation, while lager yeast ferments at more slowly at low temperatures and stays on the bottom of the fermenting vessel.  This is somewhat confused by the fact that the process of fermenting beer at low temperatures is called ''lagering'', quite apart from what yeast is used.  A homebrewer can easiler  lager an ale (i.e. use ale yeast but ferment a lager temperatures) or ferment a lager at ale temperatures.  This is quite rare AFAIK in the commercial beer world -- Anchor Steam is an example of the latter.  But it's still technically a lager.

Beer is divided into styles.  See, for example, [http://www.mv.com/ipusers/slack/bjcp/style-index.html the BJCP Style Guide].  Ale and lager are not styles.  Stouts, for example, are ales.  And there are many types of stout.

In short, the all to common Ale vs. Lager is not useful in describing beer.  It's kinda like saying the types of cars are &quot;two door&quot; and &quot;four door&quot;.  True, but it's more an either-or attribute of being a car.  Talking about &quot;Coupes&quot;, &quot;Sedans&quot;, &quot;wagons&quot;, &quot;minivans&quot;, etc. is a better top-level organization.  While being four- or two- door is perhaps common or universally found in some styles and not others, it's not really a good top-level organization in exactly the same way ales and lagers are not good top level categories for beer.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:129.46.148.232|129.46.148.232]] ([[User talk:129.46.148.232|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/129.46.148.232|contribs]]) 01:04, 1 November 2005 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;

Alright so I've sort of taken it upon myself to fix up this page.  I agree that this shouldn't strive to be just another dictionary. (at least not at this point)  Right now I'm adding some instruction.  You can't learn a language with just a dictionary, although it's kind of hard without it.  I'm gonna email a few people who run online ASL dictionaries and see if I can link directly to their definitions. (or maybe they'll even let us put some stuff of this site, who knows?) Any help would be greatly appreciated. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 07:04, 24 October 2005 (UTC)

:Hi, I'm working on the French Sign Language wikibook.  I think this is a unique opportunity to build something really different -- not just a dictionary, but an actual manual of ASL (or LSF in my case).  In case you are geographically close enough to talk to anybody who could donate material, I've made a demo of the LSF wiki that you can transport on laptop.  This is useful for showing people directly exactly what we're trying to do, and really driving home the point that we're not trying to just build a dictionary.  If you want, I can send you the zip file.  Otherwise, if you have any other ideas on how we could collaborate, please let me know.  Cheers, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:52, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:Another note: videos on wikimedia projects have to be in the (free) ogg theora format.  I might be of some tech assistance on that end.  If you are a programmer, we might be able to work together to produce a user friendly video converter so that more people can get their ASL stuff online -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 21:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

::Alright! I can't believe someone is actually interested in helping me out on this.  I figured the popularity of sign language would be minimal to say the least.  Go ahead and email me the zip at genericdave AT hotmail.com (just be sure to post here once you have so I know to check it)  I would love to see your ideas.  As for the video stuff we could theoretically tape the stuff ourselves but I'd like to venture a few other directions first.  --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 23:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

::Oh, and I'd also like to suggest that instead of videos we could possibly use animated images (are gifs allowed on wikipedia?)  --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 23:50, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:::Worth considering.  Do you mean animated drawings? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:41, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

::::I mean basic picture animations so visitors will not have to have any sort of fancy plugins to view the pictures in site.  You can also check out how [http://www.lifeprint.com/ this guy] does it.  Getting any sort of dictionary up would be quite the undertaking.  We might be able to convince one of the owners of the other online dictionaries to let us link to some of their stuff for words that we use in examples and such.  Then again, there's no hurry to get this done or anything, and it's not like there's a big demand, so I see no reason why such a colossal undertaking should be ruled out.  By the way, I looked at the zip you sent me, good stuff.  I'll see about actually getting some information up before I worry about structure though.  I have a ASL midterm coming up here so I probably won't update much for a little while. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 11:19, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Interesting.  Commons *does* seem accept gif images, so it'd be an interesting thing to try out.  I have some doubts -- it might be very large and it might be too choppy to be useful -- but the only way to know for sure is to try it out.  

Otherwise, I think that the picture-strip format (i.e. the lifeprint approach you showed me) is a good complement to regular video.  Video for people who want to see the sign in motion (rhythm, etc).  Picture strip for those who want to get an idea at a glance (no need to keep going back and forth) or to print things out.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 00:08, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

:Yeah you've got the basic idea.  I just hate sites that force people to install particular software in order to view anything.  I guess it would be pretty cool to have multiple kinds of examples in the dictionary.  Oh yeah and by the way, sorry if I'm slow on updating for the next few weeks.  Quarter's coming to an end here and school has a way of sneaking up on ya.  Like I said I'm planning on doing this but it's gonna be slow. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 02:38, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

::I understand :-) that's one of the things I like about this project.  It's impressive to see what people can do with the precious spare time they have.  I also understand the point about forcing people to install particular software.  But that's related to the reason why we are using the Ogg Theora format (see [[meta:Video policy]]).  It's the only free format around, the only thing that prevents us from being at the mercy of any one vendor.  Only problem is that it's very much a minority in the real world, hence the &quot;special&quot; software.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:00, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== GordKnot ==

Hey guys.  I don't know ASL, but I'm hoping to begin studying this summer.  Very glad to see this book getting some attention; as you stated above, there are many dictionaries online, but no lexicons and no grammars.  If you want any help on the technical end (converting or editing video, etc), let me know.  Also, I cue a bit (slowly - still working on that); would it be appropriate to put a page on CS in here, just as a &quot;here's one alternative that some Deaf use&quot;?  I don't have a Wiki account, but you can email me at gordknot@gmail.com -- GordKnot 19:35 10 December 2005 (UTC)

:Hey, welcome to the project!  You might consider creating an account so that we can interact more easily.    It's pretty painless: name, password, password (verification) and click the &quot;Create New Account&quot; button.  Here are some ideas on how to help the project along:
:* Can you do any computer programming? -- it would be great if we could make it easier for non-technical users to get their video into ogg format.  If we could have a graphical utility, or somehow integrate an anything-to-ogg converter into the wikipedia uploader, it would seriously move the project along.
:* Do you know anybody who teaches ASL?  See if you can get them to participate in the project, and/or donate course materials to the site.  I have a demonstrator that you can [http://eric.kow.free.fr/download/LSFwikiDemo.zip download] and carry around on a laptop.  It might be a useful way to show people what we're trying to accomplish.  
:Also, I think a &lt;s&gt;page of&lt;/s&gt; wikibook on cued speech would be very useful.  You might stir up some political issues, but wikimedia projects are very used to handling controversy, so we'll be ok :-) Please feel free to dive right in, put whatever content you think would be useful, change things, and generally be bold.  It's what makes this project work. Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:03, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

''Rather than composing another online American Sign Language (ASL) Dictionary, the goal of this page is to be a resource of various online ASL Dictionaries''
:Aw come on, we can do better than that! (N.B. I'm not an ASL speaker).  One thing I've always found frustrating about ASL books I see in the stores is that they almost always consist of dictionaries.  What about grammar?  How about we try to fill the gap?  Provide something that teaches people how to speak ASL, beyond a list of words, but how to manipulating things like Classifiers, Role, etc?  Check out the French Sign Language book (http://fr.wikibooks.org/wiki/LSF).  We in the LSF wiki community haven't had time to put anything really substantial together, but at least we're aiming high, and hopefully, little by little, we'll get there.  Don't you think there's room for collaboration on some real, '''useful''' sign language resources? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:47, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)


There's a lot more to ASL than simply knowing the signs.  Sentences are not formed the same way they are in American English.  I might take the time to add a bit of info about how to put the signs together at a later date. -- [[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]]

:Alright that's it.  I'm gonna completely revamp this thing.  I'm not gonna attempt another online dictionary (at least not at this point) but I'll definitely add some grammatical stuff. --[[User:Genericdave|Genericdave]] 23:14, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[WB:WIW]] ==

ASL dictionaries and directories of websites are '''[[WB:WIN|not]]''' acceptable content. I've started an outline, and transwikied some content from Wikipedia. I hope to contribute more, but reverting to any of these previous conceptions of what the book might be would likely result in deletion.

I suggest a book about [[w:Sign language in infants and toddlers|Sign language in infants and toddlers]] --[[Special:Contributions/193.145.201.52|193.145.201.52]] ([[User talk:193.145.201.52|talk]]) 10:32, 14 October 2008 (UTC)

== Formating and making this book a book ==

If someone wants to work on the transwiki stuff I can help out with the formating. Also the pages need to be more book like. The idea is that this is going to be a pdf file and a text book for people to learn from. Pictures are fine but lets not have anything that moves around and can't be printed, eh?
We can put the moving stuff on wikimedia or something.
:Why would you avoid using video? Wikibooks isn't paper (luckily). I'd be happy to perform imports as needed - just let me know what's needed. Besides that, I can help with organization. However, I'm not able to take on much of an author role at the moment. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:17, 4 January 2009 (UTC)

== To Do ==

Pasted from the front page of this wikibook:
*[[/Grammar 1/]] is a de-wikified version of [[w:American Sign Language grammar]] which needs to be split up into the various grammar lessons.
*[[Transwiki:American Sign Language]] needs to be split into multiple modules: [[/History/]], [[/Simple Sentences 1/]]...
*[[Transwiki:Deaf culture]] needs to be split into multiple modules [[/Deaf Culture/]], [[/History/]], [[/Dialogue 1/]]...
*[[Transwiki:Bimodal bilingualism]] needs to be split into [[/Deaf Culture/]], [[/History/]].
*[[Transwiki:Deafness#Children of deaf adults]] can be merged into [[/Deaf Culture/]].
*[[Transwiki:Profanity in American sign language]] can be added towards the end of the book and reworked as a lesson.
*[[Transwiki:Two-handed manual alphabet]] can be added as an advanced lesson regarding combined hearing-vision impairments

If there are no protests, I would like to start a '''[[American Sign Language/Under Development|sandbox]]''' of sorts to develop a different approach for this wikibook. It will be a slow process, as I would like to gather images and make the lesson plans balance grammar learning with vocabulary introduction, and exercises. Help would be greatly appreciated, as my knowledge of ASL is basic at the moment. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 06:09, 27 February 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Add INA website ==

Michael Foster noted:

Professor Cziko &amp; John:

The French website to which you alluded is the site for the National Audiovisual Institute in France that opened up its archives and released around 100,000 film, tv and radio clips for public use. Their website is:

http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php

I haven't used it for class yet, but there are lots of interesting historical and cultural documents that can make class and research more interesting.



== Spanish podcasts ==

Janet said:

I have just began listening to podcasts in Spanish and it is a great way to improve listening skills and understanding! I definitely am going to start using this resource on a more regular basis.  In addition, I like how I can subscribe to a podcast and then have itunes automatically download the most recent podcasts; that way, I don't have to worry about tuning in to a specific radio show at a specific time, for example, because podcasts are available at all times of the day.  Recently, I have been listening to ABC news in Spanish which I definitely reccomend because it is a great resource for staying in tune to what's going on in the world, and the announcer does not speak very fast so it is easier to understand.  Hopefully other learners find this helpful!

== English podcasts ==

Jing said:
For me, listening has been the most difficult part when learning English. During the days preparing for my TOEFL test,I found some useful on-line radio website whhich was really helpful for me.

Earth and Sky
http://www.earthsky.org/shows/
It provides numerous information relating to science and nature by interviewing with scientists each day. EFL learners can listen to every topic they are interested in by clicking the specific date. Moreover, each topic has complete script and related link on-line.

Also, it you found science is boring and too advanced, you can use this website, which was designed for learners of different levels. It is quite helpful for me on listening skill.

http://www.esl-lab.com/
It includes various conversation topics of our daily life. For me, when I feel that the content is more familiar with me, I can understand the context easier.
Also, it has vocabulary quizz followed by each conversation, vocabulary learning tips, and long conversation with realy video. And if you want to prepare for the TOEFL test, it has academic lecture, too.

I haven't tried podcast before. In fact, it's my first time hear about podcast. Maybe I will find more useful resourse there by the end of this course.

== Google in searches in selected languages and countries ==

It is possible to use the Google search engine restricted to a selected language or to sites from a particuar country. Usually you add the country code after google, so that, for example, google.fr give you the French Google. Some codes that work for Google are:
*France http://google.fr
*German http://google.de
*Switerzland http://google.ch
*Canada http://google.ca
*Spain http://google.es


I suppose there are many others and there must be a directory of these somewhere.

{{wikipedia}}
'''Apprentice carpenters''' are paid trainees who are learning to construct and repair structures of wood, plywood, and wallboard. They attend formal classes and work under experienced carpenters on the job to learn their craft. Carpenters work on residential as well as commercial buildings. 

Once the apprenticeship is complete, the person gains the title of journey person and can begin searching for work for themselves.

'''Duties:''' As residential or construction carpenters, apprentices may perform some or all of these basic duties: 

* Read plans, blueprints, or instructions 
* Identify and find materials 
* Determine size/shape of the required parts 
* Measure and mark materials for cutting 
* Cut and shape materials using hand or power tools 
* Erect forms, wood framework, sub-flooring, sheeting, partitions, floor joists, studding, and rafters 
* Install trim, wood paneling, cabinets, windows, doors, hardware, and flooring 
* Check accuracy with levels, rules, plumb bobs, and framing squares and make any necessary adjustments

The carpenter who builds commercial buildings usually builds forms and places structural steel in forms. Commercial building carpenters also do many activities similar to those of residential carpenters. 

'''Working Conditions:''' The normal work week for an apprentice carpenter is 40 hours. As in other building trades, carpentry requires prolonged standing, climbing, bending, and kneeling. The job may be indoors or outdoors, at floor level, or on ladders or scaffolding. Carpenters employed outside the construction industry may perform a variety of installation and maintenance work.

'''Wages:''' The typical apprentice earns around 50%-70% of the standard wages for a journey-person. Apprentice wages increase as the person gains more experience.

== Carpentry Projects==
Woodworking plans for constructing cabinets, chairs, shelves, and other objects typically created by carpenters.

Thermodynamics is the study of the changes in energy that occur in reactions.

==Systems==
A '''system''' is the set of substances and energy that is being studied.  If, for example, reactions are occurring in a jar, everything inside the jar is the system, and everything outside the jar is the '''surroundings'''.  The surroundings are everything not in the system, which means the rest of the universe. The system and the surroundings together are called the &quot;universe&quot;.

One important issue is what kind of interactions exist between the system and its surroundings. Some systems may exchange matter and heat with the surroundings (like a system of boiling liquid losing matter and heat with the vapor). This is called an '''open system'''.  If there is just heat exchange occurring between the system and its surroundings it is called a '''closed system'''.  No matter can enter or leave a closed system.  And, finally, if there is no exchange of heat and no exchange of matter, the system is completely '''isolated'''.

==Temperature vs. Heat==
If you put a hot iron pot under cold water, it cools down very quickly. This is because iron has a low '''specific heat''', which is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius (or Kelvin). Solid iron only requires 0.45 J/(g*K), while liquid water holds about nine times as much energy (heat) per degree (temperature). So when water receives energy from the pot, it only warms up by a few degrees, while the pot cools down substantially.

{{Yellow Warning|'''Temperature''' is the measure of the kinetic energy of a particle. '''Heat''' is energy, measured in joules (J).  There is a very big difference between the two.}}

==Thermochemical Equations==
Equations don't just show chemicals; they also show how much energy is required or released. This energy is called '''enthalpy'''. There are two ways to write a thermochemical reaction, for example:

*&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + 571.6\ kJ&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} \quad (\Delta H = -285.8~kJ)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the number is negative in the second format. Also, notice how the first equation has double the energy because there are two moles of water.  The second equation shows the amount of heat ''per mole'', so the number of moles does not affect it.

From a thermochemical reaction, one can tell the '''molar heat of formation''' of a compound. Usually, this is measured at 25°C, and is written as ΔH&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;°. It is the amount of heat required to make one mole of the substance.  The small ° symbol means &quot;standard&quot;, as in Standard Temperature and Pressure.

'''Molar heat of combustion''' is the opposite of the molar heat of formation. It measures the amount of energy released when a mole of the compound is burned. It is written as ΔH&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;°.

{{Info|In thermochemistry, if a reaction takes multiple steps, the heats from each reaction are simply added or subtracted. This is known as '''Hess's Law'''.}}

== Internatinal recogniton ==

How about mentioning Wikiversity's degrees international recognition.

:Dear Reader, are you okay? If the issue is the international recognition, perhaps you could add something to the suggested page on [[A free and internationally recognised university]]? If you need a *hug*, it's okay to ask for one. I've been through a lot too, and I know how it can feel sometimes. love, [[User:Makiaea|makiaea]] 19:28, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pencils ==
There are various grades of pencils.  In a range of soft 8B to very hard 9H.

* Dark, heavy lines are drawn with High &quot;B&quot; numbered pencils.
* Fine, light lines are drawn with High &quot;H&quot; numbered pencils.
* F and HB are in the middle range.
* General usage is HB, F or 2H in carpentry.

== Chalk Line ==
Chalk line tools are used to mark straight lines, generally over long distances.  A chalk line may also be referred to as a &quot;chalk box&quot;, as this is also descriptive of the hand tools!

===Description===
Most chalk line tools consist of a string, usually with a hook on one end, that is wound around a spindle that is inside a box or container that contains powdered chalk of various colors.  Colors of chalk that are generally available, but not limited to, are blue (most common), red, yellow and orange.

===Use===
To use a chalk line, the free end of the string (usually with a hook) is pulled from the box.  The free end is then either hooked onto an object, such as the edge of a board or a nail, or is held by an assistant.  The container end of the chalk line is then taken to the other end of the object to be marked.  Both ends of the string are then placed over pre-measured marks and pulled taut.  The string is pulled away from the object to be marked and released, transferring a chalk line from the string to the object.  This may be repeated several times to mark additional lines before the string must be returned to the box to have additional chalk applied to it.  Note that care must be taken when snapping lines - if the stringline is pulled away in a direction not perpendicular to the face of the object, the snapped line will curve. Also, snapping across a hump or dip may cause distortions in the desired line. Snapping lines in wet weather can be problematic. In the worst conditions you can replace the cotton line with twisted nylon of the same dimension and then use concrete dye (powder) instead of chalk, adding water to the box,mixing and draining excess. Then flick excess dye from string before snapping and quickly lifting the line from the surface. Puddles should be swept away before using this method.

==Scratch Awl==

===Description===
A scratch awl is basically a strong metal pointer with a handle.

===Use===

A scratch awl is used for marking on materials which do not readily take pencil or chalk marks.  A line is scratched into the material with the awl.  

Another common use is to make a small indentation in wood, etc. into which a nail or screw is placed, or a drill bit aligned prior to predrilling a properly aimed hole for the nail or screw.  To make the biggest indentation in the least time:
# push awl-point straight down against the surface
# wiggle it to and fro in one direction
# wiggle it rotary-wise
# repeat the last two steps in sequence a time or two as needed.

====With wired-cardboard crafts====

When boxes are to be repaired or signs or other structures built by wiring together sections of cardboard, one may use the awl to create holes at the right positions on fitting pieces of cardboard prior to placing them together, or match the pieces together first and while holding or clamping them tightly together, make the first holes (often two) just prior to inserting and twist-tying wires to a desired secure tightness.

====Solid core telephone wire====
The type of wire most easily used is the kind found in telephone cables since World War II, with a solid copper wire inside any of ten colors of plastic sheathing which brings the outer diameter to about 1-mm.  This wire, sometimes in cables of 50 or 100, may be found discarded in dumpsters when business buildings are demolished, or intercepted on the way to a &quot;recycler&quot; (they only trash the plastic and melt down the copper for recasting at the cost of energy; an effort should be made to save this fine crafts resource, placing reuse ahead of &quot;recycling&quot;). 

====Multi-awl====
This tool is made by wirebraiding a big 2&quot; safety pin, by its foothole, to the handle of a regular awl.  Use this pin to make holes in tough cardboard, large enough to admit one telephone wire, or to start holes which are then easily widened by the regular awl point, usually wide enough to admit four telephone wires or one conduit-size wire (3-mm.).

===Liquid marker===
This is usually the easiest tool for marking pieces of carpentry wood and other varied materials.  The Sanford Sharpie and its million Asiatic imitators have a point of about the right sharpness for marking where cuts will be made, a support bar placed, etc.  Where many holes are due to be drilled, one may carefully mark all the locations first with a Sharpie, then dig pilot pits with an awl, then drill all the holes.

'''Gravy''' is a [[Cookbook:sauce|sauce]] made from the rendered fat and juices of an animal thickened with [[Cookbook:flour|flour]] or [[Cooking:cornstarch|cornstarch]]. Commonly, some of the fat is skimmed off before thickening. The thickener may be included in a proprietary gravy powder, which includes caramel (burnt sugar)  to colour it brown, and salt. 

Colour may also be added as &quot;browning&quot;, a caramel solution in water. Gravy can be flavoured with herbs and seasonings or a proprietary meat stock may be added. Poultry gravy is usually lighter in colour than gravies to accompany red meat. Gravy is usually served from a small jug called a gravy boat. 

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cooking]], a '''gravy''' is a [[Cookbook:curry|curry]] sauce.

In Italian-American cooking, gravy refers to a rich, tomato-based meat sauce.

'''Lassi''' are [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]-based shakes in either sweet or salted flavors. The most common flavors include [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]], [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rose water]], and plain [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] sweetened lassi. Lassis originate from India.

==Traditional salty (''namkin'') lassi==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (1 [[Cookbook:Liter|L]]) [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 3 c (750 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) cold water
* 1 c (250 mL) crushed ice
* fresh green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] (quantity according to taste), chopped
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], roasted and ground 
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice 
* 2 tsp salt

Combine all ingredients except ice in blender and blend until smooth. Then add ice and continue blending until frothy.

==Mild salty lassi==

Here is one possible recipe for a Salty Lassi:

* 250 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]) full-fat [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 250 mL (1 cup) chilled [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (4[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 2 teaspoons lime or lemon juice 
* ½ - 1 teaspoon (2-4g) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 100 mL (½ cup) ice cubes
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] (finely crumbled, dried; optional)
* small pinch of [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] (optional)

Dry-roast cumin seeds by cooking them over low heat in small pan until you can smell the seasoning, about 2 to 3 minutes. Cool and grind. In blender, blend cumin seed powder with yoghurt, milk, lemon juice, salt and ice cubes. Optionally scatter with crumbled mint, and a small pinch of cayenne if for piquancy. Serve chilled. (4 servings)

==Sweet (''mithi'') lassi==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (1 [[Cookbook:Litre|L]]) [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 3 c (750 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) cold water
* 1 c (250 mL) crushed ice
* 6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] ground [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]
* few drops [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

Combine all ingredients except ice in [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] and blend until smooth. Then add ice and continue blending until frothy.

==Sweet mango lassi==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Litre|L]] (4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]] nectar
* 500 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (2 cups) full-fat [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]
* 500 mL (2 cups) chilled [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 250 mL (1 cup) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

Mix sugar with the mango nectar until dissolved. Next, gradually add the milk to the yoghurt. Finally, mix together the two resulting mixtures. (6 servings)

==Other countries==

===Papaya (Pawpaw) Lassi===

*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] water
*4 cups plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
*⅔ cup [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Papaya|papaya]] pulp
*½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

Put everything in a blender. Blend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Fencing (sport)}}
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels, from students learning at a university to professional and Olympic competition. The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling another. 

These duels usually take place at tournaments. The early rounds of a competition which establish seeding for the final round will usually be &quot;five touch&quot; bouts, meaning the first fencer to score five touches on the other fencer wins the bout. From the first round fencers will be seeded and the knockout round of the competition will commence.  In this it is normal to fence until the first fencer reaches 15.  However both the seeding round or rounds and the final will have a time constraint and so a bout may finish without the full number of points scored.  The winner is then the fencer with the highest score.

What defines a touch is dependent on the style of fencing and the weapons used. The three primary weapons are the foil, the épée, and the sabre.

==Foil Fencing==

The foil is the lightest of the three weapons. It will be the weapon that most instructors will expect students to master before they move to any other weapon.  

With the foil, touches may be scored on the torso (groin to neck), with the point only.  With the épée, touches may be scored on any part of the body.  With the saber, touches may be scored with the point or the blade.  The target area is the body from hips to head.

Foil fencing introduces the concept of 'right of way.'  An attacker must establish right of way before scoring a valid point. One establishes right of way by extending the blade in a straight line toward the opponent's target area.  Until the opponent is able to regain right of way, he/she is on the defensive.  Right of way can be gained by parrying (redirecting the opponent's thrust) outside the target area and then extending one's own blade toward the opponent.  This counter-attack is termed a 'riposte.'  A fencing point often consists of an attack, a riposte, a counter-riposte, and further counter-ripostes in series until a point is scored.  Reflecting the dueling origins of modern (European) fencing, action stops after a valid touch and the fencers return to their original position at the center of the strip.

==Sabre Fencing==
In modern sabre, which is modeled after the cavalry sabre, touches are scored with hits to the head, torso and arms (hands and groin are specifically not target though). Sabre is a slashing weapon, therefore the edge of the blade is generally used to score points, though the point can be used also. This weapon is also governed by the rules of right-of-way, interpreted in the same way as the foil.

The sabre tends to be the fastest and most athletic of the three modern weapons. Fencers engage each other very quickly and the engagements rarely go beyond a few actions. Sabre fencers have had to adapt their tactics to a semi-recent rule that forbids them to bring the rear foot forward of the front. This prevents a type of attack called the fleche, which is a combination of a leap and a run. Fencers have adapted by creating the &quot;flunge,' which is essentially jumping at your opponent. Many sabre matches consist of the two fencers leaping at each other, the weapon is dominated by the quickest and most effective motions.

==Epee Fencing==

Epee is the heaviest of the three weapons and beginners, used to foil, often find this an issue in moving to this weapon.  The lack of right-of-way rule also requires unlearning.

Epee fencing is a bit of a departure from foil and sabre fencing. Epee was created as a reaction to foil fencing with the idea of creating a competition more like a &quot;real&quot; duel. The rules are modeled after the French practice of dueling to first blood drawn; touches may be scored anywhere on the body. Because no system exists for establishing the priority of an attack, both fencers may score a point simultaneously, called a 'double-touch,' as long as the hits arrive within .5 seconds of each other.

Épée tactics differ significantly from those of foil and sabre. Because the arm is also target (it is, in  fact, the primary target) fencers stay further away from each other. Épée also tends to rely less on the parry-riposte because there is no need to establish priority. While parry-riposte is still used, counterattacks are used far more frequently instead. Fencers in épée also tend to rely on deeper strategies because of the slower, more defensive nature.

Before one can keep bees one obviously must have access to bees. There exist several methods for obtaining bees, the most common include getting bees in the form [[#Packaged Bees|packages]], [[#Nucs (nucleus hives)|nucs]], [[#Established Hives|established hives]], [[#Swarm Baiting|baiting for swarms]], from [[#Swarm Capture|swarm or capturing]] and finally by [[#Collecting Feral Hives|collecting a feral hives]].

==Packaged Bees==
In the United States packaged bees most often come from the southern warmer states, namely California, Texas and Florida. Packaged bees can often be shipped anywhere within the continental US though it may be cheaper to have a large number trucked to the desired region and have the packages distributed. Packages are in high demand as the season progresses, so it is often best to reserve the desired number of packages early on during the winter or previous fall. If an option is given, it is best to have the packages delivered so that they arrive around the time of the first bloom.
Packages are usually made available in three, four or five pound increments. For a single new hive a three-pound package of bees with a queen should be sufficient. However if desired four or five pound package can be split to make two hives, just be sure to purchase an extra queen.
Packages can be acquired from many sources and be individually be composed of differing [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races|races]] of bees. If possible it is advised to do some research when purchasing packages. There exist many [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources#Package Dealers|resources]] to acquire packages, some advertise in beekeeping [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources#Journals|journals]], others simply by word of mouth. Be sure to know what you are buying and don’t get lured in by possibly false claims. &lt;br&gt;
If you decide to go with a package be sure to learn how to [[Beekeeping/Care for a Package| care for a package of bees]] and how to [[Beekeeping/Hive a Package| hive a package]]. Also be sure you know how to [[Beekeeping/Handling Queens| handle the queen]] and [[Beekeeping/Introducing Queens| introduce the queen]] to a new package.

==Nucs (nucleus hives)==

Nucs, or nucleus hives, are in essence small self-supporting hives. Though not good for collecting extra honey, or hardy to long-term poor weather conditions, nucs make for a good way to establish new full-sized hives. Nucs often contain three to five drawn frames, but it is not unheard of to have ten full frames. One of the major benefits of nucs over packaged bees is that they should already contain a laying queen and a somewhat established colony. However, nucs cannot be transported anywhere near as easily as packaged bees and are often more expensive. Nucs can also harbor disease and pests; because of this, be sure to inspect the nuc and get its history prior to purchase. Whenever possible it may be a good idea to contact your state bee inspector prior to purchasing a nuc. &lt;br&gt;
If you find that a Nuc is how you wish to start a hive, check out information on [[Beekeeping/Moving Hives| moving hives]] and [[Beekeeping/Hiving a Nuc| hiving nucs]].

*Don’t integrate well to non-Langstroth-style hives
|}

==Established Hives==

Established hives are exactly what their name implies, a fully working established hive. The upside of an established hive is that it gets to work as soon as it is placed in its new location. However, it has many of the same down falls that a nuc has, and a large hive can be rather intimidating to a novice beekeeper.
Established hives can often be acquired rather easily from retiring beekeepers; the trick is finding out before anyone else does. Other equipment may also come cheaply from such a source. Some of the best ways to find out about such a deal are by keeping in contact with your local [[Beekeeping/Beekeeping Clubs|club]], by browsing the classified ads within beekeeping [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources#Journals|journals]], and by reading local beekeeping newsletters. &lt;br&gt;
If you are thinking about going with an established hive rather than starting your own, be sure you know how to properly [[Beekeeping/Moving Hives| move a hive]].

==Swarm Baiting==

Baiting swarm traps may or may not be a successful or first-rate system for acquiring bees. Depending on the time of year captured, a swarm may not be able to sustain itself through winter; therefore, it may be best to only bait traps early within the swarm season. Whereas there is the plus that your bees would be free of charge, you may simply be acquiring more trouble than it is worth. Swarms may be of inferior stock or even [[Beekeeping/Africanized Honey Bee|africanized]]. Because of this it may not be a wise idea to capture swarms through baiting. &lt;br&gt;
However, if you still feel confident with the idea of trapping a swarm, you may wish to learn [[Beekeeping/Swarm Baiting| how to trap a swarm]] and how to [[Beekeeping/Swarm Hiving| hive a swarm]].

|}

==Swarm Capture==

Swarms are natural occurrences for bees. Swarm capture was the original way in which beekeepers would increase the size of their apiary. Swarm capture, however, is not recommended for a novice beekeeper. Capturing a swarm can prove to be quite tricky for someone who has not had any experience working with bees. Many of the same down sides exist with swarm capture as there does with swarm trapping.
It is best to only capture swarms if you know where they originated. Sometimes your own bees may swarm or the bees of another beekeeper, these are often the prime swarms to capture. Some residential areas even have a swarm notification list in which keepers can be added and notified when some one spots a swarm. However, be aware many people believe any collection of swarming insects to be bees, so false alarms may be commonplace. &lt;br&gt;
If you still feel positive towards swarm capture, you may wish to learn [[Beekeeping/Swarms Catching| how to capture swarms]] and how to [[Beekeeping/Swarm Hiving| hive it]] once you have it.

*Can, but not necessarily, lead to being badly stung

==Collecting Feral Hives==

Feral hive collection may be the most labor intensive and dangerous way to acquire bees. First year beekeepers should not perform such task, in fact many veteran beekeepers won’t even dismantle a feral hive in order to acquire bees. Feral hives can be found within hollow trees, large flowerpots, and house walls or even hanging from trees or other such locations. Because the hive is established, capturing a colony almost always requires destroying its surroundings, causing the bees within to become very irritated. This should not be done without full [[Beekeeping/Protective Gear| Protective Gear]]. Any damages done to property may be the responsibility of the collector, so be sure to sign a contract before extracting bees.&lt;br&gt;
Collecting a feral hive is no easy task, but if you decide to take that route be sure you are familiar with the process of [[Beekeeping/Collecting Feral Hives| collecting a feral hive]] and know how to [[Beekeeping/Hiving Feral Hives| hive it]].

==Introduction to Aspect==
For most native speakers of English (and indeed of many other languages) one of the most difficult tasks in learning Russian is learning to cope with the complexity of Russian verbs.  Unlike, say, Spanish and German, where the great difficulty lies in memorizing the many forms of verbs (much more than the Russian system), the difficulty in Russian is in coming to understand a property inherent to each verb: aspect.

All verbs in Russian have an aspect. Some verbs exist in aspectual pairs, but certainly not most of them. In the case of an aspectual pair, one word is the imperfective aspect of that verb, and the other is the perfective aspect. Very roughly, the difference is that the imperfective aspect is used when the action is incomplete, while the perfective aspect is used when the action ''is'' complete.
Rather than expound more theory here, we shall proceed by considering an example. Let us take the verbs &quot;to speak&quot; (imperfective: '''говори́ть''', perfective: '''сказа́ть''') and &quot;to do&quot; (imper.: '''де́лать''', per.: '''сде́лать'''). Consider these example sentences that use ''imperfective'' aspects:

:Misha, what were you doing after lunch? - '''Мишa, что ты ''де́лал'' после обеда?'''
:I was talking to Katya - '''Я ''говори́л'' с Катей'''

Note that the verbs here describe a process.  It is also possible to consider this as a complete action, but as written the concern is not with whether the action is complete, but simply what was happening.  The first speaker wondered what Misha was doing after lunch.  The first speaker could be Misha's boss, wondering why he was not at his desk. Now, let's consider the same sentences with ''perfective'' aspects:

:Misha, what did you do after lunch? - '''Миша, что ты ''сде́лал'' после обеда?'''
:I told my mother about my grades - '''Я ''сказа́л'' мое́й маме об отметках'''

In this example, it's the outcome of the action that is of importance.  The first speaker could be Misha's father, wondering why his mother was so upset when he arrived home from work.

== Forming aspectual pairs ==
So, verbs in Russian have two words: an ''imperfective'' and a ''perfective'' aspect. For example, 'to speak' is both '''говорить''' (imperfective) and '''сказать''' (perfective). Can we predict the form of one aspect if we know the other? Does every verb even have a pair of aspects?  Almost always, the answer is a definite 'yes'; take, for instance, '''делать/сделать''' both mean 'to do' or 'to make', and the latter is clearly the former with a prefix - most perfective verbs are simply their imperfective counterpart with a prefix.

=== Prefixes and the perfectives ===
Many verbs come in pairs like '''делать/сделать''', with the perfective variant simply being the imperfective with a prefix. For instance, '''написать''' is the perfective of '''писать''' ('to write'), '''посмотреть''' is the perfective of '''смотреть''' ('to watch'), and we've already seen the imperfective '''делать''' and the perfective '''сделать''' ('to do'). For such verbs, the aspectual pair will often be given in dictionaries as a prefix indicated in parentheses: '''(с)делать, (по)смотреть, (на)писать''', etc. Such pairs of aspects are easy to learn, as the perfective also conjugates the same as the imperfective, only with a prefix.

However, one has to be careful with prefixes. While the perfective can be formed by a prefix, other prefixes can be applied to an imperfective to make a whole new verbal pair. For instance, we can add the prefix '''от''' to the imperfective '''говорить''' to make the new perfective '''отговорить''', meaning 'to dissuade'. From this, we can derive a new imperfective aspect, '''отговаривать'''. Another aspectual pair we can derive from '''говорить''' is '''договариваться''' (impf.) and '''договориться''' (perf.), meaning &quot;to agree&quot;. So we have three pairs derived using prefixes:
: '''говорить''' (impf.) and '''сказать''' (pf.)
: '''отговаривать''' (impf.) and '''отговорить''' (pf.)
: '''договариваться''' (impf.) and '''договориться''' (pf.)
In other words, the easiest way to remember aspectual pairs is to learn the imperfective and learn the 'perfective prefix'. The prefix itself is largely unpredictable (the most common is '''по-''', and others are '''про-''', '''на-''', '''за-''', etc), not all verbs form their perfective aspect with a prefix, and some prefixes can create whole new verbs.

=== Other ways to predict aspect ===
Is there any other way to predict whether a new word is perfective or imperfective? Yes: if it contains '''-ыва-''', it is almost certainly ''imperfective'', and the corresponding perfective is the same word without the '''-ыв-'''.
: '''опаздывать''' (impf.) and '''опоздать''' (pf.) - 'to be late'
: '''рассказывать''' (impf.) and '''рассказать''' (pf.) - 'to tell, recount'
As ever, exceptions are plentiful, such as '''покупать''' (impf.) and '''купить''' (pf.) - 'to buy'.

=== Multi-aspect verbs ===
Rarely, some verbs have more than two aspects; for example, '''читать''', '''прочитать''', and '''почитать''' all mean 'to read'.  The first is the standard imperfective, and means simply 'to read'. The second verb shown, '''прочитать''', is the standard perfective aspectual partner of '''читать''', but also more specifically means, 'to read an entire work'.  The last verb, '''почитать''', is also perfective, and so also describes a complete action. However, its more specific meaning is, 'to read for some period of time' or 'to read for a while'. Fortunately, these are rare, and only really occur in verbs of motion.

=== Unpredictable pairs ===
Some verbs have unpredictable pairs of aspects, such as:
:'''говорить''' (impf.) and '''сказать''' (pf.) - 'to say, speak, tell'
:'''брать''' (impf.) and '''взять''' (pf.) - 'to take, get, obtain'

Finally, there are a few verbs that do not have an aspectual partner, such as '''быть''' (pf., 'to be').

==Why must I endure this?==
In short, all of this is to say that there are two types of verbs in Russian, perfective verbs, and imperfective verbs.  Perfective verbs carry the meaning of complete action, while imperfective verbs carry the meaning of a process or state.  When choosing a verb to utter, it is important to choose a verb of the proper aspect.  

Beyond the semantic difference, there is a formal difference that you will see when studying verb conjugation and tense formation.  Namely, while perfective and imperfective verbs can appear in the past or in the future, only imperfective verbs can appear in the present tense.  What happens if you try to make a present-tense form of a perfective verb?  You get a perfective verb with future meaning.  Imperfective verbs are put into the future tense by another mechanism (in fact, by a mechanism much more like that used in English -- namely, the use of a helping verb).  This may seem like a rather odd way to handle things, and perhaps it is.  In any case, Russians don't seem to mind.  The reason, for those of us who like to believe there are reasons for these things, is that a complete action cannot occur &quot;now&quot;.  At the instant we call &quot;now&quot;, a complete action must either have already been completed, or remain to be completed.  &quot;Now&quot; can only point to the process of an action.

==In conclusion==
Verbal aspect is a very important feature of Russian, and should be considered (consciously or otherwise) whenever a Russian verb is encountered or is to be rendered.  If you consider aspect each time you encounter a verb, it won't take long to get a good feel for aspect.  As for producing Russian in writing or in speech, this is one more thing to think about before you open the gates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">New Zealand was settled by Polynesian voyagers over a period extending from about AD 800 to 1300. They had no written language, as far as anyone knows, but had and still have a rich oral tradition where everyone learned about his or her ancestry.

After European contact they came to be known as the &quot;Maori&quot; people, with the same word applied to all mainland dialects of their language and to the closely related language of the Cook Islands.

In 1642 a Dutch expedition under Abel Tasman &quot;discovered&quot; the country, mapping some of its west coast. The country's current name is an Anglicised version of a name Dutch cartographers applied to it. Tasman's name is applied to a few features such as a large bay (one of the earliest he visited) and a glacier (which he was never near).

The next visit from Europeans was much more detailed. In 1769, after observing a Transit of Venus from Tahiti, Englishman James Cook brought his expedition south on the strength of secret Government orders to look for southern lands to colonise. Sailing west, he reached the Gisborne area and ended up circumnavigating the whole country and encouraging his scientists to make detailed studies of flora and fauna. He claimed it for Britain. His name is commemorated in the highest mountaintop, the strait between the two main islands, and a number of other places.

Whalers and sealers were the main visitors over the next few decades. In the early 19th century, Europeans brought to the natives a variety of new things such as Christianity, writing, disease, and muskets, and a few traders set up trading posts or became farmers.

In 1840, the same year as some planned settlements (e.g. Wellington) took place, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between the representatives of Queen Victoria of Great Britain (just 4 days before her wedding) and leaders of the Maori people, who were given the status and protection of British subjects in return for officially allowing the British to settle and to buy land and to govern. Debate about what the Maori signatories thought they were giving away remains a great talking-point, but relations between the races are more amicable in New Zealand than in most colonised countries. Extensive intermarriage continues.

British government systems led to such institutions as censuses and the registration of births, marriages, and deaths, very like the systems that were developing in Britain in the mid-19th century. The early registrations were, as in Britain, a bit short on detail from a genealogy viewpoint, but later that century more details were added to the requirements.

'''Sulfur dioxide''' is an [[Cookbook:Antioxidants|antioxidant]] used as a food preservative.
It allows [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricots]] and light-colored [[Cookbook:Grape|grapes]] to be dried without darkening. Many people find yellow [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] and yellow-orange dried apricots to be more attractive than brown ones.

Consumption of foods containing sulfur dioxide can cause lung irritation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Body note|This page is not part of the main Haskell Wikibook. It overlaps with the primary introductory material but isn't as polished. It has some assumptions about imperative programming background. Because learning works best when experiencing things from many angles, reading this as a supplement to reinforce basic concepts may be more effective than simply re-reading other chapters. Still, this page is basically extraneous.}}


''(All the examples in this chapter can be typed into a Haskell source file and evaluated by loading that file into GHC or Hugs.'')

==Variables that Don't and Functions that Do==
One of the main ideas behind functional programming is ''referential transparency'' — the idea that a function and a parameter can always be replaced by the function's return value. For example, the expression &lt;code&gt;2+2&lt;/code&gt; is interchangeable with the value &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;. This facilitates a number of important concepts in Haskell including lazy evaluation and the ability to reorder expressions to execute them concurrently.

Unlike imperative languages such as C++, Haskell does not treat variables as memory locations. In Haskell, variables are bound to a particular value within whatever scope the variable exists. They are more like constants than variables in most cases. The concept of ''variable'' in math is actually the same as that in Haskell. In the following example, x is bound to 3; it can't possibly change.

 x = 6 / 2

This may seem extremely weird if you are used to imperative programming. How can we write useful programs without actual variables? Well, Haskell's function parameters can serve the same purpose: once you pass a value to a function, that function can use it wherever it wants. To change the value of a parameter, just call the function again. So the answer is recursion.

Here are some Haskell declarations:

 x = 3
 y = x * 2

As you've probably guessed, by the end y = 6. Looks quite a bit like math doesn't it?

However, unlike a conventional language, the order doesn't matter.  Haskell doesn't have a notion of &quot;flow of control&quot;, so it doesn't start executing at the top and working its way down.  So this means exactly the same as the above:

 y = x * 2
 x = 3

You can of course also define functions. This is where life starts to get a little more interesting.

 double x = x * 2
 z = double y

This says that the function &quot;double&quot; takes an argument &quot;x&quot; and the result is equal to twice x.  Note the lack of parentheses: in Haskell &quot;double y&quot; means apply the function &quot;double&quot; to the value &quot;y&quot;.  Parentheses are only needed to determine evaluation priority, just like in math.

So far, this lets you do about as much as a spreadsheet would: variables in this world look a lot like cells in a spreadsheet, and you can set up functions that can &quot;do&quot; things with these variables.

Now look at this function:

 factorial 0 = 1
 factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)

This defines a new function called &quot;factorial&quot;.  The first line says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the second line says that the factorial of any other number &quot;n&quot; is equal to &quot;n&quot; times the factorial of &quot;n-1&quot;.  Note the parentheses around the &quot;n-1&quot;: without them this would have been parsed as &quot;(factorial n) - 1&quot;; function application (as this process is known) has higher precedence than any regular operator like addition or exponentiation.

This shows how you do &quot;loops&quot; in Haskell.  You don't have a loop counter like &quot;n = n - 1&quot; because that would change the value of &quot;n&quot;. So instead you use recursion.

Unlike our earlier example, the order of the two recursive declarations ''is'' important.  Haskell matches function calls starting at the top and picking the first one that matches.  So, if the two declarations were reversed then the compiler would conclude that factorial 0 equals 0 * factorial -1, and so on to infinity.  Not what we want.

==Tail Recursion==
In case you're wondering about stack space, won't all this recursion eventually overflow the stack? The answer is that Haskell supports [[W:tail recursion|tail recursion]] (every decent functional language's compiler does).  Tail recursion is the idea that if the ''last'' thing a function does is call itself, the interpreter may as well not bother putting things on the stack, and just &quot;jump&quot; to the beginning using the function's new arguments. In this case, though, the factorial function has to call itself with &quot;(n-1)&quot; and then multiply the result by &quot;n&quot;.

So our factorial function isn't tail recursive (because it has to multiply result by n after calling itself).  This one is, though:

 factorial n = factorial' n 1
 
 factorial' 0 a = a
 factorial' n a = factorial' (n-1) (n*a)

Here are two functions.  They have almost the same name, except the second has a tick mark. (Haskell identifiers are allowed to contain tick marks.) By convention, ticks are used to indicate a variation on something.

Here, the &lt;code&gt;factorial'&lt;/code&gt; function takes an argument &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; as before, but it also takes a second &quot;accumulator&quot; argument. Because calling itself is the last thing it does, the tail recursion rule applies: nothing gets put on the stack; the &lt;code&gt;factorial'&lt;/code&gt; function simply executes as if its arguments had always been n-1 and n*a.

(Note the similarity between this parameter and a variable. Parameters are, in a way, the variables of Haskell.)

A programmer using this function doesn't want to worry about the accumulator argument, so the plain factorial function is used to &quot;wrap up&quot; &lt;code&gt;factorial'&lt;/code&gt; by supplying the initial value of the accumulator.

===Exercises===
Type the factorial function into a Haskell source file and load it into your favourite Haskell environment.

What is factorial 5?

What about factorial 1000?  Is that what you expected?

What about factorial -1?

==Types==
You may have noticed something interesting above. None of your parameters or anything was declared to be of any particular type.

That's because Haskell uses a type system to infer the type of every expression, the Hindley-Milner type system. But Haskell is not weakly typed; it's strongly typed like C++, so you can't get runtime type errors. Any program that compiles is guaranteed to not have type errors in it. Another advantage is that when you make a mistake, it will almost always change the type of the resulting expression, and it'll be flagged by the compiler as such. (Your program simply won't compile.) You may still want to write types for your functions for a few reasons.

#It helps to document your program.
#When you get something wrong, the type declarations help to narrow down the source of the problem.
#Most importantly, it will help you learn. Understanding the type system is fundamental to getting a good grasp on Haskell.

The syntax for type declarations looks like this:

 x :: Integer
 factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer

You should read the first declaration as saying &quot;x is of type Integer&quot; or &quot;x has type Integer&quot;.  The '::' tells us we're referring to a type. You'll note factorial looks a bit different.  It's a function that takes an Integer and returns an Integer. Later on you'll see why we use -&gt; in describing the types, and why describing the type of a function is so close syntactically to describing the type of a variable.

One final note: identifiers that start with uppercase letters are reserved for types, modules and data constructors (somewhat like namespaces, don't worry about these for now). If you try to declare a variable or function that begins with an uppercase letter, the compiler will complain.

As I stumble around in the darkness--attempting to arrange the concept of Wiki, and how it relates to my work as a pre-service English Teacher--I have posted this page to act as an anchor from which superlative hopes will be thrust upon.

I am currently wrestling my way though my student teaching. I would love for Wiki to be my guide through much of what I am going through. I am very interested in taking any Creative Writing classes (preferably in the more advanced realm) or Graduate Level English courses. 

More importantly, I wish to become a regular in the Area of Wikiversity. I am excited at the possibilites that open source education has to offer.

I am an amateur fiction writer, and my scribblings can be found at my modest green and white web log, right [http://www.kronski.com here].


Anyone who is interested in open source Writing or Literature education, nudge me awake, and call me to action.</text>

''Hei hei (around Helsinki and the east) or Moi moi (around the western coast).''

''Hei'', ''moi'', ''terve'' and ''moro'' are used in informal speech everywhere in Finland. ''Hei hei'' and ''moi moi'' are such unsignificant slang words, that they should not be mentioned in this part of the book.

Very confused:
&quot;Hei, Moi, Terve and Moro.

Hi or Hello, an informal greeting, though moro is a bit more unusual word and terve is slightly less informal than the others. The last two are even more informal than the previous. &quot;

Hunh?  So which is it, terve is &quot;less informal&quot; or &quot;even more informal&quot; ?

I changed translation of &quot;Hyvää päivää&quot; into following:
literally &quot;Good day&quot;. Very common, rather formal greeting.
'Good Day' is often used insultingly in English, so it is no way a correct translation of Hyvää Päivää.</text>

| Everything – and I mean everything – would be lost if the cops saw me.  I was sitting at a table by myself in the back of a heavy metal bar I had visited off and on for the past year and a half.  About a third of the faces in the crowd were now familiar to me, and I nodded affirmatively to acknowledge the presence of acquaintances.   The place was packed, dark, and sweaty.  Long-haired leather-clad men and women broke sweat moving feverishly to the deafening wall of sound produced by the live band on stage.   

However, my sense of calm and comfort suddenly turned to mortification when I noticed the faces of two uniformed police officers in the dim light of the long bar off to my left.  They had just arrived to case the joint, and I had a lot at stake in staying out of sight.  For the next forty minutes I hid under tables, crouched on the dance floor, and in bathroom stalls as the officers methodically scoped out every inch of that club.  More than once, those I knew figured out something was up and assisted me by standing in between myself and the panoptical gaze of the officers.  When they finally left, others smiled at me knowingly as I breathed a sigh of relief.  Not only had I dodged the officers, but my actions had increased my street-cred among the regulars.

I was in the club that night because, as a sociologist, I was conducting a long-term participant observation study of the heavy metal scene.  Of all the nights in all the bars in a city exceeding one million people, my then-brother-in-law and his partner, both beat cops, decided to unknowingly case the very place in which I was making some observations.  I had already been approached at least a half dozen times that evening by regulars asking if I wanted to buy drugs of various sorts.  I rejected their offers, but I knew that exchanging pleasantries with an officer of the law would have immediately pegged me as a narc (undercover narcotics officer).  Not only would have this destroyed my credibility in that particular bar but the entire city scene, which would have prematurely ended my research project.  I was indeed fortunate to have avoided contact with the police.

'''Sociology''' is the study of human social life. Sociology has many sub-sections of study, ranging from the analysis of conversations to the development of theories to try to understand how the entire world works.  This chapter will introduce you to sociology and explain why it is important, how it can change your perspective of the world around you, and give a brief history of the discipline.

==What is Sociology?==
[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Emile Durkheim, one of the founders of Sociology.]]

Sociology is a branch of the social sciences that uses systematic methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop and refine a body of knowledge about human social structure and activity, sometimes with the goal of applying such knowledge to the pursuit of government policies designed to benefit the general social welfare. Its subject matter ranges from the micro level to the macro level. Micro-sociology involves the study of people in face-to-face interactions. Macro-sociology involves the study of widespread social processes.

Sociology is a broad discipline in terms of both methodology and subject matter. Its traditional focuses have included social relations, social stratification, social interaction, culture and deviance, and its approaches have included both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. As much of what humans do fits under the category of social structure or social activity, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to such far-flung subjects as the study of economic activity, health disparities, and even the role of social activity in the creation of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2008&quot;&gt;Moore, Kelly. 2008. Disrupting Science: Social Movements, American Scientists, and the Politics of the Military, 1945-1975. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of social scientific methods has also been broadly expanded. The &quot;cultural turn&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s brought more humanistic interpretive approaches to the study of culture in sociology. Conversely, the same decades saw the rise of new mathematically rigorous approaches, such as social network analysis.

The social world is changing. Some argue it is growing; others say it is shrinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; The important point to grasp is: society does not remain unchanged over time. As will be discussed in more detail below, sociology has its roots in significant societal changes (e.g., the [[w:Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], the creation of [[w:empire|empires]], and the age of [[w:Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of scientific reasoning). Early practitioners developed the discipline as an attempt to understand societal changes.

Some early sociological theorists (e.g., Marx, Weber, and Durkheim) were disturbed by the social processes they believed to be driving the change, such as the quest for solidarity, the attainment of social goals, and the rise and fall of classes, to name a few examples. The founders of sociology were some of the earliest individuals to employ what C. Wright Mills (a prominent mid-20th century American sociologist) labeled the sociological imagination: the ability to situate personal troubles within an informed framework of social issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills2000&quot;&gt;Mills, C. Wright. 2000. The Sociological Imagination. 40th ed. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mills proposed that:

:&quot;What people need... is a quality of mind that will help them to use information and to develop reason in order to achieve lucid summations of what is going on in the world and of what may be happening within themselves. The sociological imagination enables its possessor to understand the larger historical scene in terms of its meaning for the inner life and the external career of a variety of individuals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mills2000&quot;/&gt;

As Mills saw it, the sociological imagination could help individuals cope with the social world by helping them to step outside of their personal, self-centric view of the world. In employing the sociological imagination, people are able to see the events and social structures that influence behavior, attitudes, and culture.

The sociological imagination goes beyond armchair sociology or common sense. Many people believe they understand the world and the events taking place within it, even though they have not actually engaged in a systematic attempt to understanding the social world, as sociologists do. Humans like to attribute causes to events and attempt to understand what is taking place around them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer2002&quot;&gt;Boyer, Pascal. 2002. Religion Explained. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This is why individuals have been using religious ceremonies for centuries to invoke the will of the gods - because they believed the gods controlled certain elements of the natural world (e.g., the weather). Just as sacrificing two goats to ensure the safe operation of a Boeing 757 (and propitiate Akash Bhairab, the Hindu sky god) is an attempt to influence the natural world without first trying to understand how it works,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tierney2008&quot;&gt;Tierney, John. 2008. “Appeasing the Gods, With Insurance.” The International Herald Tribune, May 7 http://web.archive.org/web/20080518214239/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/07/healthscience/06tier.php (Accessed August 17, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  armchair sociology is an attempt to understand how the social world works without employing scientific methods.

It would be inaccurate to say sociologists never sit around (even sometimes in comfy armchairs) trying to figure out how the world works. But [[w:Inductive reasoning|induction]] is just a first step in understanding the social world. In order to test their theories, sociologists get up from their armchairs and enter the social world. They gather [[w:data|data]] and evaluate their theories in light of the data they collect (a.k.a. [[w:Deductive reasoning|deduction]]). Sociologists do not just propose theories about how the social world works. Sociologists test their theories about how the world works using the [[w:scientific method|scientific method]].

Sociologists, like all humans, have [[w:values|values]], [[w:beliefs|beliefs]], and even pre-conceived notions of what they might find in doing their research. But, as [[w:Peter Berger|Peter Berger]], a well-known sociologist, has argued, what distinguishes the sociologist from non-scientific researchers is that &quot;[the] sociologist tries to see what is there. He may have hopes or fears concerning what he may find. But he will try to see, regardless of his hopes or fears. It is thus an act of pure perception...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berger1963&quot;&gt;Berger, Peter L. 1963. Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective. 1st ed. Anchor. ISBN 0385065299&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociology, then, is an attempt to understand the social world by situating social events in their corresponding environment (i.e., social structure, culture, history) and trying to understand social phenomena by collecting and analyzing empirical data.

==History==
Sociology is a relatively new academic discipline.  It emerged in the early 19th century in response to the challenges of [[w:modernity|modernity]]. Increasing mobility and technological advances resulted in the increasing exposure of people to cultures and societies different from their own.  The impact of this exposure was varied, but for some people included the breakdown of traditional [[w:norms|norms]] and customs and warranted a  revised understanding of how the world works.  Sociologists responded to these changes by trying to understand what holds social groups together and also exploring possible solutions to the breakdown of [[w:social solidarity|social solidarity]].  

===Auguste Comte and Other Founders===


The term ''sociology'' was recoined by [[w:Auguste Comte|Auguste Comte]] (1798-1857) in 1838 from the [[w:latin language|Latin]] term ''socius'' (companion, associate) and the [[w:greek language|Greek]] term ''logia'' (study of, speech). Comte hoped to unify all the sciences under sociology; he believed sociology held the potential to improve society and direct human activity, including the other sciences. 

While it is no longer a theory employed in Sociology, Comte argued for an understanding of society he labeled ''The Law of Three Stages''.  Comte, not unlike other enlightenment thinkers, believed society developed in stages.  The first was the '''theological stage''' where people took a religious view of society. The second was the '''metaphysical stage''' where people understood society as natural (not [[w:supernature|supernatural]]).  Comte's final stage was the [[w:scientific|scientific]] or '''[[w:positivism|positivist]] stage''', which he believed to be the pinnacle of social development.  In the scientific stage, society would be governed by reliable knowledge and would be understood in light of the knowledge produced by science, primarily sociology.  While vague connections between Comte's ''Law'' and human history can be seen, it is generally understood in Sociology today that Comte's approach is a highly simplified and ill-founded approach to understand social development (see instead [[w:demographic transition|demographic transition theory]] and [[w:Ecological-Evolutionary Theory|Ecological-Evolutionary Theory]]).

Other ''classical'' theorists of sociology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[w:W. E. B. Du Bois|W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[w:Elizabeth Cady Stanton|Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[w:Karl Marx|Karl Marx]], [http://www2.asanet.org/governance/swaine.html Dorothy Swaine Thomas], [[w:W. I. Thomas|W. I. Thomas]], [[w:Ferdinand Toennies|Ferdinand Toennies]], [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], [[w:Vilfredo Pareto|Vilfredo Pareto]], [[w:Virginia Woolf|Virginia Woolf]], [[w:George Herbert Mead|George Herbert Mead]], and [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]]. As pioneers in Sociology, most of the early sociological thinkers were trained in other academic disciplines, including history, philosophy, and economics.  The diversity of their trainings is reflected in the topics they researched, including [[w:religion|religion]], [[w:education|education]], [[w:economics|economics]], [[w:psychology|psychology]], [[w:ethics|ethics]], [[w:philosophy|philosophy]], and [[w:theology|theology]]. Perhaps with the exception of Marx, Stanton, and Woolf, their most enduring influence has been on sociology, and it is in this field that their theories are still considered most applicable. 

As a descendant of the French Enlightenment, Comte was impressed, as were many of the philosophes, with the [[w:Newtonian revolution|Newtonian revolution]]. Comte argued for a particular view of sociological theory: All phenomena are subject to invariable natural laws, and sociologists must use their observations to uncover the laws governing the social universe, in much the same way as Newton had formulated the law of gravity. Comte emphasized this agenda in the opening pages of ''Positive Philosophy'':

{|style=&quot;width:80%; text-align:center; background-color:#F5D0A9;&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; 
|- 
| ''The first characteristic of Positive Philosophy is that it regards all phenomena as subject to invariable natural Laws. Our businesses—seeing how vain any research into what are is called Causes whether first or final—to pursue an accurate discovery of these Laws, with a view to reducing them to the smallest possible number. By speculating upon causes, we could solve no difficulty about origin and purpose. Our real business is to analyze accurately the circumstances of phenomena, and to connect them by the natural relations of succession and resemblance. The best Illustration of this is in the case of the doctrine of gravitation. Several points are important in this view of sociological theory. First, sociological theory is not to be concerned with causes per se but, rather, with the laws that describe the basic and fundamental relations of properties in the social world. Second, sociological theory must reject arguments by “final causes”—that is, analysis of the results of a particular phenomenon for the social whole. This disavowal is ironic because Comte’s more substantive work helped found sociological functionalism, a mode of analysis that often examines the functions or final causes of phenomena. Third, clearly the goal of sociological activity is to reduce the number of theoretical principles by seeking only the most abstract and only those that pertain to understanding fundamental properties of the social world.''
|}

Comte felt that philosophy had done as much as possible in terms of understanding the human condition. He believed that it was time for a &quot;positivistic&quot; approach. That meant studying things that were of an [[w:empiricism|empirical]] (testable) nature. He thought that sociology must be based on observation, not intuition or speculation. Comte thus held a vision of sociological theory as based on the model of the natural sciences, particularly the physics of his time. For this reason, he preferred the term social physics to sociology.

===The Development of the Discipline===



The first book with the word ''sociology'' in its title was assembled in the 19th century by the English philosopher [[w:Herbert Spencer|Herbert Spencer]]. In the United States, the first ''Sociology'' course was taught at the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1890 under the title ''Elements of Sociology'' (the oldest continuing sociology course in America). The first full fledged university department of sociology in the United States was established in 1892 at the University of Chicago by [[w:Albion W. Small|Albion W. Small]], who in 1895 founded the [[w:American Journal of Sociology|American Journal of Sociology]]. The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]], founder of [[w:Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]] (1896). In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber]] and in 1920 in Poland by [[w:Florian Znaniecki|Florian Znaniecki]]. The first sociology departments in the United Kingdom were founded after the Second World War.

International cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when [[w:Rene Worms|Rene Worms]] founded the small [[w:Institut International de Sociologie|Institut International de Sociologie]] that was eclipsed by the much larger [[w:International Sociologist Association|International Sociologist Association]] starting in 1949. In 1905 the [[w:American Sociological Association|American Sociological Association]], the world's largest association of professional sociologists, was founded.

===Early Sociological Studies===

Early sociological studies considered the field to be similar to the [[w:natural science|natural sciences]], like [[:physics|physics]] or [[w:biology|biology]]. As a result, many researchers argued that the [[w:methodology|methodology]] used in the natural sciences was perfectly suited for use in the social sciences. The effect of employing the [[w:scientific method|scientific method]] and stressing [[w:empiricism|empiricism]] was the distinction of sociology from [[w:theology|theology]], [[w:philosophy|philosophy]], and [[w:metaphysics|metaphysics]].  This also resulted in sociology being recognized as an empirical science. This early sociological approach, supported by August Comte, led to [[w:positivism|positivism]], a methodological approach based on [[w:sociological naturalism|sociological naturalism]].  The goal of positivism, like the natural sciences, is prediction.  But in the case of sociology, it is prediction of human behavior, which is a complicated proposition.

The goal of predicting human behavior was quickly realized to be a bit lofty.  Scientists like [[w:Wilhelm Dilthey|Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[w:Heinrich Rickert|Heinrich Rickert]] argued that the natural world differs from the social world, as human society has [[w:culture|culture]], unlike the societies of most other animals (e.g., the behavior of ants, wolves, etc. is primarily based on genetic instructions and is not passed from generation to generation through ''socialization'').  As a result, an additional goal was proposed for sociology. Max Weber&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1997&quot;&gt;Weber, Max. 1997. The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilhelm Dilthey&lt;ref name=&quot;Dilthey1978&quot;&gt;Dilthey, W. 1978. Descriptive Psychology and Historical Understanding. 1st ed. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of '''[[w:verstehen|verstehen]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glass2005&quot;&gt;Glass, John E. 2005. “Visceral Verstehen.” Electronic Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of ''verstehen'' is less to predict behavior than it is to understand behavior.  Outside observers of a culture relate to an indigenous people on both the observer's and the observeds' own terms in order to comprehend the cultural conditions.  While arriving at a verstehen-like understanding of a culture employs systematic methodologies like the positivistic approach of predicting human behavior, it is often a more subjective process.  

The inability of sociology and other social sciences to perfectly predict the behavior of humans or to fully comprehend a different culture has led to the social sciences being labeled &quot;soft sciences.&quot;  While some might consider this label derogatory, in a sense it can be seen as an admission of the remarkable complexity of humans as social animals.  Any animal as complex as humans is bound to be difficult to fully comprehend.  What's more, humans, human society, and human culture are all constantly changing, which means the social sciences will constantly be works in progress.

===Quantitative vs. Qualitative Sociology ===

The contrast between positivist sociology and the verstehen approach has been reformulated in modern sociology as a distinction between '''quantitative''' and '''qualitative''' methodological approaches, respectively. Quantitative sociology is generally a numerical approach to understanding human behavior.  Surveys with large numbers of participants are aggregated into data sets and analyzed using statistics, allowing researchers to discern patterns in human behavior.  Qualitative sociology generally opts for depth over breadth.  The qualitative approach uses in-depth interviews, focus groups, or analysis of content sources (books, magazines, journals, TV shows, etc.) as the data source.  These sources are then analyzed systematically to discern patterns and to arrive at a better understanding of human behavior. 

Drawing a hard and fast distinction between quantitative and qualitative sociology is a bit misleading. The first step in all sciences is the development of a set of questions and ideas that may be empirically examined.  After this initial stage, however, researchers typically take one of two paths, which may be seen to varying degrees in both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.  While most qualitative researchers begin analyzing data in hopes of generating theories that could later be tested in other studies, &lt;ref name=&quot;Denzin2007&quot;&gt;Denzin, Norman K., and Yvonna S. Lincoln. 2007. Collecting and Interpreting Qualitative Materials. Third Edition. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; most quantitative researchers begin by elaborating testable hypotheses from existing theories.  While this initial step demonstrates nuanced variations in methodology, the approaches really begin to differ in relation to the second step - data collection.  Quantitative sociology mostly focuses on numerical representations of the research subjects (e.g., Do [[w:conservative Christian|conservative Christian]] fathers spend more time in child care than [[w:secular|secular]] fathers, when measured in hours?&lt;ref name=&quot;Civettini2008&quot;&gt;Civettini, Nicole H. W., and Jennifer Glass. 2008. “The Impact of Religious Conservativism on Men's Work and Family Involvement.” Gender &amp; Society 22:172-193.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Qualitative sociology generally focuses on the ideas found within the discourse, rhetoric, and activities of the research subjects (e.g., What is the narrative gay men's groups use in their official publications to explain their continued participation in religions that condemn their sexual orientation?&lt;ref name=&quot;Loseke2001&quot;&gt;Loseke, Donileen R., and James C. Cavendish. 2001. “Producing Institutional Selves: Rhetorically Constructing the Dignity of Sexually Marginalized Catholics..” Social Psychology Quarterly 64:347-362.&lt;/ref&gt;).  The goal of both approaches is to answer a question and/or test a theory in ways that ultimately further scientific understanding of the broader social world.

== Sociology and Other Social Sciences ==
The '''social sciences''' comprise the application of [[w:scientific method|scientific method]]s to the study of the human aspects of the world. [[w:Psychology|Psychology]] studies the human [[w:mind|mind]] and micro-level (or individual) behavior; sociology examines human society; [[w:political science|political science]] studies the governing of groups and countries; [[w:communication|communication]] studies the flow of discourse via various media; [[w:economics|economics]] concerns itself with the production and allocation of wealth in society; and [[w:social work|social work]] is the application of social scientific knowledge in society. Social sciences diverge from the [[w:humanities|humanities]] in that many in the social sciences emphasize  the scientific method or other rigorous standards of evidence in the study of humanity.

=== The Development of Social Science ===



In ancient philosophy, there was no difference between the liberal arts of mathematics and the study of history, poetry or politics. Only with the development of mathematical proof did there gradually arise a perceived difference between ''scientific'' disciplines and the ''humanities'' or ''liberal arts''. Thus, [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] studied planetary motion and poetry with the same methods; [[w:Plato|Plato]] mixed geometrical proofs with his demonstration on the state of intrinsic knowledge. 

This unity of science as descriptive remained, for example, in the time of [[w:Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], who argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework.  His book, ''[[w:Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'', was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. Within decades of Hobbes' work a revolution took place in what constituted ''science'', particularly with the work of [[w:Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton]] in physics. Newton, by revolutionizing what was then called ''natural philosophy'', changed the basic framework by which individuals understood what was ''scientific''. 

While Newton was merely the archetype of an accelerating trend, the important distinction is that for Newton the mathematical flowed from a presumed reality independent of the observer and it worked by its own rules. For philosophers of the same period, mathematical expression of philosophical ideals were taken to be symbolic of natural human relationships as well: the same laws moved physical and spiritual reality. For examples see [[w:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]], [[w:Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[w:Johannes Kepler|Johannes Kepler]], each of whom took mathematical examples as models for human behavior directly. In Pascal's case, the famous wager; for Leibniz, the invention of binary computation; and for Kepler, the intervention of angels to guide the planets.

In the realm of other disciplines, this created a pressure to express ideas in the form of mathematical relationships. Such relationships, called ''Laws'' after the usage of the time (see [[w:philosophy of science|philosophy of science]]) became the model that other disciplines would emulate. In the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about human behavior became increasingly common. Among the first were the ''Laws'' of philology, which attempted to map the change overtime of sounds in a language. In the early 20th century, a wave of change came to science. [[w:statistics|Statistics]] and [[w:probability|probability theory]] were sufficiently developed to be considered &quot;scientific&quot;, resulting in the widespread use of statistics in the social sciences (they are also widely used in most other sciences as well, including biology).

The first thinkers to attempt to combine scientific inquiry with the exploration of human relationships were [[w:Emile Durkheim|Emile Durkheim]] in France and [[w:William James|William James]] in the United States. Durkheim's sociological theories and James' work on experimental psychology had an enormous impact on those who followed. 

One of the most persuasive advocates for the view of scientific treatment of philosophy is [[w:John Dewey|John Dewey]] (1859-1952). He began, as Marx did, in an attempt to weld Hegelian idealism and logic to experimental science, for example in his ''Psychology'' of 1887. However, it is when he abandoned Hegelian constructs and joined the movement in America called [[w:Pragmatism|Pragmatism]] that he began to formulate his basic doctrine on the three phases of the process of inquiry:

#problematic situation, where the typical response is inadequate
#isolation of data or subject matter
#reflective, which is tested empirically

With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences (see, for example [[w:Lord Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]]'s famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically &quot;is a poor sort of knowledge&quot;), the stage was set for the division of the study of humanity into the humanities and the ''social sciences''.  Alongside these developments, [[w:Pragmatism|Pragmatism]] facilitated the emergence of qualitative social science via the ethnographic and community-based endeavors of the [[w:Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] in the 1920's and 1930's.  The combination of these quantitative and qualitative advancements thus established social science as an empirical endeavor distinct from the humanities.

==Sociology Today==
Although sociology emerged from Comte's vision of a discipline that would subsume all other areas of scientific inquiry, that was not to be the future of sociology.  Far from replacing the other sciences, sociology has taken its place as a particular perspective for investigating human social life.

In the past, sociological research focused on the organization of complex, [[w:industrial society|industrial societies]] and their influence on individuals. Today, sociologists study a broad range of topics. For instance, some sociologists research [[w:social structure|macro-structures]] that organize society, such as [[w:race|race]] or [[w:ethnicity|ethnicity]], [[w:social class|social class]], [[w:gender role|gender]], and institutions such as the [[w:family|family]]. Other sociologists study social processes that represent the breakdown of macro-structures, including [[w:deviance|deviance]], [[w:crime|crime]], and [[w:divorce|divorce]]. Additionally, some sociologists study micro-processes such as interpersonal interactions and the [[w:socialization|socialization]] of individuals.  It should also be noted that recent sociologists, taking cues from anthropologists, have realized the ''[[w:Western|Western]]'' emphasis of the discipline. In response, many sociology departments around the world are now encouraging multi-cultural research.

The next two chapters in this book will introduce the reader to more extensive discussions of the methods and theory employed in sociology.  The remaining chapters are examinations of current areas of research in the discipline.

| As a pastoralist society, the [[w:Maasai_people|Maasai]] way of life revolves around their livestock. They often times will travel hundreds of miles of semi-arid and arid terrain of Kenya and Tanzania in search of grazing lands and watering holes for their cattle. The cows are invaluable in providing a constant source of protein in the form of meat, blood, and milk, but also supplying the dried dung for constructing their semi-temporary huts. Considering the importance of cattle in their society, a Maasai male’s amount of wealth as well as his allotment of wives are usually determined by the number of cattle he possesses. The Maasai people are a society reminiscent of a way of life long before the Industrial Revolution and the current post-industrial period where technology has become a global norm. However, the Maasai pastoralist traditions have managed to endure in the midst of extreme social change. How have they been able to do this?

Today, you will still see the Maasai people migrating across many miles of dry desert in their traditional garb composed of a checkered cape and an assortment of bracelets for the women and men. However, there is one new added accessory. A cell phone. The Maasai today can now use the GPS on their cell phones to locate grazing areas and watering holes for their cattle and also take advantage of other mobile applications such as those that locate potential predators in the area. Cell phones have made avoiding as well as hunting lions much easier for the Maasai people. Many members of their society have even taken advantage of cell phones to establish and boost a tourism business geared towards offering outsiders a taste of the Maasai life. Hence, cell phones have paradoxically been a key component in maintaining the Masaai’s traditional way of life in the face of extreme social change during the Age of Globalization.

The Masaai people are an illustrative example of how one particular society has been able to straddle two stages of societal development (i.e., pastoralist and post-industrial) simultaneously. This chapter on “society” first explicates the different stages of societal development, and later introduces the classical views of Weber, Marx, and Durkheim concerning the impact of social change from the pre-industrial societies such as the Maasai people to the industrialized societies that appear to be much more commonplace today.

==Introduction==
The simplest definition of '''society''' is a group of people who share a defined territory and a culture.  In sociology, we take that definition a little further by arguing that society is also the social structure and interactions of that group of people. Social structure is the relatively enduring patterns of behavior and relationships within a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merton1938&quot;&gt;Merton, Robert. 1938. Social Structure. Filipino Sociological Review, Vol. 3, No.5, pp.672-682&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a society is not only the group of people and their culture, but the relationships between the people and the institutions within that group.

In sociology, a distinction is made between society and culture.  Culture refers to the norms, values, beliefs, behaviors, and meanings given to symbols in a society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swidler2003&quot;&gt;Swidler, A. (2003). Talk of Love: How Culture Matters. University Of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture is distinct from society in that it adds meanings to relationships.  For instance, what it means to be a &quot;husband&quot; to a gay couple in Boston is very different from what it means to be a husband to a polygamist man in rural southern Utah.  Thus, while the relationship exists in both (i.e., they both have social structure), what the relationship means differs by culture.

All human societies have a culture and culture can only exist where there is a society.  Sociologists distinguish between society and culture despite their close interconnectedness primarily for analytical purposes: It allows sociologists to think about societal development independent of culture and cultural change (which are discussed in the next chapter in greater detail) even though societal change and development are contingent upon culture. 

This chapter presents a brief overview of some of the types of human societies that have existed and continue to exist.  It will then present some classic approaches to understanding society and what changing social structure can mean for individuals.

==Societal Development==
The sociological understanding of societal development relies heavily upon the work of [[w:Gerhard Emmanuel Lenski|Gerhard Lenski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenski1995&quot;&gt;Lenski, Gerhard; Nolan, Patrick; and Lenski, Jean. 1995. Human Societies: An Introduction to Macrosociology. 7th edition. New York: McGraw-Hill. ISBN 1594510237&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenski outlined some of the more commonly seen organizational structures in human societies. Classifications of human societies can be based on two factors: (1) the primary means of subsistence and (2) the political structure.  This chapter focuses on the subsistence systems of societies rather than their political structures.

While it is a bit far-reaching to argue that all societies will develop through the stages outlined below, it does appear that most societies follow such a route.  Human groups begin as hunter-gatherers, move toward pastoralism and/or horticulturalism, develop toward an agrarian society, and ultimately end up undergoing a period of industrialization (with the potential for developing a service industry following industrialization).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;/&gt;  Not all societies pass through every stage.  Some societies have stopped at the pastoral or horticultural stage (e.g., Bedouin nomads), though these may be temporary pauses due to economic niches that will likely disappear over time.  Some societies may also jump stages as a result of the introduction of technology from other societies.  It is also worth noting that these categories aren't really distinct groups as there is often overlap in the subsistence systems used in a society.  Some pastoralist societies also engage in some measure of horticultural food production and most industrial and post-industrial societies still have agriculture, just in a reduced capacity.  

===Hunter-Gatherer===
The '''hunter-gatherer''' way of life is based on the exploitation of wild plants and animals.  Consequently, hunter-gatherers are relatively mobile, and groups of hunter-gatherers have fluid boundaries and composition. Typically in hunter-gatherer societies men hunt larger wild animals and women gather fruits, nuts, roots, and other edible plant-based food and hunt smaller animals. Hunter-gatherers use materials available in the wild to construct shelters or rely on naturally occurring shelters like overhangs. Their shelters give them protection from predators and the elements.

[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer des Menna 005.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ancient hunter.]]

The majority of hunter-gatherer societies are nomadic. It is difficult to be settled under such a subsistence system as the resources of one region can quickly become exhausted. Hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have very low population densities as a result of their subsistence system. Agricultural subsistence systems can support population densities 60 to 100 times greater than land left uncultivated, resulting in denser populations.

Hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have non-hierarchical social structures, though this is not always the case.  Because hunter-gatherers tend to be nomadic, they generally do not have the possibility to store surplus food.  As a result, full-time leaders, bureaucrats, or artisans are rarely supported by hunter-gatherer societies. The hierarchical egalitarianism in hunter-gatherer societies tends to extend to gender-based egalitarianism as well. Although disputed, many anthropologists believe gender egalitarianism in hunter-gatherer societies stems from the lack of control over food production, lack of food surplus (which can be used for control), and an equal gender contribution to kin and cultural survival.

Archeological evidence to date suggests that prior to 13,000BCE, all human beings were hunter-gatherers. While declining in number, there are still some hunter-gatherer groups in existence today. Such groups are found in the Arctic, tropical rainforests, and deserts where other forms of subsistence production are impossible or too costly. In most cases these groups do not have a continuous history of hunting and gathering; in many cases their ancestors were agriculturalists who were pushed into marginal areas as a result of migrations and wars.  Examples of hunter-gatherer groups still in existence include: 

*[[w:Sentinelese people|Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands (near India)]]

The line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies is not clear cut.  Many hunter-gatherers consciously manipulate the landscape through cutting or burning useless (to them) plants to encourage the growth and success of those they consume.  Most agricultural people also tend to do some hunting and gathering.  Some agricultural groups farm during the temperate months and hunt during the winter.

===Pastoralist===
[[Image:The Nomads Simple Life (266139764).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Iranian nomads in 2006.]]

A '''pastoralist''' society is a society in which the primary means of subsistence is domesticated livestock.  It is often the case that, like hunter-gatherers, pastoralists are nomadic, moving seasonally in search of fresh pastures and water for their animals. Employment of a pastoralist subsistence system often results in greater population densities and the development of both social hierarchies and divisions in labor as it is more likely there will be a surplus of food.  

Pastoralist societies still exist.  For instance, in Australia, the vast semi-arid areas in the interior of the country contain pastoral runs called sheep stations. These areas may be thousands of square kilometers in size. The number of livestock allowed in these areas is regulated in order to reliably sustain them, providing enough feed and water for the stock. Other examples of pastoralists societies still in existence include:
*[[w:Maasai people|the Maasai of Kenya]]
*[[w:Borana Oromo people|the Borana Oromo of southern Ethiopia]]
*[[w:Turkana people|the Turkana of Kenya]]
*[[w:Bedouin|the Bedouin of Northern Africa]]

===Horticulturalist===
'''Horticulturalist''' societies are societies in which the primary means of subsistence is the cultivation of crops using hand tools.  Like pastoral societies, the cultivation of crops increases population densities and, as a result of food surpluses, allows for a division of labor in society.  

Horticulture differs from agriculture in that agriculture employs animals, machinery, or some other non-human means to facilitate the cultivation of crops while horticulture relies solely on humans for crop cultivation.

===Agrarian===

'''Agrarian''' societies are societies in which the primary means of subsistence is the cultivation of crops using a mixture of human and non-human means (i.e., animals and/or machinery). '''Agriculture''' is the process of producing food, feed, fiber, and other desired products by the cultivation of plants and the raising of domesticated animals (livestock). ''Agriculture'' can refer to subsistence agriculture or industrial agriculture.

'''Subsistence agriculture''' is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the agriculturalist and his/her family.  Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seed native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield. Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations. 

In developed nations a person using such simple techniques on small patches of land would generally be referred to as a gardener; activity of this type would be seen more as a hobby than a profession. Some people in developed nations are driven into such primitive methods by poverty. It is also worth noting that large scale organic farming is on the rise as a result of a renewed interest in non-genetically modified and pesticide free foods. 

In developed nations, a ''farmer'' or ''industrial agriculturalist'' is usually defined as someone with an ownership interest in crops or livestock, and who provides labor or management in their production.  Farmers obtain their financial income from the cultivation of land to yield crops or the commercial raising of animals (animal husbandry), or both.  Those who provide only labor but not management and do not have ownership are often called ''farmhands'', or, if they supervise a leased strip of land growing only one crop, as ''sharecroppers''.

Agriculture allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of surplus, specialization, advanced technology, hierarchical social structures, inequality, and standing armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;/&gt;

====Development of Horticulture and Agriculture====
Horticulture and agriculture as types of subsistence developed among humans somewhere between 10,000 and 8,000 B.C.E. in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price2000&quot;&gt;Price, T. Douglas [ed.]. 2000. Europe's First Farmers. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521665728&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1996&quot;&gt;Harris, David R. [ed.]. 1996. The Origins and Spread of Agriculture in Eurasia. UCL Press. ISBN 1560986751&lt;/ref&gt;  The reasons for the development of horticulture and agriculture are debated but may have included climate change and the accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift-giving. Most certainly there was a gradual transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild. In addition to the emergence of farming in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture appeared by at least 6,800 B.C.E. in East Asia (rice) and, later, in Central and South America (maize and squash). Small scale agriculture also likely arose independently in early Neolithic contexts in India (rice) and Southeast Asia (taro).&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;&gt;Diamond, Jared. 2005. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. 1st ed. W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full dependency on domestic crops and animals (i.e. when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet) did not occur until the Bronze Age. If the operative definition of ''agriculture'' includes large scale intensive cultivation of land, i.e., mono-cropping, organised irrigation, and use of a specialized labor force, the title &quot;inventors of agriculture&quot; would fall to the Sumerians, starting around 5,500 B.C.E. 

By the early 1800s agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before, especially in the largely virgin lands of North and South America.

====Agriculture Today====
In the world, the use of crop breeding, better management of soil nutrients, and improved weed control have greatly increased yields per unit area.  At the same time, the use of mechanization has decreased labor input. The developing world generally produces lower yields, having less of the latest science, capital, and technology base.  More people in the world are involved in agriculture as their primary economic activity than in any other, yet it only accounts for four percent of the world's GDP.  The rapid rise of mechanization in the 20th century, especially in the form of the tractor, reduced the necessity of humans performing the demanding tasks of sowing, harvesting, and threshing. With mechanization, these tasks could be performed with a speed and on a scale barely imaginable before. These advances have resulted in a substantial increase in the yield of agricultural techniques that have also translated into a decline in the percentage of populations in developed countries that are required to work in agriculture to feed the rest of the population.  As the pie chart below indicates, about 1% of Americans are employed in agriculture today and produce sufficient food to feed the other 99% of Americans.

===Industrial===
[[File:Steenfabriek, Tolkamer, Netherlands.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A brick factory in the Netherlands is an example of industry.]]

An '''industrial society''' is a society in which the primary means of subsistence is ''industry''.  Industry is a system of production focused on mechanized manufacturing of goods.  Like agrarian societies, industrial societies increase food surpluses, resulting in more developed hierarchies and significantly more division of labor.  

The division of labor in industrial societies is often one of the most notable elements of the society and can even function to re-organize the development of relationships.  Whereas relationships in pre-industrial societies were more likely to develop through contact at one's place of worship or through proximity of housing, industrial society brings people with similar occupations together, often leading to the formation of friendships through one's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;DurkheimandCoser1997&quot;/&gt;

When capitalised, The Industrial Revolution refers to the first known industrial revolution, which took place in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.  What is some times referred to as The Second Industrial Revolution describes later, somewhat less dramatic changes resulting from the widespread availability of electric power and the internal-combustion engine. Many developing nations began industrialisation under the influence of either the United States or the USSR during the Cold War.

Today, industry makes up only a relatively small percentage of highly developed countries' workforce (see the pie chart above), in large part due to advanced mechanization.  The use of machines and robots to facilitate manufacturing reduces the number of people required to work in industry by increasing their efficiency.  As a result, a single worker can produce substantially more goods in the same amount of time today than they used to be able to produce.  This has also resulted in a transition in most highly developed countries into a post-industrial or service-oriented economy.

===Post-Industrial===
A '''post-industrial society''' is a society in which the primary means of subsistence is derived from service-oriented work, as opposed to agriculture or industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell1973&quot;&gt;Bell, D. (1973). The Coming of Post-Industrial Society : a Venture in Social Forecasting. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note here that the term ''post-industrial'' is still debated in part because it is the current state of society; it is difficult to name a phenomenon while it is occurring. 

Post-industrial societies are often marked by: 
*an increase in the size of the service sector or jobs that perform services rather than creating goods (industry)
*either the outsourcing of or extensive use of mechanization in manufacturing
*an increase in the amount of information technology, often leading to an Information Age 
*information, knowledge, and creativity are seen as the new raw materials of the economy

Most highly developed countries are now post-industrial in that the majority of their workforce works in service-oriented industries, like finance, healthcare, education, business or sales, rather than in industry or agriculture.  This is the case in the U.S., as depicted in the pie chart above.

''Post-industrial society'' is occasionally used critically by individuals seeking to restore or return to industrial development.  Increasingly, however, individuals and communities are viewing abandoned factories as sites for new housing and shopping. Capitalists are also realizing the recreational and commercial development opportunities such locations offer.

===The Implications of Societal Development===
[[File:Societal development.png|thumb|right|400px|The stages of societal development.]]

As noted throughout the above discussion of societal development, changes in the social structure of a society - in this case the primary means of subsistence - also affect other aspects of society.  For instance, as hunters and gatherers make the transition into pastoralism and horticulture, they also develop a surplus in food stuffs.  While it is common for people in the developed world today to have lots of surplus food, we rarely consider just how important that extra food is.  To begin with, once a society has surplus food, that means more of their children will survive into adulthood.  Additionally, as food yields increase in agricultural societies, smaller percentages of the population are required to produce the food for the rest of the population.  This frees up those people not engaged in food production to specialize in other areas, like clothing or housing production.  This results in specialists: some people become experts in growing crops or raising livestock while others become experts in clothing production, metal-working, home construction, etc.  That specialization leads to rapid increases in technology as people are freed from having to spend the majority of their time finding or growing their food and can then spend their time improving at their speciality.  The relationship between surplus and technology may not seem obvious, initially, but surplus is clearly the forerunner of technological development.

This is illustrated in the diagram to the right.  The diagram shows societal development along the top and the implications of societal development along the bottom.  The arrows running between the two rows illustrate the fact that these relationships are very complex.  For instance, specialization not only results from agriculture but also from denser populations and surplus and helps spur industry.  The point being, these are interdependent aspects of societal development that co-evolve.

One additional outcome of surplus that is included in the diagram is ''inequality.''  Inequality will be discussed in much greater detail later in this book, but it is important to note that as soon as there is surplus, there will be greater surplus for some people, and some people - as evidenced in most developed societies today - may not have access to enough resources despite the exist of a surplus within the larger society.  Those with more surplus have an economic advantage relative to those with less surplus as they have greater bargaining power and in many cases - et voilà, social inequality is born.

==Classical Views on Social Change==
As Western societies transitioned from pre-industrial economies based primarily on agriculture to industrialized societies in the 19th century, some people worried about the impacts such changes would have on society and individuals.  Three early sociologists, Weber, Marx, and Durkheim, perceived different impacts of the Industrial Revolution on the individual and society and described those impacts in their work.  

===Weber and Rationalization===
Max Weber was particularly concerned about the rationalization and bureaucratization of society stemming from the Industrial Revolution and how these two changes would affect humanity's agency and happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1997&quot;&gt;Weber, Max. 1997. The Theory Of Social And Economic Organization. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Weber understood society, particularly during the industrial revolution of the late 19th century in which he lived, society was being driven by the passage of rational ideas into culture which, in turn, transformed society into an increasingly bureaucratic entity. ''Bureaucracy'' is a type of organizational or institutional management that is, as Weber understood it, rooted in legal-rational authority. Bureaucracy is a complex means of managing life in social institutions that includes rules and regulations, patterns and procedures that both are designed to simplify the functioning of complex organizations.  An example of bureaucracy would be the forms used to pay one's income taxes - they require specific information and procedures to fill them out.  Included in that form, however, are countless rules and laws that dictate what can and can't be tied into one's taxes.  Thus, bureaucracy simplifies the process of paying one's taxes by putting the process into a formulaic structure, but simultaneously complicates it by adding rules and regulations that govern the procedure.  Weber did believe bureaucracy was the most rational form of institutional governance, but because Weber viewed rationalization as the driving force of society, he believed bureaucracy would increase until it ruled society. Society, for Weber, would become almost synonymous with bureaucracy.

As Weber did not see any alternative to bureaucracy, he believed it would ultimately lead to an ''iron cage'': there would be no way to get out of it. Weber viewed this as a bleak outcome that would affect individuals' happiness as they would be forced to function in a highly rational society with rigid rules and norms without the possibility to change it. Because Weber could not envision other forces influencing the ultimate direction of society - the exception being temporary lapses into non-bureaucracy spurred by charismatic leaders - he saw no cure for the iron cage of rationality. Society would become a large bureaucracy that would govern people's lives. Weber was unable to envision a solution to his ''iron cage of bureaucracy'' dilemma. Since a completely rational society was inevitable and bureaucracy was the most rational form of societal management, the iron cage, according to Weber, does not have a solution.

===Marx and Alienation===
Karl Marx took a different perspective on the impact of the Industrial Revolution on society and the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx1906&quot;&gt;Marx, Karl. 1906. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy. Modern Library Giant. The Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand Marx's perspective, however, it is necessary to understand how Marx perceived ''happiness''. According to Marx, ''[[w:species being|species being]]'' (or happiness) is the pinnacle of human nature. Species being is understood to be a type of self-realization or self-actualization brought about by meaningful work. But in addition to engaging in meaningful work, self-actualized individuals must also own the products of their labors and have the option of doing what they will with those products.

In a capitalist society (which was co-evolved with the Industrial Revolution), rather than owning the fruits of their labors, the proletariat or working class owns only their labor power, not the fruits of their labors (i.e., the results of production). The capitalists or bourgeoisie employ the proletariat for a living wage, but then keep the products of the labor. As a result, the proletariat is alienated from the fruits of its labor – they do not own the products they produce, only their labor power. Because Marx believed species being to be the goal and ideal of human nature and that species being could only be realized when individuals owned the results of their labors, Marx saw capitalism as leading toward increasingly unhappy individuals; they would be alienated from the results of their production and therefore would not be self-realized.

But the alienation from the results of their production is just one component of the alienation Marx proposed.  In addition to the alienation from the results of production, the proletariat is also alienated from each other under capitalism. Capitalists alienate the proletariat from each other by forcing them to compete for limited job opportunities. Job opportunities are limited under capitalism in order for capitalists to keep wages down; without a pool of extraneous workers, capitalists would have to meet the wage demands of their workers. Because they are forced to compete with other members of the proletariat, workers are alienated from each other, compounding the unhappiness of the proletariat.

While Marx did have a solution to the problem of alienation, he seldom discussed it in detail. Marx's proposed solution was for the proletariat to unite and through protests or revolution (or legislation in democratic nations) overthrow the bourgeoisie and institute a new form of government – communism. This form of government would be based on communally owned and highly developed means of production and self-governance. The means of production would be developed – through capitalism – to the point that everyone in society would have sufficient 'free' time to allow them to participate in whatever governmental decisions needed to be made for the community as a whole. By re-connecting the individual with the fruits of their labor and empowering them toward true self-governance, ''species being'' would be realized and happiness would be returned.

Two additional comments are in order here. First, the economic systems that developed in The Soviet Union and China - as well as other parts of the world - was not the communism envisioned by Marx. Rather, they had achieved a form of socialism, what Marx called the stage between capitalism and communism. Second, Marx believed capitalism, while harmful to ''species being'', was necessary to advance the means of production to a stage where communism (as he envisioned it) could be realized. Thus, while Marx was highly critical of capitalism, he also recognized its utility in developing the means of production.

===Durkheim and Solidarity===
Durkheim's view of society and the changes it was undergoing as a result of industrialization also led him to believe unhappiness was a possible outcome. Durkheim believed that an important component of social life was social solidarity, which is understood as ''a sense of community''. In his classic study, ''Suicide'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim1997&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1997. Suicide. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim argued that one of the root causes of suicide was a decrease in social solidarity – termed ''anomie'' (French for ''chaos'') by Durkheim. Durkheim also argued that the increasing emphasis on individualism found in Protestant religions – in contrast to Catholicism – contributed to an increase in anomie, which resulted in higher suicide rates among Protestants.

In another work, ''The Division of Labor in Society'',&lt;ref name=&quot;DurkheimandCoser1997&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile, and Lewis A. Coser. 1997. The Division of Labor in Society. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim proposed that pre-industrial societies maintained their social solidarity through a mechanistic sense of community and through their religious affiliations. Most people were generalists in their work – they farmed and created their own tools and clothing. Because they were alike in their generality, they were also more likely to share a sense of community, which Durkheim saw as an important component of happiness. In addition to their similarity in occupations, many individuals belonged to the same religious groups, which also fostered a sense of solidarity.

In industrializing societies, Durkheim recognized the inevitability of ''specialization''. By definition, specialization means that individuals are going to have dissimilar occupations. This specialization would also affect religion. In industrial societies, religion would become just one aspect of lives that were increasingly divided into compartments – home, family, work, recreation, religion, etc.

Durkheim believed there were two components that would alleviate the decreasing social solidarity in industrializing societies: organic solidarity and conscientious attempts to find camaraderie through one's place of employment. Whereas social solidarity was maintained in pre-industrial societies through a mechanistic sense of similarity and dependence along with communal religious affiliations, in industrialized societies, social solidarity would be maintained by the interdependence of specialists on one another. If one individual specialized in treating the injured or ill, they would not have time to raise crops or otherwise produce food. Doctors would become dependent on farmers for their food while farmers would become dependent on doctors for their healthcare. This would force a type of organic solidarity — organic in the sense that the parts were interdependent like the organs of an animal are interdependent for their survival.

In addition to the inevitable interdependence a specialized society would warrant, Durkheim believed that a conscientious effort to develop and foster friendships would transition from a religious brotherhood to friendships developed at one's place of employment. Specialized individuals would have a great deal in common with their co-workers and, like members of the same religious congregations in pre-industrial societies, co-workers would be able to develop strong bonds of social solidarity through their occupations. Thus, for Durkheim, the answer to the decrease in mechanistic solidarity and the increasing anomie was organic solidarity and solidarity pursued within one's speciality occupation.

==Conclusion==
Sociologists have observed increases in surpluses of goods, densities of populations, the division of labor, technological advances, as well as inequality as societies have transitioned from one stage of societal development to the next. Weber, Marx, and Durkheim, focusing specifically on the transition from pre-industrial societies to the industrialized societies that they were witnessing during their lifetime, argued that there was also increased rationalization and bureaucratization, greater alienation from the fruits of labor and from each other, and the shift from mechanic solidarity to organic solidarity, respectively. However, what sociologists in the past did not anticipate was the dramatic effects of globalization on societal development. In the face of rapid globalization today, there are some societies that are currently straddling multiple stages of societal development like the Maasai people discussed at the beginning of the chapter, while others may have skipped over stages entirely. How can our existing understanding of societal development and social change be improved to account for these anomalies? How does globalization fit into existing views of societal development and social change? As societies continue to alter, modify, and transform with changing times, they offer new objects of study for sociologists in which prevailing theories can be improved.

| The well-known playwright, [[w:William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]], wrote in 1597, “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose. By any other name would smell just as sweet.” Later in 1913, [[w:Gertrude Stein|Gertrude Stein]] penned the often-quoted phrase, “A rose is a rose is a rose.” Although centuries apart, both Shakespeare and Stein were essentially making the same intellectual point that “things are what they are,” but are they really? Is the world around us truly that simple? For instance, &quot;Is a cow, a cow, a cow?&quot;

Beef hot dogs, hamburgers, and steaks have become a major part of American culture. These culinary delights can easily be found anywhere from athletic stadiums to fine dining establishments. The U.S. has become one of the biggest consumers of beef and beef products. Americans now consume about 200 billion pounds of beef each year. That equates to ten times more beef than what Asian Indians on the other side of the globe consume annually. This is despite the fact that the U.S. population is roughly three times smaller than that of India’s. As one might expect, all kinds of different cuts of beef can easily be found in U.S. grocery stores. In contrast, most states in India still ban the slaughter of cows outright. Article 48 of India’s constitution declares, “The State shall endeavor to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall, in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.” As one can see, the Asian Indian culture’s perspective on the cow is very different from that of the American culture. In India, the cow is seen as a sacred animal rather than an epicurean treat according to Hinduism, which is still the largest religion in the country.

It is through cross-cultural comparisons that we observe a notable divergence in not only the perception, but also the consumption of cows. So, is a cow, a cow, a cow? Sociologists would argue that a cow is not necessarily a cow, and that cultural variation ultimately dictates our assessment and treatment of things in society. What we may devour here in the U.S., others may venerate outside of the U.S., just like the dogs that are beloved by so many Americans are a common food staple in other parts of the world. This chapter on culture explains what culture entails as well as its origins before moving onto a comparison of subcultures vs. countercultures and ethnocentrism vs. cultural relativism. The chapter concludes with theories of culture, potential for cultural change, and how sociologists research culture.

The simplest way to think about culture is to think about the distinction between [[w:Nature (innate)|nature]] (our [[w:biology|biology]] and [[w:genetics|genetics]]) and [[w:Nature_versus_nurture|nurture]] (our environment and surroundings that also shape our identities).  Because of our biology and genetics, we have a particular form and we have certain abilities.  But our biological nature does not exclusively determine who we are.  For that, we need culture.  Culture is the non-biological or social aspects of human life, basically anything that is learned by humans is part of culture.

The two individuals in the photos to the above right help illustrate this idea.  The naked human comes very close to representing nothing but nature.  Aside from the hair cut, which may or may not be a reflection of culture, the individual in the photo is simply human.  From the photo, it cannot be discerned which language he speaks, what he believes, what (if anything) he commonly wears, whether he has lots of education or little education, and so on.  In short, the naked individual is a reflection of his biology; we have no additional clues about who he is because he is missing cultural artifacts.  The other individual wearing a costume illustrates the addition of culture to the individual.  From the photo alone we can tell that this individual is trained in [[w:ballet|ballet]], a particular form of dance popular in certain parts of the world.  The clothing he is wearing is culture, and it tells us a great deal about this individual.  

Generally speaking, the following elements of social life are considered to be representative of human culture: &quot;stories, beliefs, media, ideas, works of art, religious practices, fashions, rituals, specialized knowledge, and common sense&quot; (p. xvi).&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;&gt;Griswold, Wendy. 2004. Cultures and Societies in a Changing World. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, examples of culture do not, in themselves, present a clear understanding of the concept of culture; culture is more than the object or behavior. Culture also includes,

:…norms, values, beliefs, or expressive symbols. Roughly, norms are the way people behave in a given society, values are what they hold dear, beliefs are how they think the universe operates, and expressive symbols are representations, often representations of social norms, values, and beliefs themselves. (p. 3)&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;

To summarize, culture encompasses objects and symbols, the meaning given to those objects and symbols, and the norms, values, and beliefs that pervade social life. &quot;The definition is understood to include two elements - that which differentiates one group or society from others and the concept of acquired or learned behavior&quot;. (p. 43)&lt;ref name=&quot;Gusfield2006&quot;&gt;Gusfield, Joseph R. Culture. Contexts. 2006; 5(1):43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keep in mind that, in any given society, culture is not necessarily rigid and totally uniform.  As is the case with most elements of social life, culture is relatively stable (thus it is functional in the structural-functionalist sense) but at the same time contested (in the conflict sense).&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler2008&quot;&gt;Butler, Judith. 2008. “Sexual politics, torture, and secular time.” The British Journal of Sociology 59:1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In fact, social theorists, such as [[w: Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault]], [[w: Peter Berger|Peter Berger]] and [[w: Thomas Luckmann|Thomas Luckmann]], [[w: Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman]], and [[w: George Herbert Mead|George Herbert Mead]], have long noted that [[w: language|language]] lies at the root of all human culture.  Since language is never static and relies upon continued use for its existence, culture is thus continuously negotiated &lt;ref&gt;Schwalbe, Michael, Sandra Godwin, Daphne Holden, Douglas Schrock, Shealy Thompson, and  	Michelle Wolkomir.  2000.  “Generic Processes in the Reproduction of Inequality:  An  	Interactionist Analysis.”  Social Forces 79: 419-452.&lt;/ref&gt;, and thus may remain relatively stable and / or change rapidly in relation to the ongoing linguistic negotiations and developments within groups, organizations, institutions, and societies.  

==='High' Culture===
[[Image:Jeziorolabedzie.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Ballet, traditionally considered ''high'' culture.]]

Many people today think of ''culture'' in the way that it was thought of in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries.  This concept of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world.  This understanding of culture equates ''culture'' with ''civilization'' and contrasts both with ''nature'' or non-civilization.  According to this understanding of culture, some countries are more civilized than others, and some people are more cultured than others.  Theorists like Matthew Arnold (1822-1888) believed that culture is simply that which is created by &quot;the best that has been thought and said in the world&quot; (p. 6).&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold1882&quot;&gt;Arnold, Matthew, Culture and Anarchy, 1882. Macmillan and Co., New York. Online at [http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_titlepage.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Anything that doesn't fit into this category is labeled as chaos or anarchy. From this perspective, culture is closely tied to cultivation, which is the progressive refinement of human behavior. 

In practice, ''culture'' referred to [[w:elite|elite]] goods and activities such as [[w:haute cuisine|haute cuisine]], [[w:fashion|high fashion]] or [[w:haute couture|haute couture]], museum-caliber art and classical music. The word ''cultured'' referred to people who knew about and took part in these activities. For example, someone who used ''culture'' in this sense might argue that classical music is more refined than music by working-class people, such as [[w:jazz|jazz]] or the indigenous music traditions of aboriginal peoples.

People who use ''culture'' in this way tend not to use it in the plural. They believe that there are not distinct cultures, each with their own internal logic and values, but rather only a single standard of refinement to which all groups are held accountable. Thus people who differ from those who believe themselves to be ''cultured'' in this sense are not usually understood as ''having a different culture''; they are understood as being ''uncultured''.

===The Changing Concept of Culture===
During the [[w:Romantic era|Romantic Era]], scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with [[w:nationalism|nationalism]], developed a more inclusive notion of culture as ''worldview''.  That is, each ethnic group is characterized by a distinct and incommensurable world view. Although more inclusive, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between ''civilized'' and ''primitive'' or ''tribal'' cultures.

By the late 19th century, [[w:anthropology|anthropologists]] had changed the concept of culture to include a wider variety of societies, ultimately resulting in the concept of culture outlined above - objects and symbols, the meaning given to those objects and symbols, and the norms, values, and beliefs that pervade social life.  

This new perspective has also removed the evaluative element of the concept of culture and instead proposes distinctions rather than rankings between different cultures.  For instance, the ''high'' culture of elites is now contrasted with [[w:Popular culture|''popular'' or ''pop culture'']]. In this sense, ''high'' culture no longer refers to the idea of being ''cultured'', as all people are cultured. ''High'' culture simply refers to the objects, symbols, norms, values, and beliefs of a particular group of people; popular culture does the same.

Most social scientists today reject the ''cultured vs. uncultured'' concept of culture.  Instead, social scientists accept and advocate the definition of culture outlined above as being the &quot;nurture&quot; component of human social life.  Social scientists recognize that non-elites are as cultured as elites (and that non-Westerners are just as civilized); they simply have a different culture.  Further, recent studies have demonstrated that highly valued notions of culture are often produced via the strategic use of existing tastes, preferences, and patterns of social inequality, which, rather than demonstrating refinement or progress, actually reveal existing power relations within and between socio-political structures &lt;ref name=&quot;Koontz2010&quot;&gt;Koontz, Amanda. 2010. “Constructing Authenticity: A Review of Trends and Influences in the Process of Authenticating Cultural Products.” Sociology Compass 11(4): 977-988.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

====The Origins of Culture====
[[Image:Taipei Eye cropped p1090701.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chinese Opera, a culture tradition quite distinct from European Opera.]]

Attentive to the theory of [[w:evolution|evolution]], anthropologists assumed that all human beings are equally evolved, and the fact that all humans have cultures must in some way be a result of human evolution.  They were also wary of using biological evolution to explain differences between specific cultures - an approach that either was a form of, or legitimized forms of, [[w:racism|racism]].  Anthropologists believed biological evolution produced an inclusive notion of culture, a concept that anthropologists could apply equally to non-literate and literate societies, or to nomadic and to sedentary societies.  They argued that through the course of their evolution, human beings evolved a universal human capacity to classify experiences, and encode and communicate them symbolically. Since these symbolic systems were learned and taught, they began to develop independently of biological evolution (in other words, one human being can learn a belief, value, or way of doing something from another, even if they are not biologically related).  That this capacity for symbolic thinking and social learning is a product of human evolution confounds older arguments about [[w:nature versus nurture|nature versus nurture]].  Thus, [[w:Clifford Geertz|Clifford Geertz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Geertz1973&quot;&gt;Geertz, Clifford. (1973). The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays. New York. ISBN 0465097197.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that human physiology and neurology developed in conjunction with the first cultural activities, and Middleton (1990:17 n.27) concluded that human &quot;''instincts'' were culturally formed.&quot;

This view of culture argues that people living apart from one another develop unique cultures. However, elements of different cultures can easily spread from one group of people to another.  Culture is dynamic and can be taught and learned, making it a potentially rapid form of [[w:adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] to changes in physical conditions.  Anthropologists view culture as not only a product of biological evolution but as a supplement to it; it can be seen as the main means of human adaptation to the natural world. 

This view of culture as a symbolic system with adaptive functions, which varies from place to place, led anthropologists to conceive of different cultures as defined by distinct patterns (or structures) of enduring, although arbitrary, conventional sets of meaning, which took concrete form in a variety of artifacts such as [[w:myth|myths]] and [[w:ritual|rituals]], [[w:tool|tools]], the design of housing, and the planning of villages. Anthropologists thus distinguish between '''material culture''' and '''symbolic culture''', not only because each reflects different kinds of human activity, but also because they constitute different kinds of data that require different methodologies to study.

This view of culture, which came to dominate anthropology between World War I and World War II, implied that each culture was bounded and had to be understood as a whole, on its own terms.  The result is a belief in [[w:cultural relativism|cultural relativism]], which suggests that there are no &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; cultures, just different cultures.

Recent research suggests that human culture has reversed the causal direction suggested above and influenced human evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laland2010&quot;&gt;Laland, Kevin N., John Odling-Smee, and Sean Myles. 2010. “How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together.” Nat Rev Genet 11:137-148.&lt;/ref&gt;  One well-known illustration of this is the rapid spread of genetic instructions that left on a gene that produces a protein that allows humans to digest lactose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laland2010&quot;/&gt;  This adaptation spread rapidly in Europe around 4,000 BCE with the domestication of mammals, as humans began harvesting their milk for consumption.  Prior to this adaptation, the gene that produces a protein allowing for the digestion of lactose was switched after children were weaned.  Thus, the change in culture - drinking milk from other mammals - eventually led to changes in human genetics.  Genetics has, therefore, resulted in culture, which is now acting back on genetics.

===Level of Abstraction===
Another element of culture that is important for a clear understanding of the concept is [[w:Abstraction (sociology)|level of abstraction]].  Culture ranges from the concrete, cultural object (e.g., the understanding of a work of art) to micro-level interpersonal interactions (e.g., the socialization of a child by his/her parents or guardians) to a macro-level influence on entire societies (e.g., the Puritanical roots of the U.S. that can be used to justify the exportation of democracy – a lá the Iraq War).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wald2003&quot;&gt;Wald, Kenneth D. 2003. Religion and Politics in the United States. Fourth ed. New york: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important when trying to understand the concept of culture to keep in mind that the concept can have multiple levels of meaning, and that each of these levels may continuously act upon one another in complex ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourdieu1984&quot;&gt;Pierre Bourdieu. Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, trans. Richard Nice, 1984. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Artificiality of Cultural Categorization===
One of the more important points to understand about culture is that it is an artificial categorization of elements of social life.  As Griswold puts it, 

:There is no such thing as ''culture'' or ''society'' out there in the real world. There are only people who work, joke, raise children, love, think, worship, fight, and behave in a wide variety of ways. To speak of culture as one thing and society as another is to make an analytical distinction between two different aspects of human experience. One way to think of the distinction is that culture designates the expressive aspect of human existence, whereas society designates the relational (and often practical) aspect. (p. 4)&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;

In the above quote, Griswold emphasizes that culture is distinct from society but affirms that this distinction is, like all classifications, artificial.  Humans do not experience culture in a separate or distinct way from society.  Culture and society are truly two-sides of a coin; a coin that makes up social life.  Yet the distinction between the two, while artificial, is useful for a number of reasons.  For instance, the distinction between culture and society is of particular use when exploring how norms and values are transmitted from generation to generation and answering the question of cultural conflict between people of different cultural backgrounds (say, the [[w:Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[w:American|Americans]]).  Further, the distinction is useful for explicating the historical development of specific social structures, and the persistence or demise of social inequalities within and between societies. &lt;ref name=&quot;Foucault1977&quot;&gt;Foucault, Michel.  1977.  Discipline and Punish:  The Birth of the Prison.  Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subcultures &amp; Countercultures==
[[File:Trekkies at baycon 2003.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Trekkies (or fans of Star Trek) are a subculture; they share specific understandings and meanings that those outside their subculture may not understand.]]

A '''subculture''' is a culture shared and actively participated in by a minority of people within a broader culture. A culture often contains numerous subcultures. Subcultures incorporate large parts of the broader cultures of which they are part, but in specifics they may differ radically. Some subcultures achieve such a status that they acquire a name of their own. Examples of subcultures could include: [[w:bikers|bikers]], [[w:military of the United States|military culture]], [[w: Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony|Bronies]], and [[w:Society and Star Trek|Star Trek]] fans ([[w:trekkie|trekkers or trekkies]]).

[[File:Colorado City 8-13-2008 2-06-58 PM.JPG|thumb|150px|right|The woman and children in this photo are members of [[w:The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (or FLDS), which advocates the practice polygamy, making members part of a countercultural group (polygamy is illegal in the United States).]]

A '''counterculture''' is a subculture with the addition that some of its beliefs, values, or norms challenge or even contradict those of the main culture of which it is part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roszak1968&quot;&gt;Roszak, Theodore, The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition, 1968/1969, Doubleday, New York, ISBN 0385073291; ISBN 978-0385073295.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of countercultures in the U.S. could include: [[w:hippie|the hippie movement of the 1960s]], [[w:green movement|the green movement]], [[w:polygamy|polygamists]], [[w:feminism|feminist groups]], [[w: BDSM|BDSM Communities]], and [[w: LGBT|LGBTQ communities]].

Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hebdige1979&quot;&gt;Hebdige, Dick (1979). Subculture: The Meaning of Style (Routledge, March 10, 1981; softcover ISBN 0-415-03949-5).&lt;/ref&gt;  Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members. The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors. Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and [[w:argot|argot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hebdige1979&quot;/&gt;

==Ethnocentrism &amp; Cultural Relativism==
'''Ethnocentrism''' is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one's own culture. Many claim that ethnocentrism occurs in every society; ironically, ethnocentrism may be something that all cultures have in common.

The term was coined by William Graham Sumner, a social evolutionist and professor of Political and Social Science at Yale University. He defined it as, &quot;The sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner1919&quot;&gt;William Graham Sumner, War and Other Essays, ed. Albert Galloway Keller (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnocentrism often entails the belief that one's own race or ethnic group is the most important and/or that some or all aspects of its culture are superior to those of other groups. Within this ideology, individuals will judge other groups in relation to their own particular ethnic group or culture, especially with concern to language, behaviour, customs, and religion. It also involves an incapacity to acknowledge that cultural differentiation does not imply inferiority of those groups who are ethnically distinct from one's own.

Sociologists study ethnocentrism because of its role in various elements of social life, ranging from politics to terrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juergensmeyer2003&quot;&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark. 2003. Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence, 3rd Edition. 3rd ed. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also an area where sociologists often become advocates as they attempt to reveal ethnocentric biases to those who hold them with the aim of helping people realize that such biases are seldom beneficial to social solidarity and peaceful human relations.

'''Cultural relativism''' is the belief that the concepts and values of a culture cannot be fully translated into, or fully understood in, other languages; that a specific [[w:cultural artifact|cultural artifact]] (e.g. a ritual) has to be understood in terms of the larger symbolic system of which it is a part.

An example of cultural relativism might include slang words from specific languages (and even from particular dialects within a language).  For instance, the word ''tranquilo'' in Spanish translates directly to 'calm' in English.  However, it can be used in many more ways than just as an adjective (e.g., the seas are calm). Tranquilo can be a command or suggestion encouraging another to ''calm down''.  It can also be used to ease tensions in an argument (e.g., everyone relax) or to indicate a degree of self-composure (e.g., I'm calm). There is not a clear English translation of the word, and in order to fully comprehend its many possible uses a cultural relativist would argue that it would be necessary to fully immerse oneself in cultures where the word is used.

==Theories of Culture==
While there are numerous theoretical approaches employed to understand 'culture', this chapter uses just one model to illustrate how sociologists understand the concept.  The model is an integrationist model advocated by Ritzer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritzer2004&quot;&gt;Ritzer, George and Douglas J. Goodman. 2004. Modern Sociological Theory. sixth ed. Boston, MA: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritzer proposes four highly interdependent elements in his sociological model: a macro-objective component (e.g., society, law, bureaucracy), a micro-objective component (e.g., patterns of behavior and human interaction), a macro-subjective component (e.g., culture, norms, and values), and a micro-subjective component (e.g., perceptions, beliefs).  This model is of particular use in understanding the role of culture in sociological research because it presents two axes for understanding culture: one ranging from objective (society) to subjective (culture and cultural interpretation); the other ranging from the macro-level (norms) to the micro-level (individual level beliefs). 

[[Image:Ritzers integration theory.svg|center|George Ritzer's macro/micro integration theory of social analysis.]]

If used for understanding a specific cultural phenomenon, like the displaying of abstract art,&lt;ref name=&quot;Halle1993&quot;&gt;Halle, David. 1993. Inside Culture: Art and Class in the American Home. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this model depicts how cultural norms can influence individual behavior.  This model also posits that individual level values, beliefs, and behaviors can, in turn, influence the macro-level culture.  This is, in fact, part of what David Halle finds: while there are certainly cultural differences based on class, they are not unique to class.  Displayers of abstract art tend not only to belong to the upper-class, but also are employed in art-production occupations.  This would indicate that there are multiple levels of influence involved in art tastes – both broad cultural norms and smaller level occupational norms in addition to personal preferences.

===The Function of Culture===
Culture can also be seen to play a specific function in social life.  According to Griswold, &quot;The sociological analysis of culture begins at the premise that culture provides orientation, wards off chaos, and directs behavior toward certain lines of action and away from others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;  Griswold reiterates this point by explaining that, &quot;Groups and societies need collective representations of themselves to inspire sentiments of unity and mutual support, and culture fulfills this need.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt; In other words, culture can have a certain utilitarian function – the maintenance of order as the result of shared understandings and meanings.

On the other hand, culture can also function to create and sustain social inequalities.  According to Collins, &lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2005&quot;&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill.  2005.  Black Sexual Politics:  African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism.  Routlege.&lt;/ref&gt; cultural notions of race, class, gender, and sexualities may be used to explain and justify societal level patterns of oppression and privilege by allowing social beings to believe existing inequalities simply reflect the way things have always been.  As a result, efforts for social justice and equality must often overcome cultural patterns that lead dominants and subordinates to blindly accept existing social orders as natural or inevitable.  Following Collins, sociologists thus explore whether or not the shared understandings and meanings maintained via cultural practice resist and / or reproduce the ongoing subordination of minority groups.

==Cultural Change==
The belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. Resistance can come from habit, religion, science, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerson2001&quot;&gt;Emerson, Michael O., and Christian Smith. 2001. Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, men and women have complementary roles in many cultures. One sex might desire changes that affect the other, as happened in the second half of the 20th century in western cultures (see, for example, the [[w:feminist movement|women's movement]]), while the other sex may be resistant to that change (possibly in order to maintain a power imbalance in their favor).  Further, the demarcation of human beings into only two sexes (e.g., males and females) culturally erases the biological and genetic reality of [[w: Intersex|intersex people]], and justifies the genital mutilation of people born genetically beyond male/female classification schemes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haas2004&quot;&gt;Haas, Kate.  2004.  Who will make room for the Intersexed?  American Journal of Law and Medicine 30(1): 41 - 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Changing scientific and medical practices of infant genital mutilation in the case of intersex individuals, however, remains difficult due to cultural beliefs promoting and enforcing two sexes with separate but &quot;complementary&quot; roles.  

[[File:Ankh-Mirror-TutanchamunTomb.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The symbol of the ankh has its roots in Egyptian religious practice, but the symbol diffused over time and was adopted by other groups, including pagans, as a religious symbol.]]

Cultural change can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures. For example, the end of the last ice age helped lead to the invention of agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond2005&quot;&gt;Diamond, Jared. 2005. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. 1st ed. W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Another invention that substantially changed culture was the development of the [[w:birth control pill|birth control pill]], which changed women's attitudes toward sex.  Prior to the introduction of the birth control pill, women were at a high risk of pregnancy as a result of sex.  After the introduction of birth control pills, risk of pregnancy was substantially reduced, increasing heterosexual people's willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of wedlock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the introduction of the television substantially reduced American involvement in civic life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several understandings of how cultures change come from Anthropology.  For instance, in [[w:diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion theory]], the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the [[w:Ankh|ankh symbol]] originated in Egyptian culture but has diffused to numerous cultures.  It's original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of [[w:New Age|New Age Religion]] as an arcane symbol of power or life forces.

Contact between cultures can also result in [[w:acculturation|acculturation]]. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another (through force, negotiation, and / or agreement), such as what happened with many [[w:Native American|Native American Indians]] as Europeans took over their lands. Many Native Americans were acculturated into European norms, beliefs, and values, from religion to how to raise children because Europeans believed Natives could not adopt these cultural practices.  When Natives proved able to practice religion and parenthood in non-European ways, however, many of them were put to death, sent to conditioning camps, and / or moved into uncultivated western lands where they were required to form their own communities based on European values and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loewen1995&quot;&gt;Loewen, James W.  1995.  Lies my Teacher Told me.  The New Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Related processes on an individual level are [[w:assimilation|assimilation]] and [[w:transculturation|transculturation]], both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual, which may occur through force and / or choice.

Griswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt; Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals, but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture.  The author presents a sociological perspective to address this conflict,

:Sociology suggests an alternative to both the unsatisfying ''it has always been that way'' view at one extreme and the unsociological ''individual genius'' view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations.  We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p. 53)  

Griswold suggests, then, that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture (see also the discussion of Symbolic Interaction earlier in this text).  The logic is a bit circular, but it illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.  

It is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, &quot;there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was&quot;).  Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society.  This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue.  Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural beings).  Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leakey1996&quot;&gt;Leakey, Richard. 1996. The Origin of Humankind. New York: BasicBooks.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning.  This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do.

==Cultural Sociology: Researching Culture==
How do sociologists study culture?  One approach to studying culture falls under the label 'cultural sociology', which combines the study of culture with cultural understandings of phenomena. Griswold explains how cultural sociologists approach their research, 

:...if one were to try to understand a certain group of people, one would look for the expressive forms through which they represent themselves to themselves... The sociologist can come at this collective representation process from the other direction, from the analysis of a particular cultural object, as well; if we were to try to understand a cultural object, we would look for how it is used by some group as representing that group. (p. 59)&lt;ref name=&quot;Griswold2004&quot;/&gt;

Cultural sociologists look for how people make meaning in their lives out of the different cultural elements that surround them. A particularly clear example of cultural sociology is the study of the Village-Northton by Elijah Anderson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson1990&quot;&gt;Anderson, Elijah. 1990. Streetwise: Race, Class, and Change in an Urban Community. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anderson is interested in a number of things in his book, but two cultural components stand out.  First, Anderson is looking at the border of two culturally and socio-economically distinct neighborhoods.  Because these two neighborhoods are distinct yet share a border, this research site provides numerous opportunities for the exploration of culture.  Not surprisingly, cultural conflict is an optimal scenario for the exploration of culture and cultural interaction.  Additionally, Anderson is interested in how individuals in these neighborhoods negotiate interpersonal interactions, especially when individuals from the Village (middle to upper-middle class and predominantly white) are forced to interact with members of the Northton area (lower class and poor blacks).  

Anderson’s methodology is a combination of participant observation and interviews.  But when viewed in light of the quote above by Griswold, it becomes apparent that Anderson’s focus in these interviews and observations is [[w:self-presentation|self-presentation]].  Anderson regularly describes the individuals he interviews and observes in light of their clothing, behavior, attitudes, beliefs, and opinions.  As he interacts with more and more individuals, patterns begin to develop.  Specifically, individuals dressed in certain outfits behave in similar ways.  For instance, those dressed in business attire (even when walking their dogs) – [[w:yuppie|the yuppies]] – have particular perspectives on the future of the Village: they are interested in increasing property values in order to maximize their investment.  Another example of cultural significance of clothing is older black men who intentionally wear button-up shirts and ties because of the cultural symbolism of that particular outfit: it signifies to the cultural outsider that the wearer is refined and distinct from the athletic-suit-wearing drug dealers who control numerous Northton corners.

Ultimately, Anderson’s goal is to develop a sort of typology of ''streetwise'' individuals: people who can manage awkward and uncomfortable interpersonal interactions on the street in such a fashion that they emerge from the interactions unharmed.  While he does develop a loose description of these types of individuals, the important part to understand here is how he explores these aspects of culture.  First, he found a cultural border that presented cultural conflict.  When individuals have to negotiate meaning publicly, it makes it much easier for the sociologist to tease out culture.  Additionally, Anderson observed both the transmission of culture from generation to generation (i.e., [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|socialization]], but also the self-representation that is provided by cultural expressions (clothing, behavior, etc).  Through years of observation, Anderson gained a familiarity with these elements of culture that allowed him to understand how they interacted.

==Conclusion==
So what is culture? Understood most simply as a way of life of a particular society, culture entails a variety of aspects that include, but are not limited to: norms, values, beliefs, or expressive symbols. Consequently, culture can encompass anything that provides meaning or can be given meaning among a group of people. As illustrated at the beginning of the chapter, there may be different meanings attached to the same object or symbol depending on the culture at hand. The cow, which can be found across the globe, is an edifying illustration of this point. Each culture has its own interpretation of what a cow is and means. In the U.S., we most often see a cow as something to eat in our daily life, but in India, many people see a cow as something to revere in their spiritual life. However, culture is not static. It is vulnerable to change, sometimes at a slow pace that is less visible and sometimes at a fast pace that is much more observable. For example, in the advent of globalization in recent years, there is some evidence that India has been moving towards greater consumption of beef and beef products. Only time will tell whether or not there will be a dramatic shift in Asian Indian culture with regard to its perception and treatment of cows due to globalization.

| On November 4, 1970, child welfare authorities discovered a 13-year-old child who had been locked up in a bedroom of a house in Arcadia, California for the majority of her life. The young girl, known to the public as [[w:Genie_(feral_child)|Genie]] (a pseudonym), was one of the worst cases in recorded history of extreme abuse, neglect, and social isolation. From the age of about 20 months until authorities found her at the age of 13 years and 7 months, Genie had been mostly strapped to a child’s toilet or bound to a crib in addition to being severely malnourished. Her father, who had believed that Genie was mentally-retarded, had decided to isolate her and forbade the family from interacting with her. She consequently lacked any form of socialization since she was a toddler and had suffered mentally from the social deprivation. Psychologists, linguists, and other scientists began studying Genie’s case of near-total isolation. Many of them determined that the absence of socializing opportunities in the early years of her life had led her to missing the critical period of language acquisition, and that Genie ultimately remained unable to fully acquire the use of language.

Although Genie’s case is one of the most well-known cases of social isolation, there have been many other documented or alleged cases of feral children in history since the 14th century. These cases throughout time illustrate the importance of socialization among humans. Many have involved alternative socialization experiences with animals in the absence of human interaction. One recently-documented case involves [[w:Oxana_Malaya|Oxana Malaya]] in Ukraine in the 1980s. From about the age of three to the age of eight, Oxana began living with the family’s dogs after her alcoholic parents had forgotten her outside one evening. When authorities found her, she was running around on all fours and barking like her canine companions. However, through resocialization, Oxana was able to subdue her dog-like behaviors and eventually learned to speak Russian. Despite her progress, she remained somewhat intellectually-impaired due to the years of neglect and absence of human socialization.

Both Genie and Oxana’s well-known cases of extreme isolation demonstrate the importance of human interaction in the socialization process among people. This chapter on socialization introduces the different types of socialization as well as the need for socialization among humans in general. It goes on to provide the various theoretical understandings of socialization before discussing some key studies on the topic.

==Elements of Socialization==
Socialization is a fundamental sociological concept, comprising a number of elements.  While not every sociologist will agree which elements are the most important, or even how to define some of the elements of socialization, the elements outlined below should help clarify what is meant by socialization. 

===Goals of Socialization===
[[Image:AF-kindergarten.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A kindergarten in Afghanistan.]]

Arnett,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnett1995&quot;&gt;Arnett, Jeffrey J. 1995. Broad and Narrow Socialization: The Family in the Context of a Cultural Theory. ''Journal of Marriage and the Family'' 57( 3):617-28.&lt;/ref&gt; in presenting a new theoretical understanding of socialization (see below), outlined what he believes to be the three goals of socialization:
#impulse control and the development of a [[w:conscience|conscience]]
#role preparation and performance, including occupational roles, gender roles, and roles in institutions such as marriage and parenthood
#the cultivation of sources of meaning, or what is important, valued, and to be lived for

In short, socialization is the process that prepares humans to function in social life.  It should be re-iterated here that socialization is culturally relative - people in different cultures and people that occupy different racial, classed, gendered, sexual, and religious social locations are socialized differently.  This distinction does not and should not inherently force an evaluative judgement. Socialization, because it is the adoption of culture, is going to be different in every culture and within different subcultures. Socialization, as both process or an outcome, is not better or worse in any particular culture or subculture.

It should also be noted that, while socialization is a key sociological process in the development of individuals who can function in human society, not every aspect of human behavior is learned.  For instance, there is evidence that most children have innate empathy for individuals who are wilfully injured and consider it wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot; &quot;&gt;Decety, Jean, Kalina J. Michalska, and Yuko Akitsuki. 2008. Who caused the pain? An fMRI Investigation of Empathy and Intentionality in Children. Neuropsychologia. 46, 11:2607-2614.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, some aspects of human behavior that one might believe are learned, like empathy and morals, may, in fact, be biologically determined.  To what extent human behavior is biologically determined vs. learned is still an open question in the study of human behavior, but recent reviews of biological, genetic, neuroscience, and psychological literatures suggest that culture can influence biology and vice versa (e.g., nurture becomes nature through processes wherein learned responses and behaviors feed the development of the brain and the activation of genetic potential).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridgway2011&quot;&gt;Ridgeway, Cecilia L.  2011.  Framed by Gender:  How Gender Inequality Persists in the Modern World.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler1999&quot;&gt;Butler, Judith.  1999.

Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chrisler2002&quot;&gt;Chrisler, Joan and Paula Caplan. 2002. “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde: How PMS became a Cultural Phenomenon and Psychiatric Disorder.” Annual Review of Sex Research 13:274-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and Secondary Socialization===
Socialization is a life process, but is generally divided into two parts: ''Primary socialization'' takes place early in life, as a child and adolescent. ''Secondary socialization'' refers to the socialization that takes place throughout one's life, both as a child and as one encounters new groups that require additional socialization.  While there are scholars who argue that only one or the other of these occurs, most social scientists tend to combine the two, arguing that the basic or core identity of the individual develops during primary socialization, with more specific changes occurring later - secondary socialization - in response to the acquisition of new group memberships and roles and differently structured social situations. The need for later life socialization may stem from the increasing complexity of society with its corresponding increase in varied roles and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;/&gt;

Mortimer and Simmons outline three specific ways these two parts of socialization differ:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;/&gt;
#content - Socialization in childhood is thought to be concerned with the regulation of biological drives. In adolescence, socialization is concerned with the development of overarching values and the self-image. In adulthood, socialization involves more overt and specific norms and behaviors, such as those related to the work role as well as more superficial personality features.
#context - In earlier periods, the ''socializee'' (the person being socialized) more clearly assumes the status of ''learner'' within the context of the initial setting (which may be a family of orientation, an orphanage, a period of homelessness, or any other initial social groups at the beginning of a child's life), the school (or other educational context), or the peer group. Also, relationships in the earlier period are more likely to be affectively charged, i.e., highly emotional. In adulthood, though the socializee takes the role of student at times, much socialization occurs after the socializee has assumed full incumbency of the adult role. There is also a greater likelihood of more formal relationships due to situational contexts (e.g., work environment), which moderates down the affective component.
#response - The child and adolescent may be more easily malleable than the adult. Also, much adult socialization is self-initiated and voluntary; adults can leave or terminate the process at any time if they have the proper resources (symbolic, financial, and social) to do so.

Socialization is, of course, a social process.  As such, it involves interactions between people.  Socialization, as noted in the distinction between primary and secondary, can take place in multiple contexts and as a result of contact with numerous groups. Some of the more significant contributors to the socialization process are: parents, guardians, friends, schools, siblings or other family members, social clubs (like religions or sports teams), life partners (romantic or platonic), and co-workers. Each of these groups include a culture that must be learned and to some degree appropriated by the socializee in order to gain admittance to the group.

===Broad and Narrow Socialization===
Arnett proposed an interesting though seldom used distinction in types of socialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnett1995&quot;/&gt;  Arnett distinguishes between broad and narrow socialization:
*broad socialization is intended to promote independence, individualism, and self-expression; it is dubbed ''broad'' because this type of socialization has the potential of resulting in a broad range of outcomes
*narrow socialization is intended to promote obedience and conformity; it is dubbed ''narrow'' because there is a narrow range of outcomes

These distinctions correspond to Arnett's definition of socialization, which is: 
:the whole process by which an individual born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined with a much narrower range; the range of what is customary and acceptable for him according to the standards of his group

Arnett explains that his understanding of socialization should not be understood as having just two options, broad or narrow. Instead, the author argues that socialization can be broad or narrow within each of the seven socializing forces he outlines (e.g., family, friends, etc.).  Because each force can be either broad or narrow, there is a wide variety of possible broad/narrow socialization combinations.  Finally, Arnett notes two examples where his distinction is relevant.  First, Arnett argues that there are often differences in socialization by gender. Where these differences exist, argues Arnett, socialization tends to be narrower for women than for men (other sociologists have demonstrated similarities in other minority groups).  Arnett also argues that Japanese socialization is narrow as there is more pressure toward conformity in that culture. Arnett argues that this may account for the lower crime rates in Japan.

===Total Institutions===
[[Image:Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow 002.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A painting of a prison.]]

Not all socialization is voluntary nor is all socialization successful.  There are components of society designed specifically to resocialize individuals who were not successfully socialized to begin with.  For instance, prisons and mental health institutions are designed to resocialize people who are deemed to have not been successfully socialized.  Depending on the degree of isolation and resocialization that takes place in a given institution, some of these institutions are labeled ''total institutions''.  In his classic study of total institutions, Erving Goffman gives the following characteristics of total institutions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1961&quot; /&gt; 
#all aspects of life are conducted in the same place under the same authority 
#the individual is a member of a large cohort, all treated alike
#all daily activities (over a 24-hour period) are tightly scheduled
#there is a sharp split between supervisors and lower participants
#information about the member's fate is withheld

The most common examples of total institutions include mental hospitals, prisons, and military boot camps, though there are numerous other institutions that could be considered total institutions as well. The goal of total institutions is to facilitate a complete break with one's old life in order for the institution to resocialize the individual into a new life.

Mortimer and Simmons note a difference in socialization methodologies in different types of institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;/&gt;  When the goal of an institution is socialization (primary or secondary), the institution tends to use normative pressures. When the goal of an institution is resocialization of deviants, [[w:coercion|coercion]] is frequently involved.

In all such cases (and especially in total institutions), this process is accomplished by what Goffman called &quot;the mortification of the self,&quot; which refers to the processes whereby authority figures strip unwanted elements from the person under their care and / or control to fashion a type of self society deems acceptable or normative.  In the case of mental patients and military personnel, for example, new admissions to the institutions are stripped of their existing symbolic resources (e.g., fashion choices, schedules, methods of speech, etc.) so they may be re-fashioned in the image of the &quot;healthy patient&quot; or &quot;capable soldier.&quot;  Thus while much socialization involves learning and adopting new lessons, socialization often also involves the repression or suppression of individuality, prior cultural ties, and / or former patterns of behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1961&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving.  1961.  Asylums: Essays on the social situations of Mental Patients and other Inmates.  Doubleday Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1981&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving.  1981.  Forms of Talk.  University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Importance of Socialization===
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or wilful abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.  Such children are called &quot;[[w:Feral child|feral]]&quot; or wild.  Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment. Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away. Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own. When completely brought up by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular care-animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans. 

Feral children lack the basic social skills which are normally learned in the process of socialization. For example, they may be unable to learn to use a toilet, have trouble learning to walk upright and display a complete lack of interest in the human activity around them. They often seem mentally impaired and have almost insurmountable trouble learning a human language. The impaired ability to learn language after having been isolated for so many years is often attributed to the existence of a critical period for language learning, and taken as evidence in favor of the [[w:Critical Period Hypothesis|Critical Period Hypothesis]], and the examples of such children are often used to cast doubts upon potential biological and genetic determinants of human behavior and development.  It is very difficult to socialize a child who became isolated at a very young age into a relatively normal member of society and such individuals often need close care throughout their lives.

There are, unfortunately, a number of examples of such children that have been well-documented, including:

==Theoretical Understandings of Socialization==
Socialization, as a concept in social scientific research, has evolved over time. While the basic idea outlined above has been a component of most understandings of socialization, there have been quite a variety of definitions and theories of socialization. Some of these approaches are presented here as definitional variety is often informative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland1970&quot;&gt;Holland, David. 1970. Familization, Socialization, and the Universe of Meaning: An Extension of the Interactional Approach to the Study of the Family. ''Journal of Marriage and the Family'' 32(3):415-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortimer1978&quot;&gt;Mortimer, Jeylan T. and  Roberta G. Simmons. 1978. Adult Socialization. ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 4:421-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long1985&quot;&gt;Long, Theodore E. and Jeffrey K. Hadden. 1985. A Reconception of Socialization.  ''Sociological Theory'' 3(1):39-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Symbolic Interactionism - the self develops as a result of interrelated social interactions and interpretive processes; as a result, socialization is highly dependent on the situations in which the actor finds him/herself and the ways these situations are &quot;made sense of&quot; by the being or others; this approach also argues that socialization is a continuous, lifelong process
*Role Theory - socialization is seen as a process of acquisition of appropriate norms, attitudes, self-images, values, and role behaviors that enable acceptance in the group and effective performance of new roles; in this framework, socialization is seen as a conservative force, permitting the perpetuation of the social organization in spite of the turn-over of individual members through time
*Reinforcement Theory - the self develops as a result of cognitive evaluations of costs and benefits; this understanding assumes that the socializee, in approaching new roles, is an independent and active negotiator for advantages in relationships with role partners and membership groups
*Internalization Theory - socialization is a series of stages in which the individual learns to participate in various levels of organization of society; this theory contends that the child [[w:internalization|internalizes]] a cognitive frame of reference for interpersonal relations and a common system of expressive symbolism in addition to a moral conscience; this approach was advocated by [[w:Talcott Parsons|Talcott Parsons]]

Recent research&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2010&quot;&gt;Mark Nielsen and Keyan Tomaselli “Overimitation in Kalahari Bushman Children and the Origins of Human Cultural Cognition” in Psychological Science, May 2010, 21: 729-736.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that human children are hard-wired to exactly imitate the roles of adults, including actions that are not pragmatic. This is referred to as &quot;overimitation&quot; and, while seemingly maladaptive from an evolutionary perspective, it is possible that this is one of the characteristics of humans that facilitates the transmission of culture from generation to generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2010&quot;/&gt; Despite this possibility, however, arguments in this vein typically stress conformity among children, and ignore variation and deviance (especially in the context of minority groups).  

===Socialization as ''Joining Groups''===
Socialization has addressed the problem of individual adjustment to society. In all of the approaches outlined above, socialization has, in one way or another, referred to the idea that society shapes its members toward compliance and cooperation with societal requirements.  In order to reduce confusion, develop a research methodology for measuring socialization, and potentially lead to the comparability of research findings from different studies, Long and Hadden proposed a revised understanding of socialization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Long1985&quot;/&gt;  Rather than referring to a vague adoption or learning of culture, Long and Hadden reframed socialization as &quot;the medium for transforming newcomers into bona fide members of a group.&quot;  Before discussing some of the specifics of this approach, it may be useful to outline some of the critiques Long and Hadden present of earlier approaches to socialization.

According to Long and Hadden, many earlier approaches to socialization extended socialization to every part of human social life.  As a result, everyone becomes both a socializing agent (socializer) and a novice (socializee) in all encounters with others. This conceptualization leaves socialization without a social home; it is all around but no place in particular.  Another criticism of previous approaches is that they allowed socialization to include anything, and anything which is part of the process at one time may be excluded at another. With this conceptualization, any phenomenon may shift its status in the socialization process without changing its own composition or expression. In other words, socialization includes virtually everything, excludes almost nothing, and shifts with circumstance and outcomes.  Additionally, previous approaches to socialization lacked specificity about the nature of socialization activity. Defining socialization by its outcomes made it unnecessary to stipulate the nature of the process conceptually. Socialization could be attributed to ''this or that'' but in order to truly understand what is taking place it is necessary to go beyond just pointing to socializing agents and specify what it is about those agents that is doing the socializing. Another serious drawback of earlier approaches is that they disregard the ''process'' component of socialization. Doing so limits the socialization concept to employment primarily as a post hoc interpretive category that is used to lend significance to findings defined and developed in other terms.

As a result of these criticisms, Long and Hadden found themselves presented with a two-fold task:&lt;ref name=&quot;Long1985&quot;/&gt;
*locate socialization and its social boundaries more precisely
*specify the distinctive properties which distinguish it from related phenomena

To accomplish this, Long and Hadden developed a new understanding of socialization, &quot;socialization is the process of creating and incorporating new members of a group from a pool of newcomers, carried out by members and their allies&quot;.  Under this understanding, the principal agents of socialization are certified and practicing members of the group to which novices are being socialized. It should be noted that ''certified'' here is only a shortened way of saying &quot;a socially approved member of the group.&quot;  Thus, Long and Hadden's revised understanding of socialization sees it as both the process and outcome of joining groups.

==Research Examples==
Numerous examples of research on socialization could be presented in this section.  One important area of socialization research involves differences in gender socialization, but much of that research is summarized in the chapter on [[Introduction to Sociology/Gender|gender]].  The following three research examples are interesting in that they explore both primary and secondary socialization and do so from varying perspectives.

===Socialization and Social Class===
Ellis, Lee, and Peterson,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis1978&quot;&gt;Ellis, Godfrey J., Gary R. Lee, and Larry R. Petersen. 1978. Supervision and Conformity: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Parental Socialization Values. ''American Journal of Sociology'' 84(2):386-403.&lt;/ref&gt; developing a research agenda begun by Melvin L. Kohn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kohn1969&quot;&gt;Kohn, Melvin L. 1969. ''Class and Conformity, A Study in Values.'' Homewood, IL: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explored differences in how parents raise their children relative to their [[w:social class|social class]]. Kohn found that lower class parents were more likely to emphasize conformity in their children whereas middle-class parents were more likely to emphasize creativity and self-reliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kohn1969&quot;/&gt;  Ellis et. al. proposed and found that parents value conformity over self-reliance in children to the extent that conformity superseded self-reliance as a criterion for success in their own endeavors.  In other words, Ellis et. al. verified that the reason lower-class parents emphasize conformity in their children is because they experience conformity in their day-to-day activities.  For example, factory work is far more about conforming than innovation.

Another study in this same area explored a slightly different component of this relationship.  Erlanger was interested in a correlation between social class and physical violence.{{ref|Erlanger1974}}  While he did not find a strong correlation indicating lower class individuals were more likely to employ physical violence in punishing their children, he did present evidence concerning several outdated propositions.  Erlanger's findings include:
*physical punishment ''does not'' lead to ''working class authoritarianism''
*childhood punishment experiences ''do not'' explain the greater probability that working class adults, as opposed to middle class adults, will commit homicide
*general use of corporal punishment ''is not'' a precursor to child abuse
*use of corporal punishment ''is not'' part of a subcultural positive evaluation of violence

It should be noted that this is an older study and that more recent findings may have shed more light on these issues.  It should also be noted that Erlanger readily points out when his findings are strongly supported or weakly supported by his data.  It behooves the interested party to read his paper directly rather than rely on the summary above for the specific nuances.  Further, it is important to note that many of these findings (especially in relation to Kohn's original analyses) have also been verified in natural settings.  [[w: Annette Lareau|Annette Lareau]], for example, utilized interviews and participant observation with middle and working class parents to demonstrate two primary patterns of child rearing distinguished by class status - concerted cultivation and natural growth.  Specifically, she found that working class parents encouraged natural growth wherein their children were left more free to structure their own time, which facilitated greater development of creativity and wider friendship and familial networks, but also led to an emerging sense of social restraint.  On the other hand, she found that middle class parents practiced concerted cultivation wherein they intimately planned and scheduled their children's lives around extracurricular activities, which limited their children's friendship and familial networks, but facilitated an emerging sense of entitlement and important negotiation skills that could be transferred into educational and occupational advantages over the life course.

===Socialization and Death Preparation===
Marshall interviewed a number of retirement home residents to explore how their environment influenced their thinking about death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall1975&quot;&gt;Marshall, Victor W. 1975. Socialization for Impending Death in a Retirement Village. ''American Journal of Sociology'' 80(5):1124-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, Marshall was examining secondary socialization concerning mortality.  Marshall found that a combination of relationships, behavioral changes, and retirement home culture contributed to a conception of death that was both accepting and courageous.  

Residents of this particular retirement home found themselves with more time on their hands - to think about death - because they no longer had to care for their own homes.  Additionally, they found themselves surrounded by people in a situation similar to their own: they were basically moving into the retirement home to prepare for death.  The prevalence of elderly people facilitated discussions of death, which also helped socialize the residents into their acceptance of mortality.  Finally, the retirement home community encouraged a culture of life and fulfilment in part to counter-act the frequency of death.  Some residents calculated there was one death per week in the retirement home.  In light of such bad numbers, it was important to the success of the community to maintain a positive culture that embraced life yet accepted death.  In summary, Marshall found that numerous factors contributed to the socialization of residents into a positive lifestyle that was also accepting of and preparatory for their impending deaths.

===Do College Preparation Classes Make a Difference?===
Rosenbaum was interested in the effects of high school tracks on [[w:intelligence quotient|IQ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenbaum1975&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum, James E. 1975. The Stratification of Socialization Processes. ''American Sociological Review'' 40(1):48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;  High school tracks are the different levels or types of courses students can take; for instance, many high schools now include college preparation tracks and general education tracks.  Rosenbaum's hypothesis was that students who followed the lower tracks (non college-preparation) would score lower on IQ tests over time than would students who followed the higher tracks (college-preparation).  Considering that school is one of the primary contributors to socialization, it makes sense that participation in a given track can also result in the adoption of the norms, values, beliefs, skills, and behaviors that correspond to that track.  In other words, tracks can turn into a type of [[w:self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecy]]: you may start out at the same level as someone in a higher track, but by the time you have completed the lower track you will have become like the other students in your track.

To reduce confounding variables and ensure notable test effects, Rosenbaum selected a homogeneous, white, working class public school with five different, highly stratified classes.  Rosenbaum then compared IQ scores for individuals in the different tracks at two time points.  As it turns out, ''tracking'' does have a significant effect on IQ. People in lower tracks can actually see a decline in IQ compared to a possible increase among those in the upper track.  In other words, tracks socialize their students into their corresponding roles.

==Conclusion==
Socialization is the process by which humans learn how to function in a particular society. Although it is expected that all humans experience some form of socialization during their lives, there have been some rare instances throughout history in which individuals were either forced to live in social isolation, such as the cases of Genie, or undergo socialization through alternative means, such as the case of Oxana Malaya. Both cases were depicted at the beginning of the chapter and illustrate the importance of socialization in human development. Although socialization is observably essential among humans, it is important to note here that socialization is very much culturally-relative, meaning that the process and outcomes do vary from culture to culture. This is most evident in the diverse social norms existing throughout the world. How each of us are socialized in a particular society ultimately determines what we perceive as “normal” and “abnormal,” and even then, we are susceptible to resocialization depending on the changing circumstances of our social environment or social exposure.

| The speech today arose in a manner most Americans would find innocent enough, Jordin remarked as he began to speak to the assembled parents, kids and teachers.  In his school class the previous month, his son, Junior, challenged inaccurate teachings common in American classrooms over the past 100 years. The teacher had said that boys have a penis and girls do not.  Although Junior was only 7 years old, he grew up in a progressive, nonreligious household where his parents (both Native American biologists and activists by trade) encouraged him to ask questions, taught him all people were equal, and celebrated (rather than hiding) the human body by discussing it openly and embracing nudity at home.  As a result, Junior tried to explain to his teacher that both Mommy and Daddy had penises – Mommy had an innie, Junior had an outie, and Daddy had an innie and an outie because he grew his own penis naturally when he was a teenager.  The teacher was noticeably uncomfortable by what Junior said. (Junior described it to his father like this, “It looked like she wanted to yell at me, like when the Chicago Bears lose and Mommy gets loud.”) The teacher told Junior he was wrong and when he protested, the teacher sent him to the administration for discipline.

After relaying this story to the crowd, Jordin explained that as a child he had been born with a tiny “penis” that white American society – scientific or otherwise since the 1920’s though beginning in the late 1800's – would call a “clitoris.”  He then explained that whether we call the same organ a “clitoris or a penis” is generally decided based on measurements created by biologists based on religious teachings common in the Western world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kessler1998&quot;&gt;Kessler, S. J. (1998) Lessons From the Intersexed. Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  He further explained that this was similar to the ways many religious people will call a book “scriptures” instead of a “book” because they believe it is important to distinguish between the two even though there is no empirical difference between the two – each one contains written words created by people the same way that both a “clitoris” and a “penis” contain roughly the same genetic components.  Then, he explained how as a child he, like many other people in the world, turned his “clitoris” into a “penis” by ingesting specific chemical compounds, in much the same way people have for centuries. Similarly, he explained how other people consumed other chemical compounds to shrink their “penises” into “clitori.”  He further explained that this was similar other parts of the human body, like legs; the difference, of course, is that we don’t call “longer legs” by a new name, and we don’t call the legs of some people “legs” and the legs of other people “clegs.”

While Jordin offered many more examples of the ways we have created a mythology or religion called “sex” by naming or emphasizing this or that body part in certain ways, he further asked parents to imagine that their son or daughter suddenly became not a son or a daughter because a small group of people decided that only brown-eyed people could be sons and daughters, and their child did not have brown eyes. Using another example, he asked the audience to imagine if instead of ovaries or vaginas, we decided people were essentially different (e.g., “sexed”) based on whether or not they could roll their tongues, digest vegetables or meats, or any other of a million tiny biological variations throughout human existence that do not have to create social differences in our world.  Finally, he asked the audience what &quot;sex&quot; males who lose or have no use of their penises would be, and asked the same for females who are born without vaginal canals, ovaries, or other materials we decided matter. As Jordin illustrated, we still consider them members of the same &quot;sex&quot; categories even if they are missing what we say create the categories in the first place.

==Introduction==
Why do some people continue to teach children and adults beliefs about human anatomy that do not align with empirical reality?  Why did we create two names for the same genital organ, and why does it matter to people which name we use for which person?  Why do we promote an inaccurate version of human biological variation in our classrooms and research centers?  By the same token, why do people – even many trained in critical inquiry and scientific traditions – believe in these social constructs and use them to explain so much of our world?  Why did we choose genital variations instead of eye colors, hair colors or other biological variations to segregate people into different religious and scientific categories?  And finally, what consequences do our beliefs in sex – and by extension gender – have for individuals and the larger social world?

While social scientists have tackled these questions in many ways&lt;ref name=&quot;Schilt2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;West1987&quot;/&gt;, the sex/gender system remains one of the most powerful belief systems in our world today among both religious and scientific populations.  In this section, we introduce the components of sex/gender categorization systems, and explore some ways people make sense of these beliefs in their ongoing lives as well as the consequences of these social constructs have for the larger social world.

==Gender vs. Sex==
[[Image:Kathoy1649.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Transgender women performing in Thailand (known as [[w:Kathoey|Kathoey]] )]]

Sociologists make a distinction between '''gender''' and '''sex'''.  &quot;Gender&quot; refers to a person's perceived or projected social location within culturally established designations between masculine and feminine behaviors (e.g., gender refers to a person's attempt to signify a masculine or feminine self as well as a person's attempt to categorize someone else in terms of their presentation (intentional or otherwise) of masculine or feminine selfhood).  Sex, however, refers to a person's assignment, usually by medical, religious, familial, and / or governmental authorities, into categories socially constructed on the basis of perceived genetic and [[w:biological|biological]] factors (e.g., social elites place people into sex categories by interpreting genetic and biological components of said people).&lt;ref name=&quot;West1987&quot;&gt;West, Candace and Don H. Zimmerman.  1987.  Doing Gender.  Gender &amp; Society 1: 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cis vs. Trans===

Sociologists further distinguish between cis sex/gender people and trans sex/ gender people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumerau2013&quot;&gt;J. Edward Sumerau, Douglas Schrock, and Teri Jo Reese. 2013.  “Transsexuals’ Gendered Self- Presentations.” Pp. 245-160 in The Drama of Social Life: A Dramaturgical Handbook, edited by Charles Edgley. Ashgate, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cis sex/gender people are those who conform to the existing notions of sex and gender within a given social, historical, cultural, political, and scientific context.  A cissex male, for example, will be assigned male at birth (based on the interpretation of biological material), and will seek to remain male throughout the course of his life.  Similarly, a cisgender male will be assigned male at birth (based on the interpretation of biological material), and then seek to learn and display the symbols, codes, and cues (based upon existing gender norms in his society) to be interpreted (by himself and others) as first a boy and later a man; he will thus follow the script set forth for males in his social world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schilt2009&quot;&gt;Schilt, Kristen and Laurel Westbrook. 2009. “Doing Gender, Doing Heteronormativity: “Gender Normals,” Transgender People, and the Social Maintenance of Heterosexuality.” Gender &amp; Society 23: 440-464.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Trans sex/gender people are those who do not conform to the existing notions of sex and gender within a given social, historical, cultural, political, and scientific context.  A [[w:Trans man|transsex male]] (often referred to as a female-to-male transsexual), for example, will be assigned female at birth (based on the interpretation of biological material), but will seek to become male - via the use of hormones, bodily training, herbal mixtures, and/or surgeries - during the course of zir life.  Similarly, a transgender male (sometimes this person will also be a transsexual and other times this person will have no desire to transition sex categories) will be assigned female at birth (based on the interpretation of biological material), but then seek to learn and display the symbols, codes, and cues (based upon existing gender norms in his society) to be interpreted (by himself and others) as first a boy and later a man or as a boy/man sometimes and a girl/woman at other times.  In some societies and historical periods, trans sex/gender people are accepted, celebrated, and affirmed, but in other societies and historical periods, they are faced with constant scrutiny, harassment, and discrimination that has even been supported by scientific and religious institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schilt2009&quot;/&gt;  

To understand the dynamics of sex and gender as well as the distinctions between cis and trans experience, we will take a closer look at these elements within contemporary society throughout this chapter.

===Sex===

Scientific communities (especially since the late 1800's) have divided many [[w:species|species]] of living things into two mutually reinforcing categories based upon dominant interpretations (political, religious, and scientifically established) of genetic materials, reproductive capabilities, and genital composition.  Typically, these classification schemes have promoted the idea of two sexes:  &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;.  Within these schemes, females are defined as the sex that produces larger [[w:gamete|gametes]] (i.e., reproductive cell) and which bears the offspring. These schemes have therefore been built to match reproductive functions that an individual may perform during life cycles.  To establish these schemes, scientists simplified the empirical realities of human biology by formulating a typology of sex chromosomes labeled X and Y.  Within this typology, they assigned females two X chromosomes, and males an XY chromosome.  In fact, this socially constructed typology has become so well established that most people interpret and perceive &quot;sex&quot; as a dichotomous state.  

As noted previously, however, human biology is far more complex than this typology allows, and as a result, there are many genetic variations that are left out of these classification schemes (see the article on [[w: Intersex|Intersex]] here as well as the citation outlining intersex experience earlier in this text).  Further, most people are not genetically examined at birth, and standards for assigning people to male and female sexes are not uniform across social, situational, or historical contexts - generally, a doctor makes the decision as to what sex the child is, and the child is listed as such regardless of what genetic testing or other biological criteria might reveal.  Most clinical research and debates on the subject, for example, suggest that males are people born with a urethra at the tip of the phallus whereas females have it in the perineum, but in reality, people are born with urethral openings in a wide variety of locations between the phallus and perineum despite the fact that only a fraction of these births are labeled intersex (similar observations have been made concerning distinctions based on genital size, gamete size, chromosomal makeup, and other biological markers).  While the socially constructed dichotomy (e.g., male v. female) mirrors capitalistic hierarchies embedded within many post-industrial societies, it does not in fact match the biological reality of people, and thus sociologists examine what role the &quot;myth of distinct, dichotomous sexes&quot; plays in social patterning and structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler1999&quot;&gt;Butler, Judith.  1999.  Gender Trouble:  Feminism and the Subversion of Identity.  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roen2008&quot;&gt;Katrina Roen.  2008.  ““But we have to do Something”: Surgical Correction of Atypical Genitalia.”  Body and Society 14: 47 - 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside such complexity, human biology is incredibly susceptible to influence, mutation, and adjustment, and not surprisingly, &quot;sex&quot; is rather mutable.  As a result, historians have documented &quot;sex&quot; transition or change throughout human history, and noted the ability for one to transform and change &quot;sex&quot; in many different ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halberstam2005&quot;&gt;Halberstam, Judith M.  2005.  In a Queer Time and Place:  Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives.  New York, NY:  NYU Press.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haraway1991&quot;&gt;Haraway, Donna J. 1991. Simians, Cyborgs, and Women. NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the 1950's, for example, transitioning or changing &quot;sex&quot; categories was typically seen as a natural variation in human biology and experience in most of the world.  In search of greater market share in the 1950's, however, American and European medical authorities defined transsexuality as a disorder that required intervention and treatment by licensed professionals, and facilitated the classification of transsexuality as a psychological disorder that necessitated a specific narrative and therapeutic protocol prior to transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billings1982&quot;&gt;Billings, Dwight B. and Thomas Urban.  1982.  “The Socio-Medical Construction of Transsexualism: An Interpretation and Critique.”  Social Problems 29: 266-282.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, support groups and community centers sprung up in the 1980's (forming a national Transgender movement in the 1990's) to (a) teach people the story they would need to tell to acquire transexual services and identities, and (b) lobby medical and psychological communities to remove these newly added (or newly socially constructed) &quot;disorders&quot; from the record books (this process has been somewhat successful as transsexuality has been reinterpreted repeatedly throughout the last two decades and in some countries gained legal recognition and protection).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumerau2013&quot;/&gt;

At present, both intersex and transexuality are hotly debated topics within and between scientific communities.  While many (especially in the biological, psychological and medical sciences) still promote the &quot;two sexes&quot; or &quot;XX/XY&quot; model, these perspectives are increasingly demonstrated to be ideological rather than scientifically based forms of knowledge (see [[w: Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault]] for discussion of the socially constructed and political nature of all human knowledge).  As a result, debates continue wherein biological, medical, and psychological sciences attempt to maintain their hold on rather lucrative models of sex while many scholars in these and others fields attempt to return scientific understandings of &quot;sex&quot; to an empirical rather than ideological basis.

===Gender===

Similar to &quot;Sex,&quot; Gender is a socially constructed interpretation of human behavior patterns.  Specifically, gender refers to the ascription (by self or others) of differential social statuses based upon shared understandings of what constitutes masculine and/or feminine behavior.  As such, gender typically involves two interrelated components built upon the acceptance or rejection of societal norms concerning masculinities and femininities.  First, gender may refer to an internal feeling that one is a male, female, both, neither, and/or somewhere in between or beyond these categories.  Because [[w:gender role|gender]] is dependent upon behavioral expectations and norms, once individuals know those expectations and norms, the individual can adopt behaviors that project the gender he/she wishes to portray.  One can think of this side of gender like a role in a theatrical play - there are specific behaviors and norms associated with genders just like there are lines and movements associated with each character in a play.  Adopting the behaviors and norms of a gender leads to the perception that someone belongs in that gender category.  

Similar to a play, however, there is another component of gender - the audience.  In a play, performances are determined to be believable or not based upon audience reaction, and audiences typically arrive at performances with a pre-established set of expectations and ideas about what they will be witnessing.  Gender is thus also the external perception others develop of us (e.g., Do other people think and believe we are men and/or women?).  Since gender - like a play - is ultimately a human created fiction (e.g., a performance of shared understandings), it can only exist as long as others believe and approve of the performance.  As a result, people &quot;do gender&quot; throughout their lives by (a) aligning their actions to the preconceived gender beliefs of others, and (b) developing an awareness (consciously or otherwise) that everything they do may be interpreted as evidence (or lack thereof) of their position within a specific gender category.  Gender is thus an ongoing production dependent upon the reactions of others.  
 
Some examples may help illustrate the ways people learn to accomplish gender. Parents may socialize children into what is perceived as a traditionally masculine role, which includes characteristics like independence, courage, and aggressiveness while constantly reminding the child ze is supposed to be masculine by, for example, calling the child by gendered labels like &quot;boy&quot; or &quot;son&quot; and/or stopping the child when ze acts in non-masculine ways (e.g., boys don't do that).  Likewise, parents may socialize children into what is perceived as a traditionally feminine role that includes characteristics like submissiveness, emotionality, and empathy while constantly reminding the child that it is supposed to be feminine through the same means noted above. Further, others in the child's environment (like siblings, strangers, and peers) will often reinforce these beliefs and social control mechanisms throughout the child's interactions.  Assuming both of the aforementioned children never question their placement into these gender categories, the masculine child will learn to be a boy and a man and the feminine child will learn to be a girl and a woman by aligning their own behaviors to fit conventional gender norms over time.  Such individuals will develop cisgender identities.  For instance, the masculine child may play with toy soldiers, join athletic teams, and learn to prize appearing tough while the feminine child may play with dolls, bond with other feminine-behaving people, and learn that ze is rewarded for appearing to care.

However, gender - like sex - is fluid and can change.  This can be seen by continuing the above example.  It is possible for the masculine-raised child to decide later in life - or without the parents knowledge earlier in life - to engage in feminine behaviors, and the same could happen with the feminine-raised child (in fact, many parents raise children in gender neutral ways that allow the children to make these decisions from the start).  In so doing, the aforementioned children could adopt relatively varied behaviors that create an [[w:androgyny|androgynous]] or gender neutral self, or they could simply adopt the opposite (raised masculine, but decide to live feminine sometimes or all the time and vice versa) gender performances (see the image of drag queens for male people that adopt feminine expressions and behaviors sometimes).  Either change, however, would require (a) adopting different gender performances than those promoted and enforced by dominant social structures, and (b) risking ridicule, harassment, and discrimination at the hands of cisgender people (often referred to as [[w: cisgender|cissexism]] or [[w: transphobia|transphobia]]).

==Biological Differences==
While much of this chapter focuses on the socially constructed differences between men and women, it is also important to note there are some clear [[w:physiology|physiological]] differences between the two sexes.  While it is as yet unknown how or why these differences develop, scholars typically attempt to explain the differences in one of two ways.  Scientific disciplines tied more firmly to existing gender norms within a society, for example, typically argue that biological distinctions create these differences, and use these differences to argue that there are inherent differences between women and men (non cis-gender people are generally ignored completely by these fields and within their arguments).  On the other hand, more progressive and diverse scientific communities generally argue that these differences reflect existing gender inequalities within a given society, and thus merely demonstrate that the social construction of sex and gender has biological (as well as social) consequences.  While the emergence of bio-social mathematical models and critical examinations of scientific texts may shed light on this debate in the decades to come, at present the answers remain beyond empirical reach.  As a result, the following paragraphs outline these differences while also noting the ways that social factors may cause or influence such differences.  Keep in mind, however, that since these studies ignore trans sex/gender experience, we must limit our commentary to cisgender results only.  

In addition to different sex organs and sex chromosomes, the average male is 10 percent taller, 20 percent heavier, and 35 percent stronger in the upper body than the average female&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenreich1999&quot;&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara. 1999. &quot;The Real Truth about the Female Body.&quot; Time. Vol. 153, No. 9, pages 56-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that these physiological differences may have been influenced by social/cultural decisions in our evolutionary past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buss2003&quot;&gt;Buss, David M. 2003. The Evolution Of Desire - Revised Edition 4. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, when measured against their own body size, rather than on an absolute scale (e.g., how much females can carry relative to their body size versus how much males can carry relative to their body size), actual strength differences are minimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebben1998&quot;&gt;Ebben, William P. and Randall Jensen. 1998. &quot;Strength Training for Women: myths that block opportunity&quot;. The Physician and Sports Medicine 26(5): np.&lt;/ref&gt;

Females, for reasons still somewhat undetermined, tend to outlive males.  Female life expectancy in the U.S. is 79.8 years; for males it is 74.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/Default.htm U.S. National Center for Health Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe this difference is due to the riskier lifestyles of males that identify as men (e.g., pursue masculine behaviors), especially earlier in life, combined with their typically more physically stressing occupations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2003&quot;&gt;Williams, David R. 2003. “The Health of Men: Structured Inequalities and Opportunities.” Am J Public Health 93:724-731.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have noted the negative effects that stress and lack of emotional expression (a hallmark trait associated with masculinities) place on the body, and the tendency for females to seek help and treatment (traditionally feminine behaviors) as factors in this pattern.  

Behaviorally, age of sitting, teething, and walking all occur at about the same time in females and males.  However, males enter [[w:puberty|puberty]] on average two years later than females (it is important to note, however, that females have a clear sign (e.g., menarche) of puberty onset whereas males (and their parents) are generally uncertain of the exact onset of puberty, which could skew these interpretations).&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant1995&quot;&gt;Plant TM, Lee PA, eds. The Neurobiology of Puberty. Bristol: Society for Endocrinology, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no significant differences in intelligence, happiness, or self-esteem between males and females.  However, females are, statistically, twice as vulnerable to anxiety disorders and depression (possibly due to their experience as a subordinate or minority group within many societies), but only one-third as vulnerable to suicide and one-fifth as vulnerable to alcoholism (potentially due to traditional definitions of masculinities that link violence and substance abuse to masculinities).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor2000&quot;&gt;Cantor CH. Suicide in the Western World. In: Hawton K, van Heering K, eds. International handbook of suicide and attempted suicide. Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000: 9-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Females attempt suicide more often than males (mirroring patterns between other dominant and subordinate groups) but have lower rates of &quot;success&quot;, because their preferred methods do not involve firearms, unlike males (potentially due to the association of violence with masculinities). Females are also less likely to suffer hyperactivity or speech disorders as children or to display antisocial personalities as adults (potentially due to gender socialization wherein femininities are associated with social behaviors and communication skills).&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers1996&quot;/&gt;  Finally, females have slightly more olfactory receptors on average and are more easily re-aroused immediately after orgasm (potentially due to traditional associations of femininities to the pursuit of sexual pleasure and intimacy in relation to masculine associations with sexual conquest and performance).&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers1996&quot;&gt;Myers, David G. 1996. Social Psychology (Fifth Edition). McGraw Hill. ISBN 0071145087&lt;/ref&gt;

Much evidence has shown that there are differences in male and female brains. In fact, the temporal lobe, which is the part of the brain associated with language and emotion, develops up to 4 years earlier in females in comparison to boys (which mirrors patterns of gender socialization for femininities)&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg2008&quot;&gt;Steinberg, Laurence D. Adolescence. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the left parietal lobe, which is associated with mathematical and spatial reasoning, is thought to develop up to 4 years earlier in males (which corresponds to masculine socialization in terms of rationality and noted encouragement favoring male students in the physical sciences). This difference could account for the fact that females are sometimes thought to be better when it comes to language and are more emotional (following their gender socialization requirements), while males are thought to be better in math (following their gender socialization requirements). As well, some say that females are better at hearing than males. A typical teenaged female in a society with high levels of gender inequality hears up to 7 times better than a typical teenaged male in the same society. This (along with masculine socialization emphasizing acting out, being loud, and avoiding being controlled) could possibly explain why males are diagnosed with ADHD more often (and may be the result of feminine socialization emphasizing the care-taking of others).&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_237.pdf Diagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disability: United States, 2004–2006]&lt;/ref&gt;. Lastly there is a difference between sight for young females and males. Females are able to see facial expressions / emotions better while males are able to see motion better (mirroring gender socialization emphasis on feminine care-taking and communication and masculine attention to action). Females use the p-cells in the retina, which are associated with texture and color, while males use m-cells, which are associated with motion.

==Social and Psychological Differences==
Gender differences (whether reflected in later physiology or not) typically vary by society, environment, historical context, and/or culture, indicating they are social constructions. For example, in work group situations in the U.S., men tend to focus on the task at hand whereas women tend to focus more on personal relationships&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabriel1999&quot;&gt;Gabriel, S. &amp; Gardner, W.L. (1999). Are there &quot;his&quot; and &quot;hers&quot; types of interdependence?  The implications of gender differences in collective versus relational interdependence for affect, behavior, and cognition.  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, 642-655.&lt;/ref&gt;, but studies of trans people have demonstrated that these differences are often the result of differential treatment women and men receive in the workplace (e.g., transmen report being encouraged to focus more on the task at hand after transition).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumerau2013&quot;/&gt;  When eating, women eating with men tend to eat fewer calories than when they are eating with women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2009&quot;&gt;Young, Meredith E., Madison Mizzau, Nga T. Mai, Abby Sirisegaram, Margo Wilson. 2009. What you eat depends on your sex and eating companions. Appetite. Available online 29 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these differences in behavior vary by culture and are therefore believed to be socially constructed.  Two detailed examples of socially constructed gender differences are presented below: workforce differences and education.

===Work and Occupations===
[[File:Labor force participation rates - 1960-2045.png|right|thumb|300px]]

An often discussed and debated difference between men and women involves work and occupations.  Women's participation in the workforce has varied significantly over time.  Prior to the development of capitalism and factory-type work, women played a significant role in food production and household maintenance.  With the advent of capitalism and labor outside of the home, women continued to play a significant role, though their participation in paid labor outside the home initially diminished.  Also, women's participation in the labor force varied (and varies) depending on marital status and social class.

[[File:Employed civilians by occupation and sex 2013.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]

Current U.S. labor force statistics illustrate women's changing role in the labor force.  For instance, since 1971, women's participation in the labor force has grown from 32 million (43.4% of the female population 16 and over) to 68 million (59.2% of the female population 16 and over).[http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat2.pdf]  Women also make, on average, $17,000 less than do men.[http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf]   Women tend to be concentrated in less prestigious and lower paying occupations&lt;ref name=&quot;Bose1983&quot;&gt;Bose, Christine E. and Peter H. Rossi. (1983). Gender and Jobs: Prestige Standings of Occupations as Affected by Gender. American Sociological Review, Vol. 48, No. 3, pp. 316-330.&lt;/ref&gt; that are traditionally considered ''women's jobs'' (also referred to as ''pink collar'' jobs).[http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf]  Finally, women are not paid the same wages as men for similar work.  This difference is often illustrated as a ratio, as shown in the graph below.  Women tend to make between 75% and 91% of what men make for comparable work, though it depends on how the comparison is made.  For instance, college educated women between 26 and 45 earned 74.7 cents in hourly pay for every dollar men in the same group made in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; However, if you compare women and men with similar profiles and qualifications, the gap is smaller: women make about 91% of what men make, at least they have since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;&gt;Leonhardt, D. (2006). Gender Pay Gap, Once Narrowing, Is Stuck in Place. The New York Times. December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, similarly qualified women made only 82% as much as their male counterparts.

However, at all educational and skill levels, women still make less than men, as illustrated in the figure below.  That women earn less than men with equal qualifications helps explain why women are enrolling in college at higher rates than are men - they require a college education to make the same amount as men with a high school diploma.

[[Image:Ratio of Women's Earnings to Men's by Age 2012.png|thumb|right|300px|Ratio of Women's Earnings to Men's Earnings in 2012.]]

The gap between men's and women's wages narrowed during the 1980s and mid 1990s, but that momentum has fallen off and the distance now appears to have stagnated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; The gap in income between genders used to be similar between middle-class and affluent workers, but it is now widest among the most highly paid.  A woman making in the 95th percentile in 2006 would earn about $95,000 per year; a man in the 95th earning percentile would make about $115,000, a 28% difference (and that's not including the highest earners, who are predominantly men).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;  The narrowing of the gap in pay has also been called into question.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulligan2008&quot;&gt;Mulligan, Casey B., and Yona Rubinstein. 2008. “Selection, Investment, and Women's Relative Wages Over Time*.” Quarterly Journal of Economics 123:1061-1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it appears there has been a narrowing of the gap in pay between men and women, Mulligan and Rubinstein&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulligan2008&quot;/&gt; show that much of the narrowing is actually the result of the most able women entering the workforce and not decreases in the pay gap between men and women.  Thus, even the apparent narrowing of pay between the sexes likely overestimates the actual differences in pay.

It is quite difficult for women to climb to the top in the business world.  For instance, only 3% of tech firms and just 1% of high-tech firms were founded by women and very few are headed by women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadhwa2010&quot;&gt;Wadhwa, Vivek. February 7, 2010. Silicon Valley: You and Some of Your VC's Have a Gender Problem. TechCrunch.com. http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/02/07/silicon-valley-you%E2%80%99ve-got-a-gender-problem-and-some-of-your-vc%E2%80%99s-still-live-in-the-past/ (Accessed: February 7th, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the women who do climb to the top of the organizational ladder in business also experience both overt and covert discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haslam2009&quot;&gt;Haslam, S. Alexander, Michelle K. Ryan, Clara Kulich, Grzegorz Trojanowski, and Cate Atkins. 2009. “Investing with Prejudice: the Relationship Between Women's Presence on Company Boards and Objective and Subjective Measures of Company Performance.” British Journal of Management 9999. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2009.00670.x (Accessed August 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, companies with women on the board of directors have lower stock evaluations than do companies with exclusively male boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haslam2009&quot;/&gt;  This is likely a reflection of the lack of shareholder trust in women.  Women are also often put into leadership positions in corporations when companies are in a crisis and have little hope for recovery, resulting in poorer evaluations of women in leadership positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2005&quot;&gt;Ryan, Michelle K., and S. Alexander Haslam. 2005. “The Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women are Over-Represented in Precarious Leadership Positions.” British Journal of Management 16:81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon of putting women into leadership positions when companies are in trouble is referred to as &quot;the glass cliff&quot; and is also observed in politics, as women are disproportionately chosen to run in elections when it is almost guaranteed that the incumbent male candidate will win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2010&quot;&gt;Ryan, Michelle K., S. Alexander Haslam, and Clara Kulich. 2010. Politics and the Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women are Preferentially Selected to Contest Hard-to-Win Seats. Psychology of Women Quarterly. 34:56-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common explanation for the wage gap between men and women is the finding that women pay a motherhood wage penalty&lt;ref name=&quot;Budig2001&quot;&gt;Budig, M. and England, P. 2001. The Wage Penalty for Motherhood. American Sociological Review. 66:204-25.&lt;/ref&gt;, regardless of whether or not they are actually mothers.  You can think about this from the perspective of a potential employer: If you have two equally qualified candidates for a position, both are in their mid-twenties, married, and straight out of college, but one is a male and the other is female, which would you choose?  Many employers choose men over women because women are &quot;at risk&quot; of having a child, even though they may not want to have children.  And, of course, to the potential employer accommodating a pregnant woman and mother is more cumbersome than a male turned father (despite the obvious need for children to continue our species).  Thus, women pay a penalty for their ability to give birth.  Additionally, when women do have children, this often requires a period of time outside the workforce, whether it's six weeks or several months.  Employers take the time off into account when considering raises.  The &quot;Mommy track&quot; often results in women making less money than equally qualified men who have been in the same job for the same amount of time because women take time off to have children and are often responsible for taking care of children while men rarely do so.  Thus, women are often paid less despite having the same qualifications because they are (1) at risk of having children or (2) do have children and are penalized for doing so.

Another possible explanation for the wage gap between men and women has recently been proposed - customer bias towards white males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hekman2009&quot;&gt;Hekman, David R.; Aquino, Karl; Owens, Brad P.; Mitchell, Terence R.; Schilpzand, Pauline; Leavitt, Keith. 2009. An Examination of Whether and How Racial and Gender Biases Influence Customer Satisfaction. Academy of Management Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hekman et al. (2009) found that customers who viewed videos featuring a black male, a white female, or a white male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the white male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance, despite the fact that all three actors performed identical, read the same script, and were in the exact same location with identical camera angles and lighting.  They provide further evidence to support this claim by noting that white male doctors are rated as more approachable and competent than other doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that employers are willing to pay more for white male employees because employers are customer driven and customers are happier with white male employees.  They also suggest that what is required to solve the problem of wage inequality isn't necessarily paying women more but changing customer biases.  Additional reasons for disparity in pay are discussed below.

Another factor that may contribute to the higher wages of white men is the number of job leads they receive.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonald2009&quot;&gt;McDonald, Steve, Nan Lin, and Dan Ao. 2009. “Networks of Opportunity: Gender, Race, and Job Leads.” Social Problems 56:385.&lt;/ref&gt;  White men, particularly those in management positions, receive more job leads from friends and colleagues than do white women and Hispanic men and women.  Black men and women receive about as many job leads and tips, but only for non-management jobs.  As many jobs result from social networking, white males are advantaged by their higher number of job leads, potentially contributing to their higher salaries and more prestigious jobs.

===Education===
Another often studied difference between men and women is educational attainment.  For a long time, higher education (undergraduate and graduate education) was an exclusively male bastion.  Women did eventually gain access to institutions of higher learning, but parity or equality on a number of levels has still not been achieved.  One measure of educational attainment where women have made great inroads is in college attendance.  In 1960, 37.9% of female high school graduates enrolled in college, compared with 54.0% of male high school graduates.  In 2002, more female high school graduates were enrolling in college than males, 68.4% of females vs. 62.1% males.[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d03/tables/pdf/table186.pdf]  Women have, in fact, made significant progress in this respect.  Women now earn more Bachelors and Masters degrees than do men, and for the first time in 2009, they earned more PhDs.[http://www.cgsnet.org/portals/0/pdf/N_pr_ED2009.pdf] Women have made significant inroads into some of the traditionally most prestigious professions as well: 40% of medical school graduates are women and women make up large percentages of law school students as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

Despite the progress, there are still problems.  While women are entering college at higher rates and even earning more degrees, the degrees are in less prestigious areas (e.g., social sciences and humanities compared to physical sciences) and women with degrees still earn less than do men with comparable degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs1996&quot;&gt;Jacobs, Jerry A. 1996. Gender Inequality and Higher Education. Annual Review of Sociology. 22:153-185.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in medicine, women tend to concentrate in lower paying specialties (e.g., dermatology and family medicine). The highest paid specialties are dominated by men and will be for decades to come, based on the pipeline of residents: 28% of radiology residents in 2004-5 were women, and only 10% of orthopedic surgery residents were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

At the primary and secondary levels, girls don't often do as well as boys, particularly in math and the sciences.  One recent study offers a partial explanation for why this might be the case: highly math-anxious female teachers in elementary school pass their math-anxiety on to the girls in the classroom, but not to the boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beilock2010&quot;&gt;Beilock, S. L., E. A. Gunderson, G. Ramirez, and S. C. Levine. 2010. “Female teachers' math anxiety affects girls' math achievement.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of the class, there were no differences in math anxiety between the boys and girls, but in classes taught by female math-anxious teachers, girls developed math anxiety and boys did not.  This anxiety led girls to believe boys were better at math than girls, though there is no evidence to suggest that is actually the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beilock2010&quot;/&gt;

==Sexism==
'''Sexism''' is [[w:discrimination|discrimination]] against people based on their perceived sex or gender. Sexism can refer to four subtly different beliefs or attitudes:
*The belief that there are only two sexes.
*The belief that one sex is superior to the others.
*The belief that men and women (as well as other genders) are very different and that this should be strongly reflected in society, language, the right to have sex, and the law.
*It can also refer to simple hatred of men ([[w:misandry|misandry]]) or women ([[w:misogyny|misogyny]]) or trans people ([[w: transphobia|transphobia]]).

Many peoples' beliefs on this topic range along a continuum. Some people believe that women should have equal access to all jobs. Others believe that while women are superior to men in a few aspects, in most aspects men are superior to women.  Some believe that cisgender people are normal and better than transgender people while others do not even factor transgender people into their reasoning.

[[Image:Votingwomen.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Women voting in [[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]].]]

Sexist beliefs are an example of [[w:essentialism|essentialist]] thought, which holds that individuals can be understood (and often judged) based on the characteristics of the group to which they belong; in this case, their sex group (male, female, or intersex). Essentialism assumes that all individuals clearly fit into the category of ''male'' or ''female'', which is not the case.  It also assumes characteristics are immutable, which is also not the case.

A good example of sexism against women is a question that has been asked in numerous surveys over the years in the US, &quot;Would you vote for a female candidate for president?&quot;  A 2005 Gallup poll found that 92% of Americans would vote for a female candidate, but follow-up research&lt;ref name=&quot;Streb2008&quot;&gt;Streb, Matthew J., Barbara Burrell, Brian Frederick, and Michael A. Genovese. 2008. “Social Desirability Effects and Support for a Female American President.” Public Opin Q 72:76-89.&lt;/ref&gt; found that this percentage was the result of [[w:response bias|response bias]].  When you use research techniques that allow people to express how they really feel toward women, the actual percentage who would not vote for a female candidate because she is female is closer to 26%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Streb2008&quot;/&gt;  Intriguingly, it is not just men who feel that way, but some women, too.  In short, nearly 1/4 of cisgender Americans maintain sexist attitudes against women (trans people are not counted in the surveys).

Sexism against women is often called ''[[w:chauvinism|chauvinism]]'', though chauvinism is actually a wider term for any extreme and unreasonable partisanship toward a group to which one belongs, especially when the partisanship includes malice and hatred towards a rival group. Many forms of [[w:radical feminism|radical feminism]] and [[w: Cisgender|cissexism]] can legitimately be referred to as ''chauvinism''. This is not common usage, however, and the term is most often used to refer to [[w:male chauvinism|male chauvinism]]. 

While the view that women are superior to men is also sexism, only in recent years has an awareness of this ''[[w:reverse sexism|reverse sexism]]'' begun to develop in public discourse. Certain forms of sexual discrimination are illegal in many countries, but nearly all countries have laws that give special rights, privileges, or responsibilities to one sex.

Recent research illustrates the pervasiveness of sexism in the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messner2006&quot;&gt;Messner, M.A., Duncan, M.C., &amp; Willms, N. (2006). This Revolution Is Not Being Televised. Contexts: Understanding People in their Social Worlds, 5(3), 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Messner et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messner2006&quot;/&gt; found that sports coverage on major television networks focuses predominantly on men, despite the increase in female participation in sports since the passage of [[w:Title IX|Title IX]] in 1972. In 1971, 294,000 high school girls played interscholastic sports, compared to 3.7 million boys.  By 1989 that ratio changed substantially - 1.8 million girls played sports compared to 3.4 million boys. By 2004 the ratio had changed even more - 2.9 million girls compared to 4.0 million boys.  At the collegiate level, the change was also substantial. In 1972, the average college in the U.S. had two women's sports teams.  In just the four years between 2000 and 2004, universities in the U.S. added 631 new women's teams.

Despite the increase in participation in sports, major network news coverage of women's sports has changed very little over the last 15 years.  In 1989 women garnered only 5% of air time; in 1999 that increased to 9%, but it fell back to 6% by 2005.  Sports highlights shows (e.g., ESPNS's [[w:sportscenter|SportsCenter]]) are even less accommodating, giving only 2% to 3% of air time to women.  What's more, the little amount of air time given to women often portrays women's sports as &quot;novelties&quot; or pseudo-sports and often includes gags, like the women's nude [[w:bungee|bungee]] jump in 1999. Additionally, much of the coverage of women in sports is sexualized, as attention is often only given to women deemed &quot;attractive&quot; by the news anchors (e.g., [[w:Anna Kournikova|Anna Kournikova]] and [[w:Maria Sharapova|Maria Sharapova]]). Whether this treatment of women in sport is intentional or not, it is a clear example of sexism in the media.

[[Image:Oprah Winfrey (2004).jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[w:Oprah Winfrey|Oprah Winfrey]] is one of the wealthiest women in the world, an exception to the findings of Tickamyer.]]

Another example of gender discrimination is the disparity in wealth between men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tickamyer1981&quot;&gt;Tickamyer, Ann R. 1981. Wealth and Power: A Comparison of Men and Women in the Property Elite. Social Forces. 60(2):463-481.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using biographical data published in magazines and books as well as IRS income reports, Tickamyer found:
*there are fewer wealthy women than there are wealthy men
*it is not entirely clear as to whether sources of wealth differ, but it does appear that women are more likely than men to inherit their wealth (especially from husbands)
*the forms of women's holdings differ from men's; many women have their money in trusts, which is a safer form of investment than those used by men (e.g., stocks and bonds)
*women are less likely to have control over their wealth than men and are less likely to be actively engaged in increasing their wealth through investments as, say, the head of a company is engaged in growing his wealth

The author attributed the differences in wealth distribution to historical instances of gender discrimination.  Up until the 19th Century most women could not own property and women's participation in the paid labor force outside the home was limited. It is possible that wealth among the elite may be redistributed toward a more equal balance between the sexes with increasing numbers of women entering the workforce and moving toward more financially lucrative positions in major corporations.

The differences in income between men and women mentioned above are partially due to discrimination, but also due, in part, to some women (including highly educated women) choosing to leave the labor force and stay home with their young children.  Leaving the labor force doubly impacts income: (1) It takes away immediate income, and (2) reduces experience and tenure, lowering future earning potential. Additionally, while women have made significant inroads into many highly paid fields (e.g., medicine, law), the influx of women into those fields has slowed since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; Reflecting sexism in US culture is a recent finding that when women are successful their male partners feel threatened, whereas women feel better about their relationships when their male partners succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratliff2013&quot;&gt;Ratliff, Kate A., and Shigehiro Oishi. 2013. “Gender Differences in Implicit Self-Esteem Following a Romantic Partner’s Success or Failure.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 105(4):688–702.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some organizations are suing their employers claiming gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt; For instance, [[w:Wal-Mart |Wal-Mart]] has faced lawsuits by  female employees who alleged gender discrimination.  Part of the plaintiffs' argument rests on the fact that, while roughly 75% of intra-store department heads are women, only 20% of store managers (who make close to $100,000 per year) are women. It is difficult to prove discrimination in such cases.  In fact, many researchers point out that there may and probably are other root causes, including: differences in gender socialization (men believe they need to support their families as the primary breadwinners, leading to greater job commitment) and emphasis by the government on equality in pay and opportunity between genders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leonhardt2006&quot;/&gt;

===Violence===
Sexism can take many forms, including preventing women from attending college and paying women less than men for comparable work.  Another common form of sexism is violence, especially violence toward women and trans people. In 2002, women were the victims of over 900,000 violent crimes and over 200,000 rapes or sexual assaults.[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cvus02.pdf]   Men are more likely to be the victims of violent crime, but far less likely to be the victims of rapes or sexual assaults.  Similarly, recent reports show steady patterns wherein trans people suffer more gender related violence than any other social group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumerau2013&quot;/&gt;

==Theories of Gender Differences==
===Gender Socialization===
Sociologists and other social scientists generally attribute many of the differences between genders to socialization (note that even physiological differences mirror existing gender socialization processes).  [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|As discussed in the chapter on socialization]], socialization is the process of transferring norms, values, beliefs, and behaviors to future group members.  In gender socialization, the groups people join are the gender categories, &quot;cisgender women and men&quot; and &quot;transgender people&quot;.  Thus, gender socialization is the process of educating and instructing potential males, females, and intersex children as to the norms, behaviors, values, and beliefs of group membership.

Preparations for gender socialization begin even before the birth of the child.  One of the first questions people ask of expectant parents is the ''sex'' of the child.  This is the beginning of a social categorization process that continues throughout life.  Preparations for the birth often take the infant's perceived sex into consideration (e.g., painting the room blue if the child is a boy, pink for a girl).  Many of the gender differences just described are attributed to differences in socialization, though it is possible that as yet undemonstrated genetic and biological factors play some role.  It is important to keep in mind that gender differences are a combination of social and biological forces; sometimes one or the other has a larger influence, but both play a role in dictating behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dobash1979&quot;&gt;Dobash, R. Emerson, and Russell Dobash. 1979. Violence Against Wives. Macmillan USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  

One illustration of early life gender socialization can be seen in preschool classrooms.  Children in preschool classrooms where teachers were told to emphasize gender differences saw an increase in stereotyped views of what activities are appropriate for boys and girls, while children with teachers who did not emphasize gender showed no increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilliard2010&quot;&gt;Hilliard, Lacey J., and Lynn S. Liben. 2010. “Differing Levels of Gender Salience in Preschool Classrooms: Effects on Children’s Gender Attitudes and Intergroup Bias.” Child Development 81:1787-1798.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study supports the idea that subtle cues that surround us in our everyday lives strongly influence gender socialization.

Research&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg1983&quot;&gt;Greenberg, Ellen and Steinberg, Laurence D. 1983. Sex Differences in Early Labor Force Experience: Harbinger of Things to Come. Social Forces. 62(2):467-486.&lt;/ref&gt; finds that gender differences in work and occupations begin with adolescents' first jobs:
*first jobs are significantly segregated by sex
*girls work fewer hours per week than boys
*girls earn less per hour than boys
*hourly wages are higher in job types dominated by males
*girls are assigned more housework than are boys&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerson2001&quot;&gt;Gerson, Kathleen. “Children of the Gender Revolution: Some Theoretical Questions and Findings from the Field.” Pp. 446-461 in Restructuring Work and the Life Course, edited by Victor W. Marshall, Walter R. Heinz, Helga Krueger, and Anil Verma. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers attribute these differences to gender socialization and differential opportunities for boys and girls.

Another example of research finding differences in behavior between genders can be seen in the differences in self-ratings of attractiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rand1983&quot;&gt;Rand, Cynthia S. and Hall, Judith A. 1983. Sex Differences in the Accuracy of Self-Perceived Attractiveness. Social Psychology Quarterly. 46(4):359-363.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using fifty-five Johns Hopkins University undergraduates (24 females), the authors had the students fill out questionnaires they designed as self-appraisals of attractiveness. The authors then used a panel to rate the attractiveness of the participants (an objective measure).  The researchers found that females are fairly accurate in their assessments of their attractiveness but males are not.  They explained their findings by discussing the salience of attractiveness for females, a characteristic learned through socialization: Attractiveness is a more important component of femininities.  This is seen in the disparity between females and males in the number of cosmetic surgeries they undergo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2007&quot;&gt;Carr, Deborah. 2007. “Body Work.” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:58.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 11.5 million cosmetic surgeries performed in 2005, women accounted for 85% to 90% of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2007&quot;/&gt; Because attractiveness is so important for females, they are more attuned to their actual attractiveness than are males.

===Structural Functionalism===
In this perspective, which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parsons1964&quot;&gt;Parsons, Talcott. 1964. Social System. Free Press. ISBN 0029241901&lt;/ref&gt; genders are viewed as complementary - women take care of the home while men provide for the family.  Much current research, especially after the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, criticizes this approach for supporting the status quo and condoning the oppression of women.  In fact, this approach - in combination with Evolutionary Psychological and Sociobiological perspectives on sex / gender has thus far only found empirical validation when gender inequalities are assumed to be natural and/or appropriate conditions, and only received legitimacy within anti-feminist social movements, religious organizations, and scientific communities promoting the &quot;male/female&quot; or &quot;XX/XY&quot; mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler1999&quot;/&gt;

===Conflict Theory===
In contrast to the status quo supporting structural functionalist approach, social conflict theory argues that gender is best understood in terms of power relationships.  Men's dominance of women and cisgender dominance of transgender is seen as an attempt to maintain power and privilege to the detriment of women.  This approach is normative in that it prescribes changes to the power structure, advocating a balance of power between genders. 

===Symbolic Interaction===
Extending Conflict perspectives, Symbolic Interaction theories examine the varied meanings and constructions of gender over time and space.  In so doing, Symbolic Interaction researchers have demonstrated the shifting &quot;biological beliefs&quot; about gender in relation to women's movement activities as well as the processes whereby gender socialization occurs.  This approach seeks to excavate the origins of gender beliefs and patterns while paying specific attention to the ways these meanings change in relation to shifting power dynamics and social norms.  

===Feminist Theory===
Blending aspects of Conflict and Symbolic Interaction theories, Feminist Theory critiques hierarchical power relations embedded within existing gender structures, cultures, beliefs, discourses, identities, and processes of self presentation.  Drawing on Conflict Theories, for example, Feminist Theory examines how women and other gender minorities are disadvantaged in relation to men and cisgender norms within [[w: patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures, cultures, and processes of social organization.  Similarly, Feminist Theory draws on Symbolic Interactionist conceptions of the self and groups to ascertain how people learn to present, signify, interpret, and believe in notions of womanhood and/or manhood as well as the ways these processes generate, challenge, maintain, and/or reproduce social inequalities.  Central to these efforts, Feminist Theories typically examine past and present gender relations shaped by [[w:patriarchy|patriarchy]] and [[w:intersectionality|intersectionality]].  

====Patriarchy====
Feminist Theory defines patriarchy as a social system that is (1) male dominated (e.g., the primary positions of power are occupied by and/or encouraged for males rather than others), (2) male identified (e.g., what is defined as valuable or normative in society is associated with men and masculinities), and (3) male centered (e.g., the cultural focus of attention, whether media, scientific, religious, or political based, is on men and the things men do).  This does not mean that all men in a patriarchal society will be or feel powerful throughout their lives or necessarily possess power over women and trans people.  Rather, it means that the primary social focus in a given social context favors males and those perceived to be men while granting all men - regardless of their intentions or their recognition of this fact - unearned privileges within and between existing social institutions.  

====Intersectionality====
Feminist Theory - drawing heavily on the historical and contemporary work of Black Feminist Thought - defines intersectionality as the interrelation and intersection of multiple, interlocking systems of oppression and privilege within and between societies.  Central to this perspective is the recognition that systems of inequality, such as race, class, gender, sexuality, and age, ultimately rely upon and reproduce one another at all levels of society.  As a result, social justice requires an examination of the foundations and interconnections that make existing and past inequalities possible as well as the ways these system influence the contemporary and future developments of social, political, scientific, religious, and cultural systems of knowledge and power.

==Research Examples==
A powerful example of how gender affects every day life comes from the recently published research of Kristen Schilt on female-to-male (FTM) transexuals in the workplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schilt2006&quot;&gt;Schilt, Kristen. &quot;Just One of the Guys?: How Transmen Make Gender Visible in the Workplace.&quot; Gender &amp; Society. 20 (4) 2006, 465-490.&lt;/ref&gt; Schilt interviewed FTM transsexuals after they had undergone their sex changes and found that, following their change to a male identity, two-thirds of the FTM transsexuals saw increased benefits in the workplace, including receiving greater rewards for doing less work.  They were also treated differently.  They found that their opinions had greater authority and received more recognition for their work. The FTMs who did not experience these benefits tended to be smaller and minorities. In short, white males are privileged in the workplace, even when those &quot;white males&quot; were formerly white females.  The lesson: Perceived gender has a powerful influence on every day social interaction.

Another interesting example of gender's influence on social organization comes from the recently published research of J. Edward Sumerau on gay Christian men's attempts to construct masculine selves within the context of a gay-friendly religious organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumerau2012&quot;&gt;Sumerau, J. Edward.  2012.  ““That’s what men are supposed to do”:  Compensatory Manhood Acts in an LGBT Christian Church.”  Gender &amp; Society 26: 461-487.&lt;/ref&gt; Sumerau spent over 3 years observing the ways gay Christian males signified themselves as men, and sought to claim privileges typically associated with masculinity.  Ze found that the gay Christian males drew upon existing notions of masculinity, such as beliefs that men are breadwinners and leaders, emotionally controlled and rational, and dominants within relationships.  This was done to demonstrate their &quot;masculine&quot; selves to one another and convince themselves of their &quot;rightful&quot; place as church and community leaders.  The lesson:  Masculinities may be constructed via the use of everyday assumptions and beliefs built into the gender norms of a given society.

| Over a cup of coffee, Jordan said, “I’m often amazed by the ways child-bound (i.e., people who have or want children) react when they come into contact with child-free people” (i.e., people who do not have or want children).  Sipping my coffee, I nodded and asked, “What happened this time?”  Laughing, Jordan said, “Oh, you know, the usual – some old dude told me ‘well you never know one day you might change your mind.”  Giggling, I said, “That’s my favorite, I love turning to them and saying ‘you might want to keep a weapon handy since some day you might change your mind and want to get rid of junior quickly.”  Laughing and spilling coffee, Jordan added, “No, my favorite is the old ‘why do you hate children’ and then I get to point out to them that I’m not the one seeking to control children like prisoners through bedtimes, punishments, and other arbitrary rules.”  

Arriving at the table with a latte, Addison asked, “What’s so funny you two,” and I replied, “Jordan ran into another child-bound zealot” (i.e., child-bound people who feel everyone should want or have children).  Sitting down, Addison said, “Oh great, was it the one where you ‘must be anti-family’ if you don’t want to clean up someone else’s shit and spend your money on someone else’s room and board because you know you can’t support the decisions of others when they’re not the same as yours?”  As Jordan and I nodded, Addison frowned and said, “You know, zealots sometimes make me wish I’d never had kids just so I wouldn’t have to associate with them.  I love my babies, but I never knew being child-bound turned so many people into assholes.”  Smiling, Jordan said, “I’m actually glad you had kids because you give me hope that people can be both child-bound and decent to others at the same time.”  Nodding, I added, “Jordan’s right, sometimes thinking of child-bound folks like you is the only way not to kill the zealots on the spot.  Now, as fun as this is, can we get to planning your baby’s birthday party already – I brought glitter for the whole family!”

==Introduction==
[[Image:Family67.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A large family from the U.S., circa 1984.]]

Most people have a network of others they consider their family.  But what exactly is a family?  How do family structures vary from culture to culture or subculture to subculture?  Is what we consider the traditional family changing over time?  Why do families exist?  These are the questions sociologists ask when discussing families.

==Defining Families==
You may think this is a fairly straightforward question with a simple answer.  But think about it for a minute then ask yourself, &quot;Who and what do I include in my family?&quot; You might say your parents, your siblings, and/or your spouse.  But what if you have none of these relations?  And what about the family pet?  What if you were raised by your grandparents and your parents played little to no role in your life or if you grew up in an orphanage or the foster care system?  Who, then, do you consider your family?  Is family limited to genetically related individuals; those we typically think of as kin, and if so, does this mean some people have never met their own family if they have one at all?  Also, if families are limited to genetically related individuals, what do we make of adopted, fostered, or artificially developed people - do they have a family, multiple families, or some combination there in?

Questioning the basic concept of family is a relatively new phenomenon, though variations in what we consider a &quot;family&quot; are not.  There are so many variations of &quot;family&quot; today that it is hard to define what, exactly, a family is.  Generally, we think of a '''family''' as a domestic [[w:group (sociology)|group]] of people, or a number of domestic groups linked through descent from: (1) a common ancestor, (2) marriage, (3) adoption, or (4) some other committed (romantic or otherwise) relationship. While many families have some form of kinship, many others possess no such tie.

But society increasingly accepts a number of variations on family forms. Consider each of the following examples:
*an elderly man and his twelve cats
*a cohabiting gay, lesbian, or asexual couple with three foster children
*a mixed group of singles sharing a town home in a large city
*a close knit fraternity or sorority
*a small group of soldiers fighting in a foreign country
*a collection of orphans or runaways sharing a residence

Each of the above groups differs from the dominant form of family in contemporary American society: a man, a woman, and their children.  This notion of parents and children as family is called a ''[[w:nuclear family|nuclear family]]'' and is a recent invention of the Western World that has (in some cases) been sold as a form of &quot;tradition.&quot;  It is a social construct that does not necessarily reflect the reality of family life for many people.  In fact, with recent developments in the U.S., the nuclear family is no longer the primary form of social life in the U.S. According to recent census data, more adult women now live alone or are raising their children alone than are living with a spouse or raising their children with a spouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2006&quot;/&gt; Further, historical research suggests the nuclear family has never been the statistical or numeric norm in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz1992&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 1992.  The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2005&quot;&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill.  2005.  Black Sexual Politics:  African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism.  Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; What many people consider a family is not the only family form; families are diverse in both form and function.

===Cultural Variations===
[[Image:Polygamy world map.png|thumb|300px|right|A map of the world regions where polygamy is a common form of family structure.]]

The structure of families traditionally hinges on relations between parents and children, between spouses, between members of long term relationships (romantic, economic or otherwise) or all of the above. Consequently, there is substantial variation in family forms around the world, varying from culture to culture. The most common form of romantic relationship tied to family structure in the Western World is monogamy, which is the practice of having only one spouse or committed romantic partner at a time. A variety of other family structures exist.  One prevalent form is polygamy, which broadly refers to any form of marriage in which a person has more than one spouse. Historically, polygamy has been practiced as polygyny (one man having more than one wife), as polyandry (one woman having more than one husband), or, less commonly, as &quot;polygamy&quot; (having many wives and many husbands at one time). Further, many people practice [[w: polyamory|polyamory]], which refers to the acceptance, desire, and experience of more than one intimate relationship at a time with the consent of all involved (note this differs from polygamy, which refers to multiple spouses rather than relationships and which historically, religiously, and culturally does not necessarily require the consent of all parties involved).  

Another factor that leads to cultural variations in relationships tied to family forms is attitudes toward endogamy. Endogamy is the practice of marrying, becoming romantically involved, or engaging in sexual relations within a social group. Cultures that practice endogamy require relationships between specified social groups, classes, or ethnicities. Many people tend to develop relationships with members of their own social group, but there are some societies that practice endogamy very strictly and as part of their moral values, traditions, or religious beliefs. An example of a strictly endogamous religious group is the Yazidi in Northern Iraq, who prohibit any inter-clan marrying. Endogamy is a common practice among displaced cultures attempting to make roots in new countries as it encourages group solidarity and ensures greater control over group resources (which may be important to preserve where a group is attempting to establish itself within an alien culture).

===Changes Over Time===
Family structures of some kind are found in every society. Pairing off into formal or informal relationships (often referred to as marriages) originated in hunter-gatherer groups to forge networks of cooperation beyond the immediate family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2006. Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage. Penguin. ISBN: 014303667X&lt;/ref&gt;  Intermarriage between groups, tribes, or clans was often political or strategic and resulted in reciprocal obligations between the two groups represented by the marital partners.  Even so, marital dissolution was not a serious problem as the obligations resting on marital longevity were not particularly high.

The development of horticultural or agriculture-based societies fundamentally changed the nature of marriage and family forms built around it.  With the advent of sedentary societies, marriage became one of the central institutions for forging economic and political relationships and was no longer viewed, at least among the aristocracy, as a relationship that should be based on love, companionship, or sexual attraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;/&gt; Among the aristocratic elite, marriage became a means of developing alliances or amassing wealth.  For the non-elites, marriage was a pragmatic way of supporting oneself: it was easier to survive if resources (i.e., food, labor power, childcare responsibilities, etc.) were pooled between several people.

You can see a good example of the changing nature of families in the family structure of Ancient Rome. In Ancient Rome the family structure was centered on the father (see ''[[w:paterfamilias|paterfamilias]]''). In this structure, fathers held great power (''patria potestas'') over those living with them: They could force marriage and divorce, sell children into slavery, claim dependents' property as their own, and possibly even claim the right to kill family members. ''Patria potestas'' extended over adult sons with their own households: A man was not considered a ''paterfamilias'' while his own father lived. A daughter, when she married, usually fell under the authority of the ''paterfamilias'' of her husband's household, although this was not always the case, as she could choose to continue recognizing her father's family as her true family. However, as Romans reckoned descent through the male line, any children she had would belong to her husband's family. Groups of related households formed a family. Families were based on blood ties (or adoption), but were also used for political and economic alliances. Ancient Roman marriage was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association, especially in the upper classes. 

Modern forms of family structure and marriage in the West have their roots in Christian philosophy and practice.  The [[w:nuclear family|nuclear family]] emerged during the late medieval period&lt;ref name=&quot;Greif2005&quot;&gt;Greif, Avner. 2005. Family Structure, Institutions, and Growth: The Origin and Implications of Western Corporatis http://www.aeaweb.org/annual_mtg_papers/2006/0106_0800_1104.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was formalized during the Council of Trent, in which marriage was defined as, 
&quot;The conjugal union of man and woman, contracted between two qualified persons, which obliges them to live together throughout life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte1997&quot;/&gt;  While a variety of family structures continue to exist around the world today, including polygamous and polygynous families in many societies (including the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olaiz2006&quot;&gt;Olaiz, H. (2006). Warren Jeffs and the Mormon Art of Forgetting. Sunstone(142), 68-70.&lt;/ref&gt;), the predominant form is built upon monogamous sexual and emotional relations (though, as noted above, this is no longer the majority form). As described below and shown in the figure below, variations on monogamous relationships are increasingly prevalent (i.e., same-sex marriage), as are alternatives to monogamy (e.g., single-parent households and polyamory).

==Families and Theory==
===The Function of Families===
The primary function of the procreative families (e.g., families built around the pursuit of parenthood) is to reproduce society, biologically through procreation, socially through socialization, or in both ways. Given these functions, one's experience of one's family shifts over time. From the perspective of children, the family is a '''family of orientation''': the family functions to locate children socially, and plays a major role in their socialization. From the point of view of the parent(s), the family is a '''family of procreation''': the family functions to produce and socialize children. In some cultures marriage imposes upon women the ''obligation'' to bear children. In northern Ghana, for example, payment of [[w:bridewealth|bridewealth]] signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face substantial threats of physical abuse and reprisals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bawah1999 &quot;&gt;Bawah, A.A.; Akweongo, P.; Simmons, R.; and Phillips, J.F. 1999. Women's Fears and Men's Anxieties: The Impact of Family Planning on Gender Relations in Northern Ghana.  Studies in Family Planning. 30:1, 54-66. http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, procreative families utilize marital privileges, rights, and laws (if they have access to these opportunities legally) to establish legal parenthood of a child, gain control over sexual services, labor, and / or property, establish a joint fund of property for the benefit of children, and / or establish relations between partner's larger familial networks.  No society does all of these; no one of these is universal, and many people different societies lack access to whatever marital and family privileges available in their given social context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohannan1968&quot;&gt;Bohannan, Paul and Middleton, Jon. 1968. Marriage, Family, and Residence. Natural History Press. ASIN: B006D7FBI&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Powell et al. 2010.  Counted Out: Same-Sex Relations and Americans’ Definitions of Family.  Russell Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;In societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between a marital members, increasing economic opportunities and decreasing tax burdens, which can aid the establishment of financially stable families. In modern societies marriage entails particular rights and privileges - for those allowed to marry - that encourage the formation of new families even when there is no intention of having children.

The primary functions of non-procreative families (e.g., families that are built around pursuits and desires that do not involve parenthood) is to facilitate social, economic, emotional, and interpersonal support networks, combine resources for the pursuit of financial gain and / or stability, formalize long term commitments to one another and to larger familial and social networks, claim some of the rights, benefits and privileges granted to procreative families in many countries, and / or adhere to religious / spiritual beliefs about emotional-sexual commitment, trajectory, and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Mary and Verta Taylor.  2013.  The Marrying Kind? Debating Same-Sex Marriage within the Lesbian and Gay Movement.  University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sociobiology of Families===
In almost all societies, marriage between brothers and sisters is forbidden, with Ancient Egyptian, Hawaiian, and Inca royalty being the rare exceptions. In many societies, marriage between some first cousins is preferred, while at the other extreme, the medieval Catholic church prohibited marriage even between distant cousins. The present day Catholic Church still maintains a standard of required distance (in both consanguinity and affinity) for marriage.

These sorts of restrictions are a form of [[w:exogamy|exogamy]]. One exception to this pattern is in ancient Egypt, where marriage [[w:incest|between brothers and sisters]] was permitted in the royal family — as it was also permitted in Hawaii and among the Inca. This privilege was denied commoners and may have served to concentrate wealth and power in one family. The consequence of the incest-taboo is exogamy, the requirement to marry someone from another group. The incest taboo may serve to promote social solidarity.

==The Family Life Cycle==
===Courtship===
[[Image:Youth and suitors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Youth conversing with suitors''&lt;br&gt;from the ''Haft Awrang'' of [[Jami]], in the story ''A Father Advises his Son About Love.'']]

'''Courtship''' is the traditional dating period before engagement and marriage (or long term commitment if marriage is not allowed).  It is an alternative to [[w:arranged marriage|arranged marriage]]s in which the couple or group doesn't meet before the wedding. During a courtship, a couple or group gets to know each other and decides if there will be an engagement. Courting includes activities such as dating where couples or groups go together for some activity (e.g., a meal or movie). Courting can also take place without personal contact, especially with modern technology.  [[w:Virtual dating|Virtual dating]], chatting on-line, sending text messages, conversing over the telephone, instant messaging, writing [[w:Letter (message)|letters]], and sending gifts are all modern forms of courting.

Courtship varies both by time period and by region of the world.  One way courtship varies is in the duration; courting can take days or years. In the United Kingdom, a poll of 3,000&lt;ref name=mc&gt; [http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/181134/average-man-proposes-after-three-years.html marieclaire.co.uk &gt; News &gt; World News &gt; Average man proposes after three years] Monday 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; engaged or married couples suggested an average duration between first meeting and engagement of 2 years and 11 months,&lt;ref name=mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=metro&gt; [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=99603&amp;in_page_id=8 Average man takes 3 years to propose] Metrosexual, Sunday, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:44-aspetti di vita quotidiana, stagione calda,Taccuino Sanit.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Courting, [[Tacuinum Sanitatis]] (XIV century)]]

While the date is fairly casual in most European-influenced cultures, in some traditional societies, courtship is a highly structured activity, with very specific formal rules. In some societies, the parents or community propose potential partners, and then allow limited dating to determine whether the parties are suited (in fact, this was common in the U.S. throughout the 1800's). In Japan, some parents hire a matchmaker to provide pictures and résumés of potential mates, and if the couple or group agrees, there will be a formal meeting with the matchmaker and often parents in attendance; this is called [[w:Miai|Omiai]]. In more closed societies, courtship is virtually eliminated altogether by the practice of arranged marriages, where partners are chosen for young people, typically by their parents or (in the absence of parents) local authorities.  Forbidding experimental and serial courtship and sanctioning only arranged matches is partly a means of guarding the chastity of young people and partly a matter of furthering family interests, which in such cultures may be considered more important than individual romantic preferences.  Another variation of courtship is the [[w:Bundling (tradition)|bundling tradition]], which likely originated in Scandinavia and was carried to the U.S. by immigrants.  Bundling involved potential mates spending the night together in the same bed, though the couple was not supposed to engage in sexual relations.  This practice ceased in the late 19th Century.
 
In earlier centuries, young adults were expected to court with the intention of finding marriage partners, rather than for social reasons. However, by the 1920s, dating for fun was becoming an expectation, and by the 1930s, it was assumed that any popular young person would have lots of dates. This form of dating, though, was usually more chaste than is seen today, since pre-marital sex was not considered the norm even though it was widespread. As a result of social changes spurred by the [[w:sexual revolution|sexual revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the taboo of sex during dating began to wane. Couples today are more likely to &quot;hook up&quot; or &quot;hang out&quot; with large groups rather than go on old-fashioned, paired dates. In recent years, a number of college newspapers have featured editorials where students decry the lack of &quot;dating&quot; on their campuses. This may be a result of a highly-publicized 2001 study and campaign sponsored by the conservative American women's group [[w:Independent Women's Forum|Independent Women's Forum]], which promotes &quot;traditional&quot; dating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwf.org/campuscorner/hookingup.asp Hooking Up, Hanging Out, and Hoping for Mr. Right: College Women on Dating and Mating Today] (Retrieved 18:35, [[12 January]] [[2007]])&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in recent years dating has evolved and taken on the metamorphic properties necessary to sustain itself in today's world.  This can be seen in the rise in internet dating, speed dating or gradual exclusivity dating (a.k.a. slow dating). Some theorize that courtship as it was known to prior generations has seen its last days and the next closest thing is gradual exclusivity, where the partners respect and value each other's individual lives but still maintain the ultimate goal of being together even if time or space does not permit it now.

Courtship is used by a number of theorists to explain gendering processes and sexual identity.  Despite occasional studies as early as the 1910's, systematic scientific research into courtship began in the 1980s after which time academic researchers started to generate theories about modern dating practices and norms.  Both Moore and Perper argued that, contrary to popular beliefs, courtship is normally triggered and controlled by women&lt;ref name=&quot;Perper1985&quot;&gt;Perper, T. (1985) ''Sex Signals: The Biology Of Love'', Philadelphia, ISI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, N. (1985) “Nonverbal courtship patterns in women: contact and consequences”, ''Ethology and Sociobiology'', 6: 237-247.&lt;/ref&gt;, driven mainly by non-verbal behaviors to which men respond. This is generally supported by other theorists who specialize in the study of body language&lt;ref name=&quot;Pease2004&quot;&gt;Pease, A. and Pease, B. (2004) ''The Definitive Book Of Body Language'', London: Orion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;, but ignores the ways females are socialized to &quot;gain status&quot; by learning to appear attractive to and demonstrate desire for males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orenstein2012&quot;&gt;Orenstein, Peggy.  2012.

Gender Play: Girls and Boys in School (Studies of Great Texts in Science).  Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist scholars, however, continue to regard courtship as a socially constructed (and male-focused) process organised to subjugate women&lt;ref name=&quot;Hearn1987&quot;&gt;Hearn, J. &amp; Parkin, W. (1987) ''Sex at work: The power and paradox of organisation sexuality'', Brighton: Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell1995&quot;&gt;Connell, R. W (1995) ''Gender and Power'', Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  While some criticize Feminist interpretations of courtship by pointing to women's support of courtship and attraction to magazines about marital and romantic experience,&lt;ref name=&quot;Farrell2000&quot;&gt;Farrell, W. (2000) ''Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say'', New York: Tarcher/Putnam.&lt;/ref&gt; such criticisms generally ignore the emphasis on marital and romantic relationships (in many cases as the sole element of women's value in male-dominated societies) embedded within feminine socialization norms,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogle2008&quot;&gt;Kathleen A.

===Marriage===
'''Marriage''' is a governmentally, socially, or religiously recognized interpersonal relationship, usually intimate and sexual, that is often created as a form of contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;Elmer&quot; Social Science Dictionary http://www.elissetche.org/dico/M.htm &quot;&gt;&quot;Elmer&quot; Social Science Dictionary http://www.elissetche.org/dico/M.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequently occurring form of marriage is between a woman and a man, where the feminine term ''wife'' and the masculine ''husband'' are generally used to describe the parties to the contract. Other forms of marriage also exist. For example, polygamy, in which a person takes more than one spouse, is present in many societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murdoch1949&quot;&gt;Murdoch, George Peter. 1949. Social Structure. The MacMillan Company: New York. ISBN  0-02-922290-7.&lt;/ref&gt; (See, for instance, the [[w:Kaingang|Kaingang]], of Brazil, where close to 40% of the marriages were not monogamous but included multiple spousal partners.) Currently, the legal concept of marriage is expanding to include [[w:same-sex marriage|same-sex marriage]] in some areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arce2004&quot;&gt;Arce, Rose.

[[Image:Bride and groom signing the book.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A bride and groom at their wedding.]]

The [[w:ceremony|ceremony]] in which a marriage is enacted and announced to the community is called a wedding. The ways in which marriages are enacted have changed over time. In Europe during the [[w:Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], marriage was enacted by the couple promising verbally that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or other witnesses was not required. This promise was known as the &quot;verbum&quot;. If made in the present tense (e.g. &quot;I marry you&quot;), it was unquestionably binding; if made in the future tense (&quot;I will marry you&quot;), it would, by itself constitute a [[w:betrothal|betrothal]]. If the couple proceeded to have sexual relations, the union was a marriage. As part of the [[w:Reformation|Reformation]], the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state; by the 1600s many of the [[w:Protestantism|Protestant]] European countries had heavy state involvement in marriage. As part of the [[w:Counter-Reformation|Counter-Reformation]], the [[w:Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] added a [[w:Clandestinity (in Canon Law)|requirement]] of witnesses to the promise, which under normal circumstances had to include the priest.

[[File:Marriage and Divorce Rates 1960-2011.png|right|thumb|300px]]

The reasons people marry vary widely, but usually include: to publicly and formally declare their [[w:love|love]], the formation of a single household unit, legitimizing sexual relations and [[w:procreation|procreation]], social and economic stability, and the education and nurturing of children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krier2006&quot;&gt;Krier, James E., Alexander, Gregory S., Schill, Michael H., and Dukeminier, Jesse. 2006. Property. Aspen Publishers. ISBN 0735557926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher2002&quot;&gt;Gallagher, Maggie. 2002. What is Marriage For? The Public Purposes of Marriage Law. Louisiana Law Review. http://www.marriagedebate.com/pdf/What%20is%20Marriage%20For.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A marriage can be declared by a wedding ceremony, which may be performed either by a religious officiator or through a similar government-sanctioned secular process. The act of marriage creates obligations between the individuals involved, and, in some societies, between the parties' extended families. Marriages are perpetual agreements with legal consequences, terminated only by the death of one party or by formal dissolution processes, such as divorce and annulment.

Schwartz and Mare&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2005&quot;&gt;Schwartz, Christine R. and Mare, Robert D. 2005. Trends in Educational Assortative Marriage From 1940 to 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; examined trends in marriage over time and found that the old maxim, &quot;opposites attract&quot; is less accurate of marriage than the maxim &quot;birds of a feather flock together.&quot;  Their research focused on one specific similarity in marital partners: education.  They found that the educational levels of American married couples decreased in similarity slightly after World War II but has since increased substantially.  As of 2003, one's level of educational attainment was a significant predictor of the educational attainment of one's spouse. People without a high school diploma are unlikely to marry someone with more educational attainment, and people with a college degree are likely to marry people with a similar level of educational attainment. Part of the reason why education is so influential in determining the level of education of one's spouse is because people tend to form groups based on levels of education.  First there are the groups formed in the process of becoming educated (many people meet their spouses in school). But jobs after one completes his/her education also tend to be grouped by level of education. As a result, people spend more time with individuals of a similar level of educational attainment.  As most people tend to marry or partner with individuals with whom they spend a lot of time, it is not surprising that there is significant educational similarity between spouses.

One well-known attribute of marriage is that it tends to have health benefits.  Happily married people tend to be healthier than unmarried people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt-Lunstad2008&quot;&gt;Holt-Lunstad, Julianne, Birmingham, Wendy, and Jones, Brandon Q. 2008. Is There Something Unique about Marriage? The Relative Impact of Marital Status, Relationship Quality, and Network Social Support on Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Mental Health. Annals of Behavioral Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallacher2011&quot;&gt;Gallacher, David and John Gallacher. 2011. Are Relationships Good For Your Health? Choose Your Partner Carefully. Student BMJ.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, unhappily married couples may not receive the same health benefits and may actually be less healthy than their single peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holt-Lunstad2008&quot;/&gt;

===Children===
Kids raised in families with only one parent or with step-parents are more likely to have behavior problems than are kids raised with parents that remain connected throughout the child's life course.  Previous research has attributed this to the fact that single-parent households tend to be poorer than dual-parent households and poverty is related to behavior problems.  A recent study by Marcia Carlson&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson2006&quot;&gt;Carlson, Marcia J. 2006. Family Structure, Father Involvement, and Adolescent Behavioral Outcomes. Journal of Marriage and the Family. 68:1, 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt; adds a clue as to why children raised in single-parent households or households with step-parents might have more behavior problems. According to Carlson's study of nearly 3,000 teens, children whose fathers are more involved in their lives are less likely to have behavior problems. When the relationship between a child and the father is missing, children in single-parent and step-parent families are more likely to act out in negative ways. One way to reduce behavior problems in teenagers is to encourage a close relationship between them and their fathers.  There is also some evidence that the gender of children increases father involvement in the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raley2006&quot;&gt;Raley, Sara, and Suzanne Bianchi. 2006. “Sons, Daughters, and Family Processes: Does Gender of Children Matter?.” Annual Review of Sociology 32:401-421.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while having an active father helps improve behavior problems, fathers having sons helps improve their dedication and devotion to their families.  Expanding on these findings, longitudinal studies of family development have revealed that active parental involvement - regardless of gender (e.g., by fathers, mothers, and / or other designated parental units) - lies at the heart of this relationship, and thus it is most important to provide children with stable, active parental guardians regardless of the origins of these individuals within the life course of the child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bos2012&quot;&gt;Henny Bos, Naomi Goldberg, Loes Van Gelderen and Nanette Gartrell.  2012.  Adolescents of the U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study : Male Role Models, Gender Role Traits, and Psychological Adjustment.  Gender &amp; Society 26: 603-638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent finding related to children is that parents have less influence on their childs' mate selections now than they used to.  Rosenfeld and Kim&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld2005&quot;&gt;Rosenfeld, Michael J. and Kim, Byung-Soo. 2005. The Independence of Young Adults and the Rise of Interracial and Same-Sex Unions. American Sociological Review. 70:4, 541-562.&lt;/ref&gt; found that a new life stage has developed in the latter half of the 20th century that they call the &quot;independent life stage.&quot;  This life stage is a period of time in which young adults leave home and live alone (often to go to college). Children used to remain in their parents home until they left to start their own family, but the independent life stage is a period of single-living prior to the formation of one's own family. As a result of this life stage, which also overlaps with the time in most children's' lives when they are beginning to look for life partners, parents are decreasingly involved in the decision-making process. Rosenfeld and Kim attribute the increase in interracial and same-sex marriages to the increasing prevalence of this life stage.

How parents raise children and childhood autonomy have also changed over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rutherford2009&quot;&gt;Rutherford, Markella. n.d. “Children’s Autonomy and Responsibility: An Analysis of Childrearing Advice.” Qualitative Sociology. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11133-009-9136-2 (Accessed August 6, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing back issues of Parents magazine, Markella Rutherford found that parents face a difficult task of trying to balance authority with childhood autonomy.  Children have gained more autonomy in private spaces in their homes (e.g., they are allowed to decorate their own rooms) but have lost autonomy in public areas outside the home (e.g., they are not allowed to go to the park alone).  Some of the loss of autonomy is the result of a growing fear among parents of child predators, which is generally over-stated.  This same factor may help explain the increase in autonomy in the home, as parents are trying to compensate for heightened supervision outside the home by allowing children greater freedom inside the home.  It is also now known that most parents regularly lie to their children, though this is typically done in the interest of getting kids to behave in positive ways.  Known as &quot;parenting by lying,&quot; the practice appears to be widespread and ironic, considering most parents also tell their kids not to lie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyman2009&quot;&gt;Heyman, Gail D., Diem H. Luu, and Kang Lee. 2009. “Parenting by Lying.” Journal of Moral Education 38(3):353–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another shift in parenting has been a reduction in the use of [[w:corporal punishment|corporal punishment]].  A growing body of research has found that corporal punishment is not an effective technique for modifying children's behavior.  For instance, one study found that most kids who were spanked began misbehaving within about 10 minutes of having been spanked, suggesting that the efficacy of corporal punishment for changing behavior is quite limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holden2014&quot;&gt;Holden, G. W., Williamson, P. A., &amp; O, W. (2014). Eavesdropping on the family: A pilot investigation of corporal punishment in the home. Journal of Family Psychology, 28(3), 401–406. doi:10.1037/a0036370&lt;/ref&gt;

Kids are closely connected to a family's socioeconomic status as well.  Kids are expensive to raise, and the more kids a family has, on average, the lower the social class (though this is a complicated relationship as the causal direction goes both ways).  One illustration of this is the upward mobility of Catholics in the U.S. over the past few decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keister2007&quot;&gt;Keister, Lisa A. 2007. Upward Wealth Mobility: Exploring the Roman Catholic Advantage. Social Forces. 85(3):1195-1225&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholics in the U.S. used to be among the lower-middle sector of the population in terms of income and wealth.  But as of the 1990s and 2000s, Catholics in the U.S. rank higher, just above the middle.  Part of the reason for this has been a decrease in the size of Catholic families; Catholics are having about the same number of children as are non-Catholics in the U.S.  With smaller families, Catholics are able to retain more of their income and turn it into savings, improving their socioeconomic status.  Thus, the reduction in the number of kids among Catholics has actually improved their socioeconomic status on average.

===Divorce===
[[Image:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|thumb|200px|right|In some cultures, when a spouse dies, it is customary for the widow or widower to indicate their loss by dressing in specific ways and following certain behavioral guidelines.  This is a painting of [[w:Catherine de Medicis|Catherine de Medicis]] wearing the clothing of a widow from the 16th Century.]]

Numerous studies have tried to determine why close to 50 percent of marriages end in divorce within the first 25 years in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. The Way We Never
Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrie Yodanis&lt;ref name=&quot;Yodanis2005&quot;&gt;Yodanis, Carrie. 2005. “Divorce Culture and Marital Gender Equality: A Cross-National Study.” Gender and Society 19:644-659.&lt;/ref&gt; takes a different approach, analyzing marriages that remain intact. Her cross-national study of 22 countries suggests that where there is more tolerance of divorce, there is greater gender equality within marriage. Most researchers think that women are disadvantaged by the ease of divorce. Where divorce is an option, women may feel more insecure and are therefore reluctant to push for change within a marriage. Contradicting these claims, Yodanis shows that the ease of divorce increases women's equality within marriage. Divorce is a negotiating tool for women who seek change in their relationships. In countries with greater acceptance of divorce, there is a more equal division of household work. Men risk losing their wives if they refuse to shape up and help out around the house. Thus, while divorce has helped many women leave unhealthy marriages in which they are at risk of great physical and mental harm, the ability to get a divorce easily may also strengthen marriages.

Another factor that contributes to high divorce rates is the change in laws that made divorce easier in the 1970s in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt; The introduction of &quot;[[w:No-fault divorce|No-fault divorce]]&quot; laws removed the burden of proving that one's spouse had caused irreparable damage to the relationship (through adultery, battery, etc.).  Women's rights advocates pushed for this change as it facilitated women's ability to exit unhealthy marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt;  Other factors that may have also contributed to the rise in divorces is a cultural mystique that suggests marriage should be blissful and not have any problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt;  This is a common depiction of marriage in media, but is far from an accurate portrayal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2000&quot;/&gt;  The unrealistic expectations many couples bring to marriage heightens the probability of divorce if things don't align with those expectations. 

The increasing participation of women in the workforce has provided women with greater financial security.  With financial security comes independence.  Thus, women's workforce participation also increases the odds of divorce, though this is similar to Yodanis's argument - it really just empowers women who are in bad marriages to feel like they can leave the marriage and not experience a dramatic decline in quality of life.

Finally, there is a social-psychological component to divorce as well.  People have a tendency to unfairly judge other peoples' behavior as being &quot;part of who they are&quot; or part of their identity.  However, they do not hold themselves to the same critical judgment; when they do something that is mean, it is situationally determined and doesn't reflect their identity.  This is known as the [[w:fundamental attribution error|fundamental attribution error]] and can lead to the dissolution of relationships.  This occurs when the parties in the relationship attribute the negative behaviors they dislike to fundamental characteristics of the person rather than to the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tavris2007&quot;&gt;Tavris, Carol, and Elliot Aronson. 2007. Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts. 1st ed. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence to suggest that specific types of couple therapy can help couples see where they are committing the fundamental attribution error and substantially reduce the odds of divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anker2009&quot;&gt;Anker, M. G., Duncan, B. L., &amp; Sparks, J. A. (2009). Using client feedback to improve couple therapy outcomes: A randomized clinical trial in a naturalistic setting. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 77(4), 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divorce and widowhood carry with them the burden of reduced health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waite2009&quot;&gt;Waite, Linda and Mary Elizabeth Hughes. 2009. Marital Biography and Health Midlife. Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;  Divorced people have 20% more chronic health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, cancer) than do married people.  They also have 23% more mobility limitations (e.g., climbing stairs or walking a block).  Divorcees experience declines in health because of two things that accompany divorce: reduced income&lt;ref name=&quot;Angier2009&quot;&gt;Angier, Natalie. 2009. “Skipping Spouse to Spouse Isn’t Just a Man’s Game.” The New York Times, September 1 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/science/01angi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss (Accessed February 22, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and stresses over the dissolution of the marriage (e.g., things like negotiating child care). These differences in health remain even after an individual remarries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waite2009&quot;/&gt;

===Death and Widowing===
In most societies, the death of one of the partners terminates the marriage, and in monogamous societies this allows the other partner to remarry.  A spouse who outlives the other is referred to as a [[w:widow|widow]] (cis and trans women) or [[w:widower|widower]] (cis and trans men).

==Families and Inequality==
===Gender===
While heterosexual marriage does increase the socioeconomic status of women, men reap many benefits from this type of living arrangement. For instance, while many women manage a household's finances, men generally retain control of the money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgoyne2006&quot;&gt;Burgoyne, Carole B., Victoria Clarke, Janet Reibstein, and Anne Edmunds. “‘All my worldly goods I share with you’? Managing money at the transition to heterosexual marriage..” Sociological Review 54, no. 4 (November 2006): 619-637.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when heterosexual couples divorce, women are much less affluent and a large percentage of divorced, single women fall below poverty lines.  Men also obtain greater mental health benefits from heterosexual marriage than do women and report greater marital satisfaction than do women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowers1991&quot;&gt;Fowers, Blaine J. “His and Her Marriage: A Multivariate Study of Gender and Marital Satisfaction..” Sex Roles 24, no. 3/4 (February 1991): 209-221.&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater marital satisfaction heterosexual men report is likely the result of the benefits they receive from marriage - companionship and household labor - while not having to sacrifice occupational success or career advancement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horwitz1991&quot;&gt;Horwitz, Allan V., and Helene Raskin White. “Becoming Married, Depression, and Alcohol Problems Among Young Adults..” Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior 32, no. 3 (1991): 221-237.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heterosexual married women, on the other hand, do often have to sacrifice occupational success or career advancement, leading to many highly skilled women leaving the workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;stone2007&quot;&gt;stone, pamela. 2007. “the rhetoric and reality of “opting out”.” Contexts 6:14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these women leave because the work environment does not allow for a balance between work and family; the lack of flexible work options for highly skilled women results in many of them &quot;opting out&quot; of the workforce, which is not a problem for heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=&quot;stone2007&quot;/&gt;  Heterosexual married women also have higher rates of mental illness than do single, widowed, and divorced women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gove1972&quot;&gt;Gove, Walter R. “The Relationship Between Sex Roles, Marital Status, and Mental Illness..” Social Forces 51, no. 1 (1972): 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who marry at younger ages generally have lower educational attainment (though the causal direction here goes both ways), have more kids, and are also more dependent on their husbands financially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh1996&quot;&gt;Susheela Singh and Renee Samara, “Early Marriage Among Women in Developing Countries,” December 1996, http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2214896.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, the benefits of heterosexual marriage tend to favor men over women.

One way in which marriage has begun to shift toward a more egalitarian relationship between men and women is in the influence of education.  For much of the 20th century, women who had more education than their husbands were at a greater risk of divorce than were women who had less education than their husbands.  However, recent research suggests this is no longer the case.  Couples married in the 1990s or later in which both individuals have equal levels of education are now less likely to divorce than are couples in which the husbands has more education and women with higher levels of education are no longer at increased risk of divorce either.  This suggests a move away from the breadwinner (traditionally male) and homemaker (traditionally female) family model toward a more egalitarian family model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2014&quot;&gt;Schwartz, Christine R., and Hongyun Han. 2014. “The Reversal of the Gender Gap in Education and Trends in Marital Dissolution.” American Sociological Review 79(4):605–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and Ethnicity===
Societies have also at times required marriage from within a certain group. Anthropologists refer to these restrictions as [[w:endogamy|endogamy]]. An example of such restrictions would be a requirement to marry someone from the same tribe. [[w:Racism|Racist]] laws adopted by some societies in the past, such as [[w:Nazism|Nazi]]-era [[w:Germany]], [[w:History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid-era]] [[w:South Africa|South Africa]] and most of the [[w:United States|United States]] in the first half of the 20th century, which prohibited [[w:miscegenation|marriage between persons of different races]], could also be considered examples of endogamy. In the U.S., these laws were largely repealed between 1940 and 1960. The U.S. Supreme Court declared all such laws unconstitutional in the case of [[w:Loving v. Virginia|Loving v. Virginia]] in 1967.

Cultures that practiced [[w:slavery|slavery]] might admit that slave marriages formed but grant them no legal status. This was the practice under the Roman empire, so that in the [[w:Saints Perpetua and Felicitas|Acts of Perpetua and Felicitas]], the freewoman Perpetua could be described as &quot;a married matron&quot; but Felicitas as the &quot;fellow-servant&quot; of Revocatus — even though the Christians regarded, religiously, such marriages as binding. Likewise, slave marriages in the United States were not binding, so that many [[w:Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] escaping slavery during the [[w:American Civil War|American Civil War]] sought official status for their marriages. Among the rights distinguishing [[w:serfdom|serfdom]] from slavery was the right to enter a legally recognizable heterosexual marriage.

===Religion===
The participants in a marriage usually seek social recognition for their relationship, and many societies require official approval of a religious or civil body. In the Protestant tradition, Calvin and his colleagues reformulated marriage through enactment of The Marriage Ordinance of Geneva, imposing, &quot;The dual requirements of state registration and church consecration to constitute marriage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte1997&quot;&gt;Witte, John Jr. 1997. From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition. Westminster John Knox Press. (pp. 39-40). ISBN 0664255434&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales, it was [[w:Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act|Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act]] that first required a formal ceremony of marriage, thereby curtailing the practice of [[w:Fleet Marriage|Fleet Marriage]]. 

In many jurisdictions, the civil marriage ceremony may take place during the religious marriage ceremony, although they are theoretically distinct. In most American states, the marriage may be officiated by a [[w:priest|priest]], [[w:Religious minister|minister]], [[w:rabbi|rabbi]]  or other religious authority, and in such a case the religious authority acts simultaneously as an agent of the state.  In some countries, such as [[w:France|France]], [[w:Spain|Spain]], [[w:Germany|Germany]], [[w:Turkey|Turkey]], [[w:Argentina|Argentina]], and [[w:Russia|Russia]], it is necessary to be married by the state before having a religious ceremony.  

Conversely, there are people who have religious ceremonies that are not recognized by civil authorities.  Examples include [[w:widow|widow]]s who stand to lose a pension if they remarry and so undergo a marriage only in the eyes of God and the community; lesbian, gay and bisexual couples with same-sex partners (where same-sex marriage is not legally recognized); some sects which recognize polygamy (see, [[w:Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalism]]), retired couples who would lose pension benefits if legally married, Muslim men who wish to engage in polygamy that is condoned in some situations under [[w:Islam|Islam]], polyamorous couples and groups that seek ceremonial celebration of commitment (where polyamory is not legally recognized), and immigrants who do not wish to alert the immigration authorities that they are married either to a spouse they are leaving behind or because the complexity of immigration laws may make it difficult for spouses to visit on a tourist visa.

In [[w:Europe|Europe]], it has traditionally been the churches' office to make marriages official by registering them. It was a significant step towards a clear [[w:separation of church and state|separation of church and state]] and advance toward a secular society when German Chancellor [[w:Otto von Bismarck|Otto von Bismarck]] introduced the ''Zivilehe'' (civil marriage) in 1875. This law made the declaration of the marriage before an official clerk of the civil administration (spouses affirming their will to marry) the procedure to make a marriage legally valid and effective, and reduced the clerical marriage to a private ceremony.

Most of the world's major religions tell people they should marry before having [[w:sexual intercourse|sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ontario2006&quot;&gt;Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance. December 31, 2006. Human Sexuality and Gender Topics: Subjects of major concern to many faith groups.     http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_sex.htm. Accessed February 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They teach that unmarried people should not have sex, which they refer to as [[w:fornication|fornication]]. Fornication is sometimes socially discouraged or even criminalized. Sex with a married person other than one's spouse(s), called [[w:adultery|adultery]], is generally condemned by most religions and has even been criminalized in some countries. Despite this condemnation, it is a widespread practice. About 10-15% of women and 20-25% of men in the U.S. engage in extramarital sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements1994&quot;&gt;Clements, M. 1994.

For the most part, religious traditions in the world reserve marriage to heterosexual unions but there are exceptions including the [[w:Unitarian Universalist|Unitarian Universalists]] and [[w:Metropolitan Community Church|Metropolitan Community Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbus2002&quot;&gt;Columbus School of Law at The Catholic University of America. &quot;World Religions and Same Sex Marriage.&quot; Washington, DC.

==New Developments in Families==
===One-Parent Households===
One recent trend illustrating the changing nature of families is the rise in prevalence of single-parent or one-parent households.  While somewhat more common prior to the 20th century due to the more frequent deaths of spouses, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the nuclear family (husband, wife, and kids) became the societal norm in most Western nations.  But what was believed to be the prevailing norm for much of the 20th century is no longer the actual norm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2006&quot;&gt;Roberts, S. (2006). It’s Official: To Be Married Means to Be Outnumbered. The New York Times. Retrieved October 15, 2006, from http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/us/15census.html&lt;/ref&gt; nor is it perceived as such.

In the 1950s, most people believed that single-parent households were &quot;immoral,&quot; but by 1978, only 25% of Americans held that belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;/&gt;  Legal reforms in the 1960s and 1970s expanded the rights of nonmarital children and unwed mothers, breaking down the distinction between &quot;legitimate&quot; and &quot;illegitimate&quot;.  Additionally, the declining purchasing power of male wages in the 1970s along with the increased levels of education among women led to an increasing percentage of married women (with and without kids) to enter the workforce. This change in the economic structure of the U.S. (i.e., the inability to support a nuclear family on a single wage), had significant ramifications on family life.  Women and men began delaying the age of first marriage in order to invest in their earning power before marriage by spending more time in school.  The increased levels of education among women - women now earn more than 50% of bachelor's degrees - positioned women to survive, economically, without the support of a husband.  By 1997, 40% of births to unmarried American women were intentional, and, despite a still prominent gender gap in pay, women are able to survive as single mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coontz2006&quot;/&gt;

However, despite their ability to support their children, single parents often struggle financially to make ends meet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutchler2009&quot;&gt;Mutchler, Jan E., and Lindsey A. Baker. 2009. “The Implications of Grandparent Coresidence for Economic Hardship Among Children in Mother-Only Families.” Journal of Family Issues 0192513X09340527.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence, however, that when single parents move in with their parents (i.e., the child's grandparents), the odds of the single-parent led family falling under the poverty line are reduced by 80%.  Thus, three generation households are more financially secure environments for raising children than are two generation households if it is a single parent who is trying to raise children alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutchler2009&quot;/&gt;

===Cohabitation===
[[File:Household types in the us 2006.png|thumb|right|300px|This figure shows that roughly 5% of households in the U.S. are made up of cohabiting couples of various types: heterosexual, gay, or lesbian.]]

[[w:Cohabitation|Cohabitation]] is an intimate relationship which includes a common living place and which exists without the benefit of legal, cultural, or religious sanction.  It can be seen as an alternative form of marriage, in that, in practice, it is similar to marriage, but it does not receive the same formal recognition by religions, governments, or cultures or the multitude of privileges and governmental benefits granted to officially sanctioned marriages.

The cohabiting population, although inclusive of all ages, is mainly made up of those between the ages of 25 and 34.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday2005&quot;&gt;USA Today. July 17, 2005. Cohabitation is replacing dating. http://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2005-07-17-cohabitation_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Several common reasons that lead couples and groups to decide to live together include: 
*wanting to test compatibility or establish financial security before marrying
*a desire to live as married when [[w:same-sex marriages|same-sex marriages]] and / or polyamory are not legal
*living with someone before marriage as a way to avoid divorce
*a way for polygamists to avoid anti-polygamy laws
*a way to avoid the higher income taxes paid by some 2-income married couples (in the United States)
*seeing little difference between the commitment to live together and the commitment of marriage

[[File:Us births by mother's living situation.png|right|thumb|300px|This figure illustrates that, while the number of children being born to &quot;unwed&quot; mothers has increased over time, many of those children are born to women who are cohabiting.]]

While cohabitation does address all of the issues above, it does not improve the quality or duration of marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades2009&quot;&gt;Rhoades, Galena K., Scott M. Stanley, and Howard J. Markman. 2009. “The pre-engagement cohabitation effect: A replication and extension of previous findings..” Journal of Family Psychology 23:107-111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who cohabit before engagement (about 43% of all couples) report slightly lower marital satisfaction, dedication, and confidence as well as more negative communication as compared with individuals who cohabit after engagement (16.4% of all couples in the US) and those who cohabit after marriage (40.5% of couples in the US).  Early cohabitors also have a great potential for divorce.  The differences are generally small, but are not attributable to demographic differences between the three groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades2009&quot;/&gt;

Some couples prefer cohabitation because it does not legally commit them for an extended period of time, and because it is easier to establish and dissolve.  In some countries (such as [[w:Scotland|Scotland]]) and some states in the United States, cohabiting is viewed as a legal relationship and is referred to as a [[w:common-law marriage|common-law marriage]] after the duration of a specified period or the birth of a child to the couple. In California, such couples are defined as people who &quot;have chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring,&quot; including having a &quot;common residence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaliforniaCode&quot;&gt;See California Family Code Section 297 http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=297-297.5&lt;/ref&gt; This recognition led to the creation of a Domestic Partners Registry,&lt;ref name=&quot;DomesticPR&quot;&gt;http://www.ss.ca.gov/dpregistry &quot;Domestic Partners Registry&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; which is available to same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples in which at least one of the partners is age 62 or older, granting them limited legal recognition and some rights similar to those of married couples. Today, seven states (North Carolina, Mississippi, Virginia, West Virginia, Florida, Idaho and Michigan) still criminalize cohabitation by opposite-sex couples, although anti-cohabitation laws are generally not enforced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wetzel1997&quot;&gt;Wetzel, Dale. 1997. Anti-Cohabitation Law Repealed. Time Magazine. March 1st, 2007. http://web.archive.org/web/20070311160039/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1595319,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In most States of the United States, there is no legal registration or definition of cohabitation, so demographers have developed various methods of identifying cohabitation and measuring its prevalence.  The most important of these is the [[w:Census|Census Bureau]], which currently describes an &quot;unmarried partner&quot; as &quot;A person age 15 years and over, who is not related to the householder, who shares living quarters, and who has a close personal relationship with the householder.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusHTR&quot;&gt;http://www.census.gov/acs/www/UseData/Def/Hhld_rel.htm &quot;Household Type and Relationship&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1995, the Bureau euphemistically identified any &quot;unrelated&quot; opposite-sex couple living with no other adults as [[w:POSSLQ|POSSLQ]]s, or Persons of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters (these numbers are still reported to show historical trends).&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusDE&quot;&gt;http://www.census.gov/population/www/cps/cpsdef.html &quot;Current Population Survey (CPS) - Definitions and Explanations&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohabitation often does not have clear start and end dates, as people move in and out of each other's homes and sometimes do not agree on the definition of their living arrangement at a particular moment in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning2005&quot;&gt;Manning, Wendy D. and Pamela J. Smock. 2005. &quot;Measuring and Modeling Cohabitation: New Perspectives from Qualitative Data.&quot; Journal of Marriage and Family 67(4):989-1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 4.85 million cohabiting couples, up more than 1,000 percent from 1960, when there were 439,000 such couples.&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusHTR&quot;/&gt; More than half of couples in the US lived together, at least briefly, before walking down the aisle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades2009&quot;/&gt; In [[w:Sweden|Sweden]], [[w:Denmark|Denmark]] and [[w:Norway|Norway]], cohabitation is very common; roughly 50% of all children are born into families of unmarried couples. In late 2005, 21% of families in [[w:Finland|Finland]] consisted of cohabiting couples (all age groups). Of couples with children, 18% were cohabiting. Generally, cohabitation amongst Finns is most common for people under 30. Legal obstacles for cohabitation were removed in 1926 in a reform of the Finnish penal code. In the [[w:UK|UK]] 25% of children are now born to cohabiting parents. In [[w:France|France]], 17.5% of couples were cohabiting as of 1999.

===Same-Sex Unions===
[[Image:Hendricks-leboeuf.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A homosexual couple at their marriage ceremony.]]

While homosexuality has existed for thousands of years among both humans and other animals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagemihl1999&quot;&gt;Bagemihl, Bruce. 1999. Biological exuberance: Animal homosexuality and natural diversity. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; formal marriages between gay / lesbian partners is a relatively recent phenomenon - the earliest recorded examples were referred to as [[w: Boston Marriage|Boston Marriages]] in 19th century America. As of the summer of 2014, 19 states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex couples to legally marry, but - especially following the dismissal of half of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) by the Supreme Court in 2013 - many states are shifting their legal opinions on this matter at present and cases continually work through the legal system.  Further, the dismissal of half of DOMA in 2013 created the possibility for the federal government of the United States to recognize same-sex couples and families, which has facilitated steady opening and benefit extensions to same-sex couples via federal agencies and officials since the ruling (see [[w: Same-sex marriage in the United States|Same-sex marriage in the United States]] for regularly updated details of these ongoing changes).  

[[Image:Same-sex marriage in the United States.svg|right|thumb|200px|U.S. map showing same-sex marriage laws for individual states.]]

Given how recent same-sex marriage is in the U.S., there is very little existing data on marital dissolution rates.  There is, however, data on marital dissolution rates (i.e., divorce) in other countries where same-sex marriage has been legally allowed for a longer period of time. Andersson et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andersson2006&quot;&gt;Andersson, Gunnar; Noack, Turid; Seierstad, Ane; and Weedon-Fekjaer, Harold. 2006. The Demographics of Same-Sex Marriages in Norway and Sweden. Demography. 43:1, 79-98.&lt;/ref&gt; examined precisely this issue in Norway and Sweden, where same-sex marriages or civil unions have been legally recognized since the mid-1990s.  Andersson et al. found several ways in which lesbian/gay unions differ from heterosexual unions in these countries:

[[Image:World_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg|right|thumb|200px|World map illustrating laws regulating homosexuality by country.]]

*the average same-sex couple is older than the average heterosexual couple
*the average same-sex couple is more educated than the average heterosexual couple
*while divorce rates are higher for couples that marry younger generally (see discussion of divorce above), the divorce rate is slightly higher for same-sex couples than heterosexual couples
*female same-sex couples are more likely to divorce than are male same-sex couples

Andersson et al. attribute the higher divorce rate to a combination of factors, including: less support from the community and less encouragement or pressure from family and friends to make the marriage last.

One question often raised about same-sex unions is how it influences any children raised in these households. Are children raised by same-sex parents more likely to be lesbian, gay, or even bisexual or asexual? The answer is surprising to some: No. Children raised in same-sex parented households (or mixed-orientation households - households composed of two or more people of varied sexual identities) are no more or less likely to be homosexual than children raised in heterosexual households.  Even so, there are some differences. For instance, children raised in same-sex households have more complex perspectives on sexuality and have well-articulated responses to discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien2006&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Jodi. 2006. All Aboard the Good Ship (Gay) Family Values. Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds. 5:4, 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, recent findings concerning adolescents raised in planned lesbian families suggests these children do as well or better on all social indicators as children raised in heterosexual and / or mixed-orientation households.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bos2012&quot;/&gt;

===Childfree===
Some married couples and groups remain [[w:childfree|childless by choice]] or due to [[w:infertility|infertility]], age, or other factors preventing reproduction.

==Additional Reading==
Some couples have made a concerted effort to balance home and work responsibilities so they literally split everything 50/50.  Yet, doing so is difficult.  This [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15parenting-t.html New York Times Magazine] article examines this relatively new trend.

Family sociologist Phillip N. Cohen maintains an ongoing blog sharing and discussing the latest issues in family developments, inequalities, and experiences through the dissemination of published findings and the analyses of existing (and at times newly established) data sets that may be useful for further understanding the complexities of family dynamics in the contemporary world.

| I remember when I first became active in social movements seeking racial, class, gender, and sexual equality for all in the 1990’s.  While I would like to say I did this for moral or practical reasons, my teenage mind had yet to consider such reasoning.  Rather, like most people, I became involved due to emotional pulls based on my own life experiences.

I first learned about movements while I attended support groups for transgender people seeking to reconcile their gender with their religious beliefs.  In so doing, I learned very quickly that the problems I thought were mine alone were actually shared by many people.  Instead of continuing to believe I was damaged, I learned in those meetings to recognize the ways existing social structures damage certain groups, which led me to become active in protests and other social movement activities seeking to make life better for those living in the margins of society.

While special to me, my experience is rather common (as the histories of people like [[w:Alice Paul|Alice Paul]] and [[w:Bayard Rustin|Bayard Rustin]] illustrate).  Like me, most activists begin fighting structural inequality because they feel the pain of oppression in their own lives, but it is due to their efforts that many of us walk around everyday without knowing that: [[w:Alice_Paul#Silent_Sentinels|women were starved almost to death]] by the American government so other women could vote; [[w:Lynching_in_the_United_States|African-Americans were beat, killed, set on fire, and tailed by the FBI]] so they could vote and go to school; [[w:Violence against LGBT people|sexual minorities were institutionalized, imprisoned, and killed on public streets]] so they could have jobs, families, and educations; or that once upon a time something as simple as [[w:Union busting|a lunch break or a fire escape were unheard of]] in most American workplaces.

Like I did as a teenager, ask yourself what rights do you have that other people died for, and what rights do other people currently lack that you could be helping them achieve?

==Introduction==
'''Social movements''' are any broad social alliances of people who are connected through their shared interest in blocking or affecting social change.  Social movements do not have to be formally organized.  Multiple alliances may work separately for common causes and still be considered a social movement.

A distinction is drawn between social movements and ''social movement organizations'' (SMOs).  A social movement organization is a formally organized component of a social movement.  But an SMO may only make up a part of a particular social movement.  For instance, [[w:People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals|PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) advocates for vegan lifestyles along with its other aims.  But PETA is not the only group to advocate for vegan diets and lifestyles; there are numerous other groups actively engaged toward this end (see [[w:vegan|vegan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer2002&quot;&gt;Maurer, Donna. 2002. Vegetarianism: Movement or Moment? Philadelphia: Temple University Press. ISBN 156639936X&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the social movement may be a push toward veganism (an effort with numerous motivations)&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer2002&quot;/&gt; and PETA is an SMO working within the broader social movement.

Modern social movements became possible through the wider dissemination of literature and increased mobility of labor due to the industrialization of societies.  Organised social structures like modern day armies, political societies, and popular movements required freedom of expression, education and relative economic independence. 

Giddens&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddens1985&quot;&gt;Giddens, Anthony. 1985. The Nation-State and Violence. Cambridge, England: Polity Press. ISBN 0520060393&lt;/ref&gt; has identified four areas in which social movements operate in modern societies:
#democratic movements that work for political rights
#labor movements that work for control of the workplace
#ecological movements that are concerned with the environment
#peace movements that work toward, well, peace

It is also interesting to note that social movements can spawn counter movements.  For instance, the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a number of counter movements that attempted to block the goals of the women's movement, many of which were reform movements within conservative religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaves1997&quot;&gt;Chaves, Mark. 1997. Ordaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. ISBN 0674641469&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Social Movements==
Aberle&lt;ref name=&quot;Aberle1966&quot;&gt;Aberle, David F. 1966. The Peyote Religion among the Navaho. Chicago: Aldine. ISBN 0806123826&lt;/ref&gt; described four types of social movements based upon two characteristics: (1) who is the movement attempting to change and (2) how much change is being advocated.  Social movements can be aimed at change on an individual level (e.g., [[w:Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]]) or change on a broader, group or even societal level (e.g., [[w:anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]]).  Social movements can also advocate for minor changes (e.g., tougher restrictions on drunk driving; see [[w:Mothers_Against_Drunk_Driving|MADD]]) or radical changes (e.g., [[w:prohibition|prohibition]]).

==Stages in Social Movements==
Blumer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumer1969&quot;&gt;Blumer, Herbert G. 1969. &quot;Collective Behavior.&quot; In Alfred McClung Lee, ed., Principles of Sociology. Third Edition. New York: Barnes and Noble Books, pp. 65-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Mauss,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mauss1975&quot;&gt;Mauss, Armand L. 1975. Social Problems of Social Movements. Philadelphia: Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tilly&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilly1978&quot;&gt;Tilly, Charles. 1978. From Mobilization to Revolution. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; have described different stages social movements often pass through. Movements emerge for a variety of reasons (see the theories below), coalesce, and generally bureaucratize.  At that point, they can take a number of paths, including: finding some form of movement success, failure, co-optation of leaders, repression by larger groups (e.g., government), or even the establishment of the movement within the mainstream.  

Whether these paths will result in movement decline or not varies from movement to movement.  In fact, one of the difficulties in studying social movements is that movement success is often ill-defined because movement goals can change.  For instance, [http://www.moveon.org MoveOn.org], a website founded in the late 1990s, was originally developed to encourage national politicians to move past the Clinton impeachment proceedings (see [http://www.moveon.org/about/ here]). Since that time, the group has developed into a major player in national politics in the U.S. and developed into a [[w:Political Action Committee|Political Action Committee or PAC]]. In this instance, the movement may or may not have attained its original goal - encouraging the censure of Clinton and moving on to more pressing issues - but the goals of the SMO have changed.  This makes the actual stages the movement has passed through difficult to discern.

[[image:Stages of social movements.svg|center|thumb|400px]]

==Social Movement Theories==
A variety of theories have attempted to explain how social movements develop.  Some of the better-known approaches are outlined below. 

===Deprivation Theory===
''Deprivation Theory'' argues that social movements have their foundations among people who feel deprived of some good(s) or resource(s).  According to this approach, individuals who are lacking some good, service, or comfort are more likely to organize a social movement to improve (or defend) their conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrison1978&quot;&gt;Morrison, Denton E. 1978. &quot;Some Notes toward Theory on Relative Deprivation, Social Movements, and Social Change.&quot; In Louis E. Genevie, ed., Collective Behavior and Social Movements. Itasca, Ill.: Peacock. pp. 202-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two significant problems with this theory.  First, since most people feel deprived at one level or another almost all the time, the theory has a hard time explaining why the groups that form social movements do when other people are also deprived.  Second, the reasoning behind this theory is circular - often the only evidence for deprivation is the social movement. If deprivation is claimed to be the cause but the only evidence for such is the movement, the reasoning is circular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins1977&quot;&gt;Jenkins, J. Craig and Perrow, Charles. 1977. Insurgency of the Powerless Farm Worker Movements (1946-1972). American Sociological Review. 42(2):249-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass-Society Theory===
''Mass-Society Theory'' argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached.  Social movements, according to this theory, provide a sense of empowerment and belonging that the movement members would otherwise not have.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kornhauser1959&quot;&gt;Kornhauser, William. 1959. The Politics of Mass Society. New York: Free Press. ISBN 0029176204&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little support has been found for this theory.  Aho,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aho1990&quot;&gt;Aho, James Alfred. 1990. Politics of Righteousness: Idaho Christian Patriotism. Washington: University of Washington Press. ISBN 0295969970&lt;/ref&gt; in his study of Idaho Christian Patriotism, did not find that members of that movement were more likely to have been socially detached.  In fact, the key to joining the movement was having a friend or associate who was a member of the movement.

===Structural-Strain Theory===
''Structural-Strain Theory'' proposes six factors that encourage social movement development:&lt;ref name=&quot;Smelser1962&quot;&gt;Smelser, Neil J. 1962. Theory of Collective Behavior. New York: Free Press. ISBN 0029293901&lt;/ref&gt;
#structural conduciveness - people come to believe their society has problems
#structural strain - people experience deprivation
#growth and spread of a solution - a solution to the problems people are experiencing is proposed and spreads
#precipitating factors - discontent usually requires a catalyst (often a specific event) to turn it into a social movement
#lack of social control - the entity that is to be changed must be at least somewhat open to the change; if the social movement is quickly and powerfully repressed, it may never materialize
#mobilization - this is the actual organizing and active component of the movement; people do what needs to be done

This theory is also subject to circular reasoning as it incorporates, at least in part, deprivation theory and relies upon it, and social/structural strain for the underlying motivation of social movement activism.  However, social movement activism is, like in the case of deprivation theory, often the only indication that there was strain or deprivation.

===Resource-Mobilization Theory===
''Resource-Mobilization Theory'' emphasizes the importance of resources in social movement development and success. Resources are understood here to include: knowledge, money, media, labor, solidarity, legitimacy, and internal and external support from power elite.  The theory argues that social movements develop when individuals with grievances are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.  The emphasis on resources offers an explanation why some discontented/deprived individuals are able to organize while others are not.

Some of the assumptions of the theory include:
*there will always be grounds for protest in modern, politically pluralistic societies because there is constant discontent (i.e., grievances or deprivation); this de-emphasizes the importance of these factors as it makes them ubiquitous
*actors are rational; they weigh the costs and benefits from movement participation
*members are recruited through networks; commitment is maintained by building a collective identity and continuing to nurture interpersonal relationships
*movement organization is contingent upon the aggregation of resources
*social movement organizations require resources and continuity of leadership
*social movement entrepreneurs and protest organizations are the catalysts which transform collective discontent into social movements; social movement organizations form the ''backbone'' of social movements
*the form of the resources shapes the activities of the movement (e.g., access to a TV station will result in the extensive use TV media)
*movements develop in contingent ''opportunity structures'' that influence their efforts to mobilize; as each movement's response to the opportunity structures depends on the movement's organization and resources, there is no clear pattern of movement development nor are specific movement techniques or methods universal

Critics of this theory argue that there is too much of an emphasize on resources, especially financial resources.  Some movements are effective without an influx of money and are more dependent upon the movement members for time and labor (e.g., the civil rights movement in the U.S.).

===Political Process Theory===
''Political Process Theory'' is similar to resource mobilization in many regards, but tends to emphasize a different component of social structure that is important for social movement development: political opportunities.  Political process theory argues that there are three vital components for movement formation: insurgent consciousness, organizational strength, and political opportunities.

Insurgent consciousness refers back to the ideas of deprivation and grievances.  The idea is that certain members of society feel like they are being mistreated or that somehow the system is unjust.  The insurgent consciousness is the collective sense of injustice that movement members (or potential movement members) feel and serves as the motivation for movement organization.

Organizational strength falls inline with resource-mobilization theory, arguing that in order for a social movement to organize it must have strong leadership and sufficient resources.

Political opportunity refers to the receptivity or vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge.  This vulnerability can be the result of any of the following (or a combination thereof):
*growth of political pluralism
*decline in effectiveness of repression
*elite disunity; the leading factions are internally fragmented
*a broadening of access to institutional participation in political processes
*support of organized opposition by elites

One of the advantages of the political process theory is that it addresses the issue of timing or emergence of social movements.  Some groups may have the insurgent consciousness and resources to mobilize, but because political opportunities are closed, they will not have any success.  The theory, then, argues that all three of these components are important.

Critics of the political process theory and resource-mobilization theory point out that neither theory discusses movement culture to any great degree.  This has presented culture theorists an opportunity to expound on the importance of culture.

One advance on the political process theory is the ''political mediation model,'' which outlines the way in which the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in terms of success or failure but also in terms of consequences (whether intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in terms of [[w:collective benefits|collective benefits]].

===Culture Theory===
''Culture theory'' builds upon both the political process and resource-mobilization theories but extends them in two ways.  First, it emphasizes the importance of movement culture. Second, it attempts to address the ''[[w:free rider problem|free-rider problem]]''.  

Both resource-mobilization theory and political process theory include a sense of injustice in their approaches.  Culture theory brings this sense of injustice to the forefront of movement creation by arguing that, in order for social movements to successfully mobilize individuals, they must develop an ''injustice frame''.  An injustice frame is a collection of ideas and symbols that illustrate both how significant the problem is as well as what the movement can do to alleviate it,

:&quot;Like a picture frame, an issue frame marks off some part of the world.  Like a building frame, it holds things together.  It provides coherence to an array of symbols, images, and arguments, linking them through an underlying organizing idea that suggests what is essential - what consequences and values are at stake. We do not see the frame directly, but infer its presence by its characteristic expressions and language.  Each frame gives the advantage to certain ways of talking and thinking, while it places others out of the picture.&quot; (p. 14) &lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2006&quot;&gt;Ryan, Charlotte and Gamson, William W. The Art of Reframing Political Debates. Contexts. 2006; 5(1):13-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few things we know about injustice frames:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan2006&quot;/&gt;
*Facts take on their meaning by being embedded in frames, which render them relevant and significant or irrelevant and trivial.
*People carry around multiple frames in their heads.
*Successful reframing involves the ability to enter into the worldview of our adversaries.
*All frames contain implicit or explicit appeals to moral principles.
 
In emphasizing the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the free-rider problem.  The free-rider problem refers to the idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating.  In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement.  If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits - this is ''free-riding''.  A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution.  Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.

Framing processes includes three separate components:
*Diagnostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the problem or what they are critiquing
*Prognostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the desirable solution to the problem
*Motivational frame: the movement organization frames a &quot;call to arms&quot; by suggesting and encouraging that people take action to solve the problem

'''UNDER CONSTRUCTION'''

'''Human sexuality''' is how people experience the erotic and express themselves as sexual beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rathus2007&quot;&gt;Rathus, Spencer A., Jeffrey S. Nevid, and Lois Fichner-Rathus. 2007. Human Sexuality in a World of Diversity. Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality has many aspects.
Biologically, sexuality refers to the reproductive mechanism as well as the basic biological drive that exists in all species and can encompass sexual intercourse and sexual contact in all its forms.
There are also emotional or physical aspect of sexuality, which refers to the bond that exists between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions, and which may be manifested in physical or medical concerns about the physiological or even psychological aspects of sexual behaviour.  Sociologically it can cover the cultural, political, and legal aspects; and philosophically, it can span the moral, ethical, theological, spiritual or religious aspects.

Recent studies on human sexuality have highlighted that sexual aspects are of major importance in building up personal identity and to social evolution of individuals:
&lt;blockquote&gt; “Human sexuality is not simply imposed by instinct or stereotypical conducts, as it happens in animals, but it is influenced both by superior mental activity and by social, cultural, educational and normative characteristics of those places where the subjects grow up and their personality develops. Consequently, the analysis of sexual sphere must be based on the convergence of several lines of development such as affectivity, emotions and relations”.&lt;ref name= Boccadoro &gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S. (2009) ''Il posto dell'amore negato. Sessualità e psicopatologie segrete'' ([http://www.sexology.it/abstract_english.html The place of the denied love. Sexuality and secret psychopathologies]). Tecnoprint Editrice, Ancona. &lt;small&gt;ISBN 978-88-95554-03-7&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many historical eras, recovered art and artefacts help to portray human sexuality of the time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rathus2007&quot;/&gt;

==Factors Influencing Human Sexuality==
Human sexuality can be influenced by hormonal changes in the development of the fetus during pregnancy. Some claim its manner of expression is largely due to genetic predisposition. Others say it is due to one's own personal experimentation in early life, and thus the establishment of preferences. A less divisive approach recognizes that both factors may have a mutual role to play.
A primary criticism of the idea that homosexuality is at least in part genetically determined is the fact that homosexual men are less likely to procreate, which means any genes that contribute to their sexual identity will not be passed on to offspring, suggesting the genes that contribute to their homosexual identity will die with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasey2010&quot;&gt;http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/02/04/study.reveals.potential.evolutionary.role.same.sex.attraction&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent research has found that homosexuality may follow a &quot;[[w:Kin selection|kin selection]]&quot; evolutionary model.  The basic idea of kin selection is that some individuals may not procreate, but they will work to facilitate the procreation of their relatives and the survival of their relatives' offspring. By facilitating the success of their siblings' offspring, they are, indirectly, insuring the reproduction of their genes. In one study examining this idea, the [[w:fa'afafine|fa'afafine]] of [[w:Samoa|Samoa]], gay men who are considered a distinct gender category apart from either men or women, were found to in fact be more involved in the lives of their nieces and nephews than were heterosexual aunts and uncles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasey2010&quot;/&gt;  This research supports the kin selection model of sexual identity and helps explain why there is a genetic component to homosexuality even though homosexuals are less likely than heterosexuals to procreate.

Human sexuality can also be understood as part of the social life of humans, governed by implied rules of behaviour and the ''status quo''.  Thus, it is claimed, sexuality influences social norms and society in turn influences the manner in which sexuality can be expressed. Since the invention of the mass media, sexuality has further moulded the environments in which we live; it comes to be distilled (often into stereotypes) and then repeatedly expressed in commercialized forms such as print, audio and film.

Human sexuality is distinguished from gender identity.  Gender identity is a more expansive set of roles than sexual identity.  Gender can usually be moulded by the social environment to which one is exposed as a child, e.g. an authority figure giving a little boy a toy truck to play with, and a girl a doll. Human physiology and gender moulding thus makes certain forms of sexual expression possible or even likely, but it does not predict that future sexual behaviour will be regarded as 'gender appropriate'.

Human sexual choices are usually made using current cultural norms. For example; some may choose to abstain from sex before marriage because their religion forbids such actions. In some cultures it may be acceptable for a man to have many wives, while in others bigamy or polygamy is frowned upon.  Those who wish to express a dissident sexuality often form sub-cultures, within the main culture.

==Theories of Human Sexuality==
===Sociobiology===
One study supporting sociobiological understandings of human sexuality found evidence for this in the responses of heterosexual men to &quot;cheating&quot; by their female partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confer2011&quot;&gt;Confer, Jaime C., and Mark D. Cloud. 2011. “Sex differences in response to imagining a partner's heterosexual or homosexual affair.” Personality and Individual Differences 50:129-134.&lt;/ref&gt;  If their female partners cheated with a man, they are less likely to continue dating her, than if she cheated with a woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confer2011&quot;/&gt;  This suggests that the bigger issue with cheating - for men - is not the sexual or emotional intimacy but the threat to paternity; men do not want to be cuckolded into raising another man's child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Confer2011&quot;/&gt;

==Sexuality and the Life Course==
===Childhood===

===Adolescence===
Recent research has found that there is a genetic predisposition in 20 to 30 percent of Caucasian women for [[w:premenstrual dysphoric disorder|premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD; commonly referred to as [[w:PMS|PMS]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer2010&quot;&gt;Spencer, J. L., E. M. Waters, T. A. Milner, F. S. Lee, and B. S. McEwen. 2010. “BDNF variant Val66Met interacts with estrous cycle in the control of hippocampal function.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; While the research was conducted on mice, mice and humans share the same gene.  Basically, mice with this particular gene are more irritable and insecure during certain phases of their estrous cycle (the equivalent of the human menstrual cycle).  Their memory is also impaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer2010&quot;/&gt;  These findings suggest that this may be part of the cause of PMDD in women with this gene variant.

Some groups have expressed concern over the effect of vaccinating young women against the [[w:Human papillomavirus|Human papillomavirus]], believing that it may increase their sexual activity as they may not be worried about contracting HPV.  Recent research suggests vaccinating young women against HPV did not effect sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bednarczyk2012&quot;&gt;Bednarczyk, R. A., Davis, R., Ault, K., Orenstein, W., &amp; Omer, S. B. (2012). Sexual Activity–Related Outcomes After Human Papillomavirus Vaccination of 11- to 12-Year-Olds. Pediatrics. doi:10.1542/peds.2012-1516&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescent females who had been vaccinated against HPV were no more or less likely to engage in sexual activity than were young women who were not vaccinated.

===Adulthood===
New parents (i.e., coparents of a newborn child) tend to experience a decline in sexual activity.  While for some women, pain following childbirth may reduce sexual interest, for many people, the decline in sexual activity as new parents is primarily due to the stresses associated with caring for a newborn, including lack of sleep and the many other tasks that must be addressed with childcare.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanAnders2013&quot;&gt;Van Anders, Sari M., Lauren E. Hipp, and Lisa Kane Low. 2013. “Exploring Co-Parent Experiences of Sexuality in the First 3 Months after Birth.” The Journal of Sexual Medicine 10(8):1988–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elderly===

==Differences in Sexuality Between Men and Women==
One notable difference between men and women when it comes to sexuality is men's greater interest in casual sex.  Men are far more interested in casual sex than are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schützwohl2009&quot;&gt;Schützwohl, Achim, Amrei Fuchs, William McKibbin, and Todd Shackelford. n.d. “How Willing Are You to Accept Sexual Requests from Slightly Unattractive to Exceptionally Attractive Imagined Requestors?.” Human Nature. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12110-009-9067-3 (Accessed August 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with their greater interest in casual sex, men are less discriminating in their sexual partners than are women.  Women are more likely to engage in casual sex when their potential male partner is extremely attractive, but substantially less so when their partner is even moderately attractive.

As is the case with many other aspects of social life, women are also mistreated when it comes to sex.  One study found that young women and teenage girls often face efforts by male partners to sabotage birth control (including damaging condoms).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan2009&quot;&gt;Chan, Ronna L., and Sandra L. Martin. 2009. “Physical and sexual violence and subsequent contraception use among reproductive aged women.” Contraception 80:276-281.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as &quot;reproductive coercion&quot; and is often associated with physical or sexual violence.  Approximately 1 in 5 young women have experienced reproductive coercion and over 50% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner.  The motivation of such violence and coercion is typically power and control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chan2009&quot;/&gt;

Another difference that exists between men and women is an advantage some men gain by combining three traits (a.k.a. &quot;the dark triad&quot;): narcisissism, thrill-seeking, and deceit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonason2009&quot;&gt;Jonason, P. K.. Li, N. P., Webster, G. W., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (2009). The Dark Triad: Facilitating short-term mating in men. European Journal of Personality, 23, 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the men who exhibit these traits are not particularly prevalent in society, those men who do exhibit these traits do, in fact, have more success in short-term mating than do men who do not exhibit these traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonason2009&quot;/&gt;  In other words, it is at least somewhat true that &quot;bad guys do get the most girls.&quot;

==Cultural Variations in Sexuality==
Recent research has found that most parents in the US have a hard time believing that their children are interested in sex.  However, they do believe that most other kids are interested in sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elliott2012&quot;&gt;Elliott, Sinikka. 2012. Not My Kid: What Parents Believe about the Sex Lives of Their Teenagers. New York: New York University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, most parents are wrong, but this leads them to believe that their children are innocent and that their entrance into sexual activity is the result of persuasion by others and not because their children want to engage in sex.

American parents also depict sex among teenagers as something to be feared and they often forbid it.  However, Dutch parents take a completely different approach, talking to their kids about sex and even encouraging them to have sex when they are ready.  Dutch parents go so far as to encourage their children to have sex in the parents' home when they are ready to ensure it is a safe and pleasant experience.  In fact, nine out of ten Dutch parents are okay with their teenage children having sex in their home, while nine out of ten parents in the US are opposed to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schalet2011&quot;&gt;Schalet, Amy T. 2011. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These differences in sexual attitudes result in much lower rates of birth control use in the US (26%) than in Holland (63%) and much higher rates of regret (63% of boys and 69% of girls in the US wish they had waited while just 5% and 20% of boys and girls in the Netherlands wish they had).&lt;ref name=&quot;Schalet2011&quot;/&gt;  Another consequence of the attitudes about sexuality in the US is three times higher teenage pregnancy rates than in Holland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schalet2011&quot;/&gt;

==Having Sex==
Having sex is associated with better health and people who are in better health have more sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindau2010&quot;&gt;Lindau, S. T., and N. Gavrilova. 2010. “Sex, health, and years of sexually active life gained due to good health: evidence from two US population based cross sectional surveys of ageing.” BMJ 340:c810-c810.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, 38.9% of men and 16.8% of women between 75 and 85 were sexually active, and this was closely tied to health, with healthier individuals reporting greater interest in and greater frequency of sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindau2010&quot;/&gt;  In that same study the authors found that the sexually active life expectancy of 30 year-olds also varied by sex, for men it was 34.7 years and for women it was 30.7 years.  Men also express greater interest in sex and have more sex than do women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindau2010&quot;/&gt;

Some forms of contraceptive have been shown to reduce sexual pleasure.  Women who use both condoms and hormonal birth control measures report the highest levels of sexual satisfaction while women who use condoms alone reported the lowest levels of sexual enjoyment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Higgins2008&quot;&gt;Higgins, J.A., S. Hoffman, C.A. Graham, and S.A. Sanders. 2008. “Relationships between condoms, hormonal methods, and sexual pleasure and satisfaction: an exploratory analysis from the Women’s Well-Being and Sexuality Study.” Sex. Health 5:321-330.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are side effects to various forms of contraception, one side effect that is oft-repeated - weight gain associated with the birth control pill - has recently been shown to be unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelman2011&quot;&gt;Edelman, A., J.T. Jensen, M. Bulechowsky, and J. Cameron. 2011. “Combined oral contraceptives and body weight: do oral contraceptives cause weight gain? A primate model.” Human Reproduction 26:330-336.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the opposite may be true - using the birth control pill appears to increase the basal metabolic rate (in monkeys), which can lead to weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelman2011&quot;/&gt;

Some women (research is lacking on men) suffer from what is called &quot;postcoital dysphoria,&quot; or negative feelings following what is otherwise satisfactory intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bird2011&quot;&gt;Bird, Brian S., Robert D. Schweitzer, and Donald S. Strassberg. 2011. “The Prevalence and Correlates of Postcoital Dysphoria in Women.” International Journal of Sexual Health 23(1):14–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons why some women experience postcoital dysphoria are not entirely clear, but in one study it was about 10% of women who reported this feeling some or most of the time after sex (about 1/3 reported it at least occasionally).

==Sex Work==
There are many forms of sex work, ranging from the adult film industry to prostitution.

A popular perception of prostitution is that it is an &quot;unqualified evil&quot; and is oppressive to women.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;&gt;weitzer, ronald. 2007. “prostitution: facts and fictions.” Contexts 6:28-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  While that perception is true for some prostitutes, it is not true for the majority of prostitutes and is not at all descriptive of prostitutes in locations where prostitution is legal.  Those who believe the &quot;oppressive model&quot; of prostitution is true, generally believe that most prostitutes were sexually abused as children, they were forced into prostitution, usually as young adolescents, they are controlled by pimps, they are drug addicts, they are treated violently, their working conditions are awful, and that legalization would make the situation worse.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  Much of this perception is based on the media and the attention given to street prostitution, which differs dramatically from indoor prostitution.  Street prostitutes are engaged in a dangerous profession: 27% have been assaulted, 37% have been robbed, and 22% have been raped.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  However, very few were forced into this by a pimp, and rarely did they start in early adolescence (less than 20% started prior to age 16).  Some are addicted to drugs and use prostitution to support their habit; those who are using intravenous drugs are more likely to have HIV/AIDS, but those who are not are unlikely to be HIV positive.  Also, there is very little evidence to suggest street prostitutes were more likely to have been sexually assaulted as children.  But only 20% of prostitutes in the U.S. are street prostitutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;

What are the working conditions like for the remaining 80% of prostitutes?  Indoor prostitutes are working in a much safer profession: 1% have been assaulted, 2% raped, and 10% robbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  In terms of physical health, indoor prostitutes are just as healthy in terms of physical health, self-esteem, mental health, and the quality of their social networks as are non-prostitute women.  In fact, some prostitutes feel empowered by their occupation.  And where prostitution is legal, prostitutes are even healthier, safer, and more satisfied with their work.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;

Interestingly, almost 50% of Americans favor legalizing prostitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;  While likely understating the actual number, about 17% of men in the U.S. have paid for sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;weitzer2007&quot;/&gt;

==Sexual Orientation or Identity==
'''Sexual orientation''' is a pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, neither gender, or another gender. According to the American Psychological Association sexual orientation also refers to a person’s sense of &quot;personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviours expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;&gt; [http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf APA California Amicus Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is usually classified according to the sex or gender of the people who are found sexually attractive. Though people may use other labels, or none at all&lt;ref name=&quot;American Psychological Association&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apa.org/topics/sorientation.html#whatis |title=Sexuality, What is sexual orientation? |periodical=American Psychological Association: ''Sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions.... Sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual...However, some people may use different labels or none at all.'' |accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. These orientations exist along a heterosexual-homosexual continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexual to exclusive homosexual, including various forms of bisexuality in-between. The continuum between heterosexual and homosexual does not suit everyone, however, as some people identify as asexual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asexuality.org/home/&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexologists see this linear scale as an oversimplification of a more nuanced notion of sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm Planned Parent Hood: Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender, LGBTQ ... The Labels and Their Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most definitions of sexual orientation include a psychological component, such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire, or a behavioural component, which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s. Some definitions include both components. Some people prefer simply to follow an individual's self-definition or identity.

Some scholars of sexology, anthropology and history have argued that social categories such as heterosexual and homosexual are not universal. Different societies may consider other criteria to be more significant than sex, including the age disparity in sexual relationships of the partners, whether partners assume an active or a passive sexual role, and their social status.

Sexual identity and sexual behaviour are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behaviour referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to &quot;fantasies, attachments and longings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiter L |title=Sexual orientation, sexual identity, and the question of choice |journal=Clinical Social Work Journal |volume=17 |pages=138–50 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;apahelp&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality |periodical=American Psychological Association|APAHelpCenter.org |accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as closeted.

''Sexual identity'' may also be used to describe a person's perception of his or her own ''sex'', rather than sexual orientation. The term ''sexual preference'' has a similar meaning to ''sexual orientation'', but is more commonly used outside of scientific circles by people who believe that sexual orientation is, in whole or part, a matter of choice.

Sexual orientation is a concept that evolved in the industrialized West and there is a controversy as to the universality of its application in other societies/ cultures. &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sFHX6uu19ZEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=sexual+orientation+is+a+western+concept&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lj2ODgARED&amp;sig=6AUpbyJbsvbyqUxbjKmnXfdZX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result The Psychology of Sexual Orientation, Behaviour, and identity] By Louis Diamant, Richard D.

McIntosh (1968) has previously noted that people who do not identify with the classic western, white gay/lesbian role may not necessarily identify their behaviour as homosexual.&lt;/ref&gt; As Michel Foucault put it, &quot;'Sexuality' is an invention of the modern state, the industrial revolution, and capitalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dMAtGvry_IMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=china+heterosexuality+love+western&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PKv2BfyPpd&amp;sig=s43w6PzlNOgefEsjpHViwrxkM6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Chinese Femininities, Chinese Masculinities: A Reader]; By Susan Brownell, Jeffrey N.

Sexual minorities (i.e., homosexuals, bisexuals, asexuals) are about twice as likely as heterosexuals to seek mental health help or substance abuse treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grella2009&quot;&gt;Grella, Christine, Lisa Greenwell, Vickie Mays, and Susan Cochran. 2009. “Influence of gender, sexual orientation, and need on treatment utilization for substance use and mental disorders: findings from the California quality of life survey.” BMC Psychiatry 9:52.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study,&lt;ref name=&quot;Grella2009&quot;/&gt; 48.5% of lesbian/gay/bisexual individuals reported receiving treatment in the past year as compared to 22.5% of heterosexuals. In another study of LGBT youth, 30% met the criteria for a mental health disorder, but 70% did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mustanski2010&quot;&gt;Mustanski, Brian S., Robert Garofalo, and Erin M. Emerson. 2010. “Mental Health Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Suicidality in a Diverse Sample of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youths.” Am J Public Health 100:2426-2432.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly 10% met the criteria for [[w:Post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and 15% met the criteria for major depression.  Additionally, 1/3 had attempted suicide at some point in their life.  While these rates are higher than for youths in national samples, they are comparable to youths in urban, racial, and ethnic minority samples.  The primary reason why it's believed sexual minorities are more likely to suffer mental health disorders and seek help at greater rates is due to the greater levels of stress they face resulting from discrimination they experience as a result of their sexual orientation. Acceptance of homosexuality has increased among Americans over the last 40 years to the point that the majority of Americans want some form of marital or civil union rights for homosexuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2006&quot;&gt;Goldberg, Michelle. 2006.

Close to 25% of lesbian and gay teens and about 15% of bisexual teens are homeless, compared with just 3% of heterosexual teens. Additionally, homeless LGB teens are more likely than heterosexual teens to be on their own rather than with a parent or guardian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corliss2011&quot;&gt;Corliss, Heather L., Carol S. Goodenow, Lauren Nichols, and S.

In California, partnership rates for lesbians are nearly the same as those for heterosexual women, but lower among gay men than among heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter2008&quot;&gt;Christopher Carpenter, and Gary J. Gates. 2008. “Gay and Lesbian Partnership: Evidence from California.” Demography 45:573-590.&lt;/ref&gt;  Homosexuals who are partnered tend to be older, are more likely to be white, and are better educated than are non-partnered gay men and lesbians.

There is no evidence to date that attempts to change someone's sexual orientation are successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2006&quot;/&gt;  What's more, there is some evidence to suggest that attempting to change sexual orientation can actually be quite harmful, increasing the risks for depression, anxiety, and self-destructive behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg2006&quot;/&gt;

==Sexual Abuse==
One form of sexual abuse, rape, is far more pervasive than many people realize.  A report prepared by researchers working for the United Nations looking at rape in Asia and the Pacific found that rape rates varied by country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulu2013&quot;&gt;Fulu, Emma et al. 2013. Why Do Some Men Use Violence against Women and How Can We Prevent It? Quantitative Findings from the United Nations Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asian and the Pacific. Bangkok: UNDP, UNFPA, Un Women, and UNV. Retrieved (http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/timor-leste/drive/p4p-report.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;  In Papua New Guinea, just under 60% of men had forced a woman to have sex, while just under 10% of men had done the same in Cambodia.  Overall, close to 1 in 4 men had forced a woman to have sex against her will.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulu2013&quot;/&gt;  Globally, 1 in 10 girls under the age of 20 are raped or sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNICEF2014&quot;&gt;Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence Against Children. Retrieved (http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Hidden_in_plain_sight_statistical_analysis_EN_3_Sept_2014.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

A factor shown to contribute to sexual abuse is the sexual objectification of individuals, which is when people are perceived primarily in a sexual fashion rather than as an individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gervais2013&quot;&gt;Gervais, Sarah J., Arianne M. Holland, and Michael D. Dodd. 2013. “My Eyes Are Up Here: The Nature of the Objectifying Gaze Toward Women.” Sex Roles 69(11-12):557–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent research has found that it is very common for women to be sexually objectified.  At least on college campuses it is true that women often experience others looking at their breasts rather than looking them in the eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gervais2013&quot;/&gt;  This is even more likely for women with larger breasts.  However, there is a surprising twist to this research: while men were likely to gaze at women's breasts, so, too, were women, though probably for different reasons.  Men were likely thinking about the women in a sexual fashion while women were probably making comparisons to themselves, which suggests that women can contribute, albeit indirectly, to their own sexual objectification by thinking of themselves as sexual objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gervais2013&quot;/&gt;

One of the factors that increases the risk of sexual abuse in men is having experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse.  Men who have experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse are 4 1/2 times more likely to engage in sexually coercive behavior than are men who were not abused as children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey2009&quot;&gt;Casey, Erin A., Blair Beadnell, and Taryn P. Lindhorst. 2009. “Predictors of Sexually Coercive Behavior in a Nationally Representative Sample of Adolescent Males.” J Interpers Violence 24:1129-1147.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, more than half of the men who engage in coercive sexual behavior have no history of childhood sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey2009&quot;/&gt;

==Introduction to deviance==
[[Image:Nose picking in progress.jpg|right|thumb|185px|Picking one's nose is an example of ''informal deviance'']]

'''Deviance''' is any behavior that violates cultural norms. Deviance is often divided into two types of deviant activities.  The first, crime is the violation of formally enacted laws and is referred to as ''formal deviance''.  Examples of formal deviance would include: robbery, theft, rape, murder, and assault, just to name a few.  The second type of deviant behavior refers to violations of informal social norms, norms that have not been codified into law, and is referred to as ''informal deviance''.  Examples of informal deviance might include: picking one's nose, belching loudly (in some cultures), or standing too close to another unnecessarily (again, in some cultures).  

As the last two examples in the preceding paragraph illustrate, deviance can vary quite dramatically from culture to culture.  Cultural norms are relative; this makes deviant behavior relative as well.  For instance, in general U.S. society it is uncommon for people to restrict their speech to certain hours of the day.  In the Christ Desert Monastery there are specific rules about when the residents can and cannot speak, including a specific ban on speaking between 7:30 pm and 4:00 am. The norms and rules of the Christ Desert Monastery are examples of how norms are relative to cultures. 

Current research on deviance by sociologists takes many forms.  For example, Dr. Karen Halnon of Pennsylvania State University studies how some people exercise informal deviance.  Her research focuses on what she calls &quot;deviance vacations,&quot; where people of certain socioeconomic status descend to lower strata.  For instance, heterosexual white males may become drag queens on the weekend.  It is a vacation because heterosexual white males can afford to descend temporarily and then return to the advantages of their true socioeconomic status.  Other examples include white hip-hop acts like Eminem and Nu-Metal bands like Limp Bizkit that represent for the lower or middle class people in order to use their socioeconomic credentials for profit, despite their true socioeconomic status.  

Sociological interest in deviance includes both interests in measuring formal deviance (statistics of criminal behavior; see below), examining how people (individually and collectively) define some things deviant and others normative, and a number of theories that try to explain both the role of deviance in society and its origins. This chapter will cover the theories of deviance used by sociologists and will also cover current crime statistics.

==Theories of Deviance== 
===Psychological Explanations===
While the focus of this chapter is on sociological explanations of deviance, there are explanations from other disciplines as well.  For instance, recent research in neurology and psychology finds that boys with conduct disorder have differences in their brain structure and that those differences exist during childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairchild2011&quot;&gt;Fairchild G, Passamonti L, Hurford G, Hagan CC, von dem Hagen EA, van Goozen SH, Goodyer IM, Calder AJ (2011), “Brain structure abnormalities in early-onset and adolescent-onset conduct disorder.” Am J Psychiatry 168(6):624-33&lt;/ref&gt; These differences likely contribute to their deviant behavior, but whether or not these differences exist before deviant activities is widely debated.

===Social-Strain Typology===
Robert K. Merton, in his discussion of deviance, proposed a typology of deviant behavior.  A typology is a classification scheme designed to facilitate understanding.  In this case, Merton was proposing a typology of deviance based upon two criteria: (1) a person's motivations or his or her adherence to cultural goals; (2) a person's belief in how to attain his or her goals.  These two criteria are shown in the diagram below.  According to Merton, there are five types of deviance based upon these criteria:

[[Image:Mertons social strain theory.svg|right|thumb|300px]]

*'''conformity''' involves the acceptance of the cultural goals and means of attaining those goals (e.g., a banker)
*'''innovation''' involves the acceptance of the goals of a culture but the rejection of the traditional and/or legitimate means of attaining those goals (e.g., a member of the Mafia or street gang values wealth but employs alternative means of attaining her wealth)
*'''ritualism''' involves the rejection of cultural goals but the routinized acceptance of the means for achieving the goals (e.g., a disillusioned bureaucrat - like Milton in the movie ''Office Space'', who goes to work everyday because it is what he does, but does not share the goal of the company of making lots of money)
*'''retreatism''' involves the rejection of both the cultural goals and the traditional means of achieving those goals (e.g., a homeless person who is homeless more by choice than by force or circumstance or a commune established separately from dominant social norms)
*'''rebellion''' is a special case wherein the individual rejects both the cultural goals and traditional means of achieving them but actively attempts to replace both elements of the society with different goals and means (e.g., a communist revolution and / or social movement activities)

What makes Merton's typology so fascinating is that people can turn to deviance in the pursuit of widely accepted social values and goals. For instance, individuals in the U.S. who sell illegal drugs have rejected the culturally acceptable means of making money, but still share the widely accepted cultural value in the U.S. of making money.  Thus, deviance can be the result of accepting one norm, but breaking another in order to pursue the first.

===Structural-Functionalism===
The structural-functionalist approach to deviance argues that deviant behavior plays an important role in society for several reasons. First, deviance helps distinguish between what is acceptable behavior, and what is not.  In a sense deviance is required in order for people to know what they can and cannot do.  It draws lines and demarcates boundaries. This is an important function as it affirms the cultural values and norms of a society for the members of that society. 

In addition to clarifying the moral boundaries of society, deviant behavior can also promote social unity, but it does so at the expense of the deviant individuals, who are obviously excluded from the sense of unity derived from differentiating the non-deviant from the deviants. 

Finally, and quite out of character for the structural-functionalist approach, deviance is actually seen as one means for society to change over time.  Deviant behavior can imbalance societal equilibrium.  In the process of returning societal equilibrium, society is often forced to change.  Thus, deviant behavior serves several important functions in society.

===Conflict Theory===
Deviance and criminal behavior can also be tied to power and resource imbalances in society.  Individuals may engage in deviant or criminal behavior because they lack the physical resources necessary to survive, committing property crimes like thefts or selling drugs in order to procure such resources.  The criminal justice system is also structured to reflect differences in power and property, as white collar crime illustrates.

A clear example of how deviance reflects power imbalances is in the reporting and tracking of crimes.  ''White-collar'' crimes are typically committed by individuals in higher social classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Velez2003&quot;&gt;Velez, Maria B., Lauren J. Krivo, and Ruth D. Peterson. 2003. “Structural Inequality and Homicide: An Assessment of Black-White Gap in Killings.” Criminology 41:645-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;&gt;http://web.archive.org/20040811015632/www.fbi.gov/publications/strategicplan/stategicplantext.htm#whitecollar&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of white-collar crimes include&lt;ref&gt;http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/topics/white_collar.html&lt;/ref&gt;:
*antitrust violations
*computer, credit card, phone, telemarketing, bankruptcy, healthcare, insurance, mail, and government fraud
*tax evasion
*insider trading
*bribery and public corruption
*counterfeiting
*money laundering
*embezzlement
*economic espionage
*trade secret theft

As of 2009, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics do not provide clear statistics on white-collar crime, like they do with other types of crime.  Most of the statistics provided are estimates of losses resulting from white-collar crime, which include: 
*unclear amount of money lost from corporate crime, but totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*at least $50 billion lost every year in the U.S. from health care fraud&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*unclear amount of money lost from financial institution fraud, but totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*unclear amount of money lost from money laundering, but also totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*at least 10% of government funds for domestic programs may be lost to fraud every year, totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;
*unclear amount of money lost from insurance, telemarketing, and investment fraud every year, but also totalling in the billions&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI2009&quot;/&gt;

That such crimes are not tracked more clearly suggests that there is less of an emphasis placed on prosecuting white collar crime than there is on prosecuting other types of crime (property and violent crime) in the U.S.  It may also be the case that it is difficult to collect such statistics, but that is also likely due to the fact that a system for tracking such crimes has not been put into place because such crimes are not seen as warranting the same amount of attention as exists for other types of crimes.

That white-collar crimes are less likely to be tracked, less likely to be reported, less likely to be prosecuted, and are more likely to be committed by people in higher social classes suggests that the way crimes are punished in the U.S. tends to favor the affluent while punitively punishing the less affluent.  Additionally, men benefit more from white-collar crime than do women, as they are more likely to attempt these crimes when they are in more powerful positions, allowing them to reap greater rewards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daly1989&quot;&gt;Daly, Kathleen. 1989. “Gender and Varieties of White-Collar Crime.” Criminology 27:769-794.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another illustration of how criminal behavior is tied to inequality and power is in the oft-stated motivation for committing property crimes - a lack of money and resources.  Many individuals who commit property crimes do so because they are in need of money.  Additionally, many of those individuals, and many people who are less affluent, lack education in how to manage money and finances, which can result in a cycle of poverty and crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Call2013&quot;&gt;Call, Lindsay Larson, W. Justin Dyer, Angela R. Wiley, and Randal D. Day. 2013. “Inmate Perceptions of Financial Education Needs: Suggestions for Financial Educators.” Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning 24(1):45–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling Theory===
'''Labeling Theory''' refers to the idea that individuals become deviant when two things occur: 
#a deviant label is applied to them (e.g., ''loner'', ''punk'')
#they adopt the label by exhibiting the behaviors, actions, and attitudes associated with the label
This approach to deviance recognizes its cultural relativity and is aware that deviance can result from power imbalances.  But it takes the idea of deviance further by illustrating how a deviant [[w:identity|identity]] develops through the application and adoption of labels.  Labeling theory argues that people become deviant as a result of people forcing that identity upon them and then adopting the identity.  

Labels are understood to be the names associated with identities or role-sets in society.  Examples of more innocuous labels might include ''father'' or ''lover''.  Deviant labels refer to identities that are known for falling outside of cultural norms, like ''loner'' or ''punk''.

There are two additional ideas related to the labeling theory approach to understanding deviance.  First, once a deviant identity is adopted, it is often the case that the past behaviors of the now deviant individual are re-interpreted in light of the new identity.  The process of re-casting one's past actions in light of a current identity is referred to as ''retrospective labeling''.  A very clear example of retrospective labeling can be seen in how the perpetrators of the [[w:Columbine High School massacre|Columbine High School massacre]], [[w:Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], were re-cast after the incident took place.  Much of their behavior leading up to the school shootings has been re-interpreted in light of the deviant identity with which they were labeled as a result of the shootings.

Another important element of labeling theory involves the idea of ''stigma''.  Stigma refers to the situation of the individual who is disqualified from full social acceptance because of some mark of infamy or disgrace or a label that is often difficult to hide or disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goffman1963&quot;&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stigma extend the idea of labeling theory by illustrating how individual characteristics can be the basis for attaching labels that can be life-altering.  A good example of a stigma that is now increasingly difficult to hide is the publishing of convicted sex offender identities and information on websites ([http://www.hcso.org/PublicServices/SexOffenders/offender.asp see here for an example]).  The stigma is the past behavior - the sex offense - but this identity is relatively easily hidden as it impossible to pick a sex offender out of a crowd.  By pushing the sex offender identity into public purview, sex offenders, regardless of current behavior, are stigmatized; they are stuck with a deviant identity that overwhelms any other identity they may have.  In sum, labeling theory argues that the application of labels (role-sets) to individuals is an important element leading to deviant behavior.

==Crime Statistics==
Crime statistics are usually data collected by governments for the reporting of incidents of criminal activity.  They are useful for a number of reasons, beyond simply giving an awareness of the extent of criminal activity.  Presented below are statistics on criminal activity and the criminal justice system for both the U.S. and selected nations around the world (for comparisons).  The statistics included in this section were chosen to provide a sampling of how crime statistics can be useful beyond simply reporting incidents of criminal behavior.

It is important to understand that crime statistics do not provide a perfect view of crime. Government statistics on crime only show data for crimes that have been reported to authorities. These crimes represent only a fraction of those crimes that have been acted upon by law enforcement, which in turn represents only a fraction of those crimes where people have made complaints to the police, which in turn represents only a fraction of the total crimes committed.  However, it should also be noted that television presents an unrealistic picture of the frequency of crime, particularly violent crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sparks2009&quot;&gt;Sparks, Glenn and Susan Huelsing Sarapin. October 2009. The CSI Effect: The Relationship Between Exposure to TV Crime Dramas and Perceptions of the Criminal Justice System. Paper presented at the International Crime, Media &amp; Popular Culture Studies Conference. Indian State University, Terre Haute, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavy viewers of crime dramas on TV (e.g., [[w:CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation|CSI]], [[w:Law &amp; Order|Law &amp; Order]], etc.) estimate that there are 2 1/2 times as many real world deaths due to murder than do non-viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sparks2009&quot;/&gt;  Thus, while crimes are under-reported, they do tend to receive disproportionate attention in the media, leading people to think that crime is more prevalent than it actually is.

===Incarceration Rates and Populations===
One of the more interesting features of the U.S. is the extensive number of people who are currently in the correctional system.  One explanation for this is the increasingly punitive approach of the criminal justice system. According to Western (2007)&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;/&gt;, those who break laws in the U.S. today are twice as likely to be imprisoned as criminals a generation ago.  While debated, the percentage of prison inmates who have been wrongly convicted of crimes is estimated to be somewhere between less than 1% all the way up to 9%, which could mean hundreds of thousands of prison inmates are actually innocent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liptak2008&quot;&gt;Liptak, Adam. 2008. “Consensus on Counting the Innocent: We Can’t.” The New York Times, March 25 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/us/25bar.html (Accessed March 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure below breaks down the correctional system population by the status of individuals in the correctional system, including:

*prison
*probation
*jail
*parole

[[Image:Adult Corrections Populations by Status - 1980-2012.png|center|thumb|800px|Adult Correctional Population in the U.S.]]

While the population of the United States is the third largest in the world (behind China and India), the percentage of the population that is in prison is the highest in the world, as illustrated by the map below.

[[File:Prisoner population rate world map.svg|center|thumb|800px|Map 1. Source: http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf]]

This map illustrates that the U.S. has both a lot of people in prison in sheer numbers but also as a percentage of the population. Comparing incarceration rates by countries goes beyond just reporting incidents of criminal activity (incidents of crime are not much higher in the U.S. than elsewhere) by highlighting differences in the correctional systems of countries.  Countries differ in the restrictiveness of their laws and prison sentences.  Differences of these types are seen when comparing incarceration rates and populations.

[[Image:Recidivism rate by crime - 2005-2010.png|center|thumb|800px|Recidivism rates in the U.S.]]

The U.S. has a relatively high [[w:recidivism|recidivism]] rate (recidivism refers to the frequency of repeat offenses).  More than half (some estimate around 67%) of prison inmates will be convicted on another charge within three years of having been released and return to prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;  This statistic is revealing of the nature of the prison system in the U.S.: it is more interested in keeping people who commit crimes away from the rest of the population than it is in attempting to reform or resocialize individuals to make them productive members of society.  One factor that contributes to the high recidivism rates is the social [[w:stigma|stigma]] that accompanies having been convicted of a [[w:felony|felony]] in the US. van Olphen et al. (2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;vanOlphen2009&quot;&gt;van Olphen, Juliana, Michele Eliason, Nicholas Freudenberg, and Marilyn Barnes. 2009. “Nowhere to go: How stigma limits the options of female drug users after release from jail.” Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 4:10.&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals convicted of drug offenses were very likely to be reincarcerated, largely due to punitive punishments that accompanied their &quot;convicted felon&quot; stigma.  For instance, they were often denied access to public housing and food stamps, which led many of the participants in the study to sell drugs to survive, leading to future arrests and convictions.  The lack of help given to convicts released from prison increases the odds of those convicts returning to prison.  Another factor that significantly increases the odds of convicts returning to prison is their return to their former neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk2009&quot;&gt;Kirk, David S. 2009. A Natural Experiment on Residential Change and Recidivism: Lessons from Hurricane Katrina. American Sociological Review. 74(3):484-500.&lt;/ref&gt;  Convicts who move away from their old neighborhood are substantially less likely to commit another crime; distancing themselves from the social environment that encouraged their criminal activity in the first place reduces their odds of reincarceration. Finally, the stigma associated with spending time in prison leads to substantially worse physical and mental health for ex-cons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Massoglia2009&quot;&gt;massoglia, michael, and jason schnittker. 2009. “no real RELEASE.” Contexts 8:38-42.&lt;/ref&gt; including higher rates of chronic illness, disability, psychiatric disorders, major depression, and anxiety.

A relatively recent innovation in criminal justice that has been shown to moderately reduce recidivism rates is &quot;drug courts,&quot; or alternative sentencing systems that mandate treatment and therapy rather than jail time for drug offenses.  Drug courts appear to reduce recidivism by somewhere between 8 and 10 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2008&quot;&gt;Eckholm, Erik. 2008. “Courts Give Addicts a Chance to Straighten Out.” The New York Times, October 15 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/us/15drugs.html (Accessed February 19, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  That drug courts reduce recidivism is not all that surprising consider there is an actual intent to modify behavior rather than simply removing individuals from society.

[[Image:Government expenditures on police judicial and corrections 1982-2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

Another interesting characteristic of the U.S. is the amount of money that is spent on the correctional system.  Policing the nations streets is the most expensive component of the correctional system, followed by housing prison inmates.  The average annual cost for one federal prisoner exceeds $20,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;  The judicial process is the least expensive, but the combined expenses of all three elements total over $200 billion annually (when you combine state, local, and federal expenditures).&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;&gt;Silver, Howard. 2008. “The Costs of Mass Incarceration Examined by Congressional Panel.” Footnotes, February 2008, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though billions of dollars are spent on the criminal justice system every year in the U.S., the financial outlays actually account for only part of the cost of mass incarceration.  Millions of additional jobs and even lives are lost as a result of the stigma that follows prison inmates when released (which also explains the high recidivism rate).  Convicted felons are barred from working in certain industries, have limited access to educational opportunities, and have limited access to welfare and housing benefits from the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;  All of these problems combine to concentrate former inmates in poor urban neighborhoods that have limited opportunities to move out of criminal circles.  Reducing the consequences of felony convictions and providing occupational and drug counseling would go a long way toward alleviating the high recidivism rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silver2008&quot;/&gt;

===Gender===
Another way crime statistics can go beyond simply reporting incidents of criminal activity is in highlighting differences between different groups.  One difference in criminal activity is seen in the number of violent crimes committed by gender; men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women.

Another telling crime statistic that is traditionally seen as highlighting power imbalances is the number of rapes in society.  While the focus of this chapter is not on exploring the motivations behind rape, the number of rapes in the U.S. and internationally can be seen to reflect power imbalances between men and women as men are far more likely to rape women than vice versa. The figures below show that rape rates in the U.S. have declined in recent years and also compare rape rates from select countries around the world.

[[Image:Rapes per 1000 by sex 1995-2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

[[Image:Rape rates for select countries -2012.png|center|thumb|800px]]

===Race===
Regardless of one's views on the [[w:War on Drugs|War on Drugs]] in the U.S., one thing is certain, the war disproportionately targets African Americans. Since the inception of the war on drugs in 1980, millions of drug related arrests have been made.  African Americans are no more likely to use drugs than are whites,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2008&quot;&gt;Eckholm, Erik. 2008. “Reports Find Racial Gap in Drug Arrests.” The New York Times, May 6 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06disparities.html (Accessed February 3, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; but between 1980 and 2003, the arrest rates for African Americans for drug offenses rose at three times the rate as it did for whites, 225% vs. 70%.&lt;ref name=&quot;King2008&quot;&gt;King, Ryan S. 2008. Disparity by Geography: The War on Drugs in America's Cities. The Sentencing Project. Washington. D.C. http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/dp_drugarrestreport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason: drug use and trafficking in the inner-city as opposed to suburbs has been the focus of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;King2008&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, penalties for using drugs that are more often found among minorities have traditionally been harsher than for drugs used by whites.  Crack and powder cocaine are very similar in effect, but possession of crack cocaine carries harsher penalties and is more likely to be used by blacks, who account for nearly 80% of crack convictions, than whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2010&quot;&gt;Eckholm, Erik. 2010. “Congress Moves to Narrow Sentencing Disparities for Crack and Powdered Cocaine.” The New York Times, July 28 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/us/politics/29crack.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss (Accessed August 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  These laws were enacted in 1986 and mandated minimum sentencing - 5 years for possessing five grams of crack; 10 years for 10 grams.  But the thresholds for powdered cocaine were 100 times as high - 500 grams of powdered cocaine got you just 5 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckholm2010&quot;/&gt;  The discriminatory prosecution of African Americans for drug offenses is just one way in which the criminal justice system in the U.S. works against African American equality.

The criminal justice system in the U.S. has a significant impact on the life chances of racial and ethnic minorities, in particular, people of African descent. Serving time in prison has become a normative event for young, lower-class African-American males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;&gt;Western, Bruce. 2007. Punishment and Inequality in America. Russell Sage Foundation Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The average African-American, male, high-school dropout born in the 1960s in the U.S. had a nearly 60% chance of serving time in prison by the end of the 1990s. (This probability drops precipitously for college-educated African-Americans.) A disproportionate percentage of African-Americans are in prison; African-Americans make up 12% of the U.S. population but nearly 46% of prison inmates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;/&gt; States with larger African-American populations tend to incarcerate more people, have more punitive policies toward juvenile offenders, and have worse conditions of confinement as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neill2014&quot;&gt;Neill, K. A., J. E. Yusuf, and J. C. Morris. 2014. “Explaining Dimensions of State-Level Punitiveness in the United States: The Roles of Social, Economic, and Cultural Factors.” Criminal Justice Policy Review.&lt;/ref&gt;  The long-lasting effects of criminal conviction and imprisonment (convicted felons are barred from many jobs), results in the disenfranchisement of many African-Americans - time spent in prison is time spent away from education and on-the-job training. As a result, many African-Americans end up unskilled and with criminal convictions and felony records. Additionally, many African Americans are disenfranchised as a result of their unequal treatment by the criminal justice system.  About 2.5% of Americans are not allowed to vote because of felon disenfranchisement, but 7.7% of African Americans cannot vote because of felon disenfranchisement (in Florida, it's 23.3% of African Americans).&lt;ref name=&quot;Neill2014&quot;/&gt;

Some scholars argue that the disproportionate imprisonment of African-Americans in the U.S. actually countermands the achievements of the civil rights movement. The criminal justice system in the U.S. is arguably a massive machine that results in the production of racial inequality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Western2007&quot;/&gt;  In fact, the inequality in the prison system is unmatched by that in other elements of society, as the following ratios indicate:
* ratio of African-American unemployment to European-American unemployment - 2 to 1
* ratio of African-Americans born to unwed mothers compared to European-American children born to unwed mothers - 3 to 1
* ratio of African-American infants who die compared to European-American infants who die - 2 to 1
* ratio of African-American to European-American wealth - 1 to 5
* ratio of African-American incarceration rate to European-American incarceration rate - 8 to 1

Another result of the disproportionate imprisonment of African-Americans in the U.S. is that imprisoned African-Americans are not included in calculations of unemployment rates. African-American are substantially more likely to be unemployed than European-American, but most statistics do not include prison populations.  

Another illustration of the disparity in punishment in the US based on race is tied to the death penalty.  Only 10% of individuals in the US sentenced to death are ever actually executed, but which ones are executed is intimately tied to race.  Individuals convicted of killing a European-American are five times more likely to be executed than individuals who killed a racial or ethnic minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs2007&quot;&gt;Jacobs, David; Qian, Zhenchao; Carmichael, Jason T. and Kent, Stephanie L. 2007. Who Survives on Death Row? An Individual and Contextual Analysis. American Sociological Review. 72:4, 610-632.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the criminal justice system in the US values white victims above minority victims.

All of these elements combined lead to the conclusion that one of the most racially disparate elements of U.S. society is the criminal justice system.

===Homicide===
The chart below tracks homicide rates in the U.S. for the past 100 years.  There has been an increase over time, though it is not clear whether that increase represents an actual increase in homicides or an increase in confounding factors, such as: stricter law enforcement, an increased willingness to report crimes, or changes in the definition of homicide itself.

[[Image:Homicide rates 1960-2011.png|center|thumb|800px]]

The U.S. does not have the highest homicide rates in the world, but the rates in the U.S. are still relatively high compared to other countries (see chart).

[[Image:Homicide rates for select countries 2012.png|center|thumb|800px]]

Homicide rates also vary by the age of the victim, as shown in the chart below.

[[Image:Homicide rates for males by age and race of victim.png|center|thumb|800px|Homicide rates by age group, 1970-2002.]]

Homicide rates vary substantially around the world.  A new, interactive website, [http://homicide.igarape.org.br/ Homicide Monitor], provides detailed statistics on homicide rates for dozens of countries around the world.

===High Crime Neighborhoods===
Traditionally people have thought of crime being the result of negative characteristics of a neighborhood (e.g., low incomes, high residential turnover rates, etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hipp2010&quot;/&gt;  However, there is some evidence to suggest that crime and the negative characteristics that were believed to cause high crime reinforce each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hipp2010&quot;&gt;Hipp, John R. 2010. “A Dynamic View of Neighborhoods: The Reciprocal Relationship between Crime and Neighborhood Structural Characteristics.” Social Problems 57:205-230.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research finds that higher crime rates actually leads to more concentrated poverty, declining retail presence, and more residential turnover.  This findings suggests that it is crime that drives away businesses and residents who have more money to safer areas, which then concentrates poverty and crime in that area.

==Social Control==
'''Social control''' refers to the various means used by a society to bring its  members back into line with cultural norms. There are two general types of social control:
*''formal social control'' refers to components of society that are designed for the resocialization of individuals who break formal rules; examples would include prisons and mental health institutions
*''informal social control'' refers to elements of society that are designed to reinforce informal cultural norms; examples might include parental reminders to children not to pick their nose.

Some researchers have outlined some of the motivations underlying the formal social control system.  These motivations include:
*''retribution'' - some argue that people should pay for the crime they committed
*''deterrence'' - some argue that punishments, e.g., prison time, will prevent people from committing future crimes
*''rehabilitation'' - some argue that formal social controls should work to rehabilitate criminals, eventually turning them into productive members of society
*''societal protection'' - finally, some argue that the motivation for formal social controls is nothing more than removing the deviant members of society from the non-deviant members

==Current Research==
===Video Games and Deviance===
Another area of current research that is of great interest to many people is the alleged effects of violent video games on behavior. Karen Sternheimer&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternheimer2007&quot;&gt;Sternheimer, Karen. 2007. &quot;Do video games kill?.&quot; Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:13-17.&lt;/ref&gt; explains that a lot of the concern around video games is illustrative of the social construction of deviance.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Goode and Nachman Ben-Yehuda. Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance (Blackwell, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Sternheimer, &quot;Politicians and other moral crusaders frequently create &quot;folk devils,&quot; individuals or groups defined as evil and immoral.  Folk devils allow us to channel our blame and fear, offering a clear course of action to remedy what many believe to be a growing problem.  Video games, those who play them, and those who create them have become contemporary folk devils because they seem to pose a threat to children.&quot; (p. 13)  The assumption is that playing violent video games will lead children to act out violently.  However, there is a growing body of literature that is either inconclusive on this issue or that contradicts this assumption: it does not appear as though playing violent video games results in violent behavior.

The reason why the assumption that playing violent video games is not accurate is because it decontextualizes violence.  Those who claim violent video games lead to violence fail to realize that violence is context dependent and most players of video games are fully aware of this.  Individuals who play video games recognize that violence in the context of the game is okay and that it is not okay to be violent outside of that context.  Additionally, many of the studies that have claimed to have found a connection between playing video games and violent behavior have failed to control for other influences on violent individuals, influences that are more likely to translate into violent behavior: neighborhood violence and instability, family violence, and even mental illness.  Seldom is a connection made between adult shooting sprees in the workplace (which are far more common than school shooting sprees)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternheimer2007&quot;/&gt; and video games. Instead, people look toward contextual influences like those described above (i.e., job loss, family problems, etc.).  In other words, violent video games are the folk devils for violent behavior in children, but not for adults.

Finally, the video game explanation is also illustrative of social-conflict and racial discrimination.  Seldom is the explanation of a black violent offender's behavior playing violent video games.  The assumption is that black culture encourages violence; as a result, violent behavior by young black men is not &quot;shocking,&quot; so it does not require a folk devil to explain it.  This is, of course, discriminatory.  In contrast, it is generally white, middle-class violent offenders whose behavior is explained by alleging a video game connection.  The fact that these violent offenders are white and middle class threatens the &quot;innocence and safety of suburban America,&quot; (p. 17)&lt;ref name=&quot;Sternheimer2007&quot;/&gt; which means it requires a folk devil culprit, absolving white, middle-class America of the blame.

===Tattoos===
One area of current research into deviance that highlights the socially constructed nature of norms is tattoos. In 2003 a survey found that 15% of the U.S. adult population had at least one tattoo; that number jumps to 28% for adults under 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang2007&quot;&gt;Kang, Miliann, and Katherine Jones. 2007. “Why Do People Get Tattoos?.” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:42-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, tattoos are a very complicated illustration of the intricacies of deviance.  Many of the individuals getting tattoos do not fit the stereotypes of individuals who get tattoos (e.g., soldiers, sailors, bikers, etc.); many of those tattooing their bodies are high-achieving students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang2007&quot;/&gt; Additionally, tattooing is on the rise among women - 15% of women have tattoos while 16% of men do. Intriguingly, men and women get tattoos for different reasons.  For men it is to reinforce their masculinity and for women it is to enhance their femininity.  This differences illustrates another way in which gender is an action.

Another interesting aspect of tattoos is their changing meanings.  While it is probably not the case that the meaning (think symbolic interactionism) of tattoos to those who get them is changing (tattoos have traditionally been used to express one's self or commemorate events), how tattoos are viewed is changing.  In the early 1900s tattoos were so stigmatized that they could literally result in prosecution and served as evidence of ill intent and disrepute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kang2007&quot;/&gt;  Such extreme stigmatization is no longer the cause, probably because 88% of Americans know someone with a tattoo.  As a result, tattoos are decreasingly seen as deviant.  But tattoos also illustrate that deviance is not determined by the action but by those perceiving the action.  While a tattoo may mean one thing to the person with the tattoo, it is still the case that others interpret the tattoo in a multitude of ways, and those don't always align with the intended meanings.  Still today, tattoos are often equated with: drug use, troublemakers, and gang affiliation. This is probably why many people who get tattoos get them in locations that can easily be covered in regular business attire - that way they can still pass when not in the company of those who are more understanding of their tattoos.  Tattoos, then, illustrate the sociological understanding of deviance quite well.

===Sexual Violence on College Campuses===
There has been a great deal of attention concerning sexual violence on college campuses in recent years.  The US Federal government has raised concerns about this issue and various reports have found that colleges and universities are not addressing sexual violence as they should.[http://www.mccaskill.senate.gov/SurveyReportwithAppendix.pdf] For instance, many universities fail to investigate allegations of sexual assaults, they fail to encourage victims to report sexual assaults, they fail to provide adequate sexual assault training, and there are inadequate resources for the survivors of sexual assault.  The figure below suggests that sexual assaults are relatively rare on college campuses.  However, fewer than 5% of people raped on college campuses report their sexual assault to law enforcement, which suggests the numbers in the figure may be substantially higher than the figure reports.  Further, official figures like the one below limit their reporting to &quot;forcible sexual assault&quot; despite mounting evidence that the vast majority of sexual assaults on college campuses do not fit this narrow definition, and typically involve more subtle forms of sexual violence and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Corrigan.  2013.  Up Against a Wall: Rape Reform and the Failure of Success.  NYU Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heather R. Hlavka.  2014.  Normalizing Sexual Violence Young Women Account for Harassment and Abuse.  Gender &amp; Society 28(3): 337-358.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, in-depth analyses of sexual violence on college campuses generally reveals that sexual assault has become a normal aspect of college experience, culture, and structure for many American women, that on average 1 in 5 college women will be sexually victimized in some way during their college careers, and that common forms of college leisure activity, such as Greek, Party, and  Drinking cultures and habits on campuses, often facilitate the normalization of college sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Hamilton &amp; Elizabeth A. Armstrong.  2009.  Gendered Sexuality in Young Adulthood Double Binds and Flawed Options.  Gender &amp; Society 23(5): 589-616.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELIZABETH A. ARMSTRONG, LAURA HAMILTON, and BRIAN SWEENEY.  2006.  Sexual Assault on Campus: A Multilevel, Integrative Approach to Party Rape.  Social Problems 53(4): 483-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion Questions==
* Can you think of something you've done that would be deviant in one situation but not in another?
* Is everything that is illegal deviant?
* Is everything that is deviant illegal?
* Can you measure how deviant something is?

| In Bulgaria and Guam, I am considered simply as “other.” However, in Australia, I am labeled more specifically as “non-aboriginal other.” In Canada, it is somewhat more complex; I am labeled as “non-aboriginal Southeast Asian who is not a member of an Indian Band or First Nation or a Treaty Indian or Registered Indian as defined by the Indian Act of Canada.” In Mexico, my non-aboriginal background is once again emphasized simply as “non-indigenous.” In Brazil, I am categorized not by my origins, but by my skin tone as “yellow.” Across the Atlantic, I am categorized as “any other Asian background” in England and as “Indian or Asian” in South Africa. In the United States today, recent attempts to be more specific have resulted in giving me the opportunity to indicate that I am a “non-Hispanic Chinese Vietnamese” person. However, in the United States in the past, I would have been forced to exclusively identify as “Chinese” from 1890 to 1970 and “Vietnamese” from 1980 to 1990.

These preceding statements are responses to actual census questions on race and ethnicity from different countries around the globe as well as across time in the United States. Why is there so much variation in my racial and ethnic identity if, in fact, race and ethnicity are assumed to be “natural” and “absolute”? The mutability of my racial and ethnic identity over time and space illustrates that race and ethnicity are very much socially-constructed concepts, and that the racial and ethnic options afforded to me are dependent on the circumstances of a particular society at a particular point in time. What about the options for my son who is mixed-race? Will his identity as half-Asian take precedence over his half-white identity in the U.S. given the legacy of the “one-drop rule,” in which the minority status will always take precedence? Take for example, President Barack Obama, who is similar to my son in that he is mixed-race. However, more often than not, President Obama is identified in public discourse simply as black. Likewise, Tiger Woods, who self-identifies as “Cablinasian” in attempt to be recognized as Caucasian, Black, Indian, and Asian by others, is still nonetheless simply labeled as black in mainstream media despite his multi-racial background.

The complexity of my identity, in addition to my son’s, Obama’s, and Woods’ identities, exemplifies the need to move beyond mutually-exclusive and inflexible interpretations of race and ethnicity, especially considering that interracial marriages are observably on the rise in the United States. This chapter on race and ethnicity first illustrates the social construction of these two highly-contested concepts, and then discusses the many pitfalls, such as prejudice and discrimination, associated with them.

==Race and Ethnicity==
A '''race''' is a human population that is believed to be distinct in some way from other humans based on real or imagined ''physical'' differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, Luca; Menozzi, Paolo; and Piazza, Alberto. 1996. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton University Press. Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Racial classifications are rooted in the idea of biological classification of humans according to morphological features such as skin color or facial characteristics. An individual is usually externally classified (meaning someone else makes the classification) into a racial group rather than the individual choosing where they belong as part of their identity. Conceptions of race, as well as specific racial groupings, are often [[w:controversial issue|controversial]] due to their impact on [[w:social identity|social identity]] and how those identities influence someone's position in social hierarchies (see [[w:identity politics|identity politics]]). 

Ethnicity, while related to race, refers not to physical characteristics but social traits that are shared by a human population.  Some of the social traits often used for ethnic classification include:
*nationality
*tribe
*religious faith
*shared language
*shared culture
*shared traditions

Unlike race, ethnicity is not usually externally assigned by other individuals. The term ethnicity focuses more upon a group's connection to a perceived shared past and culture.  An example of an ethnic group in the U.S. is [[w:Hispanic|Hispanic]] or [[w:Latino|Latino]].

==The Changing Definitions of Race==
The division of humanity into distinct ''races'' can be traced as far back as the Ancient Egyptian sacred text the [[w:Book of Gates|Book of Gates]], which identified four races according to the Egyptians. This early treatment merged racial and ethnic differences, combining skin-color with tribal and national identities. Ancient Greek and Roman authors also attempted to explain and categorize visible biological differences between peoples known to them. [[w:Medieval|Medieval]] models of race mixed Classical ideas with the notion that humanity as a whole was descended from Shem, Ham and Japheth, the three [[w:sons of Noah|sons of Noah]], producing distinct [[w:Semitic|Semitic]], (Asian), [[w:Hamitic|Hamitic]] (African), and [[w:Japhetic|Japhetic]] (European) peoples. The first scientific attempts to categorize race date from the 17th century; these early attempts developed along with European imperialism and colonisation around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt;

In the 19th century a number of natural scientists wrote on race: [[w:Georges Cuvier|Georges Cuvier]], [[w:James Cowles Pritchard|James Cowles Pritchard]], [[w:Louis Agassiz|Louis Agassiz]], [[w:Charles Pickering NMI|Charles Pickering]], and [[w:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]].  These scientists made three claims about race: 
#races are objective, naturally occurring divisions of humanity
#there is a strong relationship between biological races and other human phenomena (such as social behavior and culture, and by extension the relative material success of cultures)
#race is therefore a valid scientific category that can be used to explain and predict individual and group behavior  
Races were distinguished by [[w:human skin color|skin color]], facial type, cranial profile and size, and texture and color of hair. Races were almost universally considered to reflect group differences in moral character and intelligence.

These early understandings of race were usually both [[w:essentialism|essentialist]] and [[w:taxonomic|taxonomic]]; essentialism refers to unchanging and inherent characteristics of individuals and taxonomic refers to classificatory (also usually hierarchical) in nature.  The advent of [[w:Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] models of [[w:evolution|evolution]] and [[w:Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[w:genetics|genetics]], however, called into question the scientific validity of both characteristics and required a radical reconsideration of race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt; 

The table below illustrates both how early definitions included essentialist and taxonomic elements and how definitions have changed over time.

Because racial differences continue to be important issues in social and political life, racial classifications continue.  The United States government has attempted its own definitions of race and ethnicity (see for example [[w:Race (U.S. Census)|U.S. Census]]) for such classifications and comparisons.

==Social Construct or Biological Lineage?==
===Social Construction===
Debates continue in and among academic disciplines as to how race should be understood. Some sociologists and biologists believe race is a [[w:social construction|social construct]], meaning it does not have a basis in the natural world but is simply an artificial distinction created by humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt;  As a result of this understanding, some researchers have turned from conceptualizing and analyzing human variation by race to doing so in terms of [[w:population genetics|populations]], dismissing racial classifications altogether. In the face of the increasing rejection of race as a valid classification scheme, many social scientists have replaced the word ''race'' with the word ''[[w:Ethnic group|ethnicity]]'' to refer to self-identifying groups based on  shared religion, nationality, or culture.

The understanding of race as a social construct is well-illustrated by examining race issues in two countries, the U.S. and Brazil.

====Constructing Race in the U.S.====
Since the early days of the United States, racial classifications have varied and various groups, like Native Americans, African-Americans and European-Americans, were classified as belonging to different races.  The table below details some of the different racial and ethnic classifications that have been used by the US Census.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Census Bureau 2015&quot;&gt;The US Census Bureau recently released an interactive chart illustrating changes in racial classifications over time. The chart is available here: http://www.census.gov/population/race/data/MREAD_1790_2010.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that these classifications have changed over time illustrates that race is socially constructed.

The criteria for membership in different races have been very different.  For Africans, the government considered anyone with African appearance to be purely African.  Native Americans, on the other hand, were classified based on a certain percentage of ''Indian blood''.  Finally, European-Americans had to have purely white ancestry.  The differing criteria for assigning  membership to particular races had relatively little to do with biology; it had far more to do with maintaining a group's defined roles and position.  

[[Image:Racial makeup of the US 2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

Some researchers and historians have proposed that the intent of the differing criteria for racial designations was to concentrate power, wealth, privilege, and land in the hands of European-Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fields1990&quot;&gt;Fields, Barbara Jean. 1990. Slavery, Race, and Ideology in the United States of America. New Left Review 181:95-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sider1993&quot;&gt;Sider, Gerald. 1993. Lumbee Indian Histories: Race, Ethnicity, and Indian Identity in the Southern United States.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the offspring of an African slave and European master or mistress would be considered an African.  Significant in terms of the economics of slavery, the mixed-race child of a slave mother also would be a slave, adding to the wealth of the slaveowner.  

Contrast the African criteria with that of Native Americans; a person of Native American and African parentage automatically was classified as African.   But the offspring of only a few generations of Native Americans and Europeans were not considered Indian at all - at least not in a legal sense.  Native Americans had treaty rights to land, but individuals with only one Indian great-grandparent were no longer classified as Native American, disenfranchising them from their claims to Native American lands.  Of course, the same individuals who could be denied legal claim to Native American lands because they were ''too White'', were still Native American enough to be considered ''half-breeds and were stigmatized as a result.  

In an economy benefitting from slave labor, it was useful to have as many African slaves as possible.  Conversely, in a nation bent on westward expansion (commonly referred to as illegal immigration and / or ethnic conquest today), it was advantageous to diminish the numbers of those who could claim title to Indian lands by classifying them out of existence.  Both schemes benefitted the third group, the ''racially pure'' whites.  The point being, of course, that the classifications of race in the early U.S. were socially constructed in a fashion that benefitted one ''race'' over the others.

The earliest blacks in the U.S. were brought from Africa as [[w:slaves|slaves]] primarily to help in agricultural in the southern U.S.  Although European immigrants to the Americas initially attempted to enslave Native people, their efforts were often subverted due to Native understandings of the land.  As a result, slave labor from other parts of the world was deemed more efficient for the production of American land so European immigrants began importing African people while exporting Natives to other parts of the Americas (see [[w: Lies my teacher told me|Loewen's work for more of this historical record]]).  While migration since then has substantially altered the distribution of African Americans in the U.S., African Americans remain concentrated in the southern U.S., as depicted in the map below.

[[File:Percentage of state populations identifying as black 2012.svg|center|thumb|600px]]

Native Americans in the U.S. are concentrated on [[w:Indian reservation|reservations]] following 200 years of relocation policies instituted by the U.S. government (see the documentary film  [[w: Broken Rainbow (film)|Broken Rainbow]] for review and detailed examination of the latest relocation phase in the 1970's), as depicted in the map below:

====Constructing Race in Brazil====
[[File:Race in brazil 2006.png|thumb|400px|right]]
The [[w:IBGE|Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] classifies the Brazilian population in five categories: white, black, [[w:pardo|pardo]] or ([[w:Brown people|brown]]), [[w:Asian people|yellow]], and [[w:Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous]], based on skin color as given by the individual being interviewed in the census.

*[[w:White Brazilian|White]] (49.4% of the population):&lt;ref name=&quot;IBGE2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2006/indic_sociais2006.pdf Sintese_2006_semlinks.indd&lt;/ref&gt; usually a Brazilian of full or predominant European ancestry or other ancestry (such as [[w:German Brazilian|German Brazilian]]) who considers himself or herself to be White.
*[[w:Pardo|Pardo]] or [[w:Brown people|Brown]] (42.3%):&lt;ref name=&quot;IBGE2006&quot;/&gt; usually a Multiracial Brazilian of mixed-race features who considers himself or herself to be &quot;''Pardo''&quot;. In practice, most of the &quot;''Pardo''&quot; people are of mixed European and African (mulatos), but this category also includes people of mixed European and Amerindian (caboclos) and Amerindian and African (cafusos) genetic ancestry&lt;ref&gt;http://prado38.sites.uol.com.br/castrofaria3.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[w:Afro-Brazilian|Black]] (7.4%):&lt;ref name=&quot;IBGE2006&quot;/&gt; usually a dark-skinned Brazilian of full or predominant [[w:Black people|Black]] African ancestry who considers himself or herself to be Black.
*Yellow: (0.5%) usually a Brazilian of [[w:East Asia|East Asia]]n descent, mostly [[w:Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]].
*[[w:Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Indigenous]] (0.3%):&lt;ref name=&quot;Brazzil2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.brazzil.com/p119jan03.htm Brazil - Brasil - BRAZZIL - News from Brazil - The life and death of Orlando Villas Boas - Brazilian Indians, Ecology, Amazon- January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; usually a Brazilian of full or predominant Amerindian ancestry who considers himself or herself to be Amerindian.

Of particular interest to the discussion of race in this chapter is the fact that there is a racial classification that falls between &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot;: &quot;pardo&quot; or &quot;brown.&quot;  That Brazilians have more racial classifications than do people in the United States illustrates the socially constructed nature of race.  Additionally, racial classification in Brazil, because it is based on self-classification and there are no objective criteria for what it means to belong to one race or another, is inconsistent about 21% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telles2002&quot;&gt;Telles, Edward E. 2002. “Racial ambiguity among the Brazilian population..” Ethnic &amp; Racial Studies 25:415-441.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the mixing of the races, race is not inherited but determined purely by physical characteristics (i.e., a white father and black mother could have a &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black,&quot; or &quot;pardo&quot; child).  Additionally, because race is self-determined and there is discrimination based on race (white are favored),&lt;ref name=&quot;Telles2002&quot;/&gt; Brazilians have a tendency to &quot;self-lighten,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mangels2007&quot;&gt;Mangels, Laura, and Laura Neves. 2007. “Racial Classification in Brazil: Discrepancies between Observed and Self-Identified Race..” Conference Papers -- American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; or report their race as being lighter than an independent observer may suggest.  That people can &quot;self-lighten&quot; illustrates that race is not a fixed construct but rather that it is socially constructed.

===Biology and Genetics===
The social constructionist approach has not completely occluded other perspectives.  Some sociologists (and other researchers) still believe that race is a valid and useful measure when understood as [[w:fuzzy set|fuzzy sets]], [[w:Data clustering|clusters]], or [[w:Kinship and descent|extended families]].

Based on these beliefs as well as the development of genetic modeling software programs, some scientists argue that genetic data can be used to infer population structure and assign individuals to groups that often correspond with their self-identified geographical ancestry (e.g., African, Asian, etc.).  Recent research within this tradition argues that self-described race is a very good indicator of an individual's genetic profile, at least in the United States. For example, using 326 genetic markers, Tang ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang2005&quot;&gt;Tang, H.; Quertermous, T.; Rodriguez, B.; Kardia, S.L.; Zhu, X.; Brown, A.; Pankow, J.S.; Province, M.A.; Hunt, S.C.; Boerwinkle, E.; Schork, N.J.; Risch, N.J. 2005. Genetic structure, self-identified race/ethnicity, and confounding in case-control association studies. American Journal of Human Genetics. 76:268-75.&lt;/ref&gt; utilized a software program called Structure&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritchard2000&quot;&gt;Jonathan K. Pritchard, Matthew Stephens and Peter Donnelly.  2000.  Inference of Population Structure Using Multilocus Genotype Data.  Genetics 155: 945–959.&lt;/ref&gt; to identify 4 genetic clusters among 3,636 individuals sampled from 15 locations in the United States, and were able to correctly assign individuals to groups that corresponded with their self-described race (white, African American, East Asian, and Hispanic) for all but 5 individuals (an error rate of 0.14%). Based on their modeling, these researchers argued that ancient ancestry/geography, which correlates highly with self-described race and not current place of residence, is the major determinant of genetic structure in the US population.  While the implications of their argument have been deemed significant by some researchers and could be helpful in studies of racial disparities in health (see extended discussion below), it is important to note that their argument actually demonstrates the social construction of genetic racial categories rather than the empirical existenceof such categories.  Specifically, their study utilized a software program that requires researchers to first decide how many clusters or groups they want the program to produce before it can analyze the data.  After the researchers have decided how many races they think or believe exist, the program then sorts all of the data into the pre-established number of genetic clusters. Thus, if the researchers decide upon 5 categories the program will sort all data into 5 categories, but if the researchers decide on 26 categories the program will sort all data into 26 categories; the program does this without any concern for whether or not these &quot;clusters&quot; or the &quot;number of clusters&quot; are in any way empirically real.  Rather than demonstrating the genetic foundations of race, then, such studies merely demonstrate that a computer program may be used to confirm the existing beliefs of researchers about how many racial clusters there may or could be.  Other researchers, using the same data, found a different number of clusters from the same genetic data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg2002&quot;&gt;Noah A. Rosenberg, Jonathan K. Pritchard, James L. Weber, Howard M. Cann, Kenneth K. Kidd, Lev A. Zhivotovsky, Marcus W. Feldman.  2002.  Genetic Structure of Human Populations.  SCIENCE VOL 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritchard2000&quot;&gt;Jonathan K. Pritchard, Matthew Stephens and Peter Donnelly.  2000.  Inference of Population Structure Using Multilocus Genotype Data.  Genetics 155: 945–959.&lt;/ref&gt;  While some researchers ignore the role of the researcher in the creation of genetic clusters, other researchers point to these studies as the latest examples of an ongoing historical pattern of [[w: scientific racism|scientific racism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2005&quot;&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill.  2005.  Black Sexual Politics:  African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism.  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, a very strong argument can be made that what clustering studies do is verify the socially constructed nature of even biological and genetic explanations of race, racism, and racial similarity and difference rather than illustrate that race is &quot;real.&quot;

Even within the aforementioned studies, genetic research reveals that genetic variation within racial groups is generally greater than genetic variation between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavalli1996&quot;/&gt; However, the existence of genetic differences among races is well accepted by some and heavily debated by others across scientific fields. Those who believe in genetic differences will point to the genetic clusters created in the aforementioned types of studies, which correspond tightly to the census definition of race and to self-identified ancestry, to support their claims.  On the other hand, non-believers in genetic racial difference (and/or significance) will point to the socially constructed nature of these genetic studies to support their claims. In any case, researchers across disciplines regularly finds certain genetic conditions are more common among certain races.  For example, approximately 1 in 29 individuals of Northern European descent are carriers of a mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, whereas only about 1 in 65 African Americans is a carrier ([http://www.acog.org/from_home/wellness/cf001.htm source]).  There is a subset of conditions for which individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at increased risk (see [[w:Ashkenazi#Genetics|here]]).  Based on this knowledge individuals can be offered genetic testing based on their race, which can determine whether they are at increased risk to have a child with one of these conditions. While these associations are important areas of analysis, these associations - between race and genetics - often break down for some groups, such as [[w:Hispanic|Hispanics]], that exhibit a pattern of geographical stratification of ancestry. 

There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. Proponents of using race in biomedical research argue that ignoring race will be detrimental to the health of minority groups. They argue that disease risk factors differ substantially between racial groups, that relying only on genotypical classes - differences in genes - ignores non-genetic racial factors that impact health (e.g., poverty rates and robust neighborhood and environmental effects) and that minorities would be poorly represented in clinical trials if race were ignored.  However, some fear that the use of racial labels in biomedical research runs the risk of unintentionally exacerbating health disparities (as happened throughout the history of Western medical science&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill.  2005.  Black Sexual Politics:  African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism.  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;), so they suggest alternatives to the use of racial taxonomies.

The primary impetus for considering race in biomedical research is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of [[w:disease|diseases]] by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors on the basis of more easily ascertained characteristics. Indeed, the first medication marketed for a specific racial group, [http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.nitromed.com/BiDil.shtml&amp;e=9888 BiDil] was recently approved by the U.S. FDA. A large study of African American males showed a 43% reduction in deaths and a 39% decrease in hospitalizations compared to a placebo. Interestingly, this drug would never have been approved if the researchers had not taken note of racial groups and realized that although the medication was not effective in previous clinical trials, it appeared to be effective for the small proportion of African-Americans males who were part of the study ([http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/23/health/main703873.shtml source]). Despite the controversy, it is clear that race is associated with differential disease susceptibility (Examples of some of these differences are illustrated in the table below).  The question thus lies in developing clinical and public health interventions capable of using racial patterns to alleviate disease while remaining vigilant against the scientific and medical racism of the past.

===Combining Approaches===
Perhaps the best way to understand race is to recognize that the socially constructed boundaries and biological/genetic elements overlap.  There are clearly biological differences between races, though they are small and, as noted above, there is greater variation within races than between races. But the actual criteria used for racial classifications are artificial and socially constructed, as was shown in the cases of the U.S. and Brazil.  

By recognizing the overlap between the two, we are presented with a better understanding of race.  However, distinctions between racial groups are declining due to intermarriage and have been for years. For instance, self-described African Americans tend to have a mix of West African and European ancestry. Shriver ''et al''. (2003)&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriver2003&quot;&gt;Shriver, M.D. ''et al.'' 2003. Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry, and admixture mapping. Human Genetics. 112:387-399.&lt;/ref&gt; found that on average African Americans have ~80% African ancestry. Likewise, many white Americans have mixed European and African ancestry; ~30% of whites have less than 90% European ancestry. If intermarrying of races and ethnicities continues, the biological and genetic distinctions will grow increasingly minute and undetectable.  If a completely heterogeneous population ultimately develops, any racial classifications in that population would be nothing more than social constructs.

Controversies surrounding the definition of ''race'' will likely continue for some time.  But there are important considerations that go beyond the definition of race.  Race and race-related issues continue to impact society. Racial discrimination in employment and housing still occurs&lt;ref&gt;Reskin, Barbara.  2012.  The Race Discrimination System.  Annual Review of Sociology 38: 17-35&lt;/ref&gt;. Because race remains a significant factor in social life, sociologists feel compelled to study its effects at multiple levels.

==Prejudice, Bias, and Discrimination==
'''Prejudice''' is, as the name implies, the ''pre-judging'' of something. Prejudice involves coming to a judgment on a subject before learning where the preponderance of evidence actually lies. Alternatively, prejudice can refer to the formation of a judgment without direct or actual experience. Prejudice generally refers to negative views of an individual or group of individuals, often based on [[w:social stereotypes|social stereotypes]]. At its most extreme, prejudicial attitudes advocate denying groups benefits and rights without warrant and based solely on the unfounded views of the individual.  It should be kept in mind that prejudice is a belief and may not translate into '''discrimination''', which is the actual mistreatment of a group or individual based upon some criteria or characteristic.  Although prejudice can lead to discrimination, the two are separate concepts.

Technically, prejudice should be differentiated from viewpoints accumulated through direct life experience. Such viewpoints or beliefs are not pre-judgments but post-judgments. If the assertion is made that no amount of experience ever entitles a person to a viewpoint then this precipitates a logical absurdity since anyone who opposes strongly-held views must, by their own definition, also be prejudiced, invalidating their own proposition on the grounds of... ''prejudice''. Post-judgments or beliefs and viewpoints derived from experience that maintain unfair or stereotypical perspectives on a group of people is more accurately referred to as '''bias'''. Prejudice can be taught, socialized, or conveyed through other means, like mass media. Bias can develop through pronounced negative interactions with the stereotyped groups.  

Both bias and prejudice are generally viewed as negative.  However, some sociologists have argued that prejudices and biases can be seen as necessary human adaptations facilitating survival.  In fact, there is evidence to suggest that humans have an innate or basic preference for people who are like them, specifically when it comes to race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu2009&quot;&gt;Xu, Xiaojing, Xiangyu Zuo, Xiaoying Wang, and Shihui Han. 2009. “Do You Feel My Pain? Racial Group Membership Modulates Empathic Neural Responses.” J. Neurosci. 29:8525-8529.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans express more empathy when members of their own racial group experience pain compared to when individuals of other racial groups experience pain.  This suggests prejudice and biases may have a biological component, but this line of research has been heavily critiqued by racial scholars that point out that there is no way to establish a baseline, biological system of beliefs or prejudices, and thus such studies may merely reveal early childhood socialization, which has been shown to contain racial training prior to pre-school age&lt;ref&gt;Van Ausdale, Debra and Joe R. Fegan.  1996.  Using racial and ethnic concepts:  The case of very young children.  American Sociological Review 61: 779-793.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Since humans do not always have sufficient time to form personal views on every other group of people, particularly people in opposition to one's own group(s), however, prejudices and biases (regardless of their source) may facilitate interactions (although negatively). Prejudice may also be detrimental to the individual personally by pre-judging a potential ally (e.g. refusing to patronize the only doctor in a town because he or she is black). Despite some arguments about the existence of innate preferences towards individuals who look like we do, there is substantial evidence that suggests most prejudicial attitudes and biases are learned and can be unlearned.

==Racism==
'''Racism''' can refer to any or all of the following beliefs and behaviors:
*race is the primary determinant of human capacities (prejudice or bias)
*a certain race is inherently superior or inferior to others (prejudice or bias)
*individuals should be treated differently according to their racial classification (prejudice or bias)
*the actual treating of individuals differently based on their racial classification (discrimination)

[[Image:ColoredDrinking.jpg|thumb|250px|An African-American drinks out of a water cooler designated for use by ''colored'' patrons in 1939 at a streetcar terminal in Oklahoma City.]]

Racism is recognised by many as an affront to basic human dignity and a violation of [[w:human rights|human rights]]. Racism is opposed by almost all mainstream voices in the United States. A number of international treaties have sought to end racism. The United Nations uses a definition of ''racist discrimination'' laid out in the ''International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination'' and adopted in 1965:

:...any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

===Expressions of Racism===
Racism may be expressed individually and consciously, through explicit thoughts, feelings, or acts, or socially and unconsciously, through institutions that promote inequalities among ''races''. 

====Individual-Level Racism====
Individual-level racism is prejudice, bias, or discrimination displayed in an interaction between two or more people. Examples of individual-level racism could include:
*a person believing people of other races/ethnicities are intellectually inferior and that the inferiority is a characteristic of the race
*a person holding the belief that all young African males are dangerous
*an employer firing someone because of his/her race

Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite young and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKown2009&quot;&gt;McKown, Clark, and Michael J. Strambler. 2009. “Developmental Antecedents and Social and Academic Consequences of Stereotype-Consciousness in Middle Childhood.” Child Development 80:1643-1659.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKown2009&quot;/&gt;  Another illustration of individual-level racism in society is the resistance of Americans to classify mixed-race individuals as white if they have even &quot;one-drop&quot; of black ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ho2011&quot;&gt;Ho, A. K., Sidanius, J., Levin, D. T. &amp; Banaji, M. R. (2011). Evidence for Hypodescent and Racial Hierarchy in the Categorization and Perception of Biracial Individuals. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100, 492-506.&lt;/ref&gt;  While most Americans may believe the &quot;[[w:One-drop rule|one-drop rule]]&quot; is no longer relevant in society today, recent research suggests that it persists in racial classifications, even if they are informal.

====Structural Racism====
''Structural'' racism refers to inequalities built into an organization or system.  An example of structural racism can be seen in recent research on workplace discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertrand2004&quot;&gt;Bertrand, Marianne and Mullainathan, Sendhil. “Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination.” American Economic Review, September 2004, Vol. 94, No. 4, pp. 991-1,013.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is widespread discrimination against job applicants whose names were merely perceived as &quot;sounding black.&quot; These applicants were 50% less likely than candidates perceived as having &quot;white-sounding names&quot; to receive callbacks for interviews, no matter their level of previous experience. The researchers view these results as strong evidence of unconscious biases rooted in the country's long history of discrimination.  This is an example of structural racism as it shows a widespread established belief system that treats people differently based upon their race.  Additional examples of structural racism include [[w:apartheid|apartheid]] in South Africa, the system of [[w:Jim Crow|Jim Crow]] laws in the U.S., and the inequitable lending practices of banks (i.e.,  [[w:redlining|redlining]]).  The figure below illustrates structural racism by illustrating how blacks and Hispanics, even when they have the same income as whites, are less likely to be approved for home mortgages (as a result of practices like redlining).

[[File:Race-ethnicity and mortgages.png|center|thumb|600px]]

Another example of structural racism is the discrimination faced by Asian Americans in attaining leadership positions in corporations.  While Asian Americans are over-represented in professional occupations in the US, they are under-represented among corporate elite.  Approximately 5% of the US population is Asian American, but just .3% of of corporate officers are Asian American.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sy2010&quot;&gt;Sy, Thomas et al. 2010. “Leadership Perceptions as a Function of Race–occupation Fit: The Case of Asian Americans.” Journal of Applied Psychology 95(5):902–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The under-representation of Asian Americans is particularly surprising considering they are perceived to be highly capable, particularly in technical occupations.  But they are also perceived to be less capable leaders due to a perception that they lack charisma.  The result is structural racism: corporate advancement is structured such that Asian Americans are over-looked for leadership positions.

====Cultural Racism====
''Cultural'' racial discrimination, a variation of structural racism, occurs when the assumption of inferiority of one or more races is built into the culture of a society. In this perspective, racism is an expression of culture and is also passed on through the transmission of culture (i.e., socialization).  An interesting twist on this type of prejudice can be seen in how high achieving secondary school students are treated.  African American and Native American students with high GPAs are rejected by their peers while Asian American and white students with high GPAs experience greater social acceptance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuller-Rowell2010&quot;&gt;Fuller-Rowell, Thomas E., and Stacey N. Doan. 2010. “The Social Costs of Academic Success Across Ethnic Groups.” Child Development 81:1696-1713.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that different racial and ethnic groups are rewarded for academic achievement while others are punished, potentially leading to members of those groups to pursue academic success while others are discouraged from doing so.

====Historical Racism====
''Historical economic or social disparity'' is a form of inequality caused by past racism, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and other kinds of preparation in the parents' generation, and, through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.  This perspective argues that African-Americans, in particular, in the U.S. have had their opportunities in life adversely affected due to the mistreatment of their ancestors (see [[w:slavery|slavery]], [[w: Sundown Town|Sundown Towns]], [[w: Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow]], and [[w: The New Jim Crow|The War on Drugs]]).  Disparities in wealth, [[w:net worth|net worth]] and education lend credence to this idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson1978&quot;&gt;Wilson, William Julius. 1978. The Declining Significance of Race.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson1990&quot;&gt;Wilson, William Julius. 1990. The Truly Disadvantaged.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figure below illustrates how historical racism has resulted in lower odds of inter-generational transmission of wealth, which, in turn, reduces net worth for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S.

Historical racism also relies upon the ongoing &quot;whitening&quot; of social history by educational, political, and economic elites.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James W.  1995.  Lies my teacher told me:  Everything your American History textbook got wrong.  New Press.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill.  2005.  Black Sexual Politics:  African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism.  Routlege.&lt;/ref&gt; American history textbooks offer an illustrative example of this process.  In such textbooks, students are generally provided with heroic tales (often fictionalized) of white American founders free from deficit and their racial transgressions are typically either ignored or justified.  Notable examples include the omission of Christopher Columbus as the founder of the slave trade, the racial basis of early American governmental decisions to support or oppose Independence and Freedom movements in other countries (e.g., anti-slavery administrations (like that of John Adams) supported Independence attempts by other colonies while pro-slavery administrations (like that of Thomas Jefferson) opposed these attempts and provided support to colonial powers in these contests), and the re-segregation of the federal government (which paved the way for many Jim Crow laws and Sundown Towns) by Woodrow Wilson. Further, textbooks generally leave anti-racist speakers and activists (like Marie Stewart in the 1830's or Ida Wells Barnett in the 1890's) and facts that demonstrate that American history has not been a steady movement toward racial progress (like the existence of African American major league baseball players in the 1800's well before Jackie Robinson or the existence of African-American political and economic institutions dating back to the late 1800's) out of the American origin story, which leaves the impression that past racism occurred without opposition and always got better (instead of merely different) over time (e.g., that's just the way it was back then explanations that allow white society to avoid taking responsibility for our racial heritage).  In so doing, elites construct an American storyline that absolves contemporary white citizens from the ongoing historical construction and maintenance of racial disparities embedded within American history, culture, and structure.  

[[File:Net Worth by Race-Ethnicity 2012.png|center|right|800px]]

One response to racial disparity in the U.S. has been ''[[w:Affirmative action|Affirmative Action]]''. Affirmative Action is the practice of favoring or benefiting members of a particular race in areas such as college admissions and workplace advancement, in an attempt to create atmospheres of racial [[w:diversity|diversity]] and racial equality. Though lauded by many as a boon to society, giving the less privileged a chance at success and working to overcome historical social disparity, the practice is condemned as racially discriminatory by others.

====Racial Profiling====
Another type of racism is [[w:Racial profiling|racial profiling]]. Racial profiling involves the singling out of individuals based upon their race for differential treatment, usually harsher treatment. Two examples of racial profiling in the United States are often discussed. The disparate treatment of minorities by law enforcement officials is a common example of racial profiling. Another example is the disparate treatment of young, male Arabs in airports who are more likely to be subjected to extensive screening. Many critics of racial profiling claim that it is an unconstitutional practice because it amounts to questioning individuals on the basis of what crimes they might commit or could possibly commit, instead of what crimes they have actually committed. A clear example of racial profiling can be seen in media depictions of Muslims and Latinos.  One study found that major news programs in the US (including: [[w:American_Broadcasting_Company|ABC]], [[w:CBS|CBS]], [[w:NBC|NBC]], [[w:PBS|PBS]], [[w:CNN|CNN]], [[w:Fox_News_Channel|Fox News]], [[w:MSNBC|MSNBC]], and [[w:Univision|Univision]]) described 81% of domestic terrorists - individuals committing acts of terror in the US - as Muslims.  Yet, actual crime data suggest only 6% of domestic terrorists were Muslims (the majority are white supremacists or white fundamentalist Christians).  Similarly, of immigrants accused of committing crimes on news shows, 97% were identified as Latinos even though only 47% of immigrants who commit crimes are Latinos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon2014&quot;&gt;Dixon, T. L., &amp; Williams, C. L. (2014). The Changing Misrepresentation of Race and Crime on Network and Cable News. Journal of Communication, n/a–n/a. doi:10.1111/jcom.12133&lt;/ref&gt;  The result is likely prejudice against Muslims and Latinos in the US.

====Color-Blind Racism====
In the US, the avoidance of racial language by European-Americans has been used to suggest that racism is no longer an issue. However, the continued prevalence of institutional racism has led some scholars like Bonilla-Silva to argue a &quot;new racism&quot; exists, that has arisen during the post-Civil Rights era. Bonilla-Silva suggests that a &quot;color-blind racism&quot; ideology supports racism while avoiding any reference to race.  Specifically, he outlines four frameworks of color-blind racism:

* Abstract Liberalism - using liberal language divorced from context and history to deny racism exists (e.g., all Americans are free now so they can be whatever they want)
* Naturalization - (similar to the heavily critiqued study noted above) arguing that racial disparities, segregation patterns, and other racial phenomena are natural occurrences divorced from historical and structural socialization processes between races (e.g., whites just like to be around whites)
* Cultural Racism - (outlined in detail above) drawing on cultural based beliefs and arguments to explain racial inequalities in contemporary society (e.g., blacks have too many babies or Mexicans are just like that)
* Minimization - arguing that discrimination is no longer prevalent in society (e.g., its not a big deal now like it was back then)&lt;ref&gt;Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. 2009.  Racism without Racists:  Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America.  Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

A powerful tool in our current age of Color Blind Racism involves the depiction of racial minorities via media outlets.  As [[w: Patricia Hill Collins|Patricia Hill Collins]] notes, much of our contemporary media offerings (e.g., music videos, songs, films, television shows, magazine and newspaper materials, and online materials) rely upon and reproduce historical patterns of racial inequality, and derogatory depictions of racial minorities in relation to their white counterparts.  Take, for example, magazine covers and videos that position African American athletes and singers in &quot;jungle&quot; themed decorations, costumes, and settings that mirror colonial depictions of African and Native American slaves long used to justify scientific, religious, and economic exploitation of racial minorities.  While these depictions may appear simply creative removed from their historical context, they continue a long line of images (see, for example, the experiences of [[w: Sarah Baartman|Sarah Baartman]]) that depict racial minorities as ultimately &quot;wild,&quot; &quot;savage,&quot; and &quot;more nature-oriented&quot; than whites (for similar examples in relation to Hispanic people see [http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=418 Latinos Beyond the Reel] and for similar examples in relation to Asian people see [http://www.slantedscreen.com/ The Slanted Screen]).  Expanding on this theme, sociologists have begun to explore &quot;cinethetic racism,&quot; which is defined as the portrayal of racial minorities in ways that appeal to white expectations of &quot;good&quot; racial minorities while reproducing the subordination of racial minorities to white needs, desire, and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Hughey, Matthew W.  2009.  Cinethetic Racism: White Redemption and Black Stereotypes in &quot;Magical Negro&quot; Films.  Social Problems 56(3): 543 - 577.&lt;/ref&gt;  The quintessential example of cinethetic racism occurs in what has been termed [[w: Magical Negro|Magical Negro Films]] - like [[w: The Matrix|The Matrix]], [[w: Bruce Almighty|Bruce Almighty]], and [[w: The Legend of Bagger Vance|The Legend of Bagger Vance]] among many others - where a racial minority character (often echoing historical racism conceptions of racial minorities as magically inclined or deeply tied to nature) exists for the sole purpose of helping a white male accomplish and recognize his inner greatness.  While such films are arguably a world removed from more explicitly white supremacist classic films (see, for example, still highly celebrated classic films promoting explicit racism like [[w: The Birth of a Nation|The Birth of a Nation]] or [[w: Gone with the Wind|Gone with the Wind]]), they echo these films by casting racial minorities as the &quot;servants,&quot; &quot;assistants,&quot; and &quot;natural guides&quot; for white victory and celebration.  In so doing, they repackage explicit white supremacy in a kinder, gentler, more colorblind form for the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Patricia Hill.  2005.  Black Sexual Politics:  African Americans, Gender, and the New Racism.  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Hughey, Matthew W.  2014.  The White Savior Film: Content, Critics, and Consumption.  Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genocide====
While not exclusively the result of racial or ethnic tension, [[w:genocide|genocide]], the attempt to completely destroy a group of people based on a characteristic they share by another group of people who do not share that characteristic, is often the result of racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagan2008&quot;&gt;Hagan, John, and Wenona Rymond-Richmond. 2008. “The Collective Dynamics of Racial Dehumanization and Genocidal Victimization in Darfur.” American Sociological Review 73:875-902.&lt;/ref&gt;  One technique that is often used by individuals engaged in genocide and even in war is [[w:racial epithet|racial epithets]] that [[w:dehumanize|dehumanize]] the enemy, making it easier to kill them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagan2008&quot;/&gt;

==Minorities==
Racism is usually directed against a '''minority''' population, but may also be directed against a '''majority''' population.  The definition of a minority group can vary, depending on specific context, but generally refers to either a sub-group that does not form either a majority or a plurality of the total population, or a group that, while not necessarily a numerical minority, is disadvantaged or otherwise has less power (whether political or economic) than a dominant group.  A majority is that segment of the population that outnumbers all others combined or one that is dominant. 

The issue of establishing minority groups, and determining the extent of privileges they might derive from their status, is controversial. There are some who argue that minorities are owed special recognition and rights, while others feel that minorities are unjustified in demanding special rights, as this amounts to preferential discrimination and could hamper the ability of the minority to integrate itself into mainstream society (i.e. they may have difficulty finding work if they do not speak the predominant language for their geographic area).

The assimilation of minority groups into majority groups can be seen as a form of racism.  In this process, the minority group sheds its distinctive traits and is absorbed into the dominant group.  This presumes a loss of all characteristics which make the newcomers different. Assimilation can be voluntary or forced.  Voluntary assimilation is usually the case with immigrants, who often adopt the dominant culture established earlier.  Reasons that have been postulated for voluntary assimilation include: 
#it is seen as an avenue to upward social mobility
#it is a way to escape prejudice and discrimination

Socially pressured to adapt, the immigrant is generally the one who takes the steps to integrate into the new environment. Learning the language of the country or region, making new friends, new contacts, finding a job or going to school. The adaptation is made more difficult when the immigrant does not speak the language of his or her new home. 

Assimilation can have negative implications for national minorities or aboriginal cultures, in that after assimilation the distinctive features of the original culture will be minimized and may disappear altogether. This is especially true in situations where the institutions of the dominant culture initiate programs to assimilate or integrate minority cultures.  Many [[w:indigenous people|indigenous peoples]], such as [[w:First Nations|First Nations]] of Canada, Native Americans of the US, [[w:Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aborigines]], and [[w:Australian Aborigine|Australian Aborigines]] have mostly lost their traditional culture (most evidently language) and replaced it with the dominant new culture.

An example of a minority population discriminating against a majority population is seen in the racial [[w:apartheid|apartheid]] that existed until just recently in South Africa.  South Africans of European descent (the minority) discriminated against the majority African population (the majority). Additional examples of minorities discriminating against majorities include two instances of colonial rule:
*the treatment of the [[w:Vietnam|Vietnamese]] people by the [[w:France|French]]
*the treatment of [[w:India|Indians]] by the [[w:United Kingdom|British]]

[[w:Racial discrimination|Racial discrimination]] is and has been official government policy in many countries.  In the 1970s, [[w:Uganda|Uganda]] expelled tens of thousands of ethnic [[w:India|Indians]].  Until 2003, [[w:Malaysia|Malaysia]] enforced discriminatory policies limiting access to university education for ethnic Chinese and [[w:Indian|Indian]] students who are citizens by birth of Malaysia. Today, many other policies explicitly favoring [[w:bumiputra|bumiputras]] (Malays) remain in force. Russia launched anti-Semitic [[w:pogroms|pogroms]] against Jews in 1905 and after. During the 1930s and 1940s, attempts were made to prevent Jews from immigrating to the Middle East. Following the creation of [[w:Israel|Israel]], land-ownership in many Israeli towns was limited to [[w:Jew|Jews]], and many [[w:Muslim|Muslim]] countries expelled Jewish residents, and continue to refuse entry to Jews.

==Racial Stratification==
While race itself is a social construction, race continues to play a prominent role in societies around the world.  Race is often the basis for different types of stratification.  Following are some of the ways society is stratified by race.

===Race and Pollution===
Pollution and polluting facilities are not evenly distributed in the U.S.  Communities made up predominantly of racial minorities are significantly more likely to be polluted and to house factories and business that pollute extensively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellow2007&quot;&gt;Pellow, David Naguib, and Robert J. Brulle. 2007. “poisoning the planet: the struggle for environmental justice..” Contexts: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds 6:37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; While it might seem that this is inadvertent and not intentionally racist, the evidence suggest otherwise: these communities are systematically targeted as locations for situating polluting businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellow2007&quot;/&gt;

===Interracial Marriage===
Not until 1967 were laws outlawing interracial marriage abolished in the United States.  Prior to that time, an individual from one race who married an individual from another could be jailed and fined.  These laws were referred to as [[w:miscegenation|miscegenation]] laws (miscegenation means &quot;mixing races&quot;).  This was the experience of Mildred and Richard Loving, who married in 1958 in Washington D.C., a district in the US that no longer had a law against interracial marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;&gt;Martin, Douglas. 2008. “Mildred Loving, Who Battled Ban on Mixed-Race Marriage, Dies at 68.” The New York Times, May 6 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06loving.html (Accessed July 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Mildred was black; Richard was white. When they moved to Virginia shortly after their wedding, law enforcement decided to prosecute them, breaking into their home in the middle of the night and carrying them off to jail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;/&gt;  Both Mildred and Richard were from Virginia, where their extended family still lived.  The judge who heard their case, Leon M. Bazile, told the Lovings during their trial for miscegenation that, 'if God had meant for whites and blacks to mix, he would have not placed them on different continents.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;/&gt; He also seemed to take pride in telling the Lovings, &quot;as long as you live you will be known as a felon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2008&quot;/&gt;  The Lovings eventually contacted the [[w:American Civil Liberties Union|American Civil Liberties Union]], who took their case to the Supreme Court in 1967, resulting in [[w:Loving v. Virginia|Loving v. Virginia]], which abolished miscegenation laws in the U.S.  Even so, as the diagram to the right indicates, attitudes toward interracial marriage did not immediately improve.  Still as late as 2002, close to 10% of people in the U.S. favored a law prohibiting interracial marriage.

==A Research Example==
Devah Pager and Lincoln Quillian &lt;ref name=&quot;Pager2005&quot;&gt;Pager, Devah and Quillian, Lincoln. 2005. Walking the Talk? What Employers Say Versus What They Do. American Sociological Review. 70(3):355-380.&lt;/ref&gt; compared employers' responses on questions involving race-related hiring practices to their actual hiring practices by sending matched pairs of young men to apply for jobs, either both of European descent or both of African descent, but one of the men had a criminal record. Pager and Quillian found that employers claimed they would be much more willing to hire an ex-offender than they were. Additionally, while the survey results showed no difference in hiring preferences between African-Americans and European-Americans, employers were more than three times as likely to call job applicants with a European lineage back in comparison to Americans with an African lineage. In short, Pager and Quillian found that employers, in their survey responses, were more open to the idea of hiring both African-Americans and ex-offenders than they were to the actual practice.

==Conclusion==
After the establishment of European colonialism, the ever-increasing contact between different societies around the globe eventually led to the burgeoning of academic scholarship on race and ethnicity. There were many attempts by scholars to try and understand the origins of societal differences. Were these perceived differences biological or social in origin? In the 1700s, a Swedish scientist by the name of [[w:Carolus Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] was the first to publish on the human divisions of race. From there, scholars continued to use various physical differences, such as cranial size and body type, to classify individuals into discrete races and furthermore make assumptions regarding intelligence and other capacities based on those physical differences. Those perceived differences were a fertile breeding ground in manufacturing and maintaining racism across the globe and even attempted to justify the ill treatment of certain groups of people such as those enslaved. Despite more recent studies providing evidence for the social construction of race and ethnicity across time and space, racism in all its various forms is still prevalent today in the inequalities found in numerous aspects of society that continue to exist along racial lines.

==Notes==
*The word ''race'' was introduced to English from the French in the late 16th century.
*It is worth noting that many historical scientists, philosophers, and statesmen appear ''racist'' by late-20th century standards. Contextualizing these people, their views and opinions in the cultural milieu of their day should allow the astute reader to avoid the pitfall of judging historic figures from present moral standards (i.e., whiggish historicism).

**This article discusses the continuing legacy of racial discrimination in South Africa.  The school system under apartheid favored whites, but even since the end of apartheid, the school system continues to favor whites and the few blacks who make it into the formerly white-only schools.  As a result, blacks in South Africa who attend the formerly all-black schools remain poorly educated and unable to find good work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reusable Learning Objects, NCLB and Special Education ==
What do [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCLB NCLB]] (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001) and Reusable [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Objects:Page2 Learning Objects]], have to do with each other?  The latter could help satisfy the former.  NCLB is an aggressive plan by the federal government to improve student achievement and hold schools accountable if students do not.  Schools must make AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress) with all students being proficient by 2013-2014. If a a school that is receiving Title 1 funding fails to make AYP for two consecutive years, they are required to offer school choice, take corrective action, or provide supplemental education srvices to their students. To do this,  the achievement levels of specific subgroups of students must be raised, with students in special education being one of those subgroups.

Special education means different things to different people.  It can be as simple as a special education teacher advising a regular classroom teacher as to ways lessons can be adapted to make them more accessible for [[http://www.sedl.org/change/issues/issues43.html included]] special education students, all the way to residential schools that cater to students with a particular [[http://www.bridges4kids.org/Disabilities/MIlabels.html disability]].  Despite the location, special education means helping students with special needs achieve the goals and objectives as dictated by their IEP’s (Individualized Education Program).

=== The Individualized Education Program ===
[[http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html IEP]] stands for Individualized Education Program and is the plan agreed upon by the parents/guardians and educators for every child that is designated as needing special education. They are reviewed yearly and altered if needed.

=== Examples of IEP goals and objectives: ===
The student will develop/increase their math application skills by identifying/using graphs and tables to obtain information 80% of the time on an informal test.

The student will develop/increase vocabulary and word recognition skills by recognizing/recalling common sight words, critical sight words: colors, numbers, months, days of the week, Dolch list, and survival words 8 out of 10 tries.

=== Customizing for the IEP Using Reusable Learning Objects ===
In a nutshell, special education is customizing lessons to meet each students’ needs. Reusable learning objects will allow teachers to do just that. Students in special education need to be exposed to the same information as their regular education peers, but not necessarily in the same format. Since students with the same disability can function at different levels, it is very difficult to find a textbook to accommodate a given group of students. Another problem with textbooks is that they are usually written at grade level. Students with disabilities often do not read at grade level. They need other ways to access the information.

A well constructed learning object deals with a single idea or chunk of content. A teacher can string these objects together to create or support a lesson. Searching through learning object depositories, teachers would be able to review objects and find ones that met the needs of their students. Because RLO's are digital, they are limited only by the creativity of the author. The issue of reading level could perhaps be avoided by finding an object that taught through animation. Sound can also be incorporated into learning objects to assist with the reading level issue. As well, or for those student whose learning modality is more aural than visual. They may also need to have the content presented differently, or in a number of ways before they get the meaning. This can be easily accomplished with this digital medium.

In some cases, templates are available. Using a template for a learning object, even teachers with minimal experience can provide numerous opportunities for learning. Once a student is familiar with the interactivity of the particular learning object, the no longer have to worry about what to do and can focus on learning the content. For many students in special education, reading and following directions can be a problem. If a student is familiar with a particular format they can work on their own without having to wait for instructions.

Memory is also an issue for many students in special education. Some need a great deal more exposure to the content than their peers. If the teacher is also the author of the learning object he/she would be able to easily personalize these objects to make them more meaningful to the student. More importantly, they could be tailored to address the specific objectives from that student's IEP. Building quizzes and tests into the objects would also allow the student and the teacher to monitor the student's progress.

More and more, teachers are expected to individualize instruction. Reusable learning objects can make this much easier. Textbooks are expensive and districts aren't likely to purchase individual ones for students as teachers might like. Specialized packets aren't any more practical in the long run. The costs of paper and the purchasing and maintaining of copiers is a constant packets is extrememly time-consuming for teachers. Storing all these accumulated materials also gets to be a problem over time. Eventually, closets and storerooms become filled with leftover materials that either did not work out as expected or were extra because many materials have to be ordered in specified quantities.

Initially, creating and/or retrieving learning objects may be time-consuming, but, once assembled, the teacher need just review and edit them for use with another student and/or class. No more flipping through workbooks and hours in front of a copier or rummaging through dusty closets. With a well-organized favorites folder and a few clicks of a mouse, teachers will be able to construct customized lessons and for students that genuinely reflect the goals and objectives on their IEP's.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How is Ido different from Esperanto? ==

=== Vocabulary ===

Ido is a modified version of Esperanto with a number of changes designed to make it easier to learn and easier to type.

The first noticable difference between the two languages is that Esperanto has the diacritical marks ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŭ, ĉ, and ŝ. These are used in order to adhere to the one letter = one sound rule, but many thought them to be a needless barrier in promoting the language. Ido did away with letters with diacritical marks and instead replaced:
* ĝ with j (pronounced as in French '''''j'''e'' and as the 'zh' sound as the 's' in 'pleasure')
* ĥ with h (the ĥ in Esperanto is pronounced as in Arabic)
* ĵ with j (same sound as above)
* ŭ with u
* ĉ with ch
* ŝ with sh.
* j with y

=== Internationality ===

The creators of Ido felt that much of Esperanto was either not internationally recognizable, or unnecessarily deformed. Ido aims to fix these with more &quot;international&quot; or &quot;corrected&quot; roots. This can sometimes be at the expense of Esperanto's simplified word building process. Below are some examples.

&lt;!-- You may add more languages to this chart to this if you like. But please make sure they have at least 3 words that's alike to Ido. --&gt;

=== Affixes ===

The prefix ''mal-'' (creating a word with the exact opposite meaning) in Esperanto is overused as a prefix. It can be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages. 

The primary Ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the [[Latin]]-based ''sinistra'' for &quot;left&quot; instead of ''maldextra'' (''mal-'' plus the word ''dextra'', or ''dekstra'' for &quot;right&quot;) is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands. 

Ido does not assume male gender in a word.

=== Personal names ===

As stated above, most European given names have Esperanto equivalents: &quot;John&quot; is ''Johano'', &quot;Alexander&quot; is ''Aleksandro'', etc. Because some cultures place the surname first before the given name and others last after it, it is the practice of some Esperanto writers to give surnames in all capital letters, although it is unusual to find this in publications. &quot;John Smith&quot; would thus be rendered &quot;John SMITH&quot; or &quot;Johano SMITH&quot; in the first mention. Most non-Western names do not have equivalents and are rendered as close as possible in Esperanto orthography.

Ido, on the other hand, simply leaves the names as is; &quot;John Smith&quot; would be &quot;John Smith&quot; in Ido. Names from languages with non-Latin scripts are rendered as phonetically as possible. Ido does not capitalize surnames.

=== Place names ===

Most countries have their own names in Esperanto. The system of derivation, though, is sometimes complex. In Old World nations, where the country is named after an ethnic group, the main root means a person of that group: ''anglo'' is an Englishman, ''franco'' is a Frenchman. Originally, names of nations were created by the addition of the suffix ''-ujo'' (container), hence England and France would be rendered ''Anglujo'' and ''Francujo'' respectively (literally, &quot;a container full of Englishmen/Frenchmen&quot;). More recently, Esperanto has adopted ''-io'' as the national suffix, thus creating names more inline with standard international practice (and less odd-looking): ''Anglio'', ''Francio''. 

In the New World, where citizens are named for their nation, the name of the nation is the main word, and its inhabitants are derived from that: ''Kanado'' (&quot;Canada&quot;), ''kanadano'' (&quot;Canadian&quot;).

Names of cities may or may not have an Esperanto equivalent: ''Londono'' for London, ''Nov-Jorko'' for New York. Place names which lack wide-spread recognition, or which would be mangled beyond recognition usually remain in their native form: Cannes is usually rendered as &quot;Cannes&quot;.

In Ido, country names must conform to the language's orthography but otherwise are left unchanged: ''Europa'', ''Peru'', ''Amerika''. City names are treated as foreign words (London), except when part of the name itself is a regular noun or adjective: Nov-York (''Nov'' for ''nova'', or &quot;new&quot;, but the place name York is not changed as in Esperanto &quot;Nov-Jorko&quot;). This is not a hard and fast rule, however, and ''New York'' is also acceptable, similar to writing ''Köln'' for the city of ''Cologne'' in Germany. South Carolina becomes Sud-Karolina, much in the same way that a river called the &quot;Schwarz River&quot; is not transcribed as the &quot;Black River&quot; in English even though ''schwarz'' is the German word for ''black''. However, less well-known place names are generally left alone, so a small town by the name of &quot;Battle River&quot; for example would be written the same way, and not transcribed as &quot;Batalio-rivero&quot;. This is because transcribing a little-known place name would make it nearly impossible to find in the original language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Occasionally it becomes necessary to supplement a colony’s diet. This may be due to lack of food stores, to encourage a particular behavior, or to medicate the entire hive. The following are recipes that are considered to be bee safe. Each of these recipes may be of benefit when supplied at the correct time. 

{| align=center style=&quot;background:#FFC4C4; border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: .2em; margin-bottom: 3px; font-size: 95%; width: 50%;&quot;
| style=&quot;padding-right: 4px; padding-left: 4px;&quot; | [[Image:Stop_hand.svg|40px|]]
| '''Warning''': Unless otherwise noted the following recipes should not be used in conjunction with a hive containing honey for non-bee consumption!
|}


==Honey==
Despite the fact that on first observation it would seem obviously correct, honey is not the best feed for bees. Honey is in essence bee food that has been processed so that it won’t spoil. When given the chance, bees prefer to eat nectar.
When honey is used as a feed, or within one of the following recipes, be sure to know the source. If at all possible only re-feed honey to the same hive it was harvested from. Never use store-bought honey. Store-bought honey may contain [[Beekeeping/Disease#American Foul Brood|AFB]] (American Foul Brood) or other such spores, which are perfectly safe for human consumption but can be deadly to bees.

==Sugar Syrup==
One of the reasons to keep bees is because you can harvest the honey that they create. After a honey harvest, it may be necessary to supply bees with an artificial honey replacement or with a source of artificial nectar, in order to prevent starvation. At other times when real nectar may be scarce or unavailable, artificial nectar can be used to encourage the drawing of comb or to aid in the rearing of brood.
It should also be noted that honey contains materials that bees can not digest and sugar syrup makes for a better source of bee feed. This does not mean that it is appropriate to take all of the bees’ honey. After all, the bees did work rather hard for it. Bees should always have excess honey in storage.
When using sugar, only use white cane sugar. Don’t use raw sugar, brown sugar or molasses as they contain impurities that may harm the bees or may be difficult for the bees to digest. If using powdered sugar instead of standard crystallized cane sugar, be sure to check the ingredients list as some powdered sugar contains anti-caking agents that might be harmful to bees.
Although the following recipes call for ingredients by weight, volume is a close enough approximation as the bees don’t particularly care about the specifics of sugar concentration. 

===1:1 Syrup===
1:1, or One-to-One syrup can be used for supplemental spring feeding and encourage the drawing of comb.

*1 part (by weight) sugar 
*1 part (by weight) water 

1:1 syrup can be made by dissolving one pound of sugar into one pint of water.
Simply stir sugar into room temperature water until all the sugar has dissolved to produce the desired quantity. The dissolving process will be sped up with hotter water, just be sure not to boil the sugar solution.  

Some beekeepers suggest that you bring the water to a rolling boil in a covered pot to kill fungus and bacteria then remove from heat and stir in the raw sugar using a spoon that has also been sterilized in boiling water.  Put the cover back on the pot and let cool to room temperature before feeding to the bees.  The sterile sugar solution will stay clean and clear for up to two weeks using this method.
  
One volume of water plus one volume of sugar when prepared equals roughly 1.5 volumes of syrup.
Weight of water = 8.34 lbs(#) per gallon  1/2 gal = 4.14#  1qt = 2.09#  1pt = 1.04# &amp; 1 cup = .52# of water.

One 2-liter bottle of water
plus
one cup of water
plus 
5 pounds of sugar 
yields just under two 2-liter bottles of &quot;close enough&quot; 1:1 Syrup

===2:1 Syrup===

2:1, or Two-to-One syrup can be used for fall feeding after the last honey harvest, or if the bees do not have a sufficiently large store of honey.

*2 parts (by weight) sugar 
*1 part (by weight) water 

The two parts sugar will not dissolve in room temperature water. Because of this mixing difficulty it is advisable to mix the sugar into near-boiling water. The best way to do this is to bring the water to a rolling boil in a covered pot and then remove from heat and stir in the raw sugar using a spoon that has also been sterilized in the boiling water.  Do not return the pot to heat and allow the sugar mixture to boil, as this will give the chance for some of the sugars to caramelize, creating a partially indigestible and possibly even toxic solution as far as the bees are concerned. Be sure to let the solution thoroughly cool before feeding it to the bees.
It was once common practice to add [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_of_tartar cream of tartar] (tartaric acid) to 2:1 syrup to prevent re-crystallization of the sugars, however this is not recommended, as it is believed to shorten the life spans of the bees that consume it. Alternatively, one could add a very small amount of vitamin C as the acid (ascorbic acid) to adjust pH to 4.5 to impede crystallisation, as an antioxidant and general tonic.

For those without a scale, an easy recipe is 5 parts granulated sugar and 2 parts water by VOLUME. Sugar is somewhere between 170 and 200 grams/cup (depends on the reference)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderandbulk.com/resources/bulk_density/material_bulk_density_chart_s.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ &lt;/ref&gt; and water is 240 grams/cup&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_weights_and_measures&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_%28unit%29&lt;/ref&gt;. So, for example, 5 cups of granulated sugar is 850-1000 grams, and 2 cups of water is 480 grams, which is close to 2:1. Picking 2:1 is a totally arbitrary ratio and is only a convenient, simple ratio for the bee keeper to think about for feeding bees late in the season.

2:1 syrup results in a final volume of syrup approximately double that of the liquid - e.g. 2kg of sugar in 1 litre of water will create 2 litres of syrup.  This is due to the dissolved volume of sugar being less than in its crystalline form.

===1:2 Syrup===

1:2, or One-to-Two syrup can be used to stimulate brood rearing by simulating a nectar flow.

*1 part (by weight) sugar 
*2 parts (by weight) water 

Simply mix the sugar with room temperature water and feed the bees.

===High Fructose Corn Syrup===

(Phys.org) —A team of entomologists from the University of Illinois has found a possible link between the practice of feeding commercial honeybees high-fructose corn syrup and the collapse of honeybee colonies around the world. The team outlines their research and findings in a paper they've had published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Read more at: http://phys.org/news/2013-04-high-fructose-corn-syrup-tied-worldwide.html#jCp

It is not uncommon for a beekeeper with many hives and little time to use [[w:High_fructose_corn_syrup|high fructose corn syrup]] in place of 2:1 syrup, however this method is not cost effective or practical for small-scale beekeepers.
When purchasing high fructose corn syrup not specifically packaged as bee feed, be sure to check the list of ingredients. Many suppliers often add extra ingredients that may not be desired when feeding bees.

A few websites referring to the danger of feeding honeybees high fructose corn syrup, since overheating it during manufacture turns some of it into a compound toxic to honeybees:

http://greenexaminingroom.com/diluting-honey-with-high-fructose-corn-syrup-feeding-bees-hfc-syrup-and-other-atrocities/

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090826110118.htm

http://www.naturalnews.com/027286_HFCS_food_honey.html

http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2009/08/20/the-bee-problem-is-hfcs-to-blame/

Does this mean that high fructose should be sold only if it is already labelled with how much of that compound it contains?

==Bee Candy==

Occasionally it is not advised to feed bees syrup. For example, over winter any liquid syrup that contains higher levels of water than stored honey runs the risk of fermenting, spoiling the stores, and risking dysentry and associated diseases for the bees.  Sometimes when emergency feeding it is best to use a dry or semi-moist food, other times bee candy is used as it is less messy than feeding syrup. Even though bee candy may be convenient to use as feed, it is not recommended as a complete substitution to syrup.

===Un-prepared Sugar===

The simplest bee candy is crystallized cane sugar. Pure sugar, while easy to handle, is generally only fed during dire emergencies, and bees sometimes will carry it out of the hive rather than consume it.

===Fondant Bee Candy===

Fondant bee candy can be fed directly to the bees once cooled. It is also common to use this recipe in small quantities to plug the hole on a [[Beekeeping/Queen Cage| Queen Cage]].

*4 parts (by volume) white sugar
*4 parts (by volume) [[#2:1 Syrup|2:1 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]]
*3 parts (by volume) water

Boil water and slowly add the syrup and sugar until dissolved. Continue heating until the mixture reaches 238&amp;deg;F (114&amp;deg;C). Allow the solution to cool (without mixing)until it is slightly warm to the touch, and begin to mix and aerate the solution, the color should lighten. Pour into shallow dishes or mold and save for later use.

===Quick Candy===

In a pinch quick candy can be used in place of  [[#Fondant Bee Candy| Fondant Bee Candy]], it is easier to prepare, but may not be as easily workable.

*1 part (by volume) confectioner’s sugar
*1 part (by volume) [[#2:1 Syrup|1:2 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]] or [[#Honey| Clean Honey]]

Simply knead the two ingredients together like bread dough until completely integrated.

NOTE* Confectioner’s sugar may contain corn starch - use a blender to make powdered sugar from granulated crystals for use in the bee hive.

==Pollen Substitute==

Occasionally there is a shortage of pollen, or perhaps you simply desire to promote the raising of brood. Pollen substitutes can be used in such situations; however, despite its name, pollen substitutes are no real substitute for genuine fresh pollen.

===Dry Pollen Substitute===

Dry pollen substitute can be placed directly into the hive or used in bird feeders to attract local bees.

*3 parts (by weight) Soy Flour (expeller-processed soybean flour)
*1 part (by weight) Brewers Yeast
*1 part (by weight) Nonfat Dry Milk (Not instant milk)


Simply integrate the powders together and use. Occasionally bees may refuse to eat pollen substitute, most often when fresh pollen is available. It is, however, possible to trick bees to take the substitute when necessary by integrating a small amount of [[w:Vitamin_c|Vitamin C]] into the mixture. Often 1 teaspoon per 5 cups can be added. If a powered form is not available, it is possible to crush a Vitamin C tablet for integration.

===Pollen Patty===

To make a pollen patty, bind the [[#Dry Pollen Substitute| Dry Pollen Substitute]] with enough [[#2:1 Syrup|2:1 Syrup]] to make a putty or dough like consistency.

==Grease Patties==

Grease Patties containing both [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Wintergreen|wintergreen oil]] or [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Tea Tree|tea tree oil]] and mineral salt appear to have an effect on [[Beekeeping/Varroa Mite|varroa mites]] and [[Beekeeping/Tracheal Mite|tracheal mites]]. These effects can be seen when brood is present, and has a devastating effect on mites when brood is not present. However, grease patties with essential oils should not be used during time of honey collection for human consumption. During this time, grease patties without essential oils can be used to a lesser effect. For any noticeable effect, a grease patty of some form should be used at all times.  Replace any consumed patties. 

===Simple Grease Patty ===

*1 part (by volume) solid vegetable shorting (such as Crisco)
*2 parts (by volume) white sugar

Mix sugar and shortening until well combined. Split into approximately quarter cup (~6 centiliters) portions and store excess in the freezer sandwiched between sheets of wax paper.

=== Grease Patty With Mineral Salt===

*2 lbs solid vegetable shorting (such as Crisco)
*3 lbs white sugar
*1 lb [[#2:1 Syrup|1:2 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]] or [[#Honey| Clean Honey]]
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cup pulverized mineral salt (~&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;lb Depending on mineral content)

Prepare the same as you would a [[#Simple Grease Patty|simple grease patty]] recipe.

=== Grease Patty With Mineral Salt and Essential Oils===

*2 lbs solid vegetable shorting (such as Crisco)
*3 lbs white sugar
*1 lb [[#2:1 Syrup|1:2 Syrup]] or [[#High Fructose Corn Syrup| High Fructose Corn Syrup]] or [[#Honey| Clean Honey]]
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cup pulverized mineral salt (~&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;lb Depending on mineral content)
*3 table spoons [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Wintergreen|wintergreen oil]]

Prepare the same as you would a [[#Simple Grease Patty|simple grease patty]] recipe. Remember to wear gloves when handling wintergreen oil.

===Extender Patty===

If a grease patty contains terramycin, it is called an extender patty, and was once considered one of the best ways to control AFB. As resistance has been noted with this form of application it is no longer recommended. 
For your information, the recipe is here.
 lb powdered sugar
 lb solid vegetable shortening  (such as Crisco)
 2 tablespoons Terramycin TM-25

This patty was used to eliminate three weekly dustings of powdered Terramycin. The danger is that keeping a low level of TM in the hive leads to resistance.

==Other==

The following recipes simply do not fit in to any of the previous categories, this however does not mean that they are any less useful.

===General Purpose Essential Oil Mixture===

A commercial, general purpose essential oil product for bees that is similar to the following recipe claims many benefits, but many of those claims have yet to be proven. The following recipe may work about as well as that product.
It has been known to occasionally cause [[Beekeeping/Robbing behavior| Robbing behavior]] due to its great appeal to bees.

*5 cups water
*2 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of sugar
*1/8 teaspoon lecithin granules (used as an emulsifier)
*15 drops [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Spearmint Oil|spearmint oil]] 
*15 drops [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Lemongrass Oil|lemongrass oil]] 

Bring the water to a boil and integrate the sugar until dissolved. Once the sugar is dissolved remove the mixture from the heat and quickly add the lecithin and the essential oils. Stir until everything is evenly distributed. This solution should have a strong scent and not be left open around bees. Cool before using.

===Smokeless Smoke===

A solution of [[#General Purpose Essential Oil Mixture| general purpose essential oil mixture]] and [[#1:1 Syrup| 1:1 syrup]] can be mixed and used in a standard spray or misting bottle. This solution reportedly has varied effects depending on the specific history of the hive. Because of differences between each hive it, is best to try a ten to one [1:10?] mixture of essential oil mixture to syrup and vary the ratio as necessary.   
Have your smoker readily available during your first few trials in case the bees don’t react to the solution.

===Essential Oil Scent Masking Syrup===

Nearly any [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils|essential oil]] can be mixed with a [[#1:1 Syrup| 1:1 syrup]] solution to mask an undesired scent in the hive. Among other uses, a masking syrup can be used during queen introduction or when joining two hives. Simply add the desired amount of oils to the syrup. The stronger the scent, the better it will serve to mask other scents, though be frugal as essential oils have a strong smell.

One of the more common oils to use is [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Peppermint|peppermint oil]], but be sure not to use [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils#Peppermint#Banana|banana oil]].

===Scent Masking Syrup===

An inexpensive scent masking syrup can be used similarly as the recipe for [[#Essential Oil Scent Masking Syrup|essential oil scent masking syrup]]. Simply prepare a [[#1:1 Syrup| 1:1 syrup]] and one or two crushed peppermint candies for every two cups of prepared solution. Load the solution into a spray bottle and use as needed.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Elementary Haskell}}

Earlier, we learned that Haskell builds lists via the cons operator &lt;code&gt;(:)&lt;/code&gt; and the empty list &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;. We saw how we can work on lists bit by bit using a combination of recursion and pattern matching. In this chapter and the next, we will consider more in-depth techniques for list processing and discover some new notation. We will get our first taste of Haskell features like infinite lists, list comprehensions, and higher-order functions.

{{body note|Throughout this chapter, you will read and write functions which sum, subtract, and multiply elements of lists. For simplicity's sake, we will pretend that list elements are of type &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;. However, as you will recall from the discussions on [[../Type basics II|Type basics II]], there are many different types with the Num typeclass. As an exercise of sorts, you could figure out what the type signatures of such functions would be if we made them polymorphic, allowing for the list elements to have any type in the class &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;. To check your signatures, just omit them temporarily, load the functions into GHCi, use :t and let type inference guide you.
}}   

==Rebuilding lists==

Here's a function that doubles every element from a list of integers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
doubleList [] = []
doubleList (n:ns) = (2 * n) : doubleList ns
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the base case is the empty list which evaluates to an empty list. Otherwise, doubleList ''builds up a new list'' by using (:). The first element of this new list is twice the head of the argument, and we obtain the rest of the result by recursively calling doubleList on the tail of the argument. When the tail gets to an empty list, the base case will be invoked and recursion will stop.&lt;ref&gt;Had we forgotten the base case, once the recursion got to an empty list the (x:xs) pattern match would fail, and we would get an error.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's study the evaluation of an example expression:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList [1,2,3,4]
&lt;/source&gt;

We can work it out longhand by substituting the argument into the function definition, just like schoolbook algebra:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList 1:[2,3,4] = (1*2) : doubleList (2 : [3,4])
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : doubleList (3 : [4])
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : (3*2) : doubleList (4 : [])
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : (3*2) : (4*2) : doubleList []
                     = (1*2) : (2*2) : (3*2) : (4*2) : []
                     = 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 : []
                     = [2, 4, 6, 8]
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, we rebuilt the original list replacing every element by its double.

In this longhand evaluation exercise, the ''moment'' at which we choose to evaluate the multiplications does not affect the result. We could just as well have evaluated the doublings immediately after each recursive call of doubleList.&lt;ref&gt;…as long as none of the calculations result in an error or nontermination, which are not problems in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haskell uses this flexibility on evaluation order in some important ways. As a ''pure'' functional programming language, the compiler makes most of the decisions about when to actually evaluate things. As a ''lazy'' language, Haskell usually defers evaluation until a final value is needed (which may sometimes never occur).&lt;ref&gt;The compiler may sometimes evaluate things sooner in order to improve efficiency.&lt;/ref&gt; From the programmer's point of view, evaluation order rarely matters.&lt;ref&gt;One exception is the case of ''infinite lists'' (!) which we will consider in a short while.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalizing ===

To add triple a list, we could follow the same strategy as with &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
tripleList :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
tripleList [] = []
tripleList (n:ns) = (3 * n) : tripleList ns
&lt;/source&gt;

But we don't want to write a new list-multiplying function for every different multiplier (such as multiplying the elements of a list by 4, 8, 17 etc.). So, let's make a general function to allow multiplication by ''any'' number. Our new function will take two arguments: the multiplicand as well as a list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s to multiply:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList _ [] = []
multiplyList m (n:ns) = (m * n) : multiplyList m ns
&lt;/source&gt;

This example deploys &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; as a &quot;don't care&quot; pattern. The multiplicand is not used for the base case, so we ignore that argument instead of giving it a name (like &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;ns&lt;/code&gt;).

We can test &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; to see that it works as expected:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; multiplyList 17 [1,2,3,4]
[17,34,51,68]
}}

{{Exercises|1=
Write the following functions and test them out. Don't forget the type signatures. 

# takeInt returns the first ''n'' items in a list. So, &lt;code&gt;takeInt 4 [11,21,31,41,51,61]&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;[11,21,31,41]&lt;/code&gt;.
# dropInt drops the first ''n'' items in a list and returns the rest. So, &lt;code&gt;dropInt 3 [11,21,31,41,51]&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;[41,51]&lt;/code&gt;.
# sumInt returns the sum of the items in a list.
# scanSum adds the items in a list and returns a list of the running totals. So, &lt;code&gt;scanSum [2,3,4,5]&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;[2,5,9,14]&lt;/code&gt;.
# diffs returns a list of the differences between adjacent items. So, &lt;code&gt;diffs [3,5,6,8]&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;[2,1,2]&lt;/code&gt;. (Hints: one solution involves writing an auxiliary function which takes two lists and calculates the difference between corresponding elements. Alternatively, you might explore the fact that lists with at least two elements can be matched to a &lt;code&gt;(x:y:ys)&lt;/code&gt; pattern.)
The first three functions are in Prelude under the names &lt;code&gt;take&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drop&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

== Generalizing even further ==

In this chapter, we started with a function constrained to multiplying the elements by &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;. Then, we recognized that we could avoid hard-coding a new function for each multiplicand by making &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; to easily use any &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;. Now, what if we wanted a different operator such as addition or to compute the square of each element?

We can generalize still further using a key functionality of Haskell. However, because the solution can seem surprising, we will approach it in a somewhat roundabout way. Consider the type signature of &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
&lt;/source&gt;

The first thing to know is that the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; arrow in type signatures is ''right associative''. That means we can read this signature as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; ([Integer] -&gt; [Integer])
&lt;/source&gt;

How should we understand that? It tells us that &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes ''one'' &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; argument and evaluates to ''another function''. The function it returns happens to take a list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s and return another list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s.

Consider our old &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt; function redefined in terms of &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList :: [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
doubleList xs = multiplyList 2 xs
&lt;/source&gt;

Writing this way, we can clearly cancel out the `xs`:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doubleList = multiplyList 2
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition style (with no argument variables) is called ''point-free'' style. Our definition now says that applying only one argument to &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt; doesn't fail to evaluate, rather it gives us a more specific function of type &lt;code&gt;[Integer] -&gt; [Integer]&lt;/code&gt; instead of finishing with a final &lt;code&gt;[Integer]&lt;/code&gt; value.

We now see that functions in Haskell behave much like any other value. Functions can return other functions, and functions can stand alone as objects without mentioning their arguments. Functions seem almost like normal constants. Can we use functions themselves as ''arguments'' even? Yes, and that's the key to the next step in generalizing &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;. We need a function that takes any other appropriate function and applies the given function to the elements of a list:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
applyToIntegers :: (Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
applyToIntegers _ [] = []
applyToIntegers f (n:ns) = (f n) : applyToIntegers f ns
&lt;/source&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;applyToIntegers&lt;/code&gt;, we can take ''any'' &lt;code&gt;Integer -&gt; Integer&lt;/code&gt; function and apply it to the elements of a list of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;s. We can thus use this generalized function to redefine &lt;code&gt;multiplyList&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList m = applyToIntegers ((*) m)
&lt;/source&gt;

That uses the &lt;code&gt;(*)&lt;/code&gt; function with a single initial argument to create a new function which is ready to take one more argument (which, in this use case, will come from the numbers in a given list).

=== Currying ===

If all this abstraction confuses you, consider a concrete example: When we multiply 5 * 7 in Haskell, the &lt;code&gt;(*)&lt;/code&gt; function doesn't just take two arguments at once, it actually first takes the 5 and returns a new ''5*'' function; and that new function ''then'' takes a second argument and multiplies that by 5. So, for our example, we then give the 7 as an argument to the 5* function, and ''that'' returns us our final evaluated number (35).

So, '''all functions in Haskell really take only one argument'''. However, when we know how many intermediate functions we will generate to reach a final result, we can ''treat'' functions ''as if'' they take many arguments. The number of arguments we generally talk about functions taking is actually the number of one-argument functions we get between the first argument and a final, non-functional result value.

The process of creating intermediate functions when feeding arguments into a complex function is called ''currying'' (named after Haskell Curry, also the namesake of the Haskell programming language).

== The &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function ==

While &lt;code&gt;applyToIntegers&lt;/code&gt; has type &lt;code&gt;(Integer -&gt; Integer) -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]&lt;/code&gt;, the definition itself contains nothing specific to integers. To use the same logic with other types of lists, we could define versions such as &lt;code&gt;applyToChars&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;applyToStrings&lt;/code&gt; and so on. They would all have the same definition but different type signatures. We can avoid all that redundancy with the final step in generalizing: making a fully polymorphic version with signature &lt;code&gt;(a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt;. Prelude already has this function, and it is called &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = (f x) : map f xs
&lt;/source&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, we can effortlessly implement functions as different as...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
multiplyList :: Integer -&gt; [Integer] -&gt; [Integer]
multiplyList m = map ((*) m)
&lt;/source&gt;

... and...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
heads :: [[a]] -&gt; [a]
heads = map head
&lt;/source&gt;
{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; heads [[1,2,3,4],[4,3,2,1],[5,10,15]]
[1,4,5]
}}

&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is the general solution for applying a function to each and every element of a list. Our original &lt;code&gt;doubleList&lt;/code&gt; problem was simply a specific version of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. Functions like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; which take other functions as arguments are called ''higher-order functions''. We will learn about more higher-order functions for list processing in the next chapter.

{{Exercises|1=
# Use &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; to build functions that, given a list xs of Ints, return:
#* A list that is the element-wise negation of xs.
#* A list of lists of Ints xss that, for each element of xs, contains the divisors of xs. You can use the following function to get the divisors: &lt;pre&gt;divisors p = [ f | f &lt;- [1..p], p `mod` f == 0 ]&lt;/pre&gt;
#* The element-wise negation of xss.
# Implement a Run Length Encoding (RLE) encoder and decoder.
#* The idea of RLE is simple; given some input:&lt;pre&gt;&quot;aaaabbaaa&quot;&lt;/pre&gt; compress it by taking the length of each run of characters:&lt;code&gt;(4,'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'a')&lt;/code&gt;
#* The &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt; functions might be helpful.  In order to use &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt;, import the Data.List module by typing &lt;code&gt;:m Data.List&lt;/code&gt; at the ghci prompt or by adding &lt;code&gt;import Data.List&lt;/code&gt; to your Haskell source code file.
#* What is the type of your &lt;code&gt;encode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;decode&lt;/code&gt; functions?
#* How would you convert the list of tuples (e.g. &lt;code&gt;[(4,'a'), (6,'b')]&lt;/code&gt;) into a string (e.g. &quot;4a6b&quot;)?
#* (bonus) Assuming numeric characters are forbidden in the original string, how would you parse that string back into a list of tuples?

==Tips and Tricks==

A few miscellaneous notes about lists in Haskell:

===Dot Dot Notation===
Haskell has a convenient shorthand for writing ordered lists of regularly-spaced integers. Some examples to illustrate it:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
Code             Result
----             ------
[1..10]          [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[2,4..10]        [2,4,6,8,10]
[5,4..1]         [5,4,3,2,1]
[1,3..10]        [1,3,5,7,9]
&lt;/source&gt;

The same notation works with characters and even with floating point numbers. Unfortunately, floating-point numbers are problematic due to rounding errors. Try this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
[0,0.1 .. 1]
&lt;/source&gt;

{{body note|The &lt;code&gt;..&lt;/code&gt; notation ''only'' works with sequences with fixed differences between consecutive elements. For instance, you cannot write...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8..100]
&lt;/source&gt;

... and expect to magically get back the rest of the Fibonacci series.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Infinite Lists===
Thanks to lazy evaluation, Haskell lists can be ''infinite''. For example, the following generates the infinite list of integers starting with 1:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
[1..]
&lt;/source&gt;

(If you try this in GHCi, remember you can stop an evaluation with Ctrl-c).

The same effect could be achieved with a recursive function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
intsFrom n = n : intsFrom (n + 1) -- note there is no base case!
positiveInts = intsFrom 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Infinite lists are useful in practice because Haskell's lazy evaluation never actually evaluates more than it needs at any given moment. In most cases, we can treat an infinite list like an ordinary one. The program will only go into an infinite loop when evaluation requires all the values in the list. So, we can't sort or print an infinite list, but:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
evens = doubleList [1..]
&lt;/source&gt;

will define &quot;evens&quot; to be the infinite list [2,4,6,8..], and we can ''then'' pass &quot;evens&quot; into other functions that only need to evaluate part of the list for their ''final'' result. Haskell will know to only use the portion of the infinite list needed in the end.

Compared to hard-coding a long finite list, it's often more convenient to define an infinite list and then take the first few items. An infinite list can also be a handy alternative to the traditional endless loop at the top level of an interactive program.

===A note about &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;===

Given the choice of using either the &lt;code&gt;( : )&lt;/code&gt; pattern or &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; to split lists, pattern matching is almost always preferable. It may be tempting to use &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; due to simplicity and terseness, but it is too easy to forget that they fail on empty lists (and runtime crashes are never good). We do have a Prelude function, &lt;code&gt;null :: [a] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, which returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; for empty lists and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; otherwise, so that provides a sane way of checking for empty lists without pattern matching; but matching an empty list tends to be cleaner and clearer than the corresponding if-then-else expression using &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Exercises|1=
#With respect to your solutions to the first set of exercises in this chapter, is there any difference between &lt;code&gt;scanSum (takeInt 10 [1..])&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;takeInt 10 (scanSum [1..])&lt;/code&gt;?
#Write functions that, when applied to lists, give the ''last'' element of the list and the list with the last element dropped.&lt;br/&gt;This functionality is provided by Prelude through the &lt;tt&gt;last&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt; functions. Like &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, they blow up when given empty lists.

[[Image:Karjalanpiirakka-20060227.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Karjalanpiirakka, made by Leipomo Eho (a bakery in Helsinki)]]

'''Karelian pasties''' (''Karjalanpiirakat'' in Finnish) are traditional pasties from North Karelia, Finland. Today they are eaten throughout Finland. According to the traditional recipe the pasties are made from a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Butter, often mixed with boiled egg (''[[Cookbook:Egg Butter|munavoi]]''), is spread over the hot pasties before eating.

There are also versions with carrot or potato filling.

== Ingredients ==
=== Filling ===
* 0,5 litre of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 3 dl [[Cookbook:Porridge|porridge]] [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 9 dl [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1,5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Crust ===
* 2 dl cold water
* 1,5 tsp salt
* 3,5 dl rye [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1,5 dl [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] flour

=== Moistening ===
* 1 dl milk
* 50 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

=== Egg-butter spread (munavoi) ===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 50 g butter
* 0,25 tsp salt (optional)
* 0,5 cans, 125 g, [[Cookbook:Cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] (optional)

== Procedure ==
=== Filling ===
# Mix the rice into boiling water reserved for the filling. Boil until the water has saturated the rice.
# Add the milk and stir the filling for a few minutes. Reduce heat and agitate the porridge. The cooking time is about 40 minutes. Stir the porridge every now and then.
# When the porridge is ready, it will seem thickish. Then add the salt. Cool the porridge.

=== Crust ===
# Mix the flours and salt into the cold water.
# Make the dough smooth and pliable by moulding it by hands on a panification support.
# Shape the dough into a smooth bar and divide it into about twenty pieces.
# Roll the pieces into balls, flatten them into small cakes and cover them with plastic.
# Roll the cakes into thin sheets that have approximately 17 cm in diameter.

=== Baking the pasties ===
# Lay porridge on each cake so that the porridge reaches the ends.
# Pinch the edges together with your fingers.
# Bake the pasties in about 250-300 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes until the rye crust is brown in colour.

=== Finishing ===
# Moisten the pasties from both sides with hot mixture of milk and butter.
# Lay the pasties on each other and brew them under a towel and bacon paper.
# Mix the ''munavoi'' ingredients (boil the eggs for 12 minutes) and use it as butter on the pasties.

Marketing your movie on-line is very much like marketing any product anywhere. It will always be easier and less expensive to market a product that meets the needs of a specific group. If you feel that everyone will want or need your product, you will show a profit sooner if you market to specific segments individually rather than attempt to capture the entire market at one time. By addressing a specific segment of the purchasing group you will be able to tailor your web site to the needs of that buyer more effectively. Single men and women may both need your product but express their concerns or needs in a different manner. Attempting to meet the needs of both will dilute the essential message necessary to show the buyer you understand their problem (escape boredom, need to know) and this product will solve it for them.

==Fill a Need==

Perhaps the most essential step to moving your movies online is to establish a target audience for your product.  For this to come across effectively, you first must establish what you intend your product to do.
For example, you may wish your product to:

* Tell a story
* Entertain the consumer
* Inform the consumer

Once you have the purpose in mind, you must next select the target audience you wish to embrace.

== Identify the Target Audience ==

Now you must design your site to fulfill the expectations of the target audience for your product.
Some of these audiences include, but are not solely limited to:

* Adults
* Children
* Men
* Women
* Professionals
* Particular age groups
* Particular ethnic groups

Understanding your audience's expectations is one key to creating a friendly and effective sales environment for your site.

== Product Form, Delivery, and Price ==

Today's distribution media and channels are ultimately limited only by your own imagination.  
You may choose to distribute your film by using:

* [[Wikipedia:DVD|DVD]]
* [[Wikipedia:VHS|VHS]] (or other format cassettes, though VHS is the standard)
* [[Wikipedia:Video CD|Video CD]]
* Direct Download
* [[Wikipedia:Streaming media|Online (streaming) Media]]

You may distribute your film through:

* Your own web site (though this is known to meet with limited success)
* Distributors ([[Wikipedia:Amazon.com|Amazon]] [http://www.amazon.com ], [[Wikipedia:Barnes &amp; Noble|Barnes &amp; Noble]] [http://www.barnesandnoble.com ], and similar resellers)
* Other storefronts, as a &quot;special deal&quot; with other products (a romantic movie could be sold at an online or bricks-and-mortar flower shop)

Be sure to set a price appropriate to both the distribution medium and channel.

== Manufacture and Delivery ==

Now that you have a target audience and distribution channels in place, you must decide how to handle the manufacture and delivery of your final product.  
Some options include:

* Buy and warehouse stock (though this can be costly)
* Keep a small inventory on hand with rapid re-order ability
* Burn or reproduce as needed

== Collecting Payments ==

There are several methods of accepting payment via the Internet, but perhaps the best is to choose a &quot;shopping cart&quot; service that accepts as many forms of payment as possible.  
Among these should be: 

* Credit card orders ([[Wikipedia:American Express|American Express]], [[Wikipedia:Visa (credit card)|Visa]], [[Wikipedia:MasterCard|MasterCard]], [[Wikipedia:Discover Card|Discover]])
* [[Wikipedia:PayPal|PayPal]] [http://www.paypal.com ]
* Check and/or money orders
* Cash and/or wire transfers

== Advertising ==

Once your site is fully operational, you will want to make your product as visible to as many different entities as possible.  
To achieve this, you should:

* Exchange links with as many acceptable sites as possible
* Hand out promotional flyers with your site's address in a prominent position (top-center works best)
* Watch for news stories that allow you to offer information and earn referrals where you may mention your site
* Get T-shirts printed to advertise your site - have your friends wear them in public when acceptable
* Attend and speak at events of interest to your target audience 

== Wrapping It All Up ==

Now that your site is functional and your advertising machine is in full-gear, all you need to do now is to establish and maintain a valid accounting system and prepare for your next movie!

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Asbestos. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Asbestos~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first completely free BSD was 386BSD, at times called, &quot;Jolix,&quot; due to it's development by former Berkeley students William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz.  This lead to immediate issues, due to the Jolitzes' control over the system, as conflicts between outside developers and users and the duo as to how the system should be developed, and to what end.

After the release of 386BSD 0.1 in July of 1992 bug fixes and enhancements to the newly created operating system began to build up into significant code contributions, which had to be maintained outside the 386BSD repository.  This lead to the developers working on these patches releasing them as an unofficial patchkit, and, as Jolitzes and patchkit maintainers had difficulty working together, these outside developers founded the FreeBSD project in 1993 to continue their work without having to depend on the Jolitzes.  At the same time, another group of people were becoming frustrated with 386BSD development, and of the work done by the patchkit developers, and so began their own project.

NetBSD was originally derived from the 4.3BSD release from the Computer Systems Research Group of the University of California, Berkeley, via the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases. The project began as a result of frustration within the 386BSD developer community with the pace and direction of the operating system's development. The four founders of the NetBSD project, Chris Demetriou, Theo de Raadt, Adam Glass and Charles Hannum, felt that a more open development model would be beneficial to the project; one which was centered on portable, clean, correct code. Their aim was to produce a unified, multi-platform, production-quality, BSD-based operating system. The name, &quot;NetBSD,&quot; was suggested by de Raadt, based on the importance and growth of networks such as the Internet at that time, and distributed, collaborative nature of its development.

The NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the first official release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April, 1993. This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements. The first multi-platform release, NetBSD 1.0, was made in October 1994. Later the same year, for disputed reasons, one of the founders, Theo de Raadt, was forced out of the project. He later founded a new project, OpenBSD, from a forked version of NetBSD 1.0 near the end of 1995.

FreeBSD - tell about how they started just to try improving the BSD release from the University of California Berkley

NetBSD - tell about how the project started based on a dislike of the system being used at the time by the FreeBSD people and the difference in the direction they started in

OpenBSD - tell about the project's founding through a developer conflict, Theo's interest in debugging and securing code

GNU - tell about the founding of the FSF, talk about the lisp and MIT stuff Richard Stallman went through

Linux - tell about a student wanting a Minix kernel

Apache - tell about the starting of a patchy webserver

Keep all these direct and to the point, this is to be the shortest chapter.  Try to list the most accurate founding dates as possible.

Talk about networking basics, ARPANET and TCP/IP.

Hey the page is very informative, concise, clear and encouraging :), keep the great job, and here's just  an idea for the declensions patterns: &lt;br&gt;

except for fem. nouns in -sc, the following are universal, also for nouns like 'mezczyzna':&lt;br&gt;


 CASE    SG ENDING      PL ENDING
 Nom        -a            *
 Gen        -i or -y**    - with stem o-ó
 Dat        *             -om
 Acc        -ę (pron. e)  *
 Ins        -ą (pron. om) -ami
 Loc        *             -ach

Now, * stands for the following rule:&lt;br&gt; 
If plural ends in -y then Dat and Loc take -ie plus softening where applies (kobiety, kobiecie,  kobiecie).&lt;br&gt;
If plural ends in -i then Dat and Loc take -e plus softening where applies (rzeki, rzece, rzece)&lt;br&gt;
If plural ends in -e then Dat and Loc take -i or -y** as in Gen (ulice, ulicy, ulicy).&lt;br&gt;

In other words, Dat sg and Loc sg follow the Nom pl. &lt;br&gt;

Now, ** the -i or -y also depends regularly on the preceding consonant, can't recount now which ones.. however, most foreigners pronounce y as i anyway, and are perfectly understood, so it should hardly matter. &lt;br&gt;

yours,&lt;br&gt;

== Inexpensive stopped muting ==
Many horn players own stopping mutes for when the music calls for them. If ever you are playing stopped passages, these come in handy. However, mutes can be expensive. A similar device can be created inexpensively.

'''Materials:'''
* a styrofoam cup
* a pencil or pen
* a straw (optional)
* a pair of scissors (optional)

#Puncture the bottom of the cup with the pen or pencil.
#Optionally, insert the straw into the hole. Cutting the length of the straw with scissors to desired length is recommended.
#Move the straw in and out of the cup while the &quot;mute&quot; is in the horn and you are playing. Tune the mute by adjusting the straw with an electronic tuner.

This is not a perfect substitute for a real stopping mute, but works when in a pinch.

== Water emptying ==
As a consequence of a hornist blowing warm, moist air through metal pipes, a great deal of water condenses and comes together in liquid form inside the instrument. When too much water has condensed, airflow is obstructed and one can hear unmusical ''flops'' and ''pops'' while playing. The water must then be removed.

Hornists usually use gravity to their advantage when removing water. Often, the horn can be rotated so that the water can pour out of the lead pipe.

While every horn is different, there is one trick for emptying water out of the valve slides that is universal across all horns.
#Hold the horn so that the bell is above everything else and the valves are pointed straight to the ground.
#Depress all three valves. Hold it this way for at least two seconds.
#Lift off the first two valves while keeping the third down.
#Rotate the horn back to its normal position and keep rotating until the valves are no longer parallel to the ground.
#Remove the third-valve pipes. All the water was moved into these pipes and can be dumped quickly.

== An Easy High C ==
This works on most horns:
#Play a C in the treble staff, using the F side of the horn.
#Press the first valve lever partially down.
#Continue to push it further down until the note jumps up an octave on its own.

While learning this one, remember that your lips are not buzzing the high C, they are buzzing the C in the staff the whole time.

== Whistle Through Your Horn ==
This one is quite useless:

#Remove the tubing from one of your tuning slides.
#Push down the valves in such a way that the airstream would go through the tubing you removed.
#With your mouth in the mouthpiece, form an embouchure that is like whistling and also is like a recorder's mouthpiece.
#Blow lightly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So far the only basic types we have looked at are Integers and Lists, although passing mention was made of strings and characters.  This section will cover the major basic types.

An important thing to understand about the built-in types of Haskell is that they are not particularly special.  From the compiler's point of view they are special because processors have special operations to do things like integer addition, but from the programmer's point of view they are just ordinary types with ordinary functions that follow exactly the same rules as any other type.  Hence this section contains very little in the way of explanation on how you use these types or what the rules are, because for the most part you already know it: if it works for integers then it works for strings, booleans and floats.

== Integers ==

Haskell has two types for integer numbers: Int and Integer.

&quot;Integer&quot; is an arbitrary precision type: it will hold any number no matter how big, up to the limit of your machine's memory.  That is why &quot;factorial 1000&quot; gives you the right answer.  This means you never have arithmetic overflows.  On the other hand it also means your arithmetic is relatively slow.  Lisp users may recognise the &quot;bignum&quot; type here.

&quot;Int&quot; is the more common 32 or 64 bit integer.  Implementations vary, although it is guaranteed to be at least 30 bits.

== Reals ==

Haskell also has two types for floating point: Float and Double.  These behave like the corresponding types in C.

== Arithmetic operators ==

All the usual operators are there, along with some extras. 

: Aside: Haskell numeric types are tied together in a complicated hierarchy of classes, which will be described later.  The purpose of this page is to give you enough to do ordinary arithmetic without tripping over the type system.

There are three &quot;raise to the power&quot; operators which work differently and take different argument types.

; ** : Takes two floating point numbers and uses logarithms to compute the power.
; ^^ : Takes a fractional number (i.e. a floating point or a ratio, of which more later) and raises it to a positive or negative integer power.
; ^ : Takes any numerical type and raises it to a positive integer power.

Conversion from an integer type (Int or Integer) to anything else is done by &quot;fromIntegral&quot;.  The target type is inferred automatically.  So for example:

 n :: Integer
 n = 6
 x :: Float
 x = fromIntegral n
 
 m :: Int
 m = 7
 y :: Double
 y = fromIntegral m

will define x to be 6.0 and y to be 7.0.

Division of integers is a little complicated.  If you use the ordinary &quot;/&quot; operator on integers then you will get an error message (although the expression &quot;4/3&quot; does work because Haskell helpfully promotes literal integers to floats where necessary).  Instead integer division is done using a collection of named operators.

Haskell has a neat trick with operators: you can take any function that takes two arguments and use it like an operator by enclosing the name in back-ticks.  So the following two lines mean exactly the same:

  d = 7 `div` 3
  d = div 7 3

With that in mind, here are the integer division operators:

; quot : Returns the quotient of the two numbers.  This is the result of division which is then truncated towards zero.
; rem : Returns the remainder from the quotient.
; div : Similar to &quot;quot&quot;, but is rounded down towards minus infinity.
; mod : Returns the modulus of the two numbers.  This is similar to the remainder, but has different rules when &quot;div&quot; returns a negative number.

Provided y is not negative then the following two equations will always hold:

 (x `quot` y)*y + (x `rem` y) == x
 (x `div`  y)*y + (x `mod` y) == x

Just as you can convert a function with two arguments into an operator, you can convert an operator into a function with two arguments: just put it in parentheses. So the following two lines mean the same thing:

 (+) 3 4
 3 + 4

This can also be done with any &quot;incomplete&quot; operator application:

 (3+) 4
 (+4) 3 -- not 3 (+4)

== Booleans ==

Haskell has a boolean type &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt;, with two values: &lt;tt&gt;True&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;False&lt;/tt&gt;. There are also two operators defined on the &lt;tt&gt;Bool&lt;/tt&gt; type: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;.

Numbers, characters and strings can be compared using the usual comparison operators to produce a Bool value:

; &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; : Equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt; : Not equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; : Less than or equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; : Greater than or equal.
; &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;  : Less than.
; &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;  : Greater than.

(When you learn about [[../Classes and types|type classes]], note that the equality operators (&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;) are part of the type class &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt;, and the comparison operators (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) are part of the type class &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt;.)

Haskell has an &quot;if-then-else&quot; clause, but because Haskell is a functional language it is more akin to the &quot;? :&quot; operator of C: rather than &quot;doing&quot; either the &quot;then&quot; clause or the &quot;else&quot; clause, the whole expression evaluates to one of them. For example, the factorial function could be written

 factorial n =
    if n &lt;= 0
       then 1
       else n * factorial (n-1)

The syntax of an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; expression is:

   if &lt;condition&gt; then &lt;true-value&gt; else &lt;false-value&gt;

If the condition is True then the result of the &quot;if&quot; is the true-value, otherwise it is the false-value.

== &quot;French&quot; horn? ==
The [http://hornsociety.org International Horn Society] recommended in 1971 that the instrument be recognized in English simply as &quot;the horn&quot;. No other language includes a nationalistic reference for the name of the instrument. Here are a few examples of the name of the instrument in other languages:
* French: ''Cor d'harmonie''
* Spanish, Italian: ''Trompa'', ''Corno''
* German: ''Horn''
* Hebrew: ''Keren Yaar''
* Mandarin: ''Yuan Hao''

== Terminology ==
[[Image:Horn.png]]
* '''Mouthpiece''': A detatchable piece of metal which comes in contact with the player's lips. A large number of different mouthpieces can be bought, each with a unique ''rim width'', ''cup diameter'', ''cup width'' and ''bore size''. Mouthpieces can be made to be silver- or gold-plated. Typically, silver is for firm, dry contact and gold is for loose, wet contact.
* '''Lead-pipe''': The pipe of which air enters from the mouthpiece and flows toward the ''main tuning slide''.
* '''Valves''': Keys which can be depressed to change the total length of the instrument. 
* '''Pinky-ring''': The curved piece of metal which the pinky-finger is placed in to help hold up the instrument. (Note: Some horn players have modified their horns and replaced the pinky-ring with another device that puts less stress on the pinky, allowing the rest of the hand to be more flexible)
* '''Bell''': The large opening of which the right-hand is placed in and sound emerges from.

The horn is very difficult to master. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of variables which must be accounted for in order to play well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Beekeeper's Perspective==

One reason why more people do not engage in the hobby and profession of beekeeping is that bees are frightening, or may seem so. A small proportion of the population will have a '''specific phobia''', which may or may not have developed after a specific traumatic experience (or lack of experience/opportunity to engage with bees in the natural environment), but will almost certainly have had its onset in childhood. Interestingly, many people are able to adapt their phobic reactions in the presence of children, because it is well-known children can exhibit fear after seeing a display from their elders. The peak ages for developing phobias are 2-6 and the early teenage years. This is when people are making career decisions and developing other aspects of their identity. A simple phobia may influence work in the field, as in those who want to be doctors or veterinarians but cannot stand blood.
Some beekeepers treat their bees like their children, and very often may not appear to be sympathetic and understanding to phobic reactions. They may believe their bees can't possibly hurt anyone, having thought it through rationally with their experience. It is important not to exclude the possibility that some beekeepers may also have a current phobia, or have successfully overcome their phobia.

==The Phobic's Perspective==
(This is a first-person description of common fears that a person exposed to bees could have, and is thus hypothetical. Keep in mind that many fears have not a specific trigger.)
Bees are dangerous. Their sting could kill me and I might have an allergic reaction. I might avoid everything to do with bees-in an extreme circumstance I will avoid consuming [[Beekeeping/Varieties_of_Honey#Manuka|Manuka honey]], even though I know it is good for my sore throat and general functioning. I have terrible pictures in my mind-indeed everything I see, hear, taste, smell and touch which reminds me of bees creates a reaction in my nervous system, which makes me want to die. I even avoid gardens and flowers, and try to buy dull flowers for my garden. The flowers don't get pollinated, so I have a really shocking garden as the flowers didn't grow. I just can't get over the sight of my cousin being stung by a bee. She was four. She was defenseless.

==The medical perspective==
Psychologists and psychiatrists usually take care of phobias. Two treatments, both relatively brief, are effective for phobias. These include the guiding principles of desensitization and exposure. Beekeepers in particular should be aware that exposure is seldom good without desensitization, and normally specific goals are in mind before this process is applied. Family and friends are usually good at accommodating anxiety-producing situations, unless they seriously interfere with life. Phobias are usually best dealt with when the person is calm, and indirect, neutral surroundings are generally used in the first stage. For example, somebody who has a mild to moderate bee phobia could be encouraged by her therapist to read this Wikibook, knowing that the bees are treated in a caring and sensitive manner. Therapy focuses on modifying cognitions (thinking - for example: Bees are dangerous all the time, in all circumstances) and affective reaction (emotion - for example: I just can't get over the sight of my cousin...She was defenseless), to see whether they are rational or not (obviously, the effect on the garden may not be entirely rational, but the possibility of the allergic reaction may be).
The fear of bees is called ''apiphobia''. You as a beekeeper are entitled to ask for a medical certificate, and simple information may be released if the phobic consents. If a friend or relative has this phobia, tread especially carefully. Make sure your bees are well controlled. Many phobias are worse in a crowd, reflecting the fact that bees and humans are social animals.
The first principle of the beekeeper may be akin with the one of the doctor: &quot;First do no harm&quot;. If you can assure the phobic you are doing no harm in your livelihood, you will significantly reduce her fear and anxiety. Often people who used to be afraid of bees are your greatest converts and assets, and it is important to keep their concerns in mind, so your hive is a safe and happy place to be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Runny hunny.jpg|thumb|right|Honey]]
There exist greater than 300 different distinct types of honey. Flavor, aroma and color of a honey can differ substantially based on the flowers that nectar was collected from. Honey flavors range from slight hints of sweetness to great bounds of distinct flavor, its flavors similarly can run the gambit of being a clear as water to a deep dark brown. There exist as many flavors of honey in the world as exists combinations of blossoms in bloom at the same time. The following is simply a sampling of some of the more popular or more common honey varieties.
If you wish to obtain one or more of these varieties of honey the [http://www.nhb.org/ National Honey Board] provides a free of charge [http://www.honeylocator.com/  listings of distributors] for many varieties.

| '''Warning''': Honey should not be fed to infants under the age of 1 or to people with sever immune system deficiencies.  This is due to possibility of botulism spores being present. This level of botulism will have no ill effect on a healthy person.

==Alfalfa==
Alfalfa honey has a sweet mild flavor with a scent similar to bees wax. The honey ranges from a near clear to a light amber color. Alfalfa is an important honey crop in the western United States.

==Apple Blossom==
[[Image:Appletree_bloom_l.jpg|thumb|left|Blooming Apple Tree]]
Apple blossom honey is a light golden in color and may have a hint of apple in scent. Apple blossoms are an important source of honey during the spring in the northern and central US.

==Dandelion==
[[Image:Dandelions.jpg|thumb|right|Dandelion Patch]]
Often considered a weed plant, the dandelion is one of the first nectar sources available to the bees during the new spring. The honey created from this flower reportedly has a strong taste and an unmistakable flowery scent.

==Fire Weed==
Fireweed produces a honey that is nearly crystal clear. It’s the combination of its sweet and mild flavor alongside its color makes it a popular variety.

==Manuka==
Found only in New Zealand’s coastal areas, Manuka produces nectar that is turned to honey that reportedly has more medical uses than most honeys. Manuka honey is noted for treatment of a sore throat and aiding in the healing of wounds.

==Orange Blossom==
A popular honey variety that is harvested in Florida, Texas, California and Arizona with in the US. Orange blossom honey is an light amber with a distinctive flavor and the scent of an orange blossom.
Other than United States, Orange Blossom Honey from Pakistan, is also very popular for its citrus taste.

==White Dutch Clover==
This stemless flower producer is one of the leading honey crops in the US. The honey produced from the White Dutch Clover has a sweet flowery flavor and a pleasant mild taste.

==Wildflower==
Wildflower honey is created from nonspecific nectar sources. It is made during a time and area when multiple varieties of nectar bearing flowers are in bloom. Depending on the time of year and the location gathered, wildflower honey can be drastically different in flavor color and aroma.

== Learning Thai (เรียนภาษาไทย) ==

[[Image:Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|320 px|right|วัดพระศรีรัตนศาสดาราม-Temple of the Emerald Buddha]]
Thai language (ภาษาไทย-phāːsǎːthāi) is official language of Thailand.

Like Chinese and some other Asian languages, spoken Thai is a tonal language. That means that by changing the tone of a spoken word you can change its meaning. This can be confusing for people whose first language is non-tonal, such as the European languages. The written Thai word however, is not so confusing because words with different tones are spelled differently. Though like English, it is possible for words with the same tone but different meanings, to be spelled differently too ('feet' and 'feat')

Example of some Thai words highlighting the different tones.
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+'''Thai'''
!Thai Word!!Pronunciation key!!Meaning!!Tone
|-
|คา||khā||stuck||mid
|-
|ข่า||khà||galangal||low
|-
|ข้า||khâ||servant||falling
|-
|ค่า||khâ||value||falling
|-
|ฆ่า||khâ||to kill||falling
|-
|ค้า||khá||to trade, to sell||high
|-
|ขา||khǎ||leg||rising
|}

The following table is comparing Chinese with Thai about their tones. Note that pronunciation key is adapted form English alphabets with IPA tone markers for Thai. '''It is not same as pinyin tone marker at all.'''
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+'''Chinese'''
!Chinese Word!!Pinyin!!Meaning
|-
|妈||mā||mother
|-
|麻||má||hemp
|-
|马||mǎ||horse
|-
|骂||mà||scold
|-
|吗||ma||(used as last word of question)
|-
|}
Many Thai phrasebooks use pronunciation key without tone marker, even though Thai is tonal language. If you want to speak Thai correctly, you have to study its tone, otherwise Thai people will have trouble understanding what you say.

== Goal Seeking ==

Control systems or Cybernetics are characterized by the fact that they have goals: states of affairs that they try to achieve and maintain, in spite of obstacles or perturbations

Control systems are combinations of components (electrical, mechanical, thermal, or hydraulic) that act together to maintain actual system performance close to a specified set of performance specifications. Open-loop control systems (e.g. alarm clocks) are those in which the output has no effect on the input. Closed-loop control systems (e.g. automotive cruise-control systems) are those in which the output has an effect on the input in such a way as to maintain the specified output value. A closed-loop system must include some way to measure its output to sense changes so that corrective action can be taken. The speed with which a simple closed-loop control system moves to correct its output is described by its natural frequency and damping ratio. A system with a small damping ratio is characterized by overshooting the desired output before settling down. Systems with larger damping ratios do not overshoot the desired output, but respond more slowly.

== Mechanistic World View ==

In the mechanistic world view, there is no place for goal-directedness or purpose. All mechanical processes are determined by their cause, which lies in the past. A goal, on the other hand, is something that determines a process, yet lies in the future. 

The thesis that natural processes are determined by their future purpose is called teleology. It is closely associated with vitalism, the belief that life is animated by a vital force outside the material realm. Our mind is not a goalless mechanism; it is constantly planning ahead, solving problems, trying to achieve goals. How can we understand such goal-directedness without recourse to the doctrine of teleology?

== Cybernetics ==

Probably the most important innovation of cybernetics is its explanation of goal-directedness. An autonomous system, such as a person or an organism, can be characterized by the fact that it pursues its own goals, resisting obstructions from the environment that would make it deviate from its preferred state of affairs. Thus, goal-directedness implies regulation of or control over distractions. 

A good example is a room in which the temperature is controlled by a thermostat. The setting of the thermostat determines the desired temperature or goal state. Perturbations may be caused by changes in the outside temperature, opening of windows or doors, drafts, etc. The task of the thermostat is to minimize the effects of such influences, and thus to keep the temperature as much as possible constant with respect to the specified temperature.

== Survival ==

On the most fundamental level, the goal of an autopoietic or autonomous system is survival, that is, maintenance of its essential organization. This goal has been built into all living organisms by natural selection: those that were not focused on survival have simply been eliminated. In addition to this main goal, the system will have various subsidiary goals, such as keeping warm or finding food, that indirectly contribute to its survival. Artificial systems, such as automatic pilots and thermostats, are not autonomous: their primary goals are constructed in them by their designers. They are allopoietic: which means their function is to produce something other (&quot;allo&quot;) than themselves.

== Goals as States ==

Goal-directedness can be defined most simply as suppression of deviations from an invariant goal state. In that respect, a goal is similar to a stable equilibrium, to which the system returns after any disruptions. Both goal-directedness and stability are characterized by equifinality: different initial states lead to the same final state, implying the destruction of variety. What distinguishes them is that a stable system automatically returns to its equilibrium state, without performing any work or effort. But a goal-directed system must actively engage to achieve and maintain its goal, which would not be equilibrium otherwise.
Control may appear essentially conservative, resisting all departures from a preferred state. But the net effect can be very progressive or dynamic, depending on the complexity of the goal. For example, if the goal is defined as the rate of increase of some quantity, or the distance relative to a moving target, then suppressing deviation from the goal implies constant change. A simple example is a heat-seeking head in a Stinger missile attempting to reach a fast moving enemy jet, cruise missile or helicopter. 

A system's &quot;goal&quot; can also be a range of acceptable states, similar to an attractor. The dimensions defining these states are called the essential variables, and they must be kept within a limited range compatible with the survival of the system. For example, a person's body temperature must be kept within a range of approximately 35-40 degrees C. Even more generally, the goal can be seen as a gradient, or &quot;fitness&quot; function, defined on state space, which defines the degree of &quot;preference&quot; or &quot;value&quot; of one state relative to another one. In the latter case, the problem of control becomes one of on-going optimization or maximization of fitness.

If you could see your future, would you try to make it better? If you were a Soviet in 1980 and you knew that [http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm spiraling debt] would destroy your country, would you do something to stop it?  If you were a German in 1933 and knew that the [[w:USA_Patriot_Act#Comparisons_to_historical_laws|''Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State'']] would lead to a world war, tens of millions of deaths, and the leveling of your nation, would you oppose it?

Its safe to assume that we would all say ''yes'' to these questions.  Our only excuse in letting these patterns reoccur is a claim that we can't see the future with any degree of certainty, but is this claim true?  Couldn't the Soviets have deduced their overwhelmingly probable financial failure based on a combination of proven economic and socio-political models?  Couldn't the Germans have deduced from history that support of absolute power always leads to failure?  Why would the Germans have supported [[w:USA_Patriot_Act#Comparisons_to_historical_laws|a document]] that circumvented their basic human rights when they had hundreds of examples throughout history that such documents are always eventually used for tyranny and oppression?  How could Soviets have possibly thought that the government could endlessly support citizens who took more than they gave to the collective without going bankrupt?  On top of that, how did they expect their government to survive financially while maintaining a horrendously expensive and unwinnable war in the Middle East?  How could they have not seen the future when it was so evident?  What good is history if we cannot learn from its mistakes and plot a better course for the future?  These are some of the questions that futurology attempts to illuminate.

Futurology also uses aspects of multiple disciplines to anticipate forces of nature and predict how we will react to those forces.  In our fight for survival against natural threats, our ability to plan for a future that has no historic precedent gives us an advantage over other life-forms on this planet, including those that were extinguished eons ago.  For instance, taking into consideration various aspects of [[w:Weather_forecasting|weather forecasting]], mathematical [[w:Probability|probability]], [[w:Economics|economics]], and [[w:Hydraulic_engineering|hydraulic engineering]], a futurologist could predict that the New Orleans foundation code requiring only seven days of submersion allowance would not be economically sound.  This would be based on the likelihood of a category-five hurricane, the engineered strength of the dikes in the face of such a hurricane, the amount of seawater likely to breach the dikes, how long it would take get rid of the water, and how much it would cost to replace the foundations of those structures that were underground for more than seven days.  A hundred years ago, foundations in New Orleans were built so that they could withstand being submerged for ''weeks'' without losing structural integrity.  The building costs associated with that level of stability came to be considered overkill, not because the likelihood of level-five hurricanes diminished, but because of one additional futurology consideration: a hundred years ago, the federal government would never have paid for the rebuilding of New Orleans.  Even though [[w:Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane Katrina]] was entirely a force of nature, a futurologist must also take into consideration socio-political trends and the needs of his client.  In externalizing costs associated with long-term risks, futurologists have become invaluable resources for shaping corporate-sponsored government legislation.

Methods of quantifying the effectiveness of corporate futurologists have become a complex science in itself, one that seeks to objectively define the difference between fantasy, science fiction, and science.  This textbook explores those differences and enables society to use the power of strategic forecasting for more than corporate and political gain.

'''Evaporated milk''' is evaporated whole [[Cookbook:milk|milk]], typically sold in cans. It varies from 0.5% fat to 8% fat, depending on whether whole milk or skim milk was used to make it.

'''Sweetened condensed milk''' is condensed milk with [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] added. It contains high a percentage of sugar (about 40%), up to 8% fats and 28% milk solids, and thicker. Many recipes that specify condensed milk actually mean ''sweetened'' condensed milk.

Condensed milk can be used to make many [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] and candies.

Condensed soy milk is also available.</text>

__NOTOC__
== Installation ==
On Windows, run the file &lt;tt&gt;GENtleSetup.exe&lt;/tt&gt;. It will set up GENtle in a directory of your choice, and also prepare for a clean deinstallation.

== Databases ==
There are two types of databases supported by GENtle: File-based (sqlite) and MySQL. By default, a file-based database &lt;tt&gt;local.db&lt;/tt&gt; is set up in the installation directory of GENtle. You can (and should, if access limitations prevent you from working with local.db) create new databases and share them with other users of GENtle in your work group (if you want to).

Database management can be found through the menu &quot;Tools/Manage database&quot;, under the tab &quot;Databases&quot;.
::A quirk: 
::1. Be careful of using the local db for any real development. I strongly advise that you never put anything into local. That db is in the Gentle program's directory and if, say, you need to reinstall GENtle, or you get a new laptop, you may clobber it. And if someone else takes over after that, you can lose it also. I have seen other strange behavior where local.db gets lost, but can't tie it down for a bug report.
::2. GENtle copies blank.db and local.db in [your-username]/AppData/Local/VirtualStore/Program Files (x86)/GENtle It then maintains them. The live local.db is the one in AppData/Local/VirtualStore/Program Files (x86)/GENtle. So, you can delete the one in C:/Program Files (x86)/GENtle and you won't lose it. (This is probably why Magnus did it this way. He was trying to prevent data loss.) But, if you switch computers, this one can get lost. 
::So the first thing you should do for serious work is to make a new db of your own and set it as your default db. And monitor local regularly for stuff accidentally getting into local. The symptoms of a problem are that a project can't find parts of a project.  

=== File-based databases ===
You can add an existing or create a new database via the appropriate buttons. Select the database name and location in the following file dialog.

=== MySQL databases ===
These work similar to the file databases, but require more parameters. Also, a MySQL server has to be installed prior to MySQL database creation. Contact your local system administrator about this.

Creating a new MySQL database might require more MySQL privileges than actually using the created database. Thus, after creation, one might want to remove the database entry via the &quot;Remove&quot; button (the database will continue to exist), and add it again with different MySQL privileges.</text>

'''Mustard''' in cooking can refer to either the spice from seeds of a plant, or '''prepared mustard''', a common condiment.  It is used for its pungent flavor in either application.  '''Mustard greens''', one of the many [[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassicas]] (or cruciform vegetables), contain similarly strong flavor.

== Dry mustard ==
Dry mustard in its seed form can be classified as either ''white mustard'', ''brown mustard'' or ''black mustard''.  Seeds crushed into a fine powder are also readily available in many markets.  Mustard seed is among the world's most ancient of flavorings, found in the remnants of Egyptian and Indian civilizations from centuries ago.

== Prepared mustard==
Prepared mustard can be found in multiple variations around the world, and usually consist of ground seeds combined with vinegar and water, as well as some other ingredients.  The most notable prepared mustards today come from traditions in China, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States.

* '''Chinese hot mustard''' is often little more than the combination of pulverized brown mustard seeds and cold water.  The characteristic sharp, stinging flavor of the mustard comes from a chemical reaction resulting from putting the seed with cold water.

* '''French and English mustards''' typically are among the most potent of the more complex prepared mustards.  As early as the 1700s in France, mustard seeds were ground (with or without their hulls) and combined into a thick sauce, and produced commercially.  [[Cookbook:Dijon_Mustard|''Dijon mustard'']], the best known of the French mustards, uses brown mustard seeds in varying strengths.  It has become common especially in the United States in recent years to combine Dijon mustard with honey for sauces and salad dressings.  ''English mustard'', also popularized in its dry form, most commonly uses a combination of white and brown mustard seeds, and has potency often compared to horseradish.

* '''German mustard''' receives similar preparation techniques, but is often milder due to the addition of sugar.  Many varieties of German mustard, as in some French varieties, are so-called stone-ground mustards, with coarsely ground mustard seeds incorporated into the mixture.  This as well as varying additional spices in the recipe such as cracked peppercorns can give some German mustards a differently strong flavor than those from other sources.  The stone-ground mustards are also similar to ''Creole mustard'' found in Louisiana and other parts of the United States.

* '''Yellow mustard''' first became common in the mid-1800s, using mostly white mustard seeds and given a heightened yellow color from the addition of turmeric.  Yellow mustard is widely used on hamburgers and hot dogs (or frankfurters) especially in the United States, and is a common condiment for other sandwiches and mixed salads (such as potato salad and tuna salad).

== Transformation Processes ==

Transformation processes can be described as some change in behavior which is intended to alter the desired outcome.  Individuals can go through a transformation process that deals with their intellect as well as their overall persona.  Organizations can also go through transformation processes. Usually, organizations will have a change in goal or organizational mission that will trigger for a transformation process to occur, whether it is to have a major down-sizing or to implement new policies and procedures that directly affect the collective behavior of the organization as a whole.  The research involving transformation processes to date explore different models to use for the most efficient processes to take place.  For instance, Creative Dimensions in Management (CDM), a consulting firm, presented corporate transformation processes based on one-on-one mentoring to a succession of UK banking organizations in the late 80s and 90s.  Models drawn from Comprehensive Family Therapy  and Progressive Abreactive Regression (PAR) tries to predict a persons attempt to significantly change their performance, they are likely to follow a zig-zag path to growth, alternatively progressing and regressing as in the following diagram:


[[Image:cdm.gif]]


Concluding the study by CDM suggested that, “''The key to managing these regressions lies in increased self-awareness. As the growth goal increases, awareness and self-consciousness must deepen in order to manage the regressive trends that occur. These trends include moving beyond one's illusions about oneself and one's potential; moving beyond the defenses that protect the self from the anxieties of growth; examining and resolving the ambivalence that prevents a total commitment to achieving one's vision; embracing fears and terrors associated with failure and success including shame and abandonment; and, ultimately, discovering one's will - an energy source that can fuel the activation and achievement of any vision''.”

== Continuous Transformations ==

Another realm often researched is socio-ecological systems which are often described by ''society-environment relations which are relevant for sustainable development within a certain problem area. Problem areas may be the supply of human needs, economic sectors, geographic regions etc.'' Energy, substance flows, technical structures, institutions, and ideas influence the transformation process that is involved in these socio-ecological systems.  It is also discovered that this type of system is continuously undergoing transformations due to its underlined nature. The following chart depicts the study of this system and how it relates to transformation processes:
[[Image:graph2.jpg]]
Further research of this realm suggests, “''The challenge of sustainable transformation is to understand the complex interactions which underlie the dynamics of structural change, to assess and evaluate the impacts of specific paths of transformation, and to shape transformation processes in order bring about desired outcomes'' “

== Sustainable Transformation ==

3 specific features of Sustainable Transformation: 
**1. Uncertainty about system behavior, because of non-predictability of complex interactions underlying transformation processes. 
**2.  Divergent social goals and differing evaluations of the impact of transformation, with social values being endogenous to the transformation process.
**3.   Distribution of control capacities among a broad range of social actors with   specific interests and resources to influence transformation paths.

'''Fiddleheads''', also known as '''fiddle greens''', are the coiled growing tips of ostrich ferns. They are more often available in spring.
[[File:Fiddleheads_Crosses_de_fougère.jpg|thumb|A bucket of fiddleheads]]
The flavor is unique and vegetative, being somewhat like [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] and [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichokes]]. The texture is pleasantly chewy. Fiddleheads are reputed to be a good source of vitamins A and C. Fiddleheads are also rich in vitamin K, important to note for people taking bloodthinners.

Preparation is simple. The ferns should be rinsed and the stem ends trimmed before steaming, simmering or sautéing. They also can be pickled, but should not be eaten raw.
Fiddleheads contain an unknown toxin that causes severe stomach upset bordering on food poisoning. Always blanch, boil, or steam before eating.

Fiddleheads should be eaten soon after purchase, although they may be stored for a few days, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator, if need be.  They can also be stored in water in the fridge for up to a week if you change the water every two days. 

Most of the greens sold as fiddleheads are immature ostrich ferns (''Matteuccia struthiopteris'') of northeastern North America, which are safe for most people to eat. However, if wild-gathered, care should be taken to ensure that the fiddleheads are ostrich ferns.  Cinnamon ferns (''Osmundastrum cinnamomeum'') and interrupted ferns (''Osmunda claytoniana'') are often mistaken for ostrich ferns, though easy to tell apart if one knows what to look for.  Ostrich fiddleheads are not covered with wool and have a groove running up the stem.  Bracken (''Pteridium aquilinum'') is considered carcinogenic.  Fiddleheads must be broken off with the flick of the wrist and never cut, as cutting prevents the plant from regenerating.

In preparation for eating, the fiddleheads must be cleaned of their brown-colored silk, which resembles the inside skin of a roasted peanut, but is not tasty. This is most easily accomplished with the aid of a garden hose, and some sort of screening device. 

Blanching the fiddleheads is a must if they are to be frozen (which the recommended way of storing them, for up to eighteen months) and is also preferable if they are to be eaten immediately. This removes the bitterness from the plant, which can cause stomach upset for some. Blanching is done is by bringing the cleaned fiddleheads just to a boil in a large pot of water, and then immediately rinsing them and disposing of the water. One will notice that the water has turned black. 	

After the rinse, either return them to the pot (with fresh water) to resume cooking, or plunge them in ice cold water to stop the internal cooking process, and then place them in freezer bags, and then into the freezer. 	

Cooked fiddleheads are done when they have lost their crunchiness, but not become soggy. This is ''al dente'' cooking. Served with real butter, and salt, some people also like to add a little cider vinegar. Their subtle flavor interpolates between sweet, mild asparagus and an un-bitter version of cooked baby spinach.

'''Honey Taffy''' – This recipe entails a good workout with the reward of unmistakably honey-flavored candies. This recipe can be completed by a single chef, but is much more fun with the help of friends and family.

==Ingredients==

*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 tablespoons cornstarch
*1 cup liquid [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], any variety
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==

#In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] combine the sugar, salt and cornstarch until uniform.
#Using a wooden or metal spoon, stir in the honey and the water. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and continually stir until all the sugar dissolves.
#Continue to stir the mixture until the mixture begins to boil. Once boiling begins, let the solution cook undisturbed until it reaches 270&amp;deg;F/132&amp;deg;C also known as the [[Cookbook:Cold Water Candy Test#Soft Crack|soft crack stage]]. Add the butter.
#Remove the hot mixture from heat and pour onto a greased, lipped cookie sheet, a greased marble slab, or a silicone mat, such as a [[Cookbook:Silpat|Silpat]].
#When taffy is cool enough to handle with greased cleaned hands, gather the taffy and continually stretch, fold and recombine it until it lightens in color and gains a satiny gloss. This step is best accomplished with a friend. This step requires 10 to 15 minutes of constant pulling.
#Once taffy has been properly pulled, roll into 1/2 inch ropes and cut into 1 inch long pieces with a knife or greased scissors. Once all the taffy is cut, wrap in small squares of waxed paper and twist the ends.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Be extremely careful around the boiling solution, as it gets extremely hot and sticks like tar.
*Use a wooden or metal spoon for this recipe, as most plastic spoons will melt or deform.  A wooden spoon is best because a metal spoon will get very hot in the sugar syrup.
*You can add extra flavoring or coloring to the taffy if you mix it in at the same time as the butter.
*If you don’t like honey, or don’t want to use a lot of it, you can substitute [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]] for equal parts of the missing honey.
*If you want some extra reward for extra effort, try making two batches with different colors and/or flavors at once, and twisting or braiding the taffy ropes before cutting to make interesting combinations.
*If you don't have cornstarch, you can use 1 tsp. of vinegar instead to help prevent recrystallization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Computer Generated Imagery ==

'''Computer-generated imagery''' ('''CGI''') is the application of the field of computer graphics (or more specifically 3D computer graphics) to special effects. CGI is used in movies, television programs and commercials, and in printed media. Real-time computer graphics, such as those in video games, are rarely referred to as CGI.

CGI is used because it is often cheaper than physical methods, such as constructing elaborate miniatures for effects shots or hiring a great deal of extras for crowd scenes, and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other method. It can also allow a single artist to produce content without the use of actors or other contributors to the project.

2D CGI was first used in movies in 1973's Westworld, though the first use of 3D imagery was in its sequel, Futureworld (1976), which featured a computer-generated hand and face created by then University of Utah graduate students Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke. The first two films to make heavy investments in CGI, Tron (1982) and The Last Starfighter (1984), were commercial failures, causing most directors to relegate CGI to images that were supposed to look like they were created by a computer. Photorealistic CGI did not win over the motion picture industry until 1989, when The Abyss won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. Industrial Light and Magic produced photorealistic CGI visual effects, including a seawater creature lovingly dubbed the water weenie, for the film.

2D CGI increasingly appeared in &quot;traditional&quot; animated films, where it supplemented the use of hand-illustrated cels. Its uses ranged from digital tweening motion between frames, to eye-catching quasi-3D effects such as the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast.

In 1995, the first fully computer-generated feature film, Pixar's Toy Story, was a resounding commercial success. Additional digital animation studios such as Blue Sky Studios (Fox) and Pacific Data Images (Dreamworks SKG) went into production, and existing animation companies such as Disney began to make a transition from traditional animation to CGI.

Between 1995 and 2005 the average effects budget for a wide-release feature film skyrocketed from $5 million to $40 million. According to one studio executive, as of 2005, more than half of feature films have significant effects.

In the early 2000s, computer-generated imagery became the dominant form of special effects. The technology progressed to the point that it became possible to include virtual stunt doubles that were nearly indistinguishable from the actors they replaced. Computer-generated extras also became used extensively in crowd scenes. The timeline of CGI in movies shows a detailed list of pioneering uses of computer-generated imagery in film and television.

CGI for films is usually rendered at about 1.4–6 megapixels. Toy Story, for example, was rendered at 1536 × 922. The time to render one frame is typically around 2–3 hours, with ten times that for the most complex scenes. This time hasn't changed much in the last decade, as image quality progressed at the same rate as improvements in hardware.

Developments in CGI technologies are reported each year at SIGGRAPH, an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, attended each year by tens of thousands of computer professionals.

Developers of computer games and 3D video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real-time as is possible for CGI films and animation. With the rapid advancement of real-time rendering quality, artists began to use game engines to render non-interactive movies. This art form is called machinima.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Learning Management Systems in the Healthcare Environment==
Education in the [[w:Healthcare|healthcare]] environment is essential to produce quality well-trained [[w:Employee#Employee|employees]]. In the past, classroom training in a face-to-face environment was the main way that employees were provided their initial and ongoing training needed to perform their job responsibilities. This required the employees to be away from their work environment, whether that be providing [[w:Patient|patient]] care or working in an administrative or clerical position, for a period of time. This meant that their duties were either not being done during that time or another employee would have to pick up the additional responsibilities. All of this causes an increase in costs for the corporation as well as potential safety issues if the employee is providing patient care. A [[w:Learning management system|learning management system]] can help alleviate some of the problems that hospitals face in the traditional classroom training environment. 

==Regulatory Agency Requirements==
Implementing a learning management system, while initially can be a costly investment, over time can prove to be a well spent investment. More and more [[w:Hospital|hospitals]] are required to provide mandatory yearly education to their employees due to regulatory agency requirements. Examples of some of the regulatory agencies that put demands on healthcare include, but are not limited to:

Regulatory Agencies:
*[[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]
*[http://www.jointcommission.org/ The Joint Commission
*[http://www.mpro.org/ MPRO]

CMS, Centers for [[w:Medicare (United_States)|Medicare]] and Medicaid Services is a federally funded program that is concerned, like most other regulatory agencies with the quality of healthcare being provided to the beneficiaries of medicare and medicaid. They are involved in many programs that look at quality and confidentiality such as  
[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa/ HIPPA] , the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is one example of a regulation mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. HIPPA is related to insurance coverage for individuals as well as confidentiality compliance that must be followed by hospitals as well as many other healthcare businesses such as physician offices, insurance companies, etc. Hospitals must provide education to their employees on how to handle electronically printed medical information about patients.

Another regulatory agency that puts demands on hospitals as far as educating their employees is The Joint Commission.  [http://www.jointcommission.org/ The Joint Commission].
JCAHO provides accreditation to healthcare facilities following a site visit and review of the institution. The Joint Commission is concerned with the care provided to patients. A current initiative of the Joint Commission is patient safety. A LMS can provide education about patient safety, initiatives the hospital is instituting to assist in patient safety and what healthcare providers can do to provide safe care to their patients.

[http://www.mpro.org/ MPRO] is a state of [[w:Michigan|Michigan]] based organization that looks at healthcare quality and ways for healthcare institutions to improve care to their patients. Based on their reviews of a hospitals services they may offer suggestions for ways to improve processes that are used in the healthcare environment. A LMS is a way to provide education to healthcare providers on how to utilize the information and suggestions made by MPRO to improve the delivery of care to their patients.

==Continuing Education Requirements==
According to [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/home.asp ACGME's],Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education website; ACGME “is a private, non-profit council that evaluates and accredits medical residency programs in the United States. The mission of the ACGME is to improve the quality of health care in the United States by ensuring and improving the quality of graduate medical education for physicians in training.” [http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/newsRoom/newsRm_acGlance.asp Reference citation]
[[w:Medical resident|Medical residents]] are required to obtain a certain amount of hours worked in a teaching hospital as well as continuing medical education requirements.
[[w:Physician|Physicians]] are also required to obtain continuing medical education credits every three years while they are in practice, in order to maintain their licensure.  Each state varies as to what those requirements are. [[w:Registered_Nurse|Registered nurses]] are also required to obtain continuing education contact hours every two years to maintain their license.  This number also varies by state and may have specific requirements as to the type or content of contact hours that must be obtained.  A learning management system can be used to offer courses to both physicians and nurses as well as any other category of staff that require continuing education for licensure.  The LMS can also be used to track whether or not staff have the met licensure requirements

==Benefits for a Healthcare Environment ==
For example, a large teaching hospital located in a suburb of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit Detroit]is a 1,061 bed hospital that has approximately 13,000 employees. Based on the type of employee, there are required yearly educational programs/material that must be mastered. Many of these requirements are mandated by the outside regulatory agencies described above.  Some examples of the courses are:
*Patient Confidentiality
*Electrical Safety
*Fire Safety
*Corporate Compliance
*Emergency Management

In order for a hospital of this size to maintain records of completion and mastery of the required course/information, a LMS is an invaluable tool. It provides the hospital with an easy way to track all employee records and provide the regulatory agencies with proof of compliance.


Benefits also include: 
*Reduction of scheduling personnel to attend training programs.
*Delivery of training anytime – day or night.
*Access to training at home or on the job.
*Consistent content delivery.
*Opportunities for the EMS system to provide updated information to EMS practitioners.

''Simple and easy to use.''
The LMS has the capability to track overall user progress, evaluate program content, score tests, and create certificates.  In addition to the course content there can be: 
*An information library
*Course tests
*Program content surveys

When sugar syrup is cooked, water boils away resulting in a high temperature sugar concentrate. Hence, as the temperature raises so does the concentration of sugar within the solution. The nifty thing about cooking sugar is that the highest temperature it reaches can tell you a little something about how it will turn out once it cools down to room temperature.
Often it is practical to use a [[Cookbook:Candy Thermometer|candy thermometer]] how ever using the cold water test can be more fun (and dangerous). Note that the following temperatures are listed at sea level, as they are listed in most cookbooks, because of this actually using the cold water test can be a more reliable gage when making candy.
Each test is completed by dropping a dollop of the hot candy solution in cold water (not room temperature), and then extracting the candy formed. Be sure to allow for a moment for the candy to cool before handling it to avoid getting burnt.

==Thread==
230&amp;deg;F-235&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 80%&lt;br&gt;
At this point there is a lot of water left in the syrup. When cooled in water it will create a liquid thread than cannot be easily collected. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is proper for making syrup such as [[Cookbook:Chocolate Syrup|Chocolate Syrup]] but is not technically a candy.

==Soft Ball==
235&amp;deg;F-240&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 85%&lt;br&gt; 
At this point the syrup dropped in to cold water can be formed in to a soft and flexible ball. At this point the candy cannot easily support itself and will begin to run if left out. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is proper for making items such as [[Cookbook:Fudge|Fudge]].

==Firm Ball==
245&amp;deg;F-250&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 87%&lt;br&gt;
A little syrup at this temperature dropped in to a cold water bath will create a firm chewy ball that can support its own weight and will remain chewy. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is appropriate for making candies such as [[Cookbook:Caramel|Caramel]], but please note this in not the same thing as [[Cookbook:Caramelizing|Caramelizing]].

==Hard Ball==
250&amp;deg;F-255&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 92%&lt;br&gt;  
At this stage the syrup solution will form thick ropy threads when quenched in cooled water. If a large enough quantity is cooled it will form a hard ball with little moisture. &lt;br&gt; This temperature is best suited for recipes such as [[Cookbook:Rock Candy|Rock Candy]] or 

==Soft Crack==
270&amp;deg;F-290&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 95%&lt;br&gt; 
When the solution reaches this stage the bubbles will become obviously smaller and more concentrated. The candy at this stage has a low moisture point and will create small flexible threads when dropped in the cold water. &lt;br&gt;
This stage is optimal for recipes such as [[Cookbook:Honey Taffy|Honey Taffy]] or  [[Cookbook:Salt Water Taffy|Salt Water Taffy]].

==Hard Crack==
300&amp;deg;F-310&amp;deg;F&lt;br&gt;
Sugar Concentration at approximately 99%&lt;br&gt;  
At this point the moisture levels are nearly non-existent, it is also the highest recipe that will be used in a standard candy recipe, after this point you enter the region of [[Cookbook:Caramelizing|caramelizing]]. A small amount of syrup, when dropped in to cold water, will become brittle threads and easily break when bent or dropped. &lt;br&gt;
This final stage is used for creating [[Cookbook:Toffee|Toffee]] and [[Cookbook:Hard Candy|Hard Candy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Making animations on a computer can be relatively cheap, horrendously expensive, or anywhere in between.  Your requirements will depend on what exactly you want to do (more on the different types of animation in chapter 4), but it's safe to say most hobbyists can get involved with minimal outlay.

== Hardware  ==

Most of the equipment here you will already have, or can pick up cheaply.  Unless you plan to make broadcast quality animation, don't worry about going for the cheaper models as the differences at the lower end of the market are negligible.

'''A PC'''

For any sort of graphics work, the faster your PC's processor the better.  Also, the more memory it has in terms of RAM and hard-drive space the better.  Any computer bought within the last year or two should be able to handle the majority of animation tasks comfortably however.

If you have money to burn, you might want to consider increasing the RAM in your PC to its maximum amount as this will greatly enhance your user experience when working with large files.  Another upgrade which is always worthwhile if you do a lot of graphics work is a bigger hard-drive as the files you generate build up quickly.

For certain types of animation such as machinima or 3d, you may want to consider upgrading your graphics card to the best you can afford.  For most animation purposes, any relatively modern graphics card will do, there is no need to go for the staggeringly expensive model on the bleeding edge.

'''A Digital Camera'''

An absolute essential.  Probably the easiest way to get a source image to modify without having to worry about copyright implications.

A digital camera, as opposed to a film or video camera, uses an electronic sensor to transform images (or video) into electronic data. Modern digital cameras are typically multifunctional and the same device can take photographs, video, and/or sound.

In 2005, digital cameras are starting to push traditional film cameras out of many markets. Shrinking device sizes have recently allowed miniaturized digital cameras to be included in multifunctional devices, such as cell phones and PDAs.  There is no particular need to go for the most expensive model, but it does not hurt to get the best resolution you can afford.

{{Wikipedia|Digital camera}}


'''A Scanner'''

Not essential, unless you have a lot of images on paper you would like to work with on your PC.  A scanner is a device which reads in an image and converts it to electronic data, and in appearance it is usually a flat panel similar to the top of a photocopier.

Those who prefer to sketch with pen and paper can find that a scanner is a useful addition to their workstation, enabling them to transfer their doodles and rough sketches to the PC for processing.  Only those who need to scan intricately detailed or overlarge pieces of work should consider buying an expensive model.

'''A Graphics Tablet'''

A graphics tablet (or digitizing tablet) is a computer peripheral device that allows for a relatively simple method of inputting hand-drawn graphics or art into a computer in real time. They typically consist of a large flat surface for drawing on, and an attached &quot;stylus&quot; for drawing on the surface, originally as a part of the electronics, but later simply to provide an accurate but smooth &quot;point&quot;.

Graphics tablets sometimes take a little bit of getting used to, but the fact that they are usually more sensitive and intuitive than a mouse means most serious electronic artists swear by them.  Although these can be picked up pretty cheaply, it is best only using the budget models to try out tablets for the first time, and to quickly upgrade if you plan to be using one often.

'''Sound Hardware'''

Most animations require some sort of soundtrack, and you may need to create some of the sounds yourself.  Sounds are input and output from a sound card or sound chip (which may be part of your PC's motherboard, or a separate card), and it is likely that the sound card which came with your computer will be suitable for your purposes.

The sound card will have an input for a microphone, a line-in, and a joypad or MIDI keyboard.  A microphone is a handy thing to have for recording sound effects and voice tracks, but the budget models should be sufficient for this.  The line in socket is used to record audio from an external device such as an ipod or cassette deck and requires a cable with a headphone jack at either end to use.

A MIDI keyboard can be useful if you are at-all musical and capable of creating your own music tracks.  These are basically mini piano-style keyboards that interface with your PC and use the PC's software to generate sound, which is then output through the PC's speakers.

== Software ==

This list is in no way intended to be exhaustive, and splits the required software into a few broad categories of which a few representative examples are given.  Where possible, any free or Open Source Software(OSS) available is highlighted.

'''Image Manipulation Software'''

This is what you use to transform the images you work with, moulding them to fit the requirements of your animation, and modifying them to create the key elements.  Any decent application will allow you to play with the size, colouring, and content of your images.  It will allow you to splice them together into montages, to split them into their component parts, and much, much more.  Whichever piece of software you use, taking the time to learn how to use it well will pay dividends in terms of the time it takes you to make an animation, and the animation's quality when it's done.

The market leader and industry standard is [[w:Photoshop|Adobe Photoshop]], which can be an expensive purchase for a beginner.  There are cheaper alternatives such as Paint Shop Pro available, and a reduced price version of Photoshop (with consequently reduced functionality) called Photoshop Elements is also on the market.

The leading OSS for image manipulation is The GIMP, an excellent and powerful alternative to commercial equivalents.  The only problem with the GIMP is its non-standard interface which may prove daunting to beginners.

'''Animation Software'''

The leading software in 2D computer animation is Adobe Flash. This is the program that is commonly used to create animations for the Internet in SWF format, also known as &quot;flash cartoons&quot; or &quot;flashtoons.&quot; It also has its own built-in programming language called Actionscript that can be applied to its animations.

'''3D Animation'''

For those looking to start in CG animation, the leading opensource alternative is [[w:Blender|Blender]], frequently updated, and has an excellent user base to help newbies and pros alike. No program can be more highly recommended than Blender 3d. There are many [[Blender|Wikibooks on Blender]].

There are many types of 3D animation software available. Some, like Maya, [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13567410 3D Studio Max], and Cinema4D, are available from various sources for a commercial-size price. Maya, for example, can cost thousands for the higher-end versions - but it may be worth the money, as many professional CG companies use it.

'''Sound and Music Software'''

== Brothers or both? ==

The last sentence of the article says that 'brother cheetahs will sometimes form partnerships...' does this mean that only males form alliances or does it mean siblings in general?

:[[User:Hdavis|Hdavis]]

:Only males form alliances, and these alliances are usually brothers.  Females are solitary except while breeding or raising offspring.  A rather intersting story surfaced not long ago, when an adult male who was obviously having great difficulty getting prey in a very lean time came up to an adult female who was feeding.  She at first tried to shoo him off but later accepted his &quot;begging&quot; and allowed him to eat with her.  Later it was established that the male was one of her sons from a previous litter.  Apparently he still loved his mother, and she still harbored a reluctant affection for him.  The whole concept of &quot;solitary&quot; cats is more often than not misunderstood.  [[User:John Burkitt|John Burkitt]] 18:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

== How do cheetahs raise their young? ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Females give birth to three to five cubs at a time. Many cubs are killed by a lack of food or their natural enemies (lions and hyenas).  An old African legend says the tear stain marks on the cheetah's face are from the mother weeping for her lost cubs.  The mother cheetah must train the young cubs to hunt food for themselves so they can survive on their own. The cubs leave their mother about one or two years later, and will usually live in groups of two or three while reaching adulthood.  Female cheetahs eventually go their separate ways, but brother cheetahs usually form lifelong partnerships and share in the hunt to survive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I removed this raising young section (quote above for cheetahs) for all of the cats and combined them to form a single page to talk about raising young in cats. In general, much of the subject material was being repeated for each species of cat. I understand that not all cats can be generalized, however, I think that the &quot;exceptions&quot; to the general topic can have the information presented shortly, without the need to devote a whole section of the article to raising young, such as in the facts box. This'll also keep the pages consistent with each other. My two cents. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 05:24, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

== since when is 274 metres almost a mile ==

Needs correcting. 2 facts to include./

Other big cats chase only a few hundred meters, the cheetah chases 3.4 miles (5500 meters) at an average speed of 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour).

The top speed, 71 miles per hour (114 kilometers per hour), can usually be maintained for only 200-300 yards (274 meters).

      <comment>/* Commonly Used Oils */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Essential oil|Essential oils]] are strongly scented oils that are created through the distillation of plant materials. Most commonly derived from the flowers, leaves or stems of a plant, they may also be derived from fruit or the skin of a fruit. 
Many of these oils have common uses in aroma theory and alternative medicine. Beekeepers however, also may have a used for a select few of these common oils&lt;br&gt;
Essential oils can often be found in health food stores or aromatherapy shops, the price may be high, but keep in mind that a little oil will go a long way.

==Commonly Used Oils==
There exist a wider variety of essential oils. In general, beekeepers are only interested in a few of them. The following is a list of some of the more common oils that may concern a beekeeper.

;Banana:Though it has been unconfirmed, reports state that banana oil seems to closely mimic the [[Beekeeping/Pheromone#Alarm|alarm pheromone]] of honeybees. Because of this it is advised against using banana oil, or other strong banana scented products near or around hives. It is unclear whether bananas can be safely eaten near honey bees, but it is likely that no adverse result would be seen.

;Lemon Grass:[[w:Lemongrass|Lemongrass]] works conveniently as well as the pheromone created by the honeybee's [[Beekeeping/Pheromone#Nasonov|nasonov]] gland, also known as attractant pheromone. Because of this lemon grass oil can be used as a lure when [[Beekeeping/Trapping Swarms|trapping swarms]] or attempting to draw the attention of hived bees. Be warned, however, that lemon grass oil can cause a [[Beekeeping/Robbing Behavior|robbing behavior]] if it is used within or on a weak hive.

;Peppermint:[[w:Peppermint|Peppermint]] oil is used as a general-purpose pheromone masking scent. It does not apparently mimic any known bee pheromones and is simply used to mask others. In theory any other strong scented essential oil would work the same.

;Spearmint:[[w:Spearmint|Spearmint]] oil is often used in conjunction with [[#Lemon Grass|lemon grass oil]] during feeding to improve hive health and work as a recruiting scent. 

;Spearmint and Lemon Grass:[[#Spearmint|Spearmint oil]] and [[#Lemon Grass|lemon grass oil]] are two essential oils that are commonly used in conjunction to complete many tasks with bees. A simple [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#General Purpose Essential Oil Mixture| general purpose essential oil mixture]] can be used for many things, including avoiding the reliance on smoke when opening hives.

;Tea Tree:[[w:Tea tree|Tea Tree]] oil is often used in [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Grease Patty|grease patties]] for control of mites. It seems as if Tea Tree oil can be interchanged with [[#Wintergreen|wintergreen]] oil with no loss of effectiveness.

;Wintergreen:[[w:Wintergreen|Wintergreen]] oil is often used in [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Grease Patty|grease patties]] for control of mites. It seems as if Tea Tree oil can be interchanged with [[#Wintergreen|wintergreen]] oil with no loss of effectiveness.It also helps with Small Hive Beetles.

==Essential Oil Therapy Versus Mites==
===Varroa Mites===
Essential oils, in regards to mite control, have two apparent modes of operation, primarily, direct toxicity. In the case of [[Beekeeping/Parasites#Varroa Mites|varroa mites]], once a mite comes in to direct contact with an essential oils such as [[#Wintergreen|wintergreen]] or [[#Tea Tree|tea tree]] oil mixed into a [[Beekeeping/Recipes_for_the_Bees#Grease Patty|grease patty]] they are usually killed within a few minutes. This however, requires that the infected bee actually contact the grease patty. Due to this contact requirement, direct toxicity cannot eliminate mites, only aid in the control of mite levels. Secondly, it appears mite reproduction can be impaired when bees are fed a [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#Sugar Syrup| syrup]] containing essential oils. Essential oils are passed from feeding bees to other bees and larva through trophallaxis. Essential oils thereby pass to the brood and poison any female Varroa that attempt to parasitically feed on the larva.

===Tracheal Mites===
Similarly, essential oils appear to have an impact on the breeding and control of [[Beekeeping/Parasites#Tracheal Mites|tracheal mites]], however the effects of tracheal mites are difficult to observe and the mechanism that causes the control is in debate. It appears that the best therapy, in regards to tracheal mites and essential oils, is the usage of grease patties.

===Treatment===
It is recommended that that grease patties containing essential oils, and other medicaments as desired, are kept on the hives throughout the winter and any season when honey collection for human consumption is not taking place. Grease patties not containing any essential oils or medication should be kept on hives throughout the rest of the year. During times of the year that temperatures allow for flight, and honey is not to being collected for human consumption, colonies should be treated with syrup containing essential oils.

In the previous chapter on [[../Environmental_Response|environmental response]], we considered the various ways that individual organisms respond to the physical, chemical, and/or biological stimuli in their environment.  In this chapter, we will go deeper into the interactions between the biotic and the abiotic elements of the biosphere, focusing on the nonliving components. To begin to understand the physical &quot;home&quot; of our '''biosphere''', we first have to consider the physics of planet formation. From all we know about life in the universe, only planets can possibly offer conditions suitable for life. And indeed, since all life we know of occurs on just one planet, we need to develop an understanding of what is special or unique about our home planet.  How is the earth constituted; what is the nature of this &quot;stage&quot; upon which life developed and upon which life continues to play out. Presently, the &quot;ecology&quot; of other planets, if such a thing exists, is a subject of study within the science of '''exobiology'''.

Nutrients move through the ecosystem in biogeochemical cycles. A biogeochemical cycle is a circuit/pathway by which a chemical element moves through the biotic and the abiotic factors of an ecosystem. It is inclusive of the biotic factors, or living organisms, rocks, air, water, and chemicals.  The elements that are moving through the biotic or abiotic factors may be recycled, or they may be accumulated in a place called a '''sink/reservoir''' where they are held for a long period of time.  The amount of time that a chemical is held in one place is called '''residence'''.

All of the chemical elements in an organism are part of the biogeochemical cycle.  The chemicals travel not only through the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem, but they also travel through an organism.  The abiotic factors of an ecosystem include: (1) water (hydrosphere), (2) land (lithosphere), and (3) air (atmosphere).  All of the living factors that are found on Earth make up the biosphere.

===Nutrient Cycle Levels===
[[Image:Cellularrespiration.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Respiration can be both aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) and anaerobic (with out oxygen).]]
Nutrient cycles are broken up into three levels. There are '''global nutrient cycles''', which occur when ecosystems become linked on a global scale. This is now known as an ''Ecosphere''. On a smaller scale, there are '''local nutrient cycles'''. These cycles consist of the cycling that occurs in just one ecosystem. The smallest level includes '''common nutrient budgets and fluxes'''; some examples of this are carbon, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and other trace elements. All of these cycles can be linked so that a community can remain at equilibrium. All of these cycles are driven by microbes. Microbes contain 350-550 giga tons of the worlds carbon. They also contain 85-130 giga tons of nitrogen, along with 9-14 giga tons of phosphorus. Nitrogen is only fixed by bacteria and archea, and they fix 85% of the 15 giga tons of nitrogen every year.  Cyanobacteria are responsible for fixing 50% of the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Ecosphere.  There are also huge reserves of carbon locked up in rocks. Rocks contain 81 million gig tons of carbon, which is in the form of calcium carbonate (CaCo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), commonly called limestone. 

The processes that make up these cycles can be divided into two groups. The first group of processes all have an '''aerobic component'''. Through respiration, organic material can be converted into carbon dioxide. Respiration is done by animals, plants, and microbes. A second aerobic process is carbon fixation. This is the reverse of respiration where carbon dioxide is converted into organic material. The second group of processes are '''anaerobic processes'''. The first anaerobic process is fermentation. This is another way that organic material can be converted into carbon dioxide. Bacteria and fungi carry out this process when deprived of oxygen.  A second form of an anaerobic process is carbon fixation. The only organisms that fix carbon anaerobically are archea. The last anaerobic process is methanogenesis.  This process takes carbon dioxide and converts it into methane. This process is also only done by archea, but does not account for all methane because some methane can be made aerobically. 

[[Image:Nutrient-cycle_hg.png|thumb|450px|left|The Nutrient Cycle]]

There are two main types of systems on Earth, a closed system and an open system. A '''closed system''' occurs when the chemicals or elements used in an ecosystem are recycled instead of being lost. An '''open system''' occurs when the sun provides Earth with energy in the form of light which is usually used and then lost in the form of heat as it travels through the various trophic levels on Earth.

Although the biogeochemical cycles are complex and differ between the needs of nutrients by heterotrophs and autotrophs, there are three shared components of nutrient cycles: inputs, internal cycling, and outputs. Precipitation is one form of input, which brings appreciable quantities of nutrients into a cycle (Patterson, 1975). Microbes recycling dead organic material back into the system to be reused is a form of internal cycling. The export of nutrients must be offset by the input of nutrients into a system if there is to be no net loss. Carbon is exported from a cycle in the form of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via respiration of all living organisms.

The most important biogeochemical cycles are the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, oxygen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and the water cycle.  The biogeochemical cycles always have a state of equilibrium.  The state of equilibrium occurs when there is a balance in the cycling of the elements between compartments.  Ecologists may also be interested in the sulfur cycle, the nutrient cycle, and the hydrogen cycle; however, ecologists are more interested in studying the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and water cycles.

The term biogeochemical gets its name from the previous cycles listed above (abiotiv factors).  The prefix ''Bio'' refers to the biosphere.  ''Geo'' refers to the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere.  Chemical refers to the various chemicals that go through/travel through the biogeochemical cycles.

== Biogeochemical Cycles ==
[[Image:AYool GLODAP del pH.png|thumb|250px|left|global changes in earth's atmosphere]]
A '''biogeochemical cycle''' or inorganic-organic cycle is a circulating or repeatable pathway by which either a chemical element or a molecule moves through both biotic (&quot;bio-&quot;) and abiotic (&quot;geo-&quot;) compartments of an ecosystem. In effect, an element is chemically recycled, although in some cycles there may be places (called &quot;sinks&quot;) where the element accumulates and is held for a long period of time. In considering a specific biogeochemical cycle, we focus on a particular element and how that element participates in chemical reactions, moving between various molecular configurations. Of the 90-odd elements known to occur in nature, some 30 or 40 are thought to be required by living organisms (Odum, 1959). We will be considering only a few of these, mainly those utilized in fairly large quantities by living organisms. The principal elements of life are '''carbon''', '''hydrogen''', '''oxygen''', and '''nitrogen'''. However, a number of others are certainly important to understand as well, notably '''phosphorus''' and '''sulfur'''. Some &quot;non-essential&quot; elements participate in biogeochemical cycles, entering organism tissues because of chemical similarity to essential elements. For example, strontium can behave like calcium in the body.

=== Hydrologic Cycle (Water Cycle) ===

A very significant molecule (on planet Earth) that cycles through ecosystems is the water molecule (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), for the reason that life is so dependent on water as the medium of chemical reactions within cells. While it generally is the case that we discuss the water cycle in terms of the various states of water, at least some water molecules are taken up by plants and split apart (photolysed) into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen; the latter is released into the atmosphere as molecular oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Thus, by virtue of photosynthesizing organisms (''photoautotrophs''), the water cycle is an important part of both the oxygen and the hydrogen cycles. Note that hydrogen ends up as part of an organic molecule, and therefore a participant in the carbon cycle.

The majority of water in the water cycle is found within the oceans and the polar ice caps, although water is present in the bodies of organisms, in freshwater lakes and rivers, frozen in glaciers, and in the ground as groundwater. Water moves more or less freely between these storage reservoirs: by evaporation, by precipitation, and by runoff from the land. 

The sedimentation cycle is an extension of the hydrological cycle. The water carries material from the land to the ocean, where they are added as sediments. The sediment cycle includes the physical and chemical erosion, nutrient transport, and sediment formation from water flows. The sediment formed from water flows is mostly responsible for the buildup of sediments at the bottom of the ocean. The sediment cycle is tied in with the flow of six important elements, which are hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. These elements also known as macroelements make up 95 % of all living things. The balancing of these molecules is required to sustain life. These elements have to be recycled for life to continuously regenerate.

===Carbon Cycle===

[[Image:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Carbon is being released into the atmosphere.]]
Carbon is required for the building of all organic compounds. Carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is obtained from the atmosphere and transformed into a usable organic form by organisms. The reservoirs for the carbon cycle are the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide exists as a free gas, fossil organic deposits (such as oil and coal), and durable organic materials like cellulose. Mineral carbonates, such as limestone, are a significant geological sink for carbon. During the process of carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is taken up from the atmospheric reservoir (or from biocarbonates dissolved in water) by plants, photosynthetic bacteria, and algae and is &quot;fixed&quot; into organic substances. Animals obtain their requirements for carbon (as carbon-based molecules) by eating plants or other animals. For the biological links, the carbon cycle comes full cycle when carbon is released by either plants and animals as they respire or after life as they decompose. Organisms respire carbon dioxide as a waste product from the breakdown of organic molecules as their cells derive energy from oxidizing the molecules containing &quot;fixed&quot; carbon.  The burning of organic material such as wood or fuels also results in the release of carbon dioxide from organic carbon.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a trace gas and has huge effects on Earth’s heat balance by absorbing infrared radiation. During the growing season or summer, there is a decrease in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because increased sunlight and temperature helps plants increase their carbon dioxide uptake and growth. In the winter time, more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enters the atmosphere than can be removed by plants. This happens because plant respirations and the death of plants happens faster than photosynthesis. [[http://essp.csumb.edu/esse/climate/climatebiogeo.html| Life and Biogeochemical Cycles ]]

===Carbon Cycling Experiments===

The impact of land-cover and land-use change on global carbon cycle has been the focus of various studies. The Brazilian Legal Amazon has been an area of particular interest because of rapid forest clearing. In determining such an impact, models are often developed and used. In a study focusing on the net carbon flux caused by deforestation and forest re-growth over the period of 1970-1998, a processed-based model of forest growth, carbon cycling, and land-cover dynamics was developed. This model was named CARLUC (for CARbon and Land-Use Change). This model, in particular, was used to estimate the size of terrestrial carbon pools in terra firme (unflooded) across the Brazilian Legal Amazon and the net flux of carbon resulting from forest disturbance and forest recovery from disturbance {{ref|Hirsh 2004}}.    

As previously mentioned, carbon cycling is driven by both abiotic and biotc factors. Net carbon fluxes can be partitioned into assimilatory and respiratory components. The complex interplay between assimilatory and respiratory sources and their responsiveness to abiotic changes such as drought and temperature are poorly understood. In a recent study, net carbon partitioning was used to disentangle abiotic and biotic drivers of all component influencing the overall sink strength of a Mediterranean ecosystem during a rapid spring to summer transition (between May and June of 2006). It was ultimately determined that decreasing soil water availability rather than increasing air temperature largely affected both assimilation and respiration fluxes of understory plants and in consequence ecosystem respiration and soil respiration {{ref|Unger 2009}}.

===Nitrogen Cycle===
Nitrogen is required for the manufacturing of all amino acids and nucleic acids; however, the average organism can not use atmospheric nitrogen for these tasks and as a result is dependent on the nitrogen cycle as a source for its usable nitrogen. The nitrogen cycle begins with nitrogen stored in the atmosphere as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or nitrogen stored in the soil as ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), or nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen is assimilated into living organisms through three stages: nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and plant metabolism. Nitrogen fixation is a process which occurs in prokaryotes in which N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted to (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Atmospheric nitrogen can also undergo nitrogen fixation by lighting and UV radiation and become NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Following nitrogen fixation, nitrification occurs. During nitrification, ammonia is converted into nitrite, and nitrite is converted into nitrate. Nitrification occurs in various bacteria. In the final stage, plants absorb ammonia and nitrate and incorporate it into their metabolic pathways. Once the nitrogen has entered the plant metabolic pathway, it may be transferred to animals when the plant is eaten. Nitrogen is released back into the cycle when denitrifying bacteria convert NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; into N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process of denitrification, when detrivorous bacteria convert organic compounds back into ammonia in the process of ammonification, or when animals excrete ammonia, urea, or uric acid.

A lot of environmental problems are caused by the disruption of the nitrogen cycle by human activity some of the problems caused range from the production of troposperic (lower atmospheric) smog to the perturbation of stratospheric ozone and contamination of ground water. An example of one of the problems caused is the formation of greenhouse gas. Like carbon dioxide and water vapor greenhouse gas traps heat near the earth’s surface and destroys the stratospheric ozone. Once that occurs nitrous oxide in the earth’s atmosphere is broken down by UV light into nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide. These two products can reduce the ozone. Nitrogen oxides can be changed back into nitrates and nitrite compounds and recycled back into the earth’s surface.[[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/102/ecosystem.html| Environmental Biology - Ecosystems ]]  

===Global Carbon Cycle===

Carbon is continuously cycled between the oceans, land, and the atmosphere. The atmospheric carbon is primarily carbon dioxide. Carbon, on land, occurs primarily in living biota and decaying organic matter. Dissolved carbon dioxide and small organisms like plankton that store carbon dioxide are major sources in the ocean. Carbon is measured in Gigatons, with the deep ocean containing almost 40,000 Gt, compared to about 2,000 Gt on land and 750 Gt in the atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide, a known &quot;greenhouse gas&quot;, traps some of the radiation in the atmosphere that would be lost in space. This causes the atmosphere to be warmer than it would naturally be. Since pre-industrial times man-made emissions have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 30%. The increase in carbon dioxide causing global warming is important for us to understand so we can predict future implications concerning our planet.

Average global temperatures have increased this past century and are predicted to increase even more in the next century. In a study done by Parmesan ''etal'', the distribution and population dynamics of several species of butterflies were monitored in response to the increased temperatures. Migratory patterns of each species were observed and compared to previous patterns of distribution. The butterflies showed a northern shift which is thought to be a response to increased temperatures. Parmesan ''etal'' concluded that the current and future climate warming may be a big factor in shifting species distributions {{ref|Parmesan 199}}.

===Phosphorus, Iron, and Trace Mineral cycles===
The Phosphorus cycle is one of the slowest biogeochemical cycle.  It does not stay in the atmosphere, because it is normally in a liquid state at room temperature.  Phorsphorus mainly cycles through water, soil, and sediments.  The little phosphorus in the atmosphere is carried by dust particles and such.  Phosphate is most often in the form of phosphate salts, which is released from weathered rock and dissolved in ground water where plants take it up.  Phosphorus is a limiting factor for plants on land and in water, including the ocean because there is so little of it and it is not very soluble in water.  The cycle does speed up a little bit as it cycles through plants and animals.  When the plants and animals die and decay the phosphorus is returned to the soil and sediments and eventually locked back in the rock.

The iron cycle is similar to every other cycle.  It is, however, much more abundant than phosphorus.  One additional way iron gets cycled, besides rock weathering, is when a volcano erupts and sends an iron rich dust into the atmosphere and eventually spreading it in soil and water.

Other trace minerals, such as, zinc, copper, and manganese, were once thought to be just as abundant as nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen.  Their depletion is thought to be from water erosion of the soil and over cropping of land, they aren't able to replenish themselves as fast. To learn more about all the trace minerals essential to life visit:[http://www.inspiredliving.com/health/a~traceminerals.htm| Nutrients - Trace Minerals]

=== &quot;Perfect&quot; Cycles ===
Odum (1959) describes what are called more or less &quot;perfect&quot; cycles: biogeochemical cycles that involve equilibrium states. That is, there exists in nature a balance in the cycling of the element between various compartments, with the element or material moving into abiotic compartments about as fast as it moves into biotic compartments. Certain ecosystems may experience &quot;shortages&quot;, but overall a balance exists on a global scale.

II. Deserts are characterized by their limited precipitation.  Deserts have a brief rainy season which on average produces less than 30 cm rainfall per year. Deserts are mainly located at 30 degrees North and South latitude because of its dry air resulting from the Hadley cell (please read interlink below on a Hadley cell), which stretches between the equator and 20 to 35 degrees North and South latitude.  

Deserts have the capacity to be very productive climates because they are in a high energy input area of the round earth (please refer to chapter 3 about solar irradiation and the earth being round), but are limited by their low precipitation.  Desert flora or plant life is located on only 10% of desert area.  They consist of mainly annuals that grow and reproduce during the brief rainy season.  The main flora are succulents that store water, have waxy cuticles to prevent water loss, they may have few modified small leaves or needles, and have large shallow root systems. 

III.  Chaparrals are desert types located in the mediterranean area.  Chaparrals are characterized by its distinct rainy season and more so by its extremes.  Summer temperatures can reach a high of approximately 40 degrees Celsius and winter temperatures an reach a low of approximately -15 degrees Celsius.  Plants and animals inhabitats are drought adapted to aide survival. Plant life are similar in characteristics to desert plants with mainly shrub/brush type species.

== Soil ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil '''Soil''']is the foundation for terrestrial systems.  It is a mixture of organic (living and nonliving) and inorganic material.  The organic part is contributed by plants, animals, and microbes.  The inorganic part is a result of weathering.

===Soil Layering===
Soil is a composition of many different layers.  The first(top) layer is the '''O Horizon''' which is then compsed of 2 sublayers the O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; layers.  The O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the intact organic layer which is made up of dead organic matter and leaf litter.  The O&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is contains mostly humus and is situated next to the A Horizon.  The entire O Horizon is about 10cm deep.  Deserts usually lack the O Horizon. 

The next layer is the '''A Horizon'''.  This is what most consider the topsoil, it is a mixture of weathered rock(clay, sand, and silt) from lower layers and organic material from the O Horizon.  This is the area where there are the most roots, microbes, and invertebrates.  This horizon usually has a high respiration rate, and has most of the nutrients leeched to lower layers by water.  The top 2 layers combined (O and A Horizons) are on average about 0.5m deep.  

The next layer is the '''E Horizon''' (or Eluviation Horizon).  This layer has the least amount of dissolved nutrients.  This layer can have a clay pan formed at the bottom which is highly compacted clay which prevents weathering of rock below.  The also prevents tap roots from reaching the C Horizon.  This may also cause the area above to become water-logged.  

Below the E horizon is the Illuviation Horizon of '''B Horizon'''.  This is the area where leechates collect, and most tap roots exist.  It is usually mineral rich and contains little organic material.  It is usually about 0.5m deep. 
Below the B Horizon is the '''C Horizon''', which is the lowest soil, layer is commonly called the subsoil.  This is mostly weathered parent material.  This is usually about 0.5m deep also.

Lastly is the inorganic material of the soil or the '''R Horizon'''.  This is also called bedrock which is a result of weathering from wind, water, temperature, and plants.

===Particle Size===
[[Image:Differences in the size of sand.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Different sizes of particles in sand]]

The particle size of soil is correlated to the amount of surface area of the particles and the charge of the surface area.  A decrease in particle size equals an increase in surface area which in turn equals an increase in a negative charge of the surface area.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) designates types of soil by the size of the particles in the soil. Clay consists of particles smaller than 0.002mm and has the largest water capacity and highest nutrient capacity.  Silt consists of particles smaller than 0.05mm and has a relatively median water capacity and a median nutrient capacity.  Sand consists of particles smaller than 2mm and has the smallest water capacity and the lowest nutrient capacity.

===Acidic Soil===

Acidic soil is any type of soil that has a low pH. It is created whenever soil is very low in minerals and may be created by conifer needles. Amino acids also breaks down clay.  The breakdown of clay is done by leeching the minerals out of the soil. This leeching of minerals is due to a high Hydronium ion [H+] concentration which results of in less productive soil. Acid rain or precipitation that is unusually acidic because of emissions of sulfur and nitrogen compounds which react with the atmosphere is widely believed to be responsible for acidifying soil.

== Factors and Primes ==

'''Factors''' are numbers that you can multiply together to get another number. 
For example: 8 and 11 are factors of 88 as 8 x 11 = 88.
Similarly, 10 is a factor of 100 as 10 x 10 is 100.

'''Prime factors''' are factors which are '''prime numbers'''
 55  = 5 x 11
 100 = 2 x 5 x 2 x 5

Because 2, 5, and 11 cannot be divided by any number but 1 and itself, these numbers are called ''prime''. Prime numbers are an important part of mathematics, and the problem of factoring large numbers into primes remains fundamental to the study of computer science.
Factoring a number like 64 often requires more than one step:

 64  = 2 x 32 (32 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 16 (16 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 2 x 8 (8 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 4 (4 is not prime)
  or = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2

&lt;[[Theoretical_Mechanics/Cover|Cover and Inter-Wiki]]
Mechanics is some of the essential part of our life and physics

==Contents==
* [[/Vector Algebra/]]
Most of the math in mechanics involves vectors, understanding them is essential for understanding mechanics. This section covers the basics of vector math.
*[[/Statics/]]
Statics is about balance. It studies the relations between different bodies at rest.

===Forces And Their Effects===

====Force====
A force is an interaction between 2 objects. If there aren't 2 (or more) objects there can't be a force. The objects do not necesarrily have to touch. e.g. Gravity, electromagnetic and electrostatic forces.

A force is represented by a vector: the magnitude represents the magnitude of the force; The direction represents the direction in which the force acts; the origin defines where the forces acts on the object.

====Effects Of Forces====
A net force acting on an object can have five effects: tension, compression, shear, translation or rotation. 

Note that this translation is according to Aristotelian Physics which is founded on the belief ii that something moves, it must have a mover, i.e. force causing change in position. This is not true according to Newtonian physics in which force changes the velocity of an object.         

=====Translation=====
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Transl.png|none|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;Translation of a rectangle&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

*The object moves in a direction parallel to itself.
*The effect is defined by the magnitude and direction of the acting force.
*A is the object at its original position.
*A' and &lt;nowiki&gt;A''&lt;/nowiki&gt; are the object translated along respectively the X- and the Y-axis.
&lt;nowiki&gt;A'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the object translate along both axis.

=====Rotation=====
[[File:Rotation of a rectangle.png|center|thumb|250px|Rotation of a rectangle]]

*The object rotates around a point.
*:The original rectangle (left) is rotated around its center. The result is displayed to the right. The dotted rectangle show the location of the original rectangle.
*The object rotates around an axis.
*:E.g. A door. Imagine a line through the hinges, this is the axis. The door rotates around this axis.

=====Translation and Rotation=====
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Tran rot.png|none|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;translation and Rotation of a rectangle&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;/center&gt;

*The object doesn't move parallel nor does it rotate around a fixed point or axle.

==Kinematics==
Kinematics describes the position, speed and acceleration of a point or a body and the relations between them without regard to the cause of the acceleration.

==Dynamics==
Dynamics connects statics with kinematics by connecting the cause (forces) with the effect (acceleration). This is where the three laws of Newton fit in.

As well as the Newtonian laws, there are other formulations of mechanics; Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. These formulations of mechanics focus more on energy than force.

I have created a few templates for writing ASM instructions:

*[[Template:x86-inst]]
*[[Template:x86-inst-1]]
*[[Template:x86-inst-2]]

Which will display assembly instructions with 0, 1 and 2 operands, respectfully. 

* [[Template:x86_Assembly_Page]]

This template goes at the top of every page in the book, for uniformity.

* [[Template:x86 Assembly Stub]]

This template marks a page in this book as being a stub.

== Overhaul ==

I've completely overhauled this page, and moved the information into neat subpages which are more manageable. I have also moved the page from &quot;Programming:x86 Assembly&quot; to simply [[x86 Assembly]], and have instituted the &quot;forward-slash&quot; naming convention for subpages. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:09, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

== Ask for Help ==

Would someone please work on this page. It's a good quick start guide at most right now, but to a newcomer to assembly like myself, it gives little info. The the example for mov for instance is more advanced than what is previously talked about. There isn't any details about syntax before that point. I get the gist of it, but it would be better for someone to add a section before that some time which gives a very basic program and gives details of what each line does and if it's always needed or platform specific (say from Windows to Linux to 16 bit Dos even.)

--[[User:HarleyL|HarleyL]] 13:42, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)

When I came to this book a month ago seeking to learn NASM, I didn't get much out of it. When I returned recently, I realized there is a fair bit of info here, but it's mostly in a reference book format. What do people think about turning section 2 into the big thrust -making lesson plans for each of the mentioned assemblers- and then moving the rest to the back as appendices?
[[User:Gabriel Lein|Gabriel Lein]] 15:05, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

In [[X86 Assembly/X86 Architecture#Addressing_modes]], what is the difference between base displacement and direct offset addressing?


In section 2.2 x86 instruction set although the book mentions both styles of syntax it does not make clear which syntax the examples are using, although the comments sometimes make this clear it would be worthwhile to have a note at the start of the section or with each example stating which syntax is used. 

Also in the examples the instructions are suffixed with the size of operand (l, b or w) which although improves readability it generates confusion for beginners because those features appear to be GNU (GAS) specific and may not work in their respective assembler a quick note about this would alleviate the confusion.

== Reverse Engineering Wikibook ==

I have added some links from the book I've been working on, [[Reverse Engineering]] to point to this page. It would be nice if this book was beefed up a little bit, and maybe if it included at least some info on Intel syntax as well, because the RE book uses mostly Intel. If nobody else jumps on to this task, i might work on it some myself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 01:27, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== Other resources ==

I'm not sure if anyone is interested, but there is a guide on the same topic at http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/. downloadable as PDF or POSTSCRIPT, 195 pages long.

== Order of second byte ==

I have done some study recently via ICY Hexplorer and an x86 ASM help file, and I noticed that for the second byte whoever wrote it had it somewhat reversed. It was originally Mod-Reg-R/M, whereas it's actually Mod-R/M-Reg, so I changed it to be so, as well as changed the hexadecimal representation of it. I hope nobody minds, as I just found an error and had to correct it.

== Context switching? ==

Some information on context switching would be interesting [[User:69.31.174.216|69.31.174.216]] 21:54, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Print this string&quot; MBR / GNU AS? ==
I use GNU AS (+&quot;objcopy -O binary&quot; to get raw content) and because here sadly isn't any mbr examples for it here and this place feels so awkwardly quiet anyway that I just have to say something I'll bother you with this question I might solve myself too. So, I have the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
.code16
Start:	xor %bh, %bh;
	mov $0xe, %ah;
	mov String, %si;

Print:	movb %cs:(%bp, %si), %al;
	cmp %al, '\0;
	je Infin;
	int $0x10;
	inc %si;
	jmp Print;

Infin:	jmp Infin;

String:	.ascii	&quot;Insert string here\0&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem is that the label addresses aren't based on 0x7c00 and I don't know what to do to get them so. Also, is there some shorter way of doing this? --[[Special:Contributions/212.149.216.233|212.149.216.233]] ([[User talk:212.149.216.233|talk]]) 15:30, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

: You need one conditional branch to exit the loop.
: You also need a branch at the end of the loop to return to the top of the loop.
: Does that mean you need two branch instructions in the loop?
: Often assembly language programmers put the conditional branch at the end of the loop -- then they only need one branch instruction in the loop, rather than two.
: Smart assembly language programmers use subroutines that have already been written and tested.
: Does the following example answer your questions? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:54, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright of intel - amd developers manuals. ==

Hi. I'm writing a x86 assembly manual for [http://el.wikibooks.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82_%CF%83%CE%B5_%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_%CE%B3%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CF%83%CE%B1_(GNU_%CF%83%CF%85%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1_-_%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE_x86) el.wikibooks].

Of the more than two million known species of [[w:insects| insects]], honeybees have been the subject of more studies than all of the rest combined. Man has invested many uncountable hours learning the ways of the honeybee. Much of this time was not spent in a laboratory, studying the bee as an organism for the sake of science. Rather this time was invested because honeybees, due to their products including honey and wax, were, and still are great commodities. The intertwining of the history of man and bee is rich in both lore and science. It was said by [[w:Democritus| Democritus]] that bees could be created from the specially prepared carcass of a beaten ox. This obviously is not true, but it is a good example of the lengths people would go to create a healthy productive colony of bees.
Honeybees are included as one of the few insects which are [[w:colony (biology)|colonial]], this group also includes some species of wasps, ants, and termites. Honeybees, though they have a feral counterpart, are often maintained by farmers similarly to any other product bearing livestock. Honeybees are a subset of [[w:bee|bees]] which fall into the Order [[w:Hymenoptera| Hymenoptera]] and Suborder [[w:Apocrita| Apocrita]]. Of the roughly 20,000 known species of bee, four are classed as honeybees including ''[[w:Apis florae| Apis Florae]]'', ''[[w:Apis dorsata| Apis Dorsata]]'', ''[[w:Apis Cerana| Apis Cerana]]'', and ''[[w:Apis Mellifera| Apis Mellifera]]''.  The Western Honeybee (Apis Mellifera) is the most commonly kept bee within Europe and the Americas.

==Honey Production==
Bees have become the great interest of many, almost wholly due to the fact that they produce honey. Being less than twenty percent water, honey cannot support yeast, bacteria or microorganisms and is therefore a form of sugar that is completely resistant to spoiling. Honey is created by the refinement of nectar that the bees must collect from flowers. Once created, the majority of the honey is used as the main food source for the hive. Any extra honey can be harvested by the beekeeper and used for many tasks.

==Life Cycle==
The life cycle of a honeybee exists in three distinct independent stages. After hatching from [[Beekeeping/Egg| egg]], the bee exists initial as a [[Beekeeping/Larva| larval]] form. Soon after the larval form, the secondary stage as [[Beekeeping/Pupae| pupae]] is reached. Finally the pupae develop into the adult bee. The adult bee may take the form of a [[Beekeeping/Worker| worker]], a [[Beekeeping/Drone| drone]], or a [[Beekeeping/Queen| queen bee]]. It is common for worker bees to live up to nine days if their main task in life is heavy foraging. Conversely, workers that do menial tasks in the hive will survive for around three weeks. Losing a forager from time to time does not have a crucial impact on the overall well being of the hive. A strong beehive has between ten and twenty thousand foragers at any given time. The queen also possesses the ability to replace any lost bees by laying up to 2,000 eggs a day. Developing [[Beekeeping/Brood| brood]], depending on the season and race of bee, can fill up to a full third of the hive.

==Tasks==
Bees have the nearly unique task of keeping the world alive. Bees are the main factors within flower pollination. Without pollination, plants would be unable to reproduce and thereby would not be present for nourishing other animals within the food chain. Evolving from wasps nearly 100 million years ago, bees have become quite specialized in the tasks that they need to complete.

Programming architecture is an amazing thing. Some architecture forms are incredibly complex, requiring years of practice to effectively master. Other forms require little or no previous development experience, making this category the best option for beginners. Please note that this discussion centers upon general development theory and not language or platform-specific technologies. Such information is critical to your success as a developer but a foundation must be laid in the mindset of what it means to develop software as a programmer before venturing beyond the general in search of the specific language(s) of your choice, depending upon your goals, needs, and existing skill set(s). Here are a few simple concepts to remember about programming in general:


== Logic ==
Logic is more than geometry, as that math subject is where the majority of individuals discover ancient concepts that still dominate our thought processes today. Logic is an orderly definable process that arrives at a conclusion using pre-determined rules agreed upon by all related parties. I define logic in this light as it is the center point of all development. Without logic, creating the desired software logic in a way that could be interpreted by a computer of any kind would remain an impossible task. Thus, logic lays a foundation upon which both man (humans) and machine (computers) agree to operate on the same playing field. This is one of the greatest tensions in application development, as software bugs often arise from a miscommunication in the area of logic. 
For example, if the developer/programmer desires X functionality, and mistaking codes the logic in a way that the computer interprets as Y functionality, the developer/programmer (I will continue to use these two terms interchangeably) must re-evaluate his code to see where his thought process (logically speaking) did not line up with the computer's interpretation of that process. One of the most frequent headaches for new developers stems from the fact that it is easier to visualize the software functionality in a creative way than it is to interpret that concept into an orderly series of commands, requests, and other functions required to build what the individual desires. I will deal with creativity next, but suffice it to say that programming is one of those few trades that will always be an artform and a science at the same time. For this reason, a programmer just beginning to develop software must learn to search out the uncommon answers (creativity) while keeping his/her feet planted firmly on the ground (logic) to make the desired functionality a reality.

== Creativity ==
Creativity is the second-most important asset a developer can bring to the table when writing new software. It is a system of thought processes meshing together that generate new options for solving unique development challenges. No developer truly worth his salt can exist in this industry without learning to open his mind to new ways of thought, expression, and recognition. Indeed, it is the personal belief of the original author that a lack of creativity hinders the potential of every programmer who doesn't learn the power achieved in overcoming the 'box' syndrome. 
Simply stated, programmers are notorious for thinking inside the realm of what has been discovered, mapped, and utilized by a predecessor or associate, resulting in an imaginary space called the 'box'. It is in this box that the developer works, associates meaning, and derives solutions. The mark of a talented developer is the innate (or learned) ability to dynamically resize or reconfigure the 'box' in him/her to meet the unique programming challenge at hand. Breaking outside the barriers of the box is daunting, as it requires a perspective that may not exist within the developer himself/herself. A wise person once said, 'When you stop learning, you stop leading.' I humbly modify this statement for the purposes of software development and say, 'When you stop learning, you stop the flow of software innovation.' Achieving results in a fixed box may work for a time, perhaps even years if the box is significantly developed. However, the nature of the programming trade stipulates constant learning for the purpose of maintaining an edge in the industry.
I'm focusing on the 'box' concept as it is truly impossible, I believe, to impart true learning in the area of creativity. It must be experienced for yourself, as you begin to think about your world from many different perspectives. If you choose to develop software for others as an [[w:ISV|ISV]] (independent software vendor) or system integrator, you will need to hold interviews with every type of user your software will service. Getting into the minds of others and discovering their wants and needs in terms of software functionality is the most rewarding, and yet oftentimes most challenging, aspect of being a programmer. Embrace alternate perspectives and alternate learning approaches to bring more mental collateral to the table that will enhance your creative edge.

== Abstraction ==
Abstraction, simply put, is the number of layers sitting between you and the underlying hardware you’re targeting in the development cycle. For example, an ASIC developer writing software mapping for a video chipset operates at an incredibly different level of abstraction than a script developer for web-enabled applications. These are two separate worlds for many reasons, but in fact the web-enabled application developer may indirectly utilize the chipset writer’s codebase if he references a graphical component on a system having that chipset deployed. Always remember that a high level of abstraction means the software functionality sits on top of many layers of logic ‘plumbing’ in comparison to low-level abstraction that sits directly on top of the hardware in use. Developers often gravitate to the abstraction level that best fits their present skills and abilities, but don’t let complex programming at a low-level of abstraction scare you from attempting to develop software in that space. Find a beginning niche and work your way toward a desired level of expertise in the area that fits your desire and needs best.

Some of the transliterations and indeed the roots themselves written in the Devanagari are incorrect.  For instance, the Sanskrit word for the number nine is transliterated as &quot;nav&quot; although it is written in the Devanagari as &quot;nava&quot;; and the root for English &quot;foot&quot; is not written with a long 'a' as the middle vowel, as it should be.

Let's make some progress with this page, huh?

Why not just take a public domain textbook like Macdonell's A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, and put the whole thing on-line.


Congratulations and Thanks for your efforts to preserve/create content about Sanskrit here. One of the oldest and the most scientific languages of this world, and a gateway into great literary texts. I am slightly familiar with Sanskrit (and fully with Hindi). I hope to contribute what ever I can to this text. 

Congrats on again and you are doing an excellent work - [[User:Chaturganj|Pankaj]]

== for grammarians only? ==

I think some of these lessons could be made more accessible. Don't worry, i know that sanskrit is extremely complex and difficult, but as far as i can tell the lesson on nouns and 'basic grammar' just sort of throws the case terms at people (Nom., Acc., Inst., etc.) without any explanation of their uses (not to mention things like (Erg./Abs.) that only linguistics buffs and nerds like me would understand upon seeing them without a great deal of explanation). You have done a very nice job so far, however, and i'd like to extend my complements. I'd like to add explanations for the grammatical terms, but need to know how to best make it fit the format and work with somebody who knows more about their particular uses in Sanskrit, as I only know them on a general level. Good luck in expanding it.

== Basic noun forms ==
Hello, this is my first edit.  I am not too familiar with Sanskrit, however I feel that a simple set of 'vibhaktee's from more than just one gender ought to be uploaded.  
Also, the current verb matrix contains only the suffixes for the present.  
Over the next few days, I will try to add some new material.  Since I have no idea how Wikibooks works, I just hope I don't break the tubes.  Please bear with me.

As a final note, I am not a linguist and have no idea what datives, ablatives and genitives are.  I will try to make these lessons as simple as possible, but due to my very limited Sanskrit education my lessons won't include much.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Beekeeping hive tool.jpg|thumb|right|10&quot; Hive Tool]]
==Usage==
;Hive tools can be used for
:*loosening [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]] and [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]].
:*scraping off excess bur comb or propolis from hive parts.
:*removing a bee sting from the body
;Hive tools, when jointly used for beekeeping, should not be used for
:*Mixing paint, varnish or chemicals

==Selecting a Design==
There exist multiple designs of hive tools, but in truth most any kind of pry bar with a blade will work. If you find that money is burning a hole in your pocket, feel free to invest in a high quality Teflon coated hive tool that would likely outlast any beekeeper.
Hive tools generally come in 7 and 10-inch varieties. If possible, before purchasing, see how the tool fits in your hand, and buy the one you are most comfortable with. Although it may not seem like an issue, the color of your hive tool may be important. If possible, purchase a brightly colored hive tool or paint it such. A brightly colored hive tool will stand out a lot better when dropped. It is rather difficult to continue working if you lose your tool.

==Purchasing==
Hive tools are sold by nearly every [[Beekeeping/Manufactures and Resources| bee keeping supply house]], but similar items can be found at most every hardware store. Simply look for a quality scraper/nail puller type of tool.

==Maintenance==
*It is advisable to sharpen the blade of a hive tool when needed. It is difficult to predict the intervals when such would need to be done, but most beekeepers do so at least once a year.
*If a hive tool is used on a hive that may be infected by disease it is often advisable to clean the tool by flame.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavTechnique}}
== Origins and reasoning ==
The original horn had no valves. The technique for playing notes between the open partials of the harmonic series was opening and closing the throat of the bell with the hand. When valves were added to the instrument, horn players opted to keep the hand in the bell. They had three primary reasons for doing so:
#The tone is darkened significantly, recreating the timbre of the Natural Horn.
#Pitches are more easily controlled. The deeper the hand goes into the bell, the lower the pitch.
#The hand is in place to perform extended techniques like ''stopped'' and ''echo horn''.

== Steps in putting hand in the bell correctly ==
=== The American method ===
#Assemble right hand as though it is going to be shaking another hand.
#Bring the thumb in so it points in the same direction as the other fingers.
#Place the hand inside the bell with the metal touching the back of the hand.

Some of the weight of the horn should be held up by the thumb and possibly the index-finger.

=== The French method ===
#Hold right hand out flat with palm down and drop thumb to create a 90-degree angle with fingers.
#Place the hand inside the bell until the thumb hits the bottom wall of the bell.

Some of the weight of the horn should be held up by the first knuckles and the back of the hand.

If you experiment with both of these positions, you will quickly learn how much the placement of the hand in the bell affects the overall timbre and volume of the instrument.

== Miscellaneous Information ==

The hand should certainly &quot;disrupt&quot; the sound coming out of the bell. Otherwise, there would be no point to having the hand it the bell. However, the hand should not be disturbing the sound enough to cause it to sound stuffy.

Visually depicted, one should imagine as though sound is emerging as a stream of water and the palm is carefully guiding the stream along the back of the forearm.

'''Korean pronouns''' pose some difficulty to speakers of English due to their complexity.  The Korean language makes extensive use of speech levels and honorifics in its grammar, and Korean pronouns also change depending on the social distinction between the speaker and the person or persons spoken to.

In general, Korean speakers avoid using second person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms. This is done in several ways:
* Omit the subject if it can be implied by the context. Most English sentences need subjects, but note Korean sentences do not.
* Use the appropriate title. For example, talking to a teacher or certain other professionals (e.g. a manager), one may use 선생님 (''seonsaengnim'', &quot;teacher&quot;).
* Use kinship terms, even to address someone who is not family:
** [[wikt:언니|언니]] (''eonni'', &quot;older sister&quot;), used by females to address a slightly elder female
** [[wikt:누나|누나]] (''nuna'', &quot;older sister&quot;), used by males to address a slightly elder female
** [[wikt:오빠|오빠]] (''oppa'', &quot;older brother&quot;), used by females to address a slightly elder male
** [[wikt:형|형]] (''hyeong'', &quot;older brother&quot;), used by males to address a slightly elder male
** [[wikt:아줌마|아줌마]] (''ajumma'', &quot;middle aged woman&quot;)
** [[wikt:아저씨|아저씨]] (''ajeoshi'', &quot;middle aged man&quot;)
** [[wikt:할머니|할머니]] (''halmeoni'', &quot;grandmother&quot;)
** [[wikt:할아버지|할아버지]] (''harabeoji'', &quot;grandfather&quot;)
* Use the plural [[wikt:여러분|여러분]] (''yeoreobun'', &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot;) where applicable.
* If talking to someone younger than the speaker, one may use the person's name.

|}

The first and second person pronouns have both an informal and a polite (humble/honorific) form. The polite form is used when speaking to someone older or of high social status. 당신 (the plain second person singular pronoun) literally means &quot;friend&quot;, but is only used as a form of address and is more polite than 친구 (''chingu''), the usual word for &quot;friend&quot;. 당신 is also sometimes used as the Korean equivalent of &quot;dear&quot; as a form of address. Also, whereas uses of other humble forms are straightforward, 당신 must be used only in specific social contexts, such as between two married couples. In that way it can be used in an ironic sense when used between strangers.

Of the third person pronouns, the feminine forms sound awkward and are mostly used when translating texts from other languages. 그 was originally used for both genders and still is in conversation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Beekeeping smoker.jpg|thumb|right|Smoker]]

==Usage==
Smokers are likely one of the most important tools that a beekeeper should have with them. A smoker has two main purposes. Primarily a smoker will encourage bees to engorge on honey. Encouraging honey engorging is beneficial as bees with stomachs filled with honey (or nectar) are unable to easily sting. The exact reasoning for this engorging behavior is unknown, though it likely evolved as a means of saving as much of the viable hive products by moving them in the case of a forest fire. Secondly the smoke produced from a smoker can mask scents and [[Beekeeping/Pheromones| pheromones]]. Most importantly it hides the alarm scent administered by [[Beekeeping/Guarding Behavior| guard bees]] and the alarm scent present during a sting.

===Lighting a Smoker===
#Open the smoker and clear it of any debris.
#Insert a loosely crumbled piece of newspaper or similar kindling. If necessary push it to the bottom of the smoker with your [[Beekeeping/Hive Tool|hive tool]].
#With a long nosed lighter or long match ignite the kindling.
#Be sure the kindling is sufficiently in flame with a few long slow bellows pumps. 
#Slowly add your larger kindling or smoker fuel and pump the bellows to ignite. If necessary, stoke the fire with your hive tool.
#After the kindling is properly on fire, which may take 5 or 10 minutes, begin slowly adding your smoker fuel.
#Continue pumping the bellows as you add fuel no more than &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the maximum capacity of the smoker. Over filling the smoker only insures that you will spit ash and ember as you work the hive.

; Proper smoker fuels
:*burlap rags, cotton rags, cotton string or twine
:*Woodchips, pine needles, twigs, sticks, dried leaves and grass
:*Stove pellets
:*Charcoal &lt;small&gt;(burns long and hot, may be best to use with other fuel)&lt;/small&gt;
:*Tobacco

; Improper smoker fuels
:*poison ivy, poison sumac, etc
:*insulation material
:*plastic or rubber
:*newspaper &lt;small&gt;(as sole fuel source)&lt;/small&gt;
:*greasy rags

==Selecting a Smoker==
Smokers commonly come in tin and stainless steel varieties in the sizes of 4x7 inches, 4x10 inches. Often options such as shields, finger guards and bellow material are also available. As a rule, steel smokers last longer than tin when well cared for. Shields and finger guards are not necessary, though they do tend to be helpful in preventing minor burns. Guarded smokers often also have a hook to allow the smoker to be hung from an open hive. Bellow material also does not matter much, most commonly there are options for leather and wood or plastic and rubber, both function the same, the rubber is simply less authentic.

==Purchasing==
When purchasing a smoker buy the largest you can afford, preferably made of steel. Smaller smokers by virtue of their size have a smaller reservoir and thereby don’t burn as long or with as much smoke as their larger cousins. 

==Maintenance==
*Steel smokers can occasionally be scoured with steel wool to remove cooked on soot and tar. If you would prefer you can also clean a smoker with a torch by simply burning the stuck on tar until it becomes ash.

==Tips==
*If a bee stings you or your gear apply a liberal amount of smoke to the area (after removing the stinger) to mask the alarm odor.
*Practice with a smoker before actually needing to use it, you will appreciate the ability to create a large masking cloud of smoke for a quick get away when things become difficult.
*By placing a properly sized, heavily perforated tin can, such as one which soup or fruit comes in, in side the smoker you can create a nice fire pan. The perforations allow for better air intake and easier lighting.

      <comment>When using ||= operator, the assignment is only evaluated if the variable is falsy (or non-existent). x || x = &quot;default&quot; is still not exactly right, but closer. See ref.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Operators ==
=== 1. Assignment ===

Assignment in Ruby is done using the equal operator &quot;=&quot;. This is both for variables and objects, but since strings, floats, and integers are actually objects in Ruby, you're always assigning objects.

Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  myvar = 'myvar is now this string'
  var = 321
  dbconn = Mysql::new('localhost','root','password')
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Self assignment'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = 1           #=&gt;1
  x += x          #=&gt;2
  x -= x          #=&gt;0
  x += 4          #=&gt;x was 0 so x= + 4 # x is positive 4
  x *= x          #=&gt;16
  x **= x         #=&gt;18446744073709551616 # Raise to the power
  x /= x          #=&gt;1
&lt;/source&gt;

A frequent question from C and C++ types is &quot;How do you increment a variable? Where are ++ and -- operators?&quot;
In Ruby, one should use x+=1 and x-=1 to increment or decrement a variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = 'a'
  x.succ!         #=&gt;&quot;b&quot; : succ! method is defined for String, but not for Integer types
&lt;/sourcE&gt;

'''Multiple assignments'''

Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  var1, var2, var3 = 10, 20, 30
  puts var1           #=&gt;var1 is now 10
  puts var2           #=&gt;var2 is now 20,var3...etc
  
  myArray=%w(John Michel Fran Doug) # %w() can be used as syntactic sugar to simplify array creation
  var1,var2,var3,var4=*myArray
  puts var1           #=&gt;John
  puts var4           #=&gt;Doug

  names,school=myArray,'St. Whatever'
  names               #=&gt;[&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Michel&quot;, &quot;Fran&quot;, &quot;Doug&quot;]
  school              #=&gt;&quot;St. Whatever&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Conditional assignment'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = find_something() #=&gt;nil
  x ||= &quot;default&quot;      #=&gt;&quot;default&quot; : value of x will be replaced with &quot;default&quot;, but only if x is nil or false
  x ||= &quot;other&quot;        #=&gt;&quot;default&quot; : value of x is not replaced if it already is other than nil or false
&lt;/source&gt;

Operator ||= is a shorthand form that closely resembles the expression:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rubyinside.com/what-rubys-double-pipe-or-equals-really-does-5488.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
 x || x = &quot;default&quot; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Operator ||= can be shorthand for code like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = &quot;(some fallback value)&quot; unless respond_to? :x or x
&lt;/source&gt;

In same way &amp;&amp;= operator works:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
  x = get_node() #=&gt;nil
  x &amp;&amp;= x.next_node #=&gt; nil : x will be set to x.next_node, but only if x is NOT nil or false
  x = get_node() #=&gt;Some Node
  x &amp;&amp;= x.next_node #=&gt;Next Node
&lt;/source&gt;

Operator &amp;&amp;= is a shorthand form of the expression:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot; line&gt;
 x = x &amp;&amp; x.get_node()
&lt;/source&gt;

== Scope ==

In Ruby there's a local scope, a global scope, an instance scope, and a class scope.

=== Local Scope ===

Example:
  var=2
  4.times do |x| 
    puts x=x*var
  end  
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;0,2,4,6&lt;/font&gt;
  puts x &lt;span style=&quot;color: #007700;&quot;&gt;#=&gt;undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object (NameError)&lt;/span&gt;

This error appears because this x(toplevel) is not the x(local) inside the do..end block the x(local) is a local variable to the block, whereas when trying the puts x(toplevel) we're calling a x variable that is in the top level scope, and since there's not one, Ruby protests.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Global scope ===

  4.times do |var|
    $global=$global*var
  end  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;0,2,4,6 last assignment of $global is 6&lt;/font&gt;
  puts $global
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 6&lt;/font&gt;
This works because prefixing a variable with a dollar sign makes the variable a global.

=== Instance scope ===

Within methods of a class, you can share variables by prefixing them with an @.

  class A
    def setup
      @instvar = 1
    end
    def go
      @instvar = @instvar*2
      puts @instvar
    end
  end
  instance = A.new
  instance.setup
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 2&lt;/font&gt;
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 4&lt;/font&gt;

=== Class scope ===

A class variable is one that is like a &quot;static&quot; variable in Java.  It is shared by all instances of a class.

  class A
    @@classvar = 1
    def go
      @@classvar = @@classvar*2
      puts @@classvar
    end
  end
  instance = A.new
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 2&lt;/font&gt;
  instance = A.new
  instance.go
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 4 -- variable is shared across instances&lt;/font&gt;


Here's a demo showing the various types:

 $variable
  class Test
    def initialize(arg1='kiwi')
      @instvar=arg1
      @@classvar=@instvar+' told you so!!'
      localvar=@instvar
    end
    def print_instvar
      puts @instvar
    end
    def print_localvar
      puts @@classvar
      puts localvar
    end
  end
  var=Test.new
  var.print_instvar              &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;&quot;kiwi&quot;, it works because a @instance_var can be accesed inside the class&lt;/font&gt;
  var.print_localvar             &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;undefined local variable or method 'localvar' for #&lt;Test:0x2b36208 @instvar=&quot;kiwi&quot;&gt; (NameError).&lt;/font&gt;
This will print the two lines &quot;kiwi&quot; and &quot;kiwi told you so!!&quot;, then fail with a undefined local variable or method 'localvar' for #&lt;Test:0x2b36208 @instvar=&quot;kiwi&quot;&gt; (NameError). Why? Well, in the scope of the method print_localvar there doesn't exists localvar, it exists in method initialize(until GC kicks it out). On the other hand, class variables '@@classvar' and '@instvar' are in scope across the entire class and, in the case of @@class variables, across the children classes.

  class SubTest &lt; Test
    def print_classvar
      puts @@classvar
    end
  end
  newvar=SubTest.new              &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#newvar is created and it has @@classvar with the same value as the var  instance of Test!!&lt;/font&gt;
  newvar.print_classvar           &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt;kiwi told you so!! &lt;/font&gt;
Class variables have the scope of parent class AND children, these variables can live across classes, and can be affected by the children actions ;-)

  class SubSubTest &lt; Test
    def print_classvar
      puts @@classvar
    end
    def modify_classvar
      @@classvar='kiwi kiwi waaai!!'
    end
  end
  subtest=SubSubTest.new          
  subtest.modify_classvar          &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#lets add a method that modifies the contents of @@classvar in  SubSubTest&lt;/font&gt;
  subtest.print_classvar
This new child of Test also has @@classvar with the original value newvar.print_classvar. The value of @@classvar has been changed to 'kiwi kiwi waaai!!' This shows that @@classvar is &quot;shared&quot; across parent and child classes.

== Default scope ==

When you don't enclose your code in any scope specifier, ex:

  @a = 33

it affects the default scope, which is an object called &quot;main&quot;.

For example, if you had one script that says

 @a = 33
 require 'other_script.rb'

and other_script.rb says

 puts @a
  &lt;font color=&quot;#007700&quot;&gt;#=&gt; 33&lt;/font&gt;

They could share variables.

Note however, that the two scripts don't share local variables.

== Local scope gotchas ==


Typically when you are within a class, you can do as you'd like for definitions, like.

&lt;pre&gt;
class A
  a = 3
  if a == 3

    def go 
       3
    end
  else
    def go
       4
    end  
  end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

And also, procs &quot;bind&quot; to their surrounding scope, like

&lt;pre&gt;
 a = 3
 b = proc { a }
 b.call # 3 -- it remembered what a was
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, the &quot;class&quot; and &quot;def&quot; keywords cause an *entirely new* scope.

&lt;pre&gt;
class A
  a = 3
  def go
     return a # this won't work!
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can get around this limitation by using define_method, which takes a block and thus keeps the outer scope (note that you can use any block you want, to, too, but here's an example).

&lt;pre&gt;
class A
   a = 3
  define_method(:go) { 
      a
  }
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's using an arbitrary block

&lt;pre&gt;
a = 3
PROC = proc { a } # gotta use something besides a local
# variable because that &quot;class&quot; makes us lose scope.

class A
  define_method(:go, &amp;PROC)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

or here
&lt;pre&gt;
 class A
 end
a = 3
 A.class_eval do
   define_method(:go) do
       puts a
   end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Logical And ==

The binary &quot;and&quot; operator will return the logical conjunction of its two operands. It is the same as &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; but with a lower precedence.
Example:
 a = 1
 b = 2
 c = nil
 puts &quot;yay all my arguments are true&quot; if a and b
 puts &quot;oh no, one of my argument is false&quot; if a and c

== Logical Or ==

The binary &quot;or&quot; operator will return the logical disjunction of its two operands. It is the same as &quot;||&quot; but with a lower precedence.
Example:
 a = nil
 b = &quot;foo&quot;
 c = a || b  # c is set to &quot;foo&quot; it's the same as saying c = (a || b)
 c = a or b  # c is set to nil   it's the same as saying (c = a) || b which is not what you want.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Prior to determining the suitability of a [[w:Learning management system|LMS]] for use in a particular environment we need to have an understanding of the technical issues that surround such a purchase.  Along with the technical issues we need to understand the terminology and physical equipment needed for an installation of an LMS.  This article attempts to provide the reader with an understanding of the technical issues, terminology and physical equipment that influence the selection of a learning management system.

==Basic Needs==
As training professionals we may have similar needs when it comes to selecting a Learning Management System.  Some of the basic needs may include the following:
:*A system that tracks student records
:*A system that allows for development of training courses
:*A system that allows for the use of third-party courseware
:*A system that track student needs/requirements for training
:*A system that tracks student requirements in relation to certifications/licenses
:*A system that includes standard and customizable reporting
:*A system that allows for a variety of forms of communication 
:*A System that allows for easy retrieval of stored information

==Basic Components of an LMS==
One of the first questions you may want to ask is what type of [http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid26_gci211708%2C00.html browser] does the LMS work with? A browser is a program that allows a user to view and interact with information on the Internet.  The three most common browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Since there are different versions of browsers you will also need to know what version the LMS works with. 

In a similar vein you need to know if the LMS will work with your current [http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0%2C%2Csid9_gci212714%2C00.html operating system]. An operating system is the program that manages all the other programs on your system.  Examples of operating systems are: Linux, Windows XP, VMS, OS/400, AIX, and z/OS. 

The following components should be familiar to you as they are utilized in most LMS systems.

;'''LDAP Directory''' : Most organizations use a [http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid40_gci214076%2C00.html LDAP] (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory to centralize user accounts.  LDAP is a software protocol (or set of rules) for enabling qualified individuals to locate individuals and other resources in a network on a corporate intranet. It stores information such as user information data, phone numbers, address and reporting structure.  It also manages authentication, meaning it makes sure that you have the right to access applications. It may be used by multiple applications such as email or online expense account forms.

;'''Relational DBMS''': Maintains three or more [http://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid87_gci211895,00.html databases] used by a LMS and may also contain other databases not used by the LMS.

;'''LMS Server''': This [http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid7_gci211796%2C00.html server] is the central point for access of information by users of the LMS.  A server is a computer or device on a network that manages network resources. For example, a file server stores files, a print server manages one or more printers, a network server manages network traffic and a database server processes database queries. 

;'''Delivery Server''': Used by some LMS's to display course structures so that students can navigate through activities.  The delivery server may also track student progress data and transmit it to the LMS server.

;'''Content Server''': This server stores content files for use with the LMS.

;'''SMTP Server''': The [http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0%2C%2Csid26_gci214219%2C00.html SMTP] (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server transfers all Help Desk requests and LMS-generated e-mail.

;'''FTP Server''': The [http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0%2C%2Csid9_gci213976%2C00.html FTP](File Transfer Protocol) server stores uploaded courses prior to importing into the LMS.

;'''Authoring Tool''': Authoring tools usually run on the client workstation and enable the course developers to create content and assessments.  

===Basic Configuration of a LMS===
[[Image:Lrngmgmtconfig.png]]

==Technical Issues==
When addressing vendors and working with your IT departments the following issues should be considered:
:*Does the LMS integrate with back-end systems?  The need to pass data to other applications such as Human Resources is an important feature.  You may not have the need currently, but check to see if it is possible as it may come up as a future need.
:*Does the LMS comply to your IT department standards?  What standards does the LMS comply to? Is it compliant with Section 508 Americans with Disabilities Act?  
:*Is the system able to connect to other applications?  Does it have documented API's? An API is an application protocol interface which allows the LMS to connect to other applications.  The API's should have documentation to describe how to perform the integration. 
:*Is the system interoperable?  Can it pass information back and forth between another application like the Human Resource department system?
:*How is the LMS built?  What are databases, operating systems and clients upon which it is built?  Will your IT department be able to support this configuration?
:*Does the LMS support an LDAP directory?

Without a basic understanding of the technical issues, software and hardware associated with an LMS it would be difficult to understand what vendors are offering.  Hopefully this short article has given the reader some information to begin to understand what goes into purchasing and implementing a LMS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hive bodies are the exterior structure of the hive.

In a [[Beekeeping/Langstroth_Hive|Langstroth bee hive]], the hive body is a four-sided box, with the top and bottom open for stacking.  Two sides are notched to support the top bars of removable [[Beekeeping/Frames|frames]].  A complete hive consists of a [[Beekeeping/Bottom_Board|bottom board]], one or more hive bodies, an [[Beekeeping/Inner_Cover|inner cover]] and a top/weather cover.

Commercial hive bodies are sized around a 20 inch basic dimension.  They are 20&quot; from front to back, and hold 8 or 10 frames (14&quot; or 17&quot;) across the width.  &quot;Deep&quot; hive bodies are approximately 10&quot; tall and &quot;medium&quot; are 6-5/8&quot; tall (approximately 1/2 and 1/3 of 20&quot; respectively).  A typical commercial hive consists of a two deep bodies called brood bodies on the bottom, a [[Beekeeping/Queen_Excluder|queen excluder]] screen, and three medium bodies called 'supers' on top.  There is no difference between the brood bodies and supers, only how they are used by the colony and the beekeeper.  Colonies naturally produce brood lower in the hive, and store excess above.  Honey is harvested only from the supers, and they are shorter solely for ease of lifting. 

Bees will sometimes identify the wrong hive as their home hive, and an attempt to enter the wrong hive can be a fatal mistake. Although many hive bodies are often painted a single color, some beekeepers claim to have found that a variety of bright colors can help the bees find their way back to their hives more easily. The arrangement of the hive stacks may also be important for visual recognition of the home hive. However, since bees likely use many other visual, spatial and olfactory cues to identify their home hive, the color of the hive bodies may have only a marginal effect on choice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Digital Storytelling? ==

The Digital Storytelling Association,[[http://www.dsaweb.org]] defines Digital Storytelling as &quot;the modern expression of the ancient art of storytelling. Throughout history, storytelling has been used to share knowledge, wisdom, and values. Stories have taken many different forms. Stories have been adapted to each successive medium that has emerged, from the circle of the campfire to the silver screen, and now the computer screen.&quot; &lt;br&gt;

&quot;Digital stories derive their power by weaving images, music, narrative and voice together, thereby giving deep dimension and vivid color to characters, situations, experiences, and insights. Tell your story now digitally.&quot;
- Leslie Rule, Digital Storytelling Association. &lt;br&gt;

Telling a story &quot;digitally&quot; means merging a short narrative, with corresponding audio, and various types of visual media, including photos, artwork, letters, and digital video. It also brings storytelling to the computer arena – so that it may be more easily distributed, communicated and linked with other stories, in order to create a global storytelling experience.&lt;br&gt;

On his website, Daniel Meadows outlines the parameters for what constitutes a digital story. The script must be 250 words, using 10-12 still photos and about 2 minutes long. &lt;br&gt;

Strict parameters such as these enforce a sort of diligence where artistic creation is concerned (think sonnets or haiku.) &lt;br&gt;

Here is a link to Daniel Meadows digital story webpage. There is a tutorial on this page also.  [[http://www.photobus.co.uk/index.php?id=2&amp;gallery=polyfoto.flv]]

According to Joe Lambert in his [[http://www.storycenter.org/cookbook.pdf]]&quot;Digital Storytelling Cookbook and Travelling Companion&quot; document, a good digital story must contain seven elements.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point of View – Who is the narrator and why is he/she talking to us?
&lt;li&gt;Dramatic Question – Desire – Action - Realization
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Content – What are the emotions associated with your narrative?
&lt;li&gt;The Gift of your Voice – What does your narrator sound like?
&lt;li&gt;The Power of the Soundtrack – What music sets the mood for your story?
&lt;li&gt;Economy – Keep it short and succinct.
&lt;li&gt;Pacing – The rhythm of the story helps set the tone
&lt;/ol&gt;

== History ==

Digital Storytelling came about in the early 1990's when a group of [[http://www.storycenter.org/history.html]] &quot;media artists, designers and practitioners&quot; got together to merge elements of storytelling with new digital media.

== Digital Storytelling in Education ==

According to Carole McCulloch, of Tafe Frontiers in Melbourne, Australia, Digital Storytelling can be used in educational settings to:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a competency
&lt;li&gt;Describe a process
&lt;li&gt;In Portfolios of achievement
&lt;li&gt;Develop writing skills and sense of story for younger students
&lt;/ul&gt;

In addition to the above, Digital Storytelling can be used to motivate students.  Most students love working on computers. Computers provide students access to tools they can use to enhance the expression of their thoughts and ideas in ways they might not be able to do otherwise.  Pictures, graphics, drawing tools, color and sound feed students' creativity.  Using storytelling parameters, students would also have to address the presentation of their content from aspects. They would have to use their planning and organizational skills as well as their creative ones. Through storyboarding students can develop planning and writing skills by outlining what will take place. Students also learn how to summarize an event or process for a specific audience.  The Digital Story could be viewed as a rubric to assist students in creating their projects. Although it may sound a little intimidating to some, most students would probably find it a refreshing departure from traditional educational assignments and thus more likely to stay engaged.     

Join the &quot;Digital Storytelling Network&quot; [[http://www.groups.edna.edu.au/course/view.php?id=107]] to communicate directly with Carole McCulloch, among others working with Digital Storytelling.

Faculty and graduate students at the University of Houston have created a website called the Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling [http://digitalstorytelling.coe.uh.edu/] which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.

== Things to Think about Before Implementing Into a Classroom:  A Teacher's Reflection  ==  

Although students are familiar with films and may have exposure with creating multimedia presentations, the concept of Digital Story Telling is abstract for many students.  In a recent attempt to incorporate Digital Story Telling into the elementary classroom, It became apparent that students need to be provided with examples of quality projects.  Some things that you will want to emphasize your students are:
*Planning is pertinent to creating a quality project
*Create clear illustrations
*Use a loud, clear voice when recording the narration
*Be patient
*If necessary, do things over.  

Beyond preparing students to be successful, it is pertinent that the teacher create an environment that is conducive to effective story telling.  For example, if the project is being completed in a small space, not all groups will be able to record their narrations at the same time.  Too much background noise will muddle recordings.  If you choose to have groups scan pictures for use in their presentation, you may need to stagger the groups to ensure that students are actively involved in the project whenever time is allotted to work on it.  

It is also necessary to make sure that the equipment that will be used in the creation of these projects is available.  Students will need access to computers, microphones, digital camcorders, digital cameras, scanners, and software that allows for the creation of multimedia presentations.  If your school is networked and students are not provided with file strorage large enough to hold these large electronic files, the teacher will need to develop a plan for how these projects are going to be stored while the students are working on them.

== Good Digital Stories: ==

'''Are personal:'''
''The creator of the digital presentation is in the story in a key way — as the narrator and sometimes also as the protagonist. While many digital storytelling projects feature third parties, the narrator is encouraged to personalize the tale, making it clear how the people or events in the story impacted his or her life.''

'''Begin with the story/script:'''
''In workshops by CDS, DigiTales, and others, participants are expected to narrow in on their story, writing and even recording their script before they ever begin digitizing images, importing sound effects, or using video editing tools. Jason Ohler, in an introduction to his soon-to-be-released book, Telling Your Story, points out that having students &quot;create and tell stories before they [get] to use all the empowering and distracting technology at their disposal&quot; is an important way to avoid &quot;enabling the technophile at the expense of the story teller in...students.&quot;''

'''Are concise:'''
''Typically, a digital story will run from two to five minutes in length. This means tight editing and a very specific focus. In Scott County, Kentucky, Leslie Flanders and Jeanne Biddle explain to students that the goal is to narrow the story down to a single &quot;nugget&quot; — one central idea or message.''

'''Use readily-available source materials:'''
''Although camcorders might be used in the creation of a digital story, they are not essential. In fact, some consider them a distraction from the end product. Instead, many digital stories rely heavily on photographs, hand-drawn illustrations, and other scanned-in images, along with transition effects, to accompany the recorded narrative. The staff at CDS refer to the medium they teach as being like &quot;PowerPoint on steroids.&quot; They have embraced this approach because it &quot;puts the participant in the editing chair, with a minimal amount of preparation.&quot;''

'''Include universal story elements:'''
''Although proponents of digital storytelling describe and label these terms in a number of different ways, good stories — digital or not — include essential elements such as conflict, transformation, and closure. Furthermore, they are told in a way that allows the audience to, as Ohler puts it, &quot;identify with them, remember them, and be changed by them.&quot;''

'''Involve collaboration:'''
''&quot;Story circles,&quot; in which participants give and receive feedback on their stories and scripts, are an important part of many digital storytelling workshops. As Joe Lambert puts it, &quot;Storytelling is meant to be a collaborative art. It is much more realistic this way, and much more fun.&quot;''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The MS WindowsMobile(SmartPhone) OS came out without a J2ME JVM at least from Microsoft.  However, because of consumer and Mobile Operator demand the OEMs of the MS WindowsMobile platform started partnering with JVM vendors to provide this functionality.

==HTC==
In 2001 High Technology Computer gained a contract from Microsoft to design MS Smartphones based on MS's Stinger concept design.  As both consumers and mobile operators demanded java functionality in form of J2ME/MIDP; HTC partnered with several JVM OEMs to bring this functionality to HTC MS powered smartphones. HTC smartphones can be found with many OEMs and Mobile Operators as evidenced by this table at XDA-developers.com({{Web reference|work=HTC Phone Models|title=HTC Phone Models|URL=http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php?pagename=HTC_PhoneModels}}).

==Conclusion==
By gathering what JVMs are being used in these devices either by HTC information or the JVM OMEs themselves one can determine the optional J2ME APIs that can be accessed.   The minimum configuration seems to be MIDP 2.0/CLDC 1.0 and JTWI 1.0.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are familiar with some basic microeconomics, particularly the demand and supply curves, this section shouldn't be too demanding. &lt;b&gt;Aggregate Demand&lt;/b&gt; or Aggregate Expenditure (abbreviated to '''AD''' and '''AE''' respectively) is essentially the demand curve for goods and services for a ''whole'' economy. There are determinable ''parts'', known as '''components of aggregate demand''', which the next few pages will explain in more detail.

== Components of Aggregate Demand ==
The formula for finding AD is as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;AD = C + I + G + X - M&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

=== Consumption (C) ===
This is the expenditure by consumer on goods and services, including both durable and non-durable goods but not including ''saving''. While values vary widely between economies, 'C' usually accounts for 40-60% of GDP. Because of this, high or low consumer confidence, and consequently high or low consumer spending can change the course in an economy.

=== Investment (I) ===
Strictly known as '''Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation''', this is the money spent by firms ('''not''' the government or consumers) on capital investment ie. new machinery and factories. There is some argument as to whether ''human capital'' (training) should be included. Investment also includes stocks and goods and services not yet completed; for example, car firms will likely have many machines part-built or stored at any one time. Since they cannot be included in consumption since they have not been purchased, stores must be included in I.

Investment makes up approximately 10% of GDP in most economies, and governments are often keen to increase this value, as investment helps to increase the possible output of economy (strictly LRAS or the PPF).

=== Government Spending (G) ===
Strictly known as '''General Government Final Consumption''', it is the expenditure by the government, not including transfer payments (eg. social security, welfare benefits since they are simply moving money around the economy). Governments usually spend on public and merit goods. These are microeconomic terms - a public good is one that is provided to everybody and cannot be exclusive by its nature (think street lighting), whilst a merit good is one that is under-supplied and under-demanded as consumers do not appreciate all the benefits, because some of those benefits do not directly apply to the buyer (think environmentally friendly vehicles).

Changes in government spending as a method of controlling the economy is known as fiscal policy - more of that later on.

=== Exports and Imports (X-M) ===
Exports are a positive figure on Aggregate Demand as overseas customers purchase goods and services produced here. Imports, on the other hand, are not produced here, though they are consumed here. Think of imports as money leaving the economy.

== Aggregate Demand Curve ==
''diagrams!''
=== Shifting the AD Curve ===
Shifting of the AD curve occurs when there is any change in any of the four components of Total Expenditure, i.e., C, I, G or (X-M). If there is an increase in Total Expenditure then the Aggregate Demand Curve shifts rightwards. Again, when there is a decline in total expenditure, the aggregate demand curve shifts leftwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Beekeeping entrance reducer.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden Entance Reducer]]

==Usage==
Entrance reducers have several purposes including controlling traffic, temperature and ventilation within a hive. Most commonly, entrance reducers are only used for new or low population colonies, weak colonies, or during times of low temperature.
Store bought entrance reducers are nothing more than wooden cleats with two varying sized notches, one on each plane. Entrance reducers are designed so that when sandwiched between the [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| bottom board]] and the lower [[Beekeeping/Hive Body| hive body]], a narrow entrance and exit port is created. By rotating the entrance reducer 90&amp;deg; vertically a different sized notch, and there by a different sized exit is used. Finally a hive can be completely opened by removing the entrance reducer altogether. Traditionally the size of the notch used is dependant on the traffic belonging to the hive. As more bees that are coming and going, the size of the entrance should be increased.

==Selecting an Entrance Reducer==
There does not exist mass variation between entrance reducers that are available for purchase. However, some keepers forgo the added (minimal) cost and simply use grass or rags to close a hive's entrance.

==Purchasing==
Most often, entrance reducers come packed with bottom boards and it is thereby often unnecessary to purchase one separately. Despite this common practice, be sure that an entrance reducer is part of the package deal before you end up with out one.

==Maintenance==
*Entrance reducers may need to be occasionally scraped of [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] but should otherwise not need any real maintenance.
*When not using an entrance reducer in a hive, store it well as to prevent warping or damage.

==Tips==
*Grass, leaves or clean rags can be used if necessary in place of an entrance reducer.
*Some beekeepers choose to varnish or preserve their entrance reducers much like their hive bodies.

'''Plantains''' are hard, starchy [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]]s used for cooking, as contrasted with the soft, sweet [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] varieties. Plantains are a staple food in the tropical regions of the world, treated in much the same way as [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es and with a similar neutral flavour and texture when unripe. It is unknown whether plantains were grown in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans.

Ripe plantains can be eaten raw, or they can be used for cooking at any stage of ripeness. Green plantains are firm and starchy and resemble potatoes in flavour. Yellow plantains are still firm and starchy but slightly sweeter. Extremely ripe plantains are black, with a soft deep yellow pulp that is much sweeter than the earlier stages of ripeness. These black plantains can be used in sweet dishes, but they still must be cooked.

Plantains are also dried and ground into flour; banana meal forms an important foodstuff, with the following constituents: water 10.62, albuminoids 3.55, fat 1.15, carbohydrates 81.67 (more than 2/3 starch), fibre 1.15, phosphates 0.26, other salts, 1.60. The sugar is chiefly sucrose. 

Plantain fruit can be brewed into an alcoholic drink. The rootstock which bears the leaves is soft and full of starch just before the flowering period, and it is sometimes used as food in Ethiopia; the young shoots of several species are cooked and eaten.

There are several races of the honeybee. Each of these races has different advantages and disadvantages linked to their original regional background. Each region likely has a differing climate, topography, resources and predators. Because of difference in background, each race of honey bees have evolved slightly in a different manner than their cousins allowing them to better take advantage of their specific situation.
Today the [[#Italian Honey Bee| Italian Honey Bee]] is the most commonly kept honey bee in the United States, conversely the [[#Africanized Honey Bee| Africanized Honey Bee]] is the most feared and illegal to keep in many regions. Fitting somewhere between these two extremes include many of the other races and the [[#Feral Honey Bee| Feral Honey Bee]], though technically not a race in its own, it may be acclimated to the area in which it has been found.
The following is a partial listing of the races of honeybee that may be available to a prospective beekeeper, along side is a brief amount of information regarding each race and some common advantages and disadvantages with each.

==Africanized Honey Bee==
&lt;small&gt;''Apis mellifera scutellata''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The [[w:Africanized bee| Africanized honey bee]], also known as the killer bee. Because of the media attention received, Africanized bees have been given a bad name. This is not to say that they can’t be more dangerous than standard honeybees, their representation has simply been blown out of proportion. There have been several more recent breeding programs that have produced a more gentle form of this race. This gentler form of bee has even become one of the more sought after honeybee races in regions of Brazil.

The [[w:Buckfast Bee| Buckfast hybrid]] was produced by [[w:Karl Kehrle| Brother Adam]] of the [[w:Buckfast Abbey| Buckfast Abbey]]. Brother Adam crossed a great many races of bees with the British bee in hopes of creating a superior breed. The results are what is now known as the Buckfast Bee.

== Replacing rear wheel ==

Hello

I need to know how to replace the rear wheel. WHile it sounds easy enough (disassembly was brainless -- it almost disassembles itself), the reinstallation (this is after replacing a tube) had problems. There is obviously a right way and a wrong way to install a rear wheel back on to the moped, and I did it the wrong way. I am getting a &quot;ker-chunking&quot; on acceleration that wasn't there before. What should I be looking for, for a proper installation?

BTW, this is an incredible reference. It definitely shows promise.</text>

__NOTOC__
A pleasantly-surprising recipe encountered in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]]. Also, a good first attempt for beginning deep-fryers. Makes a good substitute to chips or [[Cookbook:French Fries|fries]].

==Ingredients==

* canned or frozen [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]]  (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==

# If using frozen corn, thaw. If using canned corn, microwave in a glass bowl or gently heat on the stove until warm.
# Coat corn with a light layer of [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]].
# Mix salt and pepper into the flour, [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]] or other [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]] optional.
# Move corn from the egg wash and cover with flour.
# Heat oil to moderate to high heat.
# Deep-fry floured corn until golden brown on the outside (less than two minutes).
# Serve as a complement to another dish

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy. An oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] is less likely to cause problems, including indoor air pollution and fire. See [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|Deep-frying]] for more warnings.

==Variation==
Substitute moderately-chopped [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] and [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] for additional flavors.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Design ==
Creating a video game is no simple task, it is the step that requires the most creative effort and artistic vision. This chapter will help you get through it.

=== Thesis ===
;A '''Game''' is defined as: &quot;a recreational activity involving one or more players, defined by 1) a goal that the players try to reach, and 2) some set of rules that determines what the players can do. Games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment, but may also serve an educational or simulational role.&quot;

=== Planning comes first ===
The most important task in any game developing process is having a plan, whether that plan involves using a really well thought-out concept, a basic idea, or going into a full-blown production. Another aspect is that the plan must be possible to implement in software and on available hardware. Gaming platforms and game designs place high and specific requirements on software which differ from the requirements of other software platforms.

==== Be creative... ====
In the gaming industry there is a constant need for [[w:Innovation|innovation]] games with better graphics, better music, better controls, games with new realm, new laws, new types of games. 

But this does not mean every game has to be all new. Innovation can be as simple as new perspective, a new spin on an old idea.

===== Brainstorming =====
[[w:Brainstorming|Brainstorm]]. Think of all the ideas that you can and write them down. (do not worry about good ones yet, keep them all). Then after you have thought of all that you can, eliminate the ones you do not like as much, are impossible, etc. And form a [[w:Concept|concept]] for the video game. For example the concept of Tetris would be: ''Differently shaped blocks fall and you try and line them up on the ground to make lines to get points''.

==== Steps ====
Before we can create a video game that generations can enjoy (or a simple game to amuse friends, yourself, or potential mates), we need to discuss the '''Five ''W'''s of Development.'''

* Why
What is the purpose of developing this game?
* Who
Who will be the actor? Who is our target audience? Who do we care to entertain, frustrate, puzzle?
* What
What is the point of the game? What Type of game is it? What is the objective ?
* When
How long will it take to complete the plot ? 
* Where
Where can the game be played?

'''Practical application'''
Sometimes one can learn as much from a bad example as a good example.

===== WHY: Purpose for the video game =====
While designing your game consider your purpose for creating the game. Is it because you enjoy making games, or because you want to make a lot of money? Think about the audience who you are going to be selling this to, is that their purpose for playing the game? To spend lots of money or because they enjoy playing games? You should have at least some idea of the replies to these question before you can proceed constructively toward your goal.

===== WHO: Market considerations =====
Since you will be designing a game for other to play, having a consideration on the design to what market you are producing is extremely important. Who are you marketing it to? Teenagers? Little girls? What must you do to market it to that group? What are that group interests ? Where do you have less competition? What are your target audience interested in?

===== WHO: Understand the player =====
Almost every game requires a type of strategy toward gaining control of the motivator (the reason for committing to play). The logical reasoning, and generated optimal strategies normally used in game play are mathematically described and psychologically studied by the science of [[w:Game theory|Game Theory]]. The Wikibook [[Introduction to Game Theory]] tries to cover the subject in greater depth, but anyone creating any type of game that involves complex decision processes should have at least a passing knowledge on this subject.

Players can be classified in four major classes that are not mutually exclusive but one will have predominance over the other, the player will be:
*Competitor
*Achiever
*Explorer
*Socializer

====== Gender orientation ====== 
It is scientifically proven that video games tend to activate the reward regions of brains. While differently in males and females, since gender is also characterized by specific preferences and mental predisposition, this fact explains why males are more attracted to, and more likely to become &quot;hooked&quot; on video games than females, especially since video games are themselves generally oriented towards male players.  

Males are visual oriented and more attracted to technology, mechanical complexity (note that while video games are coded using algorithms and represented in virtualized form, a majority of games can be defined replicating mechanical constructs). Most of the computer games that are really popular with males are the ones that simulate tasks and goals that are similar to the real world preferences (challenges of performance, conquest, enabling obtaining ranks or establish a stratified collaboration team or promote status even if only in the virtual word). 

Females on the other hand are more emotional oriented, tend to be more inclined to games that promote or simulate social interaction among equals and will be more opened to tackle games that will have more complex plot lines and a higher level of complexity of interactions running at the same time.

Creating a game that caters to both genders would probably be an impossible task, in this case other fields of culture also can serve as a guideline. For instance, consider how genders deal differently with movies and books. In games things are not that different - only richer and with a greater level of freedom of implementation. As an example, a book author will not have to deal with color schemes (not considering the cover). Art is only an imitation of life.

===== WHAT: Goals and objectives =====
As any other task a game has to have a goal or a objective and those must be clear (or seem so) to the player.

===== WHERE: Technical requirements =====
Before you start to conceptualize the game you must establish the initial technical requirements available. See what technologies can be used, determine the target platform and the time for the implementation.

Some of the requirements may create a bottleneck for the implementation, others my require that you create or change normal tools or other parts of what would normally be the framework for the implementation. This can often not be known before you start your game design, and not all games designs are created for immediate implementation, they can often be stored for future use when a technology is available or the license prices, production team or implementation is right.

So, technical requirement are most often mutable and unpredictable, but a required consideration for the design stage.

==== A note about gamification ====
Gamification is simply described as the merge of non-leisure activities with games. 

{{TODO|Mine [[wikipedia:Gamification]], show points about (enterprise vs player) goals and the initial attempt to trick people and the benefit of transparency, NASA and Folding at home examples.}}

==== Games as a learning medium ====
Games can be easily turned into learning platforms, finding the right approach to turn a game experience into a learning one (or an aid to consolidate knowledge) it the trick that permits games that teach. Game and learning are inseparable from the start, the act of playing a game is the act of becoming proficient in the games rules and to attempt to excel in its uses in a competitive way. As all the things that humans like patterns are at the top, we are attracted by logic sets and combinations in any form. Patternization and the automation of those patterns is what our brains do best. Games are very prone to help us not only to build what we define as muscular memory (automated responses) but go beyond to deep learning of abstract concepts without the need of extensive formalisms required for class room format.

=== Design Phase ===
[[Image:Leonardo_Design_for_a_Flying_Machine,_c._1505.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Cover: A Da Vinci sketch of a flying machine. ]]

When you have your concept, expand it. Using the Tetris example again, think about the shapes of the blocks, how many points things are worth. Consider the '''Theory''' discussed earlier in the book, what is the character-player relationship? What is the character's role? What is the challenge, what is the risk? What is the reward? What could be lost? What is the realm?

When designing the levels consider what was discussed on ''difficulty'' and challenge. If it is too hard before the player has been able to gain logic and skill in the realm, the player will not want to play. And if the game is too easy, same thing. Consider how challenging elements of a level are, do the rewards of the levels outweigh the loss or is it too easy to die?

==== Moral and ethical considerations ====
Moral and ethics can be important elements in defining the game concept as they help to exclude unacceptable ideas not only to the creator but to the player or the community that will be impacted by the game distribution. Today we have probably a heightened sense of protection for the society in general and children in particular, sometimes beyond what is reasonably acceptable, so determining limits to what should and should not be covered will definitely help in planning.

===== Addiction =====
The psychology study of behavioral addiction, has not generated yet enough scientific research to claim that video games are addictive in nature, that is generate an [[w:Addiction|addiction]].

Note however that gambling addiction (ludomania), pathological gambling, is considered to be an impulse control disorder similar to many other impulse control disorders such as kleptomania, pyromania and is therefore not considered by the [[w:American Psychological Association|American Psychological Association]] to be an addiction. 

While there is a possibility that video games can be addictive, they are structural different from other forms of what is normally classified as addictive activities. For instance when dealing with substance abuse the addiction is created by the body's dependence on the drug, if we translate this into the area of video games we can only define two types of substances that can create a modest addiction, endorphins and adrenaline, and video games are not the best or the only way to obtain a &quot;fix&quot; of those substances, even if a person begins to crave for the biological sensation these natural substances generate, a video game will tend not to provide them with enough consistency and strength to really create an addiction, making the player unable to cope without the substance, it can however reinforce and generate a [[w:Compulsive behavior|compulsive behavior]].

{{NOTE|For instance smokings creates both an addiction to [[w:Nicotine|nicotine]] and compulsive behavior.}}

===== Compulsion =====
Video game compulsion is very similar to, [[w:Problem gambling|problem gambling]] even if not so rapid and destructive, if we look at the media or art that are similar and even utilized in video games, like images, music or plot, most games would have the same risk of creating an addiction that a good movie, a book or your favorite painting. 

So the issue must be centered in the game mechanics, presentation and the environment surrounding the activity. The emotional and social framework around playing any type of game in general, peer acceptance, reputation, etc. become factors that act as promoters for the activity and reinforce the compulsion.

In the case of compulsion, the psychological need to do an action, there the video game can have relevance, depending on the social structure of the player. If there was improper emotional development, substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, or personality disorders then most of these problems could also contribute to an isolation and detachment from normal society. This is also common with Internet addiction, that in fact is a psychological craving to be in the communal action, be informed and participative.

Video games that are played over the Internet would better come under the same issues, but it is not a general problem of games, but a result of the psychological fragility of the person/player and the general state of society. One can not specifically blame games, and not all persons will be at the same level of susceptibility.

====== Compulsive presentations and games mechanics ======
Several video game creators, including [[w:Shigeru Miyamoto|Shigeru Miyamoto]], have stepped up and denounced the practice of creating games around compulsive rewarding mechanics, labeled as &quot;carrot and the stick&quot; called such mechanics unethical.

Compulsion can be avoided by limiting repetitive patterns in games, but of course some game creators seek actively to reinforce the compulsive behavior. Sadly this is becoming a fad especially in many Internet activities, including games that depend in continued play for revenue or even social networks that simply require continued participation.

==== Examine the competition ====
Part of the process should include a look on the availing offering similar to what you are intending to create, have references and solidify your expectations.

==== Contextualize ====
For a game to be attractive and engaging its actions need to take place in an as rich as possible environment. One must chose between two poles, realism and the absurd, the mixing of the two must be done with artful understanding of the comic and ironic.

Context is the background universe of the game, it is all the extras that are not themselves a requirement for the gameplay. Some universes where the plot takes place are not possible to seem realistic at all, therefore one must not try to go beyond what is necessary to keep the player interested and its actions significant in that specific context.

A dynamic universe will often increase the game replay value on its own, since at each attempt the player will have the chance of discovering and observe something new, even if it does not have a direct impact on the gameplay it will be in itself rewarding.

The created context for the gameplay must fit the game's objectives and not the other way around, if the game is simple it will not require a complex background but as gameplay complexity increases the right context must be provided as to sustain the player motivation for continued engagement.

Context has the main purpose of activating and then conforming to the player's imagination, in this cultural background is an important consideration. This task can be archived by the use of images, sound and a good story.

==== Narrative ====
If the ''objective'' is the point of the game, what you are trying to accomplish, the narrative is what drives the player to attempt to archive it, it provides not only the reason for the player actions but creates all the environment were they are to be performed serves to move the player along the game.

Some game types are elusively dependent on the interactive narration. That is the game evolution or experience is a partnership between the game designer and the player.

'''Story telling (the plot)'''&lt;br&gt;
All games do not necessarily have the &quot;once upon a time...&quot; plot, however, in every game there is a narrative of sorts. For one thing ''every'' game has an objective. This objective can be simple as making a line to get points in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris Tetris] or as complicated as saving the princess in Zelda.

In Tetris you move from level to level in chronological order according to the finishing of prior levels. In games with a story line, the plot is the storyline. The narrative is important to the player as it gives them a sense of ''progression''.

The first step to any successful game is to have a great, or as close as you can came up to it, is the narrative, since the goal can be less than the road that needs to be traveled. This is why 3D games sell so well, even if most of them does not deliver anything really innovative. If you produce a great visual show with distracting shiny visuals people forget to look for a plot or can even be made to like absurd things that any marketing researcher would bet his life on that you should not include on your masterwork. Before you make any game, you should first ask yourself &quot;Is this game fun? Would I want to play my game?&quot; What would the point of making a game if you do not think your own game is fun? Think what type of game YOU would want to play. It is also a good idea to start small. If your first project is to make the next Halo, or 3d MMO you will probably fail miserably. Start with something simple like PONG, and work your way up from there.

More complex games my require a richer environment to captivate the gamer, writing game stories today may be even more complex than writing the next blockbuster scrip. There are even conferences for innovative storytelling in computer games. (See for instance [http://stagconf.com/ StagConf]).

Building a workable plot, is very similar to writing a movie script, you will need hooks and a good story telling capability, to get the player involved into the action.

{{TODO|There are some Wikibooks covering writing and movies, this could probably be referenced and even have content mined for this section.}}

'''Sequel Sickness'''&lt;br&gt;
Sequel Sickness is contagious, Hollywood has it, and so does the gaming industry. Often times, developers will see that a game has done outstanding and decide to make a sequel. Now, sequels are not inherently bad, however they usually turn out to be.

When developing a sequel, remember that it has a lot to live up to. ''A sequel must be as good as or better than the previous game'' and you should only make the sequel if ''it has something to add to the original''. 

A sequel that does not live up to its predecessor can ruin both (or all) the games in a series. So be careful.

'''The Mime Syndrome'''&lt;br&gt;
Another illness comes from Hollywood too. The Mime Syndrome is where game developers try to make a game based off a movie or a book. Usually the game precisely mimics the movie or book so the plot has already been experienced by the player - what is the point?

Movie games usually tear a movie/book apart using the generic ''movie game template'' where they take the movie/book putting in apathetic collectibles, and plot points. If you ever make a game based off a movie or book consider what it really is, what it means to its fans - how are avid players going to feel about the game based off of it? And do not just copy the movie/book if the players wanted that - they would just go read the book or watch the movie. Come up with your own plot points within the style of the media you are creating the book from and do not just roll out another cheap movie game. Remember, most movie/book games result in failure in the market, only few actually succeed.

If you cannot be cured of Mime Syndrome, do not make a movie/book game.

===== Level design =====

==== Playability ==== 
An important aspect of any game is good gameplay. You could have the best looking and sounding game on the planet but if the gameplay is bad, it will be a bad game and no one will want to play it. A good game always has a creative hook. It has to be a game that players will want to play. It may have a creative story, with many plot twists. But what makes some computer games so addictive? Why do so many of us spend countless hours sitting, our eyes stuck on a computer screen? 

There are so many answers to these questions that several (very heavy) books could be written on the subject. People like to have fun, but have different tastes and thus different definitions of &quot;fun&quot;. To Carl, mowing the lawn may be &quot;fun&quot;, while Ryan may find it a complete bore. You see, fun is not simply &quot;goofing off&quot;. You can have fun doing something constructive. Anything you find enjoyable can be described as &quot;fun&quot;.

==== Progression &amp; Achievement ==== 
The feeling of achievement of progress should hinge in mastering the game mechanics.

====== Fairness ======
The sense of fairness is extremely important, especially when competing with other human players, noting that an AI is cheating, if too obvious can also be extremely vexing even if to a small degree excusable and even expected (depending on the game type).

{{TODO|Examples, link to artificial intelligence and balancing of game mechanics, to the challenge factor and issues in marketing good games with lousy opponents.}}

====== Replay value ======
{{TODO|Create a clear distinction between replay (start over) and continued interests, they are not the same and distinct in relation to game types.}}

Replay Value is the value of starting over and playing the game again (or continuing playing) after you have already finished playing the game. If the game is only playable once, then it really is not worth much, is it? The sign of a truly superb game is one you can play over and over again, whether you continue on beyond the plot through mini-games and side-quests or you simply start it completely over.

Some aspects that give a game replay value (besides just being really well done) are mini-games, side-quests, challenges that go beyond the scope of the plot (find all the... to get...), unlockables, and so forth.

'''Mini-games'''
A mini-game is a 'game within a game'. Usually these are arcade-like games such as racing, puzzles, and so forth. The Zelda series incorporates mini-games in Ocarina of Time with archery, fishing, and so forth. The challenge to get the highest score possible in a mini-game is a good motivator for replay.

'''Unlockables'''
An unlockable is some type of reward that the player can unlock by doing something (such as getting all the... or finding the...). These can be very helpful in increasing replay value.

==== Innovation ====
Breaking new grounds in the creation of video games be it technology, or concept can be a high point for your production, it can make your game pop out among similar offerings and even create specific niche where no other product will be competing with your creation. 

Innovation in game concept is often interlinked with the creation of new technology, this is not at all a requirement but is often necessary to create get deeper into the framework to provide the features required for the implementation. This can also create a new revenue stream, for instance if you create a specific engine or technology that can be relicensed to other creators.

The danger of going out of the box is that it can also break playability or reduce the target market in a way that will restrict adoption by the public, this is a thin line that must be carefully considered.

==== Composition ====
This is one of the final steps of the game design process, it is the critical analysis on how well each game component fits into the design and how best to tweak its use.

'''Style consistency'''&lt;br&gt;
Remember to keep all the graphics, sound, and gameplay in the same style. Something painted by Picasso would NOT look the same as something painted by Davinci. Make sure that everything is stylized similarly - do not mix Picasso and Davinci.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{HornNavTechnique}}
== Transposition ==
Many older pieces for horn were written for a horn not keyed in F as is standard today. As a result, a requirement for modern horn players is to be able to read music in other keys. This is most commonly done by transposing the music &quot;on the fly&quot; into F. A reliable way to transpose is to liken the written notes (which rarely deviate from written C, D, E, and G) to their counterparts in the scale the F horn will be playing in.
Commonly seen transpositions include:
* '''B&amp;#x266d; alto''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:perfect fourth|perfect fourth]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''A alto''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:major third|major third]]
* '''G''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:major second|major second]]
* '''E''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor second|minor second]]
* '''E&amp;#x266d;''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:major second|major second]] &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''D''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor third|minor third]]
* '''C''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:perfect fourth|perfect fourth]]
* '''B&amp;#x266d; basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:perfect fifth|perfect fifth]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Some less common transpositions include:
* '''A&amp;#x266d; alto''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:minor third|minor third]]
* '''G&amp;#x266d;''' &amp;ndash; up a [[Wikipedia:minor second|minor second]]
* '''D&amp;#x266d;''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:major third|major third]] (used in some works by [[Wikipedia:Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Wikipedia:Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Wikipedia:Richard Strauss|Strauss]] (Der Rosenkavalier))
* '''B''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:tritone|tritone]] (used by Brahms) &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* '''A basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor sixth|minor sixth]] (used in some works by Verdi)
* '''A&amp;#x266d; basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:major sixth|major sixth]] (used in some works by Verdi)
* '''G basso''' &amp;ndash; down a [[Wikipedia:minor seventh|minor seventh]] (used in some works by Verdi)

It has been speculated that one of the reasons Brahms wrote for horn in the awkward key of B was to encourage the horns to use the natural horn; he did not like the sound of the new valved horns. An example of this is when Brahms picked the second horn player, Wilhelm Kleinecke, in the Vienna Opera for a performance of the Horn Trio in E flat, op. 40 over the first horn, Richard Lewy, because Lewy only played the valved horn. [http://www.osmun.com/reference/brahms/Title_Page.html]

Sometimes it is ambiguous whether a piece should be transposed up or down (i.e. B&amp;#x266d; alto versus B&amp;#x266d; basso when only B&amp;#x266d; is written). It is usually safe to assume that the most common and reasonable transposition is the intended transposition (i.e. it stays in the normal horn range). More can be decided from the history of the composer. For example, Verdi and other opera composers used many low and odd transpositions. For Haydn symphonies that have trumpets, the lower transposition for the horns is usually correct; otherwise the high transposition is usually correct. After gaining much experience, this decision-making should come easily to the horn player.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''In older scores (many times German), B&amp;#x266d; alto and basso are written simply as &quot;B.&quot;''

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''E&amp;#x266d; horns were used extensively in military bands in the early 20th century, therefore band parts written for chromatic E&amp;#x266d; horns are common.''

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ''Brahms indicated the key of B as &quot;H.&quot;''

== Learning to Transpose ==

Many ideas are out there as to how to think of transposing. Here a few are presented. Pick the ones that work for you and use them. In the end, knowing what note to play is what is important.

=== Note by Note ===
Once you figure out how far you need to transpose, just think that in your head for every note. For example, for D horn you need to transpose every note down a minor third (three half steps). When you come to a third space C, you think a minor third below that and play an A.

=== Clef Transposition ===
Pretend the written music has a different clef. &lt;!--Flesh this out --&gt;

=== Tricks ===
* B&amp;#x266d; Horn - If you have a double horn, as most people do, you can use F horn fingerings on the B&amp;#x266d; side of the horn. This does not work for all fingerings, but if you are in doubt, it can come in handy.

* C Horn - This is similar to B&amp;#x266d; horn, but instead use B&amp;#x266d; fingerings on the F side of the horn. Again this is not fool-proof and does not work for all fingerings.

== Old Notation ==

Old Notation was the practice of notating bass clef Horn parts a fourth BELOW sounding pitch instead of a fifth ABOVE sounding pitch, which is the standard today.  

These parts should be played an octave above the written pitch.  A good indicator of old notation is the presence of a pedal C (C2) or lower.  

In modern composition, old notation should never be used.  It is outdated and unnecessary.

There are many ways that technology can be used to enhance mathematics instruction.  It can be as simple as using a calculator for basic calculations or as complex as using graphing calculators to create graphs or a geometric drawing program to investigate geometric properties and formulas.

The following are types of techology that can be used to enhance mathematics instruction:

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several types of saws for cutting wood. Some are used to make straight cuts and others are used to make curved cuts.

The two main types of handsaws in the western world are the crosscut saw and the ripsaw. The teeth on a ripsaw are like a row of chisels, each used to sever a fiber of wood as they pass parallel to the grain.  The teeth on a crosscut saw are like a row of knives, each used to slice across the wood fiber as they pass perpendicular to the grain.  As its name suggests, a crosscut saw is used to cut wood perpendicular or at an angle to the wood grain.  The crosscut saw typically has more teeth per inch than the ripsaw.  A crosscut saw can also be used to cut plywood. The ripsaw is only used to cut wood in the same direction as the grain. The ripsaw makes a very rough and ragged cut when used to cut across the grain. The crosscut saw is a better all-purpose saw since you can cut with or against the grain. Although it can tend to follow the wood grain and make it harder to make a straight cut with the grain.

Both of these western handsaws cut on the push stroke. Japanese saws, on the other hand, cut on the pull stroke. The advantage of the Japanese saw is the width of the blade can be much thinner because you are using the steel in tension. Western style saws are much thicker because they will buckle if they are too thin.  An exception is the backsaw used by cabinetmakers. This saw has a very thin blade with a high tooth count (for cleaner cuts) and a stiffener across the top of the blade to keep it from buckling.

The compass or keyhole saw is a short, narrow-bladed crosscut saw used for getting into tight spaces or for making circular cuts 

The coping or fret saw has a narrow fine-toothed blade held in a c-shaped body and is used to make circular cuts and to for cope (trim) molding to fit snugly.

The hacksaw has a very fine-toothed, narrow blade and is used for cutting through metals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Correspondence Learning==
The student receives a set of learning materials via mail. The traditional set included textbooks, student guides, and assignments that the student is obliged to do within the specified time. No teacher support is provided. Later this form of learning is combined with the educational radio and TV programs. But in general this form of learning doesn't include any kind of feedback and communication with other participants of the educational process. At those times students and teachers saw each other only within exam sessions.

Traditional correspondence education assumes that learners should work with various educational materials received by the mail. The learner also should send back written assignments and results of his individual research activities.

{{spice}}

'''Marjoram''' is a cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavors. It is also called sweet marjoram or knotted marjoram.

Marjoram's aromatic leaves are used either green or dry for culinary purposes; the tops are cut as the plants begin to flower and are dried slowly in the shade. It is often used in herb combinations such as Herbes de Provence and [[Cookbook:Za'atar|Za'atar]].

Marjoram is very similar to [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], a herb from the same family. Oregano is stronger in flavour, marjoram is sweeter and milder. If a recipe requires marjoram, you may substitute oregano for it, but only use ⅔ as much as the recipe states.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Broadcasting Courses==
The TV and radio broadcasting for educational purposes is widely used for teaching. Very often TV programs are integrated into the curriculum in addition to the existing face-to-face educational programs (for example, taped demonstration of the lectures of the famous scientists, Nobel prize laureates, etc). The feedback is organized in a form of the e-mail and asynchronous conferences. Students receive the help from the teachers, and send them back the reports about the on-going projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Companies are using TV broadcasting more to broadcast open forum or town hall meetings as a type of seminar course. The seminars are live and allow for Q&amp;A session between the differant locations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)==
Having a personal computer at home the student could learn the subject by various interactive educational software programs, that are delivered in most cases in a form of an educational toolkit with software and courseware materials (textbooks, guides for self-instruction, learning tools, etc). The student could work with these materials at his home computer, or could get the access to the same educational resources, but published on the appropriate Internet web site. Distance education supported by educational software programs could be the part of the traditional educational process or the dominating form of education, organized, for instance, in a form of so-called learning environments, or learning spaces, virtual laboratories, etc. As a rule, the feedback in such cases is provided by e-mail and teleconferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This form of distance education could be developed in the Internet environment with the help of the interactive Web-based textbooks, e-mail, mailing lists, chats, asynchronous forums, computer modeling and simulation programs, etc. Teaching on the Net could be integrated with other forms and methods of distance teaching, enlisted above (for example, with broadcasting courses).

There are several types of web courses that refer to the various levels that they are used within the web that should be pointed out.

o A '''web-presence''' course would have all the general information about the course but does not provide any instruction.

o A '''web-enhanced''' course will take advantage of the web technology to distribute the course materials.

o The '''web-centric''' course makes more use of the web technology for greater access and interaction to course materials and even communications between teacher-to-students, student-to-student.

o Full '''web-courses''' can be accessed anywhere and anytime. These courses take full advantage of web technology for communication and interaction between teacher, students, and course materials 

In her monograph [[http://www.pfhe.org/institute/twigg/]], &quot;Innovations in Online Learning: Moving Beyond No Significant Difference,&quot; Dr. Carol A. Twigg says that web-based distance learning can run the gamut from &quot;teacher-led distance learning programs... to more innovative, learner-centered programs that rely on a combination of high quality, interactive learningware, asynchronous and synchronous conversations, and individualized mentoring...&quot;

'''Dill''' is a short-lived, European, annual herb. Both the fern-like leaves and the seed are used.

Dill leaves (called '''dill weed''') are used to flavor many foods, such as [[Cookbook:Borscht|borscht]] and [[Cookbook:Gravlax|gravlax]]. It is a popular herb used in various ways with [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], and works well with [[Cookbook:Cream|creamy]] [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]].

'''Dill seeds''' can be used much like [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]] and [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] seeds, sprinkled over [[Cookbook:Casserole|casseroles]] and [[Cookbook:Bread|breads]], and in [[Cookbook:Salad|salad dressings]]. Dill seed has long been used to make teas for helping with digestive problems.

Both the seeds and the leaves are commonly used to flavor [[Cookbook:Pickle|cucumber pickles]].

The green seed pods of the plant are dried and the seeds inside the pod are used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian]] cuisine either whole or in a ground form. Ground cardamom is a primary ingredient of curry powder. In the Middle East, cardamom is used to flavour coffee or tea.

Cardamom can also be spelled cardamon or cardomom and in India is popularly known as elaichi.

'''Cloves''' are the aromatic dried buds of a tree native to Indonesia, used as a spice in virtually all the world's cuisine. They can be used in cooking either whole or in a ground form, but they are extremely strong so they are used sparingly. 

One use of cloves is as flavouring in stewed [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]].

When I first saw this wikibook, and all the edits, I thought it would be a great rescource for Learning languages autonomously using machines.  It's not.  It's basically a guide to the internet.  If you want to put a guide to the internet, make a wikibook called... Internet Guide.  Not ATALL.

----
The Internet is certainly a large part of ATALL.  But ATALL is not limited to the Internet.  There is information here (and will be more) on radio, TV, DVD movies, MP3 players, telephone and other forms of non-Internet technology as well.

== Orphaned Wikibook module ==

The following is a module that may have some connection to this Wikibook:

*[[Introduction to Rich Internet Applications for ATALL]]

If it doesn't seem to fit here, you can either try to find a better fitting Wikibook (unlikely, but possible) or simply tag it for deletion by inserting the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|Wikibook cleanup}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to let the admins know that it is something that should be looked at closer.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:15, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:'''''Give a teacher a way to teach students to become autonomous technology-assisted language learners, and you teach them and their students for a lifetime. Write a computer program to give the teachers the same skills, and it may or may not end up being less work.''''' (Anonymous, 2006)

== Vokaler ~ Vowels ==

There are nine vowels in the Danish/Norwegian alphabet, '''a''', '''e''', '''i''',
'''o''', '''u''', '''y''', '''æ''', '''ø''' and '''å'''. For people who only speak English they are often not pronounced quite the way you would expect.

The five first vowels are pronounced as in most European languages other than
English. 

* '''a''' is pronounced almost as the English '''a'''
* '''i''' is pronounced as '''ee''' in '''bee''' or the '''e''' in '''R''e''ba'''.
* '''y''' is pronounced as '''ee''' in '''bee''' but with rounded lips. This sound does not occur in English, but it's similar to the French ''t'''u''''' or German '''ü'''.
* '''æ''' is pronounced 1) as in ''h'''a'''t'' or 2) as in '''''a'''ny'' or '''''e'''nd''.
* '''ø''' is pronounced as in '''''ea'''rn'' or ''h'''ur'''t''.
* '''å''' is pronounced 1) as '''''awe''''' and '''''or''''' or 2) sort of like as in ''n'''o''''' or ''l'''o'''w''.

It is important to distinguish between ''long'' and ''short'' 
vowels. A short vowel is often indicated by doubling the consonant ''after'' 
it. 
&lt;!-- An example would be nice here. But the Norwegian does not work in Danish
For example '''hat''' with a long '''a''' means ''hate'', while '''hatt'''
with a short '''a''' means ''hat''.--&gt;

For instance '''skulle''' with a short '''u''' means '''should''', but '''at skule''' means '''to stare'''. '''Pile''' means '''darts''', but '''pille''' means '''pill'''.

== Konsonanter ~ Consonants ==

'''b''', '''f''', '''h''', '''k''', '''l''', '''m''', '''n''',
'''p''', '''s''', '''t''' and '''v''' are pronounced more or less as in
English.

*'''d''' is silent if found after an ''n'', as in ''hen'''d'''e''. If doubled in the middle of a word, as in ''he'''dd'''er'', it is pronounced as ''th'' in the English '''''th'''e'' or ''te'''th'''er''. The '''d''' can also take on the sound of a hard d, &quot;at '''d'''ykke&quot; (meaning, &quot;to '''d'''ive&quot; where the '''d''''s are pronounced the same).
*'''g''' is usually pronounced as in '''''g'''uess''. Sometimes pronounced as a soft ''g'' if the word is of foreign origin, for example: ''teenagere''
*'''j''' is pronounced as the ''y'' in '''''y'''es''.


'''c''', '''q''', '''w''', '''x''' and '''z''' are mainly used in foreign words.

*'''c''' is pronounced as '''s''' when it comes before '''e''', '''i''', '''y''' and '''æ''', and as '''k''' in all other cases. (Exception: '''Cypern''' (meaning '''Cyprus''') is pronounced with a '''k''' sound))

*'''q''' is pronounced as '''k'''.

*'''w''' is pronounced as '''v''' (never as English ''w''.)

*'''x''' is pronounced as '''s''' if it is the ''first'' letter in a word and is pronounced as '''ks''' if it is ''not''.

*'''z''' is pronounced as '''s'''. 

*'''r''' is pronounced almost as French/German '''r''' but more &quot;smoothe&quot;, without the vibrating sound.

Note that Danish does not have the voiced ''z''-sound, so Danish '''s''', '''x''' and '''z''' are never pronounced as in English ''is'', ''example'' or ''zoo''.


Eksempler ~ Examples:

''xylofon''  ('''x''' pronounced like '''s''')

''fox''  ('''x''' pronounced like '''ks''')

'''Saffron''' is the dried stigma and part of the style of the saffron crocus. It has a pleasant spicy smell, and it contains a dye that colours food a distinctive deep golden colour. It is one of the most expensive of all spices, because of the labour-intensive way it is prepared. Saffron has been described as metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes, while its taste has been noted also as hay-like and somewhat bitter. Saffron contributes a luminous yellow-orange colour to whatever you put it in. 

Saffron is used in many [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] recipes, including [[Cookbook:Paella|paella]] and [[Cookbook:Fabada Asturiana|fabada Asturiana]], and in the most famous saffron-based [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] dish, the [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]] alla milanese. Outside Europe, it is a vital ingredient of many [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South and Central Asian]], and [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Arabian]] dishes. 

[[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]] is sometimes used as a substitute; although it gives a similar colour, it has none of the real saffron taste. 

==Preparation==

Saffron should always be soaked in hot (not boiling) water before use, about three times as much water as saffron. If you have the time, it is best to soak the whole saffron strands for about 2 hours. Otherwise, soak for at least 20 minutes, then crush the strands of saffron with the back of a spoon, to release the flavours and colour in to the water. Add the saffron and soak water to the rest of the ingredients, as directed by the recipe.

[[Image:Salvia officinalis2.jpg|200px|thumb|Sage leaves]]
'''Sage''' is a herb, the leaf of a perennial plant that can be grown in most climates.

It has a slight peppery flavour and in Western cooking it is used for flavouring fatty meats (especially as part of a [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinade]]), [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]], and some drinks. In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Belgium|Flanders]], sage is used with [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] for [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|poultry]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Stuffing|stuffing]] and also in sauces. In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]], sage is used for cooking white meat and in vegetable soups. [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germans]] often use it in sausage dishes. Sage is also common in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian cooking]]. In the Balkans and the Middle East, it is used when roasting [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]].

Whole branches of sage may be laid in the bottom of a roasting pan when [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] chicken and other meats, to prevent the meat from sticking to the bottom of the pan. The sage then imparts its flavour to the meat, and other items in the oven. The pan drippings are also infused with sage, making for a delicious [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In Italian, most verbs end in a common pattern, such as '''-are''', '''-ere''', and '''-ire'''. These are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd conjugations respectively.

==Present tense (Presente indicativo)==

The present tense in Italian is essentially the same as in English. The only difference is that it can also be used as the present continuous, so &quot;I do&quot; and &quot;I am doing&quot; are conjugated the same way. The English present continuous, however, is expressed in a better way by a more complex construction with the verb &quot;stare&quot; and the &quot;gerundio&quot; form (the English -ing form).

Also note that the subject pronoun can be dropped from a conjugated verb because the ending of the conjugated verb communicates the subject of the action.

====Present Tense Conjugations 1, 2 and 3====
{{expand}}{{confusing|what is 1, 2 and 3?}}
Category 1 words in the infinitive end in ARE:for example parlare (to speak), giocare (to play), amare (to love) and so on.
Similarly, category 2 words in the infinitive end in ERE: vendere (to sell), vedere (to see).
Category 3 words in the infinitive end in IRE. There two (2) subcategories of this case: those requiring no special treatment and those 
requiring an ISC be inserted prior to inserting the ending. Some authors have classified the second subcategory as class 3 and the first
subcategory as class 4, thus reclassifying to 4 cases. 
Using this method, in class 3 we have: capire (to understand), finire (to finish),preferire (to prefer)
and in class 4 we have: sentire (to feel),dormire (to sleep)  
To conjugate regular verbs follow this method:

# Drop the ending from the infinitive to give the stem.&lt;br&gt;Eg.: ''lavorare (to work) → lavor-''&lt;br&gt;
# Add the correct ending:&lt;br&gt;Eg.: ''lavorare → lavor- → lavoro''

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!person !! -are !! -ere !! -ire
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| 
|-
| io || -o || -o || -o 
|-
| tu || -i || -i || -i 
|-
| lui/lei || -a || -e || -e 
|-
| noi || -iamo || -iamo || -iamo 
|-
| voi || -ate || -ete || -ite 
|-
| loro || -ano || -ono || -ono
|-
|}


So, for example, ''parlare'' (to speak) would be conjugated as follows:

:(Io) parlo (&quot;I speak / am speaking&quot;)
:(Tu) parli (&quot;You speak / you are speaking&quot;)
:(Egli/ella/Lei/Lui) parla
:(Noi) parliamo
:(Voi) parlate
:(Essi/Loro) parlano

Note:  Words ''egli'', ''ella'', and ''essi'' are older versions of ''lui'', ''lei'', and ''loro'', respectively, but are still used occasionally today.

====3rd Conjugation Verbs taking &quot;-isc-&quot;====

Many 3rd Conjugation verbs add the letters '''-isc-''' between the stem and the ending for the present tense. This is constructed as follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!person !! ire !!
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| 
|-
                                               ''finire''(to end/finish)

| io || -isco ||                               io finisco
|-
| tu || -isci ||                               tu finisci
|-
| lui/lei/Lei|| -isce ||                      lui/lei/Lei finisce
|-
| noi || -iamo ||                              noi finiamo
|-
| voi || -ite ||                               voi finite
|-
| loro || -iscono ||                           loro finiscono
|-
|}

Remember that, when followed by i or e, -sc- sounds like the English 'shake' (/ʃ/). If ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'' follow, -sc- will be read as in the English word 'sky' (/sk/).

==The Present Perfect (Passato Prossimo)==
The Passato Prossimo is one of the most commonly used past tenses in Italian. It is a compound tense, therefore the auxiliary verbs ''avere'' and ''essere'' are used in conjugation. Note that the following conjugations are both irregular.

{{col-begin|width=60%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|- 
| io || ho
|- 
| tu || hai 
|-
| lui/lei || ha
|-
| noi || abbiamo 
|-
| voi || avete 
|-
| loro || hanno
|-
|}

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Essere (to be)
|- 
| io || sono
|- 
| tu || sei 
|-
| lui/lei || è
|-
| noi || siamo 
|-
| voi || siete 
|-
| loro || sono
|-
|}

{{col-end}}

===The Past Participle===
The past participle is used with the verbs avere and essere to form the passato prossimo.  To form the past participle, the ending of the verb (-are, -ere, -ire) are changed as follows:
*verbs ending in -are take -ato for their past participle (e.g.: ''parlare'' → ''parlato'')
*verbs ending in -ere take -uto for their past participle (e.g.: ''cadere'' → ''caduto'')
*verbs ending in -ire take -ito for their past participle (e.g.: ''finire'' → ''finito'')

Note that the past participle of ''avere'' is ''avuto'' and the past participle of ''essere'' is ''stato''.

===Formation of the Passato Prossimo with ''Avere''===
To form the passato prossimo, you have to use avere or essere plus the past participle.  Most verbs take avere for the passato prossimo; all reflexive verbs take essere and a few select verbs of motion take essere.

For now, we deal with the verbs that take ''avere''. First, you conjugate ''avere'' for the appropriate subject, then place the past participle after it; an example follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Parlare (to speak)
|- 
| io || ho || parlato
|- 
| tu || hai || parlato 
|-
| lui/lei || ha || parlato
|-
| noi || abbiamo || parlato
|-
| voi || avete || parlato
|-
| loro || hanno || parlato
|-
|}

The literal translation of this is &quot;I have spoken&quot;, &quot;you have spoken&quot;, &quot;he/she has spoken&quot;, etc.  However, this tense is the main past tense used in Italian and can be loosely translated as &quot;I spoke&quot;, &quot;you spoke&quot;, &quot;he/she spoke&quot;, etc.
Note that almost all verbs are conjugated this way with the passato prossimo.

===Formation of the Passato Prossimo with ''Essere''===
The passato prossimo is generally conjugated with ''avere''; however there are some situations in which ''essere'' is used. Many verbs of motion as well as all the reflexive verbs, require ''essere''.

Some of the most common verbs that take ''essere'' are:
*arrivare (to arrive) 
*andare (to go)  
*uscire (to go out) 
*entrare (to enter) 
*venire as venuto (to come)
*essere as stato (to be) 
*partire (to leave) 
*stare as stato (to stay, to be) 
*sparire (to disappear) 
*tornare (to come back/return)
*nascere as nato (to be born)
*morire as morto (to die)
*rimanere as rimasto (to remain) 
Note that irregular past participles are in parentheses.

And before we get to an example, there is just one other difference between ''essere'' and ''avere'' for the passato prossimo.  While in conjugations with ''avere'', the past participle does not agree with the subject, it must in ''essere''.

E.g., when a feminine subject wants to say 'I spoke', she would say 'io ho parlat'''o''''. But if she wants to say 'I was', she would use ''essere'' and the respective form of the participle: 'io sono stat'''a''''. Similar changes occur for plural subjects, such as ''noi'', which can have a past participle ending in -i or -e. An example of a passato prossimo with ''essere'' follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Nascere (to be born)
|- 
| io || sono || nato/a
|- 
| tu || sei || nato/a 
|-
| lui/lei || è || nato/a
|-
| noi || siamo || nati/e
|-
| voi || siete || nati/e
|-
| loro || sono || nati/e
|-
|}

==The Future Indicative (Il futuro indicativo)==
The future indicative is the equivalent of 'will + a verb' or 'be going to + a verb' in English.  It is not a compound tense in Italian (it is not formed with ''avere''/''essere'' like the passato prossimo).

The verbs ''avere'' and ''essere'' are irregular in the future indicative.  Their conjugations are:

{{col-begin|width=60%}}
{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Essere (to be)
|- 
| io || sarò
|- 
| tu || sarai
|-
| lui/lei || sarà
|-

|-

|-

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Avere (to have)
|- 
| io || avrò
|- 
| tu || avrai
|-
| lui/lei || avrà
|-
| noi || avremo
|-
| voi || avrete
|-
| loro || avranno
|-
|}

{{col-end}}

===Regular Verbs in the Future Tense / Verbi regolari al futuro ===
The verbs ending by -are and -ere are conjugated by adding the same set of endings for the future indicative. These endings are ''-erò'', ''-erai'', ''-erà'', ''-eremo'', ''-erete'', and ''-eranno''.

The endings for -ire verbs are similar but exactly the same; the difference is that the first ''e'' of the ending is replaced by ''i''. Therefore the endings are: ''-irò'',''-irai'', ''-irà'', ''-iremo'', ''-irete'', ''-iranno''.

{{col-begin|width=90%}}
{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Parlare (to speak)
|- 
| io || parlerò
|- 
| tu || parlerai
|-
| lui/lei || parlerà
|-
| noi || parleremo
|-
| voi || parlerete
|-
| loro || parleranno
|-
|}

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Vendere (to sell)
|- 
| io || venderò
|- 
| tu || venderai
|-
| lui/lei || venderà
|-
| noi || venderemo
|-
| voi || venderete
|-
| loro || venderanno
|-
|}

{{col-break|width=30%}}

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Finire (to finish)
|- 
| io || finirò
|- 
| tu || finirai
|-
| lui/lei || finirà
|-
| noi || finiremo
|-
| voi || finirete
|-
| loro || finiranno
|-
|}

{{col-end}}

There is a small group of verbs whose infinitive ends with ''-gare'' or ''-care''. In the formation of the future indicative, these verbs require an ''h'' to keep the consistency with the rules of pronunciation. An example of such case follows:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; background:#dedede&quot;| Dimenticare (to forget)
|- 
| io || dimentic'''h'''erò
|- 
| tu || dimentic'''h'''erai
|-
| lui/lei || dimentic'''h'''erà
|-
| noi || dimentic'''h'''eremo
|-
| voi || dimentic'''h'''erete
|-
| loro || dimentic'''h'''eranno
|-
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==
'''Role Theory''' proposed that human behavior is guided by expectations held both by the individual and by other people.  The expectations correspond to different roles individuals ''perform'' or ''enact'' in their daily lives, such as secretary, father, or friend. For instance, most people hold pre-conceived notions of the role expectations of a secretary, which might include: answering phones, making and managing appointments, filing paperwork, and typing memos.  These role expectations would not be expected of a professional soccer player...

Individuals generally have and manage many roles. Roles consist of a set of rules or norms that function as plans or blueprints to guide behavior. Roles specify what goals should be pursued, what tasks must be accomplished, and what performances are required in a given scenario or situation. Role theory holds that a substantial proportion of observable, day-to-day social behavior is simply persons carrying out their roles, much as actors carry out their roles on the stage or ballplayers theirs on the field.  Role theory is, in fact, predictive.  It implies that if we have information about the role expectations for a specified position (e.g., sister, fireman, prostitute), a significant portion of the behavior of the persons occupying that position can be predicted.

What's more, role theory also argues that in order to change behavior it is necessary to change roles; roles correspond to behaviors and vice versa.  In addition to heavily influencing behavior, roles influence beliefs and attitudes; individuals will change their beliefs and attitudes to correspond with their roles.  For instance, someone over-looked for a promotion to a managerial position in a company may change their beliefs about the benefits of management by convincing him/herself that they didn't want the additional responsibility that would have accompanied the position.

Many role theorists see ''Role Theory'' as one of the most compelling theories bridging individual behavior and social structure.  Roles, which are in part dictated by social structure and in part by social interactions (see the two approaches outlined below), guide the behavior of the individual.  The individual, in turn, influences the norms, expectations, and behaviors associated with roles.  The understanding is reciprocal and didactic.

===Structural-Functional Perspective===
The functionalist approach sees a ''role'' as the set of expectations that society places on an individual. By unspoken consensus, certain behaviours are deemed ''appropriate'' and others ''inappropriate''. For example, it is appropriate for a doctor to dress fairly conservatively, ask a series of personal questions about one's health, touch one in ways that would normally be forbidden, write prescriptions, and show more concern for the personal well-being of their clients.  Electricians or shopkeepers may also show concern for the well-being of their clients, but if they start touching their clients, especially where doctors are allowed to touch, they'll get in trouble; they will have stepped outside of the norms associated with their roles.

In the functionalist conception, role is one of the important ways in which individual activity is socially regulated: roles create regular patterns of behaviour and thus a measure of predictability, which not only allows individuals to function effectively because they know what to expect of others, but also makes it possible for the sociologist to make generalisations about society. Collectively, a group of interlocking roles creates a social institution: the institution of law, for example, can be seen as the combination of many roles, including: ''police officer'', ''judge'', ''criminal'', and ''victim''.

Roles, in the functionalist perspective, are relatively inflexible and are more-or-less universally agreed upon. Although it is recognised that different roles interact (''teacher'' and ''student''), and that roles are usually defined in relation to other roles (''doctor'' and ''patient'' or ''mother'' and ''child''), the functionalist approach has great difficulty in accounting for variability and flexibility of roles and finds it difficult to account for the vast differences in the way that individuals conceive different roles. Taken to extremes, the functionalist approach results in ''role'' becoming a set of static, semi-global expectations laid down by a unified, amorphous society. The distinction between ''role'' and ''norm'' (or ''culture'') thus becomes sterile.

The functionalist approach has been criticized for its static understanding of roles. Even so, it remains a fundamental concept which is still taught in most introductory courses and is still regarded as important.

Interestingly, this conception has crossed over from academic discourse into popular use. It has become commonplace to speak of particular ''roles'' as if they were indeed fixed, agreed upon by all, and uncontroversial (e.g., ''the role of the teacher'' or ''a parent's role''). This everyday usage nearly always employs ''role'' in a normative way, to imply that ''this is the proper behaviour'' for a teacher or a parent, or even for an entire institution.

===Interactionist Perspective===
The interactionist definition of ''role'' is more fluid and subtle than the functionalist perspective. A ''role'', in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals. 

One of the ways Mead explained the idea of roles was by using a development model for children.  According to Mead, children adopt roles in the development of a self. In so doing, they pass through three stages:

#preparatory stage - meaningless imitation by the infant; assumes roles but doesn't understand what they are
#play stage - actual playing of roles occurs; but no unified conception of self
#game stage - completion stage of self; child finds himself; must respond to simultaneous roles; the individual can act with a certain amount of consistency in a variety of situations because he/she acts in accordance with a generalized set of expectations and definitions he/she has internalized

Adults, of course, are beyond the game stage, but continue to adopt roles and adapt them through interpersonal interactions.  This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable ambiguity. For instance, let's assume person X has a friend who is also a lawyer; we'll call him Y. If X approaches Y as a friend but then asks for legal advice, this forces Y to either switch roles completely or merge the roles temporarily.  Until Y decides on his course of action, role ambiguity will exist.

&quot; A person should be physically, socially and spiritually strong&quot;.

===Additional Approaches===
*structural - little attention given to norms; attention is focused on social structures conceived as stable organizations of sets of persons (called social positions or statuses) who share the same, patterned behaviors (roles)
*organization - focuses on social systems that are preplanned, task-oriented, and hierarchical; roles in such organizations are assumed to be associated with identified social positions and to be generated by normative expectations
*cognitive role theory - focuses on relationships between role expectations and behavior
&lt;u&gt;(from Biddle 1986)&lt;/u&gt;

==Propositions==
Role Theory includes the following propositions:
# people spend much of their lives participating as members of groups and organizations
# within these groups, people occupy distinct positions
# each of these positions entails a role, which is a set of functions performed by the person for the group
# groups often formalize role expectations as norms or even codified rules, which include what rewards will result when roles are successfully performed and what punishments will result when roles are not successfully performed
# individuals usually carry out their roles and perform in accordance with prevailing norms; in other words, role theory assumes that people are primarily conformists who try to live up to the norms that accompany their roles
# group members check each individual's performance to determine whether it conforms with the norms; the anticipation that others will apply sanctions ensures role performance

==Extensions of the Theory==
Role Theory has been a fruitful approach to understanding humans and society.  As a result, various derivatives and additional concepts have developed.

===Role Confusion===
''Role confusion'' is a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he/she should assume. For example, if a graduate student were to attend a department party at a professor's home, the student may find it difficult to determine if he/she should act as a student toward the professor, exhibiting deference or respect, or as a friend or associate, showing collegiality and familiarity.

===Role Conflict===
''Role Conflict'' results when an individual encounters tensions as the result of incompatible roles.  For instance, a mother who is employed full-time may experience role conflict because of the norms that are associated with the two roles she has.  She may be expected to spend a great deal of time taking care of her children while simultaneously trying to advance her career.

===Role Strain===
''Role Strain'' refers to the felt difficulty in fulfilling role obligations.  In contrast to ''role conflict'', where tension is felt between two competing roles, the tension in role strain comes from just one role.  Returning to the example of a mother, if she were to find that she is unable to fulfill her obligations as defined by, say, an overly demanding spouse (or religion, or child), she would experience role strain.  The ''role expectations'' may be beyond what she is able to achieve or may push her to the limits of her abilities.

===Role Distance===
''Role Distance'' is the effectively expressed pointed separateness between the individual and his putative role. The individual is not denying the role but the virtual self that is implied in the role for all accepting performers. The concept of ''role distance'' provides a sociological means of dealing with one type of divergence between obligation and actual performance. For example, the ''maturing'' adolescent who is forced to ride a merry-go-round may display role distance by acting as though the ride does not challenge her physical abilities or frighten her.  This may be displayed by riding backwards or leaning dangerously from her horse.

Immediate audiences figure very directly in the display of role distance; actors need an audience or a co-conspirator for role distancing to work. There are two ways of establishing role distance:
#isolating one's self from the contamination of the situation, which can be displayed through indifference (e.g., a waiter saying, &quot;I'm just doing this to put myself through college.&quot;)
#joking about the situation (e.g., the young merry-go-round rider saying, &quot;I can do this with my eyes closed.&quot;)

It is often possible to determine incidents in which ''role distance'' might be displayed solely on the grounds of the performers' gross age-sex characteristics. A seventeen year-old boy riding a merry-go-round (especially with peers) will likely  display significant role distance.  

===Role Embracement===
''Role Embracement'' refers to the complete adoption of a role.  When a role is truly embraced, the self disappears completely into the role.  Three things seem to be involved in the earnestness with which people assume roles or the degree to which they embrace a role:
#an admitted or expressed attachment to the role
#a demonstration of qualifications and capacities for performing it
#an active engagement or spontaneous involvement in the role activity at hand, that is, a visible investment of attention and muscular effort

==Limitations==
Role theory has a hard time explaining social deviance when it does not correspond to a pre-specified role.  For instance, the behavior of someone who adopts the role of bank robber can be predicted - she will rob banks.  But if a bank teller simply begins handing out cash to random people, role theory would be unable to explain why (though ''role conflict'' could be one possible answer; the teller might have taken the job wanting to be a modern day Robin Hood).

Another limitation of role theory is that it does not and cannot explain how role expectations came to be what they are. Role theory has no explanation for why it is expected of male soldiers to cut their hair short, but it could predict with a high degree of accuracy that if someone is a male soldier they will have short hair.  Additionally, role theory does not explain when and how role expectations change.

==Notes==
from Batson, Schoenrade, and Ventis
p. 28 &quot;Shakespeare put it clearly in As You Like It (Act II, Scene vii):

All the world's a stage.
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts....

&quot;Many social psychologists and sociologists, most notably Erving Goffman (1959), have used this dramaturgical analogy between social life and a stage play to talk about subtle, indirect forms of social influence. In doing so, these psychologists and sociologists typically emphasize three concepts: social roles, social norms, and reference groups. Within the dramaturgical analogy, social roles are the parts to be played, social norms the script of the play, and reference groups the audience.
&quot;Social roles may be formally defined as behavior patterns that are characteristic, and expected, of a person or persons who occupy some position in a social structure. Less formally, they are the parts to be played in the social drama. Of course, playing roles in society is considerably more complex than playing a part in a play. Each of us is called on to play a number of different social roles at once. Some are very specific and well defined; others are general and ambiguous. For example, as a young man, Tony Bassillio might be called on to play simultaneously the roles of premedical student, son, brother, apartment-mate, Catholic, Democrat, part-time mechanic, fiancé, aware 20-year-old, and man. Each of these roles has its own more or less explicit script.&quot;
There's the reference I was looking for my role-theory write up.

'''Thyme''' is a herb, the leaf (fresh or dried) of a number of related plants. It is often used to flavour meats, soups and stews. It is used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]], where it is an important element in a [[Cookbook:Bouquet Garni|bouquet garni]]. It is also widely used in West Indian cuisine. In Jordan the condiment [[Cookbook:Za'atar|za'atar]] contains thyme as a vital ingredient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theory==
'''Reinforcement Theory''' proposes that social behavior is governed by external events (events outside the human psyche). The basic premise is that people will more likely perform a specific behavior if it is followed directly by the occurrence of something pleasurable or by the removal of something aversive.  Additionally, the opposite premise is also included in the theory, but tends not to have as strong of an impact on behavior: people will less likely perform a specific behavior if it is followed by something aversive or the removal of something pleasurable. One of the benefits of this approach to understanding human (and animal) behavior is that the events are observable, as compared with cognitive theories of human behavior.

The external events that play a role in reinforcement theory are referred to as stimuli.  They include any event that leads to an alteration or change in behavior.  The change in behavior induced by a stimulus is a response.

Reinforcement theory has been operationalized in a process called operant conditioning. Positive reinforcement is the contingent presentation of a stimulus following a response, resulting in an increased likelihood of the response occurring in the future. Negative reinforcement is the contingent withdrawal of a stimulus following a response, resulting in an increased likelihood of the response occurring in the future. Unconditioned reinforcement, also called primary reinforcement, is the presentation of stimuli that are inherently reinforcing, such as affection, food, sex, or sleep. Conditioned reinforcement, also called secondary reinforcement, is the presentation of a stimulus which has acquired reinforcing power through association with primary reinforcers. Social reinforcement is a form of conditioned reinforcement in which the reinforcer involves some sort of interaction with others. Positive punishment is the contingent presentation of a stimulus following a response, resulting in a decreased likelihood of the response occurring in the future, whereas negative punishment is the contingent withdrawal of a stimulus following a response, resulting in a decreased likelihood of the response occurring in the future.

Successive approximation is the presentation of reinforcers after increasingly accurate productions of the desired response. For example, in training rats or pigeons to depress a lever or peck a key, reinforcement will initially be contingent on simply turning toward the lever or key. As training progresses, the response reinforced becomes progressively more like the response desired by the trainer (i.e., actually pecking the key). Behaviours developed through the reinforcement of successive approximations to the eventual desired behaviour are called shaped behaviours and the process is called shaping.

The study of reinforcement has produced strong, replicable results. The effects of different schedules of reinforcement (i.e., variations in the rate or ratio of reinforcement) have been extensively studied. Some of these schedules include:

* Continuous reinforcement, in which a reinforcer is presented after every desired response,
* Fixed ratio, in which a reinforcer is presented after every nth response,
* Fixed interval, in which a reinforcer is presented after the passage of a specified length of time from the beginning of training or from the presentation of the last reinforcer, provided a response has been made during the period,
* Variable ratio, in which the number of responses between reinforcers varies, but on the average equals a predetermined number
* Variable interval, in which the time between reinforcers varies, but on the average equals a predetermined time.

Ratio schedules produce higher rates of responding than interval schedules, with variable ratio scales producing the highest rates of response. Variable ratio schedules produce the greatest resistance to extinction, which is the decline in response strength following the cessation of reinforcement.

==Propositions==
==Limitations==
This theoretical approach to understanding human behavior has been criticized on a number of levels.  First, it has been criticized as employing circular reasoning, since it appears to argue that response strength is increased by reinforcement while defining reinforcement as something which increases response strength. However, non-circular definitions have been proposed. For example, reinforcement can be defined as consummatory behaviour contingent on a response. 

Another limitation of this theoretical approach is that it portrays individuals as primarily reacting to environmental stimuli rather than as initiating behavior based on imaginative or creative thought.  In short, it downplays the role of cognition in human behavior.  As a result, this theoretical approach downplays the influence of other motivations in explaining human behavior.  Additionally, reinforcement theory cannot explain  selfless behavior and altruism, instances where the individual acts to their own detriment in order to help another.

Though Gujarati has its own set of numeric signs (placed alongside their Hindu-Arabic [or Indo-Arabic] counterparts in the tables below), they are employed in much the same way as English employs its own; that is to say, they are put together in the same manner in order to express larger numbers. It is quite possible to simply substitute the Gujarati numerals for the Hindu-Arabic ones.

The Gujarati words for 1-10 are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

Sadly, the words for eleven through nineteen are completely irregular in Gujarati. Though they do bear some resemblance to their 1-10 counterparts, they must simply be individually memorized:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Real water waves are exceedingly complex, however it is fortunate that a great number of observations can be explained on the basis of the small amplitude wave theory which makes many assumptions, but simplifies the mathematics involved considerably. The problem that is to be solved is essentially a boundary value problem. In order to solve this problem, we need to find the differential equation, and the conditions at the boundaries. We first begin by formulating the problem as a boundary value problem.

==Problem Formulation==
===Differential equation===
We are given that water waves form in some water body. What we need to find out are the essential properties of these waves and what parameters govern them. In short we need to develop a theory of water waves. The first step towards this end will be to find out what properties hold good in the water body while there are waves on its free surface.

Let us assume that the fluid is incompressible and only irrotational motion takes place. Basic hydrodynamics tells us that a velocity potential will exist which will satisfy the continuity equation. Therefore, the following equation will hold.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;
In three dimensions, this is the Laplace equation and is written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial ^2 \phi}{\partial z^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The Laplace equation is linear and therefore any solutions can be combined linearly to yield more solutions. Furthermore, there are many solutions to the equation and not all are valid for our problem. We will pick our solution depending on the boundary conditions.

===Bottom Boundary Conditions===
At the bottom, we basically see that the kinematic conditions must be satisfied. What this means is that at any interface, there must be no flow across the interface. The fluid cannot flow across the bottom. It is this limitation that we need to express in the form of an equation to form the bottom boundary condition.
If we imagine that we are fixed with respect to the surface, the total derivative of the water surface will be zero, since we move with the surface. Thus on any surface, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{DF(x,y,z,t)}{Dt}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying this equation leads us to the result that 

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{u}\cdot\vec{n}=\frac{\partial F/ \partial t}{|\nabla F|}&lt;/math&gt; on the bottom surface.

Let us now imagine that we have a bottom described by &lt;math&gt;z = h(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. The above formulation if the condition leads us to the simple result that 

:&lt;math&gt;u\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial h}{\partial y} + w = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Free Surface Boundary Conditions===
As far as the free surface conditions are concerned, there are two basic conditions that must be met. First, the kinematic condition must be taken up as described in the case of the development of the bottom boundary condition and then we also need to take up the dynamic free surface condition.

====Kinematic Free Surface Condition====
As described above, the kinematic condition is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{DF(x,y,z,t)}{Dt}=w&lt;/math&gt;

If the surface is defined by &lt;math&gt;z = \eta(x,y,t)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;w = \left. \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}  \right\|_{z=\eta(x,y,t)}&lt;/math&gt;

====Dynamic Free Surface Condition====
The water surface is not a fixed surface, nor is it a surface that can resist pressure variations. Thus the pressure on the surface is taken constant and the following equation holds on the surface.

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} (u^2 + v^2 + w^2) +gz  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===Lateral Conditions===
These conditions depend on the specifics of the problem. It may require modeling of a beach or a wave maker. We will ignore this part of the problem for now and do an analysis having no lateral limits. We will study some lateral conditions later.
===Other Conditions===
Apart from the aforementioned boundary conditions, from the physical nature of the problem we see that the solution must be periodic in both space and time.
==Solution==
If we are looking for solutions that are waves, assume that the surface is &lt;math&gt; \eta(x,y,t) = a \cos(kx + ly - \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;.  Given this choice of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary conditions suggest that the potential should be in the form

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x,y,z,t) = f(z) \sin(kx+ly-\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

After applying the dynamic free surface boundary condition, we arrive at the dispersion relation

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^2 = gk \tanh(kH) &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt; c = \sqrt{g/k \tanh(kH)} &lt;/math&gt;

==Special Cases==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Calculators are a very controversial issue in the classroom. Some people feel that it is effective in changing students' attitudes toward math and that it gives them the opportunity to experience realistic applications. On the other hand, there are teachers and parents who expect students to be able to do basic mathematical operations mentally or at least with paper and pencil.  However, some students truly struggle with basic mathematic calculations (ex: memorizing multiplication facts, long division and operations with fractions).


'''Website on the Benefits of Calculator Use in Mathematics Classrooms ''' http://education.ti.com/us/resources/research/therole.html

This links to a site that outlines the benefits of calculator use in mathematics classrooms from Kindergarten through the University level. Calculators are tools for doing mathematical computations. This site describes how calculators, when used appropriately, can also be a tool for learning mathematics. Appropriate use of calculators is a way of increasing the amount and the quality of learning afforded students during the course of their mathematics education.  Be careful however, the site is sponsored by Texas Instruments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Individualized Education Program ==
[[http://www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html IEP]] stands for Individualized Education Program and is the plan agreed upon by the parents/guardians and educators for every child that is designated as needing special education. They are reviewed yearly and altered if needed.

=== Examples of IEP goals and objectives: ===
The student will develop/increase their math application skills by identifying/using graphs and tables to obtain information 80% of the time on an informal test.

The student will develop/increase vocabulary and word recognition skills by recognizing/recalling common sight words, critical sight words: colors, numbers, months, days of the week, Dolch list, survival words 8 out of 10 tries.

=== Customizing for the IEP Using Reusable Learning Objects ===
In a nutshell, special education is customizing lessons to meet each students’ needs. Reusable learning objects will allow teachers to do just that. Students in special education need to be exposed to the same information as their regular education peers, but not necessarily in the same format. Since students with the same disability can function at different levels, it is very difficult to find a textbook to accommodate a given group of students. Another problem with textbooks is that they are usually written at grade level. Students with disabilities often do not read at grade level. They need other ways to access the information.

A well constructed learning object deals with a single idea or chunk of content. A teacher can string these objects together to create or support a lesson. Searching through learning object depositories, teachers would be able to review objects and find ones that met the needs of their students. Because RLO's are digital, they are limited only by the creativity of the author. The issue of reading level could perhaps be avoided by finding an object that taught through animation. Sound can also be incorporated into learning objects to assist with the reading level issue. as well, or for those student whose learning modality is more aural than visual. They may also need to have the content presented differently, or in a number of ways before they get the meaning. This can be easily accomplished with this digital medium.

In some cases, templates are available. Using a template for a learning object, even teachers with minimal experience can provide numerous opportunities for learning. Once a student is familiar with the interactivity of the particular learning object, the no longer have to worry about what to do and can focus on learning the content. For many students in special education, reading and following directions can be a problem. If a student is familiar with a particular format they can work on their own without having to wait for instructions.

Memory is also an issue for many students in special education. Some need a great deal more exposure to the content than their peers. If the teacher is also the author of the learning object he/she would be able to easily personalize these objects to make them more meaningful to the student. More importantly, they could be tailored to address the specific objectives from that student's IEP. Building quizzes and tests into the objects would also allow the student and the teacher to monitor the student's progress.

More and more, teachers are expected to individualize instruction. Reusable learning objects can make this much easier. Textbooks are expensive and districts aren't likely to purchase individual ones for students as teachers might like. Specialized packets aren't any more practical in the long run. The costs of paper and the purchasing and maintaining of copiers is a constant packets is extrememly time-consuming for teachers. Storing all these accumulated materials also gets to be a problem over time. Eventually, closets and storerooms become filled with leftover materials that either did not work out as expected or were extra because many materials have to be ordered in specified quantities.

Initially, creating and/or retrieving learing objects may be time-consuming, but, once assembled, the teacher need just review and edit them for use with another student and/or class. No more flipping through workbooks and hours in front of a copier or rummaging through dusty closets. With a well-organized favorites folder and a few clicks of a mouse, teachers will be able to construct customized lessons and for students that genuinely reflect the goals and objectives on their IEP's.

'''Brining''' is the process of soaking food in a solution of salt and water. Although a brine only requires salt and water, it is common to add flavouring agents to the brine as osmotic pressure will circulate any solutes in the brine throughout much of the food.

Brining is typically used for various types of [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], as well as [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]. It can also be used to process [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]], with [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]] being a common example.

{{see also|Cookbook:Marinating}}

== Modern Uses in Home Recipes ==
Brining is a technique used by modern cooks to improve the juiciness and tenderness of meat, such as [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|lean pork]], that may dry out due to modern breeding practices.

Commonly, meat is soaked in a brine solution overnight, then taken out of the brine and [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] or [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]].  The result is juicier than without brining.  Brining can affect the texture of the meat a little, but the flavor can be much improved.

==Introduction==
A self-replicating automaton is a mechanism which construct copies of itself; generally, it is assumed that building materials come from the environment hosting the automaton.  Abstract models were first developed by John von Neumann in the late 1940s, termed kinematic and tessellation models.  The kinematic model is based on now modern notions of robotics.  The tessellation model is now know as cellular automata.

The origins of self-replicating code could be traced back to simple pranks and geek humour. The reluctance of society to accept inevitable changes and its inherent suspicion - both gifts of its adaptive response for survival - as well as the social animals' craving for individuality has resulted in these interesting forms being looked upon as a contagion rather than primary stages of artificial life.

This view of being a contagion has in turn influenced the whole linguistics of the community which itself is composed of “virus writers” and “anti virus writers”. Continuing the tradition it  is sincerely hoped that every time the term &quot;virus&quot; is used it is in good humor.

Few highlights in the evolution of the present automaton are now discussed. Detailed analysis will follow in the [[SRA:Evolution|Evolution]] section.

== The 80s ==
By 1990 at least 50 viruses affecting IBM PCs and around 15 viruses affecting the Apple Mac machines were well known (analysed and studied by the antiviral community).

It is generally accepted that the first virus to spread in the wild was [[SRA:Elk Cloner|Elk Cloner]] which spread on Apple II floppy disks.It appeared around 1981-82. This period was followed by the legendary paper by Fred Cohen. By 1986 there were many strains of [[SRA:Brain|Brain]] virus prevalent. It was a boot sector infector. The common story is that it originated in Pakistan, its authors being two brothers. Virdem, the first file infector also emerged in the same year.

In 1984, A. K. Dewdney introduced the game &quot;[[w:Core War|Core War]]&quot; to the public, in an article in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewdney |first=A.&amp;nbsp;K. |authorlink=Alexander Dewdney |year=1984 |month=May |title=In the game called Core War hostile programs engage in a battle of bits. |journal=Scientific American |url=http://corewar.co.uk/vogtmann/first.htm |accessdate=2008-11-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, many file infectors started appearing, especially infecting COMMAND.COM The first one of these is considered to be [[SRA:Lehigh|Lehigh]] virus. The file infectors mainly concentrated on the simple binary format or COM files. But research  on how to develop EXE infectors was also going on. This culminated in the production of the [[SRA:Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] virus family. The Concept of Worms, code which is able to self replicate without infection, was also well developed by this time. Christmas Worm, with a high replication rate infected the IBM Mainframes during this period.

Robert Morris released an internet worm in 1988, resulting in the first internet crisis. Early 90s saw the emergence of Virus Exchange (VX)BBS allowing programmers to share ideas and code.

== The 90s ==

Till this point the antivirus softwares mainly searched for the viral presence by using certain signatures or code traces which would be present in any infected file. 
But with the appearance of Polymorphic viruses this philosophy had to change. 
In 1991, the first polymorphic virus Tequila was released.

In 1992 Michaelangelo gained a lot of publicity from the Media. Then came the MtE from Dark Avenger. This year also saw the appearance of Construction Kits for Viruses with pulldown menus and easy interface requiring very little programming experience to create a virus.

1995 brought with it a new concept in viral technology – Macro Viruses. Concept was the first macro virus and it infected Word Documents. This marks one of the earliest deviations from simple infection of the executables to infection of data files.

After the launch of Windows 95, the first true Win95 virus Boza appeared in 1996. 
This year also saw the Laroux, or a Excel Spreadsheet infector, and Staog, a Linux virus. 
A java virus, Strange Brew was observed in 1998, further extending the possibilities of victim files.

In 1999 Melissa was released causing worldwide chaos. Corner appeared, which infected Powerpoint presentations. Tristate also emerged which infected Documents, Spreadsheets, and Presentations.

== 2000 onwards ==

A major shift from viruses to worms could be seen in the latter years of the 90s. More and more worms started appearing. In 2000 Love Letter worm became the fastest spreading worm till date. It was also an interesting example of social engineering used for maximisation of spread. Streams, the proof of concept virus was the first to utilise the Alternate Data Stream of NTFS file system.

With the appearance of more and more languages and platforms, new ways of coding viruses evolved. Pirus for example was coded in PHP Scripting Language. It tries to infect HTML and php pages.Another example is Gnuman specifically attacking the gnutella p2p system. Winux, a proof of concept virus which could operate under both windows and Linux was released in 2001. Another example is the PeachyPDF-A, the first worm to utilise pdf files for its propagation.

Continuing with the trend as discussed above LFM-926, the first virus to shockwave Flash files(.swf) was released in 2002. In March 2002, Sharp-A the first .NET worm written in C# (apparently by a female hacker known as Gigabyte) was released. In late May, came Benjamin which attacked kazaa p2p system. Another interesting specimen was the Perrun virus which attached a portion of itself to JPEG image files.

2003 was another year of the worms. Some examples of worms which started spreading in this year were sobig (which had its own smtp engine), Slammer, Lovgate, Blaster etc. Social engineering techniques also developed quite a bit.

In February 2004 it was seen that virus writers were starting to use their craft for money. A German magazine managed to buy a list of infected IP addresses from a distributor of the virus Randex. These IP addresses were for sale to spammers who could use the infected machines as mail zombies. The end of April saw the Sasser worm which is the first to effectively use the LSASS Windows vulnerability; a vulnerability that allowed the worm to spread via an open FTP port instead of through E-mail.

The proof-of-concept Worm W64.Rugrat.3344 showed up the end of May. This is claimed to be the first malware that specifically attacks 64-bit Windows files only (it ignores 32-bit and 16-bit files). It was created using IA64 (Intel Architecture) assembly code.

In June Symb/Cabir-A which infects Nokia Series 60 mobile phones. It uses the bluetooth technology to spread to all bluetooth enabled devices in the vicinity. Early September saw W32/Amus-A show up. The only thing that qualified this beast to even be mentioned here was that it uses the Microsoft Speech engine in Windows to read out loud: &quot;hamsi. I am seeing you. Haaaaaaaa. You must come to turkiye. I am cleaning your computer. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. 0. Gule. Gule.&quot; 

On 14 September that paragon of virus-free file type, the JPEG image, came under attack. To be accurate, the image file itself is not so much to blame as a Microsoft common .DLL file that processes the image file type and has a buffer overrun error that could allow someone to add malicious code to a JPEG image which can then open holes in an attacked system. Shortly after, some Trojan exploits started to appear.

Santy worm appeared towards the end of 2004. It was written in Perl and used google to search for victims, which were phpBB forums and used certain vulnerabilities in phpBB code for spreading.

In 2005, at the end of January Bropia worm appeared which targets MSN Messenger for spreading. This is a sophisticated worm that spreads via E-mail and the MSN Messaging client. Its messages are very close to what a real user would send and, for the first time, attempts to spoof the return address as being from an anti-virus company (Trend or Symantec, and Microsoft, although coming from Microsoft has been a social engineering ploy for some time now).

Around 2006,
some mathematicians explore the possibility of a computer program that generates, not merely another copy of the same program, but a better program.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Instructional Design is the systematic approach to the development of instruction through Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. This ISD model is known as the [[Instructional Technology]]/[[Instructional Design]]/[[ADDIE]] model. Each phase in this model is done in a linear method. Rapid Prototyping is an alternate approach to the traditional instructional design. A prototype is an early phase of a system that has the same key feature components of the &quot;real&quot; thing.  In ID technology,allows greater flexibility in defining the goals and form of instruction at early stages.(Wilson &amp; Cole, 1993) Designers may opt to use Rapid Instructional Design (or Rapid Prototyping) when the following are factors: 
&lt;p&gt;• Time&lt;br&gt;
• Budget&lt;br&gt;
• Environmental restraints&lt;/p&gt;
When instructional designers are confronted with these demands, the use of rapid prototyping methodologies &quot;should reduce production time because: (a)using working models of the final product early in a project tends to eliminate time-consuming revisions later on, and (b)design tasks are completed concurrently, rather than sequentially throughout the project.&quot; (Jones and Richey, 2000)
With RP, the steps are crunched together to reduce the amount of time needed to develop training or a product. The design and development phases are done simultaneously and the formative evaluation is done throughout the process. &lt;br&gt;

----
Rapid prototyping can be used in situations to: test out a user interface, test the database structure and flow of information in a training system, test the effectiveness and appeal of a particular instructional strategy, develop a model case or practice exercise that can serve as a template, give clients and sponsors a more concrete model of the intended instructional product, and to get user feedback and reactons to two competing approaches. (Wilson, Jonassen, &amp; Cole, 1993)&lt;br&gt;

== Techniques for Rapid [[Instructional Technology/Instructional Design|Instructional Design]] ==

George M. Piskurich(2000) lists the following rapid design techniques for instructional development in each phase of the ADDIE model:&lt;br&gt;
'''A-ANALYZE'''&lt;br&gt;

1. Use retro assessment-ask the &quot;right questions&quot; to fill in the background on the program you are creating &lt;br&gt;
2. Interview the top 10 people most and first for an organizational assessment&lt;br&gt;
3. Perform a quick approach to a performance gap by&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the problem&lt;br&gt;
*Analyze the tasks and conditions of the job&lt;br&gt;
*Analyze the current performance level&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the causes of the problem&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the desired performance outcome&lt;br&gt;
*Identify the expectations of your training related to the outcome&lt;br&gt;
4.Forego time-intensive interviews and focus groups of a training needs assessment&lt;br&gt;
5.Use electronic bulletins instead of live meetings to collect data&lt;br&gt;
6.Interview two at a time or use net-based surveys to gather information&lt;br&gt;
7.Choose individuals who are not over-experienced to do a job analysis so that the information is not too complicated or use job descriptors that are well-detailed for job analysis&lt;br&gt;
8. Spend a day observing a Subject Matter Expert (SME) at work and ask questions for task analysis&lt;br&gt;
9. Videotape experts doing their jobs and analyze it for the component points&lt;br&gt;

'''D-DESIGN'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Use job analysis and distribute completed objectives and distribute&lt;br&gt;
2. Keep formal reporting to a minimum-jot down what you need to know&lt;br&gt;
3. Create a series of tests at various levels and distribute them to the trainees along with the objectives they are based on&lt;br&gt;
4. Use logical sequencing of steps&lt;br&gt;

'''D-Development'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Use existing polices, procedures, annual reports, magazine articles, pamphlets, etc. for training material&lt;br&gt;
2. Use games that let you alternate the content for instructional use or use templates&lt;br&gt;
3. Strip training of &quot;nice to know&quot; to &quot;must know&quot;&lt;br&gt;
4. Short cut video production by taping short video clips of SMEs doing their work and describing the process&lt;br&gt; or tape a SME as he/she does the training process&lt;br&gt;

'''I-Implementation'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Have reviewers or validators of the design meet as a group&lt;br&gt;
2. Allow the trainers train the trainers&lt;br&gt;

'''E-Evaluation'''&lt;br&gt;
1. Evaluate only what you need to evaluate&lt;br&gt;
2. Use performance checklists as a transfer evaluation to re-check performance&lt;br&gt;

With Rapid Prototyping the ADDIE model is not used as designed. It typically has several steps merged together to streamline the process. Rapid Prototyping should not be used by a novice, because even though it cuts out steps of ADDIE, the designer still must have knowledge of the whole process.

'''Representation of the Rapid Prototyping model''':[[File:Rapid Prototyping Model.gif]]

== Advantages of Rapid Prototyping ==
There are many advantages to using RP in instructional design. It allows for better communication between the designer and users because the needs are clearly expressed from the beginning. The user is able to offer immediate feedback which results in a better product. Its non-linear approach allows for more flexibility in the instruction and can catch problems early in the development stages. 
Moreover, RP reduces development time and costs.&lt;br&gt;

== Disadvantages of Rapid Prototyping ==

Some people believe that rapid prototyping is not an effective model of instructional design because it does not replicate the real thing. They believe that many important steps of instructional design are forfeited for a faster, cheaper model. Many problems may be overlooked and result in endless revision. The developments in this field like the poly jet printing, printing actual metal and functional parts. The disadvantages of Rapid Prototyping is gradually reducing.

{{Wikipedia|Varroa destructor}}
Also known as the Vampire Mite, Varroa Mite, Varroa Destructor and often mislabeled as Varroa Jacobsoni.

The Varroa Mite is a parasitic mite that can cause serious trouble to beekeepers and their bees alike. This tick-like mite, around the sized of a pinhead, does its damage by feeding on the bee’s hemolymph fluid (akin to bee blood). Mites attach themselves to foraging workers in order to spread themselves from one hive to another. This mite can severally weaken a hive through vampire-like action and through the spread of disease and bacteria. An unchecked mite population will almost certainly lead to the premature death of a honeybee colony. 

Within the United States, Varroa Mites have the largest impact when compared to other pests within the beekeeping industry. The Varroa Mite is also nearly completely responsible for the decimation and loss of feral honeybee colonies. Some beekeepers have resorted to reverting to small cell beekeeping and many hobbyist are moving towards [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hives]] in an effort to fight against this aggressive foe. Others are attempting to use mite resistant [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| races]] of bee with some success.

==Origin==
The Varroa mite was discovered in Southeast Asia in 1904, but now unfortunately spread mostly worldwide. More recently Varroa was discovered in 1987 within the US, 2000 in the North Island of New Zealand, 2007 in the South Island of New Zealand and to date, Australia is the only country free of this pest.

==Anatomy==
Varroa is approximately 1.00 to 1.77 mm in length and 1.50 to 1.99 mm. Its body closely resembles that of a tick, it has eight legs and the apparatus to pierce the epidermal layer of both adult and larval bees in order to feed. The mite is red-brown in color and wide and plainly visible to the naked eye when on brood, and can be more difficulty spotted, on some occasions, on the adult bee.

==Life Cycle==
[[Image:Vorroa Mite on pupa.JPG|thumb|right|Varroa Mite on Pupa]]
Within a hive mites can reproduce on a 10-day cycle. The female mite, after detaching from an adult bee, will enter the cell of an uncapped brood. The mite shows preference for the drone brood, but will select what is available. Once the cell is sealed, the female will begin to lay eggs and then expire. As the young bee develops, so will the mites. As soon as the new bee is able to leave its berthing cell, the mites attach themselves and start the cycle anew. The life cycle of the Varroa mite is dependant on the existence of brood within a colony. 

==Symptoms==
; Possible signs that a mite infection is underway may include, but is not limited, to the following
:*Mites obvious on brood, emerging bees, or foragers
:*Deformed bees
:*Discarded larva
;*Spotty brood pattern
:*Apparently sudden death of colony
:*Dead mites found near the entrance of the hive

==Detection==
If Varroa infestation is suspected, there is often nothing major lost by examining. However, a colony may be doomed if left unchecked. Checking for Varroa should be part of a beekeeper's regular regime. The following methods are some common ways to detect a possible mite infestation.
===Ether Roll===
The ether roll test is the grandfather of the [[#Sugar Roll| sugar roll test]], though effective it is not always the best method, as tested bees will die as a result.
#Using a wide mouthed jar, such as a mason or pickle jar, collect a sample of bees (not the queen) and fill the jar about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; full.
#Using ether, such as that from a can of carburetor starter fluid, apply a small amount to the bees (approximately a tablespoon worth). The inside of jar should be slightly moist with all bees at the bottom.
#Place the lid on the jar and roll bees for about 20-30 seconds.
#If done quickly, the jar may be opened and some of the bees may escape alive, though this is doubtful and the ones that do survive will be ready to sting.
#Examine the sides and bottom of the ether filled jar. If you count one or more mites, it is advised that you begin some sort of treatment. If you count around a dozen mites, it means you have a significant infestation, and should immediately begin treatment. If you find more mites than you can easily count, your hive is in serious trouble
#Dump remaining dead bees and clean the jar before next use.

;Notes
:#If you can do the either roll, there is little reason not to do the [[#Sugar Roll| sugar roll]] instead, as it is not lethal to the bees and is takes no more time.
;#Soapy water or 70 percent isopropyl (rubbing alcohol) can be used with varying success instead of ether.

===Drone Culling===
Unfortunately, the drone culling method kills drones to determine if there is a mite infestation. Despite this fact, culling drones is a quick and reliable method to check levels.
#Select a frame (or comb) with a large patch of capped drone brood. Gently remove adult bees from the frame and locate it to an easy to work area.
#Using a capping scratcher to remove the cappings from the selected brood cells. The drone brood within unfortunately must be impaled during this step.
#Mites will be plainly visible on the pupae as they are removed from their cells. Two to three mites on single pupae indicate a serious problem. Two to three mites per 50 pupae indicate a low to moderate infestation.
#Remove the culled brood, especially if heavily infected, or allow the bees to clean up after returning the frame to its original hive.

;Notes
:* Caped drone brood can be differentiate from capped worker brood as it has larger cells with slightly domed shaped capping. 
:* When returning the frame be sure to return it to its original hive, unless you are absolutely sure it does not carry any disease or mites.
:* The [[#Sugar Roll| sugar roll]] method for detection is a little more time consuming, but no bees must die for it to succeed.

===Sugar Roll===
The sugar roll method, also called the sugar shake method, is a technique that can be used to fairly reliably determine if bees have a Varroa infestation. In contrast to the ether roll and drone culling, when done properly there is no harm done to the bees in the sample.
#Using a wide mouthed jar such as a mason or pickle jar, cut a large hole in the lid and affix a rigid mesh from which bees can’t escape. Size 8 hardware cloth serves this purpose well. 
#With the jar open, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar to the bottom of the jar.
#Scoop the jar about one cup of bees (or 100 to 200 bees), being sure that you have not captured the queen. Quickly seal the jar with the lid you made.
#Covering the lid so as not to loose the sugar, give the jar several vigorous shakes, the more the better (to a point). This will surely aggravate the bees, but should not cause them any serious harm.
#Shake the sugar (and mites) out of the jar onto a piece of white paper or something with a similar white background. Set the jar of bees aside in the shade to calm down.
#If you count one or more mites, it is advised that you begin some sort of treatment. If you count around a dozen mites, it means you have a significant infestation, and should immediately begin treatment. If you find more mites than you can easily count, your hive is in serious trouble.
#Allow your recently jarred and jarred bees ten to fifteen minutes rest before returning them to the hive. This is mainly for the sake of the beekeeper, as the shaken bees may be ready to sting. Although some of your bees are now covered in sugar and appear to bee little ghosts, don’t worry. Their sisters are more than up to enjoying the task of cleaning the sugar off of them.

;Notes
:*Some keepers choose to use a modified sugar roll technique on entire packages of bees, but be sure not to do so to the queen, to avoid risk of injury. This technique is most useful when there is no brood, so it may similarly be stretched to include recently captured swarms. When brood is present, the treatment must be repeated several times at ten day intervals.
;*Although it is not often recommended to use powdered sugar in conjunction with bees due to anti caking agents that may be present, it should not be a problem with this technique to the little exposure actually obtained.

===Screened Bottom Board===
Simply installing a screened bottom board allows you to keep mite levels in check with out having to actively monitor.

;Notes
:* It is advisable to apply a sticky board, tacky adhesive, or a thin layer of Vaseline to the catch tray of the bottom board, so that live mites cannot return to the hive.
;* As with any passive technique, results are not instantaneous and therefore the results may not be dependable or the results may arrive at too late to be useful.

===Observation of Bees===
If you are easily able to observe mites on foraging bees, the colony is in trouble. Begin to remedy the situation as soon as possible.

==Methods of Control==
There exist many methods of controlling levels of Varroa mites, each with varying success. Unfortunately most methods are for control only, there may always be a level of mites once a colony has been infected. Only extremely drastic measure, such as culling the hive, can assure a zero mite population. 

Any controls using any sort of chemical device should not be used for up to 30 days prior to a honey flow that will be used for collection of honey for human consumption, unless otherwise noted. 

===Chemical Treatments===
====Apistan====
Apistan is a readily available plastic strip that is treated with a form of miticide. Users should follow the instructions present on the packaging. 
;Notes
:*Understand the instructions fully before applying
:*Do not apply when honey supers on the hive
:*Most commonly, 1 strip per 5 frames should be used, do not over medicate
:*Do not use strips for longer than the time stated on the packaging, this will and has caused mite resistance to the poison.
:*Wear protective gloves when applying and removing strips
:*Once used, do not reuse strips
:*Treatment timing is extremely important for success, do not use more than once in the fall and once in the spring.
:*Do not use in conjunction with [[#CheckMite+| CheckMite+]]

====CheckMite+====
CheckMite+ is similar to the product Apistan in the fact that it is miticide on a plastic strip. CheckMite+ however uses a different miticide that that which is present on Apistan strips. CheckMite+ should only be used if you Varroa mite infestation has proven to be resistant to Apistan. Users should follow the instructions present on the packaging. 
;Notes
:*Understand the instructions fully before applying
;* CheckMite+ should only be used if you Varroa mite infestation has proven to be resistant to Apistan
:*Do not apply when honey supers on the hive
:*Most commonly, 1 strip per 5 frames should be used, do not over medicate
:*Do not use strips for longer than the time stated on the packaging, this will and has caused mite resistance to the poison.
:*Wear protective gloves when applying and removing strips
:*Once used, do not reuse strips
:*Treatment timing is extremely important for success, do not use more than once in the fall and once in the spring.
:*Do not use in conjunction with Apistan

===Dusting===
A dusting of powdered sugar or wheat flour in conjunction with a [[Beekeeping/Screened Bottom Board| screened bottom board]] or a sticky board can cause mites to fall and be captured. Though this method can be used during honey collection, it should only be used as a last ditch effort. This must be repeated once a week for two to three weeks to make any kind of lasting effect.

;Notes
:*Only dust the adult bees, as open brood may perish due to dusting.  However it may be said that Dr Fakhimzadeh of Helsinki university has suggested that sugar DOES NOT has a negative effect on open brood and egg damage only seems to occur when dusting with sugar and Oxy-Tertra-Cycline (OTC) indicating that it is the OTC that is doing the damage.  Nevertheless Jim Fischer of WSBA points out that we should avoid open cells ready for laying as the queen will only lay in clean cells
;*This process must be repeated as it will not affect mites that are sealed in cells with brood or affect mites that are piggybacking on absent foragers

===Drone Culling===
Similar to the method of detection of the same name, drone culling can be used to reduce the number of mites infesting a hive. This process can be done as hone supers are on the hive.
#When starting a colony, use a sheet of drone brood foundation, per hive body. 
#Occasionally when the brood comb is full simply cull the drones by placing the entire frame in the freezer. 
#Once frozen comb has defrosted replace it in the hive to allow the bees to clean it and refill the comb.
#Repeat as necessary.

;Notes
:* If drone foundation is not available, take about an inch tall piece of normal foundation and simply used this as a starter strip by installing it on the top of a frame. This method allows the bees to create their own comb, though it may not always be successful in creating drone comb.
:*Instead of freezing, uncapped drone brood can be hung in order to feed local birds, but do not replace the frame in this instance as it will be more than likely destroyed by the appreciative birds.
:*Instead of freezing drone can be culled by heating, though this often readily becomes a waxy mess is not kept under control.

===Breaking Brood Cycle===
The act of breaking the brood cycle, by culling the queen, and allowing the bees to raise their own queen will prevent Varroa mites from laying eggs and thereby end their life cycle.

;Notes
:*Instead of culling a healthy and productive queen, she can be used to requeen a separate hive or begin a Nuc.
:*Instead of using a self produced queen, you can replace with a store bought queen, but you must allow for a natural broodless cycle
:*This method could be used during a honey flow, but a lack of new workers will cause it to be poor honey season.

===Grease Patties===
Using [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#Grease Patties| grease patties]] with or with out [[Beekeeping/Guide to Essential Oils| essential oil]] will cause a decrease in  tracheal mites. They are sometimes used as a varroa mite control method.
Though it is preferred to use patties with essential oils, it should not be done during a honey flow. To be effective, grease patties must remain on the hive year round.

===Essential Oil Treatment===
Using essential oil in a [[Beekeeping/Recipes for the Bees#Sugar Syrup| sugar syrup feed]] as been show to reduce mite levels. Syrup feed should not be supplied when honey supers are on the hive.

===Tobacco Smoke===
A heavy tobacco smoking in conjunction with a [[Beekeeping/Screened Bottom Board| screened bottom board]] or a sticky board can cause mites to fall and be captured. Though this method can be used during honey collection, it should only be used as a last ditch effort. This must be repeated once a week for two to three weeks to make any kind of lasting effect.

;Notes
:*When smoking, be sure that the smoke is not too hot, use cool smoke only
;*This process must be repeated as it will not affect mites that are sealed in cells with brood or affect mites that are piggybacking on absent foragers

===Formic Acid===
Formic acid is very caustic, and toxic to both bees and humans if not used properly. The liquid form of formic acid is somewhat dangerous to use, but is safe if handled carefully. Wearing gloves is essential.  Beekeeper supply houses may sell a time-release gel form that is easier to use and less toxic. 

;notes
:*Follow directions before using
:*Take caution in use as it is toxic to bees and beekeeper alike
:*When used, formic acid will also treat tracheal mites

===Food Grade Mineral Oil===
Some beekeepers use an electric or propane insect fogger to apply a mist of food grade mineral oil to their bees.  This has been shown to induce a grooming behavior in the bees which can reduce mite levels when combined with a screened bottom board.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think this should be cleaned up a bit.

Yes, that is true, the user Jclee has allready done a great job in correcting my terrible grammar.[[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]]

--

Not an official user, but I have a few areas that you can draw inspiration from, or use as a reference:[http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/DI/Chapter9.pdf Democratizing Innovation], [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ The Cathedral and the Bazaar] (Along with ESR's other OSS writings), and [http://www.demos.co.uk/proamrevolutionfinal_pdf_media_public.aspx The Pro-Am Movement]. 

It may be a good idea to add historic content and context to the book as well. That would require delving into things such as the foundation of the FSF and Wikimedia. Court battles should be included within this section, such as Eldred vs. Ashcroft. And the major players would need to be covered: Eric Raymond, Richard Stallman, Larry Lessig, The founders of Wikimedia &amp; Creative Commons (I am too much an OSS guy to know), etc, etc.

Another good source of content may be internet radio stations that are run completely by volunteers. Some include &quot;shows&quot;. Those that I have seen usually spring up around MMORPGs, but they are open collaborative efforts nonetheless. Examples include [http://www.eve-radio.com Eve Radio] and [http://www.radiofreezion.com/ Radio Free Zion].

great ideas, I'll go over them a bit more in detail a bit later, for the moment I am really busy here at university. why don't you become a registered user and contribute a bit ? but thank you very much for your comments [[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]] 18:29, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

== Greetings ==

Hi there! This looks like a worthy project; I hope I get a chance to help out. I've passed word about this around to a few others; maybe they'll contribute too. Wanted to throw out a few ideas for sources:

* Lessig's [http://free-culture.cc/ Free Culture] is first in the canon -- probably other of his works, too
* Blogs: Once this project has a bit of a framework, maybe it could get some blog exposure to draw in new contributors? Additionally, blogs could be considered part of the ''source material'' of this book: they are sort of the &quot;newspapers&quot; of this subject.
* There are at least a few academics worldwide who either work in or study / have studied this subject. Soliciting their expertise could be an important way to get useful criticisms / contributions / editing. -- [[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 09:50, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

1) you're right about Lessig, I have to read the document through, havn't yet had the time, hope to do so this summer. 2) you're right, blogs are definitely part of the open culture movement, great idea. 3) Do you think that one could allready contact them ? people like Mr. Lessig would probably only accept to help if there is allready more content ? Thank's for your help. [[User:Bobbyandck|Bobbyandck]] 11:02, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

== Living, etc v ==

If there's a Work section (todo: collaborative and cooperative models of working? links with political theory and practice?), should there not also be a Living (or such) section for things like open architecture and sharing resources on social platforms? I'll try work on something soon.. --[[User:Milk|Milk]] ([[User talk:Milk|talk]]) 23:37, 19 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

===A note on pronunciation===
Danish words are rather difficult for English-speakers to pronounce correctly when given only the written form. Even after hearing the words being spoken, the sounds can be frustrating to reproduce. The [[Danish/Alfabet|pronunciation guide]] is an attempt to explain how the words should be spoken, but these rules are quite hard to follow when confronted with a word like ''Smørrebrødsjomfru'' (refers to a woman making something called &quot;Smørrebrød&quot;, which is a slice of dark bread with butter and a lot of fillings on top, like salad, fish, &quot;remoulade&quot; etc.).

Here's a very incomplete list of tips for the simple greetings in this lesson:

*'''Hej''' (&quot;''Hi''&quot;) = almost like the English ''Hi''. Sound sample [[Media:Hej.ogg]]
*'''Dav''' = say ''Dau''. Sound sample [[Media:Dav.ogg]]
*'''Goddag''' (&quot;''Goodday''&quot;) = the last ''g'' is silent. Sound sample [[Media:Goddag.ogg]]
*'''Godmorgen''' (&quot;''Goodmorning''&quot;) = &quot;''go-moarn''&quot;. The ''r'' is pronounced in the back of the throat, nearly silent. Sound sample [[Media:Godmorgen.ogg]]

==Hellos and Goodbyes in Danish==
Hellos:
 Hello!        ''Hej!''
               ''Hejsa!''
               ''Dav!''
               ''Goddag!''
 Good morning! ''Godmorgen!''
 Good evening! ''Godaften!''

Goodbyes:
 Goodbye/Farewell      ''Farvel!''
 Bye!          ''Hej hej!''
 Later!        ''Vi ses!''
 Good night!   ''Godnat!''

==Samtale 1 ~ Conversation 1==

Sofie and Louise are friends. They meet and talk about their day.

''Louise:'' Hej Sofie, hvordan går det?&lt;br&gt;
''Sofie:'' Det går godt, tak. Hvad med dig?&lt;br&gt;
''Louise:'' Jeg har det fint.&lt;br&gt;
''Sofie:'' Hvad så?&lt;br&gt;
''Louise:'' Ikke noget særligt&lt;br&gt;
''Sofie:'' Hej hej, Louise.&lt;br&gt;
''Louise:'' Vi ses.&lt;br&gt;

|}

You can probably figure out the rest, with the help of the ''Hellos and Goodbyes'' table.

==Samtale 2==

Take a look at this short formal conversation to see how Danes address each other formally.

''Hr. Nilsen:'' Goddag! Hvordan har De det?&lt;br&gt;
''Hr. Klaaborg:'' Goddag! Jeg har det fint, tak.&lt;br&gt;
''Hr. Nilsen:'' Godt, Farvel!&lt;br&gt;
''Hr. Klaaborg:'' Farvel!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

| =
| Mister (mr.)
|-
| Frk., Frøken
| =
| Ms., Miss
|-
| Fr., Fru
| =
| Mrs., Missis
|}
|}

You may have noticed that hr. Nilsen referred to hr. Klaaborg as ''De''. This is the polite form for ''you'', as opposed to the casual ''du'', which Sofie and Louise used. This is rarely used in Danish today though, but can still be seen when people demand great respect, like, for example, the nobility.

==Immediate family==
====Forældre ~ Parents====
Just like in English, the Danish language has several words for ''mother'' and ''father''. Starting with the words for ''mother'', we see:
*'''Mor'''
And sometimes:
*'''Moder'''
The most common word for ''father'' is:
*'''Far'''
But occasionally
*'''Fader'''
is used.

====Søskende ~ Siblings====
The words for ''søskende'' (siblings) are for ''brother'':
*'''Bror'''
*'''Broder'''
and for ''sister'':
*'''Søster'''

====Børn ~ Children====
In Danish, the words for ''son'' and ''daughter'' are close to English. They are '''søn''' and '''datter''', respectively.

==The rest of the family==

*'''Onkel''' = Uncle, used mostly for a man married to a moster or faster
*'''Morbror''' = Mother's brother
*'''Farbror''' = Father's brother

*'''Tante''' = Aunt, used mostly about a woman married to a farbror or morbror
*'''Moster''' = Mother's sister 
*'''Faster''' = Father's sister

*'''Niece''' = Niece
*'''Nevø''' = Nephew

*'''Fætter''' = Male cousin
*'''Kusine''' = Female cousin

====Bedsteforældre ~ Grandparents====
Grandparents are also quite simple. Keep in mind ''mor'' is mother and ''far'' is father.

Maternal Grandparents:
*'''Mormor''' = Maternal grandmother
*'''Morfar''' = Maternal grandfather

Paternal Grandparents:
*'''Farmor''' = Paternal grandmother
*'''Farfar''' = Paternal grandfather

The Danish word for ''grandchild'' is '''barnebarn'''.

====Oldeforældre ~ Great-grandparents====
*'''Oldefar'''/'''Oldefader''' = Great-grandfather
*'''Oldemor'''/'''Oldemoder''' = Great-grandmother
The Danish word for ''great-grandchild'' is '''oldebarn'''

====Tipoldeforældre ~ Great-great-grandparents====
*'''Tipoldefar'''/'''Tipoldefader''' = Great-great-grandfather
*'''Tipoldemor'''/'''Tipoldemoder''' = Great-great-grandmother
The Danish word for ''great-great-grandchild'' is '''tipoldebarn'''.
* For every generation from this point forward you add another '''tip-''' to the title.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anyone have an outline for how this book should be organized? --[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 13:37, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Game Theory Handbook outline ==

Rough ideas on what should be here:

#Introduction
#What is a game? Definitions and classifications
#Non-cooperative games
#Bargaining theory
#Cooperative games
#Games in continuous state-spaces and differential games
#Auctions
#Mechanism design
#Appendix: theorems and proofs

Hey Chuck and whoever suggested the outline, I've been waiting here for a while for someone to get working on this book but it doesn't seem to be happening. If I get any spare time I'll try and add some stuff, but I think its probably pointless discussing stuff on the talk page now because no-one seems to be interested in this book anymore due to a lack of interest in writing it.

== Stuff moved from duplicate book [[Game theory]] ==

We will first look at the game theory by von Neumann and Morgenstein and then later study multiplayer games, nonzero sum games, games with chance, and finally, combinatorial game theory. - [[User:128.175.112.225|128.175.112.225]]

----

Is it on topic to include items on Combinatorial Game Theory, studying games such as Nim and such like? - [[User:Paul|Paul]]

----

The book should probably have some extensive information on evolutionary game theory.  Much has been written by Maynard Smith and others.  It seems EGT will be a big part of the future of GT. - [[User:67.162.52.102|67.162.52.102]]

== Edit war ==

We seem to have an edit war going on. I was going to use '/' rather than ':' as per [[WB:NP]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:50, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Dear god, I'm so sorry mate, having never been in something even near an edit war before (i seem to work on projects no-one else touches) I was a bit confused. Sorry. I think everything's sorted out now as per [[WB:NP]]...at least I hope so. Once again, sorry Aya...[[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

:Nah. My fault. I'm on the RC IRC server at irc://irc.wikimedia.org/#en.wikibooks so I can see every edit pop up as it happens. I shouldn't assume you see the same thing. :-) - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:07, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

== Ideas ==

There's loads of content from Wikipedia we could use here. Much of the stuff on [[w:Prisoner's dilemma]] seems too in-depth, so we could shift it to here. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:54, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, OK, Ii'll see what I can do. Thanks again. - [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, just had a look at [[w:Prisoner's dilemma]] and apparently it's a feature article over in Wikipedia, so the guys over there think its an excellent article and probably like the &quot;in-depth&quot; nature of it, even though I have to agree with Aya, it probably should be on Wikibooks. I might use it as a basis and expand from it. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:59, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

: Don't be afraid to fork the content. This is now allowed as per [[Wikibooks:About]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:08, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

In this section we attempt to teach you numbers and colors in Danish.

==Tal ~ Numbers==
The Danish number system can be confusing. Instead of saying ''twenty-one'', in Danish the equivalent is literally ''one-and-twenty''. This rule goes all the way up to the nineties. It can seem illogical at times, especially when reciting phone numbers. The hundreds, thousands, millions and so on are put in the same order as in English. If you want to say ''four thousand two hundred twenty-four'' it's ''fire tusinde to hundrede og fireogtyve'' which literally is ''four thousands two hundreds fourandtwenty''. Notice that there aren't any spaces in numbers below 100 when written in words in Danish, but numbers higher than 100 are split up in several words. Also notice that thousands are mentioned in plural because there's more than one (fire tusind'''e'''-).

This tutorial assumes that you have completed all previous tutorials.


==Method 1 ==
===Get the pictures of the model===
{{Tip|The images here do not line up. Some need to be rotated and others do not match in size. They will be kept so that you can get the &quot;real feel&quot; for this project.}}

If you have a puppy and a digital camera, take three pictures of the cute little rascal and upload them.  If you don't have a puppy, any object or small animal will do.  Ideally, the photos will be looking straight down at the top of the puppy, a side view, and a front view. It's important that the puppy be in the same pose in all three photos!  Or at least close to the same pose...we all know puppies don't stand still very long.

You could use two mirrors. One is placed next to the puppy at 45 degrees to the camera and 45 degrees to the puppy. Another is placed above the puppy, also at 45 degrees to the camera and 45 degrees to the puppy. This produces three images, one of the puppy ('''front \ NUM1'''), one of its reflection seen 90 degrees to the right ('''side \ right \ NUM3)'''), and one of its reflection seen from overhead ('''top \ NUM7''').  Take the photo from a long distance away with a zoom lens to get close to an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic orthographic projection].

Or how about pictures of a toy wolf taken from 6 view points?:

*[http://img119.imageshack.us/my.php?image=10011375bc.jpg Top view]

Using your favorite image editor, such as PhotoShop or the [[GIMP]] (see detailed GIMP instructions below: [[#Detailed steps to align images using GIMP|Detailed steps to align images using GIMP]]), down-scale the images need to a reasonable size (I made mine 512x384), and then match them to each other.  To match them, draw construction lines (pulled from the rulers above and to the left) on the left view for example to pick out key features.  I picked the tail, the front of the back foot, eye level, tip of the ear, and the front of the nose:

[[Image:Toywolf-construction-left.jpg]]

I found when I picked out these features that this first image needed to be rotated slightly.   That completed, I proceeded to scale, rotate and shift the other two views (top and front) until they matched fairly well as layers on top:

[[Image:Toywolf-construction-top.jpg]]
[[Image:Toywolf-construction-front.jpg]]

Once I had the proper results I saved the resulting images, and these are the ones we will use in Blender.

The results are the files you'll need for Step Two:

[[Image:Toywolf-left.jpg]]
[[Image:Toywolf-front.jpg]]
[[Image:Toywolf-top.jpg]]

Just right-click and save them some place where you can find them to load them into Blender for Step Two. You may notice the photos aren't perfect, but we'll use them just to show how you should deal with your real photos.  When you are creating your own pictures to import, note [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax parallax].  In this example, parallax is present, and we'll attempt to compensate.

===Get the Picture into Blender===
Getting the image into blender is the easy part. The more difficult part will be creating the mesh, but first things first. Create a new file (''File → New'') to see the familiar default objects. Don't bother deleting the cube, we'll end up using it in the tutorial. Just as was done in the [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Aligning_Vertices_with_a_Guide_Image#Using_the_guide_images|&quot;Making A Pyramid&quot;]] section, split the 3D Viewer into four views with CTRL-ALT-Q.

Each window will show you different XYZ coordinates.

Go to View &gt; Properties, or press {{B3D:N2P/Do|NKEY}}.  A new toolbar will open to the right of the viewport and by scrolling through you should see ''Background Images''.   Use the &quot;Add images&quot; bar and options will open up.  Then check the box to display your images. 


Click the ''Add Image'' button and several more buttons will appear. Now &quot;Open&quot; button.  A new full-viewport window will appear.  Explore this window a bit and end up selecting the image file of the wolf from the top view. What you should get is the picture of the toy wolf from above with the default cube on top of it. 

Now load the top view of the wolf, click on &quot;Open&quot; select the picture and set &quot;Axis:&quot; to &quot;Front&quot;. Repeat the procedure and load the picture of the wolf to the other views.

'''Noob note:''' the photo from the top goes into top view, the photo from the front goes into the right view, and the photo from the right goes into front view, if you have front in front, change it now!

The pictures are now loaded into the Blender viewports.  If you look at the pictures on the grid, you may notice that the front view of the wolf isn't quite center.  That is okay, Blender has a way to fix it.

Press '''Shift + SpaceBar''', this expands the current viewport to a fullscreen view, then go to &quot;Background Images&quot; and go to the Front view.  Notice that there are picture manipulation options available.  One of these includes picture offsets. Click on right side of the 'X Offset: 0.00' to increase the offset to 0.20.  The picture will be shifted over slightly so now the wolf is more centered. Press '''Shift + SpaceBar''' again to return to the window-setup you had earlier.
Correct the other views also, and scale the cube if needed.

'''Noob Note:''' If you made, and aligned your own photos, you will need to use a different value than '0.20' to center the head in the cube in front view.

The setup work is now done!  Let's start on actually making the wolf model.

[[Image:Wolftut1.png]]

===Create a Rough Model===
This is a brute force model creation using techniques discussed previously in this book.  This section is meant to help you explore and become more comfortable with them.  Do ''not'' try to follow the example to the tee.  Your wolf and my wolf will probably not look the same since you may want to add more or have less detail.

'''Noob Note:''' If you are just getting started with blender, this step  may likely take several hours to complete, since you must use your own creativity to position things in 3D space, using 2D views. Just like sculpting, drawing, or oil painting, it will be extremely fustrating at first, but once you get used to the way it works, &quot;modeling&quot; will be much easier.


The rough fit stage requires either some planning or on-the-spot decisions.  Think about where the wolf will have parts of its body flex or require parts jutting out.


The first step is to create a blocky wolf.  Start out with a column of blocks using the extrude face command (select face, '''EKEY''').  Don't worry about snapping the vertices to the grid since we are working with an organic figure.

'''''Noob Note:''' It is handy to do this in wireframe view, to see better how the rough model fits out''

'''Figure 2.3.1''' Body column formation&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut2.png]]


The next step is to split the ears and legs off of the body.  Do this by subdividing (With &quot;Quad/Tri Mode&quot; checked) the appropriate faces.  Save often, and if you make a mistake, go ahead and use the undo option ('''CTRL''' '''ZKEY''').  Also, if you find yourself looking at redundant faces, combine them ('''FKEY''').

'''Figure 2.3.2''' Appendage formation&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut3.png]]]

If you are having trouble with this, try mousing over the perspective window (the one you designated with NUM0) and using the MMB to rotate the view so that you are looking at the underside of the wolf. Click on the face underneath the wolf that is alongside his front legs (use the side view to check this). We are going to subdivide this face in order to grow legs off the new faces. To subdivide, press the WKEY and choose subdivide. You will see that the face has been divided into four. Take one of these faces and extrude it as many times as is necessary to make the right leg. Then do the same again for his left leg.

'''Noob Note:''' To avoid making the extruded faces share common vertices (and be connected to each other), either extrude the legs separately (as stated above) or select ''Individual faces'' in the Extrude pop-up menu. The same works for the ears.

Doing the ears is similar, except instead of working underneath you will start with the face on top of the wolf which is directly over the ears. Select this face and subdivide it once. Deselect everything using AKEY, then select one of these four faces and extrude it upwards once to make an ear. Do the same for the face alongside it to make the other ear.

Finally, extrude the tail end of the wolf one more time, so that your wolf has as many divisions as the picture above.

===Refine the rough model===
Let's start refining the model starting with the tail. Try putting your viewports in wireframe mode by pushing Z, it may make things much easier.  Line up the vertices over the wolf in each viewport by lasso selecting multiple vertices ('''CTRL LMB, Drag'''). then move to the right location with grab ('''GKEY''').

'''Figure 2.3.3''' Working on the tail&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut4.png]]


Continue onto the hind legs of the wolf.  It is trickier to manipulate the legs so keep rotating a viewport to look at the model from multiple perspectives.  Remember that we are working in three dimensions.

'''Figure 2.3.4''' Working on the hind legs&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut5.png]]


Continue working up along the wolf fitting the blocks to the pictures.  If you have problems seeing the picture because the model is in the way, let's hide the model.  In Edit Mode, select the entire model by '''AKEY''' or by pressing '''LKEY''' when you have the cursor over the model.  Simply pressing '''HKEY''' will hide the selected items.  To unhide the view, use '''ALT+HKEY'''.  By hiding and unhiding the model, or parts of the model, you should be able to keep using the picture as a guide.
''Note: It is much easier to just switch layers by, let's say, pressing '''2KEY''' (not the Num-Block one) to hide the entire model (thus getting a look at the picture) and '''1KEY''' to reveal the mesh again.''


Once you have the first pass done, you'll notice that the model just won't fit all three pictures correctly.  This is due to parallax.  The most obvious example is the side view.  The four feet should be level, as they are all standing on a flat surface.  Since they are not, we'll just ignore some of the aspects of each picture and continue with the model.  (This is a helpful example to show what you need to consider when taking your own pictures.)

'''Figure 2.3.5''' Completed rough fit&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut6.png]]

===Subsurf the model===

Now that the rough fit is done, let's smooth out the wolf.  Add a Subsurf modifier and set the Levels to 2.  The wolf will now be smoothed, but we want to add some of the hard lines back into the model.  This may be accomplished with creased edges.

Select Edges or faces you want to crease and press '''SHIFT + EKEY'''.  Use the mouse and pull away from the center until the Crease value is close to what you want.  A value of +1.000 will give you the sharpest look and is useful for places such as the bottoms of the paws.  When an edge has been creased, the edge will be highlighted in yellow (positive crease) or black (negative crease).  These highlights are shown due to the 'Draw Creases' button being turned on.

In this example, I creased edges along the paws, tail, ears, and nose to give them some sharpness.

'''Figure 2.4.1''' Creased edges&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut7.png]]


The last step is to refit the model to the pictures.  You may have noticed that when the model was smoothed, the result didn't quite fit to the pictures.  Now is a great time to tweak the vertices to fit to the pictures or add to/modify the model.

''Noob note: if you see a weird edge on the body after smoothing, check the face normals (F9 &gt; Mesh Tools More &gt; Draw Normals; and then W &gt; Flip Normals on the culprit faces).''

And here is my basic wolf based on three pictures!

'''Figure 2.4.2''' Final toy wolf model&lt;br&gt;[[Image:Wolftut8.png|400px]]



==Method 2 (using mirroring)==

In this alternative method we will do half a wolf and then mirror it to create a complete wolf. You should start out by creating a silhouette of the wolf body in the side view, and then in front view start to shape the wolf head, tail and legs...

'''Noob Note:''' If you are attempting this method, it is best to avoid using triangles in rounded areas of a Mesh, because they tend to cause artifacts in your model (artifacts are protruding edges or other things that don't look realistic). Using quads is a much better alternative. Triangles should only be used on flat areas of your mesh if they cannot be avoided.

[[Image:Wolf building front.jpg]]

Here is what you  should end up with
[[Image:Wolf finished.jpg|400px]]

== Using mirroring with method 1 ==

You can also use mirroring with the first method (the one with cube extrusions).

This can speed up your work as you don't have to do the same changes on each side of the fox - just once.

To start the mirroring:
* Go to Editing ('''F9''')
* In the ''Modifiers'' panel, add a ''Mirror''
* Check only the ''Y'' button

When modeling:
* You may want to adjust the ''Merge Limit'' value (e.g. 0.14): this means vertices too close to each others (after the mirroring) will be merged, thus avoiding artifacts along the mirror's axis.
* Remove the faces along the mirror's axis, otherwise Subsurf will be confused by the faces ''inside'' the body of the mirrored fox.  Keep all the faces for the legs though.
* To move the legs differently on each side: when you're done modeling the rest of the fox, apply the Mirror modifier, and then work on each leg independently.

==Detailed steps to align images using GIMP==

From this point forward there are multiple ways to do exactly the same thing, however for simplicity's sake and so that I can be more detailed I will be using one method (the one which I use) and be using GIMP.

I found it best to size all the photos to a known width, with an easy way to find center. (Mine happened to be 850x638 pixels, I don’t recommend that but you can choose any size you want really, as long as all of them are the same size). Then drag the construction lines to form a crosshair in the middle of the photo. To do this, click on the top ruler, and drag down to the middle (Exact middle) of the photo, then click on the side ruler and drag across to the middle (Again exact middle) of the photo. 

If you are having trouble finding the exact middle of the photo, move the cursor to the very bottom left of your photo and the height of your photo will be listed at the bottom left of the GIMP interface. The numbers are listed in an (x,y) format so you want the first number to say 0 and the second to be the largest you can make it by dragging your cursor. The second number is the height, and half of that is the middle of your photo. You can do the same with the top ruler to find the vertical middle of your photo. Only this time the co-ordinates at the bottom left of the GIMP interface should list the second number (y) as 0, and the first number should be as large as you can make it by moving your cursor (to the upper right of the photo).Once you have your width again half of that will be the middle of your photo.

Then using construction lines put one at the top of your object, and the bottom of your object. Find the &quot;height&quot; of your object by the distance between them. Remove the construction lines from the top and the bottom, and place a new construction line above the horizontal center line by the half of the &quot;height&quot;(of your object). Now place a construction line on both sides of your object and find the “width” (distance between the new vertical lines), then remove those construction lines and place a new construction line vertically half of the &quot;width&quot;(of your object) to the right of the vertical center line. Now cut the object out, and drag it so that the point you used as the &quot;top&quot; is on the horizontal construction line that is above the middle. Then Drag the photo left or right until the right edge of the object is on the vertical construction line you put in right of the middle construction line. 

Now the center of your object is at the center of your photo. This is a very important thing because when blender loads in the picture you will need this so that all of your pictures match up with each other 3d. You should repeat these steps with all 3 photos. I also don't recommend doing it in GIMP's &quot;layered mode&quot; as that caused more pandemonium for me. I recommend opening each photo in a new window .

Taking your pictures is the most important part, because if the pictures are not all in the same scale (object size to photo size) then your photos will not line up and you won't be able to place a dot on the same location from front view, side view, and top view. 

As a recommendation I would recommend making your first model from a Lego man. That is what I did and it is very simplistic easy practice. To take my photos I took about 10 minutes to construct a photo platform for my object. It consisted of a cardboard box with two sides cut out. I covered the inside area with computer paper. I then used a 2”x4” and a ruler to make sure that the box stayed the same distance from the camera for all shots, as well as marking where the Lego man’s feet were positioned inside the box with a pencil. This will provide good pictures, providing you keep the camera at the same distance and zoom for all three photos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cultural Theories of Visual Rhetoric 

== Introduction ==
Social structure often has a major influence on the ways of communication, the impact, and style of all rhetoric. Visual rhetoric is not different in its impact and being impacted by society and different cultural values, ideology, and styles. Symbols and other components of visual rhetoric vary in meaning from culture to culture, and even sometimes within subgroups of cultures. This is reflected in the study of semiotics. [[Semiotics and Visual Rhetoric]] are in summary, signs that can have different quantifiers such as color, perspective, line, etc. These are dictated to a culture through different vehicles, the medians of rhetoric.

Cultural rhetoric is defined by the standards or values that culture attaches to things. This sort of value attachment can even vary within a culture and amongst different groups of people. We see in modern society in America that culture defines the roles of its entire membership and where an acceptable place in society is for these people. The struggle between sexes is one in particular that is perfect for this example. Culture has dictated in the past the placement of men above women, and therefore the power of men’s rhetoric over that of a woman. [[Gender and Visual Rhetoric]] roles are an ideal example of cultural rhetoric viewing the two genders as sub groups of the American culture.

Simply put, cultural rhetoric is a way of framing the words or ideology of a group through a lens that filters or can judge another group’s rhetorical power and value. Cultural rhetoric theories state that a culture is able to dictate values and standards through cultural rhetoric practice. With 
an interdisciplinary approach to understanding cultural theories of visual rhetoric, below is a more in-depth explanation of culture as understood by sociologists and communications scholars.

== Sociological-Cultural Theories ==
Culture affects how we see things. Different cultures perceive things differently. According to Laura Desfor Edles' ''Cultural Sociology in Practice'', “Culture” can be defined in several capacities; (A) humanistic and artistic activities, (B) the manner in which a particular group of people live, their way of life, (C) systems or patterns of shared symbols (1). It is this last method of defining “culture” with which we are most concerned. It is through these systems of shared patterns and symbols that individuals understand their environment, their reality, their life and everything related to their life.

=== Cultural Frames ===
Each individual has their own subjective frame through which they see reality. These frames are created through unique cultural experiences specific to the individual. Cultural frames reject an objective reality. Cultural frames shape how we see ourselves, others and our world. Cultural frames are cumulative they accumulate over time with experience and are constantly changing based on these experiences. The sum of our cultural frames is called our cultural prism. Because each individual experiences life through their own cultural frames, it can be said that there is no one universal objective reality. Each person has their own reality.

''How does this relate to visual rhetoric?''

Often, the focus in both learning as well as teaching visual rhetoric is the need to make certain universal claims regarding its power, uses and meanings. However, if we consider visual rhetoric from the “cultural frames” perspective, there is no universal application of visual rhetoric. Each individual’s cultural frames dictate how they use as well understand visual rhetoric. For example, consider traffic signs. Traffic signs vary from country to country and even sometimes from region to region. Depending on an individual's cultural background, he or she will understand traffic signs differently.

A Japanese &quot;bumpy road&quot; sign [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Japanese_Road_sign_%28Bumpy_road%29.svg] looks strikingly similar to the European sign for &quot;dip&quot; in the road [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Zeichen_112.svg]. Two different concepts represented by the same image in different geographical locations. The interpretation of these signs therefore will vary based on the cultural prism from which an individual views them. 

===Language is Arbitrary and Culture-Specific===

The language we use to describe our world is completely arbitrary. There is no reason that certain words represent certain things. There is no clear connection between the signifier (word/symbol) and the signified (“object in world”). But more importantly, the construction of language is extremely culture-specific. Not only do varying cultures use different words but also these cultures see words differently. For example, consider a tree, a tree can be seen many different ways from varied subject positions and cultural frames. For an environmentalist, a tree is something to be preserved, a relic. For a timber company, a tree is profit. For a politician, a tree can represent a political platform.

''How does this relate to visual rhetoric?''

Visual rhetoric can be considered a language, a visual language and similar to verbal language it is often arbitrary and definitely culture-specific. Consider brand logos. A company's logo is often well-recognized as representing a particular brand but it's actual connection to the brand is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the Starbucks logo ; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Starbucks_in_Nagoya.jpg#file]a green and white Nordic goddess has no relation to coffee products, the brand logo is arbitrary. In addition to being arbitrary, often logos are culture-specific as well arbitrary. While Starbucks is probably a universally recognized logo, an image such as the Duke Dog, James Madison University's mascot is not. The Duke Dog [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:James_Madison_University_3.jpeg]is a culturally-specific symbol, easily understood and recognized by the James Madison University (JMU) culture as their noble mascot and spirit guru, yet most likely considered just a dog to individuals outside the JMU culture. 

===Hegemony===

“The ideas of the ruling class are, in every epoch, the ruling ideas: i.e. the class, which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force (Edles 33).” This description of Hegemony is quoted by Edles from Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' ''German Ideology''. Although the description sounds somewhat convoluted, Marx and Engel touch upon the important idea of the connections between the ruling class and the ruling intellectual force. Hegemony is a fairly simple concept with very complicated definitions. In essence, Hegemony is a theory regarding how dominant classes control the order of society by making their own views appear to be the accepted views. Subordinate classes accept certain ideas, actions or structures as natural when in reality they are actually social constructs created by the dominant classes. “Hegemony is thus the sum of the cultural processes through which ruling groups universalize their own worldview in order to emerge as dominant (Rumbo).”

''How does this relate to visual rhetoric?''

Deconstructing hegemonic constructs is extremely important when investigating any form of rhetoric. To understand certain forms of visual rhetoric, it is necessary to be aware of any potential hegemony. In addition, when participating in visual rhetoric one should be sure not to further any hegemonic constructs that may exist within the culture. Often, media perpetuates hegemonic structures by portraying individuals, the world and life as a particular way. While cultural groups such as African Americans, Hispanics and Asians continue to flourish within the United States, television, movies and advertising continue to portray America as a dominantly White society with little diversity. By constantly being exposed to often &quot;colorblind&quot; media, we accept it is as natural the Hegemony that The United States is a dominantly White country. In interpreting and creating visual rhetoric, it is important to keep in mind the potential Hegemonies.

==Communication-Cultural Theories==

Culture (from a communications standpoint) deals mostly with the rules that govern the understood, misunderstood, acceptable, unacceptable, expected and unexpected ways messages are relayed within a certain community. This community can be as small as an intimate group of friends or as large as a continent. The community is the culture. The message and it's delivery methods is the rhetoric. While theories on cultural rhetoric are usually explained in regards to verbal communication, they adapt well into visual rhetoric.

When verbal literacy is used, it follows guidelines set forth by the governing body and is designated as the national language. Visual literacy is also governed by culture specific values, but which are set for by national groups, they can vary. To be completely visually literate, one must understand all cultural aspects that may play a role in the interpretation of the image. This is where the knowledge and understanding of semiotics is important. The role of nonverbal communication in visual rhetoric connects closely to semiotics and the understanding of a visual argument.

Nonverbal behavior is typically analyzed in-depth in regards to communication. Nonverbal communication itself is culture-based. The cultures one associates with will influence their interpretation and use of non-verbal codes. Nonverbal cues, as explained by Mark P. Orbe and Carol J. Bruess in Contemporary Issues in Interpersonal Communications, can be split up into seven categories, four of which translate well into visual rhetoric (138). 

===Facial and eye communication===

Facial and eye communication through expressions can tell a lot about the message a person is conveying in a picture. The importance of the face can be traced back to the simple fact that when communicating verbally, a person typically looks at the communicator’s face for extra feedback. However, much of facial communication is culture bound (Orbe 142). The seven common facial expressions (sadness, anger, disgust, fear, interest, surprise, and happiness) are innate in people as children. Yet, as a person is socialized into their cultures as adults, these expressions are sometimes hidden or accentuated. For example, Asian cultures teach one to hide any highly emotional thoughts such as sheer excitement. In a painting, it is important to take note of the cultural setting of the characters because their facial expressions may be skewed to fit the culture.

===Proxemics===

Proxemics study the use of space in communications (Orbe 145). Proxemics are also highly culture bound. A photo of a mother and child in each other’s personal space, embraced in a hug automatically brings thoughts of intimacy to an American. This is because intimate distance (touching up to 18 inches apart) is considered primarily inappropriate in U.S. culture. A good example of the extent to this used in recent popular culture is the film, Borat, where a foreign man from Kazakhstan tries to introduce himself to Americans by invading their intimate space [http://flickr.com/photos/mattrothphoto/382360271/]. Borat is not welcomed by Americans who see this as an invasion of their personal space. Proxemics tie in closely with visual rhetoric because the distance between the two objects in a narrative representation may give clues to the relationship and argument conveyed.

===Physical appearance and artifacts===

Physical appearance and artifacts affect communications on a cultural level similar to facial and eye communication. This includes the choice of dress, choice of objects, decoration and the like. Even certain colors are more important than others in a culture (Orbe 154). For example, red, white and blue will have a different emotional connection to an American, Britain or Frenchman than to an Iraqi or South African. To an American, a photograph of a woman in a revealing dress will stimulate a different reaction than the reaction to the same photograph by a group of men from India. Similarly, in this photo [http://flickr.com/photos/webmink/71651/] of a Japanese wedding ceremony, the bride has her hair covered. Understanding that this has the same effect as wearing a wedding veil in western culture adds to the viewers understanding of the image.

===Environment===

The environment can be affected by culture in visual rhetoric. Architecture, room arrangements and colors fall into this category (Orbe 150). This relates closely to time and space in regards to visual rhetoric. Different cultures will react differently in certain environments. A person who grew up in the culture of the &quot;city that never sleeps&quot;, New York, will react to a painting of the Swiss Alps differently than a person who travels the world hiking and mountain climbing.

==Conclusion==

Culture is both influential in how a reader interprets visual rhetoric as well as how a writer composes visual rhetoric. Understanding how cultural theories can influence visual rhetoric is essential. Although this discussion included only Sociological as well as Communication-based theories of culture and visual rhetoric, these theories can be considered the underlying base upon which other cultural theories are developed and understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I wanted to talk about [[compiler construction]] book. I am the original author who started the book. It is very unfortunate that the book appeared abandoned to you. I've been quite busy, so I have not had a time to make progress. I am not sure if you are still working on the book; the history shows no work after February. Though I disagree on some points (surprise?), the bottom line is I am willing to follow your editorial decisions, if you are confident at what you are writing. Please see the talk page of the book for more specific comments. The book would require years of work, but I believe we can at least produce some pieces that are useful, if the book is incomplete. -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|TakuyaMurata]] 23:27, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Analytic Number Theory is the application of Analysis to Number Theoretic Problems.  A quick overview of some portions of Analytic Number theory follow.

=== Zeta function ===
The zeta function defined by

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

for real values of s &amp;gt; 1, plays a central role in the theory.  It is straightfoward to show it converges absolutely when s &amp;gt; 1.  It satisfies the Euler product formula,

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the product is over all prime numbers.  To see this note that multiplying the series definition by 1-2&lt;sup&gt;-s&lt;/sup&gt; and rearranging terms(which is justified since the series converges absolutely) eliminates the even terms, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;(1-2^{-s})(1+\frac{1}{2^s}+\frac{1}{3^s}+\frac{1}{4^s}+\frac{1}{5^s}+\ldots) = (1+\frac{1}{2^s}+\frac{1}{3^s}+\frac{1}{4^s}+\frac{1}{5^s}+\ldots) - (\frac{1}{2^s}+\frac{1}{4^s}+\frac{1}{6^s}+\frac{1}{8^s}+\frac{1}{10^s}+\ldots)
=(1+\frac{1}{3^s}+\frac{1}{5^s}+\frac{1}{7^s}+\ldots)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise after multiplying by 1-3&lt;sup&gt;-s&lt;/sup&gt; all remaining terms with n divisible by 3 are eliminated.  After repeating this process for all primes it follows that 

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) \prod_p \left( 1-p^{-s} \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

since 1 is the only number not divisible by a prime and thus only the n=1 term is left. Solving for &amp;zeta;(s) immediately gives the Euler product formula.

=== Dirichlet series ===

The series for the zeta function is a special case of a Dirichlet series, that is a series of the form

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

Many important arithmetic functions, a(n), have the properties that a(1)=1 and a(m)a(n)=a(mn) when m &amp; n are relatively prime. Such functions are called multiplicative and their associated Dirichlet series may be expressed as an Euler product by

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}} = \prod_p \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a(p^k)}{p^{ks}}&lt;/math&gt;,

as can be shown in a manner similar to the proof for the zeta function.  A completely multiplicative function is one where a(m)a(n)=a(mn) even if m &amp; n are not relatively prime.  For a completely multiplicative function, the Euler product simplifies to 

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a(n)}{n^{s}} = \prod_p \frac{a(p)}{1-p^{-s}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The product of two Dirichlet series is given by the formula

&lt;math&gt;\left( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a(k)}{k^s} \right) \left( \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{b(m)}{m^s} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(a * b)(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

where (a * b)(n) represents the Dirichlet convolution of a &amp; b, which is defined by

&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(n) = \sum_{d|n} a(d)b \left( \frac{n}{d} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Some important Dirichlet series include:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\zeta^\prime (s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s-k) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^k}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s) \zeta(s-k) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_k (n)}{n^s}&lt;/math&gt;
=== Big-Oh notation ===
Many problems involve functions that are incredibly difficult to work with exactly, but where the rate of growth of the function, rather than its exact values, is of primary concern.  Because of this a notation (often called &quot;Big-Oh notation&quot;) was invented. 

&quot;f(x)=O(g(x))&quot; is used to denote that for a sufficiently large number x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there exists a number C such that for all x&amp;gt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left| f(x)\right| \le C g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

&quot;f(x) = g(x) + O(h(x))&quot; is used to denote that f(x)-g(x)=O(h(x))

=== Dirichlet's Theorem ===
One of the first results proven with analytic number theory was Dirichlet's Theorem which states that for any 2 relatively prime integers a &amp; b, there are infinitely many values of k for which ak+b is a prime number.  The proof involves complex-valued functions of the set of integers called Dirichlet characters defined by the properties that &amp;chi;(n) depends only on its residue class modulo a, &amp;chi;(n) is completely multiplicative, and &amp;chi;(n) = 0 iff a and n are not relatively prime.  The principal character &amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be 1 when a &amp; n are relatively prime and 0 otherwise.  It is easy to show that &amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a character.  It can be shown that the number of characters is equal to &amp;phi;(a). It can also be shown that the sum of the values of &amp;chi;(n) over all characters &amp;chi; is equal to &amp;phi;(a) if &lt;math&gt;n\equiv 1\pmod{a}&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise.  The Dirichlet series corresponding to a character is called a Dirichlet L-series and is traditionally denoted by L(s,&amp;chi;).  It is simple to show that L(1,&amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) diverges. Through a complicated argument it is shown that L(1,&amp;chi;) converges and is nonzero if &amp;chi; is nonprincipal.  The function

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{p\equiv b \pmod{a}} \frac{1}{p} = \sum_\chi \frac{L(1,\chi)}{\chi(b)} + O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

must diverge since L(1,&amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/&amp;chi;(b) diverges and the other terms all converge.  Since all terms of the sum on the left are finite its divergence implies there are an infinite number of terms of this sum and thus infinitely many primes of the form ak+b.

=== Riemann zeta function &amp; xi function ===
The zeta function introduced above(the Euler zeta function) converges for all values of s such that Re(s)&amp;gt;1.  The Riemann zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the Euler zeta function, and is defined for all complex values of s except s=1.  Where both functions exist, the Euler and Riemann zeta functions are equal by definition.  It can be shown that if the xi function is defined by

&lt;math&gt;\xi(s)=\frac{1}{2} s(s-1)\Gamma(\frac{s}{2}) \pi^{-\frac{s}{2}} \zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt;

then &amp;xi;(s)=&amp;xi;(1-s).  This is the symmetric form of the famous functional equation for the Riemann zeta function, and provides a convenient way of computing the Riemann zeta function when Re(s)&amp;lt;1.  

The series definition of Euler's zeta function shows that &amp;zeta;(s) has no zeroes for Re(s)&amp;gt;1. It can also be shown that the zeta function has no zeroes with Re(s)=1.  The functional equation shows that for integer values of n, &amp;zeta;(-2n)=0, and any other zeroes lie in the so-called critical strip, 0&amp;lt;Re(s)&amp;lt;1.  The well-known Riemann Hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeros(i.e. those not of the form s=-2n), have Re(s)=1/2.  It is easy to show that the zeroes of the xi function are exactly the nontrivial zeroes of the zeta function.

=== Hadamard product formula ===
The Hadamard product formula states that functions with certain properties(in particular the xi function) are close enough to a polynomial that they may be represented in terms of a product over the zeroes.  For the xi function the Hadamard product formula states that

&lt;math&gt;\xi(s) = e^{A+Bs} \prod_\rho (1 - \frac{s}{\rho})&lt;/math&gt;

for certain values of A and B, where the product is over the zeroes of &amp;xi;(s).  This formula is one of the main reasons the zeroes of the xi function, and thus the zeta function, are of considerable importance.

=== Distribution of squarefree numbers ===
Let S(x) denote the number of squarefree numbers less than or equal to x.  To evaluate this function we begin by counting all integers less than or equal to x.  Then we subtract those that are divisible by 4, those divisible by 9, those divisible by 25, and so on.  We then have removed numbers with 2 repeated prime factors twice those with 3 repeated prime factors 3 times and so on. To remedy the repetition of the numbers with 2 repeated prime factors we add on the number of integers less than or equal to x divisible by 36, those divisble by 100, those divisible by 225 and so on.  We have now reincluded those with 3 repeated prime factors so we uncount them.  Continuing this process gives

&lt;math&gt;S(x) = \sum_{n^2\le x} \mu(n) \left\lfloor \frac{x}{n^2} \right\rfloor = \sum_{n^2\le x} \mu(n)\frac{x}{n^2} + O(\sqrt{x}) = \frac{x}{\zeta(2)} + O(\sqrt{x}) = \frac{6}{\pi^2}x+O(\sqrt{x})&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to information about how common squarefree numbers are this estimate gives information on how they are distributed.
For example to show that there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive squarefree numbers(i.e. that differ by 1) assume there are only finitely many such pairs.  Then there is some x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that all such pairs lie below x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then for n &amp;gt; x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; n and n+1 cannot be squarefree, and thus at most half the integers above x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are squarefree, or more precisely,

&lt;math&gt;S(x)\le \frac{1}{2}(x-x_0) +x_0 + 1 = \frac{x}{2} + O(1)&lt;/math&gt;

but since &lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{\pi^2} &gt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; this contradicts the estimate obtained earlier, thus there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive squarefree numbers.

The estimate also shows that for large enough x, there is at least one squarefree number between x^3 and (x+1)^3.  To see this not that the number of squarefree numbers in that range is

&lt;math&gt;S\left((x+1)^3\right) - S(x^3) = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \left( (x+1)^3 - x^3\right) + O\left(\sqrt{(x+1)^3}\right)+O\left(\sqrt{x^3}\right) = \frac{18}{\pi^2} x^2 + O \left(x^{3 \over  2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is at least one for sufficiently large x.

To do: Add mention of prime number theorem and sieve methods, as well as Dirichlet inversion

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Top bar hives are a style of man made beehive that is based on a cavity covered with sticks or slats usually of wood. Top bar hives have been around for centuries. Evidence of them can be found in ancient Greek and roman ruins. Top bar hives are very popular in undeveloped regions due to ease of construction with materials at hand. Top bars have recently received a surge of popularity in the hobbyist sector of beekeeping all over the world as green alternative to modern stacked white boxes seen everywhere. There are two main classifications of top bar hives the [[Beekeeping/Kenya Top Bar Hives| Kenya Top Bar Hive]] and the [[Beekeeping/Tanzania Top Bar Hives| Tanzania Top Bar Hives]].--[[User:Gary Piant|Gary J Piantanida]] ([[User talk:Gary Piant|talk]]) 18:18, 6 September 2009 (UTC)

==Characteristics==
The two main types of Top Bar Hive in use today are distinguished by their shape and origin. The Kenyan TBH or KTBH has sloped sides resembling a trough and Tanzanian TBH or TTBH which is shaped like a rectangle. What’s the difference?  It is rumored throughout the beekeeping world that sloped sides would prevent the bees from attaching comb to the side walls making it easier to work. To set the record straight these hives have been in existence for centuries and are very popular in third world countries due to ease of construction with materials at hand. In Kenya they are built from hollowed out logs cut in half, sloping the sides was an early attempt to mimic this shape with modern building materials. Most modern beehives are built square the Tanzanian version adapted the bars to more modern square building materials.
	Currently there are no specific dimensions. The average TBH is 4 feet long and 1.5 to 2 feet wide. The KTBH is narrower at the bottom, but no two beekeepers will build them the same. 
Unlike most common designs of modern hives, the top bar hive does not use wooden frames to hold the comb, it uses slats of wood, or (top bars) placed over the cavity the bees inhabit, which is also how the hive received it’s name. Instead of filling out wooden frames, the bees attach comb to the slats. The slat is the only means of support that comb has in a top bar beehive. Also, unlike most other hive designs, the top bar hive does not impose artificial segregation of the colony by physically dividing honey comb from the brood comb by use of separate [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]], divided by a Queen excluder preventing the Queen from using the entire colony to rear brood. The TBH allows the Queen access to the entire colony as she would have in a wild colony.

==Advantages==
Top bar hives have some advantages over traditional hive designs. 
===Simplicity of Design===
Because of the simplicity of the top bar hive’s design, one can be built from readily available salvage materials. In fact the design of a top bar hive is so adaptable that boxes, 55-gallon-drums, old crates and even dilapidated refrigerators can be used to house bees. In essence, nearly any large enough container can be modified to produce a productive top bar hive. All that is required for a top bar hive to be successful are fitting top bars, a water and wind tight cover, an entrance and healthy bees. It is also important to note that the only part design that needs to be precise is the width of the top bar which will be discussed later in the book. Bees are happy to use just about any suitable cavity to establish a colony.

===Price of Construction===
Because of the ability to design and construct TBH hives from scrap and other recycled materials, they can be built extremely inexpensive when compared to other hive designs. When choosing to purchase materials, the total cost of construction will be a fraction of what it would be to build or buy the necessary equipment to start with conventional framed hive styles, due to simplicity of design.

===Ease of Operation===
====Opening the TBH====
Unlike the [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth]] style of hive, the top bar hive does not require lifting heavy [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]] full of bees and honey, commonly referred to as 'supers&quot;. A TBH is accessed by removing the cover exposing the top bars themselves. Because top bars are pushed tightly together there are no gaps for bees to emerge from, the top bars form the ceiling of the hive. Once exposed one top bar at the rear can be worked loose with a hive tool or pocket knife and lifted from the hive body now exposing the adjacent comb. The bar just removed leaves behind the gap the beekeeper will use to manipulate other bars. This bar may or may not have comb suspended from it, if it does it needs to be handled with care. Never turn the comb parallel to the ground as if you were holding a plate of food in one hand, this will cause the comb to break and fall. This comb should be placed in another hive body or on a device made to rest it on while the beekeeper continues working.

====More Manageable Bees====
It has been said by some that manage both top bar hives and [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth hives]] that managing top bar hives is more pleasant as the bees are less stressed when worked and less likely to exhibit defensive behavior. The combs on a top bar hives can be manipulated a few at a time. This smaller disturbance means that inspections exposes and disturbs a much smaller segment of the hive at any given time. Bees in and on the unexposed portion of the hive tend not to notice the beekeeper’s intrusion and as a result seem not to become alarmed.

====Comb by Comb Management====
The ease of comb-by-comb management is due to the horizontal nature of a top bar hive. Combs only need to be disturbed if they are specifically to be managed, this means that if it is desired to increase the brood nest, then simply a new top bar must be installed. Beekeeper can also harvest small portions of comb honey at a time, by simply cutting and removing the desired segment, and then replacing the top bar.

===Storage===
Unlike with standard [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth hives]], there is no extra storage, other than unused top bars, for a top bar hive. Every part of the hive may remain in or on the hive unlike the extra [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]] associated with Langstroth type or &quot;vertical&quot; hives. Less storage means more places to keep bees.

===Bees Wax Production===
Due to the nature of the top bar hives design, combs are not reused as in a framed hive. This facilitates a larger harvest of bees wax. Combs full of honey only are harvested from the rear. The wax is simply crushed by whatever means the beekeeper determines efficient. The crushed wax is then saved and rendered for sale.

Another source of wax comes from the regression process (See regression section) Through the process known as &quot;regression&quot; the brood nest is removed at the beginning of each season to be measured to monitor colony progress and viability for breeding. Once all necessary measurements are recorded this wax is also stored for rendering. 

It is advisable to store wax removed from the brood nest separate from wax that contained only honey. The wax from the brood nest contains cocoons, pollen, and debris tracked in by the bees that contaminate the purity of the wax. The lighter in color the wax the less impurities it contains fetching a higher price in the retail market.

There are many different ways of rendering wax. The two most preferred ways are by use of a solar melter or boiling the wax in large vats of water. Both processes require melting the wax and filtering the debris and allowing it to cool in a container.
Once cooled the debris which settles to the bottom can be scraped off.

===Comb Honey Production===
The top bar hive is by design ideal for &quot;comb honey&quot; honey cut from and which remains in the comb and is often considered more valuable by honey connoisseurs than honey which has been extracted from the comb and bottled. If desired however, a fruit press can be used to separate the liquid honey from the wax comb, such as that produced by a honey extractor.

===Natural Comb===
Because the bees completely build the comb with out using a foundation, top bar hives produce natural sized brood cells, which are advantageous regarding mite control. The wax is also cycled out of the hive during harvest so the hive doesn't accumulate pesticides or other contaminants.

==Disadvantages==
Because they are managed differently to framed hives, inasmuch that honey tends to be harvested a little at a time rather than all at once, top bar hives are less attractive to the commercial beekeeper, who wants to maximize profits by minimizing time spent in harvesting. Other than that, top bar hives have no real disadvantages over framed hives, especially for the smaller-scale beekeeper. During seasons with heavy nectar flow, beekeepers may need to harvest bars of honey more often to prevent the hive from becoming honey bound.
 
===Non-Standard Equipment===
There exist no real standards for top bar hives, because of this the beekeeper must be responsible for construction the top bar hive. However, the existence of standards has frozen the development of beekeeping sometime in the nineteenth century, so this is hardly a disadvantage. On the contrary, the fact of there being no standards has encouraged creative experimentation among top bar beekeepers, who many now regard as being at the leading edge of beekeeping development.

===Less Honey Harvesting===
There is a belief among framed-hive beekeepers that top bar hives are less productive, but no evidence for this has been produced. Wax production, on the other hand, tends to be higher, as comb is not returned to the hive after extraction. This, in itself, is beneficial in terms of disease control, as no potentially disease spore-bearing comb finds its way back into the hive. 

===Delicate Comb===
Because no wired wax foundation is used, there is no reinforcement to the natural structure of the comb. This means that new comb must be handled carefully to avoid breakages.

Welcome to the Portuguese Language Course Wikibook. Good luck - or should we say, {{Word|pt|boa sorte}}!

==Dialogue 1==
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;background:#FFF0F0;&quot;
|
'''Ricardo''': Bom dia. O meu nome é Ricardo. Como está? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Bem, obrigado. E você? &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Estou bem, obrigado. Qual é o seu nome? &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': O meu nome é João. &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Muito prazer. &lt;br&gt;
'''João''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
'''Ricardo''': Adeus! &lt;br&gt;
|}

Analysing each sentence:

* '''{{Word|pt|bom dia|Bom dia}}''' -  translates as (&quot;good day&quot;), but is normally used until 12PM as a short form of &quot;boa manhã/madrugada&quot;(&quot;good morning&quot;) and never after sun down.
Other greetings include:
* {{Word|pt|boa tarde|'''Boa tarde'''|g=good afternoon}}
* {{Word|pt|boa noite|'''Boa noite'''|g=good evening, good night}}.
* {{Word|pt|olá|'''Olá'''|g=hello}} - informal.
* {{Word|pt|oi|'''Oi'''|g=hi}} - informal.
----
* '''O meu nome é Ricardo''' - My name is Ricardo (&quot;Richard&quot; could also be used if pronunciation is an issue).
** {{Word|pt|o|'''O'''|g=the|p=/u/}} - masculine singular definite article;
** {{Word|pt|meu|'''meu'''|g=my|p=/mew/}} - masculine singular first-person singular possessive pronoun;
** {{Word|pt|nome|'''nome'''|g=name|p=/ˈno.mɨ/}} - masculine noun;
** {{Word|pt|é|'''é'''|g=is|p=/ɛ/}} - third-person singular present indicative of verb {{Word|pt|ser|g=to be}};
** {{Word|pt|Ricardo|'''Ricardo'''|g=Ricardo|p=/ʁi.ˈkaɾ.ðu/}}.
* Note that the direct translation would be “the my name is Ricardo.” But in Portuguese you can optionally use the definite article (English ''the'') before possessive pronouns (English “my”, “our”, “his”, etc.;) This sentence is equivalent to “''Meu nome é Ricardo''.”
* In informal language, or in spoken language in general, &quot;Chamo-me João&quot; similar in context to the use of &quot;I'm João&quot;, a more direct translation would be &quot;I'm called João&quot;. João can also be changed into John. 
----
* '''Como está?''' - “How are you?”
** {{Word|pt|como|'''Como'''|g=how|p=/ˈko.mu/}}
** {{Word|pt|estar|'''está'''|g=you are; well|p=/ɨʃ.ˈta/}}
* In this type of situation, the inquiry about someone's state may only be a show of politeness and consideration, an implicit request to engage in personal conversation and an acknowledgment of the other's presence, rather than explicit probe into private matters. The targeted (it may be directed to a group &quot;Como estão?&quot;) is given the opportunity to refuse engagement by keeping the answer simple and positive, like in the example or elaborate and explain if the deeper personal relation is reciprocal or welcomed. This of course depends on the social environment where it takes place...

João then answers:

* '''Tudo bem, obrigado. E você?''' - “All right, thank you.”
** {{Word|pt|obrigado|'''Obrigado'''|g=thank you}} - this can only be used by men. If you are a woman, you must use {{Word|pt|obrigada}} instead.
** {{Word|pt|e|'''E'''|g=and}}
** {{Word|pt|você|'''você'''|g=you}} - this is the second-person singular formal pronoun. Despite being second-person, verbs following it are conjugated in the third-person. The informal second-person pronoun is '''{{Word|pt|tu}}'''.

{{NOTE|The use of &quot;está&quot; indicates deference and opens the reply to use &quot;você&quot; (from &quot;Vos&quot;, 2nd person of I), a more archaic instance would be to use &quot;estáis&quot; (now in complete disuse). If the persons were in familiar terms they would have used &quot;estás&quot; and &quot;tu&quot;. The use of &quot;Tudo bem&quot; can be confusing since it indicates a relaxed stance a more cordial/formal reply would have been &quot;Estou bem&quot; (I'm fine/well).}} 

===Articles===
The English language has three articles: ''the'' (definite article), ''a'' and ''an'' (indefinite articles). Portuguese has four definite and four indefinite articles, as they inflect in [[#Gender|gender]] and [[#Number|number]].

The definite articles are:
* {{Word|pt|o|'''O'''|g=masculine singular|p=/u/}}: ''o homem'' - “the man”
* {{Word|pt|os|'''Os'''|g=masculine plural|p=/uʃ/}}: ''os homens'' - “the men”
* {{Word|pt|a|'''A'''|g=feminine singular|p=/ɐ/}}: ''a mulher'' - “the woman”
* {{Word|pt|as|'''As'''|g=feminine plural|p=/ɐʃ/}}: ''as mulheres'' - “the women”

The indefinite articles are:
* {{Word|pt|um|'''Um'''|g=masculine singular|p=/ũ/}}: ''um homem'' - “a man”
* {{Word|pt|uns|'''Uns'''|g=masculine plural|p=/ũʃ/}}: ''uns homens'' - “some men”
* {{Word|pt|uma|'''Uma'''|g=feminine singular|p=/ˈu.mɐ/}}: ''uma mulher'' - “a woman”
* {{Word|pt|umas|'''Umas'''|g=feminine plural|p=/ˈu.mɐʃ/}}: ''umas mulheres'' - “some women”

Note that the indefinite plural article translates as English ''some''.

===Gender===
The English language has three genders: masculine (''he''), feminine (''she'') and neuter (''it''). Portuguese has two, but, unlike English, all nouns and most pronouns have a gender, even inanimate things like {{Word|pt|casa|g=house, feminine}} and {{Word|pt|ouro|g=gold, masculine}}.

Grammatical gender in Portuguese aren’t always the same as the object’s real gender. For example, {{Word|pt|criança|g=child}} is always a feminine word, whether you are referring to a boy or a girl.

The Portuguese genders are:
* '''masculine'''; and
* '''feminine'''.

As a Portuguese learner, you must memorise the gender of every word. In most cases, the gender of a word can be identified by its ending:
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-o|'''o'''}} are usually masculine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-a|'''a'''}} are usually feminine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-ção|'''ção'''}} are usually feminine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-dor|'''dor'''}} are usually masculine;
* Words ending in {{Word|pt|-ente|'''ente'''}} and {{Word|pt|-ista|'''ista'''}} are usually used for both genders;

===Number===
Like English, Portuguese words can be singular or plural. Portuguese plurals end in '''s'''. Usually the following rules apply:

* Singulars ending in vowels pluralise with '''s''': {{Word|pt|carro|g=car}} → {{Word|pt|carros|g=cars}};
* Singulars ending in '''r''', '''z''' and '''n''' pluralise with '''es''': {{Word|pt|mar|g=sea}} → {{Word|pt|mares|g=seas}};
* Singulars ending in '''s''' pluralise with '''es''' if the stress is in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|país|g=country}} → {{Word|pt|países|g=countries}}; they are the same when plural if the stress is not in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|atlas|g=atlas}} → {{Word|pt|atlas|g=atlases}};
* Singulars ending in '''m''' pluralise with '''ns''' replacing the ''m'': {{Word|pt|bem|g=good}} → {{Word|pt|bens|g=goods}};
* Singulars ending in '''x''' are the same when plural: {{Word|pt|tórax|g=thorax}} → {{Word|pt|tórax|g=thoraxes}};
* Singulars ending in '''il''' pluralise with:
** '''is''' replacing the ''il'' if the stress is in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|canil|g=kennel}} → {{Word|pt|canis|g=kennels}};
** '''eis''' replacing the ''il'' if the stress is not in the last syllable: {{Word|pt|míssil|g=missile}} → {{Word|pt|mísseis|g=missiles}};
* Other singulars ending in '''l''' pluralise with '''is''' replacing the ''l'': {{Word|pt|jornal|g=newspaper}} → {{Word|pt|jornais|g=newspapers}};
* Singulars ending in '''ão''' pluralise with:
** '''ões''' replacing the ''ão'' (most common): {{Word|pt|opção|g=option}} → {{Word|pt|opções|g=options}};
** '''ães''' replacing the ''ão'': {{Word|pt|pão|g=bread}} → {{Word|pt|pães|g=breads}};
** '''s''': {{Word|pt|mão|g=hand}} → {{Word|pt|mãos|g=hands}};

===''Ser'' and ''estar''===
Let's analyse the third line, in which Ricardo answers:
 
'''Estou bem, obrigado.''' - “I am fine, thank you.”

The meaning of ''bem'' and ''obrigado'' have already been explained. The other word, {{Word|pt|estou}} means '''I am'''. It is one of two verbs that translate to our English ‘I am’, the other being {{Word|pt|sou}}.

Consider the following English phrases and their Portuguese translations:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|I '''am''' old. || Eu '''sou''' velho.
|-
|I '''am''' here. || Eu '''estou''' aqui.
|-
|I '''am''' furious. (''I am furious right now'') || Eu '''estou''' furioso.
|-
|I '''am''' furious. (''I am a furious person'') || Eu '''sou''' furioso.
|-
|I '''am''' wearing a hat. || Eu '''estou''' vestindo um chapéu.
|-
|I '''am''' infected. || Eu '''estou''' infectado.
|-
|I '''am''' diabetic. || Eu '''sou''' diabético.
|}

''Estou'' is a form of {{Word|pt|Estar}} and ''sou'' is a form of {{Word|pt|ser}} and both verbs translate as ''to be''. For a Portuguese learner, it is important to know when to use one and when to use the other:

* '''Estar''' implies that something is temporary, that it can be changed. It is used, for example, for being somewhere, for being wearing something, for having a curable disease, for being in a certain state of mind.
* '''Ser''' implies that something is unlikely to change. It is used, for example, for being a certain nationality, for being young, old, a teenager, an adult, etc., for being always big or small, for having an incurable disease.

There some exceptions to these rules. For example, “I '''am''' dead” is “Eu '''estou''' morto.” even though the fact someone is dead is unlikely to change.

'''Estou''' is a form of the verb '''estar'''. Confused? Think of a verb like a tree. On the trunk there's the verb's name - this is called the infinitive. Some examples of infinitives are...

&lt;pre&gt;
 ESTAR      -     SER    -     TER   -    COMER    -    FALAR    -    ABRIR
 To be in        To be       To have      To eat       To speak      To open
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we have to imagine the branches of the tree. Each branch is a different TENSE of the verb. Example? 'I am running' is ''present continuous tense'' because it is happening NOW whereas 'I was running' is ''past continuous tense'' because it happened in the PAST. 

Finally, the leaves on the branches are different CONJUGATIONS. Example? We say 'I run' and 'you run' but 'he/she/it runS' with an 's' on the end. This is a different conjugation of the present indicative tense of the verb 'to run'. However in Portuguese there are more conjugations than in English.

Let's take a look at the conjugations for the verb ESTAR. We already know that one of them will be 'está', from the dialogue.

&lt;big&gt; '''ESTAR - To Be in''' &lt;/big&gt;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;á&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Você est&lt;/td&gt;

 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;N&amp;oacute;s est&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;amos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (plural) are&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Vocês est&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eles est&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Look back at the dialogue. Ricardo says '''Estou bem'''. We can see that the first word means 'am'. '''Bem''' simply means 'well'. So we have 'Am well.' We seem to be missing the 'I'! However, in Portuguese, because there are different conjugations for the different people, you can often leave out the 'I, we, they' etc. if it is obvious. In the case of 'I' and 'we' it is always obvious in the present tense.

There's also always a bit of confusion at the start between the different forms of 'you'.

*   '''Tu''' – This is really mostly used in Portugal, and some regions from Brazil. It is a really casual way of saying ‘you’ – used between close friends or to children. If in doubt, don’t use it, use 'o senhor/a senhora' (masculine/feminine).
*  '''Você''' – It only refers to one person. Used in informal speech mainly in Brazil.
*  '''Vocês''' – Plural form of ‘tu’ or ‘você’.

There is also one other form of you: '''Vós'''. However this form is less used and is mostly used by people in Northern Portugal and in classic literature. Therefore we shall ignore this form of &quot;you&quot;. However if you need to understand it, the grammar references on this Wikibook include '''Vós''' - which, I should point out, is like '''vocês''' -  it is currently only used when talking to more than one person. Still confused? Check out the [[Portuguese/Contents/Personal Pronouns of Subject|Personal Pronouns of Subject]] page.

'''Muito prazer''' means ''It's a pleasure''.

'''Adeus''' means ''goodbye''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi,

I liked your suggestion!!!

Are you working on this... or is this just an idea? Do you have the support of the Wikivarsity community?
[[User:SudarshanP|SudarshanP]] 05:22, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

----

Thank you!

Yes, I'm actually working on it, although slowly.
Since the idea has not boiled enough I cannot simply implement it, so I'm elaborating it and it evolves from time to time. I'm also thinking about writing an article and sending it to some CS journal.

Unfortunately, there is no support whatsoever. Your comment is the only one I have.
--[[User:Catpad|Catpad]] 07:51, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I thought I would leave a note to say I found your idea of Odzilla very interesting. It's true to say that many courses could use the same base materials (or different &quot;flavours&quot; of these as you say) and this could save us having to repeat these materials. However, each course will have it's own focus and learning outcomes, so i think we may need to overlap some material - just as many Wikipedia articles overlap to some extent with other articles in the same area. But I don't think I fully understand this idea yet, so I'll give it another go..

:As for &quot;support&quot; - don't worry - things happen slowly (and have been moving far too slowly in Wikiversity in my opinion) but good ideas will get recognised in time. As we know, Wikiversity is in a kind of limbo at the moment, but I for one am going to try to revive it somewhat, or at least start studying it for my PhD to make some recommendations. On that note, if you feel confident enough, you should definitely try to write a paper and publish it somewhere visible to the wikimedia community, even if a journal won't have it. 

:Good luck. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 12:58, 7 October 2005 (UTC)


==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The NAIC&amp;reg; Stock Selection Guide&amp;reg; is a form designed by the 
National Association of Investors Corporation to help evaluation 
potential investments in individual common stocks.  It uses 
fundamental analysis to evaluate potential investments for both 
growth and value.

==Identifying Quality Growth Companies==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate historical growth trends in revenue (sales), pre-tax profit (PTP) and earnings per share (EPS).  For each of these you want to see relatively consistent compound growth.  You also want to see all three growing at similar rates.

This is also where you make judgment decisions to estimate the potential future sales and EPS values.  This potential future EPS value is produced either from an estimated future EPS growth rate or from an estimated future income statement.  The later method is referred to as &quot;preferred procedure&quot; (which does not necessarily suggest that it's always to be &quot;preferred&quot; over the former method.

==Evaluating Management==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate trends in historical pre-tax profit margins (pre-tax profit as a percentage of revenue) and return on equity.  For each of these you want to see stability or improvement as well as superiority when compared with other companies in the same industry.

==Evaluating Past P/E Ratios==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate the current PE level in the context of historical PE levels.  The historical PE levels help establish a &quot;typical&quot; level and range of PE values specific to this stock (sometimes refered to as a &quot;signature PE&quot;).  Current PE level is compared with this &quot;typical&quot; level to produce Relative Value (RV), which is the current PE level expressed as a percentage of the typical historical level.

The concept of PE (Price divided by Earnings, or PE ratio) is sometimes likened to price-per-pound (or unit pricing) in a grocery store.  Unit product pricing allows you to compare the value of the underlying product without regard to the price of that product when packaged in various quantities.  PE ratio allows you to compare the &quot;per-pound&quot; price of the underlying &quot;product&quot; (the level of EPS produced by the company) without regard to how the product is packaged (as shares).  

To determine the value of bananas in the grocery store (regardless of how many bananas you plan to buy) you need to know how much it costs to buy one pound of bananas (price per pound), not how much it costs to buy one banana or one bunch of bananas.  To help determine the value of a stock investment you need to know how much it costs to buy one dollar of EPS produced by that company (price per &quot;pound&quot;), not how much is costs to buy one share of the stock.  Buying one share of stock is like buying one banana;  PE ratio is like the price per pound of the bananas.

==Evaluating Potential Future High and Low Prices==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you establish a potential future high and low price.  These are compared with the current price to estimate both a potential &quot;up-side&quot; (how much the price might go up) and a potential &quot;down-side&quot; (how much the price might go down).  US/DS Ratio is the &quot;up-side&quot; as a percentage of the &quot;down-side&quot;, a way or measuring the risk of the investment.

==Evaluating Potential Future Total Return==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Here is where you evaluate the overall potential for gain over five years from investing at the current price.  This is done by combining the potential for price appreciation over five years (the &quot;up-side&quot; described earlier) with an estimate of future dividend yield (if any).  This overall potential for gain is represented as an annualized five-year rate of growth and is refered to as &quot;Total Return&quot;.  The level of Total Return required to double an investment over five years is approximately 15% (14.870%).

==Total Return vs. Projected Average Return==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

Total Return (TR) is the measure of overall potential gain traditionally used on the SSG.  TR assumes a potential future price based on a future &lt;U&gt;high&lt;/U&gt; PE level.  Projected Average Return (PAR) is another measure of overall potential gain.  PAR assumes a potential future price based on a future &lt;U&gt;average&lt;/U&gt; PE level.  Both TR and PAR assume the same future high EPS level.  The amount of PE expansion assumed to be achievable is greater with TR than with PAR.

==Sensitivity of Total Return to Changes in High PE and High EPS==
{{stage short|00%|Apr 15, 2005}}

&lt;math&gt;%chgPE&lt;/math&gt; = percentage by which high PE is changed

&lt;math&gt;%chgEPS&lt;/math&gt; = percentage by which high EPS is changed

&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = time period over which Rate (i.e., TR or PAR) is calculated
  
&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt[n]{\left(1+%chgPE\right) \left(1+%chgEPS\right)} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;%chgRate = c * (1 + 1/Rate)\ &lt;/math&gt;, the resulting percentage change in Rate 

or, with &lt;math&gt;GF = 1+Rate&lt;/math&gt;, GF being the growth factor associated with Rate

&lt;math&gt;%chgRate = c \cdot GF / (GF-1)\ &lt;/math&gt;

As the need for rapid calculations increased, commercial organisations introduced the [[Wikipedia:electronic calculator|electronic calculator]] to the market. Then the [[Wikipedia:computer|computer]] appeared.

The price of computers decreased, and they started appearing in more businesses, and then also in schools, libraries, and wealthier governments.

The [[Wikipedia:Internet|Internet]] connected computers together and provided more information to users, but there were also problems such as fraudulent websites, overabundant commercial emails, copyright violations, server outages, and lack of connectivity to poorer countries.

The dawn of the computer age brought about some disadvantages, such as incompatible file formats, fears about privacy, and error messages such as the [[Wikipedia:Blue Screen of Death|Blue Screen of Death]].

==Prequel==

===About Lithuanian language itself===

The Lithuanian language belongs to the Baltic group of Indoeuropean languages. The other language in this group is Latvian, so if you know Latvian you may find it easy to learn Lithuanian. The languages are more different from each other than, for example, different Romance languages. They are also called Balto-Slavs because they share striking similarities with the Slavs, especially Russian and Polish. Like the Slavs, they have genders, noun cases, tenses, plurals and so on. There are no articles. Prepositions are avoided in favour of case endings. E.g. &quot;namas&quot; means &quot;house&quot;, while &quot;name&quot; means &quot;in a/the house&quot;). Therefore the Lithuanian language might seem hard at first to learn for people who are used to languages with a different structure.

===About usage of Lithuanian language===

Lithuanian is the official language of the Republic of Lithuania, which has about 3.5 million people, of which 83% are ethnic Lithuanians. There are Lithuanian communities in the neighboring countries of Poland and Latvia, where some villages have Lithuanian majorities.  Larger communities of Lithuanians existed in Belarus and what is now Kaliningrad Oblast' of Russia.  There also exist traditional emigrant communities, mostly in America and Australia, of people who are descendents of interwar emigrants. There are also new emigrant communities, made up of people emigrating now, largely in Spain, the UK and Ireland. Some of the old emigration trends, e.g. USA, remained too, while others disappeared (e.g. South America).

===About dialects===

==Lithuanian writing and pronouncing==
===The Lithuanian alphabet===
Lithuanian alphabet is a modified Latin alphabet. Consists of the following 32  letters (in order):
*A – the long or the short A (see the pronouncing rules above), [a / ā].
*Ą (A nosinė) – long A, [ā].
*B – like B in bag, [b / b'].
*C – like English Ts (e.g. in Tsar), [ts / t's'].
*Č – like English Tsh (T and then sh), [t&amp;#643; / t&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#643;&lt;/sup&gt;' / t'&amp;#643;'].
*D – like D in dog, [d / d'].
*E – long or short E, (see the pronouncing rules below), [e / æ].
*Ę (E nosinė) – long E, [æ].
*Ė – is like German e and long (see the pronouncing rules below), [ē].
*F – like English F or PH (e.g. in fog), [f / f'].
*G – like G in golf, [g / g'].
*H – like H in Hungary, [h / h']
*I –  short i, like i in English big; i in a diphthong, like y in say, the palatalization mark  [i / ǐ / &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;].
*Į (I nosinė) – long i (see the pronouncing rules below), [ī]. 
*Y (I ilgoji) – second long i (see the pronouncing rules below), [ī]. 
*J – like Y in the English word young [j].
*K – like K in Kilometer, [k / k'].
*L – like L in long, [l / l'].
*M – like M in Mike, [m / m'].
*N – like N in november or N in link [n / n' / &amp;#627; /&amp;#627;'].
*O – long or (rare) short O, [ō / o].
*P – like P in Pong, [p / p'].
*R – like Spanish R, [r / r'].
*S – like S in song, [s / s'].
*Š – slightly less tight than English Sh (e.g. in Shell) [&amp;#643; / &amp;#643;'].
*T – like T in Tango, [t / t'].
*U – short u, like oo in English food, u in a diphthong, like w in cow [u / ǔ]
*Ų (U nosinė) – long U, [ū].
*Ū (U ilgoji) – long U, [ū].
*V – medial sound between English [v] and [w]; [v / v']].
*Z – like Z in Zone, [z /z'].
*Ž – voiced variant of Š, [&amp;#658; / &amp;#658;'], the sound in the middle of English &quot;Treasure&quot;.
*Ch – these letters together are pronounced as an unvoiced variant of Lithuanian h, like ch in scottish loch, [χ / χ' ]. 

The letters W, X and Q are not used in Lithuanian except in proper names (e. g. Washington'o miestas). 
The letters F, H and the digraph Ch are only used in loaned words, known in many European languages (e. g. Chemija)

===The pronouncing of consonants===
====The rules====
# Any Lithuanian consonant may be palatalized. Palatalized consonants are pronounced softly, as before [i], but not palatalized are pronounced hardly, stiffly. 
#* Consonants are palatalized when they go directly before e (ę or ė) or i (į or y). Consonants, that go directly before other vowel letters should be pronounced not palatalized. 
#*The letter i in digraphs ia (ią), io, iu (ių, iū) plays a role of the palatalization mark (see The pronouncing of vowels).
#*Consonants, that go directly before any palatalized consonant are palatalized too. It mean, that palatalization takes effect in a group of consonants, when the last consonant of the group is directly before e (ę or ė) or i (į or y). 
#* Consonants, that go directly before any not palatalized consonant are not palatalized, except the consonant [l] in few cases. 
#*Consonant [j] doesn't have a not palatalized pronouncing. 
# Voiced consonants directly before unvoiced ones become similar to unvoiced. And, in the same way, unvoiced consonants directly before voiced ones assimilate to voiced ones. 
#* Unvoiced – voiced consonant pairs are: [b] – [p], [d] – [t], [g] – [k], [h] – [χ], [z] – [s] and [&amp;#658;] - [&amp;#643;]
#* Voiced consonants [l], [m], [n], [r], [v] don't have a pair unvoiced sounds, they pronounced less voiced than in general, and unvoiced consonants don't became voiced before them. 
#* Unvoiced consonant [j] doesn't have a pair voiced sound, and assimilation of the prior sound is almost insensible before [j]. 
# Consonants [b] – [p], [d] – [t], [g] – [k], [h] – [χ] are pronounced much less aspired than their English counterparts. 
#The consonant letter n is pronounced [&amp;#627;] before k or g and [n] in other cases.

Note: This simplified transcription is only used in wikipedia. In many study sources of the Lithuanian language no transcription is used or the more sophisticated, scientific transcription is used.

===The pronunciation of vowels===
====The rules==== 
#Any vowel sound has two variants, the long and the short in Lithuanian language. 
#*Letters a, e can be read long ([ā] , [æ]) or short ([a], [e]), depending on the word and its form (case, tense, etc.). The long a or e of this kind may appear once in a word. 
#*Letters ą, ę, ė, į, y, ų, ū are always pronounced long ([ā], [æ], [ē], [ī], [ū]). 
#*Letters u, i are always pronounced short ([u], [i]) (except cases, when they are a part of diphthongs).
#*Letter o is pronounced long ([ō]) at most, but in the case of many loaned words it's pronounced short [o] in word root. 
#*Possible short variant of [ē] and more often short variant of [æ] are marked with the same [e] here. They aren't distinguished in spelling too.
#There are few cases, when a vowel letter is pronounced not like a vowel sound:
#*The letter i directly before a (ą), o, u (ų, ū) (but not e!) (in ia, ią, io, iu, ių, iū and not ie) isn't pronounced and marks the palatalization (see above). This usual rule has few exceptions in [[w: stem (linguistics) |stems]] of some loaned words, most of them are known in many other European languages (e. g. pianinas [pijan'''i'''nas] 'a piano', pionierius [pijon'''i'''er&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;us] 'a pioneer').
#*The letters i and u in ai, ei, ie, ui, uo are parts of respective diphthongs. This rule has few formal exceptions of the same kind as the previous, but in fluent Lithuanian these exceptions usually aren't seen.

===The accent=== 

# The accent in Lithuanian is free (not connected with any particular syllable or sound). Accents of the different forms of the same word also may differ. 
# The accent in Lithuanian has three forms, all of which have different pronunciation in different cases. These three forms are: the initial long syllable accent, the final long syllable accent and the short syllable accent. When we have a single vowel (not a diphthong) in an accented  syllable, the form of stress also indicates, if the vowel is long or short. 

In this wikibook the Lithuanian accent is marked by printing the respective vowel bold. This allows the initial and the final accents in syllables containing a diphthong to be distinguished, as far as is sufficient for intermediate knowledge of Lithuanian.

Note: In the vocabularies the three forms of accent are often marked with three marks - the final long syllable accent with a circumflex mark (^), the initial long syllable accent with an acute mark (´) and the short syllable stress with the grave mark (`), but the meaning of these marks differs from their usage in most other European languages (e. g. in the Greek language).

==Lithuanian grammar==
===The main things on verbs===
*Verbs have three different main tenses, that allows as to express an action in the past, in the present and in the future. The fourth tense is used to express a repeated action in the past (it's called the past iterative tense). 

:Verbs of different tenses have different endings. The stems of a verb them often are different (although not much) in different tenses.

||'to carry', 'to bear' (I carried – I carry/ I'm carrying &lt;br&gt; – I'll carry– I used to carry) 
|} 

:One may notice, that stems of the past iterative tenses don't differ from respective stems of the future tense, except the last consonant. This refers to an actual rule in Lithuanian. 


*Lithuanian verbs may have more forms, that are like tenses, but we'll leave them for the further. 
*Verbs have five persons in every tense. Every person has it's own endings, and this system is almost regular. 
*# The first singular person always ends with u, but actual its ending may be longer.  
*#* renk'''u''' 'I gather' or 'I'm gathering' (the present tense) 
*#* veiki'''u''' 'I do' or 'I act' (the present tense) 
*#*tyli'''u''' 'I keep silence' (the present tense)

** The future tense and the past iterative tense have regular endings

{|
!'''Person'''
!'''Ending of the future tense &lt;br&gt; with the suffix'''
!'''Forms of the future tense''' 
|-
||1st singular 
|| -siu 
||r'''i'''nksiu, ve'''i'''ksiu, tyl'''ė'''siu, man'''y'''siu 
|-
||2nd singular 
|| -si 
||r'''i'''nksi, ve'''i'''ksi, tyl'''ė'''si, man'''y'''si 
|-

|-

|-
||2nd plural 
|| -site 
||r'''i'''nksite, ve'''i'''ksite, tyl'''ė'''site, man'''y'''site
|}

::Note, that the future tense, as an exclusion, hasn't any ending without the suffix s at all in the 3rd person.

|-
||2nd plural 
|| -davote 
||r'''i'''nkdavote, ve'''i'''kdavote, tyl'''ė'''davote, man'''y'''davote 
|}

**There are also few other suffixes, used in the present or in the past tense, that have their own regular endings for every person. 

====The personal pronouns====

Verbs may be used in a sentence without personal pronouns, but personal pronouns are useful, especially for the 3rd person. 

{|
!
!'''singular'''
!
!'''plural'''
|-
||1st person 
|| aš [a&amp;#643;] 'I'
|| 
|| mes [mæs] 'we' 
|-
||2nd person 
|| tu 'you' &lt;br&gt; (singular!)
||
|| jūs 'you' 
|-
||2rd person 
|| ji 'she', jis 'he' 
||
|| jos 'they (feminine)', &lt;br&gt; jie 'they' 
|}

Note: 
*Here are forms of the [[w:nominative case|nominative]] only in the table. You should use forms of other cases to speak about something or somebody as a direct object or as an indirect object.  
*It's polite to use the 2nd plural person instead of the second singular in the official style  . Remember, that you should speak in this case as if you deal with many people,  not simply changing ''Tu'' to ''Jūs'' only. For example: not &lt;strike&gt;''tu eini'' → ''jūs eini''&lt;/strike&gt;, but ''tu eini'' → ''jūs einate''. 

====The simplest sentences====

*The simplest sentence consists of a single verb. But everybody feels that such a sentence is too unclear. We'll skip this point here. 

*The next step is a sentence with a subject and a verb. The subject should be put in the [[w:nominative case|nominative]] [[w:case (linguistics)|case]]. Word order is either S-V or the V-S. The S-V is more common, although native English speakers shouldn't forget, that the second possibility sometimes may be used too.
*: &lt;br&gt;
*:'''Examples (the S-V – the V-S):''' 
**merg'''a'''itė v'''a'''lgo [v'''ā'''lgō] 'a girl eats' 
**:v'''a'''lgo [v'''ā'''lgō] merg'''a'''itė  '' 'a girl'' eats' 
**berni'''u'''kas pi'''e'''šė 'a boy drew' 
**:pi'''e'''šė berni'''u'''kas '' 'a boy'' drew' 
**mes [mæs] l'''i'''ksime 'we'll stay' 
**:l'''i'''ksime mes [mæs] '' 'we'' 'll stay' 
**kas [kas] n'''o'''ri [n'''ō'''ri]? 'who wants?' 
**:(the V-S isn't used)
**liet'''u'''s l'''y'''ja 'it rains', literally 'a rain rains' (less common than with the V-S)
**:l'''y'''ja liet'''u'''s 'it rains', literally 'a rain rains' (the main variant in such case)

: &lt;br&gt;
*Going further, we could add the object to a sentence. The object may be added anywhere in a sentence in Lithuanian. When one changes the place of the object, intonation of the sentence and some fine nuances (which we'll skip here) of its meaning change too. 
*The object may be in one of few cases, and it depends on what kind of the object we have. 
*: &lt;br&gt;
*:'''Examples:'''
**merg'''a'''itė valgo [vāl...] '''o'''buolį 'a girl eats an apple' (the object is in  the  [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**berni'''u'''kas piešė k'''a'''tiną [k'''ā'''t...]  'a boy drew a cat' (the object is in the [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**kas [kas] n'''o'''ri p'''i'''eno? 'who wants some milk?' (the object is in  the [[w:genitive case|genitive]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**jis n'''o'''ri arb'''a'''tos [...b'''ā'''t...] 'he wants some tea' (the object is in  the [[w:genitive case|genitive]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**:j'''i'''s arbatą [...b'''ā'''t...] g'''e'''rs [g'''e'''rs]  'he will drink a tea' (the object is in  the  [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**j'''i''' neužm'''i'''ršta draugės 'she don't forget the friend' (the object is in the [[w:genitive case|genitive]] [[w:case |case]]). 
**: ji par'''a'''šė [...r'''ā'''...] draugei l'''a'''išką 'she have wrote a letter for a friend' (the direct object is in the [[w:accusative case|accusative]] [[w:case |case]], the indirect one is in the [[w:dative case|dative]] [[w:case |case]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is how to burn &quot;ham sandwich&quot; such as DreamSNES, NesterDC, SMEG, MAMED, MAMEDC, and NeoPoccot. (Those are the emulators that I burned using this method, but I am pretty sure that it works with every self-bootable emulator for the Dreamcast.) Making a ROM disc is covered in the second section.

==Emulators==
Burning a self-bootable emulator for the Dreamcast isn't difficult. These are the tools you need:
*[http://www.dchomebrew.org/mactools.shtml Mac Pack 4.0]
*Roxio Toast 5, 6, or 7
**In Toast 7, make sure you have &quot;Show Legacy Formats&quot; turned on in the preferences.
*A program that can save SimpleText documents, such as [http://www.jedit.org/ jEdit].

First, you will need to download a DiscJuggler image—a &lt;tt&gt;.cdi&lt;/tt&gt; file—of the emulator. Most, if not all, websites have zipped the emulator, and the archive will have to be unzipped by a program such as MacRAR or StuffIt Expander. Once the file is unzipped, open '''CDIRip 0.5''' in the Mac Pack Applications folder and select the &lt;tt&gt;.cdi&lt;/tt&gt; file. Select a file in the directory that you want to save in, and wait until the CDIRip process says &quot;All done, good burning! Click to exit.&quot; After this process, you'll have two new files: an audio file and a data file. You will now have to copy the '''Isofix Config File''', which can also be found in the Mac Pack Applications folder. Drag it to where the emulator's files are.


Open the file named '''CDIRip CDI Analysis''' with a text editor. (The file was created when the CDIRip process was completed.) Copy the number following &quot;LBA:&quot; of the second session. (It's usually a five-digit number.) Now open the '''Isofix Config File''' with a text editor. (It was the file you copied earlier.) Its text should be exactly what follows*:

:&lt;tt&gt;isofix&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;''xxxxx''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;mac&lt;/tt&gt;

Replace whatever number is on the second line (where the ''x'''s are in the example) and paste the LBA number that you copied from the CDIRip CDI Analysis file.

Open '''Isofix 1.3'''—which is also located in the Mac Pack Applications folder—and it will ask you for the ISO to work with. That would be the data (generally the second) session created by CDIRip 0.5. (In my test, it was called ''Session 2 Track 02 Data'', but that may not be the case for everyone.) It will then ask you for the ISO Config file. Open the now-edited config file and wait for the process to end. (It may take some time, so don't think that your computer has frozen.) Now, when it is done you should notice three new files: &lt;tt&gt;bootfile.bin&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;fixed.iso&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;header.iso&lt;/tt&gt;. Trash &lt;tt&gt;bootfile.bin&lt;/tt&gt;: you don't need it.

Open Toast and select ''Disc Image'' from the ''Other'' menu in Toast 5, or on the left under the ''Copy'' tab in Toast 6 and 7. Drag your &lt;tt&gt;fixed.iso&lt;/tt&gt; file into Toast and burn it as ''Write Session''. (In Toast 6 and 7, these options are located under the ''Advanced'' tab on the screen where you can select the burn speed.) When it is done, close Toast and open it up again. This time, select ''Multitrack CD-ROM XA'' and drag &lt;tt&gt;header.iso&lt;/tt&gt; into Toast. Burn it as ''Write Disc''.

Insert the disc into your Dreamcast, power it on, and your emulator should load.

==ROMs==
You'll need toast.

THIS IS HOW I DID IT, FIRST YOU'LL NEED TOAST (I USE 5.0) BUT OTHER VERSIONS WILL WORK. DOWNLOAD ALL THE ROMS YOU WANT AND THEN UNZIP THEM ALL. THEN OPEN UP TOAST. HOLD DOWN OTHER AND SET IT TO ISO 9660. DRAG ALL OF YOUR ROMS TO THIS AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THESE SETTINGS. CD-ROM, ISO9660 LEVEL 1, APPEND VERSION NUMBERS CHECKED AND USE APPLE EXTENSIONS UNCHECKED, NOW CLICK DONE AND DRAG ALL OF YOUR ROMS TO TOAST AND BURN IT AS WRITE DISC.

To burn any nonself bootable emu on dcemu.com

You'll need Toast

First download the plain files then extract them. Make a roms folder and throw all of your roms in that folder. Now open toast and select ISO 9660. Make sure you follow these exact settings...

CD-rom

ISO 9660 Level 1

Append Version Numbers checked rechecked and checked again

Use Apple Extensions unchecked

Now burn it as write disc. and as non-write disc

Insert the bootdisc then the switch the disc with the emu.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of uncertainties in related physical quantities (e.g. position and momentum, energy and time, etc.) has a finite lower bound. This arises from the fact that the momentum and position operators do not commute. A common misunderstanding is that in simple terms this means that a measurement for position disturbs the momentum of a particle, and a measurement for the momentum of a particle dirsurbs its position. All of this information is false.

In other words, if you know the position of a particle and you measure the momentum, it disturbs the position - thus you are less certain of its position.  This is incorrect.

In actuality, the uncertainty arises from fundamental underlying physical laws governing physical systems which can be measured.  Particles have a fundamental dual nature and may be considered either a point source or a probability distribution of position depending upon what one is trying to accomplish by interacting with the particle.

Repeated measurements of particles in known/delivered states will give a distribution range governed by a probability function for either of the two conjugate properties, position (x) or momentum (p).  The Uncertainty Principle gives a mathematically provable lower bound of the product of the uncertainty (error or deviation from a precise center of the probability wave law) in the measured conjugate properties.  

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x\Delta p \ge\frac{\hbar}{2}=\frac{\frac{h}{2\pi}}{2}\, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 3.14 &lt;/math&gt; and h is Planck's constant with &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; being Planck's reduced constant.

Thus the precision with which one can know one property is related mathematically to what is known of the conjugate property.  If position is known with great precision for a specific particle or wave then the conjugate momentum is &lt;b&gt;not known&lt;/b&gt; with a precision greater than that allowed by the lower bound provided by the Uncertainty Principle equation shown above.

Here is the derivation for the general uncertainty principle for two operators, A and B, that do not commute.

Let iC be the commutator of A and B:

[A,B] = iC

Furthermore, A and B are Hermitian operators.  Recall the definition of the uncertainties:

&lt;math&gt;\left(\Delta A\right)^{2} = \langle\left(A- \langle A\rangle\right)^{2}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\Delta B\right)^{2} = \langle\left(B- \langle B\rangle\right)^{2}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

To do:

Find a mathematically simple derivation of uncertainty principle and provide it here.

Find an intuitive example and provide here.

Provide a variety of equivalent derivations using different techniques to allow understanding by widest possible audience.

'''Bouillabaisse''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] [[Cookbook:Stew|stew]] originating from the port city of [[w:Marseille|Marseille]].

This dish is made by boiling several [[w:species|species]] of fish with herbs and vegetables. The [[cookbook:broth|broth]] is then served as a soup poured over bread seasoned with [[w:rouille|''rouille'']] (a spicy French [[w:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]) with the fish and vegetables served separately. The exact proportions of these ingredients vary by cook and region.

The ''Charte de la Bouillabaisse Marseillaise'' (the Charter of Marseillaise Bouillabaisse )&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toquentete.net/deran_charte_de_la_bouillabaisse.php Charte de la Bouillabaisse Marseillaise]&lt;/ref&gt; was signed in 1980 by 11 restaurants in France in an attempt to standardize the definition of  a bouillabaisse. According to the charter, bouillabaisse must be prepared with at least four of the following fish: [[w:Monkfish|monkfish]], [[w:John Dory|John Dory]], [[w:Galinette|galinette]] (or [[w:Gunard|gunard]]), [[w:Mullett|mullett]], [[w:Scorpion fish|rascasse]], [[w:Conger eel|conger eel]], and [[w:chapon|chapon]] ([[w:Rascasse rouge|rascasse rouge]], or red scorpion fish).  Most versions will contain at least rascasse to be considered authentic.

==Traditional bouillabaisse==
This recipe comes from one of the most traditional Marseille restaurants, ''Grand Bar des Goudes'' on ''Rue Désirée-Pelleprat''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis André, ''Cuisines des pays de France'', Éditions du Chêne, 2001 &lt;/ref&gt;

===For the broth===
* 660 grams [[w:sea robin|sea robin]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:scorpionfish|scorpionfish]], sliced
* 660 grams red [[w:Gurnard|gurnard]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:conger|conger]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:lotte|lotte]], or [[w:monkfish|monkfish]], sliced
* 660 grams [[w:John Dory|John Dory]], sliced
* 1 live [[w:octopus|octopus]] (optional)&lt;ref&gt; Octopus is used in bouillabaisse only in the Goudes quarter of Marseille, according to Jean Louis André, ''Cuisines des Pays de France'' &lt;/ref&gt;, cut into pieces
*10 [[w:sea urchins|sea urchins]]
*1 kilogram of [[w:potato|potato]]
*7 cloves of [[w:garlic|garlic]]
*3 [[w:onions|onions]], sliced
*5 ripe [[w:tomato|tomatoes]], peeled, quartered and without seeds
*1 cup of [[w:olive oil|olive oil]]
*1 [[w:bouquet garni|bouquet garni]]
*1 branch of [[w:fennel|fennel]]
*8 threads of [[w:saffron|saffron]]
*10 slices of [[w:pain de campagne|country bread]]
*salt and [[w:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
''Note: Finding the species of fish listed above may be difficult. If so, substitute any combination of four of five species with firm, white flesh''

===For the ''rouille''===
*1 egg yolk
*2 cloves of garlic
*1 cup of olive oil
*10 threads of saffron
*salt and cayenne pepper
''Note: Serve this dish without rouille to reduce the fat and cholesterol in this dish.''

===Preparation===
#Scale the fish and wash them, if possible, in sea water. Cut them into large slices, leaving the bones. Wash the octopus and cut into pieces. 
#Warm the olive oil in a large, deep [[w:saucepan|saucepan]].
#Add the onions, along with six cloves of crushed garlic, the octopus pieces and tomatoes. Brown at low heat turning gently for five minutes.
#Add the fish slices; first the large slices then the smaller ones. Cover with boiling water and add salt, pepper, fennel, the  ''bouquet garni'' and saffron. Boil at a low heat, stirring from time to time so the fish doesn't stick to the pan. Correct the seasoning. Remove the bouillabaise from the heat once the oil and water have thoroughly blended with the other ingredients. This should take about twenty minutes.
#Prepare the ''rouille'':  Use a mortar to crush the garlic cloves into a fine paste after removing the stems. Add the egg yolk and the saffron, then blend in the olive oil little by little to make a mayonnaise, stirring it with the pounder of the mortar. 
#Cook the potatoes, peeled and boiled and cut into large slices, in salted water for 15 to 20 minutes. Open the sea urchins with a pair of scissors and remove the [[w:sea urchin#as food|roe]] with a small spoon. 
#Arrange the fish on a platter. Add the sea urchin roe into the broth and stir. 
#Rub several slices of bread with garlic and spread a tablespoon of ''rouille'' on each. Place at least two slices per serving bowl.
#Remove the fish and potatoes from the broth and place them on a large serving platter.
#Pour the hot broth in each bowl containing a slice of bread smothered in ''rouille''. Then serve the fish and the potatoes on a separate platter.

A '''herring''' is a type of small oily fish found in the temperate, shallow waters of the North Atlantic.  A smaller variant lives in the Baltic Sea.

Herring can be cooked in the usual ways for small fish - [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]], [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] or [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]].

Herrings can also be [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] and served in a sour cream sauce.

A '''kipper''' is a split and smoked herring, and a '''bloater''' is a whole smoked herring. Both are staples of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British cuisine]].

A typical Dutch delicacy is raw herring (actually enzyme-cured) with raw shredded [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]. To stop parasites, the herring has to be deep-frozen before the curing process.

In Sweden, Baltic herring is fermented to make '''surströmming'''. Herring soup is also a traditional [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]].

In Germany, North Sea herring is pickled to make '''Matjes''', or soused herring.

A '''rollmop''' is a cured herring fillet, rolled up and preserved in vinegar which is flavoured with onions and spices.

'''Pine nuts''' are the edible seeds of pine trees. Commercially, most pine nuts are harvested from the Korean Pine; other important species include the Stone Pine in the Mediterranean area, the Colorado Pinyon and the Single-leaf Pinyon in southwestern North America. Several other species are of lesser importance. They are high in protein, and are also a source of dietary fibre. Pine nuts are considered by many to be an essential component of [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]], and are frequently added to meat, fish, and vegetable dishes. They are also used in chocolates and desserts such as baklava.

Try to go back to the origins of the names for as many common hacking terms; things like hacking, cracking, phreaking, l33t speak and the like.

'''Hackers versus Crackers'''

The quick run-down:

:# most hackers have university level training in computer sciences while crackers are largely untrained in any formal environment - predominately self-taught or peer reviewed.
:# crackers are viewed as pests by hackers while hackers are ignored or mocked by crackers
:# hackers build things while crackers break things (as in security)
:# Phreakers (a.k.a. phreaks), Phreaking - Phone intercepts, phone cracking, gaining control over phone networks.

'''Script Kitties'''

Script Kids, 'kiddies', or &quot;kitties&quot;, use premade scripts in order to do as much damage as possible, these scripts are typically made by crackers so as to expand the amount of damage they do, without having to go to the work of actually cracking machines themselves.  

Data Mining, (Ro)Bots:  Some scripts -'Bots', replicate themselves, seek out specific information or data, copy it, and forward that information to a captive storage space on computers that have been previously taken over by the script kiddies ('owned', or 'Bot'ed', systems).  

Sometimes involved in DataMining (a database search for keywords, email addresses),  the 'bots' can reside in the &quot;background' in a compromised computer, logging keystrokes, or collecting data, and forwarding it, until that computer is thoroughly cleaned of the bots by a knowledgeable technician.

==What is the SAT?==
'''The SAT Reasoning Test''', formerly the SAT I: Reasoning Test, is a college entrance examination administered several times a year by the non-profit College Board.  The exam is used by many colleges and universities in the United States, among other factors, to determine acceptance into undergraduate school.  The SAT is not the only test you can take for college admission, but it is the most widely used.  The other most common test is the ACT.  Interestingly, SAT does not stand for anything (neither does ACT).  If you plan to attend college after graduating from high school, the SAT is one of the most important tests you will ever take.  You should be sure to take it seriously and study hard, using books such as this one.

The SAT is a timed test of approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes, divided into three sections: the '''Math section''', the '''Critical Reading section''', and the '''Writing section''', which includes a written essay.  Each section is graded on a scale of 200-800.  Scaling allows the College Board to correct minor variations in difficulty between versions of the tests.  On the test itself, there are ten sets of questions: three from each section.  Each section has a different time limit; each question has five answers.  One of the Writing section sets is the essay, which is also always Section 1.  One of the sections is known as an equating section and does not count in anyway towards your score; it is used to test new questions and compare the difficulty of different exams.

Until recently, the SAT had only two sections.  The Writing section was added in 2005 and the other two sections were overhauled.  As a result, you now have to use concepts from Algebra 2 in the Math section, but analogies have been removed from Critical Reading.  Collectively, the new test is referred to as the New  SAT.  The maximum possible score on the new test is 2400.  According to the College Board, only 107 students out of 330,000 scored a perfect score on the date of its first administration on March 12, 2005.

==How is the SAT scored?==
The '''SAT is scored''' in a different manner than most tests you are probably used to.  On the SAT, a grading theory is used where the student begins with a raw score of zero.  You earn 1 point for each correct answer, lose 1/4 of a point for each wrong answer, and receive no credit (but also lose no points) for leaving a question blank.  However, note also that there are 10 questions in the math section which require you to provide your own numerical answer; fortunately, no points are deducted for wrong answers on these questions.   The raw score is then converted using a chart developed by the College Board into a scaled score.  Note that although scores under 200 are possible, the College Board cancels all scores which fall into this category.

For the essay, a special method of scoring is used.  The essay is scanned into a computer and transmitted over the internet to approved graders.  Two graders read your essay and give you a score of 0-6.  A zero score is only awarded if your answer is completely off topic.  If the two scores are more than one point apart, a third grader plays tie-breaker.  The two scores are added together (or the third grader's score is doubled) to produce a score in the range of 0-12.  This score is then used in conjunction with your writing multiple-choice raw score to produce the scaled score.

The reason for this method of grading is that the College Board's exam writers understand you are not likely to be able to answer every question on the test.  They also know that guessing on these tests would ruin the accuracy of the scores.  The loss of points for wrong answers is known as the '''guessing penalty'''.

==How do I take the SAT?==
You can '''register for the SAT''' in one of two ways, either via the [http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about.html College Board's website] or by obtaining a mail-in registration form from your high school's counseling center. 

Detailed instructions for registering and other related information are available from either location. Make sure to save a copy of your Admission Ticket and to bring it with you to the testing center, along with a Photo ID. It is recommended that you register online, as this will automatically tie your registration to an online account. About 4 weeks after you take the test, your score will then become available online, and you will be able to easily view it.

There are several options available: You can choose to order the Question and Answer Service, which provides you with your answer to each question, the correct answer, and the question itself, as well as why each answer is the correct one. You may also order the College Board's [http://store.collegeboard.com/productdetail.do?Itemkey=040901252 SAT Online Course]. Other official study guides are available, and their purchase is up to you.

==How do I get my scores?==
'''Scores first become available''' online about 2 weeks after the date on which you took the test.  After about 3 weeks, you will receive a Score Report in the mail, detailing your performance.  If you registered online, you will simply need to log in to your [http://www.collegeboard.com College Board website] account and click View my Scores in the My Organizer pane.  If not, you will need to set up an account.  You will need the SAT registration identification number found on your Admission Ticket, and all other related information.  The website will provide with complete instructions on exactly what to do.

'''Hermits''' are chewy [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]] [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]]. This version is on the strong side of the spectrum so those who prefer less hot-tasting food should hold back on the cloves and ginger.

==Ingredients==

*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (AP)
*⅔ cup seedless [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (a handful more if you like them)
*⅔ cup dark [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], packed
*2½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*½ cup molasses 
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
*2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==

#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|375°F/190°C]].
#Line a sheet pan with parchment paper (a buttered sheet pan works as well but makes cooling and cutting more difficult and more damaging to the sheet pan).
#In a large bowl, stir together flour, raisins, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt until well combined; watch the brown sugar to ensure that it doesn't clump, it will want to do so and brown sugar clumps coated in flour look a lot like raisins coated in flour.
#Stir in molasses, butter, vanilla, and egg until fully integrated. Spread the dough in two strips (approximately 6&quot; by 3&quot;) separated by at least 1½&quot; on the sheet pan.
#Bake for 12 – 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the strips comes out dry.
#Allow to cool slightly then remove the hermits (on their parchment) to cooling racks to cool completely; be sure the bottoms have cooled (just reach under and feel -- if its more than a little warmer than room temperature its not there yet). 
#Move the hermits (still on their parchment) to a counter for portioning and removal from parchment. Cut hermits into 1½ [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] wide strips (a [[Cookbook:Pizza Cutter|pizza cutter]] should work well) then carefully scrape them away from the parchment with a good thin [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]].
#Enjoy with a glass of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:A Nice Cup of Tea|a nice cup of tea]].

Although nice warm these hermits will be even better after a night in an air-tight tin. They should last about a week in that tin though at my house they've never lasted more than a day.

'''Wonton wrappers''' are thin [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]-like wrappers used for wontons. They are suitable for [[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|wonton soup]]. Oversize (7&quot;&amp;nbsp;square) (45cm&amp;nbsp;square) wrappers may be used as [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] wrappers. Round wrappers are best for making [[Cookbook:Potsticker|potstickers]].

Most people will prefer to buy wrappers ready-made. This is especially easy for wontons, because egg roll wrappers may be cut in quarters to make wonton wrappers. Look in a supermarket near the [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] and Asian [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]].

For the stubbornly determined expert cook though, here you go:

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/3-1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] water

==Procedure==
#Sift flour and salt into a large bowl; create a well-like indentation in the center.
#Beat egg lightly, pour into indentation in the flour and mix well.
#Sprinkle with cold water, wet your hands and knead the mixture into a smooth dough.
#Place dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth, refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.
#Sprinkle a wide work area or board with flour. Roll out the dough until it is paper thin and its edges are even in thickness. The wonton skins will be partially transparent.
#Cut dough in 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.5 cm) strips, flour lightly then stack one on top of the other and cut the strips into 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.5 cm) squares.
#Place skins on tray and cover with a damp cloth until ready to use.

==Recipes using wonton wrappers include==
*[[Cookbook:Potsticker|Potsticker (Gyoza)]] (circles are best; hexagons may make sense)
*[[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|Wonton Soup]]
*[[Cookbook:Egg Roll|Egg Roll]] (make 7&quot; (18 cm) squares)

==Introduction to the Math section==
The Math section of the SAT covers several areas: first, it covers general concepts concerning numbers which you are expected to know. Second, it encompasses geometry, especially the properties of angles. Often, parts of the first two are used in coordination with the third area, Algebra. Also, some concepts from Algebra 2, particularly second degree equations, are tested as well.

The Math section contains, in general, around 50 questions. Each question has five answers. However, the Math section is different in that ten of these questions do not have multiple-choice answers. You are required to grid in your answers on these questions. Don't worry- they are similar to the other types of questions; make sure and study the probability portions of Chapter 1. Several different types of answers are allowed on this section.

Although the New SAT contains more straightforward math questions, you must still become used to solving unusual problems involving logic. This logic will build on general rules you can learn in the chapters listed above. The reason is linked to the College Board's philosophy about the test; they see it as more of an aptitude test than an assessment test. In the end, no one can teach you the logic behind the test, but you can study hard, and that will improve your score a lot.

==What is the guessing penalty?==
The '''guessing penalty''', as explained in the Introduction, is the subtraction of 1/4 of a point for each question which you answer incorrectly.  However, the term guessing penalty is misleading.  Consider the following situation: assume that Fred takes the SAT and randomly guesses on five questions.  Because each question has five answers (excluding the ten student response math questions), probability says that he has a 1 in 5 chance of getting each question right.  This means that in the 5 questions, he is likely to get one correct and 4 incorrect.  He will receive 1 point for each correct answer and lose 1/4 points for each incorrect answer.  Quick SAT study question: What will his raw score be?  The answer is zero.  This means that there really ''is no guessing penalty''.  Unless you are very unlucky (or lucky), your net score is unlikely to change noticeably if you guess randomly.

The point of all of this is that guessing is not necessarily harmful to you.  Below, you will learn exactly when to guess.  For now, understand that though the SAT may be graded differently than the way in which you are used to having your tests graded, it does not mean that it is a harder system.  Learn to accept it now and look on the SAT as a challenge, not a necessary evil.

==When should I guess?==
Contrary to popular belief, the idea that you should never guess, is, like the guessing penalty, completely false. '''There is a time to guess''' on the SAT.  On some questions you will not have any idea what the answer is; you are likely on these questions to even be confused as to what it is asking. You should never guess on such a question. You are much more likely to get it wrong in this situation.

However, should you be able to eliminate answers, especially in the Writing and Critical Reading sections, it may be in your best interest to guess.  Before guessing, ask your self a few questions:
#'''What are the chances of getting this question correct?'''  If you can eliminate one or more answers, it is probably a good idea to guess.
#'''How sure am I of the answer?'''  If you cannot make an educated decision about your guess, even if you can eliminate one or more answers, it may be unwise to answer the question. Guessing in the blind is never a good idea.
#'''How hard is the question?'''  Remember, the SAT (with the exception of passage-based reading) is a powered test.  Balance what you know is the probable difficulty level of a question with how sure you are of your guess.

A basic rule of thumb is if you have eliminated at least two answers and are reasonably sure of your guess, then choose an answer and move on. There's no point in worrying about it. Make your best possible choice, take a breath, and get ready for a whole new battle (that is, question).

'''Elimination'''
When it's necessary to eliminate, there are two strategies: You could eliminate answers that are bias. Remember, the test makers are most likely write the test in a neutral way; You could eliminate off-the-wall options. For example, when the problem is asked for the area of a square, there's no way any signs of a pi could appear. Usually, it happens to be the numbers that have big difference with other numbers.

==The Importance of Time==
As in life, the second biggest enemy on the SATs is the clock; the first biggest is yourself. The test requires you to answer a certain amount of questions in a certain amount of time, and thus it is vastly advantageous for you to use your time wisely. Some of these tips are fairly obvious, but it is surprising how many people neglect to do these under the pressure of the moment.
#'''Familiarize yourself with the directions ahead of time.''' You can easily waste more time figuring out how to answer questions than actually answering them. Before you take the test, make sure you know the types of questions you'll face, especially since the information is readily available before you even set foot in the test room.
#'''DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ONE QUESTION!''' That is - DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ONE QUESTION! This has been the downfall of even the cleverest, smartest people. For every challenging, thought-provoking question there are four or five easy, quickly-answered questions following it. The SATs aren't about impressing anyone--they're all about getting points. Get as many as you can.
#'''Budget your time, especially in the first few minutes.''' The more questions you answer in the beginning, the more time you have to chew over more complex problems in the end.
A good strategy (especially on the Math sections, which are much quicker to digest) is to blow through the exam, burning through the easy questions and immediately skipping any question that'll make you think too hard. Then, just keep going through the questions in the next passes. This way, you'll be less likely to dwell on hard problems and you'll at least be guaranteed the easy ones.

==What should I remember on exam day?==
Above all, remember to bring the following list of items:
#'''Your Admission Ticket'''
#'''Valid photo ID'''
#'''Two or more No. 2 sharpened pencils'''
#'''A calculator''', ''preferably a graphing one'' (although you should make sure it is approved for use on the SAT, some graphing calculators (especially ones with a QWERTY keyboard) are not allowed)
#'''A pencil sharpener'''
#'''A snack''' (to be consumed during breaks, not during test time)

Barring these, a good testing day begins long before it actually arrives. Studying, using guides such as this one, is an essential step. Being prepared will boost your self-confidence and improve your score. Start a week before the test and get a lot of sleep. You'll find you do much better. On testing day, after that good night's sleep, make sure you eat a reasonably-sized breakfast. These tips will help give you an edge; remember what one of the first people who took the New SAT said: &quot;It was a test of mental and physical endurance&quot;. At 3 hours and 45 minutes (officially), you will find your brain clogged down. Better to delay the clogging by following these steps than wishing you had when it happens.


Good luck!

The '''Collaboration of the Month''' is an attempt to get Wikibooks regulars and guests who want to help out to work together on a single project over the period of the month.  The hope is that the Wikibook will advance quickly over that period.

* [[Help:Print versions|Creating a print version]]

== Selection criteria ==

Collaborations of the Month are selected by a simple majority vote from books nominated by ''registered Wikibooks editors''.  To become a Collaboration of the Month, a Wikibook must meet the following criteria:

#The Wikibook '''must have its basic project structure already in place'''.  Preferably, it should also have a small, limited, amount of content already available.
#The Wikibook '''must concern a well-known subject'''.  For instance, a Collaboration of the Month could not be over Liquid Crystal Display Dynamics.
#The Wikibook '''must not have been a Collaboration of the Month at any time in the past year'''.

If you believe a Wikibook meets the above criteria and want to nominate it as a Collaboration of the Month, do the following:
#Add {{tl|CoMcandidate}} (see [[Wikibooks:Templates]]) to the top of the discussion page for the main page of the project.
#Click on the link within the template's box which reads '''its nomination sub-section'''.  Then, under the Nominations section on the voting page for the next month type &lt;nowiki&gt;===[[Articlename]]===&lt;/nowiki&gt; and add your reason for nomination below.  Be sure to sign your reason with your signature by adding four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Voting rules ==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

== Proposed rename ==

The pages in this book should be renamed so that they begin with &quot;General Biology/&quot; so that they are consistent with the usual wikibooks style. This would also have benefits for easier navigation and it will be impossible to &quot;lose&quot; a module (as you'd be able to find all modules easily by searching for pages beginning with &quot;General Biology/&quot;. Any move would be done in such a way as to preserve all links. I trust this will prove to be non-controversial, but note it here before proceeding to allow for any comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:58, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Vandalism ==

The image for &quot;How to build a computer&quot; seems to have been vandalised, though when clicking on it the large image is legit - any clues on what is causing this?

== Needs some rework ==

Hi Naryathegreat! I welcome your initiative for focussing collaborative work on wikibooks. This will add a new aspect to the existing projects [[Book of the month]] (which singles out an excellent presentable wikibook on the Main Page) and [[Wikibooks:Top active]] (which shows at a glance on which books wikibookians are actually mostly working). If you want to jump into the crowd and have some fun, choose one of the top ten active wikibooks by contributors. Your project &quot;Collaboration of the month&quot; then aims at bringing a currently not so active wikibook to the attention of writers (hopefully pushing it into the top-10 list for the following month).

Looking at [[Wikibooks:Top active/Listing March 2005 users]], there are at least 35 books on which more people have been working on than on [[General Biology]]. Almost half of those books are related to computers (3D software, programming, user guides), then physics/mathematics, and languages (Japanese, German, Spanish, French), and of course the attractors Cook- and Jokebook. Within those 35 books I don't see any book related at all to Biology. With the same number of contributors (2 logged in users, 6 anonymous users) I see [[Basic Ecology]], [[Organic Chemistry]], and [[Wikijunior Big Cats]] which might be the people possibly interested in working on &quot;General Biology&quot;. So, just looking at this list, one is tempted to say that the user base for the project might be limited.

So there is not much hope to focus content contributors to a book. What could be focussed though is the work on style and presentation of a book. [[General Biology]] is one of the few old books that still uses the bracket &quot;()&quot; delimiters which are clearly outdated and should be replaced by namespace &quot;:&quot; or subpage &quot;/&quot;. Which of those? This question is still [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme|open to discussion]].

Now some technical comments on your implementation:
* I think the procedure to nominate a book is overly complicated and even implemented wrongly: The template [[Template:CoMcandidate]] contains &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}_{{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and will thus point every month to a different position. Should people on the talk page re-enter their reasoning every month again?
* Where should I sign my vote? In the template or directly on the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] page? In case I have to sign in the template, what is the easy way to get there? Why do I have to write &quot;Support&quot;, if &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;# ~~~~&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; could be enough?
* Why am I limited to vote for only 1 candidate at a time? How long is this limit valid - until the book I voted for gets finally voted?
* How long are candidates supposed to stay on the page? Until they are voted? Or is there a mechanism to have books &quot;drop out&quot; of the nomination mechanism again?

I would suggest to get rid of the intermediate template, and ask people to insert their nominations directly on the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] page. (entries for nominated books can then be moved to an archive page).

I also would suggest that if you want to have a serious vote (where people have some choice), you should nominate at least 2 or 3 more books by yourself, to give an impression what kind of books this is thought for.

I also added [[Help:Development stages]] to your list of resources, since assigning them first (before actually editing the book) makes easily visible which chapters are comprehensive and which still deserve work. This focusses both, readers' and writers' attention, to their respective chapters of interest.

Having brought up a lot of critics, let me point out that I indeed welcome this initiative and hope I can contribute in improving this service by constructive criticism. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 09:06, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Follow-up: Nice changes, Narya! I still think the nomination rules are slightly restrictive. I am sure you have in mind that only those people sign who really intend to contribute in the end, but a few points to think about:
# Put the rules into a template - they will appear on each monthly voting page.
# &quot;You may not vote for an article you nominate.&quot; I think this rule is unnecessary. If everybody votes for the book they nominate, each book will have 1 vote more, so the result will not change. Furthermore, the first vote sets an example how and where to vote. (This I miss so far, I would not know where to put my vote: Under the title, or under the comment?)
# &quot;we ask that you vote only once under a single nomination&quot;: I like the idea of being able to vote for several books. On [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] really few people vote for more than a book, even if it is allowed there, but what if I could really think of working on two books? Or if I want to give my second vote just to ensure that another book that will not win can at least be nominated for the next month?
# Renomination with 4 or more votes: Looking at [[Wikibooks:Book of the month]] this is a unrealistically high number! :-) Even if one is allowed to vote for its own book there, books barely reach the 3 vote limit on &quot;Book of the month&quot; - and the vote there is without any commitment for everybody, and everybody is allowed to vote for as many books as they like.
: To attract people I would set up as few rules as necessary at the beginning and try to attract as many voters by simple, easy rules. Once the voters are there and like &quot;Collaboration of the month&quot; you can still start to increase the number, or choose a different system (e.g. &quot;apart from the winner, the three books with most votes will be nominated for the next month&quot;..). But the 3 voter [including nominator!] rule on Wikibooks turned out to be more than sufficient (at least for now). Don't compare with Wikipedia participation (yet).. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:27, 17 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== My support ==

This sounds like a great idea, and I will be happy if we can organize people to get behind one book at a time. Working on these books is a lot more fun and satisfying when done by a team. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 06:40, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Additional requirements needed ==

Here for August 2005, we have a nomination for COTM (1911 wikipedia) that is also at [[WB:VFD]].  Perhaps we need to require that the page must actually clear VFD beforehand. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 4 July 2005 07:50 (UTC)</text>

'''Sociology of the family''' is a branch of sociology studying the construction and role of families, as well as the relations both within the domestic sphere and outward into the work sphere. For this purpose sociologists use a very broad definition of family; one source renders it &quot;an intimate domestic group made up of people related to one another by bonds of blood, sexual mating, or legal ties&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Sociology ([[w:Gordon Marshall|Marshall]], 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Methodology==
Research methods in the sociology of the family can be broken down to three major approaches, each with its own strengths and weaknesses; which need be employed in a study, then, relies largely on the subject of, and questions posed by, the research.

One approach is survey research of contemporary families. This holds the benefit of leaving statistical data and large and hopefully random samples from which a researcher can interpolate the general traits of a society. However, survey respondents tend to answer as would feel regular or ideal rather than as things might actually be. It also gives a very one-sided explanation view of a larger group which does not sufficently allow for contention.

Another method is ethnographic research of families. Where surveys allow for broad but shallow analyses, observation allows sociologists to obtain rich information on a source of a much more limited size. It allows the research an &quot;insider&quot; perspective, and through this closer look a better idea of the actual social framework of families. Where surveys are strong, however, ethnographic research is weak. By reducing the size of a sample size, it may be no longer evident how representative the family being researched is to families at large within a society, and then also does not allow much room in linking the specific traits of the families being observed to a society more generally.

Finally, a researcher can use documented studies of families from the past as a source of information. These sources may include very personal items (such as diaries), legal records (census data, wills, court records), and matters of public record (such as sermons).

==History==
In attempting to explain contemporary society, it is important to look first at the social construction that lead to its development.

===Hunting and Gathering societies===
At an early stage of development societies may practice huntering and gathering. Ideal type characteristics for these societies include:

*Small groups (30-100 people)
*Open, elliptical camps
*Simplistic technology
*Children spaced apart 4-5 years in age (due to low fat diet and regular lactation)

Ideal type characteristics for labor division is as follows:
*Women
**Gather 80% of food supply
**Plant
**Manage distribution of food
**Care for children
**Build/repair shelters
*Men
**Hunt
**Prepare the fields
**Care for children
**Build structures
*Children
**Help to gather food
**Discipline is passive
**Cared for by siblings, parents, and other adults

The general ideology of these groups is typically:
*Egalitarian (no hierarchy of power; men, women, children cooperate)
*Monogamus and bilineal
**Trial marriage
**Divorce not common, nor traumatic
***No wealth to divide
***Children continue to be cared for by multiple adults

Modern governments tend to take issue with nomadic groups, often forcing them to settle in a particular location. This can have various effects on the way of life among these groups:

*Physical context
**Solid permanent structures; doors close off families from one another
**Small scale agriculture and flocks
**Private property
**Wider political and social contact for boys
*Division of labor
**Women and girls
***Preserve and prepare foods
***Begin to be seen as domestic
**Men and boys
***Care for flocks
***Broader social knowledge and ties
***Begin to be seen as public leaders
*Ideology
**Hierarchy
***Stratification by gender
***Stratification by class
**Marriage and divorce
***Become more formalized (parents take control)
***Reinforces class privilege
***Divorce becomes more problematic

'''Sweet Cornbread''' is a variant of the [[Cookbook:Skillet Cornbread | Skillet Cornbread]] made throughout central and eastern Ontario and Quebec and is sometimes known by the alternative name of Johnny Cake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia
  | title = Johnny-cake
  | encyclopedia = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]
  | volume =
  | pages =
  | publisher =
  | year = 1989
  | id =
  | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Its presence in these southern regions of Canada is thought to be due to the influx of British Loyalists from what is now the Southern United States moving to the then-English-controlled colonies during the American War of Independence.

== Ingredients ==

* 256 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 cup) of [[wikipedia:cornmeal|cornmeal]]
* 512 mL (2 cups) of flour
* 8 mL (1 1/2 teaspoons) of baking powder
* 128 mL (1/2 cup) of maple syrup
* 128 mL of brown sugar
* 128 mL of butter
* 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of salt
* 2 eggs

== Procedure ==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the butter.  Soften the butter beforehand if you must by heating it a little.
# The butter/egg mixture should be loose. Add the sugar and maple syrup, mix well, then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Mix the cornmeal and baking powder, then blend them into the liquids.
# Slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper cake batter texture. This should be softer than a cookie dough, able to stick to the mixing spool and come off in blobs.  You may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.
# Pour into a greased pan and put into an oven heated to 200°C (400°F) and let bake for between 15-25 minutes.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* When mixing the batter, be sure it is soft enough for a typical cake; you do not want it too moist or dry.  Use milk to fill in liquid you need and a half-and-half mix of flour and cornmeal if you are too moist.

* Keep a close eye on the cake while it bakes: it will become hard fast if you do not take it out in time.

* If you want to make a crisper crust take a 3 part mix of equal amounts of flour, cornmeal and brown sugar, mix well.  Add to the top of the cake half way into the baking process, but do this very quickly: leaving the door open too long will make your cake a rock.  The amount required varies based on the pan you use, so use your eyes for what you need (less than a cup total).  Despite the call for opening it halfway through baking, adding it at the beginning should work fine as well.

* You can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or plain sugar. Maple is used for its flavouring as much as its sweetness.

* Margarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this. Butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.

* This dish is usually made for after meals and outside them rather than with them, which is how its cousin [[Cookbook:Skillet Cornbread | Skillet Cornbread]] is used.  However, when having [[Cookbook:Maple Beans | Maple Beans]] and Ham, Sweet Cornbread is often served with it.

'''Grannie Gilbert's Sugar Cookies''' are a recipe of sugar cookies running with the Gilbert women of Ontario, Canada for more than 100 years.  No one knows where the recipe started, but it's been that way as long as any can recall with no real change. These cookies are very popular in Ontario and can be found in many bakeries.

==Ingredients==
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (250-375 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 teaspoons (10 g) of [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 cup (200 g) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup (230 g) of [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]/[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]

==Procedure==
# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the shortening.  Soften the butter before hand if you must by heating it a little.
# The shortening/egg mixture should be loose, add the sugar, mix well then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Add the baking powder then slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper doughy state, you may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.
# Make balls and place onto a pan then into an oven heated to 175°C (350°F) and let bake for between 15-20 minutes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Feel free to switch out half the sugar with another sweet item, like honey.
* Using three tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] one can get a slight chocolate flavour to the cookie, without being overtly chocolatey.
* Try adding chocolate chips to it.

'''Pork Tenderloin with Asparagus and Proscuitto'''

== Ingredients ==
* Pork tenderloin (approx 1/2 lb)
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]
* 50g of [[Cookbook:Prosciutto|prosciutto]]
* 175ml [[Cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]] (35% fat)
* 6-10 cloves garlic
* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 2 sun-dried tomatoes
* Approximately 500g linguine
* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 100ml white wine

==Procedure ==
#Trim of small patch of white reticulin. Why? Because that is tough and elastic.
#Dice the shallots and garlic and set them aside. 
#Wash and slice the asparagus into small pieces, using angled cuts for improved presentation. 
#If you wish, you may include a few slices of prosciutto (chopped) to set aside as you may want to include it in the sauce.
#Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (200 C). 
#Place the pork on a clean cutting board. Wrap the tenderloin with the slices of prosciutto, trying to wrap as tightly as possible so it will stay in place. 
#While you are doing this, also preheat an oven-safe pan to medium. Pour a few tablespoons of olive oil into the pan and place the pork inside. Start browning the meat on all sides. Once that is done, place the entire pan into the oven.
#While you are doing this, heat up another pan (preferably a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]) and pour a few tablespoons of olive oil into it. Once it's heated up, toss the garlic and shallots in and sauté them lightly. 
#Once the garlic has been sautéed to a very light brown colour, add a small amount of olive oil and the asparagus. 
#When the asparagus is slightly sautéed, add about 1/2 of the cream and about 1/4 of the wine.
#Fill a medium-sized pot 3/4 full with salted water and set on high heat on a back burner.
#Turn the tenderloin over in the pan, ensuring that the prosciutto does not fall off the meat. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and pepper.
#Reduce the sauce to about half of the original volume, and pour in the rest of the cream and wine. 
#Turn the tenderloin over again.
#Put the linguine in the boiling water and stir occasionally. You may choose to put the chopped prosciutto in at this point.
#Once the sauce has reduced down again, lower the heat and remove the pork from the oven. Place it on a clean cutting board and let it sit for a few minutes. 
#Strain the linguine and start slicing the tenderloin into small medallions. 
#Place the desired amount of linguine on each plate, and place a few medallions on top. Spoon sauce over the top.

Serves 3-4 people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the term &quot;worksheet&quot; currently has a negative connotation in education, putting pencil to paper is still a practical way for students to practice what they have learned.  There are many software programs available that generate worksheets with just a few clicks of a mouse.  These can be customized for any content area, including math.  
===Types of Worksheets===
Types of sheets that can be created range from basic counting to complex algebraic equations.  Depending on the robustness of the program, teachers can input custom information and generate worksheets that are specific to a single aspect of a particular concept. An example of this would be a sheet of multiple digit multiplication problems that allows regrouping only from the hundreds place with all problems having a zero in the tens place of the top factor.
===Benefits===
Another way these customized worksheets can be beneficial is from the perspective of motivation.  Students' names can be used as part of the text for word problems.  Shared experiences can be incorporated into the worksheet to make them more relevant, as well.  Using prices and products from the school store or from a fundraiser are an excellent example of this. Some programs allow the use of graphics.  In addition, because these programs also supply answer sheets, teachers can easily have multiple versions of the same test. Worksheets are maninly beneficial for homework and additional practice or drill. Worksheet generating software can allow a student to focus on a specific skill or object and provide additional practice.

===Special Needs Students===
Textbooks rarely contain enough practice, especially for students with special needs.  With these worksheet generators, teachers have a quick and easy way to provide specific and appropriate practice so students can achieve mastery.

Teachers can also use worksheet generators to create their own lessons and units on subject matter that is not supported by the mainstream publishers.    

For many students with special needs, traditional textbooks and worksheets are designed in such a way that they hinder, rather than enhance learning.  Teachers that understand their students learning styles can design work and study sheets accordingly.  Larger fonts, more white space, and fewer problems are examples of how this might be done.  Keeping the content consistent with the regular education classroom but writing at a lower reading level allows students with special needs to access the curriculum as dictated by NCLB and other laws governing special education.

Hi, I'm a [[Swedish]] learner who usually listen to the [http://www.sr.se/ sveriges radio].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:runny hunny.jpg|thumb|Extracted Honey]]

Honey is often the main desired product of beekeeping, this sweet viscous solution is the result of nectar that has undergone a physical change of having a majority of its moisture evaporated. Where as honeybees are not the only producers of honey, they are the only producers that create an excess that is harvestable.

Honey is mainly used for [[Beekeeping/Food Recipes| cooking]] or for the preparation of food and drink. Traditionally, honey is use as a sweetener in food, and is actually over one and a half times as sweet as standard table sugar. The added sweetness attributed to honey, and the fact that it will have a bouquet of [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey| different flavors]] based on the variety of nectar that was collected to make it, creates quite the attraction to cooks. Honey however is not limited to usage in edibles. Honey can also be used for many [[Beekeeping/Honey Uses |varying applications]] including usage in [[Beekeeping/Mead Making| wine making]], traditional medicine, [[Beekeeping/Cosmetic Formulas |cosmetics]], and allergy relief among [[Beekeeping/Other Hive Product Uses#Honey| other uses]].

| '''Warning''': Honey should not be fed to infants under the age of 1 or to people with sever immune system deficiencies.  This is due to possibility of botulism spores being present. This level of botulism will have no ill effect on a healthy person.

==Forms of Honey==
The majority of people living in an industrialized country have only seen and tasted processed liquid honey. This is an unfortunate occurrence, as processed honey compared to fresh honey from the hive is both bland and unexciting. There exist several common forms of honey that everyone should have the chance to try and enjoy. If one has their own hive, or truly hunts around they would likely be able to find honey in the following forms:
;[[Beekeeping/Extracted Honey|Extracted]]
: Extracted honey is honey in its standard liquid form. Although this category includes processed honey, raw honey is often the desired product. Raw honey is honey that has been extracted from the honeycomb that has not been possessed in any means, except possibly by simple filtration.
;[[Beekeeping/Comb Honey|Comb]]
: Comb honey is capped honey that is still contained within the wax comb created by the bees. It is a traditional favorite eaten wax and all, however it has more recently become difficult to easily find. Before the usage of extraction, nearly all honey came in this form.
;[[Beekeeping/Chunk Honey|Chunk]]
:Chunk honey is a cross between comb honey and extracted honey. Observation shows that it is simply smaller pieces of comb honey suspended in extracted honey. This product is notoriously hard to find in most regions without a local beekeeper.
;[[Beekeeping/Creamed Honey|Creamed]]
:Creamed honey is the generic name for liquid honey which has either has naturally crystallized or induced to crystallize by the addition of dextrose sugar or seed crystals of other crystallized honey. Creamed honey if often used as a spread for toast or bread, the only real difference between it and liquid honey is that it is more so solid and there by less likely to run.

A keen eye may also be able to spot various forms of [[Beekeeping/Adulterated Honey| adulterated honey]], which often refers to a liquid honey that has had something added to it, most often a flavor, chopped nuts, or dried fruit. While conventionally not a standard form of honey, or even a variety, adulterated honey has become a favorite of some, and is worth mentioning.

==Composition==
Honey is a solution composed mainly of sugar and water with a smaller amount of other naturally occurring compounds. The specific composition of particular sample of honey is largely dependant on the nectar source used by the bees that produced it.

==Properties of Honey==
Consisting of mostly sugars suspended in water, honey has several interesting properties that can be exploited.
===Hygroscopic===
Honey is highly hygroscopic, meaning that it will pull moisture from the air and other mediums. Where as it is not advisable to use honey as a desiccant, many bakers incorporate honey into recipes as to keep baked goods moist. In atmospheres with a relative humidity greater than sixty percent, honey will get to work absorbing moisture from the air.

===Fermentation===
Because the moisture content of quality honey is less than seventeen percent, it will resist fermentation by most yeast. If desired, as it is sometimes, honey can be diluted to create [[mead]], but even then osmophilic yeast must be used for proper success.

===Thixotropy===
Some honeys, due to a particular plant protein refined in the nectar of a few plants, show thixotrophic properties. This means that the honey will appear to be in a sold form, akin to [[Beekeeping/Creamed Honey| creamed honey]], but will actually revert to a liquid from when slight agitated. Once the agitation stops it will quickly return to solid. Some honeys that do this include pure [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Grape Fruit| grape fruit]] and pure [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Ling| ling]] honey.
===Granulation===
Give enough time and patience, all [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey| varieties]] of honey will eventually granulate. The speed of granulation is largely dependent on the ratio of fructose to glucose within the honey, the more glucose the quicker granulation will take place. Granulation time can also be decreased by heavy agitation, such as whipping or the inclusion of seed crystals. Honey can be returned to liquid form by applying heat, though granulated honey tastes just as good.

===Antibacterial===
Honey has been show to have certain antibacterial properties, some honeys such as [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Manuka| Manuka honey]] show an even greater antibacterial strength. Because of this property honey was often spread on wounds, especially burns, to promote healing. Due the antibacterial and anti-fermentation properties of honey it is impervious to spoilage when properly kept.

==Quick Honey Facts==
*Honey weighs approximately 12 pounds per gallon  (~1.4 kg/l)
*Honey is about 1.6 times as sweet as white sugar by volume
*Average pH of honey is 3.9
*
*There are about 1380 calories in a pound (12.7 kilojoules per gram) of honey.
*To make just over 11 pounds (5 kg) of honey requires bees to travel a total distance roughly equal to a round trip from earth to the moon.
*[[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Canola| Canola]], [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey #Caster| Caster]] and [[Beekeeping/Varieties of Honey#Golden Rod| Golden Rod]] honey will all crystallize within days of extraction.
*It often takes the equivalent amount of nectar as to make between 7 and 9 pounds of honey, to create one pound of beeswax, or between 7 and 9 kilogramss of honey, to create one kilogram of beeswax.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''arithmetic function''' is a function from the set of positive integers to the set of complex numbers.  Examples of important arithmetic functions include:

The Euler totient function, &amp;phi;(n) defined to be the number of positive integers less than and relatively prime to n

The Mobius function, &lt;math&gt;\mu(n) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if } n \; \mbox{is square free with an even number of prime factors}  \\ -1, &amp; \mbox{if } n \; \mbox{is square free with an odd number of prime factors}  \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e(n) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \mbox{if }n=1 \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The Von Mangoldt function, &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(n) = \begin{cases} \ln p, &amp; \mbox{if }n=p^k \mbox{ for some prime} p \mbox{and} k \ge 1 \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_k(n)=\sum_{d|n} d^k&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\theta_k(n)=n^k&lt;/math&gt;



Many of these functions are multiplicative that is they satisfy a(m)a(n)=a(mn) when m and n are relatively prime.  A function that satisfies a(m)a(n)=a(mn) even when m &amp; n are not relatively prime is called completely multiplicative.  To define a multiplicative function, a(n), it suffices to only give its values when n is the power of a prime; For a completely multiplicative function, giving its values when n is prime uniquely defines the function.

Given 2 arithmetic functions their Dirichlet convolution is defined by 

&lt;math&gt;(a * b)(n) = \sum_{d|n} a(d)b(\frac{n}{d})&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over the divisors, d, of n.  It is easy to show that

&lt;math&gt;(a * e)(n)=a(n)&lt;/math&gt;,

that is the function e(n) is the identity under Dirichlet convolution. Another basic fact is that Dirichlet convolution is commutative and associative.

It is also straightfoward to show that multiplicative functions form a group under Dirichlet convolution, or in other words, the following properties hold in addition to the fact that e(n) is the identity, and its associativity:

* for any multiplicative function a there is a multiplicative function b such that (a * b) = e

and

* the Dirichlet convolution of 2 multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.

The most important fact about the Von Mangoldt function is that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n} \Lambda(n) = \ln n&lt;/math&gt;.

The Mobius function's significance comes from the fact that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d|n} \mu(n) = e(n)&lt;/math&gt;,

and thus if 
&lt;math&gt;f(n)=\sum_{d|n} g(d)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g(n)=\sum_{d|n} f(d) \mu(\frac{n}{d})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Optimizing hints ===

When this program executes, the computer will check all conditions in order until one of them matches its concept of truth. As soon as this occurs, the program will execute the statement immediately following the condition and continue on, without checking any other condition for truth. For this reason, when you are trying to [[Wikipedia:Optimization_%28computer_science%29|optimize]] a program, it is a good idea to sort your if-else conditions in descending [[Probability/Introduction|probability]]. This will ensure that in the most common scenarios, the computer has to do less work, as it will most likely only have to check one or two &quot;branches&quot; before it finds the statement which it should execute. However, when writing programs for the first time, try not to think about this too much lest you find yourself undertaking [[w:Premature_optimization#When_to_optimize|premature optimization]].

Having said all that, you should be aware that an [[w:Optimizing_compiler|optimizing compiler]] might rearrange your ''if statement'' at will when the statement in question is free from [[w:Side-effect_(computer_science)|side effects]]. Among other techniques optimizing compilers might even apply [[w:Jump_table|jump tables]] and [[w:Binary_search|binary searches]].
