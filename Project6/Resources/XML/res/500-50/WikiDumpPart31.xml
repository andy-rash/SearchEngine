      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of decision problems for 1D CA is based on the subset diagram of the de Bruijn diagram. The subset diagram is interpreted as an [[w:finite automaton|finite automaton]] and analysed accordingly. Most decision problems are defined using the larger ''matrix subset diagram'', but they can be redefined using the smaller ''vector subset diagram''.

== The subset diagram ==

Nodes in the subset diagram are all possible preimage matrices or vectors that can be written using boolean elements.

=== Matrix subset diagram ===

The matrix subset diagram is a [[w:Graph (mathematics)|directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;\langle S, Q_D, \delta_D \rangle&lt;/math&gt; later remodeled as a [[w:finite automaton|finite automaton]]. 

&lt;math&gt;Q_D&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all states which are all &lt;math&gt;|Q_D|=2^{k^{2(m-1)}}&lt;/math&gt; distinct bolean preimage matrices. 

:&lt;math&gt; Q_D = \left \{
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \vdots
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \vdots
\end{bmatrix},
\dots,
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots 1 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \vdots
\end{bmatrix}
\right \} &lt;/math&gt;

The set of available cell states &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is used for link labes and as the automaton alphabet. The automaton state transition function &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; defines links between states and their labes.

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_D : Q_D \times S \rightarrow Q_D &lt;/math&gt;

Two transition functions can be constructed, one for the forward direction &lt;math&gt;\delta_{D,f}&lt;/math&gt; and one for the backward direction &lt;math&gt;\delta_{D,b}&lt;/math&gt;. The transitions on input symbols &lt;math&gt;c\in S&lt;/math&gt; are defined by single cell preimage matrices.

:&lt;math&gt; q_{D_{x+1}} = \delta_{D,f}(q_{D_x}, c_x)  \qquad  D_{x+1} = D_x \cdot D(c_x) \quad \mbox{boolean multiplication} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; q_{D_{x-1}} = \delta_{D,b}(q_{D_x}, c_x)  \qquad  D_{x-1}^T = D(c_{x-1}) \cdot D_x^T \quad \mbox{boolean multiplication} &lt;/math&gt;

A finite automaton &lt;math&gt;\langle S, Q_D, q_0, \delta_D, F_D \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is constructed from the graph &lt;math&gt;\langle S, Q_D, \delta_D \rangle&lt;/math&gt; by specifying an initial state &lt;math&gt;q_0 \in Q_D&lt;/math&gt; and the set of final states &lt;math&gt;F_D \subset Q_D&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''empty set'' is the state &lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt; where all preimage matrix elements are 0.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \vdots
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Vector subset diagram ===

The vector subset diagram is a [[w:Graph (mathematics)|directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;\langle S, Q, \delta \rangle&lt;/math&gt; later remodeled as an [[w:finite automaton|finite automaton]]. &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all states which are all &lt;math&gt;|Q|=2^{k^{m-1}}&lt;/math&gt; distinct bolean preimage vectors.

:&lt;math&gt; Q_b = \{ 0, 1, \dots, b, \dots ,|Q|-1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; q = \sum_{o=0}^{k^{m-1}-1} b(o) = 2^{k^{m-1}-1} b(k^{m-1}-1) + \cdots + 2^o b(o) + \cdots + 2 b(1) + b(0) &lt;/math&gt;

The set of available cell states &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is used for link labes and as the automaton alphabet. The automaton state transition function &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; defines links between states and their labes.

:&lt;math&gt; \delta : Q \times S \rightarrow Q &lt;/math&gt;

Two transition functions can be constructed, one for the forward direction &lt;math&gt;\delta_f&lt;/math&gt; and one for the backward direction &lt;math&gt;\delta_b&lt;/math&gt;. The transitions on input symbols &lt;math&gt;c\in S&lt;/math&gt; are defined by single cell preimage matrices.

:&lt;math&gt; q_{x+1} = \delta_f( q_x, c_x)  \qquad  b_{x+1} = b_x \cdot D(c_x) \quad \mbox{boolean multiplication} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; q_{x-1} = \delta_b( q_x, c_x)  \qquad  b_{x-1}^T = D(c_{x-1}) \cdot b_x^T \quad \mbox{boolean multiplication} &lt;/math&gt;

A finite automaton &lt;math&gt;\langle S, Q, q_0, \delta, Q_F \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is constructed from the graph &lt;math&gt;\langle S, Q, \delta \rangle&lt;/math&gt; by specifying an initial state &lt;math&gt;q_0 \in Q&lt;/math&gt; and the set of final states &lt;math&gt;Q_F \subset Q&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''empty set'' is the state &lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt; where none of the overlaps in the preimage vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be used to trace paths.

:&lt;math&gt; b = [ 0, 0, \dots, 0 ] &lt;/math&gt;

The ''full set'' is the state &lt;math&gt;q=2^{k^{m-1}}&lt;/math&gt; where all of the overlaps in the preimage vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be used to trace paths.

:&lt;math&gt; b = [ 1, 1, \dots, 1 ] &lt;/math&gt;

=== Transformations from the matrix subset automaton into the vector subset automaton ===



== Decision Problems ==

To observe a decision problem the subset diagram is transformed into an automaton. A word defined as a string of cells &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is accepted if it connects the specified initial state to one of the final states.

De Bruijn subset diagram, are used to answer [[w:injection|injectivity]] and [[w:surjection|surjectivity]] problems, regular expression for preimages...

=== Surjectivity of CA rules ===

The global transition function is [[w:surjective|surjective]] if each present configuration &lt;math&gt;C^t&lt;/math&gt; has at least one preimage &lt;math&gt;C^{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \forall C^t \; \exists C^{t-1} \; : \; F(C^{t-1})=C^t &lt;/math&gt;

Since preimages are paths in the preimage network, there must always exist at least a single path between the boundaries of any cell string &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Shortest non-accepted string ===
Another problem related to the subset diagram is the shortest string that is not accepted by the subset diagram. This can easily be rephrased as a decision problem: does the subset diagram have a string of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; or shorter for a given integer &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. By the definition of this problem, testing true for a given cellular automaton rule and given &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, the same cellular automaton will test true for ''l''+1. In the case that a cellular automaton is surjective, there will be no such string.

It was alluded to by Wolfram that what Sutner called the 1-permutative cellular automata most likely will test false for the highest &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; within the set of cellular automata with the same number of characters and the same width. Kingsbery proved in his undergraduate thesis that 1-permutative CA will test true for all &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;wk^{w-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the CA's width and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of symbols. Assuming that this is true for all CA (and the work of Wolfram and Sutner seem to indicate that it should be), this ensures that any certificate for this decision problem can be verified in time polynomial to the size of the CA's rule table. It is not known whether such a certificate can be constructed in polynomial time.

'''Theorem:''' 1-permutative CA with a width &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; symbols have a shortest non-accepted string no longer than &lt;math&gt;wk^w-1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:''' TODO

== Definitions and Proofs ==

=== Boolean matrix and vector operations ===

All mathematical addition and multiplications are exchanged with their Boolean counterparts disjunction and conjunction.

Addition become disjunction (logical operator OR):
:&lt;math&gt; x_1 + x_2 \to x_1 \lor x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplication becomes conjunction (logical operator AND):
:&lt;math&gt; x_1 \cdot x_2 \to x_1 \land x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

This basic Boolean operations are than used to define matrix and vector operations.

== Overview ==

A '''''Basilisk''''' — otherwise known as the King of Serpents — is a bright green snake, which can grow to an enormous size. It is a rare, wizard-bred creature, born from a chicken egg hatched beneath a toad; the creation of them is illegal and falls under the Ban on Experimental Breeding. Males are distinguishable from females by the bright red plume on their foreheads. Basilisks have long, poisonous fangs and shed their skin at intervals.

== Extended description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

If someone looks directly into the Basilisk's bulbous yellow eyes, then he or she will die instantly as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning_Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]] did, as mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. If someone looks indirectly (in a reflection, through the lens of a camera), he or she will become Petrified. 
 
A rooster's crow is fatal to Basilisks. Spiders, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantulae]], are terrified of them and flee from them.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], a Basilisk which lives in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] is released periodically by the Heir of Slytherin. The Heir, whose control over the Basilisk is not complete, attempts to guide it to attack students who are [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]]-born. This is apparently an attempt to extend [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]'s preferred policy for admittance into the school. Slytherin, one of the four Founders of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], believed that only the children of wizards ought to be accepted, and departed the school when the other three would not agree with him. Several students of varying parentage and one cat, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs Norris]], are Petrified by the Basilisk. When Harry enters the Chamber and fights the blinded Basilisk, he thrusts a sword into the roof of its mouth, a move that will kill it; in turn, one of its fangs pierces Harry's arm, the poison of which nearly kills him.

== Analysis ==

The monster in the Chamber of Secrets, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] is a Basilisk. The process of discovering this is a slow one, both for the reader and for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters#The Trio|Trio]]. The first clue, which happens barely a week in to the term, is the disembodied voice that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] alone can hear when he is doing his detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]]. In retrospect, it becomes obvious that Harry can understand it because he is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parselmouth|Parselmouth]] and can understand snake language; to Lockhart, and to anyone else in the vicinity, what Harry hears as a voice is only a low hissing and sizzling sort of noise. As the Trio leave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Deathday party, the voice seems to be proceeding upwards between floors without benefit of stairs or anything else; while we have been misled so far into believing that this voice may be coming from something without a physical body, in retrospect again it becomes obvious that the creature is travelling through the pipes. The Petrification of Mrs Norris is another clue, and the dead roosters that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is waving about at the time [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and Nearly Headless Nick are Petrified, is of course a final clue. While much is made in the story of the fact that spiders fear Basilisks, to the point that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] will not speak its name, this may be an addition to the Basilisk legend by the author; as such, it is a clue for the Trio, specifically for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], but not necessarily for the reader.

Basilisks are impossible to control, except by Parselmouths. A Basilisk would be a dangerous servant, as even its master cannot look into its eyes. As such, they do not play much further part in the story; while it's certainly true that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] can control them, even under that control they would prove as dangerous to his allies as to his enemies.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# The one Basilisk that we witness has lived for a thousand years in the Chamber of Secrets, and has apparently become very large. What would it have eaten, locked in the Chamber? How did the animals that it apparently ate, based on the skeletons that Harry found himself walking on, get past the outer door of the Chamber?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The major story arc of the series revolves around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcruxes]], magical items which are not defined until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 23|late in the sixth book]]. At that time, we will learn that it is necessary to destroy [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] Horcruxes before Voldemort himself can be defeated. We also learn that one of the Horcruxes, Tom Riddle's diary, was destroyed by Harry's stabbing it with a Basilisk fang.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 6|Later still]], we learn that in fact Basilisk venom is one of the very few things that can destroy a Horcrux. We learn also that the Sword of Gryffindor had been used to destroy one, the Gaunt ring. This sword, being Goblin-made, will absorb anything that will strengthen it, had apparently absorbed Basilisk venom in the battle against the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, and so now can be used to destroy Horcruxes. It is, in fact, used to destroy two more, Slytherin's locket and Nagini, and Helga Hufflepuff's cup, another Horcrux, is destroyed by the remaining venom in the Basilisk's fangs still lying around in the Chamber of Secrets five years later.

The question of what the Basilisk eats is not entirely idle. We see that the Chamber of Secrets has two doors, the basin in Moaning Myrtle's washroom and the inner door, both of which open on a Parseltongue command. Because the shed skin and the skeletal remains are outside the inner door, we must assume that the Basilisk can open it, and in fact has been, in order to hunt. We must assume that the Chamber cannot be opened from inside by the Basilisk, else it would have been hunting through the school proper for centuries — it was, after all, placed in the Chamber on Salazar Slytherin's departure, possibly a thousand years before Tom Riddle re-opened the Chamber. By the same token, we cannot assume that it has access to the Lake, as if there was a way to reach the Lake, the Basilisk would have likely used it to leave the Chamber for the outside of the Castle and hunt for more interesting game. So, it will have been hunting through the Hogwarts plumbing all those years. Why then has Harry not heard it before? We can only speculate. Perhaps, with the Chamber entrance closed, the pipes it can reach are limited; it is, after all, quite a large snake. We cannot assume that anyone has been feeding it; the Chamber remained closed and hidden for the millennium between Slytherin's departure and Riddle's arrival, and even for a magical being, a thousand years without food is a long time.

== General Overview ==

The '''''Hogwarts Express''''' is a train that travels between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform 9 and Three Quarters]] at King's Cross Station in London, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]], the station for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. It is a special train that carries students to school in September and brings them back to London in June or July.

Pulled by a steam engine, the Express consists of a number of old-style passenger cars with compartments, each compartment holding at most eight people, and closed off from an offset aisle down the length of the car by a sliding door. Normally, Harry and one to five of his friends will share a compartment during the trip. While some British Rail passenger cars of this design had individual doors for each compartment, the Hogwarts Express does not seem to, having two doors to a car and an aisle that runs from one end of the train to the other.

As in most passenger trains, there is a sweets trolley that is pushed the length of the train by a vendor. When he first sees it, Harry is astonished that he does not recognize any of the candy or drinks on the cart, but that does not stop him from buying quantities of Chocolate Frogs, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, and Liquorice Wands, among other things. Given the likelihood of Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] actually making him a lunch, we can expect that Harry will buy lunch off the trolley every trip, but it is only mentioned in the first book.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Apparently, all students headed for Hogwarts are required to use the Hogwarts Express to get there. The physical location of Hogwarts is concealed, and the school itself is &quot;unplottable&quot;, meaning that it cannot be located on a map, magically or otherwise, so the Express may be the only way to locate it. We note, however, that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] have no trouble finding it in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|flying car they have borrowed]], though they do follow the Express in order to find it.

We know that the Express runs at the beginning of the school year, on the first of September, and again at the end of the school year on the day following the school closure. The story seems to be mute on whether it runs again at the beginning and end of the Christmas break, and at the beginning and end of the Easter break. While we see nothing at either of these holidays that suggest the Express was used, it seems unlikely that it would be required for only two of the six common school trips.

It is on the Hogwarts Express in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 6|the first book]] that Harry introduces himself to Ron, and where they meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]], all characters who will play a large role in the story to come. (Harry had met Draco previously, but it is in the train that we learn his name.) The trip back to London in that book is only mentioned in passing.

Harry and Ron are blocked from reaching the Express in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 5|the second book]], but follow it in the flying car to find Hogwarts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 18|The return to London]] in that book is covered only briefly, but it is there that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] reveals that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] has a girlfriend, which is why Percy had prevented what would have been a huge revelation on her part.

The trip to Hogwarts in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 5|the third book]] is actually shared with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]], who spends much of the trip asleep, though he does rouse himself to defend Harry from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]]. His presence also prevents Draco from attempting to jinx Harry. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 22|During the return to London]] in that same book, we hear Hermione planning a course schedule that does not require use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Time-Turner|Time-turner]], Harry receives the letter from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] that lets us know that Sirius has managed to escape, and Ron is given the tiny owl that is soon named [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]].

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 11|In the fourth book]], we overhear Draco in the next compartment talking about a Wizarding school called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], but most of the conversation concerns the just-past [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]]. Draco does visit Harry's compartment to sneer at him and Ron, but as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]], and Neville are also present, he retreats. In that book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 37|the return to London]] is interrupted by Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle bursting into Harry's compartment, telling him that now [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] is back, and he's picked the wrong side. Their attempt to curse the Trio is forestalled by Harry and Hermione, with help from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]]. As they reach London. Harry gives the Twins his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Tournament winnings]] for their nascent joke shop, with the sole condition that they buy Ron some decent formal robes.

Because Harry has been systematically reviled in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] over the summer, he tries, unsuccessfully, to find an unoccupied compartment on the Express [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 10|in his fifth year]]. Harry is dismayed by Ron and Hermione's departure towards the front of the train, where, they say, the Prefects will be meeting in a special compartment. Eventually, he, Ginny, and Neville settle on a compartment with only one other occupant, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]. Here, Neville displays the defensive features of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mimbulus Mimbletonia|plant he has gotten for his birthday]]. The compartment is thus full of stinksap when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] opens the door to say hello. Ron and Hermione return and name the rest of the year's prefects. As seems to be usual, Draco barges in and snipes at Harry, asking how it feels to be second to Ron for a change? Hermione manages to force him out, but she and Harry have noticed that Draco alluded to seeing Sirius at the station.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|The return trip to London this year]] is again punctuated with an attack by Draco and his sidekicks, this time stymied by several members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]]. Some illumination is also cast on romantic affairs at this point, as Harry says that his romance with Cho is over, and Ginny admits to having dumped [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]] in favour of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]].

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 7|Harry's sixth year]], the trip on the Express is quite eventful. Harry has barely settled into his seat when a delegation of girls arrives to ask them to sit with them; suspicious of their motives, he refuses. Hermione points out that Harry, who has grown over the summer, is now quite handsome, quite apart from the change in his reputation from the new slant on stories about him in the ''Daily Prophet''. Harry overhears Draco talking about an assignment he has been given, and attempts to eavesdrop, unsuccessfully. Harry and Neville receive invitations to a gathering being held by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] in his compartment near the head of the train. Finding [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Blaise Zabini|Blaise Zabini]] is another guest there, when the party breaks up, Harry uses his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]] to tail Zabini to the compartment he is sharing with Draco. Draco catches sight of him as he climbs into the luggage rack, but says nothing, and lets nothing slip, until the train has reached Hogsmeade; then he [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|petrifies]] Harry, breaks his nose, and leaves him hidden under his own cloak as the train starts to head back to London. He is rescued at the very last moment by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], who has been posted at the school as a guard.

The sixth book ends before Harry boards the Express to return to London, and as Harry does not attend Hogwarts in the seventh book, the Express is only mentioned in passing, as Ron wonders whether the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] monitoring their hiding place expect them to meekly board the Express on September 1.

== Analysis ==

A key point in the story seems to be that legally the Express is considered an extension of Hogwarts, so use of magic by students on the train is not banned by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]]. While the train is nominally patrolled by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], with almost no exceptions there is no adult supervision. (We note above that Professor Lupin does some minimal supervision late in his journey to the school in the third book, and Professor Slughorn's supervision in the sixth book seems to be restricted to one walk-through as he gives out party invitations, and is thereafter limited to his compartment.)

Much as Platform Nine and Three Quarters represents the transition from the Muggle to the magical worlds, the Express is the place where we re-immerse ourselves in magic, once again getting acclimated to the ready availability of magical abilities. It is critical that magic be unrestricted to allow that acclimation. The lack of adult monitoring is more or less a necessary side effect of the Express being a train; a monitoring adult or prefect can see at most two compartments and the aisle of one car, leaving the vast majority of students out of sight. And as we have seen, magical duels do occur on the Express with no [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] repercussions.

Legally requiring all Hogwarts students to take the Express is a plot contrivance, intended to ensure that interactions between students can occur in relatively unmonitored surroundings. It must be a somewhat awkward contrivance, though, particularly for any residents of Hogsmeade who attend Hogwarts. Despite living almost in the shadow of the castle walls, still the law requires that they travel to London on the first of September, only to be brought all the way back, over the course of an entire day in the Express, to their starting point.

We note that a passenger car of this compartmented design typically would have ten compartments. At 8 students per compartment that gives a capacity of, at most, 80 students per car. With a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry#School population|school population]] of 280, this would mean a minimum of four cars; a school population of 840 would require 11 cars. If we take the larger number and add a luggage van and a brake van, and possibly an additional passenger car, we end up with one engine pulling 14 cars, a large but not extreme number for a single large steam engine. As noted in the Hogwarts article, there is some dispute over the size of the school; we can see here that the requirement that students take the Express to school does not lend significant weight to either side of the dispute.

We note in passing that in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', it is mentioned that there is a special prefects' compartment at the head of the train. We can clearly see that this one must be larger than the standard, because there are twelve prefects. (Ron and Hermione are appointed in their fifth year, and their appointments should continue through for their sixth and seventh years also; two prefects from each House, from each of years five, six, and seven, would imply a total of twelve, including the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Head Boy|Head Boy and Head Girl]].) The Slug Club meeting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 7|on the Express in the sixth book]] only has seven attendees, including Professor Slughorn who may be taking two seats for himself, and so would fit, if only just, into a standard eight-person compartment.

While we have noted that the train is nominally patrolled by Prefects, it also seems that this practice is commonly overlooked by even the most punctilious prefects. Hermione mentions that she and Ron are meant to be patrolling, but then remains in the compartment with Ron and Harry; with the possible exception of Draco's looking in on Harry and sniping at him in years 5 and 6, we never see any prefects on patrol in the Express. Even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], pompous and officious as he is, does not make an appearance in the Express in the first three books, though we could safely expect him to stick his head into Ron's compartment each time he goes by to make sure &quot;his little brother isn't getting into trouble.&quot; It is our impression that this lack of any form of supervision is deliberate on the part of the author &amp;ndash; one last fling of freedom before school starts, enhanced by having no parents, teachers, prefects, or the Ministry hanging over the shoulders of the young wizards.

It is foolish to postulate about an author from her published works, but from the portrayal of the Express we can't help thinking that there is some love of trains in Ms. Rowling's history. It has been suggested by other authors that the Protestant work ethic is involved. On a train, or even more on a ship, even while one is completely relaxed one is still in motion towards their eventual destination. Thus one can be totally idle while still striving for a final goal.

== Overview ==

'''''Cho Chang''''' is a very pretty and charming Ravenclaw seeker and is one year older than Harry. A romance bloomed between Cho and Harry in his fourth (''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'') and fifth (''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'') year, but their relation quickly became strained, and had broken off before the end of his fifth year.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

We first meet Cho when she is introduced as Seeker of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. Harry immediately notices that she is very pretty, and he feels a slight jolt in his stomach when she smiles at him. It also turns out that she is a very skilled flyer; despite the disparity in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|brooms]] (Cho is riding a Comet Two-Sixty, Harry is riding a Firebolt), she is still able to block one of his three attempts to get the Snitch.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Harry sees Cho at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] in passing.

After the announcement of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]], Harry thinks of entering the tournament, winning it, and particularly of Cho's admiring gaze when he does so. 

Cho most seriously wishes Harry luck in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|first Task]] of the tournament.

Harry, upon learning that he will have to find a dance partner for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Yule Ball|Yule Ball]], decides to ask Cho. His fears of looking foolish doing so, however, prevent him actually asking her until the last day of classes, by which time it is too late: she has already promised [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] that she would go with him. She does seem genuinely upset that she wouldn't get a chance to go to the Ball with Harry, though.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], Harry must free hostages that are held by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] at the bottom of the lake. He finds that one of the hostages is Cho, unconscious like the others. Cedric arrives, some time after Harry, and frees her. Harry remains, because he doesn't want to leave anyone down here. When he finally reaches the surface, with Ron and Gabrielle Delacour, Cho is being helped by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]].

Cho's boyfriend, Cedric Diggory, is killed by Voldemort during the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]] of the Triwizard Tournament. At the Leaving Feast, as Dumbledore leads the school in honouring Cedric's memory, Harry sees Cho crying.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Cho looks into Harry's compartment on the Hogwarts Express to say hello to Harry, just after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] has demonstrated the defence mechanism of his new [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mimbulus Mimbletonia|Mimbulus Mimbultonia]] plant. Harry, covered with Stinksap, is mortally embarrassed, and Cho quickly withdraws.

At Hogwarts, Cho approaches Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the courtyard at break, apparently to have a quick word with Harry. Ron sees that she is wearing the badge of a popular Quidditch team, and accuses her of supporting that team only because it is fashionable (we learn much later that Ron's favorite team, the Chudley Cannons, seems to be rather consistently at the bottom of the league). Stung, Cho retorts that she has always supported that team, and leaves.

Following his final session of detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], Harry finds that he has to send a message to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] informing him that his scar hurt again when Umbridge touched him. In the Owlery, he is met by Cho, who has to send a birthday gift. They talk, sharing their revulsion at Umbridge's actions; when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] bursts in, accusing Harry of ordering Dungbombs, Cho defends him. Harry is extremely cheerful thereafter at breakfast, which draws notice from Hermione and Ron.

Harry is pleased again when Cho turns up at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] for the first meeting of what is then called the Defence Association. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Zacharias Smith|Zacharias Smith]] questions his qualifications, Harry is perhaps inordinately pleased that Cho is one of those who leaps to his defence, specifically talking about what he had faced in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task]]. After the meeting breaks up, Cho seems to want to stay behind and talk to Harry, but her friend, who we later learn is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marietta Edgecombe|Marietta Edgecombe]], is impatient enough to leave that she manages to convince Cho to depart.

At the first regular meeting, Cho suggests &quot;Defence Association&quot; as a name for the group, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] points out that the initials could as easily stand for Dumbledore's Army. This name is written on the parchment, and lessons begin. Cho seems to have a great deal of difficulty with simple spells when Harry is nearby, though Harry has noticed that she handles them quite capably when he is on the other side of the room.

At the last D.A. class before Christmas break, Cho lingers after the rest of the students have left. She and Harry talk, she is still wondering about how Cedric died. Harry is unable to give much reassurance. She maneuvers Harry under the mistletoe, and they kiss.

Afterwards, talking with Hermione, Harry describes the kiss as &quot;wet. Because she had been crying.&quot; Hermione says she does that all the time because she is still so confused about her own feelings for Harry and about Cedric. When Harry describes his efforts to console Cho, Hermione says it could have been worse. Hermione asks if he's going to see her again; Harry does not answer – the idea that he could go out with Cho seems to take him by surprise.

Back at the school after Christmas, he meets Cho in the Entrance Hall. She points out that the next [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] weekend falls on February 14. When Harry realizes what she is talking about, he invites her to go to Hogsmeade with him; she enthusiastically accepts.

Once in Hogsmeade, though, Harry feels very out of place. Cho suggests Madam Puddifoot's Tearoom, and Harry agrees, but finds it full of Valentine's Day decorations, and packed solid with couples kissing. Harry, feeling awkward, casts around for topics of conversation but comes up with nothing. When Cho mentions that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Roger Davies|Roger Davies]] had asked her out, but she had turned him down, Harry is uncertain how to respond, not least because Roger, entwined in another girl, is sitting directly behind him. Harry has promised that he will meet Hermione at the Three Broomsticks at noon, and tells Cho this; Cho misunderstands, and storms out. Hermione, discussing this with Harry later, says that he should have expressed reluctance, that he really thought Hermione was ugly but that he had promised to meet her. Harry is somewhat appalled at the thought of such duplicity.

What Hermione has arranged is that an interview with Harry, written straight instead of being slanted to make him out to be an attention-seeker, will be published in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|The Quibbler]]. When the interview comes out two weeks later, Harry is greatly cheered that Cho seeks him out, and tells him that he was really brave to give that interview.

Shortly after this, the D.A. is betrayed by Cho's friend Marietta Edgecombe. When Cho meets Harry after this, she says that she is sorry about the betrayal, but then goes on to defend Marietta, saying that her mother works in the Ministry. Harry points out that Ron's father works in the Ministry as well, but Ron doesn't have the word &quot;Sneak&quot; written on his face. Cho says that it was a dirty trick to charm the parchment they had signed that way, but Harry is adamant: there was no reason to betray the D.A. Cho storms off.

Harry, having seen a very disturbing scene that passed between his father and Snape, is preoccupied; luckily, he can pass off his preoccupation as being the result of fighting with Cho.

Though Cho is playing in the final Quidditch match of the year, against Gryffindor, Harry is extremely ambivalent about watching her. He thinks to himself that he doesn't know what he wants, except that he doesn't want any more fights. When her name is announced and he sees her on the field, his stomach does not do its usual backflip, only more of a feeble lurch. Even seeing her talking animatedly with Roger Davies gets very little reaction.

On the Hogwarts Express heading back to London, Cho walks past Harry's compartment, blushes, but doesn't stop. Ginny says that she has taken up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Michael Corner|Michael Corner]]. Ron asks, hadn't Ginny been going out with Michael? Ginny says that he was a poor loser, so she had dumped him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] === 

Cho passes Harry a few times, but there is no real interaction.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

In the preliminary action before the second Battle at Hogwarts, Cho appears with the other members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] to help defend the school against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. She volunteers to show Harry the bust of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]] in the Ravenclaw common room. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] forestalls this, suggesting quite strongly that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] should do that instead.

== Strengths ==

An excellent Quidditch player. Cho was also a member of Dumbledores Army (DA) with Harry. As a member of Dumbledore's Army, she was strong enough magically to progress to the point of actually conjuring a corporeal [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]]. In Harry's OWL exam that same year, his ability to conjure a corporeal Patronus was evidently worth an extra mark; while other members of the DA were apparently not similarly tested, the fact that this was worth a whole letter-grade (about 10% of the examination total) would indicate that it is a relatively rare ability for a fifth-year, and presumably also for a sixth-year.

== Weaknesses ==

She does not seem to be able to complete her mourning for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], who is killed at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. Throughout the next book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], other characters are commenting on how much crying she is doing.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

While she seems to be friends with a lot of other Ravenclaw students, the main relationships presented are her and Harry dating 'on and off' after her former boyfriend, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] was killed, and her defence of the actions of her friend Marietta Edgecombe. Cho's romantic relationships are covered in more detail [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cho Chang|here]].

{{Gothic alphabet}}

There are pronouns in Gothic for all four grammatical cases in all three persons. The first two persons have different forms for all three numbers (singular, dual and plural). The third person has different forms for all three genders (feminine, masculine and neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural).

For mixed groups of masculine and feminine things or people, use the masculine plural pronouns.

David,

First of all, I want to thank you for coming to Wikibooks and publishing original content here.  I added a longer and more detailed explaination about what should happen to this Wikibook you have been working on.  Keep in mind that by publishing on Wikibooks you are asking for other people to come and change the content... potentially to something very different from what you originally intended to write.  If you don't mind that happening with what you have left here, Wikibooks is the best forum for you to try and exchange your ideas.  While not apparent from just poking around on a few pages, contributing to Wikibooks is a very social experience and you will get to meet people with a very wide variety of opinions, backgrounds, and philosophies.

Thank you also for introducing a theological Wikibook to this project.  Of just about any subject, this is one that can be incredibly controversial.  Keep in mind that what we (other active contributors) are trying to do is raise the standards of this project to give more credibility to what we are doing here.

With whatever happens, don't take criticisms about your book personally.  We really do apreciate all attempts to add content to this project, and you have certainly added a real series of books here.  It is my objective to help you out and make these books successful.  I see that you have end notes to each chapter, and perhaps some of the casual readers are not aware of the citations you are using to back up your claims.  The NPOV (''Neutral Point of View'') is perhaps one of the hardest things to learn how to write here on any Wikimedia project, particularly if you have written with a strong POV in the past.  Vent your ideas on the discussion pages, and give an idea for where you are going with a particular module.  Discussion pages also tend to have a stronger POV on them although I have seen some very successful content be very well written as a result of trying to mesh together various points of view into something more universal.... which seems to be the point of your book anyway.

Again, thanks for being on Wikibooks, and I hope that you are willing to contribute to other worthwhile projects as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:46, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

Rob:

Thank you for your nice comments. I do understand that anyone can edit and change what I have written. I very much like this idea and hope that editing can improve what has been written. I don’t even mind if the consensus is to completely change the book’s focus: if that is what people of the world think is best, then it is OK with me.

But, if the vote is to delete the last part (Developing A Universal Religion), could I offer to send a [free] email copy to anyone requesting it? (And, again, letting the majority make the decision about the legitimacy of making such an offer.) [[User:David Hockey|David H]] 14:52, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

P.S. I don’t know if replying in my User Talk is the best way to reply to you, so I’ll send a copy of this to your email address. David

== Candidates for speedy deletion ==

I removed speedy deletion notice, I thing it was a mistake from me. Poeple should decide about this book at VFD. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:08, 14 November 2005 (UTC)


Thanks, Derbeth. David

[[User:David Hockey|David H]] 22:17, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== Criticism ==

I've started reading your book.  It's interesting as far as I have read but slightly marred by what seem to be some slightly careless statements regarding world opinion and world resources.  I've added notes to the talk pages of the pages I read, [[Developing A Universal Religion/1. Why Bother?/3. Why Do Anything?]], [[Developing A Universal Religion/1. Why Bother?/1. Why Develop A Universal Purpose?]].  I'm using the word criticism in its most neutral meaning here.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 22:03, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Orphaned pages ==

You can always mark page for deletion: just insert {{tl|delete}} template. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:24, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

== Please comment ==

Please comment on a book of yours at VfD. See [[Thinking And Moral Problems]], [[Religions And Their Source]], [[Purpose]], and [[Developing A Universal Religion]]. Thanks --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:40, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

*Thanks for the email, LV. I have noted what I think on the VfD. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 15:07, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

== What is this about, please? ==

THe following was added to my user page, but I do not understand why, or what it means. So I have moved it here. Can someone tell me why it was put on my user page, please. (Worse, they used my name and entered it as though it were me entering it!) [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 20:49, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

: It must have been a stupid joke or something. In future, just delete such text. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:27, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

:: Ok. Thanks. But is anyone able to enter revisions using my signature/name? [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 15:39, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

== Major rewrite proposed ==

I was reading some of you work on consciousness, in particular [[Thinking And Moral Problems/3. Making Decisions/2. Moral Decisions|Moral Decisions]]. Although I agree on many positions you've advocated, you seem to have missed the boat on this page. Do you have any basis for asserting that the non-religious (whether subconsciously or consciously) adopt a random metaphysical purpose to live by? I don't think that sounds plausible, and contradicts much of contemporary thinking (at least so far as I'm aware). I've proposed a re-write on the talk page - it's not terribly detailed, but I've outlined some of the positions I'd be advocating, and the sources I may use. Please comment on my interpretation of what you've written, and your thoughts on the changed I'd like to make. I plan on reading thought the sections concerning neuroscience in more detail and making changes there as well. ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:18, 15 September 2007 (UTC)

: Hello Mike.

:Moral problems and practical problems are both, simply, problems. (With moral problems being defined by the mind of an individual, whereas practical problems are defined by the environment outside of the individual.)

:To solve any problem “satisfactorily” the solution must achieve the purpose sought. Thus, to send people to Mars, all the practical problems that reality (i.e., the universe) confronts us with have to be solved. And each of these smaller practical problems will have a purpose to be accomplished. I.e., all practical problems are solved by accomplishing/achieving a purpose.

:Surely “moral” problems must be solved in a similar fashion? Are there any “moral” problems that are solved by not meeting a purpose?

:But, if the solution to a practical problem is to be “satisfactory,” then it must work within the confines of reality—the universe.

:However, the solution of a “moral” problem is “satisfactory” (to the individual posing the moral problem) if it works within the confines of the individual’s mind. That individual correctly states that he/she has solved the moral problem (whereas others might agree or disagree, depending upon what they think in their minds).

:Thus, I do not think that there can be a Universal Morality.


::“Do you have any basis for asserting that the non-religious (whether subconsciously or consciously) adopt a random metaphysical purpose to live by?”

: No, I don’t think that a “random metaphysical purpose” would be much use to anyone!

: But I do think that a carefully worded metaphysical purpose is needed if a global civilization is to survive. I try to give reasons for asserting this in Part Four: Developing a Universal Religion.

:[[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 19:33, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

::Well, you certainly seem to make the case for that conclusion rather concisely - that people with no religion must adopt &quot;some&quot; (read: &quot;any&quot; or &quot;any random&quot;) purpose by which to live. If that's not what you meant, I suggest you rewrite it yourself, since that's how it comes off.
::Surprisingly, your comments above seem to be implying a sort of moral relativism: &quot;If it's OK in your own mind than that's all that matters.&quot; Well, I don't think that's true, and neither would anyone who ''seriously'' understands morality. Eichmann may not have been an antisemite, but we still hung him - and with good reason.
::I may simply start a book on moral philosophy instead of rewriting that section of your book. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:56, 25 September 2007 (UTC)


:::No, Mike, I do not think that people must adopt a purpose by which to live. I am sure that most people do not do this.

:::But I do contend that moral decisions must be solved in the same way that practical decisions are solved. Of course, their “environment” differs (that’s why we try to solve them in different ways.)

:::And I do think that, if one wants a “satisfactory” solution to any problem, moral or practical, then some “satisfactory” result must be obtained. It is this desired result that constitutes the “purpose” one must have.   [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:07, 25 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why do humans have beliefs and religions? The answer, “to help us solve moral problems and make moral decisions,” only introduces other questions. Why do we have moral problems anyway? Clearly, everyday living requires us to solve many practical problems, but where do moral problems come from?

To understand why humans need beliefs and religions we must first investigate how we think—particularly how we solve practical problems and make practical decisions. Understanding these matters explains why solving abstract problems of morality requires us to invoke beliefs and construct religions. And this, in turn, equips us to examine, with some impartiality, the religions we now employ (we attempt to do this in Part Two, ''Religions And Their Source'').

[[../Thinking/]], tackles the first task. It discusses the brain, moves to the idea of a mind, and ends by exploring what we usually mean when we say we are thinking. We will find that a great deal of our thinking has to do with solving problems.

[[../Solving Problems/]], shows that all problems originate in, and are structured by, the various environments that we inhabit; practical problems devolve from the practical environment, social problems from the social environment, and so on. But moral problems, issues of “right” or “wrong,” originate entirely within our minds, and it is the mind’s lack of an environment (other than the one each of us constructs—more about this in Part Two, ''Religions And Their Source'') that makes these difficult to solve.

[[../Making Decisions/]], discusses decision-making. It points out that the desire to attain a purpose is basic to making any decision, be it practical or moral. Moral judgements are metaphysical judgements, so we must have some metaphysical purpose in mind (and also want to attain it) before we can make moral decisions. Religions provide such purposes. They also provide various metaphysical environments; these create and structure our moral problems, as we shall see.

In short, this part of the book demonstrates that we cannot solve moral problems or make moral decisions without valuing the attainment of some kind of purpose (which can be spiritual or secular). We do not do this because there is (or is not) a god. We do not do this because we follow a religion. We do this, as we will shortly discover, because we try to think rationally when solving important problems and when making important decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A discussion about thinking must begin by saying a little about the brain and the mind. The first exists in concrete form: it is pinkish-grey in colour, weighs about three pounds, and has the consistency of jelly. It contains about a hundred billion neural cells supported within some trillion neuroglial cells, consumes about twenty percent of the body’s energy, and can be dissected and examined microscopically. But the mind is quite a different kettle of fish. In fact, some neuroscientists deny its very existence. They prefer the simpler explanation that thoughts occur in the brain, and claim that what we call the “mind” does not exist. However, it is simpler to discuss the two separately, and this is how they will be treated in this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The brain evolved in animals because there is a strategic advantage in being able to detect and capture food (as in say a mollusc) and later to search and find food and sexual partners. The brain is thus a mechanism for locomotion and for avoiding hazards. 

The brain’s chief job therefore is to store and operate the controls that command many inherited (or instinctive) body functions. This section discusses a little of what happens during this process, so that the difference between what the brain does and what is involved when thinking can be made clearer.

Instinctive behaviours are transmitted from one generation to the next through gene codings, as has been demonstrated many times. For instance, fruit flies normally wake up with daylight, nap in the afternoon, then fall asleep at dusk. This behaviour is controlled by a gene, the so-called “period gene.” If this gene is removed from male and female flies which then mate, their descendants sleep at random times. If the gene is then returned to these time-less progeny, they and their offspring will resume regular sleep patterns. 

The first, tiny part of this instinctive behaviour started as the result of a mutation&lt;ref&gt;Breaks in the DNA strands of a sperm, ovum or zygote (caused by such factors as carcinogens, naturally occurring free-radical oxidation within cells, energetic electromagnetic radiation such as ultra-violet and X-rays, radon gas, and so on) are, to a large extent, repaired. The few that may not be repaired (or are incorrectly rebuilt) are called mutations; these become reproduced, as are all DNA molecules, in all of the cells formed from the zygote&amp;mdash;including those of future generations. Since DNA controls cell formation and growth by affecting protein synthesis and the sequence in which sets of genes are turned on, these mutations can have various wide-ranging effects, from insignificant to fatal.&lt;/ref&gt; eons ago that caused one fly to sleep during the dark, with the concomitant reduced danger of being eaten compared to flies that were sleeping during the day. Surviving and passing this mutation to its descendants, this fly became the progenitor of successive generations that also fell asleep at dusk, so surviving in greater numbers than those lacking this&lt;ref&gt;A later different mutation in the same gene caused a fly to nap in the heat of the afternoon, which must also have contributed to that fly’s survival, and to the survival of many descendants, for this behaviour has also become inherited by the majority of fruit flies.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jonathan Weiner provides an example&lt;ref&gt;Read Jonathan Weiner, ''Time, Love, Memory'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1999) for an eloquent description of some of the experiments with fruit flies and mice that proved that instinctive behaviour can be genetically inherited.&lt;/ref&gt; that nicely illustrates the value of instinctive behaviour in animals larger than fruit flies. He describes an experiment that uses a blackened piece of cardboard or wood cut into a bird-like shape. When this shape is moved in one direction across a light sky or ceiling it appears to be the silhouette of a goose flying; if it is moved in the other direction it resembles a hawk. When newly hatched goslings, raised in an incubator and having had no contact whatsoever with any adult goose, are shown the cut-out moving in the goose-resembling direction, they pay no attention. When the same cut-out is moved in the opposite direction, they scatter and attempt to hide.

Instinctive behaviours, like all others, depend upon the brain recognizing the significance of signals received from body sensors, or from the presence or absence of chemicals in body fluids. The question slowly being answered&lt;ref&gt;The use of computers and a variety of instruments has greatly expanded our knowledge of the brain in the past few decades. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed, thin, cross-sectional images. (This technology, which uses high frequency radio waves and strong magnetic fields, can also detect chemical changes that occur in the brain during various behaviours.) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) maps changes in oxygen concentration and shows localized neural activity. (For instance, an analysis of fMRI patterns can tell researchers, to an 85% accuracy, which particular picture, from a selection of several different pictures, subjects were viewing while being scanned.) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), using radioactive tracer chemicals, shows the formation of neurotransmitters as signals disseminate from neuron to neuron. Electroencephalography (EEG) and minute wire probes detect chemical and electrical changes occurring within single neurons. Voltage sensitive dyes show groups of neurons lighting up in sequence following sensory stimulation. Advanced Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanners show that visual recognition and decision making processes within the brain move from the visual cortex, through memory and speech (i.e., sub-vocalization) regions, to the right parietal cortex, where decisions are consciously made.
New ways of investigating the brain’s functioning are continually being introduced, and undoubtedly our understanding of what is occurring will grow rapidly over the next few years. (MEG scanners, which use an array of super-conducting quantum interference devices bathed in liquid helium, are one such recent introduction.)&lt;/ref&gt; is, “how does the brain know what to do when it receives such signals?” Neurons in the brain (Hercule Poirot’s “little grey cells”) hold the answer.

Most human neural cells (neurons) resemble minute, spiky blobs with tails. The blob, or body, is called the soma. The tail, a long, thin, branching, tube-like extension, is called the axon. The hundreds of short, spiky structures fringing the soma are called dendrites. When activated, electrical signals in the form of electrically charged chemical ions travel from the dendrites, through the soma, along the axon and its branches (the fanout&lt;ref&gt;Axon fanouts can have between one and ten thousand branches.&lt;/ref&gt;), to a number of bubble-like terminating vesicles. Ions arriving at the vesicles cause the discharge of neurotransmitter chemicals into the minute gaps that separate one neuron from another. These chemicals are detected by so-called synaptic knobs on dendrites belonging to neighbouring neurons, where they may start new ion flows within receptive neurons.

Neural networks store information for later use. This is done in a two-step process. First, flows of chemical ions circulating in tiny closed networks of neurons hold data temporarily. Much information from eyes, ears and other sense organs is temporarily stored in such neural loops while being screened for significance. Since the majority of incoming information is of little interest, most of it is discarded. (Cutting off the energizing nutrients prevents the loops from becoming significant.) Second, information having a relationship to other pre-stored or incoming data that is deemed significant can be kept active by constantly re-energizing the loops. This induces the growth of synaptic knobs on dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;Synapses have been photographed growing in rats following stimulation of the optic nerve. New knobs take about an hour to grow.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional synaptic knobs facilitate the transmission of neurochemicals across the dendritic gaps and thus build pathways of lowered electro-chemical resistance connecting one neuron to another. These pathways form neural networks that can retain the bytes of information that induced their formation for many years. Millions and millions of neural networks, each storing tiny bits of information, are to be found within everyone’s brain (most laid down during our first few years of life).&lt;ref&gt;The development of the brain from its simplest beginnings to its current complexity in human beings is ably discussed by John Morgan Allman in ''Evolving Brains'' (New York: Scientific American Library, 1999).
See also John H. Holland, ''Emergence: from Chaos to Order'' (Reading, Massachusetts: Helix Books, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., 1998). Larry R. Squire and Eric R. Kandel, ''Memory: From Mind to Molecules'' (New York: Scientific American Library, 1999) provide a different perspective.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain analyzes and interprets information coming from the senses&lt;ref&gt;Neurons transmit data from body sensors to the brain, and from the brain to body muscles, as well as within the brain itself.&lt;/ref&gt; by routing it through earlier-formed neural networks. These respond (think “resonate”) to the presence of specific, tiny, chunks of information that match the chunks that earlier caused the network to form. This can be illustrated by electronically tracing what happens to information received by the eye, a well-explored example that helps us to understand what the brain does with data from other body sense organs. Light, reflected from the object we are looking at, enters the eye and falls upon the light-sensitive rods and cones in the eye’s retina. This creates millions of tiny signals, and these travel along the optic nerve to the brain. Key aspects of the component signal, such as information bytes denoting vertical edges, excite existing neural patterns (i.e., tiny memories) of the kinds of objects that have vertical edges. The same “analysis” is done for horizontal edges, relative sizes, colours, shapes (for instance, the vertices of any triangular aspects the object may possess), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Studies have shown that stimuli from the retina move successively through the lateral gemiculate nuclei (which respond to changes of brightness or colour), to the primary visual cortex (which can detect motion and its direction), then on to well over twenty other cortical regions (which detect shapes), and eventually on to more specialized regions such as the inferior temporal cortex (which can recognize objects and identify their form).
The sequential detection of optical stimulation shows how vision has evolved over time to become what it is today. Many hundreds of millions of years ago one or more genetic mutations occurred, producing a slight cellular sensitivity to light. Helping the entity to survive, the altered genes were passed on to descendants. Subsequent mutations, perhaps forming several light-sensitive patches, and probably occurring many generations later, gave additional survival benefits, and these were also passed on. Gradually, after many thousands of genetic modifications (the majority of which would not have helped survival, and whose possessors would not have had a greater chance of surviving to reproduce), primitive eyes and the associated decoding memory networks in the brain, would exist. All organisms’ body tissues and systems have been constructed in this manner, with non-lethal modifications being passed to descendants as additions to those already present.&lt;/ref&gt; This process continues until the brain excites a pattern that matches stored patterns of objects similar to the one being viewed and the object is “recognized.” “Recognition” is complete when additional characteristics, retrieved from other neural networks storing “memories,” can be added.&lt;ref&gt;One of these memories would likely be its name, for animals having language abilities. See section three of this chapter for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memories of objects and events are built up by a reverse process. Early in life, a toddler, staring at a fir tree, for example, would have stored information in his or her brain about its general shape, colour, branch pattern, leaf shape and other characteristics. Each aspect would have been broken into smaller bytes, temporarily then permanently stored and linked by neural pathways to other related bytes (including, but added much later, bytes representing the name of the tree). If more fir trees were noted, neurotransmitting chemicals would continue to induce the formation of synaptic knobs linking  and reinforcing stored memories of tree parts and whole trees. Eventually, neural networks storing relatively detailed memories of fir trees would be built. Information received upon seeing a maple tree, having many similar features, would connect into many of the same neural patterns used by the fir tree memory, but would, of course, connect into other quite different ones. (At least, it would for those who had learned the difference between a fir and a maple. Those who had not discovered the similarities and differences would have to make do with a generic tree-memory.)

Whether or not any of this knowledge affects survival would be a matter of circumstance, but it is clear that memories built up through experience do greatly affect what we know,&lt;ref&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is able to show brain activity when mental tasks are performed. When a subject is shown pictures of places visited, memories of those places cause particular brain areas to activate. Pictures of places not visited do not elicit such a response. The techniques which detect this mental behaviour can be used to examine people suspected of taking part in criminal activities. This creates an interesting moral problem: should such a technology be developed? See Brad Evenson, “The guilty mind,” ''National Post'', February 8, 2003, A1 and A6.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as what we come to believe and how we behave. Much more about this later.

Information that depicts frequently seen objects travels along, and reinforces, the same neural pathways, making them evident by the thousands of synaptic knobs (as many as 10,000 or more) that form on the dendrites of neurons along these routes. Such large numbers of synaptic links vastly increase the brain’s sensitivity to similar stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;Brains of rats raised in stimulating environments possess many more synaptic knobs, are heavier, and have a better blood supply than the brains of rats raised in uninteresting conditions. See Susan Greenfield, ''The Private Life of the Brain: Emotions, Consciousness, and the Secret of the Self'' (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2000). Rats (and mice) raised in enriched environments also learn better. See page 42 of “New nerve cells for the adult brain,” in ''The Hidden Mind'', a special edition of the ''Scientific American'', May 2002, 38-44.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby decreasing response time—an important survival feature in potentially dangerous environments. Conversely, seldom-seen objects take more mental effort and may be only slowly recognized. Because our brains can carry out many unconscious functions simultaneously, we experience signal analysis and recognition as though it happens instantaneously. However, information flow along neural axons and across synaptic gaps is slow compared to information flow in computers.

Of course, recognizing the significance of incoming stimuli involves a lot more than described above. To better appreciate how information from our senses is used within our brains, consider what must be happening if, for example, we suddenly notice that we are about to walk into the branch of a tree. Before the brain can induce any action, it must, at the very least, understand the following. First, it must understand the nature of the tree’s relationship to us (e.g., that the tree will do nothing to us if we do not bump into it). Second, the brain—as well as the mind—must have access to, and be able to use, memories of what actions have succeeded in the past (e.g., that we can avoid trouble by simply ducking our head or by stepping sideways). Third, the brain needs to be constantly aware of the body’s abilities and limitations (e.g., it must know that we can’t jump out of the way if, for example, we walk with a cane). All these things, and many more, must be known to the brain just so that it can cause the body to act in a suitable manner.

It is important to note that most of what has been described above is not thinking, for even simple life forms perform many of the same functions. They react to stimuli, and show evidence of possessing memories by using the information stored in these memories when reacting. Amoebae move away from acidic areas. Earthworms sense the void of large holes in the ground and move around them. Spiders feel their web trembling and emerge to envelop prey, and so on. All living entities respond to changes in their environment by sensing stimuli of one kind or another, then acting upon what these stimuli represent to them.&lt;ref&gt;Plants also do this; for instance, gravity orients stem growth upwards, roots develop toward nutrients, and branches shape so that their leaves gather maximum sunlight.&lt;/ref&gt; These sensing, analyzing and danger-avoiding activities are continually being carried out, even by primitive animals. Advanced animals have inherited these same abilities, most of which occur within the brain. But almost all of these are programmed activities which take place without any thought.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Calvin, in ''The Ascent of Mind: Ice Age Climates and the Evolution of Intelligence'' (Bantam Books, 1990) discusses this topic in a straight-forward manner. He explains reflex actions as due to “sensory schemas” being firmly linked to “movement programs” (see page 39 of his book). Computers can be programmed to carry out similar functions, i.e., to oversee and care for the well-being of machines, vehicles and factories. Although many expect computers to eventually be able to think, these care-giving electronic chips certainly do not.
The parallels between the human brain and a computer have been interestingly developed in Chapter Seven, “The Evolution of Consciousness,” of Daniel C. Dennett’s book, ''Consciousness Explained'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; They form what may be considered to be a lower level of neural functioning. Although collecting, storing and recognizing signals are important and necessary functions significant to thinking (just as buying and storing tools and materials are important functions in a factory’s operation), they are not “thinking” per se. They are simply operations that trigger the release of action-inducing chemicals. In as much, these functions are similar to many others that support and maintain the body’s welfare. [[../First- And Second-Level Thinking/]] clarifies this distinction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The human mind is that part of the brain that is able to imagine, and exists mostly in the forebrain. That is why the foreheads of modern people do not slope backwards as in other primates. This forebrain was probably previously the organ of smell, which for our species uniquely, has evolved in a truly remarkable way. Imagination and communication are so closely related that it is reasonable to aver that the principal purpose of language is really to tell lies!

We will have much to say about the mind, memories and thinking, so these terms should first be defined. It is reasonable, for our purposes, to say that the myriad of neural networks of stored information that we call memories, when considered together, form what we might call a “quiescent” mind—a mind that is ready to handle information, but is not actually doing so. (A person with such a mind would be called “brain dead,” and the kind and amount of information that such a “mind” might be reactivated to handle would vary greatly with circumstances.) An “active” mind would be one where chemical ion flows are carrying information from place to place. All living minds are constantly active.

The term “memories” includes all of an individual’s mentally stored facts, theories, opinions, personal experiences, recallable emotions, past thoughts, ideas, etc. “Thinking,” for most of our purposes, can be defined as the act of seeking relationships between these memories, or between memories and current stimulations being received from body sensors. (What occurs during thinking is examined more thoroughly in the next section.)

Animal behaviour studies suggest that many animals possess rudimentary thinking abilities. Tool making is considered to be evidence of the ability to think and many creatures make and use tools. Racoons pick up and use stones to break open clams. Beavers not infrequently shape wood as they construct dams to hold water to store and preserve food they need during winter. Chimpanzees use rocks or heavy sticks to crack open hard-shelled fruit and nuts; they also fashion drinking cups and rain-sheltering umbrellas from banana leaves, and use sticks to extract insects and grubs from small holes.&lt;ref&gt;See Andrew Whiten and Christophe Boesch, “The Cultures of Chimpanzees,” ''Scientific American'', January 2001, 61-67, for intriguing descriptions of chimpanzee behaviour. Neighbouring communities of chimps apparently occasionally battle each other to the death. (Ah! Perhaps we can blame a common ancestor for contributing the same trait to us.)&lt;/ref&gt; Birds also make and use tools.&lt;ref&gt;Crows in the New Caledonian rain forest are as advanced in their ability to use tools as were Stone Age humans. The birds strip bark from a twig, cut the twig just below an offshoot to create a hook, and then insert this hook into tree cavities to remove insects and larvae. They also use a barbed type of leaf which they peck into a tapered point for similar functions (showing a left-handed preference when tailoring pine needles). They make several different types of tools, each for its own specific purpose, and even produce tools in assembly line fashion—that is, they finish a number of tools before using any of them. Man did not reach this stage until the Lower Palaeolithic era, 2.5 million to 200,000 years ago.
Readers with an interest in the intelligence of birds, crows in particular, will enjoy Bernd Heinrich’s book, ''Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds'' (New York: Harper Collins, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animal behaviourists contend that their studies demonstrate animals can think. Hausser declares that animals think,&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Hauser, ''Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think'' (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2000), 209.&lt;/ref&gt; but simply lack the ability to express their many thoughts and emotions to others.&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin states that animals can assess their environment, consider alternative actions and make decisions—all necessitating the ability to think.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, ''The Ascent of Mind'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt; That animals can think implies that thinking, like every other biological feature and process, has evolved over the ages. Thinking certainly did not suddenly spring, fully formed, into existence in humans.

The specific content of any mind (animal or human) is currently hidden to investigators because the mind functions only when neural networks are biochemically or electrically activated, and, to date, scientists have no technique precise enough to find out just which memories of the multitude locked in the brain’s neural patterns are being activated at any particular instant.&lt;ref&gt;However, Wilder Penfield, in his experiments that electrically stimulated points within the brain, may have been close to finding out. (This kind of investigative work is considered unethical and is not practiced today.)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, neural networks are real; they can be seen (and photographed as they develop) increasing in complexity as infants age and learn. (The increasing complexity of an adult’s learning brain is hidden within, and masked by, its multitude of existing neural pathways.) The biochemical flows that retrieve and carry information stored within these neural patterns is also real. In short, neural networks whose paths store memories within the brain constitute the mind, and thinking depends upon biochemical flows activating some or many of these networks, so releasing (and making available for potential use) the information they hold.

: Thanks. I might also recommend just using the page [[Art Tutorials]] as a contents page until the book gets large enough to warrant moving it elsewhere. The neat thing about this is that the software will automagically generate a link from each subpage to the contents page, without you having to add it in for each page. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:29, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

== From '''Lothlorien History: Fall 1990 - Summer 1995''' ==

July through November 1994: Eric Ongerth needs a place to live after graduating and moving out of room 207. He awakes one summer night with a feverish, chocolate-powered dream of how to suspend a home in the redwood tree. Soon a one-room cabin begins to take shape in the tree right across from the third flor of North House. Working on it six days a week, Eric soon has a place to stay, and lives out a most beautiful year among the birds and squirrels, waking every day to brilliant sunlight, wooden beams, and the grind of traffic at the Prospect/Channing intersection.

By 1995 the treehouse grows infamous within the coop system and those members of other houses who eat the most granola and spend the most time drumming in the forest come and visit. Central maintenance personnel do their best to pretend it doesn't exist. The Daily Cal places the treehouse #1 on a list of &quot;best places for a date&quot;.

Enrique's joke consist of a simple formula. Simply take a racist term, add a profane word, and follow it by some form of excrement. (ie; Wop's like to fuck crap). If this fails, then shout a string of obscenities, grab your penis, or pretend to hump something invisible.

MOOOOOOOOO!

== From '''Getting a date/Cautionary note''' ==
Getting a date, or worse yet, falling in love, can change the way you see the whole world. You may never be able to go back to the way you saw it before. You may even skip against your will, in public, where others can see you. Don't say you weren't warned.

== Excerpt from '''Wikijunior Languages/Galactic Basic''' ==
Galactic Basic uses the &quot;Aurabesh&quot; script of writing. The Aurabesh look very different from standard English letters, but they still sound exactly like English letters. ... In real life, this language is English, but in the fictional Star Wars world, billions of people speak Galactic Basic, which is commonly called &quot;Basic&quot;. ... Galactic Basic is spoken just like English. In fact, speaking English is virtually speaking Basic! So any English words you know are also part of Galactic Basic.

The only difference is that they are written in the Aurabesh script.</text>

This Wikibook teaches the reader to speak the Klingon Language.  It supplies a fast yet complete method of learning tlhIngan Hol, by providing auditory aid and structured information for fast absorption by the reader.

This Wikibook presents a structure which conveys basic Klingon language first; then moves into example usage and extended vocabulary.  Some chapters consist entirely of Klingon, with the occasional annotation introducing a new word; these chapters present the reader with a straight-forward exercise to reinforce their interpretive Klingon language skills.

Sound clips of Klingon speech provide the reader with an auditory aid; some of the Klingon-only chapters supply complete recordings of entire sections.  Readers will benefit greatly by reading these sections aloud and using the recordings to check their pronunciation.

==Ingredients==
*1/3 block [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], soft, drained 15 minutes
*1/2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced 
*1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced 
*1 sun dried [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] slice, diced, (usually come in packages sliced) 
*[[Cookbook:Spinach|Spinach]], flat leaf, a small handful 
*Red pepper 
*Turmeric or [[Cookbook:Curry|curry]] (for a spicier dish)
*Flavored salt (optional) 
*[[Cookbook:Olive oil|Olive]] or vegetable oil (or veggie butter) 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and pepper
*Flour tortillas, or vegan bread (1-3, optional)
 
==Procedure==
# Add about 1-2 tablespoon (15-30g) oil to sauce pan. Add onion, garlic and sun dried tomato to pan, cook until soft and golden.
# While that is cooking, mash tofu (I use my fingers) until they get an even scrambled texture and add spices. I never measure, so use your own judgment on the spices.
# I usually add 2 dashes red pepper, two dashes turmeric, salt the top of my mound twice and pepper it once, and add a pinch of flavored salt. Then mix it all in until evenly distributed.
# When onion mix is cooked, add tofu and spinach. Heat through (until spinach is soft and wilted looking) 

I like it in a flour tortilla, like a breakfast burrito, or in vegan bread, like a breakfast sandwich, but eat as you like. I think it really tastes a lot like eggs. 

Enjoy! 

=Alternate Version=

==Ingredients==
*1 green onion
*2 small cloves garlic
*2 strips Smart [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or other breakfast meat substitute 
*1/2 large block of firm tofu
*Couple dashes of turmeric 
*Splash of liquid aminos 
*Pinch of nutritional yeast flakes 
*Oil (for the pan)

==Procedure==
#First, you've got to heat up the pan on medium- high heat with the oil to cook the bacon. But don't cook it too long or it will be overcooked once you're done.
#While you're cooking the bacon, start chopping up the garlic and green onion.
#Press as much water from the tofu as possible, then use a cheese grater to grate the tofu into semi-small chunks. You could probably mash it a bit with a fork instead, but I find grating to be a lot quicker.
#After you have the tofu grated into a bowl, add the onion, garlic, bacon (cooked and cut into small pieces by this time), the turmeric and liquid aminos. You'll want to stir this up gently until you are satisfied that everything is well mixed.
#Put it in the pan (it should sizzle a bit) and sprinkle the nutritional yeast flakes over the top.
#Keep stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes or until you've got the desired look of scrambled &quot;eggs.&quot; 

I like to eat this with some hash browns, of course. This is very very tasty, if i do say so myself. Oh, and be careful with the turmeric. it stains everything yellow...

==Copyrighted material==

Make sure that &quot;all contributions to Wikibooks are considered to be released under the GNU Free Documentation License.)  For this project it is doubly so because almost all of the material is copyrighted by Paramount Pictures and Michael Okrand.  Make sure that anything that is added to this project meets all of the standards, and try to avoid &quot;fair-use&quot; material unless you are absolutely sure that it is legal.

That said, this is a neat language, and I think it is possible to write an original language guide for the &quot;Warrior's Tongue&quot;.  Good luck, and I hope that this turns into something more than a simple stub.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:40, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

== Flesh this out ==

This Wikibook should really be fleshed out.  The interesting thing about the Klingon language is it's structured differently than other languages.  The way the human mind works is complex, but a lot of it involves piping through the language center; this makes Klingon extremely interesting.

Consider a room for a moment, an empty room with the following shape:

         Black
       a-------------b
       |             |
 Black |             | Red
       c-------------d         Black

Each corner has a compartment to hide an object in.  Hide food in it; spin a person around; and then have them find the object.  You'll get varied results:

# A normal person can find the food easily
# A young child with workable language skills can find the food easily
# A young child without developed language skills can find the food 50% of the time
# A rat can find the food 50% of the time
# A normal person with developed language skills can find the food 50% of the time if he is busy holding a conversation while the food is being hidden

You may ask why (1) and (2) find the food easily but (3), (4), and (5) can only get it half the time.  It turns out that the room has two main properties, that being color and geometry.  You have four corners in the room based on this:

* Red/Black Corners (2)
** Black on the left (''b'')
** Black on the right (''d'')
* Black/Black Corners (2)
** Short wall on the left (''a'')
** Short wall on the right (''c'')

Let's try to deinterlace these into solid categories '''geometry''' and '''color'''.

* Geometry
** Short wall on the left (''a'', ''d'')
** Short wall on the right (''b'', ''c'')
* Color
** Red/Black (''b'', ''d'')
** Black/Black (''a'',''c'')

Considering either of these, we can identify any pair of corners; but we can't identify any corner uniquely.  We have to actually combine color and geometry; notice each set in '''Color''' shares one and only one item with each set in ''Geometry''.

It turns out that while the language center is occupied, humans can't connect Color and Geometry to form a complete identifier.  This experiment was conducted and documented by Hermer-Vazquez, L., E. S. Spelke, and A. S. Katsnelson, 1999, &quot;Sources of flexibility in human cognition:  Dual-task studies of space and language,&quot; Cognitive Psychology, 39(1): 3-36.

More interesting is that a young child or an animal without language skills is incapable of doing it; this indicates that the language center doesn't just function as an extra blob of processing power, but an actual structured processing center that functions based on the language (or lack thereof) it is processing.

In other words, the structure and grammar of a language influence how the brain processes information.  This in turn means that your choice of language affects exactly ''how'' you solve a problem.  This is the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

So there you have it.  Mr. Whorf, fire.

== Audio ==

Someone should record some audio of Klingon for helping to instruct people how to speak it.  It'd be a lot easier than trying to figure out pronunciation keys, since most lay-people don't quite get it.
--[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] 18:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== E-Prime ==

Nice to see a book aiming to write in e-prime but there are many cases where this isn't done... in 'Why Learn Klingon' you say &quot;you're wondering&quot; which is clearly a violation of the rules of e-prime. :) [[User:Xania|Xania]] 23:40, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

:Nice to see someone who notices ;)  I'll clean that up as I go.  I've mostly spent my time working on the [[Klingon/English dictionary of Klingon words|English Dictionary of Klingon Words]], and will clean up the other stuff before I go on to grammar. --[[User:Bluefoxicy|Bluefoxicy]] 17:32, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== Words ==

Just begging with Klingon, and I've seen the term ''petaQ'' also spelt ''p'tahk'', at least, I think its the same, they seem to pronounce the same and they have the same meaning. Is this a common type of discrepancy? I would add some form of sig, but I lack an account.

:Oh dear, that comment was added almost a year ago, but I'll answer it anyway for anyone who might stumble across this: ''petaQ'' is the spelling of the word in Klingon, and ''p'tahk'' is the English version that approximates the sounds of ''petaQ''. This is similar to the difference between ''bat'leth'' and ''batlh'letlh'', the former is the English version, the latter official tlhIngan Hol. --[[User:Bozwaldo|Bozwaldo]] ([[User talk:Bozwaldo|talk]]) 05:04, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

== Updating ==

Seeing as this book hasn't been updated since the original Kahless was emperor ;-), I've been going around adding modules, fixing errors, etc.
--[[User:Bozwaldo|Bozwaldo]] ([[User talk:Bozwaldo|talk]]) 19:29, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

So please help, if you can. :)
--[[User:Bozwaldo|Bozwaldo]] ([[User talk:Bozwaldo|talk]]) 19:30, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Another thing: I'm thinking that a Sentence of the Week in Klingon could be maintained, as learning Klingon is so much easier when one has context clues to go on. :)
Thoughts? -- [[User:Bozwaldo|Bozwaldo]] ([[User talk:Bozwaldo|talk]]) 22:37, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

==Titles==

As the Esperanto wikibook has the title of each section in Esperanto and English, I'm planning on doing the same (with Klingon) for each title in this book. --[[User:Bozwaldo|Bozwaldo]] ([[User talk:Bozwaldo|talk]]) 21:55, 18 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

{{Gothic alphabet}}

Gothic has no indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;).

The definite article (&quot;the&quot;) is in the Gothic Bible replaced by the demonstrative pronoun, therefore, the definite articles aren't really definite articles but demonstrative pronouns, research however shows that there are not a lot of cases in which the Greek definite article is translated in Gothic. The demonstrative pronoun has a different form for each of the four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive and dative), the three genders (feminine, masculine and neuter), and for singular and plural.

== Feminine ==

The Wikijunior community has adopted some restrictions on what titles can be created within Wikijunior.

==Suggesting a title==
To suggest a title, visit the [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions|New Title Suggestions]] page and add the title to a list of proposed Wikijunior books. Regular Wikijunior contributors will be able to view this title and make suggestions. 

Please try to follow the format when suggesting a new title. Include a list of possible articles that would be within the book. Talk about the audience and scope of the title. Provide a list of questions that will be addressed by the articles.

==Voting on new titles==
One way that new books are added to Wikijunior is that they have passed through the [[Wikijunior:New Book Collaboration|New Book Collaboration]] voting process.  This process is designed to make sure that new books are launched regularly and that books have a high level of community support.

== Other ways of adding books ==
Voting is not the only way to add a book to Wikijunior. In unusual circumstances when trying to meet a contractual obligation such as what has happened with the Beck Foundation when Wikijunior was started, specific book projects can be created by the community independently of the voting process.

If an individual author would like to start a new book on Wikijunior and is willing to contribute substantial content, the author can create the book, suggest it in [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions|New Title Suggestions]], and add it to the [[Wikijunior:All Books|list of all books]]. 

Sometimes a suitable book with substantial appropriate content can be adopted by community consensus into the group of recognized Wikijunior titles without going through the New Book of the Quarter voting process.

==Additional notes==
This is a Wikijunior specific policy, and not something that pertains to Wikibooks in general. 
If in the future, there is increased activity on Wikijunior, this whole policy may be substantially revised or done away with, but for now this will give us a chance to gradually expand without being overwhelmed with a bunch of book stubs that don't go anywhere.

Adding a new Wikijunior book is not a huge thing. Even a brand-new contributors are encouraged to suggest a new title. If you want to write a book and are willing to put the hard work into developing substantial content yourself, we encourage you to do so. Have fun and enjoy working with Wikijunior. We are glad that you are here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am creating this policy because I think the previous policy of not allowing ''any'' new Wikijunior books to be created is just too much over the top.  If we want to gradually add new Wikijunior books, there should be some sort of process of allowing it to happen.  This is hopefully a compromise between allowing any title to be created (like Wikibooks in general) and not allowing anything at all to be added.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:30, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

Personally, I think that we should admit one book from every category at a time. I'm good at writing science-kinda stuff, and I'm disappointed when the latest one to work on is about language. --[[User:Sam T. Jazzhands|Sam T. Jazzhands]] 19:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:I'm trying to gague participation levels for these new Wikijunior projects.  Wikijunior Elements only lost by a single vote during the last round, and indeed was declared the winner by one user.  And the previous book was about Dinosaurs... which is a science related book.  The whole point of doing this is to keep from overwhelming Wikijunior proofreaders and to try and raise the bar for the quality of the material being produced.  So far, some incredibly outstanding content has developed.  This is also an experiment to see if a slow growth approach really does improve the quality of the material being written, or if instead we should have a free-for-all write anything and everything, with stubs everywhere.  I would like to move this to a new Wikijunior book every month, but I would like to see a user base large enough to support that many new books coming out all of the time.  As it is, we are barely able to keep up with even producing a good Wikijunior book once every three months.  I hope that changes.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:59, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Suggested Wikijunior Book Titles ==
=== Adventures in Architecture ===
* Description: A book about architecture, but more of an activity book than a textbook.
** Scope: All aspects of architecture, from historical buildings, through build-it-yourself models, through learning to appreciate the architecture in your own hometown.
** Purpose: To educate about architecture specifically, but more broadly to engage children in a creative learning process. 
** Narrative: As explained, this would not really be a narrative textbook, but the educational content would be provided primarily through activities.  Of course background material will also be provided.
* Audience: Inquisitive children, with some activities also involving their parents taking them to interesting places, and some activities involving games they can play with their friends.
** Target Age: 8-12
** Academic Prerequisites: None
* Organization
** Section Titles:
*** What's a Pyramid good for?
*** All Roads lead to Rome
*** etc.
** Standard Section Headings:

*** Take a Hike! (outdoor excursions to look at local buildings)
*** What would you build? (creative thinking exercises)
*** Games (simple activities that can be done at any time)
*** Puzzle Tower (drawing puzzles inspired by architectural problems)
* Notes: This was inspired by some of the educational books I appreciated most when I was younger.  It is my hope that some of the other Wikijunior titles might in future also employ the 'creative' approach.

Hello! In my humble opinion would this book describe too much for the intended audience with age 8 to 12. You have written almost all which someone can know about electricity. Most grown up people would not know how a motor works. Please cut it down a bit. To write a book for children, you have to make it interesting. Tell a story and talk about how the current in a bicycle dynamo gets into the lamp. --[[User:SvonHalenbach|SvonHalenbach]] ([[User talk:SvonHalenbach|talk]]) 14:22, 16 December 2007 (UTC)

Svon: '''Horsefeathers'''.  So '''WHAT''' if most adults don't know how a motor works (having taught University Physics, I can say unequivocally you are correct in this claim).  One can teach a child not only how a motor works, but tie it to a key concept (electro-magnetism relationships) and teach them a crux detail (a commutator) and how to make a working motor using lacquered wire, a battery, a couple paper clips, and a magnet.  Comprehensiveness (too many topics) may be a fault here, since a '''few''' electrical examples and a few *electronic* examples could introduce concepts adequately and guide the child to another lesson.  But nothing about electricity or electronics (aside from safety) is out of the grasp of a child; just look at the way they devour statistics and names of sports stars and dinosaurs and geography.

Although the idea seems to be very valid I worry whether such books should be considered in this voting system. Their simplicity would lead to few comprehensive books being tagged as official and therefore I would suggest if they could rather be created in another system, appropriate for quicker acceptance of such books. --[[User:82.10.198.113|82.10.198.113]] 19:00, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

I had an idea for something like this a while back when I was trying to get colors across to my son. The particular problem this book addresses is the difficulty one-year-olds have with learning colors.  The problem seems to be that there are a lot of different shades; you can point to two different red things, e.g. cherries and strawberries, and say they are both red... but it takes a long time for the child to get it because the thing you are pointing at are actually different colors.  there are lots of kids books with objects and colors, but the problem is they are random objects - nobody ever says &quot;look at that - it's a teddy-bear blue colour&quot;.  I've not got just 'green' (duh), I've got bottle, olive, lime, pea, leaf, emerald, mint and fern-green -- and pictures of each item (e.g. bottle-green, http://imageafter.com/image.php?image=b19glass019.jpg) with a breakout box containing the color and a line to a point on the image where it actually is that color in the box.  63 colors in total!  And I suppose you could follow up with color patterns.  I was going to publish it hardcopy, but have never done a book before.  My 5yo is happy with biscuit-brown and custard-yellow etc.  Would this be along the lines you are thinking?&lt;br /&gt;

*Discussion
Female care-givers typically abuse children in largely invisible ways that may appear to a superficial observer as normal discipline or over-protectiveness. They succeed in their abuse due to the tremendous control that they have over the child. Frequently, even after abuse is conclusively proven, through photographs or videos, the child will deny that the abuse took place. This book would serve to empower children and help them to acknowledge the abuse in a safe, nurturing, way.

I would suggest a different name. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 23:06, 11 July 2008 (UTC)

==About the Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations==
[[Image:Wikijunior_Ancient_Civlizations_II.png|right|267px|thumb|'''Welcome to [[Wikijunior]] Ancient Civilizations.''']]

The target age of this title is 8&amp;ndash;12 years old. Section titles will include major groups of people or substantial empires in ancient times. The print version will focus only on answering a specific series of questions about selected civilizations. There will be an introduction and a basic discussion of archaeology.  

When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. Being understood is just as important as being accurate. Authors should concentrate on the most important concepts rather than getting wrapped up in every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work.

[[en:Image:Egypt Nil.jpg|thumb|right|150px|View of the Nile from the river]]
[[en:Image:Nile River and delta from orbit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|What the Nile looks like from space]]

The Egyptians lived along the River Nile, the &quot;fertile river&quot; in north eastern Africa.  This river flows from the central part of Africa.  The Nile's water flows north, until it empties into the Mediterranean Sea. At the northern most part of the Nile, the Nile forms a '''delta'''.  The delta of a river is formed at the river's mouth, where it leaves behind dirt and other sediment. At the delta a river often branches out into a wider, triangular shape. 

The Nile was very important to life in Egypt. Seasonal floods every year covered the land near the river with fresh silt, making the land very good for growing food. In order to grow more food, people built '''irrigation''' canals to move water from the river to nearby areas. The Sahara Desert makes up much of the surrounding area, so most people didn't travel very far from the Nile. The surrounding desert land made the rich soil of the Nile very important for growing crops. 

Egyptian transportation systems included boats that traveled north and south along the river. Boats could easily travel north, with the current of the river, but they could go south easily as well. The winds along the river usually blew to the south, so the Egyptians would raise sails on their boats and head against the current with the help of the wind!

The Nile was extremely important to the Egyptian civilization. A Greek historian, Herodotus traveled the river thousands of years after the Egyptians started their civilization. He is often quoted as saying that &quot;Egypt is the gift of the Nile.&quot; This means that, there could not have been a civilization in Egypt without the Nile and what it made possible for the people there.

==What did their buildings look like?==

There were two types of buildings that the ancient Egyptians lived in. One was called the '''worker's home'''. The other was the '''town house''', which was for wealthier people. Both types of houses were built from bricks. Stone was only used for building permanent structures, such as the Pyramids. The bricks were made from a mixture of mud, pebbles, and straw. The builders would pour the mixture into wooden frames and leave it in the sun to dry and harden. Buildings made from such bricks eventually crumbled, and new buildings were constructed right on top of the ruins. This led to the formation of tells or hills. Houses were often built along the Nile River, but they had to be high to avoid flooding. 

A worker's home was usually one-story high and had up to four rooms. There was a yard and a kitchen in the back of the house, as well as two underground storage cellars. The roofs of the Egyptians houses were flat, and people spent much of their time there. Egyptian families slept, cooked, and ate their meals on the roof. It was a bit like having a living room, kitchen, dining room, and bedroom all up on the roof. The Egyptians did not have running water in their homes, but water could be taken from nearby wells. Workers' homes had very little furniture, including beds and storage chests for clothes.

The houses of the wealthy were much larger and up to three stories tall. Because the walls were much higher, they had to be supported by wooden beams. The walls of the first floor were sometimes made of stone for added strength. Different levels of the house served different purposes. The first floor was where business and work was conducted. The second and third floors were the living space for the family and had nicer furnishings. The roof was used for preparing and cooking meals that were then brought in by the servants. Wealthy homes had gardens, pools, and small shrines for worship. Some houses were decorated with tiled floors, barred windows, fancy staircases, and painted walls. The ceilings were high and held up with columns.

The pyramids were large stone structures built to house the bodies of the Egyptian rulers, or '''Pharaohs''', after they died. The pyramids were built high, because it was believed to be the ruler's staircase to heaven. Although the most famous shape is the familiar three-dimensional triangle, pyramids were built in a variety of shapes. They were all built with the help of simple machines, including '''pulleys''', '''inclined planes''', and '''levers'''. The inside walls of the pyramids were decorated with '''hieroglyphics''', the picture-based writing of the Egyptians. The tomb of the Pharaoh was located in a room deep in the heart of the pyramid, and was filled with gold, jewels, and other riches. It was also filled with other everyday objects that might be needed by the dead Pharaoh during his journey to the afterlife. This could include food, clothing, utensils, pottery, and furniture. Sometimes, even servants were sealed up in the tomb! Because of all the treasure inside the tomb, robbers sometimes broke into the pyramids, but their maze-like interior could cause them to get lost and die of starvation. Another defense against robbers were the curses written at the entrance of the pyramids. Most ancient Egyptians were very superstitious, and the curses were frightening enough to keep them away. Unfortunately, as centuries passed, thieves grew less afraid of the curses and managed to steal many of the ancient treasures that had been in the tombs for ages.

==What did they eat?==
 
The ancient Egyptians ate food that is not much different from what we eat today. Because the Nile River supplied them with a constant water source, the Egyptians were able to grow many different kinds of crops in their desert environment. Common crops included grains, vegetables, and fruit. The Egyptians relied on these crops as their main food source, because it was expensive to raise animals.  Therefore, most domestic animals were used as work animals rather than as food. Often, Egyptian families hunted wild animals in order to add meat to their diets.  

The Egyptians ate many different kinds of bread. The dough was made from grain, yeast, eggs, butter, salt, milk, and spices. In early times, it was cooked over an open fire.  Later, pre-heated stone slabs were used. The bread was usually flat and round, but it might be shaped in rolls for special occasions. It could be plain or filled with beans, vegetables, or other ingredients. If sweet bread was desired, it would be flavoured with honey, fruit, or dates. Honey was the main sweetener for the Egyptians, because they had not discovered sugar. They also believed that honey had healing properties.

Fruits and vegetables made up a large part of the Egyptian diet. The abundant water of the Nile River allowed vegetables to be grown almost all year round except summer. Common vegetables included: cucumbers, onions, cabbage, garlic, radishes, leeks, and more. Green vegetables were often served with a dressing, usually made of vinegar and oil, not unlike the salad dressings we use today. The hot climate limited the variety of fruits that grew in Egypt, but figs, pomegranates, dates, melons, and grapes were readily available. Other fruits like coconuts, apples, and peaches were imported by wealthy people.

Fish was also a large part of their diet, although many rich people would not eat it. Fish was usually eaten fried, boiled, or roasted. It was also often sun-dried.

The Egyptians mainly ate beef. They also ate lamb, pork, goat, fish, duck, and geese. The rich soil made it easy to grow food. The rich soil came from yearly flooding that the Egyptians could predict. They grew barley, wheat, lentils, cucumbers, beans, leeks, onions, dates, figs and grapes. Everybody ate different foods. Poor people ate bread, onions, and other vegetables. Rich people ate cakes sweetened with honey. Their food was cooked in clay ovens.

==What did they wear?==
Most Egyptians wore white tunics made of linen. This clothing style was comfortable in the hot climate of Egypt. For men, this tunic came up to the knee, while for women, it reached the ankle. Women sometimes wore shawls with their dresses. While working, men wore loincloths, but many workers wore nothing at all. Women wore shorter skirts while working. Children often didn't wear clothes during the summer, but when winter came, they dressed in cloaks and wraps. Wealthier people had pleats in their clothing, and some noblewomen wore beaded dresses. 

Egyptians wore sandals made of palm fiber or braided papyrus for shoes. Most people went barefoot and carried their shoes, wearing them only when necessary. Women seldom wore shoes, because most of their work was indoors.

Royalty wore ceremonial clothes which were elaborately decorated with feathers and sequins. The Pharaoh's sandals and gloves were both highly ornamented.

Both men and women wore makeup, which was made by mixing powdered minerals with oil. They also used a reddish dye called 'henna.' Unlike other ancient civilizations, the Egyptians were quite clean and washed and oiled themselves with scented oil before dressing. They used combs, razors, and tweezers as part of their hygiene routine. Men and women both wore wigs, which were changed every day and made from human hair or wool. Curled wigs were worn on special occasions.

Jewellery was a normal part of any Egyptian's outfit. All classes wore some type of jewellery. made of either gold or colorful beads or stones. Lapis lazuli and turquoise were used to make necklaces. Earrings and rings made of clay were also worn as a fashion accessory.

==What did they believe?==

During most of Egypt's history, '''polytheism''' (the belief in many gods) was practiced. One of the most important gods was Ra the sun god. Several of the gods were based on animals, or had animals as their symbols. One god was often shown as a jackal and another as a cow.

Often, there were myths told about these gods and goddesses that explained some of the major ideas in ancient Egypt. One famous myth involves Isis and Osiris. This story helped explain several of the most important beliefs, such as the belief in the '''afterlife''' .

Egyptians believed that after people died, they went to an afterlife, where they would continue their lives as they lived them on Earth. To do this successfully, however, they had to preserve everything that they had in life on Earth. This is the reason that Pharaohs were buried with everything that they owned. Pharaohs, and others who were rich enough, would have scenes of their life on Earth painted on the walls of their tombs, so that those same sorts of scenes could be &quot;relived&quot; in the afterlife. This is also why Egyptians believed in '''mummification''': the body had to be preserved, so that the spirit, called the ''''ka'''', could return to the body after death.

Under the rule of one Pharaoh named Akhenaten, Egypt became '''monotheist''', meaning that they believed in one god. During this time, they worshipped the god Aten, another sun god. Monotheism was never fully embraced by the people of Egypt, however, and after the Pharaoh's death, the Egyptian people went back to polytheism.

==What did their writing look like?==

[[Image:Egypt Hieroglyphe2.jpg|right|thumb|Hieroglyphs.]]

The Egyptians had three types of writing. The first is called '''hieroglyphics'''.  This was a kind of picture writing in which pictures and characters make up words.  This can be very hard to read, because the words often run together, and the Egyptians didn’t use punctuation.  Another form of writing is called  ““Priests’ Writing.”” This form is the same as hieroglyphics, but written very fast in a cursive style.  Last came “Demotic,” which became popular during the time when Egypt was ruled by Pharaohs.

Egyptians could carve hieroglyphs into stone, mud brick, or '''papyrus''' (paper made by pounding the stems of a reed until they stick together).  Egyptian writing was so difficult that only a very few people learned to read it.  If these “scribes” worked very hard, they could become court officials or priests. After Christianity became the religion of the Roman Empire, knowledge of how to speak and write Ancient Egyptian disappeared. In the early 1800s, a large slab of stone with three different forms of writing on it was found. Because it was found near the town of Rosetta in the Egyptian delta, it was called the '''Rosetta Stone'''.  

Several years later, a man named Jean-François Champollion discovered that one of the languages on the stone was a form of Greek that he knew how to read.  The three languages were hieroglyphs, Demotic, and Greek.  By gradually comparing common words between the Greek and Egyptian languages, he was able to get a basic understanding of how the ancient Egyptian language worked.  However, it has taken the work of many other people to understand Egyptian writing. Even today, there are many signs and words we do not understand. People are still working to put together the puzzle of what all the symbols mean.

==Are some of them famous even today?==

[[Image:Tutanchamun Maske.jpg|right|thumb|Tutankhamun's burial mask.]]
Yes!  King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as &quot;King Tut&quot; or &quot;The Boy King&quot;, is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.  Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists.  However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity.  While many tombs of the past were robbed, this tomb was left virtually undisturbed.  Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones.  This is why he has become so popular in modern times. The discovery of this tomb has allowed historians and archaeologists to have a glimpse of what some of the more important kings may have had in their burial chambers before they were robbed.

Another king, called &quot;Akheonaten&quot; is also famous today. Akhenaten was Tutankhamun's father, and he tried to change the Egyptian religion from many gods to just one god called &quot;Aten&quot;, who only the King could worship. This was a very big change for the people of Egypt and may have been unpopular. Akhenaten built a new city called '''Amarna''', but when he died it was abandoned until it was discovered by archaeologists. They were able to see how Egyptians built their cities because it was so well preserved. Egyptologists and historians have argued for many years about why Akhenaten would change the religion that had flourished for thousands of years. Some believe he may have worshipped the &quot;Aten&quot; as his father, Amenhotep III, others think he wanted to make himself more powerful by only allowing the king to worship the god.

==What is left of them today?==

[[Image:Gizeh Cheops BW 1.jpg|right|thumb|The Great Pyramid.]]
Even today Egypt is still a major country with a large population.  Many modern Egyptians still live near the same land that their ancestors lived on thousands of years ago.

The ancient Egyptians wrote messages that they carved into the wall of many of their buildings, and most of the early work by Egyptologists was based on these writings.  Moreover, thousands of papyrus scrolls -- on every aspect of life and many areas of knowledge -- have remained, many still untranslated, to this day.  We have much of their art and jewellery as well.  Many major pieces were recovered from King Tutankhamen's tomb, and from the tombs of many other Pharaohs.  One of the more famous works is the bust of Neffertiti.

Many of the Ancient Egyptians' buildings, tombs and monuments survive, although most are in ruins.     Still, there is much to be learned about Egyptian politics, history, religion, and scientific ideas.

==Page Split==
The split is done.  Maybe time to clean up this talk page [[User:Agriculturist50|Agriculturist50]] ([[User talk:Agriculturist50|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Agriculturist50|contribs]]) 23:07, 23 January 2015 (UTC)


The opening page is too long and some of the ending sections would be considered advanced topics.  I propose moving most of the Content below M-file programming into advanced topics. Excluded in the move would be Alternatives to MATLAB, the references section, and the links section.

If anyone wants to add a highly specific task, go to the advanced topics section. It will clog this book up if it is added at the main page [[User:Agriculturist50|Agriculturist50]] ([[User talk:Agriculturist50|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Agriculturist50|contribs]]) 15:38, 23 January 2015 (UTC)

== Reorganizing ==
Reorganized for readability.  There are multiple alternatives to MATLAB, so just created an entire section for alternatives.  It does seem prudent to point out early a free alternative is available. Also found place for operators reference.  

Much of what was on the intro page has been split to its own pages.

== Capitalization ==

The capitalization MATlab is very odd.  The Mathworks web site uses MATLAB.

== [[Template:Matlab CMD]] ==

{{Matlab CMD|&lt;command name&gt;}}

I created this template for use in some books on the Engineering bookshelf. It's just a simple template (for now), that mentions when matlab has a certain feature. You type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Matlab CMD|&lt;command name&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and it produces the template at left. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:36, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

== more editing ==

I'm writing several Matlab scripts as part of my course, so I decided to contribute to this wikibook as I go along, since it seems to need a lot of work. This could help my coursemates - so they won't nag me too much asking for help in the problems =P. Any criticisms/assistance on my work would be most welcome. -Arthur

== Organizing ==

This wikibook is getting a bit lengthy, is it possible to break this up into several pages like the other books? Like one section on Graphics, one section on functions, and so on.

== Organizing ==

I've managed to get 'Graphics' into a separate page, although there are a few rough edges to iron out. I'll start moving other sections into their own pages soon, if someone could help me make it look better (seems i'm not doing a very good job, i'm just copying formatting code from other wikibooks) it would be appreciated of course. -Arthur


== Organizing 3 ==

File Naming Constraints:
This is already under &quot;Saving and Loading a MATLAB file&quot; so I will work on removing the duplication under &quot;examples&quot;, since it IMO makes more sense in the saving and loading section anyway. If you agree with me I'll put it up as a speedy delete.

Inserting Single Quotes:
This, I think, along with the two NEWLINE topics, can be merged into a single topic, I'm not sure what I would title it though, maybe 'character tricks' or something like that?

A3392: I know you've been doing a lot on this book, so let me know if you disagree with any of the changes I make. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 20:43, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

== MATLAB, permissions and images ==

I've been in contact with representatives from The MathWorks about MATLAB. The MathWorks has an entire department dedicated to working with authors of MATLAB-related books. According to a representative from The MathWorks, If we would like to post screenshots of the MATLAB environment or images of MATLAB-generated graphics, we should email a copy of those images to The MathWorks in order to secure the correct permissions, and then we can upload the images here for use in our books. Essentially, by receiving explicit permission to use these images, we can upload screenshots of MATLAB without having to worry about Fair-Use problems. 

To that end, I am going to create a Template for tagging MATLAB images that indicates the copyright status of those images, and other information. I am also going to create a category, [[:Category:MATLAB Images]] that will contain a cannonical list of all images that were released for use in Wikibooks under this program. 

For further information about this, please send me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:51, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

== Octave *and* matlab programming ==

The title itself emphasizes only the proprietary (and expenseive) matlab application.

While it is written that Octave is nearly a clone, and that most would apply to both, I think it would make a lot of send that the title be changed to &quot;Octave and matlab programming&quot; that stresses the fact that one is very close to the other.
For differences, eg. graphics, some could be done with matlab and other with octave. Some special inputs could also be written to help overcome the differences, eg. doing some graphics in octave with the add-on like octaviz or matplotlib that make it very similar and inteactive too. Thanks --[[User:Npettiaux|npettiaux]] 07:54, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

: Though the two are very similar, I think the majority of people would be looking simply for MATLAB (just by virtue of the fact that more people use that than Octave in institutions etc.), and I think also that it would be easiest just to make a redirect from the &quot;Octave programming&quot; page to the MATLAB programming page to accommodate those who do happen to search for Octave. Actually, I'll do that after I post this. I do agree however that it would be useful to make note of some of the differences in the book. I myself am not familiar enough with Octave to know major differences between them but I think if you would like to write something about them they would surely have a welcomed place here. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 15:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

::I'm in agreement with Mattb here, Octave is similar to Matlab, but it isn't perfect compatability. Matlab also has a number of features that arent supported in Octave, and if we want to be comprehensive, we will essentially end up writing two separate books on these two programs, with some overlap. Instead of redirecting [[Octave Programming]] to here, I would recommend, instead that we create a separate book for Octave. We can crosslink between the two books where needed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:52, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:::After discussion on the Octave-help mailing list, we considered that as Octave has been conceived as a MATLAB clone, most differences can be considered as bugs. Therefore, Octave programming is due to be identical and the best would propably be in a separate chapter explaining the differences and the comparison. Therefore, differences and comparison between MATLAB and Octave are presented in [[Comparison Octave / MATLAB]]. --[[User:Npettiaux|npettiaux]] 15:07, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

{{SideBox|'''GNU Octave''' handles this task differently. For more information see the section about [[MATLAB Programming/Comparing Octave|Octave Differences]].}}
::::I hope you don't mind, i've renamed this page you created to be [[MATLAB Programming/Comparing Octave]]. The page that you had created wasn't technically &quot;in&quot; this book, and that causes some problems. Separate chapters would be a fine solution, and it would even be perfectly acceptable to use templates in the main body of the text to point out any incompatabilities as they arise (such as this template to the right). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:13, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::Thank you for your comment and correction and the inclusion of the page in the book. We shall work on them, and them delete the &quot;octave wikibook&quot; that has no need to remain. How can we use the nice template on the right to show the differences ? --[[User:Npettiaux|npettiaux]] 15:18, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: If you want to delete the octave programming book, Im not sure if it would qualify as speedy (probably not since the original page had multiple authors), you can list it under [[Wikibooks:votes for deletion]] and if you want to I can put the template on there. I doubt there'd be too much argument since its a lot of red links right now anyways. Nice template Whiteknight, I think that'll fit nicely. I'll change the format of the main page slightly to make it fit more with the rest of it (for example, moving the link from the title of the chapter to below it, since none of the other chapters is a link) but I think it's a good idea to have some pages about Octave, and just link to them in the template like Whiteknight proposes. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 22:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

Thanks to [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] a quick template can be used for octave differences, defined in [[Template:MATLAB/Octave]]. you can insert this template into the book by typing:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MATLAB/Octave| &lt; reason &gt; }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Where &quot;&lt; reason &gt;&quot; will be an optional explanation that you can add for clarity. --[[User:Npettiaux|npettiaux]] 23:10, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== Struct arrays ==

There exists a red link for struct arrays already, was the module you created meant to be Octave-specific? If it is, I propose moving the link to the &quot;octave&quot; section.

If not we can put it where the redlink is now (AFAIK struct arrays have nothing to do with object-oriented programming) and change the references to Octave to references to MATLAB. I think that the book should be centered around MATLAB except for the sections that are specific to Octave. The book ''is'' MATLAB programming, and Octave is the clone of MATLAB, not the other way around. In addition all references already existing are references to MATLAB. Finally, I think there is already a note on the page that most statements about MATLAB are also true in Octave, and the differences can be noted explicitly with Whiteknight's template, so we might as well keep the references consistent within the whole book. Let me know what you think. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 02:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Statistics ==

Is it possible to include a ''Statistics'' chapter in this book? [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 19:15, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

== Conditional Operators ==

There should be a section that contains a list of conditional operators in MATLAB for reference purposes.--[[Special:Contributions/99.16.58.18|99.16.58.18]] ([[User talk:99.16.58.18|talk]]) 21:04, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

== I/O ==
Where is the information on I/O? There is a chapter for usb and serial port I/O but no information about file I/O for things such as text files. Maybe it is there and I just can't find it. I suggest making it more obvious if it is there, and if it's not add some info about it.  [[User:Rhollis7|Rhollis7]] ([[User talk:Rhollis7|talk]]) 23:28, 18 October 2010 (UTC)

: {{done}}. The [[MATLAB Programming#More advanced I/O]] section has a link to [[MATLAB Programming#Reading and writing from files]] which seems to have all the info you need to read and write text files. Feel free to make that link more obvious. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 01:31, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

== clear &lt;var1&gt; &lt;var2&gt; ==

===1...d5===
With 1...d5, Black begins to fight for the center in the traditional fashion, by occupying it with pawns. 1...d5 opens a diagonal for the development of the light-squared black bishop, and it also discourages, though does not definitively prevent, an immediate 2.e4

===1...b5===
With this move, black prevents white from playing c4 and prepares his queen's bishop to be fianchettoed . However, white can just play e4 and still occupy the center with pawns.

Hello, Bron. I was wondering when will you finally atleast start your modules [[Magic Made Easy]] and [[Magic]]. There is also a [[Wikiversity:School of Magic|School of Magic]] within the [[Wikiversity]], so I believe you can contribute there, too. --[[User:Ђорђе Д. Божовић|Ђорђе Д. Божовић]] 14:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

== Magic again ==
Hi, Bron. Happy New Year! At the [[Wikiversity:School of Magic|School of Magic]] we need someone to be the teacher of the Ritual Magic, aka Spells. I believe you are a person who knows a lot about the practical usage of the Magic - how to perform a magical ritual, how to cast a spell, etc. So, it would be great if you join us! [[Wikiversity]] is a free, open-content wiki university, just like Wikipedia is a free encyclopaedia, and Wikibooks are open-content textbooks. Wikiversity is similar to Wikibooks, but still different, because Wikibooks are just simple textbooks, and Wikiversity is a community, a wiki, and there are courses given, not just textbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mechanical Vibrations==

One place homogenous equations of constant coefficients are used is in mechanical vibrations.  Lets imagine a mechanical system of a spring, a dampener, and a mass.  The force on the string at any point is &lt;math&gt;F=-kx&lt;/math&gt; where k is the spring constant.  The force on the dampener is &lt;math&gt;F=-cv&lt;/math&gt; where c is the damping constant.  And of course, the net force is &lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;.  That gives us a system where

&lt;math&gt;ma=-cv-kx&lt;/math&gt;

Remember that &lt;math&gt;v=x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a=x''&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us a differential equation of

&lt;math&gt;mx''=-cx'-kx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;mx''+cx'+kx=0&lt;/math&gt;



In the case where c=0, we have just a mass on a spring.  In this case, we have &lt;math&gt;x''+\frac{k}{m}x=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since k and m are both positive (by the laws of physics), the result is always a &lt;math&gt;y=c_1cos(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}x)+c_2sin(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}x)&lt;/math&gt;.  This makes sense from a physical perspective-  a spring moving back and forth forms a periodic wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;

To '''dice''' means to cut into small cubes, the size is often specified in the recipe and in classical French cooking are of four sizes:
* Brunoise &amp;ndash; ⅛ x ⅛ x ⅛ inch (3x3x3 mm) cubes
* Small dice &amp;ndash; ¼ x ¼ x ¼ inch (6x6x6 mm) cubes
* Medium dice &amp;ndash; ⅜ x ⅜ x ⅜ inch (9x9x9 mm) cubes
* Large dice &amp;ndash; ⅝ x ⅝ x ⅝ inch (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm) cubes

[[Cookbook:Cube|Cube]]

Other ways of cutting in to small pieces, but not cubes, include:

* Paysanne  &amp;ndash; This is not a cube but falls within the same category as dice. The dimensions are ½ x ½ x ¼ inches (12 x 12 x 6 mm)

* [[Cookbook:julienne|julienne]]
* [[Cookbook:chip|chip]]s

==Non-Homogeneous Equations==

A '''non-homogeneous''' equation of constant coefficients is an equation of the form

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+c_1\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+\ldots+c_ny=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are all constants and ''f''(''x'') is not 0.

===Complementary Function===

Every non-homogeneous equation has a '''complementary function''' (CF), which can be found by replacing the ''f''(''x'') with 0, and solving for the [[../Homogenous_1 | homogeneous solution]]. For example, the CF of

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-3\frac{dy}{dx}+4y=\frac{2 \sin x}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

is

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}-3\frac{dy}{dx}+4y=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Superposition Principle===

The superposition principle makes solving a non-homogeneous equation fairly simple.  The final solution is the sum of the solutions to the complementary function, and the solution due to ''f''(''x''), called the '''particular integral''' (PI).  In other words,

::General Solution = CF + PI

==Method of Undetermined Coefficients==

The '''method of undetermined coefficients''' is an easy shortcut to find the particular integral for some ''f''(''x'').  The method works only if a finite number of derivatives of ''f''(''x'') eventually reduces to 0, or if the derivatives eventually fall into a pattern in a finite number of derivatives.  If this is true, we then know part of the PI - the sum of all derivatives before we hit 0 (or all the derivatives in the pattern) multiplied by arbitrary constants. This is the '''trial''' PI. We can then plug our trial PI into the original equation to solve it fully.

As we will see, we may need to alter this trial PI depending on the CF. If the trial PI contains a term that is also present in the CF, then the PI will be absorbed by the arbitrary constant in the CF, and therefore we will not have a full solution to the problem.

===''f''(''x'') = Constant===

The simplest case is when ''f''(''x'') is constant, for example

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\frac{dy}{dx}-6y=3&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution to the CF is

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{2x}+Be^{-3x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

We now need to find a trial PI. When we differentiate ''y=3'', we get zero. Therefore, our trial PI is the sum of a functions of ''y'' before this, that is, 3 multiplied by an arbitrary constant, which gives another arbitrary constant, K.

We now set ''y'' equal to the PI and find the derivatives up to the order of the DE (here, the second).

::&lt;math&gt;y=K\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

We can now substitute these into the orginal DE:

::&lt;math&gt;0+0-6K=3\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;K=-\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

By summing the CF and the PI, we can get the general solution to the DE:

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{2x}+Be^{-3x}-\frac{1}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===''f''(''x'') = Polynomial===

This is the general method which includes the above example. A polynomial of order ''n'' reduces to 0 in exactly ''n''+1 derivatives (so 1 for a constant as above, three for a quadratic, and so on). So we know that our PI is

::&lt;math&gt;y=C_1x^n+C_2x^{n-1}+...+C_nx+C_{n+1}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

For an example, lets take

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+5\frac{dy}{dx}+6y=3x^4+7x^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

First off, we know that our PI is

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ax^4+Bx^3+Cx^2+Dx+E.\,&lt;/math&gt;

In order to plug in, we need to calculate the first two derivatives of this:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=4Ax^3+3Bx^2+2Cx+D&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=12Ax^2+6Bx+2C\,&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in we get:

::&lt;math&gt;12Ax^2+6Bx+2C+5(4Ax^3+3Bx^2+2Cx+D)+6(Ax^4+Bx^3+Cx^2+Dx+E)=3x^4+7x^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;6Ax^4+(6B+20A)x^3+(6C+15B+12A)x^2+(6D+10C+6B)x+6E+5D+2C=3x^4+7x^2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;6A=3\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;6B+20A=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;6C+15B+12A=7\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(6D+10C+6B)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;6E+5D+2C=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Solving gives us

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;B=\frac{-5}{3}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;C=\frac{13}{3}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;D=\frac{-50}{9}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;E=\frac{86}{27}&lt;/math&gt;

So, our PI is

&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{2}x^4+\frac{-5}{3}x^3+\frac{13}{3}x^2+\frac{-50}{9}x+\frac{86}{27}&lt;/math&gt;

However, we need to get the complementary function as well.  To get that, set ''f''(''x'') to 0 and solve just like we did in the last section.  For this equation, the roots are -3 and -2.  So that makes our CF

&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-3x}+Be^{-2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Summing gives us our general solution:

&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-3x}+Be^{-2x}+\frac{1}{2}x^4-\frac{5}{3}x^3+\frac{13}{3}x^2-\frac{50}{9}x+\frac{86}{27}&lt;/math&gt;

===''f''(''x'') = Power of ''e''===

Powers of ''e'' don't ever reduce to 0, but they do become a pattern.  In fact it does so in only 1 differentiation, since it's its own derivative.  So we know 

&lt;math&gt;y_p=Ke^{px}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where K is our constant and ''p'' is the power of ''e'' givin in the original DE.

For example, consider

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+5\frac{dy}{dx}+6y=5e^{2x}+6e^{-7x}&lt;/math&gt;.

We make our trial PI

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=Ae^{2x}+Be^{-7x} \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Which then gives

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=2Ae^{2x}-7Be^{-7x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=4Ae^{2x}+49Be^{-7x}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in, we get

::&lt;math&gt;4Ae^{2x}+49Be^{-7x}+5\left(2Ae^{2x}-7Be^{-7x}\right)+6\left(Ae^{2x}+Be^{-7x}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:::::&lt;math&gt;=5e^{2x}+6e^{-7x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;20Ae^{2x}+20Be^{-7x}=5e^{2x}+6e^{-7x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;B=\frac{3}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=\frac{1}{4}e^{2x}+\frac{3}{10}e^{-7x}&lt;/math&gt;

That's the particular integral.  We found the CF earlier.  So the general solution is

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-3x}+Be^{-2x}+\frac{1}{4}e^{2x}+\frac{3}{10}e^{-7x} \,&lt;/math&gt;


===''f''(''x'') = Polynomial &amp;times; Power of ''e''===

Polynomials multiplied by powers of ''e'' also form a loop, in ''n'' derivatives (where ''n'' is the highest power of ''x'' in the polynomial).  So we know that our trial PI is

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=C_nx^ne^{px}+C_{n-1}x^{n-1}e^{px}+...+C_0e^{px},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where C is a constant and ''p'' is the power of ''e'' in the equation.

For example, lets try

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+5\frac{dy}{dx}+6y=3xe^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;

We can now set our PI to

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=Axe^{2x}+Be^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy_p}{dx}=2Axe^{2x}+Ae^{2x}+2Be^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y_p}{dx^2}=4Axe^{2x}+4Ae^{2x}+4Be^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in, we get

::&lt;math&gt;4Axe^{2x}+4Ae^{2x}+4Be^{2x}+5(2Axe^{2x}+Ae^{2x}+2Be^{2x})+6(Axe^{2x}+Be^{2x})=3xe^{2x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;20A=3\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;9A+20B=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{3}{20}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;B=\frac{-27}{400}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=\frac{3}{20}xe^{2x}-\frac{27}{400}e^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;

Thats the particular solution.  We found the homogeneous solution earlier.  So the total solution is

&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-3x}+Be^{-2x}+\frac{3}{20}xe^{2x}-\frac{27}{400}e^{2x}&lt;/math&gt;

===''f''(''x'') = Trigonometric Functions===

Trig functions don't reduce to 0 either.  But they do have a loop of  2 derivatives - the derivative of sin ''x'' is cos ''x'', and the derivative of cos ''x'' is -sin ''x''.  So we put our PI as

:&lt;math&gt;y_p=A \sin(px)+B \cos(px), \,&lt;/math&gt;

where C is a constant and ''p'' is the term inside the trig. function in the original DE.

For example, lets try

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+5\frac{dy}{dx}+6y=\cos 3x.&lt;/math&gt;

We set our PI to

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=A \sin 3x+B \cos 3x \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy_p}{dx}=3 A \cos 3x- 3 B \sin 3x&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y_p}{dx^2}=-9A \sin 3x-9B \cos3x&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in, we get

::&lt;math&gt;-9A \sin3x-9B \cos 3x +5 \left( 3A \cos 3x -3B \sin3x \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;+6 \left(A \sin 3x +B \cos 3x \right)=\cos 3x \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;15A-3B=1\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;-3A-15B=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{5}{78}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;B=\frac{-1}{78}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=\frac{5}{78}\sin 3x-\frac{1}{78} \cos 3x&lt;/math&gt;

Thats the particular solution.  We found the homogeneous solution earlier.  So the total solution is

&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{-3x}+Be^{-2x}+\frac{5}{78}\sin 3x-\frac{1}{78} \cos 3x&lt;/math&gt;

===''f''(''x'') =  A Mixture===

Not only are any of the above solvable by the method of undetermined coefficients, so is the sum of one or more of the above.  This is because the sum of two things whose derivatives either go to 0 or loop must also have a derivative that goes to 0 or loops.  The &lt;math&gt;y_p&lt;/math&gt; would be the sum of the individual &lt;math&gt;y_p&lt;/math&gt; functions.

===If the Trial PI shares terms with the CF===

When dealing with &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt;, or sometimes with polynomials (if the homogeneous equation has roots of 0) as ''f''(''x''), you may get the same term in both the trial PI and the CF. If this happens, the PI will be absorbed into the arbitrary constants of the CF, which will not result in a full solution. To overcome this, multiply the affected terms by ''x'' as many times as needed until it no longer appears in the CF.

As an example, let's take

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}+\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=2x.&lt;/math&gt;

First, solve the homogeneous equation to get the CF.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}+\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The auxiliary polynomial is

::&lt;math&gt;m^3+m^2=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

Find the roots of the auxiliary polynomial. In this case, they are

::&lt;math&gt;m=0,\ 0,\ -1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The CF is 

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ae^{0x}+Bxe^{0x}+Ce^{-x}=A+Bx+Ce^{-x}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now for the particular integral.  Since ''f''(''x'') is a polynomial of degree 1, we would normally use A''x''+B.  However, since both a term in ''x'' and a constant appear in the CF, we need to multiply by ''x''² and use

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=Ax^3+Bx^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

We solve this as we normally do for A and B.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy_p}{dx}=3Ax^2+2Bx\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y_p}{dx^2}=6Ax+2B\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3y_p}{dx^3}=6A&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;6A+6Ax+2B=2x\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;6A=2\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;6A+2B=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{3}\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;B=-1\,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y_p=\frac{1}{3}x^3-x^2&lt;/math&gt;

So the total solution is

::&lt;math&gt;y=A+Bx+Ce^{-x}+\frac{1}{3}x^3-x^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Variation of Parameters==

Variation of parameters is a method for finding a particular solution to the equation &lt;math&gt;y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; if the general solution for the corresponding homogeneous equation &lt;math&gt;y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0&lt;/math&gt; is known. We will now derive this general method.

We already know the general solution of the homogenous equation: it is of the form &lt;math&gt;c_1y_1 + c_2y_2&lt;/math&gt;. We will look for a particular solution of the non-homogenous equation of the form &lt;math&gt;\psi = uy_1 + vy_2&lt;/math&gt;, with u and v functions of the independent variable x. Differentiating this we get 

&lt;math&gt;u'y_1+uy_1'+v'y_2+vy_2'\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now notice that there is currently only one condition on &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, namely that &lt;math&gt;\psi'' + p(x)\psi' + q(x)\psi = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We now impose another condition, that

&lt;math&gt;u'y_1+v'y_2=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that &lt;math&gt;\psi''&lt;/math&gt; will have no second derivatives of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, these new parameters (hence the name &quot;variation of parameters&quot;) will be the solutions to some first order differential equation, which can be solved. Let us finish the problem:

&lt;math&gt;\psi'' = u'y_1' + uy_1'' + v'y_2' + vy_2''\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\psi'' + p(x)\psi' + q(x)\psi = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u'y_1' + v'y_2' + uy_1'' + vy_2'' + p(x)(uy_1' + vy_2') + q(x)(uy_1 + vy_2) = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u'y_1' + v'y_2' + u(y_1'' + p(x)y_1' + q(x)y_1) + v(y_2'' + p(x)y_2' + q(x)y_2) = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u'y_1' + v'y_2' = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the last step follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are solutions of the homogeneous equation.

Therefore, we have &lt;math&gt;u'y_1 + v'y_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u'y_1' + v'y_2' = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying the first equation by &lt;math&gt;y_2'&lt;/math&gt; and the second by &lt;math&gt;-y_2&lt;/math&gt; and adding gives

&lt;math&gt;u'y_1y_2' - u'y_1'y_2 = -f(x)y_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u' = {-f(x)y_2 \over y_1y_2'-y_1'y_2}&lt;/math&gt;

A similar procedure gives

&lt;math&gt;v' = {f(x)y_1 \over y_1y_2'-y_1'y_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now it is only necessary to evaluate these expressions and integrate them with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to get the functions &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and then we have our particular solution &lt;math&gt;\psi = uy_1 + vy_2&lt;/math&gt;. The general solution to the differential equation &lt;math&gt;y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + uy_1 + vy_2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the main difficulty with this method is that the integrals involved are often extremely complicated. If the integral does not work out well, it is best to use the method of undetermined coefficients instead.

The quantity that appears in the denominator of the expressions for &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v'&lt;/math&gt; is called the Wronskian of &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt;.


==Laplace Transforms ==

The Laplace transform is a very useful tool for solving nonhomogenous initial-value problems. It allows us to reduce the problem of solving the differential equation to that of solving an algebraic equation. We begin with some setup.

===Definition of the Laplace Transform ===

The Laplace transform of &lt;math&gt;f(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as 

&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \int _0^\infty f(t)e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt;. 

This can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;. When writing this on paper, you may write a cursive capital &quot;L&quot; and it will be generally understood. There is also an inverse Laplace transform &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{F(s)\} = f(t)&lt;/math&gt;, but calculating it requires an integration with respect to a complex variable. Luckily, it is frequently possible to find &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{F(s)\}&lt;/math&gt; without resorting to this integration, using a variety of tricks which will be described later. However, it is first necessary to prove some facts about the Laplace transform.

===Two Properties of the Laplace Transform ===

''Property 1.'' The Laplace transform is a linear operator; that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{c_1f(t) + c_2g(t)\} = c_1\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} + c_2\mathcal{L}\{g(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The proof of this property follows immediately from the definition of the Laplace transform and is left to the reader.
''Property 2.'' If &lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f'(t)\} = sF(s) - f(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:Proof:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f'(t)\} = \int _0^\infty f'(t)e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{C\to\infty} \left.e^{-st}f(t) \right| _0^C - \int _0^C -sf(t)e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt; (integrating by parts)
::&lt;math&gt;= -f(0) +  s \lim_{C\to\infty}\int _0^C f(t)e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= s\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} - f(0)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= sF(s) - f(0)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is property 2 that makes the Laplace transform a useful tool for solving differential equations. As a corollary of property 2, note that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f''(t)\} = s^2F(s) - sf(0) - f'(0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Laplace Transforms of Simple Functions ===
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{1\} = {1 \over s}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{e^{at}\} = {1 \over s-a}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{\cos \omega t\} = {s \over s^2 + \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{\sin \omega t\} = {\omega \over s^2 + \omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The last two can be easily calculated using Euler's formula &lt;math&gt;e^{i\omega t} = \cos \omega t + i \sin \omega t\,&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to find more Laplace transforms, in particular the transform of &lt;math&gt;t^n&lt;/math&gt;, we will derive two more properties of the transform.

===Two More Properties of the Laplace Transform===
''Property 3.'' If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{tf(t)\} = -F'(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Property 4.'' If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = F(s)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{e^{at}f(t)\} = F(s-a)&lt;/math&gt;.
:The proofs are straightforward and are left to the reader.

Now we can easily see that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{t\} = \mathcal{L}\{(t)(1)\} = -{d \over dt}\mathcal{L}\{1\} = {1 \over s^2}&lt;/math&gt;
. Applying Property 3 multiple times, we can find that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = {n! \over s^{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt;. At last we are ready to solve a differential equation using Laplace transforms.

===Using Laplace Transforms to Solve Non-Homogeneous Initial-Value Problems ===
In general, we solve a second-order linear non-homogeneous initial-value problem as follows: First, we take the Laplace transform of both sides. This immediately reduces the differential equation to an algebraic one. We then solve for &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, we take the inverse transform of both sides to find &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's begin by using this technique to solve the problem 

:&lt;math&gt;y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{-t}; y(0) = 0, y'(0) = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;.

We begin by taking the Laplace transform of both sides and using property 1 (linearity):

:&lt;math&gt;s^2F(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) - 4[sF(s) - y(0)] + 3F(s) = {1 \over s+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(s^2-4s+3)F(s) - 1 = {1 \over s+1}&lt;/math&gt; (using the initial conditions)

Now we isolate &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = {1 \over (s-3)(s-1)} + {1 \over (s-3)(s-1)(s+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we have factored &lt;math&gt;s^2 - 4s + 3&lt;/math&gt; in preparation for the next step. We now attempt to take the inverse transform of both sides; in order to do this, we will have to break down the right hand side into partial fractions.

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = {A \over (s-3)} + {B \over (s-1)} + {C \over (s-3)} + {D \over (s+1)} + {E \over (s-1)}&lt;/math&gt;

The first two fractions imply that &lt;math&gt;A(s-1) + B(s-3) = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. Setting &lt;math&gt;s=3&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;A = {1 \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, while setting &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;B = -{1 \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;. The other three fractions similarly give &lt;math&gt;C = D = {1 \over 8}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E = -{1 \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = {1 \over 2(s-3)} - {1 \over 2(s-1)} + {1 \over 8(s-3)} + {1 \over 8(s+1)} - {1 \over 4(s-1)}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= {5 \over 8(s-3)} - {3 \over 4(s-1)} + {1 \over 8(s+1)}&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;= {5 \over 8}\mathcal{L}\{e^{3t}\} - {3 \over 4}\mathcal{L}\{e^t\} + {1 \over 8}\mathcal{L}\{e^{-t}\}&lt;/math&gt;

And finally we can take the inverse transform (by inspection, of course) to get

&lt;math&gt;y = {5 \over 8}e^{3t} - {3 \over 4}e^t + {1 \over 8}e^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Convolution ===

The convolution is a method of combining two functions to yield a third function. The convolution has applications in probability, statistics, and many other fields because it represents the &quot;overlap&quot; between the functions. We are not concerned with this property here; for us the convolution is useful as a quick method for calculating inverse Laplace transforms.

''Definition.'' The convolution &lt;math&gt;(f*g)(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t f(u)g(t-u)du&lt;/math&gt;.

The convolution has several useful properties, which are stated below:

''Property 1.'' &lt;math&gt;((f*g)*h)(t) = (f*(g*h))(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; (Associativity)

''Property 2.'' &lt;math&gt;(f*g)(t) = (g*f)(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; (Commutativity)

''Property 3.'' &lt;math&gt;(f*(g+h))(t) = (f*g)(t) + (f*h)(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; (Distribution over addition)

We now prove the result that makes the convolution useful for calculating inverse Laplace transforms.

''Theorem.'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{(f*g)(t)\} = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} \cdot \mathcal{L}\{g(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;

:Proof:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\{(f*g)(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty (f*g)(t)e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty \left[\int_0^t f(u)g(t-u)du \right]e^{-st}dt&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty \int_0^t e^{-st}f(u)g(t-u)du\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty \int_u^\infty e^{-st}f(u)g(t-u)dt\,du&lt;/math&gt; (changing order of integration)
::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty f(u)\left[ \int_u^\infty e^{-st}g(t-u)dt\right]du&lt;/math&gt;

::Now let &lt;math&gt;v=t-u&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty f(u) \left[ \int_0^\infty e^{-s(u+v)}g(v)dv\right]du&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\int_0^\infty e^{-su}f(u)\left[\int_0^\infty e^{-sv}g(v)dv\right]du&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} \cdot \mathcal{L}\{g(t)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Let's solve another differential equation:

&lt;math&gt;y'' + y = \sin t\, ; y(0) = 0, y'(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Taking Laplace transforms of both sides gives

:&lt;math&gt;s^2F(s) + F(s) = {1 \over s^2 + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = {1 \over (s^2 + 1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We now have to find &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^{-1}\lbrace F(s)\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, we notice that &lt;math&gt;{1 \over (s^2 + 1)^2} = [\mathcal{L}\{\sin t\}]^2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{ \sin t * \sin t \}&lt;/math&gt; by the Theorem above. Thus, the solution to our differential equation is the convolution of sine with itself. We proceed to calculate this:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin t * \sin t\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \int_0^t \sin(u) \sin(t-u)du&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \int_0^t {\cos(2u-t) - \cos(t) \over 2}du&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= {1 \over 2} \sin t - {1 \over 2} t \cos t&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the solution to the original equation is

&lt;math&gt;y = {1 \over 2} \sin t - {1 \over 2} t \cos t&lt;/math&gt;.

I am a native speaker of Cantonese. I feel a bit strange about the sentence &quot;我既名系大伟&quot;. It's OK if the sentence is said by a child, but a little stupid for an adult(有D傻). Maybe it's affected the the English sentence &quot;my name is ...&quot;. I suggest just using &quot;我叫...&quot; or &quot;我系...&quot; instead.

Why don't you correct it yourself then?
You can't for some reason, I guess?
I'll try.

Nowadays, 乜嘢 is pronounced as one sound mae. I'm not sure if the phonetics are correct, so, I'm posting it here. --'''''&amp;nbsp;[[User:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:150%;color:#00FF00&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Hayson1991|&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:125%;color:#00CC00&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;font color=&quot;#AAAAAA&quot;&gt;YSON&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;1991&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''''' 04:01, 23 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Emma. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Emma~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==About Me==
I am more active at Wikipedia.
I am new to the Wiki.
I sail.
I am a parent, a spouse, and a scientist.
Here are my areas of expertise:
* PhD in Chemical Physics -- thesis on Quantum Chemistry
* Basic Knot-tying
* Sailing (10 years day-sailing on the Chesapeake)

==I have been working on==
*[[Wikijunior Solar System]] -- Some fact-checking, but mostly making it easier to read for 8 to 11 year-olds.

==About Wikijunior==
* [[Meta:Wikijunior|Wikijunior Main Page]] Says &quot;the Beck Foundation approached the Wikimedia Foundation&quot; ([[meta:WQ/2/grants|slight details]]), and that &quot;The website that is accessible to kids will not be identical to the website accessible to contributors. That will avoid having kids who are just trying to do their homework get caught up in flame wars, personal attacks, and other assorted nonsense (you know exactly what I mean). &quot;  This would be a GREAT idea.  So far, there is no division between &quot;working area&quot; and &quot;fit to be seen by kids&quot; area.

* [[Meta:Wikijunior/proposal_to_Beck_Foundation|About the Proposal]], which was prepared by [[Meta:User:Danny|Danny Wool]].  He has a [[Meta:User:Danny/Grants|Grants Q&amp;A page]].
* [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Benefactors#October_2004 Announcement of Wikijunior grant from Beck Foundation]
* [[User:Angela|Angela]] confirms that the [http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:-CbA3epNgucJ:www.thebeckfoundation.org/+and+site:thebeckfoundation.org&amp;hl=en The John and Frances Beck Foundation of Chicago] has funded this project
====The John and Frances Beck Foundation====
&lt;i&gt;from http://becklit.org/beck.php, as of [[October 05]][[2005]]&lt;/i&gt;
=====About The Beck Foundation=====
The purpose of the Beck Foundation is to initiate and support projects that effectively promote literacy and learning among children youth, and adults. To accomplish this purpose, the Foundation provides financial assistance to registered not for profit cultural, educational, religious institutions, and individuals who use the Educational Practices Booklets of the International Bureau of Education for teacher training and for those who provide free downloadable reading material. 

We are interested in exploring projects that are capable of efficiently reaching thousands of school age children and their teachers through the use of technology and non-traditional learning settings.

=====John and Frances Beck=====
John and Frances Beck had long careers in the field of teacher education. Their lifelong efforts were devoted to assisting teachers, tutors, and parents in the field of reading and language development. Their Foundation reflects those efforts by providing, through the internet, free, downloadable learning material: stories, books, and lesson plans, suitable for children and students from preschool through grade 9. 

=====Contacting the Beck Foundation=====
&lt;i&gt;from http://thebeckfoundation.org, which now seems to be defunct.  According to Google's [[July 20]][[2005]] cache, it used to say&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Computers are able to defeat even expert human Classical Chess players, partly because of their reliance on a database of openings. Fischer Random Chess is one alternative; however, computers will soon have a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960%40Home strong database] of openings for all 960 possible starting positions. Random Opening Chess is a chess variant in which it is not possible to compile a database of openings, because there are too many possibilities, even for computers. Random Opening Chess includes all the charm of Classical Chess, save for the openings.

On the diagram at the right you can see one of the possible setups, likely set by experienced chess players with a feeling for the harmony of chess. However, you can also create much more wild and unique opening positions possible only in Random Opening Chess. Note that in this setup, both players are able to castle on both sides.

Random Opening Chess is a chess variant. It is based on Classical [[Wikipedia:Chess|Chess]], but has some similarities with Problem Chess and Go.

There are not many differences in the rules, you will still enjoy Random Opening Chess if you like the beauty of Classical Chess. In Random Opening Chess you use the same chess board, the same chess pieces and even the same rules as in Classical Chess. The only difference is the starting positions. A game of Random Opening Chess starts with an empty chess board.

The rules are simple. First set up an empty chess board as in Classical Chess, with a white square on the bottom right. Game play starts with white pieces. White Player puts one white piece on the empty chess board. He can choose any white piece.
 
* If he chooses pawn, he can put it on any square in the second, third or fourth row.
* If he chooses any other piece than a pawn (knight, bishop, rook, queen or king) he can put it on any square on the board.

Then it's black's turn. He can put his first piece on any empty square on the board.

* If he chooses pawn, he can put it on any free square in the fifth, sixth or seventh row.
* If he chooses any other piece than a pawn (knight, bishop, rook, queen or king) he can put it on any free square on the board.
* If the opposite king is already on the board, he is not allowed to attack it.
* He is not allowed to put his own king under attack.

Play continues with players alternating setting pieces. After all 32 pieces are set, the game continues as with the Classical Chess rules.

Note that:

* Bishops must be set on opposite colored squares.
* You can [[Wikipedia:Castling|castle]] if the kings and rooks are in proper position and they didn't move (As per Classical Chess rules.)
* You can also use the [[Wikipedia:En passant|en-passant]] rule if positioning allows it.

== General Overview ==

At the time of his departure from Hogwarts, after a falling out with the other three founders of the school, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] is supposed to have created a chamber, placed a monster within it, and sealed it so that only his true heir could open it. In the centuries since that time, this &quot;chamber of secrets&quot; has been sought many times, but never found.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Chamber was in fact opened, approximately fifty years before the time of the Harry Potter series, by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]] (who later styled himself as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]). At that time, the monster within the Chamber, a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|basilisk]], killed a girl ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]); this put the school on the verge of closing down, because it was obviously unsafe to keep students there. The threat of being forced to leave the school was sufficient to cause Riddle to re-seal the chamber. Riddle was as fond of his &quot;home&quot; as Harry was. Riddle managed to frame [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] as being the Heir and the monster respectively; as the Chamber was not then re-opened, and no more victims fell to the basilisk, Riddle's version of events became accepted as fact by all except, perhaps, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]].

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] second year, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] re-opened the Chamber; however, it was not on her own that she did this. We find out in the last chapters of the book that Ginny was at the time enslaved by a &quot;memory&quot; of Tom Riddle. Ginny re-opens the chamber on six occasions that we are aware of.
* When Harry is serving his detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]], he hears the voice of the basilisk.
* On Hallowe'en, as Harry is leaving the Deathday Party, he hears the Basilisk again. Following the sound, he encounters the Petrified [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]].
* When Harry is in the Hospital Wing following the removal of the bones in his arm by Professor Lockhart, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]] is brought in to the Hospital Wing, Petrified.
* Harry trips over the Petrified [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and blackened [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] shortly after leaving the library, where he had been met with severe suspicion.
* On his way to a Quidditch match, Harry hears the voice of the basilisk again, which prompts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] to head off to the library to research something. Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]] are Petrified as they leave the library.
* Tom Riddle has Ginny enter the Chamber herself so that he may use her life force to re-animate himself.

Harry's final re-opening of the Chamber and defeat of the basilisk should have cleared Hagrid's name; it did secure his release from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], where he had been consigned when it was thought that he was once again opening the Chamber.

The key to opening the Chamber is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]]; one must say &quot;open&quot; to the entrance in Parseltongue for it to open. The ability to speak to snakes has been linked to Slytherin's descendants, thus the belief that only the true heir of Slytherin can open the Chamber.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] re-enter the chamber in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Harry's seventh year]]; knowing that Basilisk venom will destroy a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], and having a Horcrux they need to destroy, Ron, who has twice now heard Harry pronounce the word &quot;open&quot; in Parseltongue, opens the Chamber by imitating the sound of the word. When Harry sees them, they are carrying the destroyed Horcrux and a great stock of Basilisk fangs.

According to J. K. Rowling's instructions to the film-makers for Chamber of Secrets, the chamber itself is located under the lake on the Hogwarts grounds. (Source: Interview with the filmmakers on the extended features of the DVD release.)

== Analysis ==

We mentioned above that it seemed that Professor Dumbledore had apparently had his doubts about whether Hagrid had been the one who opened the Chamber. We see these doubts expressed shortly after Colin Creevey is brought into the Hospital Wing. In conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], after examining Colin's destroyed camera, Dumbledore states that the Chamber has been opened once again. We are never told how he reached this conclusion, but it is a safe guess that something similar to the damage to Colin's camera had happened when the Chamber had been opened fifty years earlier. We note that while Dumbledore may recognize the effects, he likely does not yet know the cause. Professor McGonagall asks who has opened the chamber, to which Dumbledore responds that the question is not &quot;who,&quot; but &quot;how.&quot; Dumbledore does not, apparently, know where the Chamber is or how it was opened, but has come to the conclusion, either upon seeing the writing or at some earlier date, that the legend, that says the Chamber can only be opened by the true heir of Slytherin, is fact. He has also decided, possibly tentatively, that Riddle is that heir. The remaining soul of Riddle, now known as Voldemort, is believed to be in Albania, but Dumbledore knows that Voldemort's soul can ride on other people, as happened in the previous year with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]. Dumbledore's concern at this point is that there may be someone else, a student or teacher, who has, like Quirrell, fallen under Voldemort's spell. Dumbledore may also believe that there is some other denizen of the school who is able to open the Chamber, but that seems less likely.

A key point in this book is the ability to speak to snakes. Parseltongue is widely believed to be a marker of Slytherin forebears. As a result, Harry is believed to be an heir of Slytherin once it is revealed that he can speak to snakes. This is exacerbated by the fact that Harry is unsure of his ancestry; he cannot ask his parents if there is any chance he was descended from Salazar Slytherin. However, as Parseltongue is assumed to be a hereditary Slytherin ability, it only makes sense that the Chamber created by Slytherin would open when addressed in Parseltongue.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# We are told that Salazar Slytherin lived a thousand years or so ago, and presumably created the chamber then. While castles of the era did have interior toilets (&quot;garderobes&quot;) in the Muggle world, indoor plumbing first appeared in England barely two hundred years ago. Suggest a reason that the mark of Slytherin, that opened the passage to the Chamber, could have been placed on a faucet.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

As mentioned, only a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parselmouth|Parselmouth]] can open the Chamber, and it is widely believed that the ability to speak Parseltongue is only passed to the heirs of Slytherin. As an heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle could certainly be expected to speak Parseltongue, and so he is able to open the Chamber. Harry, with a piece of Tom's soul, is equally able to speak the language, and apparently Dumbledore has learned it, although Dumbledore did not try to find the Chamber. One must wonder why he did not; as a teacher at the school the first time the Chamber was opened, he must have had all the clues that Harry was working with. Perhaps he did not learn Parseltongue until much later in his life, and time had made the need to find the Chamber less pressing.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] later managed to open the Chamber; in need of something to destroy the cup [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], they visited the Chamber to retrieve some Basilisk fangs, which apparently still had sufficient venom to destroy the Horcrux. Ron had been present at Harry's initial opening of the Chamber, and when Harry opened the locket Horcrux, another artifact of Slytherin's which would open only when addressed in Parseltongue, and simply parroted the sounds Harry had made to open the locket, in order to open the Chamber.

== General Overview ==

The house at '''''Spinner's End''''', a gloomy house with a book-lined parlour, is the home of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this house when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], followed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], her sister, visit Snape in an attempt to get Snape's promise that he will help Narcissa's son [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] with the mission that has been set for him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord]]. We find Snape in residence, along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], who has been sent to Spinner's End to assist Snape, and is most annoyed that Snape treats him as a servant. Pettigrew does try to listen in on their conversation, but Snape, knowing he is there, fires a spell through the bookcase and into the secret staircase where Pettigrew is hiding, sending him away.

We later find out that Snape is not the only character from the books in this particular down-at-its-heels mill town. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we learn that Snape had been friends with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]] (who later became [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] mother), and had known [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia Evans]] (Harry's Aunt Petunia) as well.

== Analysis ==

We never learn much beyond the fact that Spinners' End is overshadowed by a large factory smoke stack, and that the entire neighbourhood is very run-down. From Snape's memories in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], we learn that Snape grew up in an impoverished family; the descriptions of this, his childhood home, seem to be of a piece with this. It is uncertain whether Snape's childhood home was planned out in any detail before we are first introduced to it in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', as it could have been as easily sketched in to fit Snape's character, as his character could have been designed in part to have sprung out of this background.

[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-spinners-end.html One fan site] has put together a reasonably compelling argument that Spinner's End is actually located in the north of England, near Manchester. Factors contributing to this argument are the winding river (suggesting plains), the fact that the river is polluted and evidently has a tow path or similar flat area alongside, stated distance from London, lack of gentrification, cobblestone streets, and brick terraced houses. They further point to Snape's word use (describing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] as &quot;smelly&quot;, and use of the term &quot;dunderhead&quot;), and his abrasive character as being characteristic of the North, where rudeness, called &quot;being blunt&quot; is considered a sign of honsety.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is uncertain how completely Snape's childhood was defined when the first few books were written. We do know that Snape's childhood was mapped out to some extent as early as the start of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], as Petunia refers then to a conversation that she had with Snape; and we believe that it had been planned, to some extent, even earlier than that, as the relationship between Lily and Snape is a critical part of Snape's personality and relationship with Harry in particular, and Gryffindor House in general. While it is clear that Snape and the Evans family must have lived in the same town, given Snape's early and unrequited love for Lily, we cannot know when the environs of Spinners' End were finalized; it is, however, reasonable to guess that Snape's character would have to be at least partly shaped by poverty, which would require that the necessary frame for Spinners' End be in place from the beginning of the series.

If anyone wants to record their language exchanges and/or post the exchanges to a blog I'd check out Pamela.  Bundles with skype, so you can just set it so that a box pops up asking if you want to record the session.  Also automatically warns the other party through a text message that the session is being recorded.  Let me know too if anyone else is skypecasting these exchanges.  I'd be curious as to how other people are structuring the class etc.

== Social Networking ==

Social Networking websites such as MySpace, Facebook, Xanga, Sconex, Bebo and Tagged (all mentioned in the U.S. News &amp; World Report article on MySpace in the 18 September 2006 issue) appear to be an interesting venue for interacting in English, although I have little personal familiarithy with these sites.

Do similar sites exist in other languages? How do they work for someone who is a L2 speaker? Can we get lists of similar Social Networking sites in other languages? Do they all just use aynchronous text?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just what does the human mind do when it thinks? Here we must conjecture a little.

Thinking seems to occur on several levels. (The term “level” will be used to distinguish one kind of mental activity from another.&lt;ref&gt;It may help some to use the word “consciousness” instead of the word “thinking” when reading this section. I have chosen to use “thinking” because I wish to emphasize differences (“levels” of thinking) that are harder to separate when using the word “consciousness.” (Consciousness is further, although briefly, discussed in a postscript to this chapter, [[../../Consciousness And Conscience|Consciousness And Conscience]].)&lt;/ref&gt; These thinking activities overlap, and are not actually separate and distinct. They could be described as different &quot;modes of thought,” but separating the process into three “levels” aids explanation.) 

Before we begin, let us distinguish what happens autonomically&amp;mdash;the brain’s control of body functions mentioned in section one. As has been stated, what the brain does reflexively is not really considered to be thinking. For example when confronting danger, the body prepares for '''flight or fight''' - the pulse races, the lungs ventilate,  the digestion is suspended, the stomach and bowels may be emptied (hence such expressions as sick with worry and frightened shitless). 

These emotional responses are fast and dirty survival mechanisms. Except insofar as they affect mood and thus rational thinking we will mostly ignore this kind of uncontrollable activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In what will be called the “first level” of thinking, the brain simply absorbs information from its sensors (predominantly the eyes, and then the ears for humans). First-level thought amounts to little more than a general awareness of one’s surroundings. Cassirer writes about this mental activity as follows. “In the realm of mythic conception” . . . (which preceded the use of words and language) . . . “thought does not confront its data in an attitude of free contemplation, seeking to understand their structure and their systematic connections, and analyzing them according to their parts and functions, but is simply captivated by a total impression. Such thinking does not develop the given content of experience; it does not reach backward or forward from that vantage point to find ‘causes’ and ‘effects,’ but rests content with taking in the sheer existent.”&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, ''Language and Myth'', translated by Susanne K. Langer (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1953), 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals, certainly, have this ability. Most mammals mainly comprehend their environment visually, as we do, but many obtain the same kind of awareness predominantly through a different sense—that which has become their most highly developed one. Bats, we know, rely upon their ears, much more than their eyes, to build instantaneous mental pattern-pictures of their surroundings. Dogs are likely to develop odour maps of their territory.

First-level thinking is restricted to this kind of activity; the mental equivalent of simply displaying information within the brain. It exists only as temporary neural ion flows that form patterns, none of which become associated with previously stored patterns, for memories are not needed to generate this kind of awareness. These experiences never (unless linked to other memories during subsequent second-level thinking activities and recalled as an impression of some kind) form part of any permanent memory.&lt;ref&gt;Savants (see later) are likely exceptions to this generalization; many explanations of their exceptional capabilities depend upon their being able to access an almost perfect memory of things seen or heard.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is predominately located in a specific area of the brain, a sensory strip along the top center of your brain. Others forms of worldly awareness may exist however, much like earthworms response to light or even a venus-fly-trap's response to touching it's hairs, all transmitted chemically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Second-level thinking occurs in two forms, subconscious and conscious. It is defined to be occurring when the mind discovers meaningful associations between stored memories (i.e., earlier-formed, data-storing, neural networks) and incoming information, between two or more sets of incoming data, or between stored memories.&lt;ref&gt;It also occurs as a stress-relieving activity, as will be discussed later.&lt;/ref&gt; Second-level thinking happens continuously at the subconscious level and intermittently at the conscious level. (This implies that subconscious thought precedes conscious thought, a phenomenon that brain-scanning has verified. We will refer to this again, in [[../../Revelations And Conversions/]].)

Scanning incoming data for relevancy and significance is second-level thinking’s most important function. A living entity’s most relevant and important concern is almost always survival (resulting in a constant search for active threats or potential danger,&lt;ref&gt;This is why information from the eyes is first routed to pass through networks that check for changes&amp;mdash;see [[../../The Brain#cite_note-8|The Brain, footnote 9]].&lt;/ref&gt; and for food and water). Its second most relevant and important concern is the possible opportunity to reproduce. The nature of this kind of thinking means that information is almost always stored in conjunction with emotional overtones.&lt;ref&gt;Penfield, more than seventy years ago, noted that electrically stimulating tiny areas of the temporal lobes of a patient produced sensations of different smells, accompanied by associated memories and feelings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all subconscious second-level thinking is immediately discarded (as most habitat environments are benign and otherwise not of much significance). When meaningful relationships between incoming data and stored memories are found, they may trigger body reactions (such as danger-avoiding activity) and may break through from the subconscious into the conscious mind, where they are further considered.&lt;ref&gt;Stimuli propagate in two ways: as electrically charged ions, which flow along and between neurons; and as chemical discharges (e.g., the release of adrenaline or endorphin) which move about in body fluids. Neural transmissions are relatively fast, and some of them may give rise to feelings (e.g., pain). Chemical transmissions are relatively slow to act and take longer to fade; they may give rise to the longer-lasting emotions (e.g., happiness).
Emotional responses are considered to be inherited from ancient learned responses. Animals employing such devices have inherited them from ancestors who first developed these as solutions to survival or reproductive threats. Thus human males react emotionally (particularly in early adulthood) to other males entering their territory or attempting to usurp females. Overt emotional displays act as warnings, and may obviate the need to use potentially self-harmful force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a well-organized and informative discussion of the mind’s psychological development and functioning, see David M. Buss, ''Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, animals make these associations and comparisons (continually at the subconscious level, and periodically, with varying degrees of ability, at the conscious level). Animals generally ignore non-threatening events but react to potential danger situations, demonstrating that they know from past experience or instinct (remembering the gosling experiment) how to distinguish one from the other.

(Animals can do more than simply react to situations; they can plan ahead, using a knowledge of prevailing circumstances—social as well as situational. Dunbar [after describing how an old, ousted, male chimpanzee used rewards and punishments to manipulate an alliance with a weak young chimpanzee and so regain and retain control of a harem from its new, stronger leader] concluded that the behaviour of monkeys and apes showed that they can predict the outcome of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Dunbar, ''Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1996), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Associating memories and/or stimuli in meaningful ways forms the basis of second-level thinking; language is certainly not needed to make such neural network linkages. Infants demonstrate that they can make associations and comparisons long before they can speak; for example, they react with surprise if some aspect of a frequently observed image has been changed.

The critical aspects that distinguish second-level thinking from first-level thinking are that, during second-level thinking, two or more sets of information are compared, differences are noted, and the relevance of any found variance is sought. The degree to which any detected difference is understood depends upon the sophistication of the animal—its evolutionary level, past experiences, education and intelligence. Simple animals may understand little about any discovered differences; humans may understand much.

The discovered relationship may, as previously noted, be immediately discounted and forgotten. However, those deemed to be significant may become stored as part of a new neural network if one or more links are forged between pre-existing patterns. The simple example that follows might clarify this important process.

Imagine that I want to drill a hole through a block of wood, and that I have the required drill but the drill bits are too short. What would I do? Well, I would look around to see what I had that might be long enough. When this first happened to me, it took a little while to think of cutting the head from a long nail then using the nail. However, the second time this occurred, I quickly remembered my previous solution.

The first situation above entailed second-level thought, the second occurrence did not. In the first situation, my mind had to mentally list the properties a useful bit must possess (strength, hardness, rigidity, length and so on) then cause me to seek something that possessed such properties. The two data sets (the neural network patterns that stored information about what was required, and the streams of data coming from my eyes as I looked over my workshop) were compared, and matches that denoted relevance to the problem induced temporary ion-flow loops between corresponding aspects. Once a solution was found, once I had spotted a nail and realized that it would serve my purpose, the temporary links&lt;ref&gt;Temporary ion-flow loop formation is similar to storing data in random access memory (RAM) in computers; this information is retained only as long as its supporting medium is energized. Permanent link storage, on the other hand, is similar to storing data on a computer’s hard disk, where it remains even after the power is switched off. (This suggests that it may be possible, one day, to retrieve the long term memories stored in a “dead” brain.)&lt;/ref&gt; that were significant were retained long enough to be made permanent through the growth of synaptic knobs, thus becoming available for future use as part of my neural network complex. Linking and learning turn out to be the same thing.

Simply remembering something done, heard, seen or read about is not second-level thinking, it is merely reactivating previously formed neural paths. No new links are made, and nothing new is learned during simple recall.&lt;ref&gt;However, additional synaptic knobs may form, lessening the neural pathway’s resistance to future ion flows and thus somewhat increasing the probability that this path will be chosen above neighbouring others.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, recalling memories to mind is similar to looking at a picture or running a movie in one’s head, whereas second-level thinking is more akin to looking at two pictures or running two movies side-by-side, while constantly comparing and contrasting the two.

Infants, with brains containing well over 100 billion neurons, make neural links continuously as they attempt to join sensory stimuli with information that is stored in memory.&lt;ref&gt;The brain enlarges rapidly in volume, from about 350 cc (cubic centimetres) at birth to double that at six months, doubling again to approximately adult size (some 1400 cc) at four years old. (See Susan Greenfield, ''The Human Brain: A Guided Tour'' [New York: Basic Books, 1997].) Dendrites form most rapidly after this neuronal growth has occurred—from four to ten years of age. The majority of association-forming neural connections are made during these early years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Newborns and very young infants initially experience stimuli devoid of context. Stimuli produce feelings and emotions—pleasure, pain, satisfaction, rejection, joy, anger, and so on—with initially no understanding that a link between stimuli and emotion, or between past cause and future effect, exists. Understanding only begins to arrive after experiences have become stored as memories, when neural links between them, or between them and new stimuli, can be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Although the retrieval and use of some of the information already held in the mind is often under rational control, the storage of information coming to our brains from our body’s sensors is usually not. However, when we want to sure we will remember something of importance, we can consciously direct our minds in the way it stores thoughts. Thus, for example, as a reminder to telephone Bill early tomorrow, we can picture ourselves drinking a breakfast mug of coffee, then picking up the phone. The next morning this task comes to mind while coffee drinking, just as desired. We remember to call because we have associated or linked it to another action, an action that needs no reminder to occur. Mnemonics, used in memory training, employ the same trick.)&lt;/ref&gt; Infants and young children learn quickly and easily, because stimuli are being stored and linked on a more-or-less “tabula rasa” (a term meaning “blank slate,” first used by John Locke in 1690 in his ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' to describe the mind of a newborn). That many of these associations will turn out to be incorrect and unusable is inconsequential; the links that matter are the ones that are subsequently reinforced through use. Billions of early made connections remain unused throughout all our lives, slowly atrophying. Christian de Duve pointed out&lt;ref&gt;Christian de Duve, ''Vital Dust: Life as a Cosmic Imperative'' (New York: Basic Books, 1995), 241.&lt;/ref&gt; that neurons initially make many loose connections; these are strengthened only if useful, and are discarded if not. The associations that are used, of course, are those connecting memories that, by being linked, provide useful understandings: the name of a toy, object or a sibling; the idea that certain results always follow certain activities (things fall to the ground when released, for instance); how to call for food, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Memory-building in infants must progress from knowing nothing, to becoming vaguely aware of a shape, noise, or other sensation, then on to storing this as an unrecognized neural pattern that seems to have some significance. Subsequent detection of similar stimuli, because it is of a comparable nature, follows the now-existing neural pathway and thus reaches the first neural patterns stored. Any extra information brought in by the new stimuli may then be stored as additional neural patterns linked to (i.e., associated with) the earlier stored patterns. In this way, memories slowly build in complexity and data completeness, until they become what adolescents and adults experience—full-blown mental representations of objects and events that have existed (or exist) in the outside world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(It is because many repetitions of an event must occur before it can be meaningfully linked to create an understanding, that fully one-third of all blind-from-birth adults, whose ability to see has abruptly been restored, revert initially to closing their eyes to navigate and generally make sense of the world.)&lt;/ref&gt; Adults learn more slowly, because their minds first attempt to fit new stimuli into previously existing networks, and only when this can’t be done do they progress to looking for, then forming, completely new links. In other words, adults do not immediately think when reacting to a stimulus; they first search, very rapidly and almost entirely subconsciously, for past associations and use them, whenever the fit seems close enough.

Realizing that second-level thinking is little more than electrochemically comparing memories with incoming data (or comparing memories already in storage), recognizing relationships of significance between them, then making new neural links, tells us again that this kind of thinking cannot be unique to humankind. The brains of many animals do this.&lt;ref&gt;We must again differentiate between simply recalling memories and second-level thought. The example of European blue tits all over England opening tinfoil caps on milk bottles to obtain the cream is widely known. But only the first bird to discover this was “thinking”; the others simply copied what they saw another bird do. (The first bird associated or linked memories of cream at the top of bottles and memories of pecking to make holes; it was “thinking.” Birds copying this behaviour were simply demonstrating “learned” behaviour, or memory recall, not original thinking.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A related observation involves Imo, a macaque monkey, who discovered the benefits of washing sweet potatoes in the sea before eating them. This could have been due to second-level thinking (for instance, if Imo had associated memories of eating sweet potatoes found in the sea and sensory perceptions that these potatoes lacked grit or were saltier, etc., and were more enjoyable to eat). The many other macaques who later adopted this practice did so because they had seen and memorized, then recalled and imitated, what Imo did. Thinking was not involved in these subsequent behaviours. (Similarly, much of what any animal does, including humans, does not require conscious thought.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Note that each of these behaviours have come into common use, and thus might be considered to have become part of the animal’s culture, to be passed through repetition from generation to generation, and to die out when their practice is recognized as being no longer beneficial. Human cultures build in exactly the same way.)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, we should expect linkages to form between memories and incoming sensory stimulations in all animate entities, because sense receptor cells and neurons exist to provide information so that similarities and differences between incoming and stored memories can be detected. Animals and humans learn what these variations may imply and use this knowledge to survive and to mate.&lt;ref&gt;Plants, also, react to changes in their environment. For example, stomata close in dry weather, rootlets grow toward nourishment, flowers typically open in sunlight, etc. Although no one would claim that plants are thinking when they respond to changes in the environment, this kind of behaviour is genetically encoded, and was probably passed on to animals when they later evolved. Thus, plant reaction to environmental variations may be regarded as being a precursor to animal responsiveness and even to human thinking.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, humans are not the only life forms that think—animals do too.

However, thinking did not become what we generally understand it to be today until early humans discovered the use of words and languages. The next section shows how this ability led to a more comprehensive level of thought, one that we will be calling third-level thinking. Third-level thinking is, primarily, a human activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The advances brought about by human thought have made modern life so different from the way it was just a few hundred years ago, that folks of those days might rightly have called us sorcerers or magicians, were we and a few of our many technologies to suddenly have appeared among them. 

People of such times would have had the upmost difficulty to understand how we can talk to someone many kilometres away, can be heard or how their image can be projected upon a screen, nor how heavy machines can fly through the air, how joints and body organs can be replaced, or how pest- and disease-resistant plants can be developed. Today most of us take these developments for granted.

How has it been possible for humans to discover and accomplish so much in just a few thousand years? Only 5000 years have elapsed since the first major road some 2,857 km from the Persian Gulf to the Aegean Sea, was built, although humans seem to have emerged some 3 million years before that.

Many other species have existed for tens of millions of years; why have none ever attained anything even remotely approaching human achievements? Why did their cognitive ability not develop as it has for humans? The answer, we know, is twofold: We are a relatively puny species, and had to find ways to survive in competition with better adapted animals. 

Fortunately the forest dwelling ancestors of humans developed opposable thumbs for locomotion in trees, and that grasping,  manipulative capacity led to Homo Hablis. When the forest receded (or humans migrated to the savannah grasslands) standing on the back legs provided a wider field of view for avoiding predators and finding prey. Eventually perpetual bipedalism released the upper limbs from locomotion, allowing unrestricted hand usage and maximizing latent abilities to build and use tools. Learning how to make and use tools and weapons involves much more imagination than merely copying, and our ancestors therefore developed advanced, formal signalling which led to language.

Formal audible signalling is widely used to express emotions. Many animals and birds can be heard declaring their feelings when they grunt, cry, bark or sing to signal danger, mark territory or attract mates. Such sounds sum their current emotional state and declare it to the world, conveying meaning to other sentient species around them. Human mothers recognize infant cries and know 'instinctively' when their infants are hungry, uncomfortable, distressed or merely bored. 

Intentional sounds such as an infant cry are not just involuntary reactions to a stimuli — are dramatically improve the probability of survival for the originator and its species.

There is an important difference between publicizing one emotion and vocalizing a series of them. A cry of pain can be an instinctive reaction, requiring no thinking ability—a behaviour discussed previously. A cry of pain followed by one of anger, then one of threat, may well be demonstrating the use of something like a language because the animal is attempting to make others understand and respond to its mental or emotional state.

The development of any language, like most evolutionary change, would doubtlessly have taken place sporadically, in dribbles and spurts. Significant advances were likely only made whenever a particular kind of vocalization could be repeatedly used to convey some special meaning to another, or when an exchange of sounds enabled an exchange of intentions, and such an interchange was reiterated with some consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Much more than this may have been needed. For instance, recent research suggests that the gene FOXP2 mutated some 100,000 years ago, giving humans a genetic sequence that differs from apes in this area. In humans, a deficiency in this gene severely affects how language is both expressed and understood. See Wolfgang Enard et al., “Molecular evolution of FOXP2, a gene involved in speech and language,” ''Nature'', 418, 869-872.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals can, and do, use advanced signalling systems with some proficiency. Gerbils have developed a fairly complex language to warn one another of the presence of predators. Dolphins, like whales, exchange complex information sonically; they can also recognize, and respond appropriately to, the meaning hidden within the grammatical structure of human hand signals. Chimpanzees use primitive language forms, and many have been trained to select symbols that convey their desires for food, drink, or toys. They are also able to express a whole range of other reactions in response to questioning. Several have been trained to use ASL signs, and one such chimp subsequently taught others some signs. The experiments are regarded widely as failures - ''the chimps did not learn language'', they were simply able to mimic an extremely limited number of signs in more-or-less appropriate contexts.&lt;ref&gt;For example, a 14-year old bonobo chimpanzee called Panbanisha, first refused, then “granted” and participated in, an interview with a reporter.  Panbanisha lives at Georgia State University, and has been taught the meaning of about 3,000 words by scientists at the university’s Language Research Centre. Another chimp, Washoe, living at Central Washington University, has a working vocabulary of 240 signs and has taught other chimpanzees to sign.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive language usage would have emerged a great many times as species developed,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Dunbar, in ''Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language'', postulated that ape and monkey groups are necessarily limited in size to less than about 150 animals because they socialize through grooming. He extended this theory to state that languages developed to permit larger groups to bond via social gossip. I favour a different explanation. Group bonding requires intelligence to observe, analyze (i.e., associate relevant memories) or recognize behaviours that promote bonding rather than distancing. In other words, social intelligence incorporates the results of a great number of problem-solving activities. Thus problem solving predates bonding. In my opinion, languages developed to facilitate problem solving.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has never developed to any significant extent (as far as we know) in any species other than our own. Two evolutionary developments contributed to our ability: a deep-set larynx (which forms a large, resonating chamber, possibly helped into position as we began walking upright) and vocal chords (which can vibrate and are controllable). These features allow us to form and vocalize an almost unlimited number of distinctly different sounds.&lt;ref&gt;We are not the only hominids to possess the low-lying larynxes required to form a full range of sounds: 200,000 year old Neandertal bones show that they also possessed such an anatomical feature.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thinking by using word equivalents became possible as soon as words began to be used. A simple proto-language (employing nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, and simple sentence structures) would have begun to take shape from the outset.

Language use improved our species’ ability to recall memories (the first step in discovering links or relationships between them and incoming stimuli). Once relationships had been found and named, early humans would have used this knowledge within their clans to enhance their group’s survival. Third-level thinking and language development would now continue forever hand-in-hand, because an improvement in one concomitantly produces an improvement in the other.

Cassirer, discussing these early phases of language development, stated: “Before the intellectual work of conceiving and understanding of phenomena can set in, the work of naming must have preceded it, and have reached a certain point of elaboration. For it is this process which transforms the world of sense impression, which animals also possess, into a mental world, a world of ideas and meanings. All theoretical cognition takes its departure from a world already preformed by language.”&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, ''Language and Myth'', 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Word arrangements, syntax and sentence structures are essential components of all languages.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Zuberbüler, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, may have found monkey-communication syntax. If so, then some monkey tribes may have developed relatively advanced linguistic abilities. (See James Randerson, “Call of the wild?” ''New Scientist'', 30 March, 2002, 10.)
This issue of the ''New Scientist'' also contains an article that describes how robots, programmed only with “goals, agendas and the desire to form relationships” developed languages employing around 8,000 words. See Helen Phillips, “First Words,” pages 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the ability to sequence thoughts must have developed before language could have evolved. Calvin suggests&lt;ref&gt;William H. Calvin, ''The River that Flows Uphill: A Journey from the Big Bang to the Big Brain'' (New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, 1986). This very readable book interlaces a fact-filled description of the evolution of life and the universe with anecdotes about a trip down the Colorado River.&lt;/ref&gt; that this skill first arose as our ancestors learned how to throw rocks and sticks accurately, an ability which requires the careful sequencing of vision, arm, and finger movements to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;This, if valid, nicely illustrates how a skill that evolved due to its survival value in one area can be put to use in quite a different area. Another, perhaps better known, example of this phenomenon (termed “exaptation”) is the transition of feathers, which are thought to have first evolved as light-weight insulating material to keep the body warm.
Animal bodies have been built from, and consist of, numerous adaptations. Their convoluted origins frequently cause them to be more cumbersome and less efficient than those an intelligent being might design from scratch. The retina of most animal species, for instance, receives photons of light only after they have been filtered through several layers of non-active cells. Contrast this with the eyes of molluscs—light falls immediately upon the retina of an octopus, for example, a much more efficient and sensitive arrangement. Generally, body organs are effective, but probably all might be modified and made more efficient—something scientists have deliberated, and are beginning to attempt.&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have happened some two million years ago, when ''Homo erectus'' emerged from trees to live on the African plains, where surveillance and throwing from an upright posture became a common occurrence.

Sequencing (of data) is a necessary part of comparing memories and incoming stimuli; it simplifies the discovery of meaningful relationships between mental data, and, as earlier noted, relationship-discovering is the quintessential feature of second-level thinking.

Various kinds of evidence exist indicating early human life forms used sophisticated language. Rudgley, in ''The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rudgley, ''The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age'' (New York: The Free Press, 1999), 224-233.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to work done by Dietrich and Ursula Mania, on findings that date to between 350,000 and 300,000 years ago from the Bilzingsleben Lower Palaeolithic site near Halle in former East Germany. This site contains evidence of workshop areas, complete with anvil stones (where tools were made) and stone, wood and bone remnants (all showing tool markings). Four artifacts with a series of parallel-cut incisions were also found. It is thought that a clan of considerable dexterity lived and worked in this area, one which very likely used some rudimentary form of language, and that the parallel lines probably conveyed some specific meaning.

Rhulen, a linguist, investigated word origins, and has found evidence that supports the theory that all languages originate from one, proto-sapiens, language, which existed some 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Merritt Ruhlen, ''The Origin of Language: Tracing the Evolution of the Mother Tongue'' (New York: John Wiley, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols has examined syntax and other structural mechanisms used in languages, and dates their origins even further back, to at least 132,000 y.a.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, ''Linguistic Diversity in Space and Time'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Words and language are central to what we are calling third-level thinking. We may not always select and use actual words when thinking consciously, but a few moment’s reflection about how attention is being directed from one aspect to another within our mind when thinking consciously makes it apparent that we use sentence-structure equivalents. (Tattersall and Matternes go as far as to say that we could not even conceive the idea of thought if we did not use a language.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tattersall and Jay H. Matternes, “Once We Were Not Alone,” ''Scientific American'', January 2000, 62.
For a slightly more recent discussion of the significance of language, read Ian Tattersall, “How We Came to be Human,” ''Scientific American'', December 2001, 56-63.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Third-level thinking manifests itself as if we were talking to ourselves. For instance, when we are preparing to express a point of view we fabricate sentences, developing and rejecting trains of thought within our minds. We usually attempt to follow one main track when thinking, but our central theme is always surrounded by a plethora of other, loosely associated, thoughts and images, each offering more data for potential inclusion. Our thoughts wend their way among these submissions, and only finally crystallize when we mouth or write a statement, or act upon a thought. Cassirer again: “only symbolic expression can yield the possibility of prospect and retrospect, because it is only by symbols that distinctions are not merely made, but fixed in consciousness. What the mind has once created, what has been culled from the total sphere of consciousness, does not fade away again when the spoken word has set its seal upon it and given it definite form.”&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, ''Language and Myth'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-level thinking is slow compared to the speed of second-level thinking because word selection and arrangement takes time. Moreover, third-level thinking is always preceded by second-level thinking. Although we may feel that our conscious thoughts occur immediately, experiments (particularly those with people who have sustained brain damage&lt;ref&gt;For instance, when the connection between the inferior temporal cortex (which handles the signals that allow us to recognize faces) and the limbic system (which deals with emotions) is severed, familiar faces (relatives, for instance) can be recognized, but this recollection is devoid of all emotional associations, making it impossible for affected persons to decide how to appropriately greet an approaching visitor.&lt;/ref&gt;) show that unconscious emotional signals—a component of subconscious thinking, alluded to earlier—always precede conscious thinking, and certainly affect decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging provides evidence suggesting that emotions play a part in every decision made, even decisions that might be considered to be entirely based upon reason. (These emotions may be arising from the role our personal or private goals play in all decision making—see [[../../Making Decisions/Practical Decisions|Practical Decisions]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequences of prior subconscious second-level thinking have been often noted by novelists. They, not infrequently, state that their characters “took over” and wrote the story. Actually, their subconscious second-level thinking would have continuously explored and developed associations between memories of characters, and the results of this activity would have been fed to their conscious second and third level of thinking, giving rise to the feeling that their characters were in control.&lt;ref&gt;The reason why this kind of subconscious activity takes place is explored more fully in [[../../Revelations And Conversions/The Source Of Revelations|The Source Of Revelations]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Language development facilitated huge improvements in ''Homo sapiens’'' ability to problem solve,&lt;ref&gt;E. MacPhail, “Vertebrate Intelligence: The Null Hypothesis,” in the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', 1985, B308:37-51, declares that language is the “big step” to becoming intelligent. I disagree, for “intelligence,” to me, includes that which animals demonstrate when challenged by a problem of concern to them. (For example, tool-invention by animals or barrier-circumvention by squirrels demonstrates intelligence.) Intelligence (see section seven of this chapter) and second-level thinking are one and the same thing; neither requires language. However, language greatly improves the ability to associate findings and ideas; thus language use increases the ability to solve problems, and so acts to increase intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt; and this significantly increased their survival ability. Language use allowed early men and women to teach weapon construction, organize group hunting, deploy themselves to previously determined purposes, and so on, considerably enhancing their chances of obtaining food, killing animals or besting enemies. Greater skill and efficiency in these areas left more time for other activities—in animal and plant domestication, artistry and creativity, pottery and ornament production, culture and recreation, to provide just a few examples. Thinking, language use, problem solving, and the practical application of what has been learned form a spiral of constant and accelerating improvement that continues in humans today. (But only as long as the whole is reality-based: introducing fanciful assumptions about the nature of things warps and obstructs the whole process. More about this in later chapters.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This might be a good time to note that, although we use words as though they mean to others exactly what they mean to us, this is never the case. The precise meaning or nuance of every word differs from one person to another for several reasons.

Minor misunderstanding is vital to language development, for we learn a language by linking mental images of objects and events to words and phrases that we memorize. But the library of mental images we each must have before we can begin to learn a language is built from life experiences, and these are unique to each possessor. Every word a speaker or writer uses is defined for that person by the bank of memories carried within their mind. 

Each person hearing or reading these words interprets their meaning using their own memory set. (A couple of crude examples: one person says “tree,” thinking of a small fir tree in a garden; the other person hears “tree,” and thinks of a large maple tree in a forest. Or, one person says “look at that motor,” admiring a vehicle's colour; the other says “yes,” seeing the same vehicle, but thinking of the engine that powers it.)

We can never convey precisely what we have in mind to another person, but as long as we are '''sane''' we can get close. Legally, a person whose internal  mental model is not reliably realistic of the external real world is said to be '''insane'''. Furthermore, each of us defines what we consider to be true by referring to what we know about ourselves and our universe (i.e., by referring to the memories of reality that life has delivered to our minds since infancy) and this is constantly changing, as our knowledge about objects and events keeps changing.&lt;ref&gt;Reality differs from person to person, and greatly depends upon the accuracy of each person’s sensory perceptions. This is unquestionably demonstrated by people suffering from synesthesia (who often see black letters, words, and numerals as coloured differently, or as coloured symbols, or who may experience loud noises as bright lights, and so on). See Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and Edward M. Hubbard, “Hearing Colors, Tasting Shapes,” ''Scientific American'', May 2003, 52-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even our personal definition of the “truth” will change as we ourselves age and mature.&lt;ref&gt;The concept of “truth” is convoluted and personalized precisely because each of us uses our own experiences to interpret what different words mean. And as Ullian (W. V. Quine and J. S. Ullian, ''The Web of Belief'' [Random House, 1970]) argued, everything we think we know about the universe is subject to revision. Mathematics comes closest to being the “truth” (as we shall see in [[../../Solving Problems/Mathematical Problems|Mathematical Problems]]), and religion frequently claims to be absolute, but both give way in light of new knowledge (mathematics more readily than religion). Try as we may, our mental deliberations and verbal expositions can never represent the whole, real, or perfect truth because we can never know it, and because we can never find words precise enough to think or express it. Furthermore, different people will always interpret their personal experiences of the same event in different ways. The “pure and simple truth” can never be expressed.
Quine pointed out that no statement is necessarily true except those we ourselves decide to be true. In fact, extending the discussions presented in earlier sections of this chapter, since the words we use must necessarily be selected from our own mental dictionary of meanings, each one of us defines our own truth. This truth can never be conveyed to another. The best anyone else can do is to try to assimilate the general idea, then, using their own frame of reference, guess at what is meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is interesting to note that a “Theory Of Everything” (see [[../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]]), if ever formulated, is expected to be only expressible mathematically. It would be impossible to sufficiently define words to represent all that this theory would be capable of telling us. A Theory of Everything would devolve to other less-comprehensive theories (e.g., quantum mechanics or a theory of gravity), which could be more or less understood through defining words, but the Theory of Everything itself could not be linguistically defined.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that word meanings change over time and become more precise as we understand more, can be readily illustrated by considering the word “atom.” Two thousand years ago there was debate about whether such a thing even existed. 

Two hundred years ago a few believed that atoms existed, but no one knew anything about their structure. Twenty five years ago physicists wondered about the possibility of quarks existing within atoms; today we know that quark trios make up the protons and neutrons that are nuclear components of every atom, and that quarks are possibly composed of dimensionally bound energy fields.

Now, not everyone knows such details, but some do, and given enough study, most of us could learn more. So the images that the word “atom” conjures up in the minds rather depends on our level of understanding, and for those with more learning each word or expressed concept is clearly more meaningful, precise, potentially useful and valuable than the mind images of those who do not know very much about such things.

Remove language, and third-level thinking will disappear, mental consciousness&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of consciousness see the postscript to this chapter, [[../../Consciousness And Conscience/]].&lt;/ref&gt; will degenerate, and what we have been calling second-level thinking will be all that remains. Uninhibited feelings and emotions may then dominate behaviour as they once must have done in dinosaur days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linking sensory data together, as second-level thinking does, can produce meaningful results precisely because everything in the universe is linked to every other thing through causality. Causality simply means that nothing in the universe happens without some preceding cause. This more-or-less obvious fact (known to René Descartes over three hundred years ago) actually reveals several other important details about the universe.

Causality states that everything that happens has been caused by some previous event or events, and it means that everything that exists today was created from some thing or things that existed in another form at an earlier time. In other words, events and things don’t just appear out of thin air, something causes them to appear.

It is easy to understand that everything is made from smaller pieces, and that these are, in turn, made from even smaller fragments. Also we can readily understand that the properties of any structure depends upon the properties of its components. For example, we don’t build railway bridges out of wood these days; it’s not strong enough. We use steel made mostly from iron, because iron atoms are tightly bound together by an electromagnetic force. (Wood is made from larger, widely spaced, carbon-based molecules that are only weakly held together.) The properties and behaviour of everything can be similarly explained in terms of more fundamental properties, once we know enough. The point is, we wouldn’t discover any such relationship through second-level thinking, nor develop any such explanation with all its useful predictions, if the universe was not causal.

Causality affects everything about us; it allows us to learn and it allows us to make things that work. Consequently (although not consciously) we have built this concept deep into the roots of the languages we use and the thinking we do.&lt;ref&gt;This is why we expect our religions and their teachings to be rational and are disappointed when they appear to be irrational. (More about this in later chapters.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, we don’t usually go around saying that the universe is causal; we just expect it to behave rationally or logically. Rational behaviour has been defined as behaviour that is consistent with, or based upon, reason or logic, and neither is possible without the existence of limitless causal relationships. One single break in this chain of causality would negate every one of the explanations and predictions we so much rely upon in all aspects of life.

The fact that the universe is causal has a number of very interesting linguistic consequences. One is that the very words and languages we use must grow out of, and conform to, the reality that surrounds us. This cannot be otherwise. We might try to invent a language not limited by the nature of the universe, but what could it possibly be? Existing words could not be used, for each one carries some of our understanding about the nature of things. Words would have to be invented, but none of these could refer to anything within the universe, by definition of what we are trying to do. We would end up with gibberish, not a language. It would convey no meaning and bring about no understanding. In fact we could not even invent such a language, because we are unable to think without being affected and constrained by the logic and rationality of the knowledge about the universe that we carry within our brains.

Steven Pinker&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language'' (New York: William Morrow and Company, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; argues in support of Chomsky's theory that a “Universal Grammar” underlies and constrains all languages. He further claims that the existence of a Universal Grammar is evidence that culture is not just a matter of nature and nurture, as the standard social science model would have us believe. This, he suggests, means that morality cannot be relative to time or situation, but must be universal and becomes built into our minds by our use of a language.

As for morality; we devise our moral statements using words whose definitions vary from one language to another, and that change from time to time and from person to person, as previously noted. Some might conclude from this that no humanly stated moral law or ethical principle can be universal or permanent. By the same token, it has been known since Herodotus (to name just one historical writer) that varied opinions as to right and wrong have existed simultaneously as far back as can be traced. It is difficult to conclude from mere variety of expression that there is no underlying human basis nor that such a basis is impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary'', John P. Bethal, General Editor (Springfield, Mass.: G. &amp; C. Merriman Co., 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; defines intelligence as follows.

''The power or act of understanding; mental acuteness or sagacity; the power of meeting any situation, esp. a novel situation, successfully by proper behavior adjustments; the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal.''

Any of these definitions may be applied to second-level thinking. Third-level thinking enhances and continues this process; it amplifies “mental acuteness or sagacity.” Thus, thinking and intelligence amount to much the same thing. Chapter Two investigates this connection a little more fully by discussing the mental gymnastics of problem solving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following points are important to this discussion.

* The brain receives, stores (in temporary as well as permanent locations), and uses information to direct activities that support the body’s welfare. These responses are mostly “hardwired,” the result of millions of years of evolution, and do not involve what we call “thinking.”
* The mind develops as meaningful relationships between stored information (memories) and incoming sensory perceptions are discovered. Mental activities include becoming aware (first-level thinking), noting relationships (second-level thinking), and consciously manipulating information using words and a language.
* Sentient species think (to the extent that this is possible for their species) and act rationally most of the time. To do otherwise reduces the species’ chances of survival because their home (the universe) is rationally (i.e., causally) constructed. 

A dropped larynx, vocal chords, time, imagination, and much practice, have changed grunts into sonnets, and caves into space stations. Languages have allowed us to name, record and even tell friends on the other side of the world about the neural-link-forming relationships we discover everywhere we bother to look.

The universe’s causality binds thinking, language and intelligence together. Applying what we have discovered through investigating causality’s consequences enables us to solve problems and make decisions proficiently. Rational thought helps us to survive; it gifts us with understanding and confers a degree of control over objects and events.

Additional layers of mental ability will doubtless accrue as life continues to evolve: heightened empathy, intuitive-like jumps in comprehension, telepathy perhaps; capabilities unimaginable today, as some of our current capabilities would have been unimaginable a few thousand years ago. Life’s rise from bacteria to cephalopod to humankind—as we can trace on this planet alone—provides reason enough to expect more intellectual aptitude to come in the future.

The future of humans as a species is much less predictable. It depends so much on our willingness to think and act rationally. Solving problems and making decisions, both practical and moral, in a manner that respects the universe’s causality, are the activities that will determine humanity’s future.

It is time to examine how we actually perform these tasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans excel at solving problems. (Pinker actually states that the mind has evolved simply to outsmart the competition by being able to solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''How the Mind Works'' (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1997), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans living and working in space is possibly one of the best examples of how successful we have become in problem solving, but examples can be found in all fields of endeavour, from discovering how genes work, to creating an emotional demand for a new product.

Problems come in two flavours, tangible and abstract. Or, if you like, practical and metaphysical. The difference between these two types can be illustrated by discussing the kinds of problems that interest mathematicians and scientists. Chapter Two provides some examples, then explores how we all typically go about solving everyday problems. This approach will show why moral problems are often difficult to solve, what humans have done to reduce this difficulty, and prepares the way for later suggesting what might be done to facilitate moral problem solving in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mathematics is a set of precise languages comprising such topics as arithmetic (numbers) geometry (shapes) Algebra (symbols) and calculus (concepts).

Mathematics is an edifice, built from the ground up, assembled, definition by definition, from scratch. Those of you who studied geometry in school will remember its never-ending series of theorem proofs. Geometry, we were told, is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, taught by Pythagoras in the sixth century BCE, and used by the Pharaohs’ surveyors to restore field boundaries each time the Nile flooded. Geometry starts with the very simplest statement, a definition of a point, a line or a circle, then looks for the extensions and connections that are logically implicit within these definitions. The whole process is repeated each time a new definition (that of a parallelogram, for instance) is introduced. 

Mathematicians have been adding new definitions to geometry for centuries. At the same time, they have been busy constructing other branches of mathematics: algebra, calculus, trigonometry, topology, set theory, and so on. Each function, each definition, and each statement in every branch has to be very carefully assessed for logical consistency when introduced, then again every time it is used to link to something newly added, and once more whenever it is put to theoretical or practical use. This is done, because each newly added feature introduces more relationships, and it is these relationships that determine if the whole assembly makes sense. Mathematics, then, is held together just as precisely as the universe itself seems to be held together.&lt;ref&gt;And perhaps by the same formula—something like: the universe’s underlying causality enforces its rational behaviour, while mathematics underlying rationality enforces its causal interrelationships.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through these means, mathematics is created to be internally sound and rational, self sufficient to the extent of possessing its own reality, dependent upon the real world only in as much as it is built from a language defined in the real world, and connected to the real world in meaning only if we choose to make such a connection. By itself, mathematics is abstract, pure and complete; it does not need to be given any link to the universe (other than that necessarily implicit in its nomenclature). In fact, it is not uncommon for mathematicians to explore the properties of creations such as multidimensional space or imaginary numbers—fancies which no one has experienced first hand.

However, we can, and very often do, link our mathematical understandings to the real world. We do this, for instance, when demonstrating to children that three fingers plus two fingers equals five fingers. Remarkably, it is becoming more and more certain that the mentally constructed world of abstract mathematics contains the ability to describe, explain and predict the very concrete behaviour of the real universe we inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, mathematics must describe the real world because each of its many terms has been precisely defined using language, a language that has itself been constructed from our knowledge of the real world (as [[../../Thinking/Thinking And The Universe|Thinking And The Universe]] and the previous paragraph pointed out).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pythagoras showed this over two and a half thousand years ago, when he described mathematically a property of two dimensional space (the relationship between squares formed on the sides of a right-angled triangle). Newton demonstrated the same connection between mathematics and reality over four hundred years ago, when he showed mathematically that the force holding planets in orbit is related to the involved masses and distances between them. 

Einstein confirmed this connection when he discovered and proved, again mathematically, that the properties of the four (space-plus-time) dimensions prohibit matter from moving faster than the speed of light. Mathematicians continually push the boundaries and today routinely use complex number theories to define the properties of multidimensional space, a reality which some think may actually exist (perhaps within black holes, or defining fundamental &quot;superstring&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]].&lt;/ref&gt; properties, or building a universe external to our own).

Because mathematics has been rigorously and logically constructed to be an abstract entity, mathematicians think that its various domains will be considered to be as true in a million years time as they would have been a million years ago, long before they could have been understood by any sentient being living upon this planet. (Moreover, because scientists can use mathematics to predict and explain events occurring billions of light-years distant.&lt;ref&gt;A light-year is the distance that light travels through space in one year, about 9.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; kilometres, or 5.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; miles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians also consider that these mathematical statements hold true in other galaxies, and are therefore discoverable by life forms living upon planets in those regions.) To pure mathematicians, it is often a subsequent (and, possibly, less important) finding that the mathematical properties they uncover have meaning in the real world. They prefer to solve problems within the bounded beauty of a fully discoverable, self-consistent, abstract world. Be this as it may, the many connections between abstract mathematics and the practical realities of the real world have allowed us to solve countless complex problems, and have led to a multitude of discoveries in arenas as diverse as economics, sociology, epidemiology, space flight, nuclear physics, genetics, cosmology and medicine, to name just a few.

That logically generated mathematics describes and defines the universe so accurately reinforces a fact that has already been stated: the universe must be causal and rational, for, if it were not, the intrinsic fit between mathematics and the universe’s functioning would not exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Science is the observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of observed phenomena that can be tested and challenged by others.

Scientists are a similar breed of specialists to mathematicians. They also deduce relationships, but their work typically starts from, and is grounded in, the concrete world (for example, in the field or in the laboratory), rather than the abstract world.&lt;ref&gt;There are many important branches of theoretical science, where specialists work with pen and paper (or, more often these days, with computers) and do not work in laboratories or the field, but their work will always have its links to the real world. If it didn’t, colleagues would probably start calling them mathematicians.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists aim to uncover the causal and connective relationships that exist between “real” events and “real” things. They strive to explain and understand reality.

We might say that science began when humans started to wonder about the nature of their surroundings in some kind of organized manner; when individuals first asked what might be causing the sun and stars to appear to move, or thunder to deafen, or animals to be so similar inside yet so outwardly different. 

Middleton, in his 1963 discourse on the scientific revolution, realized that this occurred many centuries ago. He noted that Thales of Miletus (who lived from 640-546 BC) wanted to ''explain'' the universe. In other words, Thales understood that there is a causal reason for each tiny piece of the universe to be the way it is. This, stated Middleton, marked the birth of science.&lt;ref&gt;W. E. K. Middleton, ''The Scientific Revolution'' (Toronto: C.B.C. Publications, 1963), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slowly, by careful observation, control of variables, measurement, accurate records, repetition and a great deal of thought, scientists began to understand why nature behaves as it does. Understanding grew in leaps and bounds once scientists learned to extend their senses’ abilities by building instruments: first measuring sticks, balances and graduated containers, then micrometers, microscopes and telescopes. 

People eventually discovered (only about two centuries ago) that precision and knowledge go hand-in-hand with the ability to challenge accepted wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;This is because the universe’s various substructures (e.g., quarks, electrons, atoms, etc.) are very small.&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate measurements allowed Copernicus and Galileo to place the sun, rather than the Earth, at the centre of our collection of planets.&lt;ref&gt;They both probably knew that Aristarchus of Samos had discussed the idea of a sun-centred solar system in the third century BCE. (And was promptly accused of impiety for doing so.)&lt;/ref&gt; Newton carefully observed moving objects (some say a falling apple), then wrote the gravitational formula that explains how the universe is held together. Wallace and Darwin recorded fine details of life’s species, then deduced the mechanism of evolution. Einstein employed acutely crafted thought-experiments about relativity, then extended the significance and value of Newton’s work.

Scientists and mathematicians follow similar methodologies; they seek and uncover facts, then try to discover any relationships that may exist between these facts, or between these and other known facts or theories. Both professions are delving deeper and deeper into the nature of the universe, and the two, seemingly distinct, knowledge domains are converging. Scientists routinely use mathematics to obtain precision and to extend their discipline’s utility. Mathematicians use their skills to describe what is happening in the centre of stars, and to reconstruct what must have happened moments after the universe began. The abstract explains the concrete; the concrete adds flesh to the abstract.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Of course we all, scientists, mathematicians, or laypersons, solve many problems every day. While most of these are addressed and resolved routinely and efficiently, the speed and accuracy of our problem solving depends almost entirely upon one factor—how well we understand the background situation, i.e., the “environment” (examples discussed below will shortly clarify and extend this term) that contains and presents the problem we are trying to solve. Everyday problems are solved very quickly, often without realizing a problem is being addressed, because we generally know a lot about the various environments we inhabit. On the other hand, scientific and mathematical problems not infrequently take a long time to solve; this is usually because those working on the problem do not yet have sufficient information about their problem’s environment.

To correctly solve any problem then, we must correctly understand its “environment.” This is because a problem is only properly solved when its solution can be used within (or is accepted by) the relevant environment, without causing additional problems. Luckily, each problem’s environment also invariably contains the criteria which the problem’s solution must satisfy.

It is important to understand the meaning of the term “environment” when used in the current context. The word is used here to identify the physical, social, occupational, political, economic, religious, cultural, or other context (or an often complex combination of several such contexts) that contain the problem that confronts us. Recognizing that problems exist within one or more environments is key to understanding how problems (particularly moral ones) are solved.

Thinking about a few everyday situations may help to clarify this discussion. Consider dressing, cutting the lawn, and cooking a meal. The choices to be made in each case can be thought of as being minor problems to be solved, and we’ll review each in turn.

When we select something to wear from a choice of clothes, we refer to the occasion or situation for which we are dressing in order to decide what to wear. This is so whether we are dressing for work, to go on a trip, climb a mountain, or just lounge in the house. We choose clothes by considering what’s available (e.g., clean, comfortable, appropriate, etc.) and the circumstances pertaining when wearing the clothes (e.g., temperature, weather, others present, etc.), although for routine occasions this may happen so quickly that we don’t notice that we are solving little problems. The criteria or standards that determine the success of the eventual choice made is clearly located in the environment that presents the problem—in some of the situations just mentioned, the work, social, local, or home environments. (Furthermore, note that the environment also determines what kind of goal can be achieved successfully; for instance, it is not possible to receive praise for being fashionably dressed if no one else will be present when lounging in the house. More about this in [[../../Making Decisions/Practical Decisions|Practical Decisions]].)

Consider the second example. I look out of the window and notice that the grass needs cutting, perhaps just a small problem now but one that will grow if neglected. So I make the decision to mow the grass later in the afternoon. In this case, note that I appear to be driven to meet some standard of lawn appearance, and that this standard has been set by my external environment—the society and culture in which I live. If I had earlier decided to ignore society’s conventions, or if I lived in a place where people did not bother about such matters, then long grass would not be seen as a problem, and I may not even notice how tall the grass had become. Note, again, that when there is a problem, it is an external environment that both thrusts the problem upon me, and that holds the standards or criteria to be met when correcting the problem. Living in town, I would probably have to mow the grass weekly; living in the country, once or twice a month might suffice.

Now the third example: imagine preparing a meal. When I am in this situation I find that before I can choose a menu or select a method of cooking I must first think about who will be eating the meal, what food is available, where I might have to go to buy missing ingredients, what might be nice to eat today, what has been recently eaten by those attending, other goals I might want to achieve with these particular guests, and so on. All of these thoughts relate to my environment (the physical, social, nutritional and emotional elements mostly, in this case) and this environment limits what I can do if I want to cook and serve a successful meal.

Note that, besides referring to external environments we also refer to what’s inside our minds, our “internal environment,” because a great deal of relevant information has been stored there and some of it is used in making any decision. For example, our mind tells us what cooking skills we have, whether or not the lawn mower is in working condition, when a particular suit was last worn, etc. But, in all cases, our mind is only providing previously acquired information relevant to the situation we are in, and this information always comes from some knowledge of external environments of one kind or another.

Sometimes, our own bodies may present a problem to the mind (a craving for salty food, for instance), in which case it is our body’s feelings or standards of well-being that have to be included in the problem-solving process. This is still an example of a problem stemming from an environment external to the mind (the organs or systems that are calling for salt are external to the mind. Problems that arise solely within the mind are special situations, and will be discussed in section four.)

We should mention here that dressing or cooking to suit nothing other than our own current feelings is also, like the salt-craving example, an attempt to satisfy a mood biochemically caused by some agent (dopamine or serotonin, perhaps) within our body or brain, i.e., it emanates from a source that is again external to our mind. We choose the solution that best satisfies our desires. In cases like these, we might say we “go with the flow.” (A few of us may try to do this much of the time—living in the “here and now” was popular a few decades ago and is still a desired behaviour for some.) However, simply responding to biochemical desires is an emotional, not reasoned, response to a situation, and not of much pertinence to the current discussion.

To recapitulate and summarize this section: problems can never be solved without reference to the particular environment that presents them. This will always be true, for several reasons. First, we have to know, understand and explore the properties of a problem’s environment to determine what is causing a problem. Second, each environment contains the criteria that must be met if a problem is to be solved without causing additional problems. And, third, we must know what the environment will permit us to achieve before we can select an achievement to strive for. Only once we understand what is causing the problem, what can or can’t be done about it, what end-results are achievable (and desirable to us—more about this in [[../../Making Decisions/Practical Decisions|Practical Decisions]]), can we then solve the problem. In short; to succeed, we must know what we want and can do.

Well, that is probably enough about how we solve practical problems; now we are ready to investigate what we do to solve moral problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Morality means thinking and acting in accord with standards of right or good conduct according to the system of ideas of right and wrong held by society. Religious morality emerged as a survival strategy, so in most religions it is generally forbidden to kill other people, but there are occasions when killing is permitted. Most formal religious organizations resist the abolition of the death penalty (capital punishment) for criminals, and support ''just wars'', yet many ordinary people interpret religious scripts against killing more literally, as does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its little sister, the European Convention.

Much less difficult moral problems can emerge from any environment—home, family, business, social, medical, and so on, and many may look just like any other kind of problem. None come with a flag that states, “Beware—Moral Problem!” So, the mind cranks up the same problem-solving routine it has been using since second-level thinking began. It gathers details about the situation that presents the problem and quickly formulates several solutions. It then has to decide which solution is the most appropriate. And this is where difficulties may arise, as a simple example might illustrate.

Imagine that someone in a store takes an item to the checkout counter and the clerk rings up the wrong price. If the checkout price is higher than it should be, most people would question it and ask for a correction. But, if it were lower, some might speak up while others might say nothing. This kind of situation, most would say, is a moral one, and the action taken would be the result of making a moral decision. The problem of which choice to make (speak up and pay more, or say nothing and save) can be simple for some. Many might invariably be “honest” and speak up; others might always choose to maximize their personal gain and would say nothing. People in either of these categories might not even notice that there is a choice; for them there is no problem to be solved, their mind-set automatically provides just one solution and they act upon the decision their mind presents without questioning it.

However, some would see that they are being asked to make a moral decision, and this is where difficulties can arise. To understand why, we have to discuss what’s happening in a little more detail.

Moral problems are actually very similar to mathematical problems. Like math problems (which have their origins in the abstract mathematical environment that defines them), moral problems arise from their own abstract moral environment. And we must understand the true nature of this environment in order to find satisfactory solutions. Moreover, the more difficult the problem is, the more we have to understand about its environment.

Moral problems ask the mind to decide which solutions are “right” rather than “wrong,” and which behaviours might be deemed to be “good” rather than “bad.” Now, as we have seen, the criteria needed to select the right answers for practical problems are found by examining the environment that presents the problem. But what environment actually presents moral problems? From where do they stem? This would be the rightful place to find the criteria sought, but this presents a dilemma: the universe contains no practical, concrete, “real” or verifiable moral environment waiting to be found and consulted.

Moral problems arise solely within the mind, and it is therefore the mind itself that both defines the moral environment and contains the criteria that solutions must meet to be deemed satisfactory. Everything that makes some particular concern a “moral problem” to a person is contained wholly within that person’s mind. Thus, it is the mind-set of the customer at the checkout counter that determines if being undercharged presents a moral problem, and it is this mind-set that provides the frame of reference that is drawn upon when the decision to speak up or remain silent is made.

We should stop here to consider what this means, and what we typically do about it. If a person is a practicing member of a religion, then they almost certainly possess an appropriate mental environment which they can consult when contemplating moral issues, and usually nothing stops the problem-solving process for them at this point. The most important function of any religion is to build such a mental environment, to teach followers what to believe and how to behave (that is, to provide solutions that resolve various kinds of moral problems). The “religious environment,” the neural networks constituting memories that those following a religion have spent time building within their minds, is available for exactly these occasions. It is rare (although perhaps now becoming more common) to encounter a moral problem that has not been already solved by others within the doctrine, but, if ever this does occur, then the adherent is expected to think about what has been written in religious texts, taught by their religious teachers, or said by a religious leader. The devout likely solve most of the moral problems they encounter by referring to one or more of these sources. More complicated issues might involve talking to a theologian or other respected authority. But there exists, for people following a religion, a relevant environment to consult, in which can be found the criteria to judge which solutions are acceptable, as well as the valued purpose that provides reasons for making the “correct” choice.

However, it may be that many moral problems are not actually solved this way today, even by the devout. Perhaps some, or even most, everyday “moral” problems are in fact solved by recourse to the individual’s social or cultural environment.&lt;ref&gt;When individuals judge people (or more accurately but perhaps less frequently, people’s behaviour) to be “good” or “bad,” they most commonly use criteria valued by their own society. (Note that these values always mirror those espoused by the nation’s dominant religion; this is because religions gain their prominence by both guiding the state’s evolution and by being reciprocally supported by the state as it grows.) Society and its intertwined institutions (families, schools, churches, governing bodies, powers-elite, laws, etc.) collectively, over time, determine what is considered “good” or “bad” within that society. And society’s criteria provide adequate guidance for many, probably the majority, of us, for we often look no further when making a moral decision.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, perhaps when a person wants to know the “right thing to do,” they [possibly quite subconsciously] might think along these lines; “now, what does society sanction?” Or, “what would my group expect of me?” They might even think, “what can I get away with?” Or, “how far can I go without being caught?” The last two examples might be a little extreme, but they serve to make a point: that in many situations today we may actually be obtaining our values, our standards, the criteria we use to judge which solutions are morally acceptable, from the social sub-set we inhabit, not from our religion.&lt;ref&gt;These criteria reflect Kohlberg’s six stages of moral judgement: from Self-Interest (Punishment and Reward) through Social Approval (Interpersonal Relations and Social Order) to Abstract Ideals (Social Contract and Universal Rights). See Lawrence Kohlberg, ''The Meaning and Measurement of Moral Development'' (Massachusetts: Clark University, 1981). Or see Lawrence Kohlberg, ''Essays on Moral Development. Volume I. The Philosophy of Moral Development: Moral Stages and the Idea of Justice'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1981), 409-412.
Kohlberg, and others, have found that children generally operate at the first two stages (Punishment and Reward)—as do many in prison; that most adults work at stage four (Social Order); and very few are at stage five (Social Contract). No one has yet been found at stage six (Universal Rights).&lt;/ref&gt; I suspect that, to the extent that this may be true, it is mostly so because our religions are failing to keep up with the changing times.&lt;ref&gt;Social mores, of course, are necessarily trivial standards in this book’s frame of reference because they are local and temporal. The criteria used to determine correct social behaviour vary from society to society and are constantly changing. (They can even be observed changing from moment to moment during emergencies.)&lt;/ref&gt;

So be it for those who have a religion to follow, or those who can be satisfied by adopting their society’s criteria of what a “good person” should do. People with these ideologies can make decisions (and feel or be certain that they have behaved morally) by consulting their knowledge of these constructed environments. But, what about those who have no mental religious environment to guide their decisions and disdain the vagaries of social standards? How can these people solve moral problems? Admittedly, there may be relatively few such people today, but there must have been many pondering such dilemmas before religions became common features of social life. Since we will shortly be investigating the emergence of religions, it is particularly important to explore what such people might do.

Presumably, some who have thought about such issues will have worked out their own value system, perhaps one based upon standards drawn piecemeal from one or more existing religions or societies they know about, but personalized in some manner. Others might just “play things by ear,” letting their emotions and feelings tell them how to behave as each situation unfolds. But a few, surely, would not be satisfied by such methods, and would want to work out solutions in a careful and rational manner. Where are these individuals to obtain the criteria they need to make moral choices? The physical environment holds none. The social environment has been ruled insignificant. Every religious source has been deemed artificial or irrelevant. And, they lack an appropriate internal, or mental, environment. How can such individuals solve moral issues rationally, and make decisions they can live with?

We are not quite ready to answer such questions yet but will do so in Chapter Three, where we explore how decisions are made. Before then, there are a couple of other issues that should be addressed. The first has to do with what people consider to be moral problems; the second asks why such problems arise.

It is difficult to provide examples of moral problems because what may be a concern for some, may not be so for others. But I will propose a few that may illustrate the point to be noted.

Consider a woman who has learned that the fetus she is carrying has a life-threatening defect. Some may see this situation as a moral issue, others may see it as a practical one. However, the point is, for this discussion, a religious person might have fewer options regarding the fetus than others; for example, abortion may be out of the question for those of certain faiths, and the woman may have no choice at all regarding her situation. Those without such a religion may have a greater number of options, but may lack guidelines of any kind; they would likely find it very difficult to make a decision about the fetus.

Another example: consider someone whose spouse is terminally ill, in considerable pain, and who expresses a wish to die. May the healthy spouse act to fulfil such a desire? How does a non-religious person make this kind of decision, if they see it as a moral issue? How do they justify the choice they make? (And, is this justification likely to be acceptable in law, or to society?)

An example that shows the global nature of moral dilemmas today: what criteria should nations use to determine if intervening in another country’s affairs is justified? Is committing genocide a moral problem? By what criteria is this decided? What “environment” defines the situation as a moral, rather than a practical, one? What “greater purpose” is there to be achieved that permits overriding the tradition of respecting another nation’s autonomy?

One final example: many see acts of terrorism, when innocent bystanders, children and adults, are maimed or killed, as morally reprehensible. But an unknown number of others see such acts as a short-cut to paradise. One act—two diametrically opposite views, with seemingly no middle ground to enable reconciliation.

Clearly, by providing the otherwise non-existent but needed mental environment, religions fulfil a necessary role. Just as clearly, current religions are unable to provide a singular environment that could apply to and be adopted by all nations of the world. Consequently, humanity has no common moral authority to cite, and no collective conscience. The sudden collapse of energy giant Enron Corporation illustrates what can happen to organizations that lack moral environments. We might ask ourselves if such things as terrorism or the wealth disparity between nations (which affects maybe a billion or more people) illustrate that civilization lacks the same thing and if global collapse is a possible consequence.

The second question we should touch upon before moving on is: what prompts the appearance of “moral” problems? If individuals possess no inherent mental “religious” environment and have to be taught in order to construct one, then why would any “moral” problem have arisen in the first place? What would have prompted its appearance?

This question is easy to answer. Moral problems arise simply because the mind has the words and language that makes posing such problems possible. It is our mind’s ability to manipulate words that causes it to ask, “is it right to do this?” Humans are so used to mentally seeking the best course of action to take when practical alternatives arise that it is done automatically whenever more than one choice is offered. To put it crudely, we simply daydream moralistic alternatives, and then become stuck when trying to decide, “what is the right thing to do now?”

Without the mental ability to pose and answer questions (i.e., to note and solve problems) we could not ask ourselves if anything were right or wrong. In short, we don’t agonize over moral problems because we must, we do so simply because our mental ability with languages makes it possible, as the “moral” problems presented earlier in this section demonstrate. Our daily requirement to decide how to behave (together with the fact that religions have made the words “moral” and “ethical” part of most people’s vocabulary) is all that is needed to prompt such inquiries.

We are now well equipped to investigate the nature of decision making. Doing so will provide answers to the questions asked earlier: how can individuals solve moral issues rationally, and make decisions they can live with, if they lack a relevant (possibly religious) mental environment?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The mind uses words, phrases and thinking patterns that have developed as a result of dealing with real world situations. Questions such as, “should I take this path?” are perfectly answerable when walking along wooded trails, for example, because we may have a map that describes the territory, and because, presumably, we know where we want to go or what we want to achieve. The very same words seem to be meaningful when asked metaphysically, but often they are not—the question can arrive without a map or a goal of any kind in mind.

Mathematicians and theoretical scientists, it must be emphasized, do have a map and a purpose in mind when they begin their explorations. They, therefore, can pose abstract questions, and are able to find meaningful answers. Every iota of their maps is connected, each to another, joined by the glue of rationality, and logical exploration of the territories they describe is practical and possible.

Theologians also have maps, but the glue holding the pieces of their maps together is faith, which, unfortunately, may bear no relationship to logic or fact. This may not have mattered in days of yore, when logical consistency was of little importance, but every aspect of modern society is driven by technology and its computers, and humans living in modern environments are beginning to demand that their religions become as rational as they themselves are being forced to become. A modern age is calling for a modern religion, a call that might be very dangerous to ignore.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The previous chapter observed that we solve problems by consulting their relevant environments, and that this is both to understand the problem and to find the criteria that an acceptable solution must satisfy. We glossed over the fact that there are frequently several solutions to each problem that will satisfy these criteria. This chapter discusses how the mind decides which solution to adopt. The answer in brief is: we make decisions in order to achieve a valued purpose.

== Removal of RFD Status ==

I'm removing the RFD Status for this Wikibook, and I'm also changing the name and placing it as a sub-page to the more general Chess Wikibook under Variants.  A more standardized format for discussing chess variants could be developed, but at least this gives this module some more life than simply getting deleted.  See the VfD discussion for more details, and this shouldn't be renominiated except to kill the whole Chess Wikibook (very unlikely at all).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:51, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

== name ==

Why is this called &quot;Random Opening&quot; Chess? The starting position (which I assume is what &quot;opening&quot; refers to here) is not random in any way. It's chosen by the players, and they get to think and use strategy while they choose it. It's in no way &quot;random&quot;.

== Fischer Random Chess ==
Fischer came up with the idea not so that humans can be computers, but because at the master level of play more and more moves are being memorized and whoever is winning in the beginning is contested by memory of openings, and at the master level slight advantages go a long way</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Serial Data Communication==

I see that you are somewhat new to this wiki, and possibly Wiki writing in general.  I would recommend that you add comments onto the discussion page of the article instead of embeding them within the text of the article itself.  The purpose of this is to try and keep the text itself clean in terms of editing.

I know that you had some criticisms about the content of the Prerequisite section of the Programming:Serial Data Communications Wikibook.  Some of this is semantics that you are picking at, but I can acknowledge that there is a need to reword what I am saying there.  Thank you for that criticism, and I'll try to rework it to something that makes the intent come across in a more positive manner, as well as be more clear where and how it seems from by background where most computer programmers seem to pick up this knowledge.  I was trying to suggest that learning about serial data communications, or most remote access environment protocols, does not come from a university class that they took trying to get a degree but rather something they had to pick up &quot;on the job&quot; when they were given an assignment by a supervisor to take care of some issue.  That learning usually came from a book, and a poorly written book at that.  I know this Wikibook isn't that great to behold either, but at least it is a start, and it has the potential to become something much better.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:47, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

== Printable wikibooks ==

(Sorry it took so long to reply) Yes, I'll try and write a script that converts wikibooks to PDF, possibly by changing the mediawiki code itself. I'm not planning to do this in the immediate future though -- I don't have enough time for this now. It's a larger project than it sounds...

[[User:Sideris|Sideris]] 20:54, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

== wikijunior ==

If you can point me at the articles you are working on, I'll give some more specific advice.  I think material should be understandable by anyone in the age group, so it might be that simpler expressions are more appropriate, but I think the content itself can be aimed pretty high.  If you want some info on who wants these books, maybe [[User:Zanimum]] on wikipedia might have some info.  I do have a lot going on, but if there's some specific help you need I'll do my best.  [[User:Pedant|Pedant]] 05:50, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
: Zanimum also comes around here from time to time.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 02:31, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

==Images==
Yes I did use to use MS Word but I did eventually get a proper drawing program (Serif Draw Plus) and I used that to create the Sun diagram. However there is nothing to stop you from taking the PNG and putting it as a background and so putting new text over the top.  Or you could use a bitmap image editor like the Gimp and directly alter it that way. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:33, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

Hi. Please see my note on the Solar System Talk Page. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 03:28, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

I was glad to help, if only a little. I am in the process of moving right now, from New York to Florida, closing up one job and starting on another, so my time is rather limited. On the good side though, I will have LOTS more time to devote to Wikipedia once I start my new job. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 22:53, 11 September 2005 (UTC)


==Wikijunior proofreading process==
I don't think it's a dumb idea at all! I'm glad you thought of it, it really got this project moving along. :) Maybe you could tell me what you think of my idea. I want to create a page called &quot;Pages needing images&quot; or something like that, for all current (and future) Wikijunior projects. For Solar System images aren't a problem, but for other modules there are either poor quality images on commons, none at all, or fair use or copyrighted images on the Wikipedias. Hopefully, we can get some good images, and it'll be another way for people to contribute. What do you think?
--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 00:58, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks, I actually didn't know WORD could do that. You're right, it is really hard to bring the reading level down. Even after I edited it to have simpler words and sentences, the reading level only went from 9.5 to 9.4. :( I really wish we could get our hands on some actual kids; this would be alot easier. :D--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 00:33, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:::I found [http://www.usingenglish.com/resources/text-statistics.php this website]. I think it also would be very helpful in bringing down the grade level.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 01:55, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
==Capitalization==
Hi,

Please use on Meta sentence-style capitalization, also in headers and page titles, that is the standard there.--[[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 21:12, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

==Missing information in Wikijunior==
I noticed that for Neptune, there's no section for how long a year is. When we're done proofreading, will we have a chance to add missing information to the modules?--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 19:41, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

:OK, I'll add it in now. Any idea on when's the latest we can finish all this proofreading? It seems like you and I are the only ones doing anything!--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 21:33, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

==October 3?!==
There's no way we'll reach that deadline without some help! I'm going to try to recruit people from the Simple English Wikipedia. I'll also see if I can get my silly brother and some friends to help out.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 00:11, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

==References==
When I'm copy editing the references, should I mention which specific section the fact came from, if possible? For example, if the reference was to the Wikipedia article on Pluto, and it was referenced for the size of Pluto, should I mention the section it came from? Or is leaving the whole article as a reference fine? --[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 05:02, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:Alright, I'll see if I can find some more non-wikipedia sources. But for most facts I have the NASA website and Wikipedia as references, so I guess all I have to do is just remove the Wikipedia reference.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 20:01, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::I've removed all Wikipedia references now. Pluto is just about done!--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 03:19, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Neptune and Uranus are done as well--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 00:20, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior Solar System]] ==

Can you point me at a couple of tasks I could do to help get the wikijunior Solar System book out? [[User:Pedant|Pedant]] 19:49, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

===Deadline===
Are we still trying to make the October 3rd deadline, or is there a new timeline? -- [[User:Rachel|Rachel]] 20:37, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

==Beck Foundation==
In answer to your question at meta, it's the John and Frances Beck Foundation. This was confirmed today by Michael Davis who checked the name on the $10,000 check they sent us. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 19:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

== On Copy Editing Solar System ==

sorry about the changes in your sentences on wikijunior: solar system , but the sentences I changed dont make sence gramatically. I understand they're for 8-12 year olds, but the book does not flow well the way those sentences are currently placed. I am also checking punctuation, Grammar, Spelling and such. Part of the copy edit is to make the book flow correctly, and currently (as a result of so many people working on it) it does not. Please share your thoughts
-[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 17:43 (UST), 31 October 2005

== Thanks ==

I really don't think that its nessasary to reopen copy edit, perhaps a final grade-level check would be nice, but don't you think that the most of the work was already done? I mean, the book flows well, it sounds reasonable for 8-12 year olds, and it has VERY few gramatical errors. I dont know, but maybe the page just wasent ready for the phase it was in when I found it. Your thoughts,

-[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]] 17:50 (UST), 1 November 2005

== Hi ==

No problem, ill find some other sources, but i mean i checked the data on wikipedia versus other sites and it seemed to be accurate. Just about every teacher i know will accept wikipedia as a credible source....so...... but anyway its not a problem

-[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]]

== HA HA Ok ==

Im really not trying to argue at all, and trust me i have read your profile.
-[[User:Basejumper123|Basejumper123]]

== Ok ==

I will set a source at each of the facts, can you just leave short messages in future? I dont need examples, and i dont need you to treat me as an inferior, ok?

== Copy of my response to [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity#Well written -- maybe too much for this book|your post re &quot;About weight and gravity&quot;]] ==

Thanks for your comments, SV Resolution. I agree that its all too easy for Wikijunior books to become overgrown, but this module [[Wikijunior Solar System/About weight and gravity|About weight and gravity]] is offered as a ''replacement'' for [[Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] (or, at least, most of a replacement). I feel a decision needs to be reached as to whether one or other of these modules is included, or none like them at all. I think there's a case for including such a module, as I've already come across areas in the book where it might usefully be referenced, e.g. the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Comets|Comets]] module which I have been (but have currently suspended) copyediting.  Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 12:26, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System]] ==

:'' Since you removed the &quot;this module is finished&quot; noticed, the module is getting &quot;unfinished&quot;.  Words are getting added.  The reading level is going up.  I am almost convinced that it is absolutely impossible to get an entire book ready for publication at the same time. Do you have any ideas on how to get a module proofread and then held static? Thanks for your thoughts.

:'' --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 02:01, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

I'd suggest something along the lines of the following. Have an administrator announce that a module is to undergo a final period of copyediting and proofreading, leading to a vote to protect that version of the module from further editing. All those wishing to take part in the vote have N days in which to register their interest. After that, once those who have registered to vote reach a consensus that the module is ready, the supervising administrator protects that version of the module and anyone else who has come along since (or who didn't register their interest, etc) will be editing what will/might become the next version of the module. Once this has occurred for all modules, you have a first (second, third, etc) version of the Wikibook for printing.

As regards my intervention in the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Solar System]] module, this arose because I have begun to work my way through the Wikijunior Solar System modules removing the adult-style superscripted reference numbers, URLs, etc from the text and replacing them with quotes from the text linked to the references in each module's separate References section. While beginning to do this for [[Wikijunior Solar System/Solar System|Solar System]] I felt there were some fundamental steps missing from the story outlined at the start of the module. If my attempt to insert them has created too demanding a text, I apologise and believe it should be possible to resimplify the text without losing them.

I ''am'' convinced that is impossible to declare an entire Wikibook &amp;ndash; even a Wikijunior book &amp;ndash; ready for publication unless something in the spirit of the above is agreed. Otherwise, yes, &quot;Maybe a wiki is a lousy place to write a book&quot;.

== [[Wikijunior Solar System]] ==

: ''Are you familiar with the process of rounding up admins, getting them to do stuff, etc?  I'm not.  If you want to propose a change in the finished project of the proofreading process, why not go ahead and do that.  Follow your own approach.  Do &quot;we&quot; agree on taking the references out right now?  How about on how to do that?  The nice thing about having them where they are is that they show which facts have been checked.&lt;br&gt;
: ''--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 01:16, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

A vote was started sometime ago [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#References.|here]] on how to treat referencing and as there has been no votes or comments against keeping them away from the text, I have forged onward. I believe young people prefer reading texts without superscripts or the like (see [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Footnotes|here]]). I'm aware that the format I'm implementing is less specific, but so far I feel it is still sufficiently specific to indicate the source/s of nearly each and every fact. Since most of the references I've parsed thus far refer to the same four or so sources per modules, I'm tempted to plan a second pass through them to remove such redundancy. I would however propose such an idea first.

I am more concerned that my efforts to copyedit (not proofread) the modules may result in sentences etc that are too demanding for our target audience. I would very much appreciate your (and anyone else) pointing out when you feel that has happened &amp;ndash; or, probably better, simply rephrasing it. Back on the [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System#Any target audience trials?|Wikijunior Solar System talk page]] (and perhaps elsewhere) I've enquired whether anyone has easy contact with a bunch of 7-12 year olds so we can benefit from some feedback. Elsewhere someone has mentioned they received a positive response from a (or maybe a few) young person/people but I'd like to feel reassured about the assumptions modules already make about young people's grasp of numbers, scale, history, etc, etc before I unwittingly add any more.

Meanwhile, I'm not familiar with the process of rounding up admins etc but if (or probably when) push comes to shove I'd sort out what to do and put what we've been discussing before them.

Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 03:18, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

== What is SIMPLE about? ==

If you are still interested, Simple English Wikibooks are books written with simple words and grammar. The project is still very young, it just got it's first sysop this week! The developers are (to my knowledge) working on a single log in for all wiki sites. I'll get you the link if you are interested. -- [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] ~

==Re: Unclesamwantsyou.jpg==
Hello, SV Resolution. Thanks for the message. I don't think I ever uploaded the image, so I unfortunately don't have any copies of it. I do recall, however, working with the image previously but can't remember how - how did you see my name attached with the image? I can't seem to remember now. If you need a higher resolution image, I would suggest checking with [[:en:User:Brian0918|Brian0918]], who uploaded it originally to Commons, or searching the Library of Congress archives. Good luck, and thanks! [[:wikipedia:User:Flcelloguy|Flcelloguy]] 00:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Stubs and categories ==

Hmm tricky one. The articles should have categories as well as stub categories. When I last looked the two hierarchies didnot correspond, so no automated solution was possible. Definitely, though, the stub category should not be thought of as a replacement, ersatz or place holder for a real category. These articles should have {{tl|uncatstub}} put on them.

This wikibook seeks to provide insight into the various issues specific to language books and help Wikibookians choose a style and structure to best aid the reader navigate the available contents and learn the material. 

This book is meant to detail '''guidelines, not rules''', on how to make an excellent wikibook teaching any language. You can pick and choose from all the suggestions this book has to offer and implement them in your wikibook to make it an effective and useful foreign language wikibook.

This book,&quot;Blended Learning in K-12&quot;, is an overview of the concept of &quot;blended learning&quot; and how it relates to the integration of technologies in the K-12 environment.  [http://publish.illinois.edu/scagnoli Dr. N.I.Scagnoli], the course instructor, has guided the students of the [http://cterport.ed.uiuc.edu/students_folder/CTER7 CTER 7 cohort]in the creation of this book.  This could not have happened in the 1980s.
(By way of explanation to non-Americans, [[w:K-12|K-12]] means all primary and secondary schooling).

== Introduction ==

 
While teachers have always used a variety of teaching methods and media, blended learning includes the recent availability of digital learning technologies and Internet-based tools that facilitate communication, interaction, and collaborative learning.  Neither e-learning nor the traditional classroom are ideal for all types of learning.  Blended learning offers the opportunity to incorporate the 'best of both worlds' to improve teaching and learning, to take &quot;advantage of the strengths of both learning environments and be more successful in avoiding their weaknesses.&quot; (Node, 2003)  Evidence from a study conducted by Alfred P. Rovai and Hope M. Jordan &quot;suggest that blended courses produce a stronger sense of community among students than either traditional or fully online courses&quot; (Rovai and Jordan, 2004).

The subheadings in this chapter will provide more information about blended learning, beginning with [[Blended Learning in K-12/Definition|What is &quot;Blended Learning&quot;?]]. This section will discuss what prominent authors in the field are saying about what blended learning really is.  While most authorities in the field agree on blended learning's usefulness, each author has a slightly different opinion about what makes a class &quot;blended&quot;.  Quotes will be used from these researchers, explaining their definitions in detail.
 
Blended learning has taken many forms since it was first created several years ago.  As blended learning evolved, its name and meaning also changed. It has been called hybrid learning, mixed mode learning, and several other names.  The second subheading in Chapter One, [[Blended Learning in K-12/The many names of Blended Learning | The many names of Blended Learning]], will discuss the countless names of blended learning, review each meaning, and look at how it has evolved into the term we know today. 

Finally, Chapter One will examine [[Blended Learning in K-12/Why is Blended Learning Important?|Why is Blended Learning Important?]].  Research from many educational areas will be used to show the merits of using blended learning instead of just traditional or e-learning environments.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Scagnoli. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Scagnoli~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Dr. Margaret Driscoll identifies four different concepts in defining blended learning '''The first defines blended learning as meaning &quot;to combine or mix modes of Web-based technology (e.g., live virtual classroom, self-paced instruction, collaborative learning, streaming video, audio, and text) to accomplish an educational goal.&quot;''' (Driscoll, 2002)  Other authors also define blended learning according to Driscoll’s first. For example in the introduction to &quot;Building Effective Blended Learning Programs&quot;, Harry Singh (2003) indicates blended learning models “combine various delivery modes. Anecdotal evidence indicates that blended learning not only offers more choices but also is more effective.&quot; 

Dr. Driscoll’s '''second definition describes blended learning as meaning &quot;to combine various pedagogical approaches (e.g., constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism) to produce an optimal learning outcome with or without instructional technology.&quot;''' (Driscoll, 2002) 

As Charles Graham points out in his introduction to the article “Blended Learning Systems: Definition, Current Trends, and Future Directions”, both of these first two concepts “suffer from the problem that they define BL so broadly that there  encompass virtually all learning systems.” (Bonk &amp; Graham, 2004)

The '''third definition from Dr. Driscoll (2002) defines blended learning as meaning &quot;to combine any form of instructional technology (e.g., videotape, CD-ROM, Web-based training, film) with face-to-face instructor-led training.&quot;''' (Driscoll, 2002)   Most authors echo this definition such as Gary Harriman, who indicated in his article, “What is Blended Learning” (2004), that “blended learning combines online with face-to-face learning. The goal of blended learning is to provide the most efficient and effective instruction experience by combining delivery modalities.&quot; (GrayHarriman, 2004) In addition, Judith Smith in her article, “Blended Learning: An Old Friend Gets a New Name”, defined blended learning “as a method of educating at a distance that uses technology (high-tech, such as television and the Internet or low-tech, such as voice mail or conference calls) combined with traditional (or, stand-up) education or training.&quot; (Smith, 2001) Simply put the Rochester Institute of Technology reported in the “Blended Learning Pilot Project: Final Report for the Academic Year 2003–2004” that &quot;blended learning aims to join the best of classroom teaching and learning with the best of online teaching and learning.&quot; (Rochester Institute, 2004) New South Wales Department of Education and Training (2005) echoes the above authors in the article, &quot;Blended Learning” by stating &quot;blended learning is learning which combines online and face-to-face approaches.&quot; (NSW, 2005)  Richard Voos (2003) also repeats this definition that blended learning is a combination of face-to-face and online media while he goes on to state that blended learning also results in &quot;seat time&quot; being “significantly reduced”. (Voos, 2003) Carla Garnham and Robert Kaleta (2002) identified blended learning or hybrid courses as joining the best features of “in-class teaching with the best features of online learning to promote active independent learning and reduce class seat time.&quot; (Garnham and Kaleta, 2002) Alfred Rovai and Hope Jordan (Aug 2004) in the article &quot;Blended Learning and Sense of Community: A Comparative Analysis with Traditional and Fully Online Graduate Courses&quot; indicate &quot;a blended course can lie anywhere between the continuum anchored at opposite ends by fully face-to-face and fully online learning environments.&quot; (Rovai and Jordan, 2004)  “According to Colis and Moonen (2001) blended learning is a hybrid of traditional face-to-face and online learning so that instruction occurs both in the classroom and online, and where the online component becomes a natural extension of traditional classroom learning.&quot; (Rovai and Jordan, 2004) e-Learning Centre's Library defines blended learning as &quot;a learning solution created through a mixture of face-to-face, live e-learning, self-paced learning as well through a mix of media – ‘the magic is in the mix!’ or ‘the beauty is in the blend!’ &quot; (e-Learning Centre, 2005)  The Australian National Training Authority’s (2003) “Definitions of Key Terms Used in e-learning” provides a definition of blended learning from Flexible Learning Advisory Group (2004) as “learning methods that combine e-learning with other forms of flexible learning and more traditional forms of learning. “

'''The fourth concept from Dr. Driscoll defines blended learning as meaning &quot;to mix or combine instructional technology with actual job tasks in order to create a harmonious effect of learning and working.&quot;''' (Driscoll, 2002)  This fourth definition gives an indication as to the popularity of blended learning as part of corporate training. &quot;Blended Learning is the latest buzzword in corporate training. Mixing e-learning with other types of training delivery.&quot; (Bersin, 2003)

There are other authors who have defined blended learning by combining Driscoll’s first and third concept. The Royer Center for Learning and Academic Technologies (2004) defines blended learning as intermingling “multiple learning strategies or methods with a variety of media. In contemporary terms, learning strategies and media typically include aspects of face-to-face instruction and online (or distance) learning, in combination with a rich variety of learning strategies or dimensions.&quot; (Royer, 2004)  From “The Node's Guide to Blended Learning: Getting the Most out of Your Classroom and the Internet” (2001), the Node Learning Technologies Network defines blended learning as learning that uses “multiple strategies, methods and delivery systems” including the “integration of multiple strategies, methods and delivery systems”. 

&quot;Good teachers have always used a mix of strategies, methods and media to reach their objectives–that’s not new. What is new is that today’s Internet-based tools can facilitate communication, interaction, and collaborative learning in ways that were not possible before. What’s also new is the relative accessibility of digital learning technologies and the ease with which instructors can blend them with classroom resources&quot; (Node, 2003).

Purnima Valiathan (2002) in &quot;Blended Learning Models” also combined the Driscoll’s first and third concepts of blended learning in stating that the term blended learning is “used to describe a solution that combines several different delivery methods, such as collaboration software, Web-based courses, EPSS, and knowledge management practices …  to describe learning that mixes various event-based activities, including face-to-face classrooms, live e-learning, and self-paced learning.&quot; (Valiathan, 2002)

In defining “blended learning”, a few authors concentrate on the word blended. As defined in The Concise Oxford Dictionary, 8th edition, to blend means to “form a harmonious compound, become one”. (Concise Oxford Dictionary 8th edition,1990) As Peter Isackson (2002) emphasizes, the definition of blended learning needs to focus on the &quot;blending&quot; of the methods and strategies and not just the &quot;tossing&quot; together of the different modalities. Isackson (2002) uses the analogy of good blending &quot;like a good Scotch whiskey&quot;; Royer Center (2004) offers additional analogies of blending as &quot;compared to gourmet coffees, wines, hybrid vehicles, and even gasoline. Each blend offers a variety of choices that form an appealing whole.&quot; (Royer, 2004)  In connection with these analogies the Royer Center (2004) goes on to explain that blended learning can have a variety of flavors and thus “there is no single approach for ‘how to blend’ ”, just as there exist different recipes for one type of food dish. “Successful blended learning, like a successful recipe, mingles a range of complementary ingredients in order to support the unique purpose of each learning event.&quot; (Royer, 2004)  Thus, as Isackson (2004) points out, “much of what people claim to offer today as &quot;blended learning&quot; isn't so much blended (like a good Scotch whisky) but &quot;tossed&quot; (like a salad).” There is the need to “distinguish between blended learning -- where there is a real input/output strategy and a dynamic structure -- and &quot;tossed learning&quot; where the form of input alternates.&quot; (Isackson, 2002)  As reported in “The Node's Guide to Blended Learning: Getting the Most out of Your Classroom and the Internet”, &quot;blended learning can be many things–there is no prescription and no recipe.&quot; (Node, 2003)

Finally, as there are a number of concepts for defining blended learning, Martin Oliver and Keith Trigwell (2005) in their article, &quot;Can 'blended learning' Be Redeemed&quot;, are critical of using the term at all. Oliver and Trigwell (2005) argue that the term ‘blended learning’ is “ill-defined and inconsistently used. Whilst its popularity is increasing, its clarity is not.” Oliver and Trigwell (2005) state that definitions of blended learning lack “an analysis from the perspective of the learner.&quot; Oliver and Trigwell (2005) suggest the need for a &quot;shift away from manipulating the blend as seen by the teacher, to an in-depth analysis of the variation in the experience of the learning of the student in the blended learning context.Along the same line as Oliver and Trigwell's (2005) criticism of the use of the term &quot;blended learning&quot;, Don Morrison (2003) writes, &quot;Personally, I’m much more comfortable talking about the strategic use of learning delivery channels than ‘blended learning’. Every enterprise has learning delivery channels—it's a question of identifying them and deciding which to use when.&quot; He continues by saying, &quot;I have heard blended learning dismissed as the Emperor's New Clothes on the basis that all learning—from infancy, through the classroom, and into the enterprise—is blended learning.&quot; (Morrison, 2003)</text>

|current=The many names of Blended Learning
|previous=Definition
|next=Why is Blended Learning Important?}}

Blended Learning has been around for many years, but the name has changed as the uses and recognition have increased.  Many people may be using a form of blended learning in lessons and teaching, but may not realize it or be able to give it an actual name.  Blended learning is something that is used in the world of education as well as the world of business.  Blended learning is not a new concept, but may be a new term to many users.  Below is a list and explanation of just a few of the more common, but older, names of blended learning.

&quot;You may hear blended learning described as “integrated 
learning”, “hybrid learning”, “multi-method learning” (Node, 2001).  &quot;The term &quot;blended learning&quot; is being used with increasing frequency in both academic and corporate circles.  In 2003, the American Society for Training and Development identified blended learning as one of the top ten trends to emerge in the knowledge delivery industry&quot; (cited in Rooney, 2003) (Graham, 2004).


== '''Blended Learning - Descriptions''' ==


Blended Learning: Learning methods that combine e-learning with other forms of flexible learning and more traditional forms of learning. (Flexible Learning Advisory Group 2004)

Blended learning (also called hybrid learning) is the term used to describe learning or training events or activities where e-learning, in its various forms, is combined with more traditional forms of training such as &quot;class room&quot; training(Stockley, 2005).

Blended learning is usually defined as the combination of multiple approaches to teaching. It can also be defined as an educational processes, which involves the deployment of a diversity of methods and resources or to learning experiences, which are derived from more than one kind of information source. Examples include combining technology-based materials and traditional print materials, group and individual study, structured pace study and self-paced study, or tutorial and coaching (Blended Learning, 2005).

Blended learning can be delivered in a variety of ways. A common model is delivery of &quot;theory&quot; content by e-learning prior to actual attendance at a training course or program to put the &quot;theory&quot; into practice. This can be a very efficient and effective method of delivery, particularly if travel and accommodation costs are involved. This mixture of methods reflects the hybrid nature of the training. (Stockley, 2005)

These explanations show how blended learning is viewed in different situations, different environments, and by different people.  As is suggested blended learning involves the use of some technology as well as the use of more traditional methods to allow the student to work and learn at his/her own pace.  Blended learning is a relatively new term.  However, the ideas of this style of teaching and learning behind it are more common.  The following is a list of synonyms or previous terms that are linked to blended learning.

== '''Hybrid Learning - Descriptions''' ==


&quot;Hybrid instruction is the single greatest unrecognized trend in higher education today&quot;—Graham Spanier, President of Penn State University (TLC, 2002).

Hybrid courses (also known as blended or mixed mode courses) are courses in which a significant portion of the learning activities have been moved online (generally 30 - 75%), and time traditionally spent in the classroom is reduced but not eliminated. The goal of hybrid courses is to pair the best features of face-to-face teaching with the best options of online learning to promote active and independent learning and reduce class seat time. Using instructional technologies, the hybrid model forces the redesign of some lecture or lab content into new online learning activities, such as case studies, tutorials, self-testing exercises, simulations, and online group collaborations (NJIT, 2005).

Using computer-based technologies, instructors use the hybrid model to redesign some lecture or lab content into new online learning activities, such as case studies, tutorials, self-testing exercises, simulations, and online group collaborations (TLC, 2002).

Hybrid courses seem to be the pre-step to blended learning.  Hybrid courses involve a great amount of technology.  They also greatly increase the independence of the student by allowing him/her to work at his/her own pace outside of the typical classroom.  this is obviously a synonym of blended learning as the explanations and ideas seem to differ very little from those of blended learning.

== '''Integrated Learning - Descriptions''' ==


Teaching strategies that enhance brain-based learning include manipulative, active learning, field trips, guest speakers, and real-life projects that allow students to use many learning styles and multiple intelligences. An interdisciplinary curriculum or integrated learning also reinforces brain-based learning, because the brain can better make connections when material is presented in an integrated way, rather than as isolated bits of information (ASCD, 2005).

ILS (integrated learning system): A complete software, hardware, and network system used for instruction. In addition to providing curriculum and lessons organized by level, an ILS usually includes a number of tools such as assessments, record keeping, report writing, and user information files that help to identify learning needs, monitor progress, and maintain student records (ASTD, 2005).

As stated by Node in the introduction, integrated learning is also seen as a stepping stone to blended learning.  This term shows a need for more methods of teaching than the traditional classroom can offer.  This is of course  the basis for blended learning.  Integrated learning allows a teacher to provided instruction to students in a way that will be meaningful and interesting to each learner.  This again is the main concept behind blended learning.

== '''Multi-method Learning or Mixed Mode Learning''' ==


As a capability, learning is often thought of as one of the necessary conditions for intelligence in an agent. Some systems extend this requirement by including a plethora of mechanisms for learning in order to obtain as much as possible from the system, or to allow various components of their system to learn in their own ways (depending on the modularity, representation, etc., of each). On the other hand, multiple methods are included in a system in order to gauge the performance of one method against that of another (Cognitive Architectures, 1994).

Node also mentions multi method learning and its connection to blended learning.  Again it is not a synonym of blended learning, but instead a stepping stone.  This shows a user how teaching outside the traditional box can and is more meaningful to learners.


== '''e-learning''' ==


&quot;e-learning is a broader concept [than online learning], encompassing a wide set of applications and processes which use all available electronic media to deliver vocational education and training more flexibly. The term “e-learning” is now used in the Framework to capture the general intent to support a broad range of electronic media (Internet, intranets, extranets, satellite broadcast, audio/video tape, interactive TV and CD-ROM) to make vocational learning more flexible for clients&quot; (ANTA 2003b, p. 5).


&quot;E-learning (elearning, eLearning) is the newer, more encompassing term for those activities previously described by the term &quot;computer based training&quot;. Computer based training has existed for many years now&quot; (Stockley, 2005).

e-learning is not a synonym of blended learning, but is a major component of a successful blended learning unit.  Without e-learning, there would be no real technology.  Without technology, there would be little hope of blended learning.  Therefore the concept of e-learning is a major aspect of blended learning and one that needs to be recognized and understood by those interested in blended learning.


== '''Flexible Learning''' ==


The provision of a range of learning modes or methods, giving learners greater choice of when, where and how they learn. See also Flexible delivery.

www.trainandemploy.qld.gov.au/tools/glossary/glossary_f.htm

Describes an educational regime providing pathway choices and learner control of the learning process.

www.lmuaut.demon.co.uk/trc/edissues/ptgloss.htm (Google Web, 2005)

&quot;The term flexible learning is referred broadly to mean increased learner choice in content, sequence, method, time, and place of learning.  In addition it is also  associated with increased flexibility in administrative and course management processes.  However it is interesting to note that most literature refers to online learning as only a form of flexible learning, but there is a clear emphasis on the use of online technologies to achieve flexible learning goals&quot; (VU TAFE, 2004).

Flexible learning aims to meet individual needs by providing choices that allow students to meet their own educational requirements in ways suiting their individual circumstances. Choices may be offered in: 

time and/or place of study 
- opportunities to study on- and off-campus or combinations of both; 

learning styles and preferences 
- the availability of a range of learning resources and tasks to suit individual needs; 

contextualized learning 
- the ability to tailor some or all of the learning content, process, outcomes or assessment to individual circumstances; 

access 
- flexible entry requirements, multiple annual starting points, recognition of prior learning, articulation between programs of study and cross-crediting arrangements; 

pace 
- unit completion on the basis of achievement of specified competencies rather than according to a pre-determined calendar; 

progression 
- flexible progression requirements and teaching periods allowing accelerated or delayed completion of study; and 

learning pathways 
- degree requirements allowing choice in programs of study. 

The student-centered approach underpinning flexible learning requires different teaching methodologies and also different relationship between teachers and students. In comparison to traditional educational models, flexible learning is broadly characterized by: 

- less reliance on face-to-face teaching and more emphasis on guided independent learning; teachers become facilitators of the learning process directing students to appropriate resources, tasks and learning outcomes. 

- greater reliance on high quality learning resources using a range of technologies (e.g., print, CD-ROM, video, audio, the Internet) 

- greater opportunities to communicate outside traditional teaching times 

- an increasing use of information technology (IT). Flexible learning is not synonymous with the use of IT but IT is often central to much of the implementation of flexible learning, for example in delivering learning resources, providing a communications facility, administering units and student assessment, and hosting student support systems. 

- the deployment of multi-skilled teams. Rather than the academics responsible undertaking all stages of unit planning, development, delivery, assessment and maintenance, other professionals are often required to provide specific skills, for example in instructional design, desktop publishing, web development and administration and maintenance of programs (Centre for Felxible Learning, 2005).

Flexible learning is the main concept and reasoning behind blended learning.  The point of creating blended learning was to allow flexible learning for the students.  This term then is also a major aspect of blended learning.  It needs to be recognized and understood by users in order to better create and deliver a blended learning unit to students.

As can be seen from the above examples and explanations, technology may not be a given to blended learning, but an addition.  Instead we need to look at blended learning as using methods outside the traditional classroom and teaching to help interest and reach all learners.  These methods could be using technology, or just some other form of teaching, like speakers or manipulative, to help all student learning, to reach all the students in the class.</text>

== Introduction ==


Although the term blended learning has moved to the forefront of educational jargon in the past few years, blended learning has been used for decades by educators at every level. In the pure sense of the term, blended learning simply means using more than one method of delivering a lesson to a student. But , in recent years, blended learning has been viewed as the combination of traditional face to face learning and technology, using whatever technology was prevelent at the time. This can include everything from calculators to televisions to computers and the Internet with all its advantages or disadvantages. 

During the course of the last fifteen years blended learning has evolved dramatically.  Both the number of educators teaching blended curriculums and the many different kinds of blends being used are a testament to the viability of these types of programs.  In this section of the wikibook we will examine the history and evolution of blended learning and its subsequent consequences.

== Evolution of Blended Learning ==


&quot;We learn anywhere, anytime, anyplace; there are opportunities to learn all around us everyday. We learn in the home, office, on the road. Likewise, educational content can be shaped to fit all kinds of useful delivery media that is convenient, user-friendly, and (most important) serves the educational need of members without the content being shortchanged or trivialized.&quot;  Smith,J.(2001)



Elliot Masie, in an Epic White Paper, answered the question What is Blended Learning? as follows: &quot;It [Blended Learning] is the use of two or more distinct methods of training.  This may include combinations such as: blending classroom instruction with online instruction, blending online instruction with access to a coach or faculty member, blending simulations with structured courses, blending on-the-job training with brown bag informal sessions, blending managerial coaching with e-learning activities.&quot;

So many of the commodities we take for granted today (telephones, washing machines, refrigerators) were new technologies not fifty years ago.  Similarly, according to Elliot Masie, we are almost &quot;lulled&quot; into thinking that e-learning is the first time that technology has influenced learning in any significant way.  &quot;That is a big mistake, as the internet is merely the culmination of wave after wave of technological innovation in learning.&quot; (Masie, 2003)

The first major innovation in learning technology was the advent of written language and the use of paper.  Many years later education was again revolutionized with the invention of the printing press.  Books became significantly less expensive and instructors no longer had to read the textbooks aloud to the students.  Broadcast media further changed the way educators taught by shrinking the planet and bringing diverse peoples closer together.  Consumer storage media such as the Audio-cassette, video-tape, and compact-disc allowed people to save more and more information while the PC and CD-rom brought a world of new software into the home and classroom.  Internet technology is simply the last component of a long line of technological innovation in education.  (Masie, 2003)

Can one imagine teaching- or living- without printed books or written language?  When the printing press was invented, did educators regard the printed word as a passing fad or did they lovingly embrace the new technology as something that could revolutionalize education?

Blended learning, especially that which involves technology use, was previously viewed as an adult learning environment. As more and more younger students are gaining access to computers and the Internet, this view is changing. We see blended learning at  every level of education. The higher the level of education, the less face-to-face interaction seems to be required.

We think it is the introduction of new technologies to the teaching and learning process that has brought blended learning into the limelight, and generated a recent, and growing literature base. Blended learning is also a term that has been used to differentiate some programs from the backlash against the sometimes inappropriate use of too much technology. (Cross, 2003:Driscoll, 2002)&quot; (Dewar, 2004)

== Invest in the Future ==

&quot;Obviously technology is going to be one of the major venues through which people will be learning in the future. This translates to how an association builds and reinforces its members’ professional needs as our society evolves into a knowledge management economy. People need survival skills to interact within the culture and society, in addition to the core needs. Training and education that involves technology (note — the word is &quot;involves,&quot; meaning includes — but not to the exclusion of all other kinds of learning) will need to be flexible as far as when and where it is taught, and the methods used. Blended learning offers associations that kind of flexibility.

Blended learning takes advantage of the power of technology to deliver training &quot;just in time,&quot; anywhere and anytime. However, in blended learning, technology (and in particular, online education) is not used as an isolated tool, but as a key part of a comprehensive workplace performance solution. Online education, therefore, is not considered the only means to educate, but it should be considered an adjunct to the overall education process.

If you are interested in seeing an example of a blended learning classroom scenario, check out the model at http://online.matc.edu/mktg-104/orientation.htm.&quot;(Smith,J., 2001)


For a comprehensive guide on how to integrate face to face teaching and technology visit the website listed below:
http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/learning/yrk12focusareas/learntech/blended/index.php. ( New South Wales, 2005)


Blended learning has traditionally been a part of the K-12 school experience. Business and industry has recognized that employees learn in different ways and schools move more in that direction each year. Mixing teaching methods and  varying the tools  used is what allows a greater number of students to be successful. Most institutions of higher learning are offering online courses or courses that offer a combination of face to face interaction combined with technological components. 

Blended learning is not a passing fad.  Nor is it a new name for something that's been around for a while.  Rather, e-learning is a technological innovation that, when successfully incorporated into the k-12 classroom, will forever change the way teachers teach and students learn.  E-learning has the capability to alter education in the same way the innovations of printing and televised media have.

K-12 schools are never the pioneers when it comes to such learning; they are the recipients of the trickle down effect. K-12 programs will be the last members of the education world to incorporate online education. Classes below the high school level require the largest amount of learning time  with face to face instruction. To be successful, students need to work from previous knowledge and the lower the grade, the more directed activities a student requires.Using technology, such as e-mail, Yahoo Groups, the Internet, a myriad of software programs are the latest tools K-12 teachers can add to a long list of blended learning venues they have always used.

A major stumbling block in incorporating e-learning in the K-12 curriculum has been the security issues surrounding the use of the Internet. Many parents still refuse to sign off on allowing their child unrestricted use of computers while they are at school. Schools spend a considerable amount of their funds to install filters and firewalls that attempt to block unsuitable sites, but they are not always successful. 

Universities and colleges that grant teaching degrees are investing more and more time in training new teachers to use the most up-to-date technology- &quot;teach the teachers&quot;, in an effort to advance technology training coupled with face-to-face instruction for K-12 students. For technology aspects of blended learning to expand, teachers, both new and experienced, must be prepared to change the way they have traditionally taught.


Despite the fact that K-12 blended learning has endless possibilities, more and more schools are being strapped with No Child Left Behind mandates and are finding funding shifted from expanding  computer access for students to needing more computers for bookkeeping purposes.


The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina has led to major changes in blended learning in K-12 classrooms in the areas most affected by this catastophic situation. With the displacement of many teachers and schools struggling to reopen, the quickest and most effective way to get schools up and running, with minimum staff,has been to create classroom and learning situations that include a greater amount of computer assisted learning. Industry has often partnered with school districts to provide  complete computer labs or smart boards for individual classrooms. Some industries have been involved in creating prep materials for standardized testing, often getting these contracts by providing needed computer hardware and software to school districts. Katrina presents a very different situation, where educators are forced to start anew and they are finding that the most cost effective means of reaching the most students in the best way is by incorporating technology into classrooms at every level (K-12).


==Life Experiences==


Just working in an elementary school in the computer lab has allowed me to see a side of blended learning that maybe not all teachers or scholars have seen.  In today’s fast paced world it is absolutely necessary for children (K-12) to be exposed to as many technologies as possible.  I am confident that time will make it more and more convenient for teachers to utilize technology in the traditional classroom setting, but it is certainly not going to happen over night.  When looking at the “Evolution of Blended Learning”, there is clearly not much research or years of study on the topic.  This is primarily because it is a new topic!  There is not a plethora of books and articles on the subject.  Since it is a new field of study, it will probably be several more years before the “evolution” is actually precise with any sort of factual timeline.  Therefore, we can only go with how it all began, and how far we have come.

Of course there has always been technology.  And over time, it has become more advanced to the point where we can do just about anything we want.  What is so wonderful about technology today, though, is that it has become a magnificent learning tool for children in school and at home.  It started with games.  Kids whose parents had enough money were able to have a computer at home with a black screen and green text, and were able to play a couple of simplistic games.  After a few years of that, there were colored screens with much more graphically advanced games (even though looking back we would laugh).  Some schools at the time had these machines, but it was still considered a “luxury”.  In computer class, simple games were played but there was still no World Wide Web.  In fact, the most basic functions of the Internet began in 1969 at UCLA.  It was invented for government purposes, and was never anticipated to be the colossal technology that it is today.  Now, with the press of a button, the world is at our fingertips.  In order for blended learning to become successful and incorporated into classrooms without “forcing” teachers, they must be educated on what technology will bring to their students.  

Looking at computer use, it is an absolute necessity (more and more everyday) for people to have the skills and savvy to compete and succeed educationally and professionally.  Many teachers still cannot turn on a computer, or find programs easily.  Some still struggle with email and the basic functions it entails.  This is the first step that must be corrected if blended learning is going to be functional.  Students cannot look to their teachers for guidance, if they know more about the subject matter.  It is embarrassing that many children help their teachers when they run into a computer problem.  It is rare to see students helping their teachers figure out math or science equations, and it shouldn’t be any different with technology.  Teachers should be thoroughly educated in computer knowledge equal to the grade level they teach, especially in the elementary grades.  The job should start in college when earning a degree in teaching, and then on-going technology education must be enforced by administrators and technology coordinators.  Once there is something solid in place, blended learning must be part of the curriculum.  It cannot be incorporated into a standard curriculum until the teachers are using what is available to them correctly.  If this is not the case, it can allow a class become less and less functional.  In order for blended learning to become a common term and knowledge in schools, is to start at square one and not insist on jumping ahead.  If done right, our children can benefit in ways that are unprecedented.  The evolution has only just begun.</text>

As stated previously, K-12 may be the last to utilize Blended Learning but it has certainly gone beyond the 'trickle down effect.' There is a growing trend to use technology in K-12 classrooms and more grants and financial opportunities are making Blended learning a reality. Because there are multiple tools available for use when incorporating ''Blended Learning'' in the K-12 classroom by a teacher, it is important to highlight what is available to create a blended learning environment.  According to &quot;Building Effective Blended Learning Programs&quot; by Harvey Singh, &quot;Blended Learning Programs may include several forms of learning tools, such as real-time virtual/collaboration software, self-paced Web-based courses, electronic performance support systems (EPSS) embedded within the job-task environment, and knowledge management systems. Blended learning mixes various event based activities, including face-to-face classrooms, live e-learning, and self-paced learning&quot; (Singh, 2003).

&quot;From a course design perspective, a blended course can lie anywhere between the continuum anchored at opposite ends by fully face-to-face and fully online learning environments.&quot; (Rovai and Jordan, 2004)  This chapter presents explanations of the various types of tools available to create a blended learning environment in the classroom.  The following categories will be used to organize major types:

#The use of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blended_Learning_in_K-12/Types_of_Blended_Learning/multimedia_virtual_internet Multimedia and Virtual Internet Resources] in the classroom. Examples include the use of videos, virtual field trips, and interactive websites.
#The use of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blended_Learning_in_K-12/Types_of_Blended_Learning/Classroom_Websites Classroom Websites] in the classroom. Included is a growing list of examples of useful blended learning websites. 
#The use of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blended_Learning_in_K-12/Types_of_Blended_Learning/Course_Management_Systems Course Management Systems]. Examples include the use of Moodle, WebCT and Blackboard.
#The use of [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blended_Learning_in_K-12/Types_of_Blended_Learning/Synchronous_Asychronous_Discussions Synchronous and Asychronous Discussions] in the classroom. Examples of resources available include Yahoo Groups, TappedIn, Blogs, and Elluminate.</text>

What are the main characteristics of Blended Learning? What makes blended learning unique, different, special?

The term “Blended Learning”, while popular, has been subjected to criticism, mostly because the definition lacks specificity. (See section 1.1 &quot;What is Blended Learning?&quot;)The term applies to diverse situations, including professional development in the business world, and technology integration in the K-12 and university settings, and describes a range of instructional practices. Indeed, one critical article has suggested that it is the very focus on instructional practices that is problematical, and that blended learning should instead focus on content from the learner’s, rather than the instructor’s, perspective. (Oliver and Trigwell, 2005) Although criticizing the terminology appears to be merely a discussion over semantics, the lack of specificity raises an interesting question: What are the characteristics of blended learning? 
A number of sources summarize the following characteristics as being unique to the blended learning environment.

*	[[Blended Learning in K-12/General Comparisons in Blended Learning|General Comparisons in Blended Learning]]

*       [[Blended Learning in K-12/Pedagogical Models- blending constructivism, behaviorism and cognitivism|Pedagogical Models- blending constructivism, behaviorism and cognitivism]]

*	[[Blended Learning in K-12/Synchronous and asynchronous communication methods|Synchronous and asynchronous communication methods]]

	Taking each of these point for point, we may attempt to characterize blended learning by examining its appearance point for point. In other words, by describing these blends as they should appear in a “real” context, we can begin to understand blended learning not as a textbook definition, but as a concept for learning and instruction in the Twenty-first Century.</text>

==Blended Learning by Design==

Instructional design can be defined as a process, &quot;It is the entire process of analysis of learning needs and goals and the development of a delivery system to meet those needs. It includes development of instructional materials and activities; and tryout and evaluation of all instruction and learner activities.&quot; (Applied Research Laboratory, 1996). A blended learning program will not succeed because it happens to include both online and face-to-face practices. It is the thoughtful, systematic process of instructional design using the combination of these elements that will facilitate structured development and lead to desired results.

&quot;Blended learning is hot and understandably so, combining the best features of online learning (e.g., 24/7 accessibility) with the best features of classroom instruction (e.g., live, face-to-face interaction). No doubt it’s here to stay. But why do so many blended initiatives turn into frustrating boondoggles, consuming far more time... than anyone anticipated?&quot; (Troha, 2002) Unfortunately, the undesired outcomes often appear during the implementation of the lesson, or even long after substantial amounts of time, effort, and enthusiasm have been expended. How can the practicing K-12 teacher avoid blended learning pitfalls? 

This section develops a model of best practices to reduce the potential headaches  and  realize the promise of  blended learning lessons. The importance of planning is reinforced. At each stage, control needs to be maintained from the beginning of the planning stage to ensure desired results.

Understand that before this plan can be implemented, some presumptions must be made. In order for a K-12 teacher to successfully apply this process to their own classrooms, they should have already designed successful traditional classroom lesson plans, prepared appropriate instructional documents (i.e. course syllabi, content-valid worksheets, etc.), and have an understanding of basic learning technologies. K-12 teachers may be familiar with creating a sound traditional lesson plan - one that includes a general description, its goals, objectives, activities, its practice methods and assessment. For many K-12 teachers, this is old hat. Incorporating technology into the lesson plan takes the design much further, still stating the goals and objectives, etc., but also assuming that the teacher has personally acquired skills to efficiently make use of the technology. These technologies should include models of instructional design and their most commonly used components, such as a word processor, a spreadsheet, communicating via email, and presentation creations such as Powerpoint. Without this foundation the information presented here will be less useful.

Three major, interrelated components comprise the recommended model for blended learning. They include a Lesson Design Process, Guiding Principles, and Success Tips. The lesson design process starts with gathering information that reveals the objective(s) of the lesson. It also includes a general outline which is used to guide the development of the lesson, its delivery and evaluation. The guiding principles provide perspective on the question “What’s the best mix of traditional, live, teacher-led presentation and synchronous or asynchronous, technology-driven methods of teaching?” {It is important to determine your role as a K-12 teacher in the learning process. Should it be one that is primarily directive or facilitative? Also, decide the importance of interaction amongst the students. These questions may be answered differently depending on the grade level being taught. In any event, blended learning lends itself to learner-centered, teacher-guided (as opposed to teacher-directed), interactive, and student-collaborative learning.}  Success Tips help establish and maintain communication between students and their teacher. It serves as a type of FAQ - a reference source for students. Included in success tips should be exemplary examples from previous students. These make for a wonderful resource for student success.

	While e-learning with no face-to-face contact may be a practical method of instructional delivery for college student, it is often not suitable for younger students.  When implemented correctly, blended learning can provide the best of both traditional classroom learning and the use of web-based resources more appropriate for students in grades K-12.  It should be noted, however, that in some cases, online learning for high school students is available, but also appropriate.  In a traditional classroom, blended learning provides elementary and high school students with direct contact with a teacher, while also utilizing resources that extend the learning experience beyond what is available in the classroom.  These resources include live synchronous experiences (video-conferencing, instant messaging, chat rooms, virtual classroom), asynchronous collaboration (e-mail, threaded discussions, online bulletin boards, listserve), and self-paced learning experiences (web learning modules, online resource links, simulations, and online assessment).
	School districts that encourage blended learning may realize benefits that include cost savings and the opportunity to provide unique learning opportunities to their students.  The following pages describe blended learning techniques which vary in their application based on the grade level for which they are utilized.</text>

Origami is the art of folding paper. The name comes from Japanese, adopted into English in the 1960s.

== Traditional Origami ==
Before 1900, there were several isolated folding traditions which seem to have developed entirely separately:

In Europe, the first folding traditions were not with paper but with cloth. Napkin folding traditions appeared in the 16th century, and were very well documented, though aside from some simpler forms they were discontinued during the 1800s, due to the time and effort involved in folding cloth. Paper folding emerged as a form of chidren's recreation and a pedagogical tool, particularly during the 19th century and later. European folding generally uses 45º angles, and used mostly squares or rectangles. &lt;ref&gt;Joan Sallas, &quot;Gefaltete Schönheit&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folding traditions are for the most part associated with the practice of burning paper objects at a funeral, as a way of providing for the deceased in the afterworld. As a result, there is an emphasis on inanimate objects; gold ingots, or yuenbao, are a common subject. Other uses of folding included auspicious animals such as the frog or turtle.

Traditional Japanese origami had its beginnings in the formal gift-wrapping practices of 17th century Japan, and by the mid-18th century it was an established and recognizable tradition. Several origami books were published in Japan during the early 19th century. Contrary to modern practice, it often used cuts, and implemented a variety of starting shapes: squares, rectangles, octagons, hexagons. Japanese traditional repertoire uses 22.5º angles extensively, and used more sculptural shaping than other traditions.[[File:Tsuru wiki.svg|thumb|Crane, Japanese traditional model]]

The pedagogical methods of Friedrich Froebel, developed in the 1840s and 50s, included paper folding to teach geometry and encourage imaginative play through interpretation of folded objects. During Japan's industrialization process, parts of the German education system, including Froebel's kindergarten method, were adapted for use in Japanese schools. The folding styles were assimilated into Japanese origami, and laid the ground for future developments. The restrictive use of squares with color on one side is credited to Froebel's influence. &lt;ref&gt;http://origami.ousaan.com/library/historye.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Origami ==

During the early 1900s, several Japanese folders started creating and publishing their own origami designs, notably Akira Yoshizawa, Kosho Uchiyama, and Toshie Takahama. Akira Yoshizawa's innovations in particular sparked an era of expanded exploration, and many origami artists credit him as the founder of modern origami. He was the first to create origami as sculptural art, and introduced a number of major technical innovations: backcoating, where two sheets are pasted together to combine the properties of both; wetfolding, where a sheet of thick paper is dampened before folding to loosen the fibers, allowing for better manipulation of the paper; a method of diagramming, which was expanded upon by Samuel Randlett, and now referred to as the Yoshizawa-Randlett diagramming system; partial folds and creases, used for sculptural effect; and in general a greater level of complexity and liveliness.

(more to come: origami after world war II in America and Europe, technical origami movement, modular and tessellation genres, etc.)

===3...f5===
:Black offers the f pawn.  White's best response is to simply support and develop with 4.d3.  The resulting position is similar to a King's Gambit Declined with Black playing the gambit with less development -- not very comfortable for Black, but White must still play carefully.

:Key themes for White at this point are to attack Black's kingside using the light bishop and to resist attempts by black to simplify the position via exchanges.  Exchanges involving White's light bishop are particularly suspect.

:The best advice for Black is to not play this gambit as it is considered to be refuted.

== Overview ==

'''''Accio''''' is the Summoning Charm; it can be used to bring an object to the spell-caster. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

There are two instances in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|fourth year]] where he is witnessed using this spell (outside of classes and practice or homework). First, in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] to Summon his Firebolt [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|broomstick]]; and secondly, to retrieve the Triwizard Cup when dueling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

In his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|sixth year]], Harry tries to use this spell to retrieve his wand after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] has put him in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Petrificus Totalus|Body-Bind]] Curse on the Hogwarts Express; he fails because he is not holding his wand. Harry later uses this spell in an attempt to Summon the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]] from the middle of the lake in the cave, but is intercepted. Again he uses this spell in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] to Summon some of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Madam Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]]'s brooms, on which to fly to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

In his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|seventh year]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] use this spell a number of times to bring things to them, or try to. Some objects, such as the Sword of Gryffindor, prove unresponsive to this charm; Hermione suggests that there are ways of preventing the Accio charm from working.

There are various other instances where this spell is used by other characters.

== Analysis ==

The name of the object can follow the spell word; Harry uses that form, as &quot;Accio Firebolt&quot;, to summon his broom. It seems that is an aid to concentration, as the spell-caster should be concentrating hard on the object being summoned. Early in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] uses the unadorned &quot;Accio!&quot; to relieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins]] of the prototype charmed sweets they are carrying, before they set off to the Quidditch World Cup, which shows us that naming the object being Summoned is not always necessary.

Despite its apparent simplicity, the Summoning charm is apparently fairly complex. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 19|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], we learn that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] has assigned several books on the subject for homework, and Harry has significant trouble with it, being unable to master it until immediately before the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/First Task|First Task]]. After the Task is completed, Professor Flitwick apparently thinks it worth discussing the Summoning charm with Harry. Flitwick apparently feels that Harry's charm was performed perfectly, which, along with Flitwick's desire to discuss it, would lead us to think that this charm is seldom performed correctly.

One has to wonder what could make this apparently simple charm such a major concern. One possibility is that the charm requires a complete awareness of what it is that you are summoning, where it is, and where you want it to end up. This would be particularly true when the item being Summoned, like Harry's broom, is out of sight. We have already determined that many spells, notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portus|Portus]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|the Patronus charm]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|Riddikulus]], require a significant mental exertion; so it is not unlikely that the Summoning charm, and probably the analogous [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Banishing Charm|Banishing charm]], would also require significant mental effort. It is entirely possible that the use of the name of what one is summoning is merely an aid to concentration; that it is the mental image of what one wishes to summon that is the determinant of whether this charm works or not.

==English?==

The Spanish speaking contributor makes a couple of very valid points, especially the arguement about the Sphinx possibly being far older than formerly believed.  But most kids reading an English language Wikibook no hablan Espanol....

:It would be useful to transfer some of that spanish language text to the [[es:Wikichicos|Spanish Wikijunior]], although the Ancient Civilizations Wikijunior book has not been started there.  Translating this text (even through Babelfish) would be useful for this article at the moment.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:35, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

==Question==
&quot;The abundant water of the Nile River allowed vegetables to be grown almost all year round except summer.&quot; Is this correct? If so, we should elaborate. [[User:Kfasimpaur|Kfasimpaur]] ([[User talk:Kfasimpaur|talk]]) 22:58, 10 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Phoebe.png|right|220px|Cassini image of Phoebe]]
Phoebe is a moon of Saturn.

==How big is Phoebe?==
Phoebe is about 220 km wide. However, because Phoebe is not very spherical in shape, it is wider in some places and narrower in others.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Phoebe is dark and heavily cratered. Craters are up to 80 km across, one of which has walls 16 kilometres high.

==How long is a day on Pheobe?==
One day on Phoebe is equal to 9 h 16 min 55.2 s on Earth. Unlike the other moons of Saturn, Phoebe does not have '''synchronous''' orbit. This means that the time it takes for Phoebe to rotate once is different from the amount of time it takes for Pheobe to orbit once around Saturn.

==How long is its orbit around Saturn?==
One orbit around Saturn is equal to 550.6 days, or 1 and a half years!  Phoebe's orbit is '''retrograde''', meaning it moves in the opposite direction of moons such as Rhea or Titan.

==What is it made of?==
The dark colour of Phoebe led scientists to believe that it was a captured asteroid. However, recent pictures from ''Cassini'' show that Phoebe's craters vary greatly in brightnes. This means that underneath the dark surface, there is a large quantity of ice. In addition,quantities of carbon dioxide have been detected on the surface, something which has never been found on an asteroid. It is believed that Phoebe is around 50% rock, unlike the other moons of Saturn, which are about 35% rock. For there reasons, scientists now think that Phoebe is a captured Centaur, an icy '''planetoid''' from the Kuiper Belt that orbits the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune.

==How much would Phoebe's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on Phoebe, you would weigh only 1/25th of what you do on Earth! For example, a 100 lb person on Earth would weigh only 4 lbs on Phoebe.

==Who is it named after?==
Pheobe is named after a Titan in Greek mythology. She was the grandmother of Apollo and Artemis, and mother of Leto and Asteria.

==How was it discovered?==
Phoebe was diacovered by William Henry Pickering on March 17, 1899 from photographic plates that had been taken starting on August 16, 1898, at Arequipa, Peru by DeLisle Stewart. It was the first '''satellite''' to be discovered photographically.

----

The piano, attributed to Bartolomeo Cristofori of the eighteenth century, is a popular keyboard instrument widely used in western music for solo performance, chamber music, and accompaniment, and also as a convenient aid to composing and rehearsal. The piano produces sound by striking steel strings with felt hammers. These vibrations are transmitted though the bridges to the soundboard and projected acoustically through a soundboard. The piano has long been a crucial contributor to many musical genres, from classical to contemporary.

The word piano is a shortened form of the word &quot;pianoforte,&quot; which itself is derived from the original Italian name for the instrument, &quot;clavicembalo col piano e forte&quot;--literally &quot;harpsichord with soft and loud.&quot; This refers to the ability of the piano, unlike the harpsichord, to produce tones at different volumes depending on velocity with which its keys are struck.

==History==
[[File:Bartolomeo Cristofori.jpg|thumb|right|Bartolomeo Cristofori di Francesco, the inventor of the pianoforte.]]By the 1650s, the harpsichord and the clavichord, two predecessors of the pianoforte, were arguably among the most used instruments in Europe. Composers at the time were upset with not being able to control musical dynamics, or, in simpler terms, the ability to make certain notes louder than others. By the eighteenth century, Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) created a mechanism by which dynamism could be achieved. Over time what he called the pianoforte gained traction, and soon made its way to upper- and middle-class families.

By the beginning of the 19th century, piano manufacturers experimented with piano assembly, thus greatly reducing the selling price of the piano. The famous 1920s saw piano coming into popular culture with musical styles different from that of the traditional classical pieces of music. The Great Depression, however, decreased the popularity of the piano and many piano manufacturers went out of business. But by the 1940s, the piano underwrote a rival of sorts, and the baby grand piano (smaller pianos) became extremely popular as a cheaper and more encouraging option to middle-class families.

By the 21st century, keyboards increasingly began to replicate the sound of acoustic pianos, and, just as baby grands in the 1940s, began to stand as another option, and continues to do so today.

==Mechanics==
As a keyboard stringed instrument, the piano is similar to the clavichord and harpsichord in that all produce sound by causing strings to vibrate and are operated by striking black and white keys. The three instruments differ in the mechanism of sound production however. In a harpsichord, strings are plucked by quills or similar material. In the clavichord, strings are struck by tangents which remain in contact with the string.

In a piano, the strings are struck by hammers which immediately rebound, clear of the vibrating strings.  Unlike the clavichord and harpsichord, the piano has mechanisms called a &quot;dampers&quot; to prevent the strings from vibrating indefinitely or causing sympathetic vibration in other strings.  Each key on the piano has a felt damper that rests against the strings to stop unwanted vibration.  When a key is struck, the corresponding damper pulls away from its strings, allowing those strings to vibrate freely until the key is released and the damper falls back on the strings for that key, stopping the vibration and thus stopping the sound. This, along with the ability to produce both loud and soft noise makes the piano the responsive and expressive instrument we love today and is one of the main reasons the piano has far surpassed the clavichord and harpsichord in popularity.

==Significance==
The piano is a crucial instrument in Western classical music, pop, jazz, rock, film, television and electronic game music, and most other complex western musical genres.  It has also become the main instrument in many churches, supplementing or even supplanting the traditional church organ. Since a large number of composers are proficient pianists, the piano is often used as a tool for composition, such as solo piano pieces. Beethoven's &quot;Fur Elise&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, Mozart's &quot;Turkish March&quot;, Chopin's &quot;Prelude In A Major&quot; and ragtime pianist Scott Joplin's &quot;The Entertainer&quot; are some popular pieces for piano. 

Pianos were, and are, extremely popular instruments for private household ownership, especially among the middle- and upper-class. Pianos have gained a place in the popular consciousness, and are sometimes referred to by nicknames, including: &quot;the ivories&quot;, &quot;the joanna&quot;, &quot;the eighty-eight&quot;, and &quot;the black(s) and white(s).&quot; Playing the piano is sometimes referred to as &quot;tickling the ivories&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The best way to learn to play the piano is, like most other things, practicing at it daily or at least regularly. At first it is good to practice scales and chord cadences. 
To put your right hand in the position to play the C-G notes, put your fingers on the keyboard in the order shown in the image below:
[[File:Piano keys.gif|frame|left|(Your thumb is 1, your little finger is 5. String players' note: 1 does not start on your index finger.)]]

You should memorize the notes in relation to black keys: B is not the seventh key from C, but it's the key on right side of the three black keys. 
Additional, you should sit at the front of the bench (or chair, although it is recommended for you to get a piano bench or something that resembles it) and place the middle c key right in front of your bellybutton. The middle c key in the keyboards containing 61 keys is the white key after 3 sets of black keys (meaning that you'll count ten black keys starting from the left and put the white key right before the black one to the right in front of your navel) For regular pianos (88 keys), add an extra 6 black keys to the set of ten.

Sit down and play around for a bit; experiment, have fun.  (Keep your wrists straight and relaxed.)  It's best to have a real piano for this, but if one isn't available, at least make sure the keyboard you're using has touch sensitivity.

Your wrists should be straight and but your hand should be relaxed. Let your arm fall to your side, relaxed and parallel to the keys. Make your hand into a fist and then extend your fingers straight. Then relax and let your fingers fall. The result is the correct hand position. Of course this is only the starting position, in real playing it immediately flies out of the window. A relaxed hand has fingers that are slightly curved, a bit like how a hand looks resting over a computer mouse. This will allow you to play the black and white keys easily.  
The first things you'll probably notice (if you don't know already) is that keys on the left are low, and keys on the right are high; also that playing two adjacent keys simultaneously sounds dissonant.

The number of keys may seem overwhelming at first, but their organization is simple -- they're in a repeating pattern of octaves, one of which is pictured above.  Try finding one of the '''C''' notes in the middle of the keyboard. Now play another '''C''' above or below it -- you'll hear immediately why they have the same name.

The black keys are chromatic notes and used when the key requires notes that sound 'in-between' what you get when playing on the white keys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many and varied reasons to play the piano. It is a beautiful instrument with a beautiful look and a beautiful sound. It can be a soloist's instrument or a group instrument. It sharpens the mind and body. The gift of music is therapeutic. There are many careers that require piano skills. The list goes on and on.

One quality that the piano and not many other instruments share is that you can play more than one note at a time. It is polyphonic. Thus, unlike instruments like the flute or violin, one can play pieces with complex and rich harmonies when playing alone. That makes the piano a '''dynamic solo instrument'''. At the same time, the piano '''sounds beautiful accompanying other instruments'''. So, whether you are introverted or extroverted, the piano will suit your style.

Unlike wind instruments like the flute or tuba, the piano leaves the voice free to '''sing along'''. Unlike the violin, any notes that sound out of tune can not be blamed on the performer. As long as you engage a piano tuner at least once a year, each note will '''always sound in tune''', regardless of your skill level. 

Playing the piano also develops a high level of '''manual dexterity'''. While it may seem very simple to just push the keys, learning to perform complex pieces with precision AND emotion needs a little time and a very human touch. That is one reason why professional pianists have not been replaced by computers. It is more complicated than patting your head while rubbing your tummy! But it is ever so much more rewarding too!

The piano is also a staple of '''family sing-along''' - whether you are singing Christmas carols or playing some favourite movie tunes. The very design of the piano lends itself to groups of people gathered around, singing along. This is one of the most social of activities. This is where some of our warmest and most treasured memories are made. 

Recently, research has shown that children who learn the piano do far better '''scholastically''' than their fellow students. Not only are their artistic and musical skills above the norm, but also their language and mathematics skills are also improved. While this benefit is sometimes difficult to measure, piano students also receive a very tangible benefit. Many schools are recognizing the achievements that children make in piano and reward them with '''high school credits''' when they pass certain grade levels. In Alberta, Canada, passing a recognized piano exam level/grade 6, 7, and 8 is worth 5 credits each for a total of 15. When you consider the fact that one needs only 100 credits to graduate high school, this is a huge recognition.

Pianists also learn some basics in '''posture''' which can reap huge rewards. For one thing, the basic hand position required for the piano is also the one required for the typewriter/keyboard. Considering how vital the computer is these days, learning this technique is invaluable. With the proper hand position, one can '''avoid carpal tunnel syndrome''' that is plaguing our modern-day offices now that computers are being used so extensively. At the very least, the basic concept of sitting tall in a chair will help with basic posture and back pains.

Anyone aspiring to be an orchestral or choral '''conductor''' is required to study the piano. Learning the piano trains the pianist to understand and hear the interplay of the various harmonic lines in each piece of music. This is a vital skill for a conductor who must hear and guide all the instruments of his/her orchestra and voices in his/her choir.

If you go to colleges which teach music, or if you are applying towards a degree in music or you want to learn to master an instrument at a university it is necessary to take a year or more of piano. Piano is a really good music classroom teaching tool and is the key and basis to learning music theory. With a bass or a guitar, you might make beautiful chords, but there are cases in which many people have no idea what these chords theoretically are or what is it that they are playing. Instead, piano aids in music by providing a structure that makes sound, but to make such sound beautiful you must know what you are doing. This is not to say that guitarists or other players never know what they do! Rather, piano aids in the composition and greater experimentation with music. Since the piano differs from the guitar or wind instruments in which the person usually memorizes digital and finger patterns, the piano uses both hemispheres of the brain, requiring your ten fingers to be controlled independently! This might sound hard but with practice and time you'll be able to even do more than one thing simultaneously. A piano player who decides to play drums, if skilled enough can pick them up more easily than someone who hasn't had the experience to play such instrument.

Moreover, There are many '''jobs and careers''' for pianists. One can be the piano player in a lounge, on a cruise ship, in a church (mass, weddings, funerals), or in a band. One can be an instructor with a college or university or teach out of a home studio. One can accompanying vocalists, choirs, violinists, and others as they perform for competition or for an audience. One can compose movie scores or commercial jingles or orchestral pieces. The possibilities are endless.

The ability to play a musical instrument and to express one's self with a musical instrument is very healthy and '''therapeutic'''. Stresses can melt away. The piano is always there, ready for you to pour out your soul. It is a most patient and agreeable companion. If you're upset, go ahead and thunder away on the keyboard, and when you're done and feeling better, go ahead and pick up a more languid or cheerful piece.

And, of course, '''a piano is a beautiful addition to any living room!'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">In elementary piano, the left hand (lower notes) typically plays chords, while the right hand plays the melody.  If you're playing pop or rock and singing, you might want to play the chords with the right hand and the bass note of each chord with the left hand.

The first chord to learn is '''C Major'''.  (Major chords tend to sound cheerful while minor chords may sound sad or cool -- this varies, though, depending on context.)

[[image:piano-Cmajor.gif]]

Now move the top two notes up by one key each: this is '''F Major''':

[[image:piano-Fmajor.gif]]

[Notice that the chord is composed of three notes, C, F, and A. While this is still a F Chord, it is not in it's &quot;natural&quot; state. C Major, is composed of C, E, and G and has a normal, 5, 3, 1 left hand finger pattern. This chord is in its &quot;natural&quot; state, the state of not being inverted. This means that we take the degrees or 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of the scale to compose the chord. Whenever a chord follows the pattern that C Major does, it is a regular chord. F Major, which follows a different pattern, is called an inverted chord (second inversion). Every chord has 3 different patterns. The regular pattern, which looks like the C Major chord above. 1st Inversion (not shown) means that the first note of the chord, (for example, let's use the C Major chord, in which the first note is C) goes to the top of the pattern (So you play, with finger 5, E, finger 3, G, and finger 1, C.) Second inversion, which looks like F or G Major, involves putting the next note (still using the C chord, E in this case) on top of your fingering pattern (played finger 5, G, finger 2, C and finger 1, E). Using inversions helps you to play chords quicker without having to constantly move your hand. Take note, though, that different inversion produce different sounds, so pick the one that is best for your situation.]  

You can play a surprising number of songs with just these two chords!

Now move all three notes up: '''G Major''':

[[image:piano-Gmajor.gif]]

Practice moving between C major, F major, and G major -- you can combine them in lots of ways.  Most pop songs, and many rock songs, rely on these chords heavily.  See if you can figure out &quot;If I Had a Million Dollars&quot;:

 '''C'''      '''G'''             '''F'''                           '''C'''
   If I had a million dollars (If I had a million dollars)
 
        '''G'''             '''F'''                           '''C'''
    I'd buy   you   a house  (I would buy   you a house)


Keep in mind that when playing the C chord, for example, you don't have to play the ''c'' below the ''e'' below the ''g'' -- you can put them in whatever order you want, perhaps playing the ''g'' an octave below, then the ''c'', then the ''e''.

[[image:piano-Aminor.gif]]

Now that you have '''A minor''' (take a C Major chord, and move the top note up), you can play a good proportion of pop tunes.  Green Day's ''When I Come Around'' is a canonical example -- it's nothing but a repeating loop: C Major, G Major, A Minor, F Major, then back to C Major.

 '''C'''          '''G'''                '''A&lt;small&gt;min&lt;/small&gt;'''  '''F'''
    Well I  heard you crying loud
    All the way    across    town

Here are some other chords, for reference:

*Bb (''B-flat'') Major: Bb&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  D&amp;nbsp; F
*Eb Major: Eb&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  G&amp;nbsp; Bb
*D Minor: D&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  F&amp;nbsp; A
*E Minor: E&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  G&amp;nbsp;  B
*D Major: D&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  F#&amp;nbsp; A
*E Major: E&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  G#&amp;nbsp; B
*A Major: A&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  C#&amp;nbsp; E


==How to learn chords==
A solid understanding of scales will make learning new chords easier. Check out the section on [[Piano/Scales|Scales]] for further information. A basic major chord is formed from what is called a triad. A triad is the first, third, and fifth notes in a scale (eg. the C chord = C, E, G). Therefore, if you know the scale, you can easily learn a new chord from playing those three notes of the chord. Minor chords are played in a similar manner. Play the first, third, and fifth notes, but take the third note and drop it one half step (a half step is one key, including black keys, so Cm would be C, Eb, G). This is a minor chord. If you also have been paying attention to some of the information on the sections that discussed intervals you can also have an alternate way of creating chords without needing to use the scale.

===Advanced Chord Structures===
Sometimes, when looking at chords, you will see something that looks like C7, Cmaj7 or Cdim, etc. (by the way, it does not have to be a C chord) These chords (all chords, in fact) are based around the triad that we talked about earlier. to play a 7th chord, simply play the seventh note in the scale (with the triad), but drop it by one half step. To play the major 7th is even easier. All you have to do for a Maj7 is to play the seventh along with the original triad. a diminished (dim) chord is a bit more difficult to learn at first, but will soon become second nature. To play a diminished chord, play the triad, but instead of playing the second and third normally, play the second as you would in a minor chord (dropped one half step) and also play the fifth dropped one half step. Think of it as a &quot;minor minor&quot; chord. Also, a diminished chord is often played with a sixth (eg. Cdim = C, Eb, Gb, A). There are many other types of chords which will be discussed a bit later. A diminished chord can be derived from the fact that it is compressed between a frame of two intervals in which there is a third minor and there is a diminished 5th involved. Diminished 5th, diminished chord. This is a good way to recognize chords by ear when played separately or when you know most of your intervals by ear. There are other types of chords that are a bit easier to construct, such as the augmented one. It is called Augmented because the augmented interval is the 5th. So for example, in the c major scale, the regular pattern for this chord would be the notes c, e and g#.

To summarize:
{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 align=center
|-
! Chord !! Major modification
|-
| maj7 || add a seventh
|-
| 7    || add a flatted seventh
|-
| minor || flat the third
|-
| dim   || flat the third&lt;br&gt;and the fifth
|-
| aug || sharp fifth
|}

==Practicing Chords==
Learning chords are good for memorizing, sight-reading and helps you to learn theory. They're helpful in improvisation too.

1. By now, you have hopefully learned what diminished, augmented, minor and major chords are and how they are built. If you have, that's great! If not, please scroll back up and review.

2. The chords in the following steps should be played in both hands at the same time in root position. Always say the name of the chord before playing the chord.

3. On every note of the chromatic scale play major, minor, diminished and augmented chord. Example: C-major, C-minor, C-diminished, C-augmented. Then go to C# and do the same and continue to the next C. Then descend.

4. When going up, black key chords are sharps (#) and when going down they are flats (b).

5. Do this every day; it takes only few minutes.

6. When you can do this easily, practice with your eyes closed. Try to feel the groups of three and two black keys. Speed is not your goal now: Just feel those chords. You don't have time when sightreading to look for chords.

7. Add a bit of fun to the style you practice. Try getting songs that use the chords you know and play along with the songs. its a great way to practice.

8. It may seem that this is boring work. It is, that's why you are doing it only few minutes a day. In a half year you will know about chords more than most people who have been playing for several years.

9. When you have learned most common chords, that's it. Later, only when you need to, you can learn the rarer chords.

=An alternative way=
1. Do you know where the F is? It's on the left side of three black keys. Play it with your pinky of left hand.

2. Play A with your middle finger and C with your thumb. What you play (assuming you haven't stopped playing the F) is called the F major chord. This chord only has white keys in it. Memorize this and all the other chords that we deal with. Don't progress too quickly, spend some time with every step.

3. Move the pattern up so that you play the C with your pinky. This is the C-major chord.

4. Move up to G, and play the G-major chord. By now you have mastered the major chords that only have white keys. Try playing a simple song in C-major using only using these chords. It may not sound the greatest piece in the world, but on some very useful level  it works really well. You can even improvise on these three chords. A tip: use only white notes for the melody. Please, use some time to play with these chords.

5. Next we're going to master the chords with one black key in the middle. Put your pinky on the D, but this time put your middle finger on the F#. This is the D-major chord. Continue to A and E and repeat.

6. The next chord, B-major has two black keys: D# and F#. Play B with fifth finger, D# with third finger and F# with thumb.

7. The next chord is the only one that has three black keys: the F#-major. It also has double personality: it's also a Gb-major. Can you play the chord with out any guidance? Excellent. The major chords have a special pattern: The root note (played with your left hand's pinky), then three keys between the next note (middle finger), then two keys between (thumb).

8. Db-major, Ab-major and Eb-major have two black keys. The white key is in the middle.

9. Bb-major has a black key followed by two white keys. You have now mastered all the major chords. All the others are just variation of it.

10. To create minor chords, simply lower the middle note by one key. To create C-minor from C-major, play Eb instead  of E.

11. To create diminished chords, lower the upper note of minor chords by one key.

12. To create augmented chords, raise the upper note of major chords by one key.

== Pop examples ==
Like most rhythms that are out there, pianists always have their job. For most pop, a sustain pedal is used. The sustain pedal on a regular piano is usually the one to the rightmost side of the set of the (two or one) other pedal(s). For most of the pop songs the piano uses a passive style, in which you usually play a chord like this: (left hand): C. (right hand) c, e, g two times, before moving on to a different chord. add a bit of playing to your style. you can use the pedal, pressing it when you play the chord, and releasing it as soon as you play a different chord, then pressing it before you release the keys. This is why piano involves coordinated (feet) and hands. You can also try a bit of syncopation, in which you might play the chords with your left hand and then with your right hand, both chords not at the same time but one after the other. The faster you do it the more coordination you are going to have to use. Now that you have hopefully experimented a bit with these styles, lets move out onto something else.

=== Practicing chord changes and chord inversions ===
As you might have been reading above, you don't really need to move your hands much when accompanying. Try doing this simple exercise to practice chord inversions and chord changes:

Left and right hands play the same chords, either syncopated or together, the choice is yours.
*start with the c major chord in the natural or fundamental state (c, e, g)
* In this case, we will raise the g to an a to form an A minor chord with first inversion (c, e, a).
Note: you can play and discover many inversions that you have never thought off before. People who have been playing for a long time have a lot of incidental but awesome discoveries like this one almost daily!
* next we will move the root and the middle notes up by a key so that we play a d minor chord in its natural state (d, f, a)
*finally for this round, we move the upper two notes (f and a) to be g and b, so that we obtain a second inversion of the g chord.

Practice this round until you are finally ready for the next one. If you can play these chords maybe at the speed of every half a second per each one, then you can move on to the next round.

*the c major chord is played in first inversion (left hand: e5, g3, c1; right hand: e1, g2, c5)
*next, the middle note moves up a step and we end up with a second inversion of the a minor chord--cool huh? and it doesn't here! (left hand: E5, a2, c1; right hand: e1, a3, c5)
* next, we move our root and last note up, so that we obtain a minor d chord in its first state (left hand: f5, a3, d1; right hand: f1, a3, d5)
* finally, we move our root and middle note up, so that we play the g major chord in a natural state as well. The fingering for this  chord is the same as the one for c major in natural state.

Alright, we are almost through the three rounds of chords which mean 3 chord inversions! if you practice these two I am sure you will be more than ready for the next round.

* we will then move from the g major chord the two upper notes, so that b and d become c and e and we get a c major chord in its second inversion (left hand: g5, c2, e1; right hand: g1, c3, e5)
* next, we just move our root up, from g to a, getting an a minor chord in natural state (left hand: a5, c3, e1; right hand: a1, c3, e5)
* then we will just move the middle and last note up, so that we get a d chord in its second inversion (left hand: a5, d2, f1; right hand: a1, d3, f5)
* at last, we move the first and last notes so that we have a g major chord in its first inversion (left hand: b5, d3, g1; right hand: b1, d2, g5)

Ok, now that you have all of these three rounds practice them all in one. That means, you will start with the natural inversion for the  c chord and end at the first inversion of the g chord. If you have done the three rounds, keep going up. It wouldn't sound that great like it did at the beginning. repeat the exercise until you are comfortable with it. Have fun--add different styles to it if you can play with rhythm. If you are brave enough or want to experiment even more, use your left hand to play these chords only and make up a melody (with the white keys only) to improvise.

== Chord progressions ==
This as you might have noticed is a chord progression. Chord progressions as you can easily deduce that they are &quot;circles&quot; of chords (or harmonic circles) which are played over and over during a song. This is what makes up many of the catchy tunes you might hear. This chord progression has the notation I-VI min. II-min. V. What this all means is characterized by roman numerals. as you might notice, the scale has numbers from 1 to 7. So in the c major scale we start with the c major chord (which is the number I, or also known as tonic) and then we go onto the 6th note of the scale by having an a major chord (VI min.) Note: Min. or Maj. usually follow the roman numeral. Then we go on with a second minor chord (d minor, II in.) and finally we end with the 5th grade or note on the scale (g major, V). Usually, the progressions are hyphenated like this. A really common chord progression which is a jazz one but also used in many songs regardless of genre or style is I-IV-v (c, f, and g major chords in the scale of c). Sometimes they might be in this order or in different orders. There are different progressions to specific styles.

=== Pop chord progressions ===
In a vast variety of pop songs, the following progression is used (often known as the &quot;four chords&quot;):
I - V - VI min - IV

C, G, A minor and F. 

=== Folk chord progressions ===
In folk, there are two major and distinguished progressions. The major chord progression is as follows:
I - IV - ♭VII - I

C, F, B♭ and C again. Note that all these chords are major.
For the minor progression there is a slightly different chord.
i - ♭VI - ♭VII - i.
So, the chords on the c minor scale would be the following:
c, A♭, B♭ and c. There are many other progression like this but for now I suggest you practice these and stick to them. Who knows, they might come in handy some time.

=== Adapting Piano Chords for the Keyboard ===
Piano chords can also be played on an electronic keyboard.  In order to have fluent chord playing with the Left Hand the notes of the chords are rearranged (see chord inversions above) to be played between the notes F and F.  In the key of C Major, the three chords C, F and G would be played in these inversions C (5G 2C 1E), F(4A 2C 1F) and G (5G 3B 1D). Practice playing the chords using these fingerings. Once you have learned the three basic chords Am (4A 2C 1E) and Dm (4A 2D 1F)can be added.  The G chord could be extended to G7 (5F, 4G, 2B 1D).  You will be able to play many tunes and songs with knowing just these basic chords.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The scales and the piano=

There are many different scales in music, from pentatonic scales (&quot;oriental&quot; sounding scales) to major scales which are more common in Western music.

==Why Learn the Scales?==

Learning the scales is like learning the ABC's when learning to read: not so exciting, and it doesn't get a lot of practical use in everyday life, but trying to learn piano without learning the scales is like trying to learn to read without first learning the alphabet. It can be done, but the &quot;shortcut&quot; only winds up handicapping a novice player. The counter-argument has been made that the scales mainly use fingers 123, which are already technically strong compared to fourth and fifth fingers, which are weak because of anatomical limitations. This argument's weakness, however, is in realizing that the purpose of learning and practicing scales has little or nothing to do with strengthening fingers 1,2, and 3 - although this is a pleasant benefit. Practicing scales with rigid tempo and in a legato (connected) style helps lay the foundations of rhythm and fluidity of motion.

The scales are essential, because 99% of music is built on them. One can find the scales, or portions thereof, in songs of every complexity, from the simplest one-note rendition of &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; to the complicated classical pieces and even almost all modern songs.

When one plays the melody of &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; in C major, you can be pretty sure that it doesn't have a wild bluesy part with a lot of black keys. OK, we exaggerated a bit, but we were still very very close. Try to play &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; on black keys only. You can make it, and when you can do it, you probably can do it forever. It's easy to remember to only use black keys after all. Conclusion: Scales are very good help in memorizing. If you remember the key of your piece, memorizing eases.

When you try to play some piece by ear, and you have figured out that it is in major key, the rest will come a lot easier. You will now know that the black keys aren't the first candidates for the right notes, if you want to play it in C major. Or if it sounds bluesy, you will presumably need some &quot;blue notes&quot;, which you can always find in blues scales (there are various). Conclusion: Knowledge of scales is good for playing by ear.

When you play in parties, and you've finished your highly virtuosic piece and everybody is fascinated by your playing (the situation is fictional, it doesn't happen for real), somebody brings to you sheet music for some piece. But then you see, it has six(!) flats. This is no problem for you, because you instantly know it's either Gb major or Eb minor and what the black and white keys are. And then everybody at the parties considers you as a miracle. Conclusion: Knowledge of scales is absolutely essential for sight reading.

==What scales are==

In music, a scale is a set of musical notes in order by pitch, either ascending or descending. Western music is divided into whole and half steps. A half step is the distance from one note to the very next note, including black keys. For example, D to D#, Ab to G, or B to C. A whole step is two half steps. For example C to D, E to F#, or Ab to Bb. ALL SCALES RELY ON WHOLE AND HALF STEPS! 

If you play any C and play all the white keys up to the next C, you have played the C major scale ascending. Do it backwards and you have played it descending. The scale you have played has a special pattern, what makes it sound major. It's 1-1-½-1-1-1-½. 1 stands for a whole step and ½ for a half step. Try to use 1-1-½-1-1-1-½ for every possible key; it always works; it creates a major sounding scale. Resorting the order of whole and half steps creates different sounding scales -- different modes -- as can be seen below. 

Playing C major's relative minor A minor, just start from A and play all the keys up to next A. This scale is actually A natural minor scale. The notes and their order are the same, the start and end point is different. Then start from some other key than A or C. This scale isn't major or minor, it's another mode. Major and natural minor are, in fact, just different modes of each other. In the table below are all the modes. Don't memorize, if you don't want to, the only reason they're there is to help you to understand what minor and major really are. Major and minor just &quot;killed&quot; other modes. But, for example, phrygian mode is still used in flamenco, and all of the modes are used in modal jazz.

Why do major and minor sound so different? Why are the major and minor modes used so much more than the others? The answer lies in chords. So called I IV V chords in major are all major chord. In C major they are I = C major, IV = F major and V = G major. In A minor they are i = A minor, iv = D minor and v = E minor. Note: the roman numerals for minor chords are lower case. The other modes are more odd. You can harmonise many pieces using only I, IV, V or i, iv, v. Or improvise on them: just play something only using the notes of the scale and its I, IV, or V. If anything feels confusing, visit [http://www.musictheory.net/ Ricci Adam's Musictheory.net]. It's a free site with easy to follow animations.

Each scale degree has a name. I is called tonic, II is supertonic, III is mediant, IV is subdominant, V is dominant, VI is submediant, VII is leading tone. For example, in the key of C Major, if you are referring to the G note, which is the fifth scale degree, you would call it the &quot;dominant.&quot; 

 Table of scaledegrees:
 
 I       - Tonic         - First (and most important) note of the scale
 II      - Supertonic    - Second note of the scale
 III     - Mediant       - Third note of the scale
 IV      - SubDominant   - Fourth (and third most important) note of the scale
 V       - Dominant      - Fifth (and second most important) note of the scale
 VI      - Sub Mediant   - Sixth note of the scale
 VII     - Leading Tone  - Seventh note of the scale
 (VIII)I - Upper Tonic   - First (and most important) note of the scale


===The different minors===

The difficulty with natural minor scales lies in the fact that there is a whole step between the 7th and 8th notes in the scale. The 7th note in the major scale gives a very strong sense of leading to the final pitch, a desire to 'resolve' the sound back at the root (tonic) pitch, since there is only a half-step between them. But the natural minor scale does not contain that. The harmonic minor scale includes a raised, or form of the 7th scale degree. So in our example in A minor, the 7th scale degree would be raised from G natural to G sharp (# is the symbol for the term 'sharp'.

But doing this added a new difficulty--the distance between the 6th and 7th scale degrees was now more than a whole-step (the musical term for this distance or interval is an 'augmented second'). This sound was not pleasing to composers, and it can be difficult to sing as well, so a new minor scale, the melodic minor, was introduced, which involved raising both the 6th and 7th scale degrees as you ascend (move up in pitch from lower to higher tones), which shortened the distance of that unusual interval back to something more common and easier to sing. However, when you are descending (moving from higher pitch to lower pitch), it is not necessary to have the 6th and 7th scale degrees raised, since you are not leading immediately into the tonic pitch. So, using our example, the A melodic minor scale would be as follows: (ascending) A-B-C-D-E-F#-G#-A (descending) G natural-F natural-E-D-C-B-A. You may also notice then that the melodic minor scale (ascending) only differs from the corresponding Major scale on the third scale degree: A Major includes C#, whereas A melodic minor includes C natural.

==List of things to practice with scales==
All major scales, harmonic minor scales, melodic minor scales and natural minor scales (natural not so important):

Hands together, hands separately, four octaves, two octaves, ascending, descending, ascending and descending, stacatto, legato, tenuto, crescending, decrescending, softly and loudly and everything between, rhythmic variations, contrary and similar motions.

==Fingerings for the major and minor scales==

Few different schools exists (in no particular order):

1. Always use fourth finger on the black key.  (More specifically: fourth finger on Bb with the right hand, and fourth finger on Gb with the left hand.)  

2. &quot;Orthodox&quot; Hanon-fingering

3. Same fingering to every scale

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and congratulations on the &quot;How to Build An Excellent Wikibook Teaching Foreign Languages&quot; Wikibook. However, you may consider moving it to your user page (that is, moving to &quot;User:Mijokijo/How to Build An Excellent Wikibook Teaching Foreign Languages), as this project is probably more of a personal project than a Wikibook. (This, of course, doesn't mean we can't get it colloborated on). 

On another note, what languages do you speak? As a fellow interested Wikibookian I am concerned about the state of some foreign language Wikibooks (I've written a substantial part of the [[Portuguese]] Wikibook. However, some books like [[French]] are almost stagnant. If you are interested in helping me with some of these books, then please leave a note on my [[User talk:Serge|talk page]]. Once again, well done on your critique of foreign language Wikibooks. Much to ponder! Cheers - [[User:Serge|Serge]] 08:27, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Program installation ==

=== Install java ===
openbravo POS is an application developed in java and to execute it you will need the Sun Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2 or greater. 
====On Windows====
You can install Java from [http://www.java.com/getjava/ Sun's website]
====On Ubuntu====
Ensure to have the multiverse repository activated and type
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-fonts&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Download and unpack openbravo POS ===
Download the last version of the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=127939&amp;package_id=243077 binary package of LibrePOS from Sourceforge], open it with your favourite decompresser and extract all the files to an empty folder.

=== Run it! ===
In windows execute the file  &quot;start.bat&quot;, in Linux execute &quot;start.sh&quot; to make sure everything is running correctly. openbravo POS should display a warning alerting that it has found an empty database. Click OK to create the database structure necessary to run LibrePOS.

At this point you should decide whether you want to run LibrePOS on the built-in HSQLDB engine or, alternatively Database_configuration|use the MySQL or PostgreSQL databases

== Database configuration ==

LibrePOS supports four database engines: [[w:HSQLDB|HSQLDB]], [[w:MySQL|MySQL]], [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]] and [[w:Oracle_database|Oracle]]

LibrePOS uses HSQLDB by default for data storage. HSQLDB is bundled with the binary package of LibrePOS and offers an advantage in that it doesn't have to be configured. However, a lot of users choose other relational databases for performance or reliability.

To configure the database go to the configuration panel or run the file &quot;configuration.bat&quot; in windows or &quot;configuration.sh&quot; in linux. ''Please be aware that once you restart LibrePOS, it will tell you that your database is empty and will offer you to create tables for your new database''. This is normal. Click the 'yes' button to allow LibrePOS to create the tables for you (In LibrePOS version 0.0.24 there should be 26 tables).

The properties related to the database configuration are:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#000&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
! Driver library
| Is the file provided by the database engine vendor that contains the JDBC driver that allows Java programs to comunicate with the database. It is usually a JAR file.
|-
! Driver class
| Is the java class name that implements the JDBC driver. This name is also defined by the database engine vendor.
|-
!URL
|Is the connection string that uses JDBC to localize the JDBC the driver and the database.
|-
!User
|The name of the authorized database user.
|-
!Password
|The password of the database user.
|}
=== MYSQL ===
====On Windows====
Download [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#win32 MySQL server] (essentials package recomended) and install it.

Download [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html MySQL Connector/J], unzip the contents and place it in the same folder where LibrePOS resides.

Alternatively you can install all-in-one packages that include also [[w:Apache_HTTP_Server|Apache]], [[w:PHP|PHP]] and [[w:phpMyAdmin|phpMyAdmin]] like [http://www.wampserver.com/en/index.php WAMP Server] or [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html XAMPP]
====On Ubuntu====
Activate the universe repository and do
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysql-java&lt;/pre&gt;
You can also install phpMyAdmin
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin php5&lt;/pre&gt;
Connector/J is on /usr/share/java/mysql.jar. You can copy or link it to LibrePOS' folder
====Usage====
Create an user and a database.
You can check [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/ MySQL documentation]
An example of a database configuration using MySQL as database engine is:

 Driver library: mysql-connector-java-3.1.6-bin.jar
 Driver class: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver  
 URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tinapos
 User: yourname
 Password: yourhost

=== PostgreSQL ===
To use LibrePOS with PostgreSQL you must have a PostgreSQL server running and the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL. 
====On Windows====
[http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/ Download the server] and 
[http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html#jars get the JDBC 3 driver according to your version]
====On Ubuntu====
Ensure you have the universe repository activated and do
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.2 libpg-java&lt;/pre&gt;
You can also install administators like pgAdmin3 or phpPgAdmin
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install pgadmin3&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get install phppgadmin php5 php5-pgsql&lt;/pre&gt;
The JDBC lib is on /usr/share/java/postgresql.jar. You can copy or link it to LibrePOS' folder
====Usage====
After the database server is installed and running you have to create an empty database for LibrePOS and a database user with privileges to connect to this database. 
You can check [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/index.html PostgreSQL documentation]

An example of a database configuration using PostgreSQL as database engine is:
&lt;pre&gt;
 Driver library: postgresql-8.0.309.jdbc3.jar  
 Driver class: org.postgresql.Driver  
 URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/tinapos
 User youruser  
 Password: youpass
&lt;/pre&gt;
===Oracle===
Download and install [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/xe/index.html Oracle XE] and the [http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html JDBC Driver]
====Usage====
An example of database configuration is
&lt;pre&gt;
 Driver library: ojdbc14.jar
 Driver class: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
 URL: jdbc:oracle:tinapos:@localhost
 User youruser  
 Password: youpass
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">LibrePOS is a point of sale system for retail trade. Supports ESC/POS ticket printers, customer displays and barcode scanners.

LibrePOS uses a relational database as its persistant storage. HSQLDB is used by default but MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL are also supported. 

The system is internationalised and currently supports Spanish, English, German, Portuguese and Italian. Other languages can be added easily.

It allows for the creation of multiple user accounts. Accounts are assigned roles in order to determine their capabilities. You can have as many roles as you need, but the default ones are Administrator, Manager, User and Guest

The main application window is focused on the sales operation. The interface is designed to operate with a touchscreen so that a keyboard and mouse are not required for normal operation. On the other hand, it is possible to interact fully with the application using a keyboard and mouse without the use of a touchscreen. 

The restaurant management features includes a visual display of tables which includes a visual cue to indicate which tables are occupied or free. It is easy to set up this layout to correspond to the physical layout of the restaurant. 

There are administration options to manage users, set passwords and configure other aspects of the application. 

There are management options to make closings, to manage products and to manage the organization of products into categories. It has reports and charts of products, closings and sales.

== Programming languages ==
Does this include '''programming''' languages? ;)
:Well, I suppose most of it could work out that way, but I'm not sure if repetition is the best way to teach someone how to do a while loop :\ --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 12:35, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

== Mentioning exceptions ==
When there are exceptions for cases, they should be mentioned. Bad habits ensue from ignoring exceptions and it is more difficult to rectify habits than it is to prevent them. If you are unwilling to teach it, at least explain succinctly.

The two worst mistakes of teaching a language (in order of magnitude) are merely stating sentences with translations and being linguistic in explanation.

Using splash screens is akin to using leetspeek. The lack of its usage doesn't raise the intelligence and its usage affirms the underlying's suck.

However, these are merely my opinions.

:Please feel free to modify the book with those and other additions to the guidelines. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 02:07, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

== IPA and etymology ==

I had an excellent Spanish instructor for a semester of college. Along with teaching the musical-rhythm (similar to the sound of a Jack-in-the-Box) she explained the physical motions of producing vowels and the etymology of the vocabulary. Additionally, IPA representations are helpful to the literate.

== Splash/Intro Screen ==

Now, I personally dislike Splash/Intro screens, but I don't think they really say anything about the wikibook per se. For instance, both the French and German wikibooks use splash screens, but I wouldn't say that they are bad wikibooks; they are probably some of the better wikibooks in their genre, but the splash screens need to go :P --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 00:32, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

:I don't understand your reasoning.  Flash screens don't make a book better but they do make it look better and we must remember that this kind of thing is more important for Internet media than traditional print media.  Would you prefer to read something which is just lines of unformatted text or read the same thing enhanced by a few relevent pictures?

== Templates ==

The template I uploaded lastnight is pretty half-baked. I'll improve it later today, but at least it gives an idea of what I have in mind for a good looking curriculum. When I was working on it I also got the idea of prominent contributor recognition, which I'll add to the guidelines. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 13:30, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

==Move to Help namespace==

This page, although useful in trying to set out some guidelines, is not a textbook itself and really shouldn't be in the main namespace. It does seem suitable for the Help namespace, and so I'm moving it there, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

==&quot;Mental picture&quot; dictionaries==

In a book &quot;How to Learn Any Language,&quot; by Barry Farber, there was a chapter about making up little stories to remember vocabulary. For the [[Russian|Russian Wikibook]] I made a ]]Russian/Lesson 4|mental picture dictionary]. For example, the Russian word for &quot;house&quot; is Дом, or &quot;dom.&quot; The &quot;mental picture&quot; is &quot;You know how Russian churches have onion domes? Russian houses have the same domes.&quot; You visualize all Russian houses with onion domes.

Another example that any &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; fan will remember is that &quot;good&quot; in Russian sounds like &quot;horror show,&quot; so Alex and his &quot;droogs&quot; (Russian for &quot;friends&quot;) say &quot;Horror show!&quot; when they like something.

On the [[Talk:Russian/Lesson 4|Talk]] page, someone was shocked&amp;#151;SHOCKED!&amp;#151;at the nonsense I'd written. My Russian professor also discouraged us from using &quot;mental pictures,&quot; although she said it's OK when you first learn a word.

On the other hand, both of my Russian tutors loved it. They had a lot of laughs at the strange things I'd tell them that &quot;all&quot; Russians&quot; did, e.g., stealing tables, putting chairs in their attics, never taking off their shirts outside so they'd have white bellies, etc. :-)

I realize that this may be a radical idea to some, but I'd be happy to add a section about this to &quot;How To Build An Excellent Wikibook Teaching Any Language.&quot; No textbooks have &quot;mental picture&quot; dictionaries. If Wikibooks offered &quot;mental picture dictionaries&quot; they would be better than other textbooks. Plus this is something readers could easily contribute, as they learn vocabulary or make a funny connection to an English word or phrase.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 18:28, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

: This idea has been proven to work well for some words but can't be applied to all. Also it's very important to just use it as a hint to remind yourself, not as a definite guide to the pronunciation.

: The [[BLL German|Bite-sized language lessons for German]] encourage users to contribute such mnemonics for vocabulary and grammar within the lessons themselves. [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 09:15, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

::People will never agree about what methods are best and all the suggestions on here are just ideas and not foolproof methods.  As for learning the Russian or Polish word 'dom' I'd have thought that thinking of 'domestic' would be the easiest way to remember the word? [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:11, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

== Learning a language Section1.16.1 ==

Not everybody learns a language the same way. In fact, research has shown that learning how to construct a sentence and conjugate verbs can prove frustrating and some people learn better when they are given second language video or audio material, in context. They see and hear how the language is used as it's used.
Though I didn't know how to construct sentences, memorizing dialogs in my earliest language classes helped me learn vocabulary words and memorize a sentence structure I could use in the future.

== Move back to main name-space ==

I believe the topic has far too much nuance than can be covered on a single help page and deserves to be a book in its own right. I propose that we move this back to the main name-space. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:56, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

:I totally agree and moved it. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:01, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

== Books trying to be curriculums ? ==
The section on 1-2-3-4-5 Punch contains the remarks: 
:Many wikibooks for languages are '''trying to be curriculums''' rather than textbooks or references. This is an excellent goal, but to achieve it you must plan your curriculum, and repetition is key to any curriculum.
I know some time has passed since this was written, but does anyone understand what the author was driving at exactly? Is he / she drawing attention to idiosyncratic content with the idea that departing from established standards is a risky approach? Or is it something else? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 20:18, 21 July 2010 (UTC)

::The way I understood this sentence was that many language wikibooks (and language courses in general) just take the whole content they want to present and split it up into lessons, such that each lesson covers a part of the whole content (e.g. a particular grammar topic or a particular communication situation like shopping). And this is very much what a curriculum does: you decide what to teach and then split it up and order it in some way. There are several reasons why this approach doesn't work very well for language books (depending on the kind of topics you choose) but the main reason it cannot work is that presenting any language topic just once and then not reviewing it systematically will almost always fail to teach the topic to the reader. Without systematic review, most people cannot learn anything. Thus, the content of the lessons has to overlap, the very same topics have to be reviewed in multiple lessons, over and over again. For a curriculum it is fine to take the whole content, split it up and order it in some way. For a language textbook, this approach cannot work. At least that's my understanding of this sentence. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 18:08, 22 July 2010 (UTC)

:::Yes, that is a problem with many of the books still. So we can say those books are like curriculums in their present states of development. I expect this happened unintentionally, rather than being a conscious objective from the start. Perhaps they need a big table or spreadsheet showing how the grammar etc is allocated to the lessons. It sounds like a good deal of work would be needed though! [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:55, 22 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hello World==
The very simplest program in VB is this:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
  Public Sub Main()
      MsgBox(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
To create this do as follows:

* Start VB
* A ''New Project'' window will appear. Select ''Standard.exe'' and click on ''Open''.
* Open VB's ''Project'' menu and click ''Add Module''
* Copy or type the Main subroutine shown above into the new code module.
* Go to VB's ''Project'' menu again and click the ''Project1 Properties'' item (it should be the last item in the menu).
* In the ''Project Properties'' dialog box you should find a dropdown list labeled ''Startup Object'', click there and choose ''Sub Main''
* Go to the ''Run'' menu and click ''Start'' (or press F5) to run the program.  VB might ask if you want to save, just say no this time.

The running program will show the words '''Hello World!''' in a small message window.

==The Visual Basic Integrated Development Environment==
The Visual Basic '''Integrated Development Environment''' (IDE) is a program from Microsoft used to create, test, and deploy Visual Basic (VB) programs. VB programs can be written using other text editors, which must then be converted to executable code (compiled and linked) by the programmer.  The VB IDE allows a programmer to write code and test it immediately, converting the source program to executable code as needed (on the fly).  As the name implies, creation, editing, compiling, and linking are all integrated in this development environment.

The top of the IDE window shows VB's menu bar (see screenshot).  Common menu categories (File, Edit, Help, etc.) as well as items specific to creating code (Project, Debug, Run) provide the text interface for the IDE.  Commonly used menu items are provided as toolbar buttons directly below the menu bar. 

[[Image:Vb6_screenshot_1.jpg|thumb|A screen shot of Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Integrated Development Environment]]

Two parts of creating a program; designing the user interface using forms and controls, and writing the source code; take up the majority of space in the IDE.  As initially configured, four dockable windows also appear in the IDE's application space; the ''Project Explorer'', ''Properties Window'', ''Form Layout Window'', and ''Toolbox''.  These and other supplied windows may be floated above the IDE, or docked to the sides, top, or bottom of the IDE application space as may be convenient for the programmer. Clicking on the title bar of a dockable window and dragging it around will dock, or undock, the window at will.

===Availability===

As of April 8, 2008, Microsoft no longer provides support to the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ms788708/] Nonetheless, Visual Basic 6 is still available via MSDN subscription, under the name of &quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;.[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/229868/how-to-compile-legacy-vb6-code]

===Visual Editing===
VB programs are divided into two views, the visual design of the user interface, and the code editors. The visual interface is created by adding controls from the ''Toolbox'' to the ''Form Layout Window''. To add a control to a form; click on the desired control in the ''Toolbox'' and then click and drag its bounding rectangle on the representation of the Form in the ''Form Layout Window''.  When you release the mouse button after the click and drag operation, the selected control will appear on the form. 

Clicking on a control, or the form, in the ''Form Layout Window'' highlights the control (or form) with sizing handles. You can use the sizing handles to change the Left, Top, Height, and Width properties of a control or the Height and Width properties of a form.  A highlighted control can be dragged to other positions on the form simply by clicking on the control and dragging it into place.  A highlighted control can also be copy and pasted to reproduce additional identical controls on the form.  Clicking and dragging around multiple controls (a lasso operation) will highlight them all as a group, which can then be moved as a group, or copy and pasted as a group, as may be needed.

===Code Editing===
Code editing is done using the code module windows. The title text of a code module window shows the project and module name. Two dropdown lists show the objects accessible to that module (General) and the subroutines (Declarations) associated with the selected object in the General list. In a form's code module, the General list will list all of the controls that have been placed on the form.  Each control has its own set of events and methods, which will populate the Declarations list upon selection of any control.  These two windows combined help the programmer locate specific code for events and methods in the program.  In small programs, the editors can be scrolled up and down to find a desired routine to work on.  In large programs finding the right spot can be much more difficult, where these two lists bring the programmer to the desired location using a few clicks of the mouse.

The code editors will show the program as one long text document, or it can show the program a single routine at a time. The two buttons in the lower left of the code module window allow the programmer to set his/her view preference.

The code editors can be split into two views by moving the small bar in the upper right of the editing area. The two views show two different views of the '''same code module'''.  Again, in larger programs, it may be helpful to see one section of the code in the module while working on another area of the code in the module.  The split view mode allows the programmer to keep one section of the code in view while creating a new method or function.

===VB Project Files===
Code modules and forms are saved individually as text documents in the project folder.  The filename extension (.xxx) is used to identify which type of module the file contains. The project file (.vbp) describes the project as a whole, naming the individual files needed to create the program.  With VB installed correctly, double clicking on a project file will bring the entire project into a new instance of the VB IDE, while double clicking on a form (.frm) or module (.bas) or class (.cls) or control (.ctl) file will load that individual file into a new instance of the IDE.  Typically, loading a single file from a multi file project (other than the project file) will not have all the information required to allow the program to run.  However, in many cases, short test code, code written to test out some small idea, is best kept in its own module (and file) where it can be loaded and discarded at will.  Such code can be added, removed, or edited, until it is perfected (debugged) and copied into the real program modules.

===Immediate Window===
While testing a program for correctness (usually called debugging) it is often advantageous to see interim results in a calculation, or to check on values being passed to a subroutine.  Setting breakpoints to stop the program at specific lines can help, as can sending printed values to a second window. VB provides a dockable window for text called the '''Immediate Window'''.  It is available under the View menu or you can press CTRL+G to bring it into view.  It is called the Immediate Window because it can be used to execute BASIC commands immediately.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;VB&quot;&gt;
Print Atn(1) * 4
&lt;/source&gt;

When you type that line into the Immediate Window and press Enter, VB interprets that line as a VB command and executes the command.  In this case it prints the number 3.14159265358979 on the line following the command. (For expediency, the question mark can be substituted for the Print command in most circumstances.) 

You can send text to that same window from a running program using the Print method of the Debug object:

&lt;source lang=&quot;VB&quot;&gt;
Private Sub Text1_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer)
    Debug.Print Chr(KeyAscii), KeyAscii
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case, with a Textbox called Text1 on some form, every letter a user enters into the textbox will be echoed to the Immediate Window, as well as its numerical ASCII value.

Because text is sent to the Immediate Window using the Debug object, many people refer to the Immediate Window as the Debug Window. You may find it listed either way in this literature.   

'''IDE NOTE:'''

It should be noted that running a program using the VB IDE is not ''identical'' to running a stand alone executable program.  The program running inside the IDE is running as a sub-process of the IDE. There are a few small connection and timing issues associated with running as a sub-process.  On the whole, however, a program run in the IDE will look and feel like the finished program, but to fully test a program as the user will see it, it is advisable to create the program executable (.exe) and test that for correctness and usability.

==Parts of a Visual Basic Program==

===Forms===
A form is a window where controls are placed for use by the user of the program. The .Caption property changes the text on the title bar of the window, and the .MinButton and .MaxButton properties show or hide the minimize and maximize buttons. Different window styles such as Dialog boxes, ToolWindows, and standard Forms; as well as some allowed user actions such as resizing and minimizing; are controled by the form's .BorderStyle property. It is a common practice to name a form with ''frm&lt;FormName&gt;'' (ex: frmMain, or frmAlert).

===Components===

A component is an executable module stored either as a .VBX file (Visual Basic eXtension for the 16-bit versions of VB), .OCX (OLE Control eXtension for 32-bit versions) file or as a .DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file.  Components are pre-compiled code modules used by other program writers with/without knowledge and understanding of the details of its inner workings.  Pre-compiled components provide reuseable code that has already been written and debugged.  Components can be code only (.DLL) or have a visual component that can be placed on a form (.VBX and .OCX). VB supplies many commonly used components (Button, Textbox, Listbox, etc.) as controls in the ''Toolbox''.

===Events===

An ''event'' is an activity that occurs during a program's execution usually in response to the user's actions, such as a mouse click or a keypress. An event causes a ''procedure'' to execute. You the programmer can decide what code (if any) you want to place within the different event procedures.

==Controls==

===Control Properties===

To display the Control Properties window, select View\Properties Window or press the F4 key. The Properties window initially appears on the right edge of the main window and contains all the names of the editable properties as well as their current values.  Some control properties are only editable while the program is running, some are only editable while in design mode.

===Buttons===
A button will be your best friend in Visual Basic. Each button should contain code, which is added by you, the programmer. Upon clicking the button, the user will be instructing the program to execute that portion of code. For example, you could set it so when pressed, the program will make a message box that says &quot;HELLO!&quot;. Good programming styles generally use ''cmd&lt;ButtonName&gt;'' when naming a button.

===Text boxes===

Text boxes allows the users to add text areas to their programs.  This text does not have to be typed in directly by the programmer, but could come from other sources such as database fields, text files or data the user will type in while the program is running.
Although the default value for this is the name of the control, it can be set to anything including &quot;&quot; (or nothing). Text box names are prefixed with txt, eg; ''txt&lt;BoxName&gt;''.

===Labels===
Labels are one of the most used Visual Basic objects.
They are often used to label other controls (textboxes, images, etc.) or provide feedback to the user. They are usually named like ''lbl&lt;LabelName&gt;''.

===Timers===

Timers are interesting and easy to learn. If you want the program to perform a certain task after a certain amount of time, the Timer is there to help you out. Their only event procedure is _timer, which will be executed every time after a certain amount of time is passed. The most common steps to use Timers is as simple as follows:&lt;br&gt;
1. Add a timer to the form and give it a name.&lt;br&gt;
2. Set the time interval in the ''Properties'' window to some value above 0.&lt;br&gt;
3. Double click the timer and add the code you want executed at the set intervals.&lt;br&gt;
Timers have very few properties too.&lt;br&gt;
This is a possible use of timer:
(To see it in action add a Command button, Shape control, and Timer to a new form.  Then set the Timer.Interval property using the ''Properties'' window.  Copy the code below into the form's code module and press F5 to run the program.) 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Timer1.Enabled = Not Timer1.Enabled
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
      Shape1.Visible = Not Shape1.Visible
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

This would make the command button stop and start the flashing (repeatedly disappear and reappear) of the Shape control. The flash interval is determined by the Timer's Interval property. '''Timer.Interval''' is measured in milliseconds.

Here is another timer example of a counter: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  '***************************************************************** *
  'APRON TUTORIAL PRESENTED BY MORROWLAND *
  '***************************************************************** *

  '*****************************************************************
  'Timers are the backbone in any good application, you will be able
  'to decide when things will happen in millisecounds by using timers
  'and counters you gain control
  
  'declare counter as integer
  Dim counter As Integer
  
  
  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Timer1.Enabled = False 'disable timer at startup
  End Sub
  
  
  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Timer1.Enabled = True   'starts the timer by enabling it
  End Sub
  
  
  Private Sub Command2_Click()
      Timer1.Enabled = False  'stops the timer by disabling it
  End Sub
  
  
  Private Sub Command3_Click()
      counter = 0             'reset the counter
  End Sub
  
  'The timer procedure
  'the timer procedure will loop in the interval of the timer
  'I have set the timer interval in the &quot;properties&quot; menu to 1000 ms (1 sec)
  Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
  
      counter = counter + 1   'we set the counter to count here
    
      Text1.Text = counter    'write the counter value out as text
    
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;

VB Timers are given low priority on the processing totempole. If any other code needs to execute when the timed interval has elapsed, that other code is allowed to execute before the timer's procedure is called.  Other code can yield some of their processing time to Windows by using the DoEvents command.  That is the only VB command that will allow code you write to yield time to any pending timer events in the program. Without the use of DoEvents, '''each subroutine or function is executed start to finish, in serial fashion.''' In other words, only one command or statement can be executed at a time.  Each subroutine or function must list the proper commands to execute, in their proper order.

===Picture boxes===
Although called picture boxes, these objects are not just a heavyweight version of image boxes: picture boxes almost have the same properties and function as Form objects. It can do far more than just displaying pictures. Probably the best way to describe picture boxes is that they are containers that can group other objects together, kind of similar to frame objects. E.g. several command buttons can be drawn &quot;inside&quot; of it.

See also [[../Simple Graphics/]].

===General properties===
VB extends some common properties to all controls placed on a form.  Name, Top, Left, and Tag, are a few of the extended property names.  When you lasso and highlight several controls on a form, you can change the general property values of all the highlighted controls using the ''Properties'' window.  Making a change there will change the property of the same name for all of the highlighted controls.

===References===
Reference is a kind of link that is used by Visual Basic.  The word reference is used in two distinct ways:

;Component reference: Are typically external libraries such as [[../DLL|DLLs]], [[../OCX|OCXs]], or  [[../typelib|type library]]. Component references are added to the project, so that all parts of the program may interact with the outside component.
;Object reference: Is typically a pointer to an internal [[../objects|object]]. Object references differentiate, or identify, specific objects within the program. The term object is a very general term used to indicate just about anything that has properties to set, or methods to call.  For example, if your form has 5 textboxes on it and you want to put text in just one of them, you need to use the proper 'object reference' to address that specific textbox.

These two uses are quite distinct and generally do not cause any problems.  Usually when ''object reference'' is meant it will be written out in full whereas just ''references'' usually means references to an external library. In both cases, accessing the properties (or methods) of a component or object reference requires a special syntax that includes a period to separate the object and property.  The syntax is:  &lt;object&gt;.&lt;property&gt;  or, by example: Form1.Caption = &quot;This&quot;, or Text1.Text = &quot;That&quot;, etc. where Form1 or Text1 are the specific objects you want to alter, and Caption or Text are the specfic properties being changed. 

You can create [[#Components|components]] in VB to be used by other programs (not just those written in VB).

== Reserved Words==

Visual Basic contains several reserved words. These words are &quot;reserved&quot; because they are specific functions and commands in Visual Basic. For example, a variable may not be named &quot;Print&quot; because it is a feature in VB to print. This can be avoided however, by naming your variables &quot;prnt&quot; or &quot;print1&quot;. As long as it is not the exact word, it should work. A list of frequently used reserved words/keywords:

==REMs==
While programming you may find it necessary to leave yourself notes. This can be used to easily identify areas of code, or as a reminder of sections of code with logic errors that need to be fixed. REMs are very simple. Merely place an apostrophe,  &quot; ' &quot;, or the word, &quot;REM&quot;, before the line and that line will be ignored by the interpreter, whether it be a message to yourself or a section of code. For example:

  ' I leave notes to myself
  REM or I could do it like this
  'If I REM a line of code it will not execute!
  REM x=5

An apostrophe is most often used due to the comparative reduction in space and time as REM has been included so as to be backward compatible with earlier versions of BASIC.  The REM statement is a basic command and must be preceded by a colon if following other commands on the same line.  An apostrophe needs no colon:
 
  x = 5 'This comment will work
  y = 3: REM and this comment will work.
  z = 1 REM This line would cause a syntax error.

==Error Checking==

These are several common types of errors that one might get from a VB program:

;run-time errors: This type of error are errors that are raised when the program is running. Examples: dividing anything by zero or assigning a string to a numeric variable.
;compile errors: Compile errors are errors that the IDE spots at design-time and upon compiling the program just before it runs the program. These errors include syntax errors -- the error raised when the computer does not understand your code, and also errors like undeclared variables etc.
;logic errors: Logic errors are errors that the computer cannot spot. These are errors that, even though the program runs, the result is not what you intended. 

The first two of these errors are generally easy to spot, and the debugging tool can be used to high-light the line of text at which the error occurred.  For example, if you wanted to make a program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, and in the code you used a multiplication symbol instead of division, the program would run fine, but the program would not convert the temperatures correctly, as you desired. Although sometimes these logic errors can be easy to spot, some are quite difficult.  Logic errors become concealed in the lines of code when making complex programs, such as a game. Just remember, the computer does not know what the program is supposed to do, it only knows the code. Look through the code step-by-step and think of how the computer would interpret the code.

VB won't let you just ignore syntax/compile errors. You have to fix them before you can run your program. But run-time errors, which are syntactically correct, but may cause an error if an attempt is made to execute it, can be handled to possibly prevent your program from crashing. The following example shows a very good way of handling a possible error:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Sub Form_Load()
      On Error GoTo ErrorHappened
      i = 1 / 0 'This line will cause an error to be raised as anything divided by zero = infinity
      '...
      'Some code
      Exit Sub 'Here the subroutine is exited if no errors occur
  ErrorHappened:
      'Informs the user an error happened.
      MsgBox &quot;Error Number &quot; &amp; Err.Number &amp; &quot;:&quot; &amp; Err.Description
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The output of this example is a message box that says &quot;Error Number 11: Division by zero&quot;.
The statement ''On Error Goto ErrorHappened'' will skip everything from &lt;tt&gt;i = 1 / 0&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;Exit Sub&lt;/tt&gt; if any run-time error occurs within this procedure. When an error is detected the program will continue to run from right after ''ErrorHappened:'', where the error will be displayed so that the programmer can find out what it is and fix it. This also prevents the program from &quot;crashing&quot;.

''ErrorHappened'' is just a line label, you can name it anything you wish to identify that section of the procedure you want to execute when an error happens. ''On Error Goto'' can only reference line labels that are within the current procedure.  You cannot (easily) define one error handler for all procedures. Exit Sub means to end the Form_Load event immediately.

So if no error occurs, a message box will NOT be called because ''Exit Sub'' will already have ended or exited our subroutine. And if an error does occur, the message box will pop up, displaying the Error Number and the Error Description.

The above example is the safest way of detecting and handling any error that takes place in the subroutine. However you can also choose to ignore errors by using &quot;On Error Resume Next&quot; which means to ignore all errors. Ignoring errors is not a good idea in most scenarios, but in some cases the proper way to handle an error is to do nothing, so they might as well be ignored.  Even using Resume Next, you can test the Err object (Err.Number) to see if an error happened on preceding lines.

See [[../Effective Programming#Errors|Errors]] for more detail about error handling.

==Declaring Variables (Dimensioning)==
If you don't already know, a variable is, by dictionary definition: a symbol (like x or y) that is used in mathematical or logical expressions to represent a variable quantity. In mathematics, common variables are: x, y, z, etc., and they can &quot;hold&quot; values like x=1, y=3, etc. In VB, instead of x, y and z, a variable can have whatever name you want.
It is often good practice, and sometimes necessary, to dimension variables. Often it is called 'dimming'. This process gives the variable its name and the type of value it will be able to hold (which will be discussed later). To dimension a variable, the code is:

  Dim variablename [As Type]

Of course, the variable name could be whatever you want. The type however, is different. You have a choice of single, integer, or string. This tells the computer what type of information the variable holds. &quot;Single&quot; variables can hold numbers with decimal. &quot;Integers&quot; variables can hold whole numbers, while &quot;String&quot; variables holds text or a set of characters. If you don't dim a variable, the type would automatically be &quot;Variant&quot;, which can hold almost all kinds of information. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  Dim intNumber As Integer

  intNumber = 31             ' This is ok
  intNumber = &quot;I didn't&quot;     ' Error: type mismatch (intNumber is an integer while &quot;I didn't&quot; is a string)
&lt;/source&gt;
Dimming is especially important for arrays and matrices. For an array, next to the variable name, you enter the range of the array. For example:

  Dim x(1 to 10) As Integer

Arrays will be covered more in depth later. Matrices are dimensioned almost exactly like arrays are, however, instead of the having only one dimension (1 to 20), matrices may have two: (1 to 20,1 to 5), or even three. Dimensioning can also be used to tell the computer that variables are public. This will be discussed later in the Scope section.

Note: If you don't dimension your variables, you might end up with many unexpected errors. It could be avoided by using the Option Explicit statement, which requires every variable to be defined; if not every variable used in the program is defined, VB raises an error: &quot;Variable is not defined&quot;. To enable this, you just have to type Option Explicit at the very top of ALL your code in the current module. It's a very good practice to do so.

==Simple output==
The interaction between the user and the computer consists of both the input and output of data. The computer will not receive your commands if you don't have a mouse or keyboard which are used to input commands. And conversely, you wouldn't know what the computer is doing at all if there is no monitor or speaker which are used to output data. Therefore output is important.

===Message boxes===
One of the easiest form of output is message box. I'm sure you've seen a lot of message boxes in Windows. This is what the code of a normal message box should look like.
  MsgBox(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
Try it.
Are you tired of the boring &quot;Hello world!&quot;? Let's make a fancier one:
  MsgBox(&quot;Fatal error: Your computer will be shut down in five seconds.&quot;, vbCritical, &quot;System&quot;)
That will creep out quite a lot of people.

===Printing===
Note: The word &quot;printing&quot; here means using the Print statement, it's not about using the printer or printing files.
Printing is a fairly simple part of Visual Basic, but also essential. Printing is used to output information to the user. It proves to be a valuable troubleshooting tool. Whenever printing, you need an object to print on, followed by of course, something to print. Printing may be used with various objects, however, the most common in the picture box. For the sake of simplicity, we are assuming you renamed the picture box as &quot;pic&quot;. In this wikibook though, print is done mainly on picture boxes and forms:
  pic.Print &quot;Hello world!!&quot;   'Prints message on picture box
  Print &quot;Hello world!!!&quot;      'Prints message on current form

===Spacing===
There are various ways to alter how text is spaced when printing. The most common is the comma. A comma will go to the next print zone. Print zones are 15 characters long. You can think of it like pressing the tab key when typing something out. Remember that print zones are fixed, so if you've typed 1 letter, and then used a comma, then it will be a big space. If you type 13 characters and use a comma, it will not be a large space. For example:&lt;br&gt;
  Private Sub Form_Click()
      Me.Print &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Next Zone&quot;
  End Sub
Several new concepts are introduced in this example. The &quot;Form_Click&quot; contains a block of code and it is called to run when the user clicks on the current Form(Form1). 'Me' is the same as the current form (Form1).
Don't be afraid to experiment. No matter what you do in VB, its always reversible. Now, the comma isn't all that versatile. Another feature is tab. Tab will move so many spaces from the BEGINNING of the line. Followed by tab in parentheses is the amount of characters spaces. For example:
  Form1.Print &quot;Hello&quot;; Tab(10); &quot;Yay&quot;
This will NOT print &quot;yay&quot; 10 spaces after the O of &quot;Hello&quot;. Rather it will print 10 spaces from the beginning of the line. You may use as many tabs as you want in the same print command. Although tab is useful, sometimes it is better to space things in relation to what has already been printed. This is where the space function comes in. The syntax of space is identical to that of tab. Space will move the next printed text so many spaces over from its CURRENT location. For example:
  Pic.print &quot;Hello&quot;; Space(10); &quot;Yay&quot;
This will print the first Y of &quot;Yay&quot; 10 spaces to the right of the O in &quot;Hello&quot;. It is important to note, if you write:
  Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
  Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
They will appear on separate lines as:
  Hello
  Hello
This can be easily dealt with in the need of having separate print statements print on the same line. You merely have to change the code to: (note the semicolon)
  Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;;
  Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
This will appear as:
  HelloHello
If you want to make a blank line in between the two &quot;hello&quot;'s, then you may simply have a blank print statement WITHOUT a semicolon. For example:
  Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
  Pic.Print
  Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
This will print as:
  Hello
  
  Hello
It is important to remember that if the first print has a semicolon at the end, often referred to as a trailing semicolon, the empty print will only reverse it, and print the second Hello on the next line, and no blank line will appear.

== Changing chapter name to &quot;Solving quadratic equations&quot; ==

I'm thinking of changing this chapter's name to [[Algebra:Solving quadratic equations]] because basically that's what it's about.  Any feedback on this idea?  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 19:49, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

Perhaps some other algebra topics will be added later, but certainly Solving Quadratic Equations should be a topic.  The first method described should be the graphing one since students all have graphing calculators and are tuned in to them.  I mean you solve ax2 + bx + c = 0 by graphing y = ax2 + bx + c and looking for its x intercepts.

For the factoring method, I would like to do the same example or a more complicated one by the method of listing factors of the first and 3rd terms under the terms and cross multiplying to check.  Many students find this method of organizing the guesses and tests very helpful!  I did the example in a .jpg file but do not have permission to upload it here (I'm a Wikiversity contributor in good standing but not a wikibooks contributor yet - don't really understand why we have some topics in one and others in the other).
[[User:Harveybrown|Harveybrown]] ([[User talk:Harveybrown|talk]]) 02:31, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

== Solutions ==

I think it's very weird that the solutions are directly visible after the example. Maybe its a better idea to but them at the ''bottom'' of the page?
:Solutions following examples are OK, but there should be &quot;homework&quot; type exercises written with the solutions (perhaps) on a separate page.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 17:53, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

== Merge with Algebra:Quadratic functions ==

There seems to be a lot of overlap with Algebra:Quadratic functions.

== Weda ==

I too send this appeal to change the name Weda's theorem to Viete's formulas. Every high school student knows this.

== correction ==
I have a correction. I will ask you to do it, because I am not signed, and such edit will be considered destruction.&lt;br&gt;
OK: it's written:&lt;Br&gt;
the equation has two roots with different signs if &lt;math&gt;\Delta\ge0,\ \frac{c}{a}&lt;0\ \mbox{or}\ ac&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
now, if ac is negative, then (-4ac) will be positive, and the descriminant will be surely positive. therefore, if one needs to find for what values the equation has two roots with different signs, he needs to check when is ac&lt;0, and only this (because for this values the discriminant will be positive for sure). &lt;br&gt;
I hope you understood me. If you didn't, write and i'll try to explain myself more clearly. Yours, from Israel. I am avilable here:
[[he:משתמש:Hbk3]] &lt;br&gt;
if someone saw this, please comment.

== Completing the square ==

Quote:

&lt;math&gt;    \begin{matrix} x^2+8x+9&amp;=&amp;0\\ x^2+8x&amp;=&amp;-9\\ x^2+8x+4^2&amp;=&amp;4^2-9\\ (x+4)^2&amp;=&amp;7\\ &amp;x+4=\sqrt{7}&amp; \quad \mbox{or} \quad x+4=-\sqrt{7}\\ &amp;x=-4+\sqrt{7}&amp; \quad \mbox{or} \quad x=-4-\sqrt{7}\\ &amp;x=-1.35&amp; \quad \mbox{or} \quad x=-6.65 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In general, we get

    &lt;math&gt;x^2+kx+\left({k \over 2}\right)^2=\left(x+{k \over 2}\right)^2 
&lt;/math&gt;
----

How does this '''general''' formula relate to the example ???? Where has the '''-9''' gone to ?? It is at least quite confusing. 

Yes I know that (a + b) x (a + b) = a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2ab + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. I learned that 65 years ago.

:As a way to advance the solution &lt;math&gt;4^2&lt;/math&gt; (your proposed &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;) was added (and the [[w:Complement (mathematics)|complement]] on the other side so it balances as 0, but since it is square the signal is ignored) that is how -9 becomes 7.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:34, 15 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Cioppino''' is a [[cookbook:fish|fish]] [[cookbook:stew|stew]], a descendant of the various regional fish soups and stews of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian cooking]]. It was developed by the fishermen who settled in the North Beach section of San Francisco. Originally it was made on the boats while out at sea and later became a staple as Italian restaurants proliferated in the city. The name comes from the Italian ''ciuppin'', a word which described the local fish stew in the regional dialect of the port city of Genoa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/travel/fare-of-the-country-cioppino-fish-stew-from-the-pacific.html?sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print Info on cioppino from the ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The below recipe is based on one by Giada De Laurentiis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/cioppino-recipe2/index.html Cioppino recipe by Giada De Laurentiis]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Cleaning and eating mussels==
This recipe calls for live mussels. Here are some safety guidelines for buying, eating and cooking live bivalves (mussels and clams):

*Never buy a mussel/clam that's open or cracked.
*Never eat a mussel/clam that won't open after cooking.
*Cook mussels/clams within 24 hours of purchasing.
*Always brush mussels/clams clean before cooking. Remove [[wikipedia:Byssus|beards]] from mussels as well.

For more on this subject have a look at [http://www.foodreference.com/html/clamshappy.html ''Happy as a clam'']
by Chef Mark R. Vogel

==Ingredients==
*3 tablespoons [[cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel bulb]], thinly sliced 
*6 ounces [[cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped 
*8 ounces of [[cookbook:celery|celery]], chopped
*3 large [[Cookbook:shallot|shallots]], chopped 
*2 teaspoons salt 
*4 large [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves, finely chopped 
*3/4 teaspoon dried crushed [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|red pepper]] flakes, plus more to taste 
*6 ounces [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*2 pounds diced [[Cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]] 
*1 1/2 cups dry white [[Cookbook:wine|wine]] 
*5 cups of water 
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*2 pounds [[Cookbook:crab|crabs]], any type, cut into pieces
*2 pounds [[Cookbook:mussel|mussels]], scrubbed, debearded 
*1 pound [[Cookbook:scallop|scallops]]
*1 1/2 pounds [[w:tilapia|tilapia]] cut into two-inch chunks (or substitute any fish with a white, firm flesh)
*2 loaves of [[cookbook:San Francisco Sourdough Bread|San Francisco sourdough bread]] or any other bread with a chewy crust

==Directions==
#Heat the oil in a very large pot over medium heat. 
#Add the fennel, onion, shallots, and salt and sauté until the onion is translucent. 
#Add the garlic and three quarters of a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and sauté for two minutes.
#Stir in the tomato paste.
#Add tomatoes with their juices, wine, water, crabs, celery and bay leaf. Cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
#Add the mussels to the cooking liquid. Cover and cook until the mussels begin to open. This should take about five minutes. 
#Add the scallops and fish. Simmer gently until the fish and scallops are just cooked through and all the mussels are completely open, gently stirring occasionally. This should take about another 10 minutes.
#Check the soup for closed mussels and throw them out. Remove the bay leaf. 
#Season the soup, to taste, with more salt and red pepper flakes.
#It's customary to serve cioppino with San Francisco sourdough bread. However, any bread with a thick, chewy crust will do.

'''Harrisa''' is an extremely spicy chile paste used in North African cooking, mostly in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, although strains can be found in all neighboring countries.

== Ingredients ==
* [[Cookbook:Chile|Chiles]], with stems and seeds removed
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]]

==Procedure ==
The ingredients are blended together to form a smooth paste.

By covering the paste with a little olive oil, it can be stored for several months allowing the sauce to take on a richer flavour, it is not recommended to store in a humid or damp environment.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Mixed with mayonnaise, this paste makes an excellent side dish for chicken and cooked meats, particularly lamb. It can be used sparingly as a marinade or served with yogurt as a sauce.

'''Zuppa alla modenese''' (&quot;soup in the style of Modena&quot;) is an Italian type of soup made with chicken or veal stock, spinach, butter, salt, eggs, Parmesan cheese, nutmeg and croutons.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb (450g) [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* 3 oz (85g) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* grated Parmesan [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Procedure==
# One pound of spinach is washed in five or six waters, then chopped very fine and mixed with three ounces of butter and some salt.
# The mixture is then heat and cooled, passed through a hair sieve (or puréed in a blender or processor) and combined with a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese, two eggs and a small amount of nutmeg, then combined with boiling stock. 
# Sometimes, hot coals are placed on top of the lid to the saucepan so that the eggs will curdle and thicken the soup, which is served with fried croutons.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Soup alla Modanese]] =

I changed the title as the recipe is still known and common today and called &quot;alla modenese&quot; in modern Italian (&quot;modenese&quot; simply means &quot;of (the city of) Modena&quot;).  I couldn't assess whether this &quot;Mod'''a'''nese&quot; is just a misspelling of the referenced book or an ancient version of the adjective; I can't find it on Google, except as a surname.  Anyway, there is no reason to use this erroneous or obsolete spelling here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wet folding is the practice of wetting origami paper with water and folding the model while the paper is wet.  It is a useful method for folding organic forms, since the paper will permamently retain subtle folds and curves after it dries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysian Cuisine]]

A unique dish only found in state of [[w:Johor|Johor]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]] that is very rare nowadays, normally served to the royalties and social elites in Johor at formal functions and celebrations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cockatoo care''' 

* Many [[w:avian veterinarian|avian veterinarian]]s suggest that [[w:parrot|parrot]]s should be fed a pelleted diet, supplemented by fresh food and a small quantity of seeds as snacks. 
* They should have fresh, clean water at all times.
* Their cages should be lined with papers that are replaced regularly.  
* Parrots enjoy regular time outside of their cages interacting with owners, and as they are intelligent, they need plenty of toys to keep them busy. A good rule of thumb is, &quot;A busy bird is a happy bird!&quot;
* When you bring home your first parrot, be sure to find an avian veterinarian -- one who specialises in birds -- to bring your new friend to. It is important to schedule a [[w:well-bird exam|well-bird exam]] to ensure that your cockatoo in good health.
* Any future birds you bring home should spend approximately 45 days in [[w:quarantine|quarantine]] from the bird(s) already in your home. This is to prevent the spread of disease.
* Do not cage incompatible types of birds together. For example [[w:Cockatiel|Cockatiel]]s are so docile that they can easily be hurt by other, more aggressive birds -- even smaller ones, like [[w:budgerigar|budgerigar]]s and [[w:parrotlet|parrotlets]].  
* Many veterinarians recommend that prospective bird-owners seek out a [[w:breeder|breeder]], for breeders' birds are likely to be healthy (as they are not &quot;factory-farmed&quot;) and friendly (as they are typically hand-fed and well-socialized).

==Some warnings==
* Never give a pet parrot [[w:chocolate|chocolate]], [[w:caffeine|caffeinated beverage]]s, [[w:alcohol|alcohol]], [[w:avocado|avocado]], or [[w:rhubarb|rhubarb]].
* Avoid using [[w:PFTE|PFTE]]s (often referred to by the brand name of [[w:Teflon|Teflon]]) around ''all'' pet birds. When PFTEs/ Teflons get very hot, they emit particulates into the air. Birds are more sensitive to particulates than humans are, and they can die suddenly when exposed to PFTE. PFTEs are found in cookware, hair dryers, irons, printers, and more -- check all labels before using electric products near your birds.
* Also avoid using candles, air fresheners, etc. near birds.  Their respiratory systems are much more susceptible to pollutants than those of most mammals.
* Although [[w:cockatiel|cockatiel]]s are capable of reproducing by the time they are a year old, they should be prevented from doing so until they are at least two years old. This is especially important for female cockatiels: Laying eggs requires much calcium, and when a hen lays eggs at too young an age, the egg-laying can interfere with the calcium required by her bones. 
* Birds that lay eggs frequently -- especially cockatiels -- are extremely prone to a dangerous condition known as [[oviduct]] [[prolapse]].
* Do not give parrots gravel for their gizzards.  Unlike softbills, parrots do not need it to digest their food.

I wonder if this page should be renamed &quot;How to care for a pet parrot.&quot; Cockatoos are a type of parrot, and the same recommendations would apply. Perhaps being broader would be better?

*Do we really want this kind of article in Wikipedia? &amp;mdash; [[User:Timwi|Timwi]] 21:21, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Yes we do. There is a lot of information on that page. [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 21:44, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Where is our general discussion on How-to articles? I think we should have one and divide the how-tos into the sort we want and the sort we don't want -- having the nono-howtos then as speedy deletions. [[User:Sverdrup|&amp;mdash; Sverdrup]] [[User talk:Sverdrup|(talk)]] 21:54, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
** Keep. Please look into the page history. It is a logical part of the topic. What it really needs is linking from other places. (and further wikifying) [[User:Mikkalai|Mikkalai]] 22:25, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Needs to be seriously cleaned up.  Wikipedia is not the place for original research.  &quot;All parrots should be fed a diet of primarily pellets&quot; according to whom?  There need to be references added, and POV statements like this need to be attributed and cited. [[User:Anthony DiPierro|Anthony DiPierro]] 23:43, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Delete - advert for the site pretending to be a guide to cockatoos.  - [[User:Texture|Texture]] 23:48, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
***What on earth makes you think that ? have you read the page history? [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 23:54, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**Keep. Could be better, but it's a perfectly good article. Not obviously self-serving or self-promotional. The links should go in an External Links section, and something should be done about the brand names which are OK but only apply to ... what country? Not the U.S. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] 00:50, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)

**Yes, move to wikibooks. [[User:TUF-KAT|Tuf-Kat]] 08:18, Mar 4, 2004 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:Pickerel|Pickerel]] have certain haunts, and though they usually move independent 
of each other, but to catch &quot;a string of pickerel&quot; is a good day's work. Pickerel are fond of shady places, and in summer they frequent the parts of the stream nearly where the pickerel weed grows. They generally spawn in March or April, and earlier in some southern streams. In winter they get under rocks, or stumps, or into convenient deep holes, and they can be taken then with small live fish for bait.

In rivers you can generally catch pickerel near the mouth of some small [[w:stream|stream]] emptying into the [[w:river|river]]; the fall of the year is the best time for catching them. In the hot summer months they will seldom bite at all, except perhaps in a very windy day. In the fall, too, they are in better condition. Pickerel fishing in the spring is sometimes very successful, however, though the fish are not as good when breeding.

At this period their usual beautiful green color and bright yellow spots are dull and leaden. In the more northern waters they are sometimes taken as early as August in good condition.

The tackle used for pickerel is a pretty stiff 10 foot [http://gobassfishing.net/category/fishing-gear-reviews/fishing-rod-reviews/ fishing rod], with a [http://gobassfishing.net/category/fishing-gear-reviews/fishing-reel-reviews/ fishing reel], and some 50 or 60 yards of flax line, which should be protected by the [[w:fishing hook|hook]] with gimp or wire. The Limerick or [[w:Kirby salmon hook|Kirby salmon hook]] is used.
The size is 0 to 5, according to the size of the fish.

In a running stream, the sinker and float will also be found necessary.  The bait should be a small live fish, or [[w:frog|frog]], or the hind leg of a frog skinned. [[w:Worm|Worm]]s are sometimes used in small streams, where the water is clear and the game small. In using live bait, when the pickerel takes it, do not draw your line too quick.

The bait itself, if properly impaled, will be very lively and will be apt to make a violent effort to escape its enemy. Inexperienced [[w:angler|angler]]s may take this movement for a veritable bite; but when the bite comes, there is no mistaking it. In impaling a small fish for bait, pass the hook under the back fin, just under the roots of its rays.

This will not disable the fish, and it will appear lively in the water.
When using live frog bait, you pass the hook through the skin of the back or belly, or the back muscle of the hind legs. The live frog is generally used on the top of the water - if not, you should let him rise occasionally to take the air.

When the pickerel has seized your bait, give him plenty of time to swallow it, and also plenty of line. Sometimes he will hold it in his mouth and play with it before gorging. On bringing him to land, be careful of his jaws, for he has a set of teeth, sharp as needles.

Trolling for pickerel is decidedly an exciting and interesting sport if you have good and large game. A small sail boat, or skiff is used, with an attendant to manage the boat as you direct. You can use the live bait, or an artificial bait, as is most convenient. Some sportsmen are very fortunate with the artificial bait. A stiff rod and reel, with the same tackle as before described, and no sinker — is all that is required. The boat should move gently, and let your line drag far in the rear. With artificial bait the fish is hooked almost instantly. If you use live bait, be exceedingly careful in determining when the fish has gorged it. You should give him several minutes after he has seized it, for this purpose. On seeing the bait, a pickerel will generally run off with it, and will then stop to gorge it, but does not always do so. The sign that he has swallowed it is a peculiar slackening of the line, which experienced anglers can easily understand. But if he has gorged the bait, he will soon start off a second time, and sometimes will stop and start off the third time. In these cases you should never be in a hurry. When you are convinced that he has taken down the bait, draw a tight line, and strike for your fish. If he is large you should play with him until he is quite exhausted, or you may lose him in the attempt to land.

The difficulty of taking a pickerel from the hook may be obviated in a measure by gagging. For this purpose some anglers provide themselves with prepared sticks of various lengths. If the hook is completely swallowed, as is frequently the case, open the stomach in the middle, cut away the hook, and unslipping the knot that holds the gimp, draw it out that way rather than through the mouth. In the [[w:Mississippi River|Mississippi River]] and [[w:Ohio river|Ohio river]] there are several species of this fish, but they all resemble the pickerel of other waters in a greater or less degree. They are of all sizes from half a pound to 20 pounds (0.5 to 9 kg) weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For information on individual plug types please refer to [[w:Domestic AC power plugs and sockets|Domestic AC power plugs and sockets]].  For information on exactly where plug types are used, please refer to the [[w:List of countries with mains power plugs, voltages and frequencies|List of countries with mains power plugs, voltages and frequencies]].

==Plug adapters==
[[Image:Mains plug travel adaptor.jpg|none|right|150px|Adapter]]
These do not convert electricity. They simply allow an appliance (dual-voltage if necessary), a transformer, or a converter from one country to be plugged into the wall outlet of another country. Adapters sometimes do not make an earth connection, and so may be unsafe. For UK and Hong Kong natives and visitors, you can visit page [[w:Common electrical adapters in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom|Common electrical adapters in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom]] for adapters available for you.

==Adapter leads==
These can be made up from appropriate [[w:mains power plug|plugs]] and [[w:extension sockets|extension sockets]] (or [[w:power strip|power strip]]s if more than one socket is required) and cable. This method has the advantage of allowing use of the exact right parts (adapters often attempt to generalise which can lead to loose fitment and easy disloging). Another possibility is to make an adaptor lead with an [[w:IEC connector|IEC male plug]] (with pins as on the cables used to connect power from older PC PSUs to monitors) and an appropriate power strip. This can then be connected to a local [[w:power cord|power cord]] which should be easily obtainable in most countries. If not there is still the option of unscrewing the IEC male plug and screwing on a locally purchased plug.
&lt;!--
search for converters on [[w:Talk:Domestic_AC_power_plugs_%26_sockets]] to find information on why this section was commented

==Converters==
Converters should be used only with &quot;electric&quot; products.
Electric products are simple heating devices or have mechanical motors. Examples are [[w:hair dryer|hair dryer]]s, [[w:Ironing|steam irons]], [[w:toothbrush|toothbrush]]es, or small [[w:Fan (implement)|fans]]. Converters should not be used for more than three hours at a time.
--&gt;

==Transformers==
[[w:Transformer|Transformer]]s are used with &quot;electronic&quot; products. Electronic products have a chip or transistorized circuits. Examples are [[w:radio|radio]]s, [[w:CD|CD]] or cassette players, shavers, [[w:camcorder|camcorder]] battery rechargers, [[w:computer|computer]]s, [[w:computer printer|computer printer]]s, [[w:fax|fax]] machines, [[w:television|television]]s, and [[w:answering machine|answering machine]]s. Transformers can also be used with electric appliances and may be operated continuously for many days. 

Different transformers are available for appliances of different power ratings. Most products have the power printed somewhere on them, although some products list only amps. A rough conversion for the USA and other 110&amp;nbsp;V countries is 1&amp;nbsp;amp equals 100 watts, and for European and other 230&amp;nbsp;V countries 1&amp;nbsp;amp equals 200 watts. The power of the appliance must fall within the range of the converter or transformer being used (allow a margin of at least 10 watts).

Computers are electronic devices and therefore they must be used with a real transformer. It appears that there may be other conversion methods around which may damage electronic equipment. Some [[w:Personal computer|PC]] [[w:power supply unit|power supplies]] have a voltage switch, on the back of the case, for 110&amp;nbsp;V or 220&amp;nbsp;V &amp;mdash; this should never be set incorrectly, and should always be checked if a PC has come from an unknown source or may have been tampered with. Laptop battery chargers, and AC adapters generally have a universal input which can take a wide range of voltages without manual switching. In general, if an appliance has an input that can accept the local voltage, it is generally better to connect it directly (using a plug adapter or adapter lead if needed) than to use transformers or other forms of voltage conversion.

==Earthing (Grounding)==
Anyone who travels much is sooner or later likely to find themselves in a situation where no [[w:ground and neutral|earth]] is available or the earth that is available won't join with any of their plugs or adaptors. Also, just because sockets have earth contacts doesn't necessarily mean they are actually connected to a properly designed and safe earthing system.

For this reason wherever possible [[w:double insulated|double insulated]] equipment is the smart choice for the traveller. Where single insulated equipment is all that is available and the sockets have no earths or dubious earths it is best to at least ensure that the earths of all appliances likely to be touched at the same time are connected together (for example by plugging them into the same powerstrip with earth contacts). This way if one of the cases becomes live they all do and therefore there is minimal voltage between them and therefore touching them at the same time won't give a shock (remember current has to flow between two points on a persons body to give a shock). The worst thing to do in this situation is join the earths in groups which are isolated from each other (for example two powerstrips with earth contacts in two unearthed sockets) as this will spread a fault without providing an equipotential zone throughout the equipment.

It is also a good idea to carry a portable [[w:Residual-current device|Residual-Current Device]] ([[w:Residual-current device|RCD or GFCI]]) which may save a person from electrocution by disconnecting the power very rapidly at a very low leakage current.

==Other considerations==
Radio and television receivers use different bands of frequencies in different parts of the world. For example a North American [[w:NTSC|NTSC]] receiver will not operate in countries using the [[w:PAL|PAL]] television standard or on the different channel assignments for Japanese NTSC television. AM (medium-wave) broadcast stations are on 10 kHz frequency spacing in North America and 9 kHZ in other parts of the world; some digital tuners may have a switch to allow for different spacing of the assigned frequencies. 

Operation of receivers may require a licence or permit or tax to be paid, even if the receiver is technically capable of operating with local standards. Some governments restrict traveller's use of [[w:GPS|GPS]] satellite receivers. 

Personal radio transmitter devices, such as [[w:amateur radio|amateur radio]] equipment, [[w:FRS|FRS]], [[w:GMRS|GMRS]], [[w:MURS|MURS]], or [[w:Citizen's band|Citizen's band]] transmitters may not be permitted in different countries. Frequency assignments dedicated to these services vary by country and an FRS transmitter may interfere with local public safety or business communications. 

Power frequency is 50 Hz in much of the world and 60 Hz in North America and certain other regions. Some motor-operated devices may work at different speeds even if a transformer is used to change the voltage.  For example, very old tape players and record players may not work properly as the pitch of reproduced sound will be off. As a rule of thumb, if the equipment also operates on internal batteries, it will not be sensitive to power system frequency.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Electrical travellers' guide]] =
Strictly speaking, titled like this, this article should be about what Electrical traveller's guides are, instead of being one (plus there's a typo in the title). Furthermore, it is not exactly a ensyclopedia article, but more like a [[HOWTO]]-manual. Maybe it would be better placed in [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikibooks]]? [[User:Timo Honkasalo|Timo Honkasalo]] 18:59, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:&quot;Domestic AC power plugs &amp; sockets&quot; used to have this content in its travellers guide section (which made sense there imo) unfortuntely that page hit over 32K (again) and i thought this section was the one which could be most logically seperated out. 
:i agree that this taken in isolation isn't very ensyclopedic but i also feel it is an iportant part of our info on &quot;Domestic AC power plugs &amp; sockets&quot; and unfortunately keeping it in that article was probablamatic because of size issues 
:BTW how did you come accross this article? [[User:Plugwash|Plugwash]] 01:41, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I suggest this page be moved to wikitravel, where it seems more appropriate than here. This article is a traveller's guide, rather than being about an Electrical traveller's guide. -- [[User:Joolz|Joolz]] 17:54, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:yeah but to do that you would have to get agreement to relicense from all contributers. (wikitravel is CC-BY-SA not GFDL) [[User:Plugwash|Plugwash]] 19:12, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Move to Wikibooks ==

I suggest moving it to Howtos on wikibooks. I would do it already, but I don't have admin privileges and have no idea how to move it to another wiki. --[[User:Dcabrilo|Dejan Cabrilo]] 20:13, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Potstickers''' (&amp;#38149;&amp;#36148; &amp;#37707;&amp;#36028; gu&amp;#333;ti&amp;#275;; literally &quot;pot stick&quot;) are a Northern Chinese style [[Cookbook:Dumpling|dumpling]] popular as a street food, appetizer, or side order in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese cuisine]]. This dish is often served on a [[Cookbook:Dim sum|dim sum]] menu, but may be offered independently. The filling for this dish usually contains [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] (or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]), [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallion]]s, [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], and [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame seed]] oil. The mixed filling is sealed into a dumpling wrapper, steamed in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]], and then fried to crispness on one side in a shallow frying pan. The effect of the one crisp side of the dumpling is where it gets its English name of '''potsticker''' as it appears to have been stuck to the pot in which it was cooked. The potsticker is similar to the Japanese [[Cookbook:Gyoza|gyoza]] dumpling.

Also see recipes for [[Cookbook:Gyoza]] and [[Cookbook:Pot Stickers]] (which has a nice pictorial).

Yield: About 24 Potstickers

== Ingredients ==
* 1 package gyoza or wonton wrappers

=== Filling ===
* 1/2 pound (about 250 g) ground chicken or pork
* 1/2 pound ground prawn or raw shrimp
* 12 raw prawns (shrimp), chopped
* 1/2 cup water chestnuts, fresh if possible, peeled and sliced
* 1 Tablespoon light soy sauce or Kikkoman
* 1 Tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 Tablespoon salt
* Pinch of white pepper if desired
* 3 Tablespoons green/spring onion, minced
* 3 Tablespoons ginger, minced
* 3 Tablespoons cilantro, chopped

== Procedure ==
# Mix together the filling ingredients.
# Place a small bowl of water on the work area.  
# Lay out one of the gyoza wrappers in front of you.
# Dip your finger in the water and moisten the edges of the wrapper.
# Place a heaped teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.
# Fold the gyoza wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to seal it shut.
# (You may want to use a cornstarch/water mixture to make this easier).
# Heat 2 Tablespoons oil in a large skillet or wok.  
# When oil is ready, carefully add the dumplings and cook on high heat until golden brown (about 1 minute).
# Without turning the dumplings over, add 1 cup of water and cover.  
# Steam for about 1 minute to cook the raw filling and then turn off the heat (this is to keep the bottom from burning).  
# Let the dumplings cook for a few more minutes with the heat turned off.  

Serve the potstickers with Dipping Sauce or soy sauce.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fiction technique''' is a set of rules for writers who want to write quality fiction for novels, novellas, or short stories. They were developed through trial and error by fiction writers throughout history, including authors from [[World History/Ancient Greece and Alexander the Great|ancient Greece]]. Some rules are rigid, whereas others are flexible. It is the astute writer who endeavors to master fiction writing that will know which rules to adhere and which to break. 


''This is a work in progress and is a HOW TO manual on developing good fiction writing skills. It should not contain content for &quot;How to get an agent&quot;, &quot;How to submit a manuscript&quot;, &quot;How to get out of the slushpile&quot;, &quot;Negotiating contracts&quot;, &quot;Dealing with rejection&quot;, or English grammar advice. Those don't describe how to write good fiction. The following is a suggested outline of the planned article structure. This comment should be removed once the sections are fleshed out.''


==The 3 Acts==
:The Greek play:
:Beginning, Middle, End

==Character Development==
#Characters are what they do on the page
#Justifying the behavior of characters  (show their fears, hopes, loves, hates, motivations and how these lead to action)
#What readers need to know about a character -- less than writers think!
#Multidimensionality -- fleshing out cardboard cutouts
##What do they hate?
##What is their favorite color?
##Are they obsessive about something, and if so what?
##What are their favorite expressions and exclamations?
##What are they afraid of?
#There is no need for gushing physical descriptions!

==Plot Development==
:Conflict and turmoil
:The opening scene: getting to the conflict quickly
:Showing versus telling
:Narrative and exposition
:Weaving back story
:Plants and how to use them unobstrusively
:The basic plots (there are fewer than 25 original plots)
:Which comes first? The character or the plot.
:Secondary plots

==Climax and Plot Conclusion==
:The reader expects closure: satisfying the reader or playing on their expectations
:The rise and climax of conflict
:When to quit

==Setting and Scene==
:Where, when, who
:Scene as the driver of plot
:Beats
:How to arrange and order scenes
:Keeping the story moving and keeping the reader interested
::Alternation of fast action and slow action
:What scenes are needed, which are useless

==Point of View==
: Is it First Person? Third? Be clear on how you set this up and keep it consistent, unless as a clear and distinct device (e.g. Game of Thrones).

==Dialogue==
:Showing through dialogue
:Revealing back story through dialogue (and making it sound natural)
:Revealing character through dialogue
:Dialogue Mechanics-- attributions and tags
:Interior monologue

==Self Editing==
:Less is more and eliminating redundancy and useless words
:Eliminating errors and rooting out plot mistakes
:The overuse of adverbs (the -ly kind) to substitute for weak prose
:Speaker attributions
::_____, he said. Not ____, said he.
::Limiting descriptions on attributions _____, he groaned. ______, she cried. _____, they beckoned. etc.
::Adverbs and attributions
:Paragraphing
:The cliché and hackneyed
:[[/Deus Ex Machina/]]

==Mastering Fiction==
:Getting organized
::Writing an outline or synopsis
::Using index cards
::Research: locale, history, people, customs, etc
:Writing as habit
:Ideas
:Allusion
:Metaphor
:Theme
:Prose as art
::Rhythm, word selection, sentence and paragraph length, variation
:Reading (and imitating) the works of the great authors

==Writer's Block==
:Techniques to break through
# Write down anything that comes to mind.  Try to draw ideas from what has been written.
# Take a break from writing.
# Read other peoples' writing to get ideas.
# Ask others if they have any ideas.
# Write with the screen off, it limits your inclination to edit as you write.
# Don't be afraid of writing awkwardly.  Write it down, and edit it later.
# Set deadlines and keep them.
# Work on multiple projects at a time
# Avoid sitting for hours on end staring at a blank page. Go out and do something different, then come back when you have more ideas.
# If you are jammed where you are, stop and write somewhere else, where it is comfortable.

It stands on its own, and applies to other lengths of writing.

Josh English


I agree - they are independent of each other in thought and content, and should remain separate.

Aggi


Definitely keep it separate. As others have said, it does not only apply to novels.

Mike

Don't merge. These techniques could apply to any genre, not just novels. Anything from screenplays to short stories to novellas. OTOH, it does need editing. While three acts is one way to approach fiction, it's certainly NOT the only way.[[User:Ddpattison|Ddpattison]] ([[User talk:Ddpattison|talk]]) 02:11, 30 March 2009 (UTC)


I added Vonnegut to the list. I feel that he's significant enough to mention, admirably. [[User:Chaseeversole|Chaseeversole]]</text>

{{vegetable}} | [[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]]

Potatoes come in a vast number of varieties. This page lists some of the most popular.

== Britain and Ireland ==
=== Charlotte ===
A small reddish potato, normally used as a new potato, served boiled.
=== Fortyfold ===
A small red-skinned maincrop potato, with a creamy texture, best used baked or roast.
=== King Edwards ===
A large, all purpose potato. Normally used as an old potato, and traditionally served roast as part of a formal Sunday dinner (with [[Cookbook:Roast Beef|roast beef]]).
===Maris Piper===
A white potato, which can be harvested new or, more usually, as an old potato, when it is widely regarded as among the best potatoes for making into chips.
===Picasso===
A large to very large maincrop potato with a reddish skin and a smooth texture. Good roast.
=== Pink fir apple ===
A long, thin potato with a knobbly, pinkish skin. Normally boiled in its skin and allowed to cool for use in a salad.
=== Shetland Black ===
A variety first introduced in the 1920s. The skin is dark purple, rather than black, and the flesh is creamy with a nutty flavour. Best roast or baked, but can be boiled in its skin for an attractive visual appearance and contrast in texture.

==Welcome==

Welcome to your first Hungarian lesson! Please post any questions on the discussion page.  First we're going to learn how to read Hungarian (and all of its funny characters!) and then we're going to practice reading words.  Finally, we will introduce a very important concept in the Hungarian language: vowel harmony.

By the end of this lesson you will learn that Budapest is really pronounced as &quot;Budhaphesht&quot; (rough approximation).

{{Audio|Hu-Budapest.ogg|listen}}

==Sounds part 1==

===Intro===
The following letters and combinations of letters are considered to be a single sound each by the speakers of the Hungarian language. '''Compound letters''' aren't hard to pronounce after you have learnt the pronounciation of single letters, since most of them (with the exception of &quot;ly&quot;) sound like the two (or three) sounds pronounced quickly after each other.

Vowels with the [[w:Acute accent|acute accent]] are &quot;long&quot;, and are generally held 1.5 to 2 times as long as their unaccented counterparts.

Consonants can be made long by doubling them: étterem (restaurant), szálloda (hotel). Consonants that consist of multiple letters (&quot;gy&quot;, &quot;ly&quot;, etc.) double their first letter (&quot;ggy&quot;, &quot;lly&quot;, etc.).  Don't exaggerate the long sounds. As a reference think of English phrases like &quot;long gun&quot; or &quot;clown nose&quot; where the common letter simulates a long consonant.

===The letters and sounds of Hungarian===
You may want a printed copy of this chart.  '''Always be mindful of the difference between sz and s'''. It is very easy to accidentally revert to English and learn words with the wrong pronunciation.

The letter '''y''' is called '''ipszilon'''. &lt;br&gt;
The letter '''ly''' is called '''elipszilon'''. &lt;br&gt;
The letter '''w''' is called '''duplavé''' or '''vevé'''. &lt;br&gt;
All the other letters are called as they are pronounced. &lt;br&gt;



Note the differences: &lt;br&gt;
''s''ó  {{Audio|Hu-só.ogg|listen}} = salt but ''sz''ó  {{Audio|Hu-szó.ogg|listen}} = word&lt;br&gt;
fog''a''s {{Audio|Hu-fogas.ogg|listen}} = rack but fog''á''s {{Audio|Hu-fogás.ogg|listen}} = course, dish&lt;br&gt;
That is why it is so important not to confuse letters with English counterparts, or with other letters.

===Alphabetical order===
For alphabetic ordering, the consonant digraphs (2-letter consonants) and the vowels with umlauts are considered to be separate letters:
*''cukor'' before ''csak''
*''ott'' before ''öccse''
*''utca'' before ''üdítő''

However, the long and short vowels are treated together:
*''új'' before ''ujj''
*''éhes'' before ''ehhez''
*''ebéd'' before ''édes''

If nothing else differs between the words, the short vowel is before the long vowel:
*''öt'' before ''őt''

==Grammar /functions==
===Addressing someone===
Before you begin learning some words, it is good to know that Hungarian—unlike English, but like German or Spanish—tends to have two different forms of address, which basically means that they can use two words for the same person, i.e. you can say &quot;te&quot; but you can also say &quot;ön&quot; or &quot;maga,&quot; the latter two being more polite. Most of the time children address adults with the latter form (they used to do it with their parents too, but not anymore), and also two adults address each other with that form, if they don't know each other. So the other form (&quot;te&quot;) is used when talking to people you know well, and usually siblings too, etc. It's called &quot;tegezés,&quot; and the other form &quot;magázás.&quot; &quot;Magázás&quot; can also express honour and adoration to someone. (There are other forms of polite address as well such as &quot;ön&quot; and &quot;kend,&quot; the latter used mostly by country folk and rapidly becoming obsolete.) 

Also, if you get to know somebody, whoever is older can offer to use &quot;tegeződés,&quot; and instead of addressing each other with &quot;ön&quot; or &quot;maga.&quot; you can use &quot;te.&quot; But make sure that it is acceptable to the other party before this happens as &quot;letegezés&quot; (addressing him with &quot;te&quot;) could be taken as offensive.

Polite forms are very important in Hungarian and addressing someone with the inappropriate level of politeness can cause complications. This includes addressing someone who is a close friend with a polite form such as &quot;maga&quot; instead of the familiar form. Doing this usually signifies displeasure.

===Greeting and saying goodbye===
Now that we have some idea how to read Hungarian, let's practice by learning basic words!

Good morning - '''Jó reggelt (kívánok)''' {{Audio|Hu-jó reggelt kívánok.ogg|listen}} (until 8-9AM)

The entire phrase literally means &quot;I wish you a good morning,&quot; and it is more polite to say &quot;kívánok&quot; than leave it out, which is akin to slang. For example, one would not leave out &quot;kívánok&quot; when addressing an old lady. This applies to all other greetings using &quot;kívánok.&quot;

Good day - '''Jó napot (kívánok)''' {{Audio|Hu-jó napot kívánok.ogg|listen}} (from 8-9 AM to 5-6 PM) (until it gets dark)

Good evening - '''Jó estét (kívánok)''' {{Audio|Hu-jó estét kívánok.ogg|listen}} (after 6 PM)

Good night - '''Jó éjszakát (kívánok)''' {{Audio|Hu-jó éjszakát kívánok.ogg|listen}} (if you go to bed)

Note that Hungarians do not say &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; but simply Good day, as above: '''Jó napot (kívánok)'''

In addition, there are separate greetings depending on the person.


'''Csókolom''' ({{Audio|csokolom.ogg|listen}}), which literally means &quot;I kiss (it)&quot; (Hungarians used to kiss ladies' hands when they met, and this &quot;Csókolom&quot; is a shorter form of &quot;Kezét/kezit csókolom&quot; = &quot;I kiss your hand&quot;), is used by children to adults (traditionally to their parents, but nowadays most parents do not mind if their children use &quot;te&quot; for them), and by men to women. This is the greeting to use when speaking to a 80-year-old grandmother. Sometimes it is unclear whether or not to use this greeting, or awkward, and so &quot;Jó napot kívánok&quot; can be used instead. '''Csókolom''', like most Hungarian greetings, means both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye.&quot;

'''Viszontlátásra''' {{Audio|Hu-viszontlátásra.ogg|listen}} is used as a formal farewell, and literally means &quot;for seeing again,&quot; the same as the German &quot;Auf Wiedersehen.&quot; This is the only word that exclusively means &quot;goodbye.&quot; Say this when leaving a shop, airplane, etc. It can be shortened to '''viszlát''' or '''viszlátásra''', but these are considered slang, more informal, and should not be used with older people, though they may be used with younger people. (Though for some people '''viszlát''' is too formal. )

'''Szia''' is a frequently used greeting that means both &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;bye,&quot; depending on the context. It is informal, so do not use it when speaking to an elderly person (unless part of your family) or someone you do not know. Similarly, the word '''helló''' is often used by younger people. Though, like &quot;szia,&quot; it is sometimes used to mean both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye,&quot; the most common use of the two words are (confusingly) '''szia''' for hello, and '''helló''' for goodbye.

'''Szervusz''' and '''Szevasz''' are other informal, slightly old-fashioned greetings to express &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye.&quot;

'''Sziasztok''', '''Szervusztok''' and '''Szevasztok''' are the plural forms of these greetings, which can be used, if we meet two or more people.

'''Cultural note:'''

Hungarian close friends and relatives greet each other by kiss on each cheek provided that at least one of them is a woman. Hungarian males greet each other with a handshake, which should be done like this: you stay one step distant from each other, elbows slightly bent and you give a firm, but not too strong handgrab. You do not actually shake it, just grab. The grab does not take longer the one or two seconds. 

Tip: It is very impolite not to accept one's hand, but there is a way to avoid it, if you do not feel like shaking hands (e.g. it is a hot summer day and one's palm may be sweaty): You keep two or more meters distance. If the partner still wants to shake hands you can say sentences like: ''Elnézést, most mostam kezet!'' (I am sorry, I have just washed my hands - meaning that they are probably wet.), or ''Elnézést, kicsit piszkos a kezem, épp autót szereltem.'' (I am sorry, my hands are dirty for I have just repaired my car.) Be prepared, that the answer still sounds: ''Nem baj.'' (Never mind that.) And soon you find yourself shaking hands.

Just a remark in connection with this is that Hungarians shake hands more often than people from Northern Europe, especially Englishmen. You shake hands with a Hungarian friend, partner or relative when you meet, when you depart and when you meet again, on the same day. 

The distance during an interaction is also a bit closer than is normal in north Europe. Communication distance with friends is one and a half or two steps, with business partners a maximum of two meters.

If you come for an informal visit to Hungary, be prepared for backslaps, handshakes, hugs, and other kinds of physical contact from your friends.

===Thanking===

'''Köszönöm''', which means &quot;thank you&quot;, will always come in handy. The equivalent of &quot;thank you very much&quot; is '''köszönöm szépen''', which is literally &quot;I thank nicely&quot;. This word can be used with any age, but its shortened versions, '''köszi''', and '''köszi szépen''', are informal and should not be used with older people.

The response is '''szívesen''', which literally means &quot;gladly&quot; and is the equivalent of &quot;you're welcome&quot;. &quot;You're very welcome&quot; is '''nagyon szívesen'''.

===Excusing, apologising===

'''Elnézést kérek''', '''Elnézését kérem''' or simply '''Elnézést''' (all of these means &quot;I beg your pardon&quot;,&quot;Sorry.&quot;), '''Bocsásson meg''' (&quot;Excuse me!&quot;), '''Bocsánat''' (&quot;Pardon&quot; or &quot;Excuse me!&quot;)  or '''Ne haragudj!''' (literally &quot;Don't be cross with me&quot;, but used as the equivalent of &quot;Sorry!&quot;) are the formal forms of apologising, usually naming the reason of the apology afterwards e.g. &quot;Elnézést kérek, de most el kell mennem.&quot; (&quot;I beg your pardon but now I have to leave.&quot;). The informal form of apologising is '''bocs''', '''bocsi''' or '''bocsesz''', appparently derived from &quot;bocsánat&quot;.


The response is '''Semmi gond/probléma''', '''Nem gond/probléma''' (both &quot;No problem&quot;), '''Nem számít''' (&quot;Doesn't matter) or '''Nyugodtan''' (&quot;As you please&quot;).

===Tessék - a multi-purpose word===
The word '''Tessék''' is frequently used. Depending on the context, it can take different meanings. It is often used when handing something to someone else, offering a seat, or placing food on another's plate, for example. In this usage, it translates as &quot;Here you go.&quot; It can also mean &quot;For you,&quot; and also &quot;Go ahead,&quot; and when answering the phone, it means &quot;Yes?&quot; or &quot;Pardon?&quot; (asking back).  It is also used informally as &quot;excuse me, can you repeat that&quot; if formed as a question.

==Sounds part 2==
===Vowel harmony===
Vowel harmony is a critical concept in Hungarian. Words are sorted into two categories: [[w:Back vowel|back vowel]] and [[w:Front vowel|front vowel]], corresponding to the area of the mouth responsible for creating each sound. Front vowels are further subdivided to rounded and unrounded categories, based on mouth shape. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 |'''Back vowels''' || a, á, o, ó, u, ú
 |-
 |'''Front rounded vowels''' || ö, ő, ü, ű
 |-
 |'''Front unrounded vowels''' || e, é, i, í
 |-
 |}

A helpful tip for memorizing vowel harmony is that all the back vowels are used in the word &quot;auto&quot; (minus the accented long vowels, of course).

'''Why is it so important to remember this?'''

It is needed when you attach suffixes to words. Hungarian is an agglutinative language, which means that many things are expressed using suffixes. These suffixes can have one, two or three forms, and you have to choose based on the rule called vowel harmony.
One-form suffixes are good things, as they are the same for all words. Unfortunately, they are rare. A more representative example is the pair of suffixes -ban/-ben, corresponding to the English preposition &quot;in&quot;. Here, the vowels of a word determine which one of the pair we use: if a word has only front vowels (front word, like ''kert''), the ending will be the one with front vowels (''kertben''). If the word has only back vowels (back word, like ''ház''), we use the back vowel ending (''házban''). Quite simple.

'''But what if there are both kind of vowels in one word (''mixed word'')?'''
Then the last vowel is examined. If it is a back vowel or a front rounded vowel, then it wins, and the whole word is taken to be like the last vowel. For example ''parfüm'' has the front rounded vowel ''ü'' as last, so it becomes ''parfümben'', ''terror'' has the back vowel ''o'' as last, so it becomes ''terrorban''.

If the last is a front unrounded vowel (''e'', ''é'', ''i'' or ''í''), then things become more intricate. In most cases these front unrounded vowels are transparent in mixed words. This makes ''taxi'' become ''taxiban'' since the ''i'' is transparent and ''a'' is back. But with ''martini'', both ''martiniban'' (based on the ''a'') and ''martiniben'' (based on the ''i'') are correct, since the two i's together are not so transparent anymore so they may or may not win.

As said before, some suffixes have three forms like -hoz/-hez/-höz (meaning the English preposition &quot;to&quot;). Here, we have separate endings for back (-hoz), front unrounded (-hez), and front rounded vowels (-höz).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 | house || ''ház'' || to the house || ''a házhoz''
 |-
 | child || ''gyerek'' || to the child || ''a gyerekhez''
 |-
 | you || ''ön'' || to you || ''önhöz'' 
 |}

'''Stress''': Unlike in English, in Hungarian the stress is always on the first syllable of a word.
'''Syllables''': Vowels are syllable makers even if they stand alone, and they are pronounced separately, not as a diphthong: ká-vé, te-a, fi-ú-nak.

==Subject pronouns==
Unlike English, Hungarian has a formal &quot;you&quot; and informal &quot;you&quot;. The informal you (te) is used for friends, people your age or younger, and children. The formal you (ön, maga) is used for people older than you and people you do not know. 

The subject personal pronouns in Hungarian are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''én'''
| I 
|'''mi'''
| we 
|-
| '''te''' 
| you (singular, informal)
| '''ti''' 
| you (plural, informal)
|-
| '''maga''', '''ön'''
| you (singular, formal)
| '''maguk''', '''önök'''
| you (plural, formal)
|-
|'''ő''' 
| he/she 
| '''ők''' 
| they
|}

'''Cultural note:'''

The two formal forms, ''ön'' and ''maga'', originate from the custom that was in practice until around 1945, namely that family members called each other ''maga'' (even wife and husband or children, except these latter were little children) and strangers should have been addressed with ''ön''. Only close friends of the same sex and social class, lovers and children between themselves addressed each other with ''te''. Nowadays this custom is not in practice anymore, and it is quite a general phenomenon to address even strangers with ''te'' form, except you want to show respect (e.g. with older people). In this case ''ön'' is preferred, for some people consider ''maga'' as impolite, which it is not, but until you get to know the Hungarian culture a bit closer, it is &quot;safer&quot; to use ''ön''.

== Names ==

Names are written (and said) in the reverse order as in English. The surname ('''vezetéknév''') comes first and then the givenname ('''keresztnév'''). Hungarian names are reversed when used in an English context. English names aren't reversed when used in Hungarian context. A lot of Hungarian names have English equivalent. (These names came mostly from western influence in the middle ages.) 


Widespread Hungarian surnames: Kovács (Smith),  Szabó,  Szűcs,  Varga,  Takács.
Names that don't have English equivalents: Levente, Piroska.

Few examples: Kovács László, Szabó István, Takács Anna

== Word order ==
In Hungarian there's no fixed word order like in English or German. Words can be arranged in almost every possible order, but the emphasis (so the intention of the sentence) will differ. (The emphasis is usually at the beginning of a sentence, but it's not always trivial for non-native speakers to decide where the emphasis is. For native speakers, different word orders have different meanings.) Adjectives and nouns, and other compound expressions, of course, cannot be separated.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 | '''feláll''' || stand up
 |-
 | '''szék''' || chair
 |-
 | '''én''' || I
 |-
 | '''-ra/-re''' || on
 |}


'''Felálltam''' a székre. = I stood up on the chair. &lt;br&gt;
'''A székre''' &lt;u&gt;'''én'''&lt;/u&gt; álltam fel. - ( There's strong emphasis on &quot;én&quot; and there's a weak one on &quot;A székre&quot;. Usually &quot;én&quot; and other personal pronouns are omitted. We only put it, if it's important to emphasize. ) &lt;br&gt;
'''A székre''' álltam fel. &lt;br&gt;
'''Felálltam''' én a székre. 

As a rule of thumb, we can say that usually the emphasis is on the beginning of the sentence.

In a long sentence the verb or the subject almost never occurs at the end of the sentence. It's therefore hard to translate synchronously from a language such as German to Hungarian, because in German the verb follows the subordinate clauses.

For the 1st demonstration, [[w:safety goggles]] and/or screen(s) are appropriate to protect against aluminum shrapnel or other risks. For the 2nd, be careful that the setup is not near any strong heat sources or objects that could be easily upset as the paper could go flying.

[[Image:Science_air_pressure_demo_with_soda_can_and_bunsen_burner.JPG]]

Briskly boil a small amount of water for a short time in a soft drink can (until it is full of steam) Then, using a pair of tongs (or clamp if your tongs are too small), swiftly invert the can and plunge it into a large beaker (bowl or bucket) of cold water. The steam [[w:condensation|condenses]], the pressure inside the can falls, and the can collapses (is crushed by the higher atmospheric pressure weighing on the outside of the can).  The can must seal on the bottom of the dish with the water, otherwise the vacuum created in the can will only draw water up into the can, and the can will not collapse.

== Force divided by area ==
[[Image:Science_air_pressure_demo_with_meter_stick.jpg]]

Place a full double page sheet (preferably from a broadsheet newspaper) over a ruler or long stick placed on the edge of a desk. The ruler should be protruding out over the edge. Get predictions from the class on the outcome, and then hit the end of the ruler sharply. If done well the page will stay put, or rip. The [[w:atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] pressing down on the newspaper holds the newspaper down despite the [[w:force|force]] of the ruler trying to push it up.Really you not need the air pressure to explain it, the air pressure can be the same above and below the paper.
To show that is not the air pressure you can use two more rulers at both sides of the protruding ruler. Now the air pressure is the same above and below the paper, and the ruler broke again. It is the mass of the paper that broke the ruler. Using a small piece of plasticine on the ruler with the same mass as the paper, you may the ruler again

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a '''School Science Experiment for demonstrating the properties of waves on an Oscilloscope'''. The following standard demonstration is used in many schools and colleges to show the basic principles of waves. 

[[Image:Sound waves from a SG on a 'scope.png|frame|none|&lt;center&gt;''Demonstration equipment''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Oscillator, oscilloscope, and loudspeaker.''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Setting Up==
A [[w:signal generator|signal generator]] is connected to an [[w:oscilloscope|oscilloscope]] and a [[w:loudspeaker|loudspeaker]]. Some signal generators have two outputs:
*one marked with a low value [[w:impedance]] e.g. 8 &amp;Omega;
*the other marked with a high value e.g 600 &amp;Omega;.
In this case the high impedance output goes to the oscilloscope, the low to the speaker. 
If there is only one output connection, stackable 4mm plugs are used to connect both devices to the signal generator.

The oscilloscope is adjusted so that there is a clear sine wave trace that occupies about half the screen height and has two or three clear waves visible when the signal generator is set at a medium frequency and mid volume.

==Demonstrating the Amplitude and Frequency==

[[Image:Waves on an oscillascope.png|float|none|''Amplitude and Frequency'']]

The advantage of setting the demonstration up in this manner, over the more traditional method of plugging a [[w:microphone]] into the input of the scope, is that the signal generator produces perfect [[w:sine]] waves, which keeps everything nice and straightforward.

*By changing the [[w:frequency]] of the signal generator, the effect can be seen as more complete waves on the screen correspond to a higher [[w:pitch (music)|pitch]] of the sound.
*By changing the [[w:amplitude]] (volume) of the signal generator, the amplitude of the waveform on the scope can be seen to change and the loudness of the speaker sound changes.

==Stuff to update==
===Audio===
Can anyone add audio to lesson one?  It would be awesome to download pronunciations so new students could study them.  It just takes a second and a cheap microphone that you probably have lying around =).  I'd do it, but my Hungarian isn't good enough for an ideal pronunciation. [[User:ErikG|ErikG]] 19:26, 18 August 2005 (UTC)


I can and have made audio files, but apparently .wav is not an acceptable file format. They're at hpmaniacs.com/Other/audio, in case you're interested. [[User:Emiellaiendiay|Emiellaiendiay]] 05:44, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

==Stuff to add==
===Exercise===
We should create exercises for Lesson 1
===Present tense===
Duh!  This is needed, and we could roll that into basic endings like the accusative [[User:ErikG|ErikG]] 19:26, 18 August 2005 (UTC)


==Join forces==

I (FerKo) am trying to help, first attempt to add on audio of Hungarian sounds, others may follow. I am more inclined to follow a differnt path in the arrangement of the curriculum. We could discuss it when I am not at work. Cheers
[[User:155.192.0.234|155.192.0.234]] 10:05, 8 September 2005 (UTC) see
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hungarian:Lesson_1

==Overall plan==
Hi, I'm interested in this project. I'm not a native speaker, but I am a language teacher and learner. I started thinking about the order in which I think Hungarian should be taught. I'm writing that into an overall plan, including the things I wish someone had told me early on! It'll probably take me another 2 or 3 weeks - I'll publish it here on the talk page for comment when I've finished. [[User:Gailtb|Gailtb]] 22:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)


==My overall plan is ready==

===Rationale===
Don't be daunted by the size of this! I don't have any expectation that more than the first few lessons will ever be written, but I wanted to make sure that things were in a logical order. It also ended up as a personal revision session - I had no idea I knew so much!

The following principles were important in the planning:
#Grammar is ordered using the criteria of simplicity and usefulness. Of course these sometimes conflict, so this is just what I think will work.
#Thorough practice is needed in the sound system. (Note, there is often no direct link between the grammar and the sounds in any lesson.)
#Suffixes are introduced slowly to give a chance for them to be practised and start to become automatic

===Suggested lesson structure===
I've taken ideas from other language books such as [[Chinese (Mandarin)]] to give the following:
#Dialogue /text - shows the language in context
#Grammar /functions
#Vocabulary
#Sounds
#Exercises

Although I mostly haven't filled in the columns for vocab and exercises, these are essential. Vocab without grammar can make for successful communication. Grammar without vocab cannot.

In order to be a textbook rather than just information in an encyclopedia entry, it's important to include examples and practice in each lesson. For example, lesson one could have example 2-line dialogues of exchanging greetings, etc.

===Reorganisation===
There was lots of stuff on the welcome page which was or should have been in lesson one, so I've moved /removed it.

I've also changed lesson one to fit my suggested structure, and made some changes for linguistic accuracy (eg vowel harmony is most definitely ''not'' grammar, nor is it unique to Hungarian).

===My grammar questions - can anyone help?===
1) I know the following suffixes use the oblique stem:
*accusative, eg levelet, falvat, tavat
*plural, eg levelek, falvak, tavak
*1st sing possessive, eg levelem, falvam, tavam
*2nd sing possessive, eg leveled, falvad, tavad
*3rd singular possessive, eg levele, falva, tava

Is it used for any other suffixes, eg -n for 'on'?

== It depends on the noun type. You can use the same oblique, as you put it, stem to produce plural (levelek, kezek).

2) Does the object have to be singular for -lak/-lek or can it be plural?
== No, you can say 'ismerlek titeket'.

3) I think there's a difference between English and Hungarian something like a singular noun is used when plural possessors each have one of something (eg 'a féjünk' = 'our heads'). Is this correct? Does it only apply to parts of the body or does it apply to anything, eg 'a tollunk' = 'our pens'? Or does it only apply in certain grammatical contexts, eg 'We all shook our heads.'
== Plurality of the possessed object is marked on the object itself. Cf.
Elvesztettük férjünket vs. Elvesztettük férjeinket.

4) When -ott/-ett/-ött are used for position at a place, what are used for movement to and from? (eg Is it Győrre and Győrről?)
== Depends on the composition of the proper noun. E.g., if it contains 'vár' (castle), you may have to use -ra and -ról, but with
Győr, you only use -be/-ből, unless you convey a different meaning (beszélgettünk Győrről).

5) Is -vá/-vé also sometimes used on adjectives to make adverbs as well as being used on nouns?
== Yes. (Hasonlóvá, igazzá, naggyá).

6) What does -stul/-stül mean?
== The 'associative' suffix, meaning 'along with', 'complete with'. Make sure to add the possessive mark in between.
Cf. ház - a - stul (together with the house), férj-e-stül (together with the husband). [kfabricz@vnet.hu]

| &amp;nbsp;
| Definite present tense plural;&lt;br&gt;
Difference in verbs ending with -s, -sz, -z, -dz (1st, 2nd and 3rd plural definite present);&lt;br&gt;
Suffix type: Uniquely, most 2nd plural forms have -o and -e as a pair for vowel harmony (-tok/ -tek), also link vowel -o/ -e/ -ö;&lt;br&gt;
Other small verb irregularities, eg üdvözöl, érez, végez (present tenses)
| &amp;nbsp;
| No reduced vowels - vowel length is independent of word stress
| &amp;nbsp;
| In English, long vowels cannot normally occur in unstressed syllables so these are difficult
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| 19
| &amp;nbsp;
| Partially irregular verbs: 'lesz', 'tesz', 'vesz', 'hisz', 'visz', 'eszik', 'iszik', 'alszik', 'fekszik' (infinitive stem differs from indefinite present 3rd singular);&lt;br&gt;
Infinitives for 'jön', 'megy' and 'van';&lt;br&gt;
Partial overlap between verbs 'van' and 'lesz';&lt;br&gt;
Possessive suffix comes first when combined with another suffix, eg 'lakásomban';&lt;br&gt;
-ról/ -ről for 'about';&lt;br&gt;
'az egyik' for 'one of' and 'the one';&lt;br&gt;
'más' for 'different';&lt;br&gt;
'egy másik' for 'another' and 'a másik' for 'the other';&lt;br&gt;
'a többiek' for 'the others';&lt;br&gt;
'minden' for 'each', 'every' and 'all'
| &amp;nbsp;
| Long vowels in unstressed syllables
| &amp;nbsp;
| For vowel practice, always include examples in unstressed syllables as well as stressed syllables
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| 20
| &amp;nbsp;
| Explanation of topic and of sentence focus;&lt;br&gt;
Negatives and question words always take the focus;&lt;br&gt;
Position of focus in a sentence:&lt;br&gt;
a) Focus of sentence is positioned immediately before the finite verb&lt;br&gt;
b) Verb which is focused is at beginning of sentence&lt;br&gt;
c) When 'van' is omitted, focus of sentence is at beginning of sentence&lt;br&gt;
Word order in a sentence: topic + focus + finite verb + other elements;&lt;br&gt;
Postpositions
| &amp;nbsp;
| Sentence stress on topic and focus
| &amp;nbsp;
| There may be some mistakes in the information on word order.

== Re: Grammar questions ==

Hi! Short answers for the questions in the 'Grammar questions' section:
1.) The nouns with -n: 
*Usually, they use the &quot;normal&quot; stem…, eg lev''é''len, fal''u''n;  
**but there are some exceptions: eg tav''o''n (not *''tón'')

Some other suffixes (cases) (like the sociative case, distributive case, etc.) also use the oblique stem. 

2.) I'm not really sure I understand this. If -lek/lak is used to form the &quot;Subject:1th sing; Object:2nd sing/plur&quot; case^&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of a verb, the object can be plural (eg nagyon szeretlek téged = I love you /sing/ very much; nagyon szeretlek titeket = I love you /plur/ very much)

3.) You're right, it's 'a fejünk', not a *''fejeink''. It may also apply to other things (like ''tollunk'', ''kárunk'', ''eszünk''). There may be some exceptions though, but now I couldn't mention any. :-)

&lt;s&gt;4.) Yes, it's ''Győrre'' and ''Győrről'', ''Pécsre'' and ''Pécsről'', etc.&lt;/s&gt; (''Sorry, I didn't notice that you were talking about &quot;movement&quot;. The correct answer is in the [[#Re: Győr]] section. --[[User:194.152.154.2|194.152.154.2]] 00:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)'')

5.) -vá/vé is used on adjectives (as well as on nouns), but I don't think that it's used to make adverbs.^&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Stupid examples: 
*&quot;A Head&amp;Shoulders /sampon/ széppé varázsolta a királynő haját&quot; [szép''p''é = szép (adj.) + vé] &amp;rarr; &quot;Head&amp;Shoulders /shampoo/ made the Queen's hair /look/ beautiful&quot;; 
*&quot;A boszorkány békává változtatta a királynőt&quot; [békává = béka (noun) + vá] &amp;rarr; The witch turned the Queen into a frog.

6.) -stul/stül: It is used to form the [[w:Sociative case]], and as you can read in the enWP article it's now considered obsolete. An example: &quot;Tartsa meg a házát, ''udvarostul'', az ezer aranyat meg ráadásnak.&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;Keep your house, together with the yard, plus the thousand red golds /money/.&quot;

== Re: Győrre/Győrről ==

In response to question 4.) above: both &quot;Győrre&quot; and &quot;Győrről&quot; sound rather strange to me (in this sense), though I wouldn't call them wrong. &quot;Győrbe megyek&quot; or Győrbe költözöm&quot; sounds a lot more natural to me. Similarly, &quot;Győrből jövök&quot; or &quot;Győrből származom&quot; is the form in my idiolect. &quot;Győrre&quot; is of course the correct form when saying for example &quot;Győrre gondolok&quot;. Let me add that I'm a native speaker living in Hungary.

== Good insight is not enough :( ==

The plan seems alright (though I don't speak Hungarian and I merely know a little). Now, the problem is it looks like nobody cares. Something has to be wrong with Hungarians and I've no idea what that might be. It's amazing for how long they haven't put the slightest effort to EXPAND this Wikibook. Maybe they just don't want foreigners to learn their native language? Isn't it great when your mother tongue is spoken by ten million people in your country and understood by approximately a thousand or so peasants in the remotest parts of Northern Russia? Oh, yeah, DEFINITELY!! As a Bulgarian, who encounters no difficulties when communicating in countries such as Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosna and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Russia, I'm really amazed at how this people appear to treat the topic. Albeit not the best example, the Bulgarian Language Wikibook could give you an idea at how you should appreciate your language. I realise you probably hold Hungarian in high esteem yet I can't tell that from your Hungarian Language Wikibook. In this regard I beg you to endeavour to improve it!

== Re: Győr ==

Hungarian place names ending in -m, -n, -ny, -j, -r, -ly, take the -ban, -ben, -ba, -be, -ból, -ből suffixes.

== Re: Good insight is not enough :( ... but polemics are even worse ==

Ah, please, refrain from the polemics. This wikibook is not excellent, so that must mean that Hungarians (every single one!) do not care about their language! Ridiculous. Maybe people who care about the survival of Hungarian are working to establish and maintain Hungarian language schools for children where the language is under threat of extinction or in decline - Romania (Transylvania, Moldova), Serbia, Ukraine, etc. 

But they do not do these things. So there is some problem with the Hungarians indeed (just look at the stance of the Hungarian Wikipedia sites.) I try to help you (I am native) but maybe there are three or four people here who are Hungarians. So far I was doing the Swedish wikipedia, because I thought that there are a lot of Hungarians here - so proud as they are of their knowledge and so few they share. That is what's ridiculous...
[[User:Svenskafan|Svenskafan]] 21:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

:Not many Hungarians know that the Wikibook project even exists. And even if they know, few are trained to &quot;teach&quot; Hungarian as a foreign language. --[[User:194.152.154.2|194.152.154.2]] 00:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

== Someone adept in grammar?? ==

hi,

I started expanding Hungarian Wikipédia and Hungarian-related articles in foreign Wikipedias a month ago but nowhere experienced such negligence. It's outrageous that such a great and widely appreciated language doesnt have a proper wiki language book... really. Anyone - be native or not - who is adept in grammar to join me in expanding this stub? - [[User:Tylop|Tylop]] 15 July 2006

Well I started to revamp this book if someone who considers himself/herself a linguist decides to check its correctness, I'd be very glad - [[User:Tylop|Tylop]]

== Omitting &quot;van&quot; ==
[[Hungarian/Lesson_3#Omitting &quot;van&quot;]]
I'm not a linguist just a Hungarian, but are you dead sure, that we use the substantive verb (van) in 1st person. I don't say ''Én éhes vagyok'', but simply ''Éhes vagyok.''. And the same applies to 2nd person, too: ''Éhes vagy.'' (or ''Éhes vagy?'' or ''Éhes vagy!'' :-) ). I just ask before correcting, because it is so well described there, that maybe there is a similar rule but the example is wrong and I misunderstood.
Do you guys agree that we (nearly) always omit &quot;van&quot;? - [http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Totya User:Totya] 2006. Oct. 4 16:47 UTC

   &quot;Éhes vagyok.&quot; - It's not (the 1st person of) &quot;van&quot; that is omitted, it's the word &quot;én&quot; (I) that is missing in that sentence...

::When the &quot;be&quot; verb functions as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)|copula] in the third person (otherwise van, vannak), it takes a zero form; that is, it does not appear, e.g., Géza katona (Géza is a soldier), ő éhes (s/he is hungry), etc. More on this in the zero copula article on Wikipedia.

::In your examples you didn't omit the verb 'van' but the personal pronoun. Personal pronouns are omitted unless the emphasis is on them e.g.:
::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| -Ki éhes? || -Who's hungry?
|-
| -Én éhes vagyok. || -I'm hungry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost every problem can be solved in more ways than one. A simple example, that of going to work, for instance, illustrates this, and also the fact that we choose a solution to achieve a valued purpose. Thus, there may be several ways to travel from home to work: by bus, bike, car or by walking perhaps, and there may be a choice of several routes. The decision made is a successful one if we arrive at work, on time, and have also met any other valued purposes (such as obtaining some exercise, or buying a newspaper on the way). 

Or, consider our previous dressing-for-work example. Our work environment may dictate that we dress somewhat formally, but we may be able to do so in a number of ways. Consequently, we might decide based upon what was worn yesterday, or we may let our feelings decide, simply satisfying our mood of the moment. We discussed these kinds of choices earlier, and we noted that the criteria we use to make our decision is found in an environment that is external to the mind itself.

However, situations are never as simple as those portrayed in the examples mentioned. Probing more deeply will show that every decision we make is affected by attempts to meet one or more psychological needs that exist entirely within the mind. For example, what we finally choose to wear may have been decided in an attempt to impress the boss, or to win our friends’ admiration, or to heighten our self-concept. These goals or purposes are seldom known to others, and may be only partly known to ourselves.

We may think that some decisions can only be made objectively, and that private, subjective, or personal goals may play no part in them, but this is incorrect. As an example, imagine that we have to choose a bolt to anchor a structure we are building. We decide what size to use based upon what we know about the structure’s mass and orientation, the strength of materials, type of foundation and so on. We are using our knowledge of the external physical environment, of course. But we also make this choice based on our personal desire for the structure to endure. Quite a different choice could be made if our private purpose was to sabotage the result. Whether or not our private purposes override the public purposes depends upon our psychological state of mind.

Thus, every time we make practical decisions we consult two environments. One is external to our mind and public; it contains all the facts and criteria required to select solutions that will satisfy its needs, and any suitably knowledgeable person could make an identical decision. The other environment is internal to the mind and private; it contains all the personal goals, self-chosen purposes, and maybe several (probably unrecognized) psychological needs that also influence each final decision.

However, only one environment is involved when making ''moral'' decisions—our own internal mental mind-set. It has to provide the environment, the criteria to be met, and the goals to value and seek. Thus, there may be no constraints upon what people may decide is moral or what are moral actions. Of course, religions provide environments and guidelines (i.e., criteria), but those without a religion, or who reject their society’s norms, have nothing other than their own personal mental constructs&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Revelations And Conversions/]] for an elaboration of this term.&lt;/ref&gt; to consult when deciding how to act. Having only one’s own mental environment to guide one’s actions can have significant and terrible consequences (as the activities of numerous psychopaths throughout history have demonstrated).

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Now we are ready to return to the situation introduced in section four of the last chapter. We were imagining a person who has no religion, yet who wants to live a moral life. Consider what such a person faces—where might he or she find the valued purpose needed to guide moral decision making? The physical environment holds no purpose in the moral arena. The transitory social environment is nugatory. Religious sources are considered unreliable or even false. No external environment holds a purpose worthy of being used to make a moral decision, and the mind, when lacking any belief system, holds none.

Search as they may, individuals in this position cannot solve moral problems, for there is nowhere else to look.&lt;ref&gt;According to Postman, individuals lacking a sense of purpose can fall into a state of psychic disorientation and become preoccupied by a frantic search for meaning. See Neil Postman, ''Building a Bridge to the Eighteenth Century: How the Past Can Improve Our Future'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2000), 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Postman subsequently postulates that we have no better choice than to search the past to find where to go in the future. I strongly disagree. We are where we are today because of our past thoughts and actions. While this has led to considerable human progress we have made mistakes. Surely we can do better—searching the past for ideas seems a prescription for repeating past mistakes. Moreover, all environments change over time, and historical environments no longer exist. To find where to go in the future, we must look in that direction. In fact, there may be a highly satisfactory beacon to be found in the future, one that does generate a sense of purpose and certainty. The outlook I have in mind will be discussed in Part Four; it is one that could only be determined using today’s knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mind has to know and value the attainment of some purpose before it can make any decision rationally, minds lacking relevant purposes cannot make moral decisions rationally. For some, this mental state of affairs may churn for years. Such individuals may eventually give up the search, and simply choose to abide by social customs. Others in this condition may look at various religions and find a way out by adopting one, or bits and pieces of several. For a few, neither choice is feasible, and the dilemma escalates. Every decision to be made appears to be causally related to this missing purpose. The mind’s primary function of directing the body’s behaviour becomes incapacitated, and its owner may sink into depression, claiming, quite correctly, that they see no purpose to life, and that without purpose life has no meaning&lt;ref&gt;See a postscript to this chapter, [[../../Purpose And Meaning/]], for a discussion of the words “purpose” and “meaning.”&lt;/ref&gt; and they have no reason to live. A mental breakdown can easily result.

In all of this behaviour, we must remember, the mind is being entirely rational. If a moral environment of some kind is not available, then, although everyday language allows moral problems to be posed, no satisfactory solutions can be found, because without a desired purpose decisions can’t be made rationally.

Apart from insanity or death, there is only one way through this impasse. The mind has to accept a solution that it has been considering, possibly consciously, certainly subconsciously, but which has hitherto been rejected for one reason or another. Some formerly unacceptable metaphysical purpose must be reclassified as desirable. For this to happen such a purpose has to be accepted as representing the truth—it must be sanctioned by the mind itself. The mind’s decision-making expertise will then be freed from its confining tangle of unacceptable choices, its state of constant stress will vanish, and it will at last find peace. This acceptance of a purpose almost always happens in a split second, occurring unexpectedly (and often appearing fully formed) to the affected individuals. They experience it as a &quot;revelation&quot; and may undergo a &quot;conversion&quot;. ([[../../Revelations And Conversions/]] further discusses these phenomena.)

It does not matter what this purpose is.&lt;ref&gt;The metaphysical purpose adopted by many Westerners to guide their moral decision making is to do their best to ensure that they will continue living beyond death. A “soul” or equivalent is usually postulated to exist, since it is clearly not possible to continue living in a body that decays when dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In contrast, the metaphysical purpose adopted by many Easterners is to stop living beyond death. A series of progressive reincarnations is the accepted way to achieve this. (Features of major religions are outlined in [[../../Present Day Religions/]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Absolutely any criteria can be used to judge behaviour as “good” or “bad.” (A “moral” person could even be considered an “evil monster” by another's standards.) What matters is that the mind’s previous quandary has vanished, and it can once again resume its function of thinking rationally as it directs the body’s functions.&lt;ref&gt;The mind’s prime requirement to think rationally about important issues accounts for the extreme lengths to which people may go in order to behave in accordance with such beliefs. More about this in [[../../Revelations And Conversions/]].&lt;/ref&gt;

But let us return, for a moment, to the instant of reclassification—the mind’s conversion from an absence, to an acceptance, of some mental environment containing both criteria and purpose. For the mind to take advantage of such a contrivance it must have already been stored in memory. Most of us have religious memories provided to us by our parents or teachers, and we all have some understanding of the beliefs in vogue in our society. This formerly discounted knowledge is often the environment grasped when the mind is under the kind of stress earlier discussed.

The newly converted typically accept unconditionally all that is contained within the religion (whether spiritual or secular) whose purpose they have suddenly adopted. Not infrequently, the intensity of emotion associated with this metamorphosis moves the converted to tell others what they have come to believe. That which, when they were non-believers, was simply “good” or “bad” behaviour, has suddenly become “right” or “wrong” behaviour to the new believer. This kind of distinction marks the transition—moral judgements have replaced value judgements for them.

Very occasionally, the straw grasped during conversion is not an existing religion but some abstraction, probably imaginatively pieced together by the mind’s owner in earlier, restless, years. A new metaphysical purpose may be recognized to be valid, important and desirable. This new purpose may or may not centre around a belief in a god—but there are not many choices when it comes to inventing a purpose deemed important enough to guide moral decision making. (This is why people normally convert to existing religions; they have no alternative in mind. This book will be suggesting one later.)

A few, undergoing such a transformative mental revision, become convinced that they are another messiah: they become a prophet, one who has “seen the light.” The conversion they experience is so real to them, so significant—the vision and clarity of the new truth so bright—that they cannot contain their emotions nor refrain from trying to convince others that they have found the most important manifestation in life (for, to them, it is the most important). They proselytize. And the vivacity and clarity of the words they speak attract the undecided. Cults and sects form, and eventually, if the number of followers continues to grow, additional leaders develop, (see [[../../Religions' Origins/Leaders|Leaders]]). Eventually the originator may be revered and loved as the founder of a great religion. We will be exploring this phenomenon in Part Two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before moving to Part Two, it may be helpful to summarize a few of the points that have been made in the past three chapters. The following are important.

The universe’s causal construction dictates that inhabitants who think and act rationally have a greater chance of surviving, procreating and succeeding, than those who do not. This, in turn, has favoured the genetic continuation of mutations which help minds to work in this manner.

Practical problem solving and decision making entails consulting external environments to find the criteria that acceptable solutions must meet, then consulting the mind’s internal environment to find what personal purpose is sought.

Moral problem solving and decision making entails consulting the mind’s own environment to find both the criteria for acceptable solutions, and the purpose being sought. Mental environments are always invented ones (composed, as we saw in [[../../Thinking/]], from linked memories of perceived events, experiences and learnings, all tinged by the choice of words used when envisioning them consciously), and have no reality outside the minds of those who subscribe to them.

Religious environments are made real to individuals through faith or belief. Belief provides a feeling of certainty; however this exacts a price. Belief can cause us to ignore, override, or transcend some of the more substantive reality that constitutes the rational universe we inhabit. In time, this may lead us into grey pastures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What a wonderful manifestation is the mind. From its elemental beginnings when it simply helped the body to survive, the mind has become an instrument exquisite. It creates individuals of us all, and provides flights of fancy any time we care to climb aboard. Is there anything it might not do in the future?

But, does the mind do all this on its own, or does some Guiding Hand help it on its way? These flights and fancies; these revelations and beliefs—from whence have they come? Are they solely the product of a rational mind working in a rational universe, or might some of such thoughts have come from a god?

It is important to the theme of this book to determine how beliefs, in particular, come to mind, for they have greatly affected our past, are certainly affecting our present, and may well dictate our future. If we contend that certain beliefs are god-given, we might act in one manner; if we discover that all beliefs may have a more mundane origin, then we might be persuaded to think and act more circumspectly, for we would expect no saviour’s help should anything go wrong. Thus, Part Two explores the origins of beliefs.

'''Note''': Moved stuff from Staff lounge:

Hi, I'm [[w:User:Func]] from Wikipedia. I'm not familiar with Wikibooks policies, but I wanted to draw attention to your [[The Manual of Crime]], and its subpages like [[The Manual of Crime: Rape]]. Whether for legal reasons or simply human decency, may I suggest that a crime ''manual'' that includes content such as this:
:''Many rapists use a gun or a knife to threaten their victims with bodily harm to keep them compliant. You may hear things like &quot;stop, please&quot; but don't let that discourage you. Tonight is your night. Don't let anything stand in your way.''
may not be the sort of thing Wikibooks should be hosting. Thanks. [[User:70.20.207.198|70.20.207.198]] 02:02, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

:::There's a fundamental confusion in this discussion on why this particular quote is offensive and inappropriate. The above quote clearly promotes rape as a good activity that the reader should strive for, a POV position Wikibooks shouldn't take. This is for the same reason Wikibooks should edit or delete an engineering book that says you should or must build bridges. That's not how-to, it's advocacy without basis. A book explaining  rape might explain that children are most likely to be raped by someone within (or close to) the family puts most readers in a better position to notice, prevent, or otherwise take appropriate action when the issue come up. (The old &quot;stranger-danger&quot; thing is pretty much a bunch of BS) Yes, such a book could tell would-be rapists that they are more likely to get away with preying on family members. But the idea that Wikibooks is going to stop rapes by locking down all descriptions of how rapes occur is pretty unlikely  - you're more likely to prevent them, or more likely cause one and prevent five. I wish I could read a book on how thieves case a house, so that I could identify weaknesses in my own house. I also note that a book on making pot brownies has already been deleted from Wikibooks. Now, I haven't  read it, so maybe it glorified  the consumption of drugs in a POV way. But without any book available on this topic, a parent is less able to see the clues that their 14-year-old has a drug problem. The bottom line is that any old pothead can figure out to saute pot  in butter and then add the butter to any food (or how to rape, or murder). It's the non-potheads, non-rapists, non-murderers that need the help of a Wikibook to see and understand what other people are doing.[[User:Twestgard|Twestgard]] 18:45, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

However, there's plenty of other knowledge we don't find suitable for wikibooks (E.g., &quot;A Book on the Things in My Living Room&quot;).

*'''Delete''' - The more I thought about it, the more I realized there is little instructional value in putting this all into one book. If a book on sociology gets into what criminals do, that's fine; If a book on electrical engineering gets into weaknesses of home security systems (a little), that's fine; If a book on chemistry mentions highly explosive combinations, that's fine. But I don't think we should put them all in a single book, without the editorial guidance of what is appropriate as an instructional resource. Maybe after a couple of years, when we have some more completed books, and we're being used in the classroom, we can revisit the issue of what a book like this would do to our credibility.

*'''No Vote Yet''', I'm undecided. We can certainly cover techniques without worrying about the legality of their demonstration--indeed several TV series teach burglar-safing by having a guy break into a house while the audience watches through his first-person headband cam--but they shouldn't be worded in a way that sounds like it's talking ''exclusively'' to those doing or thinking of doing these crimes. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:44, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' - A few points here:
** This sort of material (including the Rape chapter) might be considered valid under the first amendment. Could we be prosecuted for removing it?
** If we should decide that, say, &quot;any content which is written as an incitement to break the law (in the US), should be disallowed&quot;, then we should add that to our exclusions list on [[Wikibooks:About]], thus similar content can be speedied without a vote.
** If this sort of material was written as a subpage of &quot;Jokebook&quot;, would that be acceptable?
** If this sort of material was re-written under a book title named &quot;Criminology - A guide to the psyche of the criminal mind&quot;, would that be okay? See also my comment from ages ago at [[Wikibooks talk:Staff lounge#Controversial Issues]]. [UNSIGNED]

***The first ammendment only applies to the government.  Individuals and groups other than the government can censor as they wish.  So no, noone can be prosecuted for violating the first ammendment, except a city, state or federal government.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 15:54, August 18, 2005 (UTC)

* We should probably heavily revise and edit out the unsavory material. And then generate a warning template that would get applied to each page. We should also combine it with any other books or articles that follow the same vein. Additionally, a title change should be in order; something that can show that none of the material is being encouraged. (But perhaps I'm being too generous, perhaps we should just delete the whole thing and stick to textbooks, cookbooks, and jokebooks.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:51, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

* Follow-up: Let's not worry about breaking non-United States laws. I'm sure much of our material is forbidden in North Korea, for example. As for &quot;UNSIGNED&quot;: No, we could not be prosecuted. The first amendment gives you the right to say what you want, but it does not give you the right to say what you want as a tattoo on everyone else. We control the content of these servers, and it's our privilege to exclude from it anything we want. A sub-page of the jokebook is unacceptable: these should have heavy warnings, and should not taken lightly. Also, this shouldn't be a guide to anyone's mind. It could be a guide to techniques, however. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:03, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''- While I don't personally condone the topic, I'd say that illegality alone is not enough to outlaw a book.  I'm for deleting things like the rape section, but there needs to be better reasons to delete things than content describing an illegal act in the US- there's plenty of things illegal in the US but not other countries (we are an international site), and there are valid reasons to violate US law (such as civil disobediance).

*'''Comment''' Wikibookians: Please, let's not discuss legal issues or free speech issues here. They are a total distraction. I know many of you have immediate reactions to promote freedom. But that is not the battle we are fighting here. The question is: '''Is The Manual of Crime an instructional resource?''' Is this something that you'd ever see in a class room? No, that's highly doubtful. I don't think things like this are either in the letter or the spirit of the WikiBooks project. Now, if wikicities accepts this under a crime group, or whatever, then it should be housed there. But even if it can't be transfered over there, we should delete it. It's just a worse and worse fit for what we all do. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:43, 18 August 2005 (UTC)
*:Agreed that legal/free speech issues are not the critical issue. However, I do think at least parts of MoC are instructional and although they would not be taught in a classroom environment, are still valid in the context of wikibooks. In particular, &quot;Fighting&quot; (framed as self-defense nobody would bat an eye), &quot;LSD&quot; (making of drugs is instructional), &quot;Cannibis&quot; (&quot;growing cannibus&quot; would probably be a non-issue), &quot;Explosives&quot; (think army manuals), &quot;Buying&quot; (valid for any purchase you don't want traced). The others are more shades of gray based on their content, but I tend to think they are still valid as instructional even if unsavory. To note, [[Getting a Girl]] was deleted since it was obviously POV, and of very poor quality. Jimbo expressed a concern that the existing policy would need to be modified if GaG was voted as a keep, since it didn't fit his view of what WB should be, but also noted that GaG could probably be re-written to fit WB -- I think that's the case here.

*::Let's not put words in Jimbo's mouth. I don't think it was the POV that was the issue with GaG. But if you want to talk about Criminology, we should say everything in a Criminology book. That way, the book could stay on topic and not also house unsavory content. As for the explosives, we could have books that contain that, but only if each and every page has big, bold warnings and disclaimers. But the book as-is is not suitable for WB.

If the decision is to keep the book, then I'm going to act to change policy so as to eliminate the book anyway. It seems unfortunate if it comes to that. A healthier process would be to reach a more clear understanding of the mission of WikiBooks, and the development of alternatives if people really want them. But I will not tolerate a book like this under the auspices of the Wikimedia Foundation. It is offensive, sexist, and stupid. --Jimbo Wales 22:27, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One more one last comment. I would support a vote about what to do about the book. Deletion is not the only viable option. My main point is that &quot;accepting it&quot; as-is, is not possible. It could be rewritten into a proper text, it could be moved (to wikicities, say), it could be deleted. I want the community here to feel empowered to make decisions.

* '''Delete''' Not within the purpose of Wikibooks. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 17:29, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' - An important part of learning is the restraint to use knowledge wisely; The ability to apply your judgement and accept the consequences of your actions with the fullest possible understanding of the situation and no compulsion from an outside force. As to the question of the validity of this material as instructional, many of the pages discuss technique and consequences in detail with little PoV and also preventative measures for the crimes detailed. Certainly the book deserves review and improvement, but it does not deserve deletion. As for credibility, it strikes me    that this is a problem for another time. If inquiries are raised by those to whomever is intended credible presentation, then it is time to deal with the issue. Pre-emptive credibility, however prudent, does not strike me as the goal of this project, which I believe would benefit from a case-by-case approach to credibility as related by those to whom credibility is desired.

*:For what it's worth, the Wikibooks project is not the sole entity responsible for all of learning, nor are we ever planning on taking up that responsibility. :-) The material in question will still be accessible over the web in some other way. But the ''source'' of the information provides a valuable signal. I'm sure that many of the stuff in this &quot;textbook&quot; can't even be verified. If someone were to see it on a site with less prestige than wikibooks then that would be a valuable signal. Wikibooks just doesn't covey useful information about what we say, it contains just as much useful information in what we *don't* say. For example, you won't find on our pages modules upon modules of pure random information. I'm sure random information has some use, but filtering the noise to get a stronger signal is much more useful. Less is more sometimes. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:12, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

I can understand a holistic approach, but does license to delete the spurious to provide an environment which is itself instructional necessitate the removal of the morally or legally complex? I have heard that many of the servers are hosted in America, so I could understand removal of the content on legal reasons if it was challenged by an authority. Perhaps this book and other of its type deserve warnings or special sections? I'll stick with keep for now, but I understand if the community goes the other way.

* '''Delete''' While some of the topics covered are in and of themselves valid areas of inquiry, it is inappropriate to present this material in the context of a how-to manual for criminal activity.  If this book is against Wikibooks policy, great -- if not, Wikibooks policy should change.  The section on fighting is perhaps redeemable in a different context, as this is a skill that is legitimately taught.  Other sections, in addition to being contrary to the Wikibooks mission (or at least outside the broader Wikimedia foundation mission), are poorly written and wildly inaccurate.  Policy wise, I believe that wikibooks should present topics in a fashion that, assuming an audience of adults, is socially responsible.  Presenting inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading information about any dangerous activity is irresponsible.  Presenting a purported how-to work on morally reprehensible activities (kidnapping, arson, etc) is not socially responsible.  [[User:UninvitedCompany|UninvitedCompany]] 02:23, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

*** The idea of moving the MoC to WikiCities has been rolling around for a bit with the idea that because it is not a deletion of the book, because the information is preserved, there should be no problem with moving it and no reason to keep it here. I feel that this is a poor decision because moving the book does change it. The forum in which information is presented changes how the information is viewed. If the project is moved to wikicities, it loses credibility because it ceases to be a textbook. It becomes less than the other books here because it is in a different place. Moving it outside of the wikibooks project also cuts down the ease with which people can find the information. These issues aside, moving the book to wikicities also sacrifices much of the control over the book. The book is currently written from a neutral, instructional standpoint with sections on preventive measures. This can be maintained because of the structure of wikibooks. Wikicities lacks the authority over the material that wikibooks has. In wikicities this book would rapidly become unbalanced. Because wikicities does not have the same network of dedicated admins and beareaucrats it lacks the same capability to deal with vandals. This work does not belong in wikicities. And you cannot use wikicities as a dumping ground for undesirable projects. --[[User:Esoterica|Esoterica]] 05:55, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
**** Wikicities explicitly prohibits this kind of content, so moving it there is not an option (see [http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Prohibited_content content prohibited on Wikicities]). If this books is deleted from here, it's gone forever. Wikibooks is a better place for it, because we don't censor particular types of content (like Wikicities does). I don't think that we should censor any kind of topic, as long as it forms an instructional book. With that said, I think that we should encourage contributors to rewrite this book, and others like it, to be instructional resources on how one can avoid becoming a victim of each particular crime (while not excluding any technical details about how each crime is committed). The rape page was obviously not phrased acceptably, but a correctly written version should be acceptable.

**Both you Geo and Esoterica have proved my points: (1) The location of a book matters. Wikibooks's good name is harmed by being associated with this book, while this book may be percieved as more legitimate in the eyes of others. Thus, the works of hundreds of other books is diminished by a reputation-killing book. I can just hear the teachers now: &quot;What? You mean teach a class using a wikibook? Our school banned the whole site.&quot; And (2) If this material isn't even allowed on wikicities, we have no business at all having it on wikibooks.&lt;p&gt;A point you didn't prove for me: (3) Give up using the word &quot;censor,&quot; that's nonsense. We aren't stopping anyone else from putting things up on their own wikis or websites. We simply don't have that power. We only have editorial control over our own work. Censorship would be when we could ''control the content of sites we don't even own.''&lt;p&gt;A final point, (4) under no circumstances would a rape section be appropriate in any book titled &quot;The Manual of Crime.&quot; If you want to discuss rape and the horrible effects it has on women and men, and the very sick individuals who do it, then it should go in a criminology or sociology book and be treated in that context. This is not a matter of how offensively written it is or not, so long as it is a how-to (instead of describing it in an academic context as one of the most violent offences possible) it has no place here.

Suppose someone started a book called &quot;History of the KKK&quot;...but they tried to put the KKK in a positive light? That could be considered a &quot;work of hate&quot;. But I think it would be edited for NPOV, NOT deleted entirely. This is how Wikibooks should work, right?

:::::Of course, there are those who would argue that if we allow info about such &quot;hate groups&quot; that it would inspire others to emulate them. So, ignorance is better.

::::::That's a fundamental misunderstanding of the argument. Imagine you have a car, and I really want to put a bumper sticker on it. Maybe you'd let me, considering you like all possible forms of information or some such. But maybe you've also decided it's your own car... regardless of what you think the consequences of the bumper sticker would be it's your right to have nothing on your own bumper if you so choose. Similarly, it's your right to have just the stickers you choose. A book like this one is not what Jimbo had in mind. It's not what the people who gave money to Wikibooks had in mind. The position is not that we're sitting here worried about what the book would inspire (overall, I don't think there are many real world consequences if we kept it; I firmly believe people aren't idiots); it's just that we've bought our own car and already had a plan of what we wanted to put on the bumper. And we're politely declining the offer of a sticker we don't care to have. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:56, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

Are you implying that consensus has been reached? [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 23:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::Further, how is &quot;The Manual of Crime&quot; ''not'' a textbook? It sure looks like a textbook to me, albeit an unusual one.

:::::Also, I am not &quot;up in arms&quot; about anything. I just think that things should be called what they are. Look up the definition of &quot;censorship&quot;. Sure, we have the right to censor Wikibooks. But, it is still censorship. You see a book that has info you consider unethical, you want it deleted...and that is merely &quot;editing&quot;? Not censorship? [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 20:50, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

::::::OK, we can call it censorship if you want. I don't think that's very useful, because think about it: You support the NPOV guideline. Thus you support censorship. That's why I was asking you if you were up in arms over our NPOV policy, because it can just as well be labeled as censorship (and I was not claiming you were up in arms, I was asking why you ''weren't'' up in arms). Why do I not throw that label around? Because we aren't talking about censorship. We've ''already'' decided to disallow fiction and to disallow non-NPOVs, there's no ambiguity about that fact. The people who've spent money on this site want this site to be that way. Still, if you are interested in having a wiki for everything I encourage you to spend the $5/month on a server with doorhost.net, and you can even install the mediawiki software on it! If you can't afford that, perhaps you can ask for donations. But in general I think people are more excited about donating to projects with specific purposes rather than very-general-no-results-to-ever-show exercises. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:56, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:::::::Whether or not I start my own wiki has nothing to do with the topic. And the existence of this book makes Wikibooks &quot;too general&quot; and doomed to failure? Wow! That's a pretty powerful statement. What do you base it on? Also, you seem to think consensus has been reached here. I do not. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 23:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

(&lt;&lt; moving back to the left) Actually I think he was boldly suggesting that ''your'' hosting of this content would be doomed to failure. The scope of each Wikimedia project must be clearly defined, indeed in order for the board to even look at it it must have a clear statement of what it will and won't cover. The central themes of the Wikimedia Foundation (basically those at [[w:Wikipedia:Five pillars]]) are unchangeable. [[#Jimbo's recommendation on Wikibooks policy|Jimbo's basically said]] a repeat of his Getting a Girl statement, that if our organic discussion doesn't end with this work's deletion then he will reluctantly step in and forcibly change policy in order to get it deleted.

Now, say we keep this, and then I write ''The history of the KKK'' and include a chapter titled &quot;How to Properly Lynch a Filthy Nigger&quot;. Now I could claim that it was written from the KKK's perspective, that it would be a great learning aid to help people see inside the minds of the Klansmen. What about the well-researched ''How To Psyche Yourself Up and Buy Supplies for a Successful Suicide Bombing''? Or the brilliant step-by-step clarity of ''How To Gas a Jew''? Now will we collectively be pulling in six digits quarterly once our generous sponsors find one of the Wikimedia projects is hosting ''that'' horrendous stuff?

Yes those examples went rather overboard but with good reason; if we allow the MoC, by definition we must also allow similar &quot;in the mind of xyz&quot; books, to keep one but exclude another would be a violation of NPOV. It's all or nothing. And that's what we must avoid at all costs. As for whether we have consensus, many of the keep voters have basically said &quot;if it's rewritten&quot;. Now who is going to do that? The whole slant of this book is &quot;I'll guide you through xyz&quot; rather than &quot;how xyz is done&quot;. I think a book on criminology is an excellent topic, and indeed I would help contribute what little I know to such a book were it ever written, but ''this'' book isn't it. The work involved in fixing this would basically mean writing this from scratch and using this book's chapter titles for inspiration on what topics to cover in it.

We've crossed the line and we gotta put our foot down, or else those horrible examples Garrett's talked about ''will'' be posted here. As soon as we get our policy in order (by reaching consensus on it, or through upper-level fiat) we'll be able to squash any further exercises of hate.

* '''Keep''' - Nothing is being harmed by association with a book, a book which deals with a topic such as this is just as contraversial as one dealing with sex statistics and techniques, that does not make it an invalid resource or a bad thing.  If there were a manual on fighting which told you how to snap a person's neck or break their windpipe, people may be outraged, but that book would still be useful and a book which belongs within the scope of educational.  There should only be one restriction on a book, if it teaches about a subject.  If it gives information on the how to, the practical and scientific, the socio-political and religious all belong here if they are actually giving information to people.  This book needs to be reworked a little, cleaned up, but deletion is not really merited. [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 18:44, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

* I'd strongly suggest speedy-deleting the &quot;Explosives&quot; chapter as well, as being a danger to anyone who tries to follow it.  The guy who wrote it is clearly incompetent: some of his &quot;anti-static&quot; precautions generate large amounts of static electricity, and his &quot;homemade missile&quot; will simply blow up on the launchpad. --[[User:65.101.119.25|65.101.119.25]] 21:10, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

* I'd just like to point out the the explosives section is laughably wrong. The fertilizer bomb will, at best, cause a simple gasoline fireball. There is no discussion of proper purification, drying, proportions, mixing, packing density, and storage. In general, the instructions for causing detonation are useless. You can't just put two wires near each other and hook them up to a watch! Many types of explosive would require a truly awesome electric arc if you wanted to use such a brute-force method. If the other sections are as bad, one need not fear a wikibooks-educated mugger or rapist. The procedures just don't work. [[User:24.170.177.130|24.170.177.130]] 00:13, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

'''Keep'''. As I posted on the book's talk page, I have come across it while doing professional research and it does present some useful information, conveniently available at one's fingertips without having to make a trip to the library (which is what I was going to do). I am not vouching for its quality as it is at the present moment, but a potentially useful resource nonetheless.--[[User:81.42.156.202|81.42.156.202]] 23:32, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

:'''Comment'''. Please excuse this mini-rant, but reading some of the comments here I couldn't help to feel some sympathy for the seemingly growing numbers of users who claim that the Wikipedia (and related Wikistuff) is being taken over by ''a bunch of neofascists''. I am sorry, but I am very suspicious of anyone who views the world through the prism of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;vice&quot; and &quot;virtue&quot;, &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; categories--what are you guys afraid of? Finally, on a marginal note, I found this comment on a VfD: ''Until you register, your vote isn't valid --Mijokijo 16:23, 1 September 2005 (UTC)''. I would like to remind that user that the point of the Wiki.* projects is that ''anyone'' can contribute. That is one of the reasons why people like myself proudly choose ''not'' to register under a name, even if we do contribute regularly to Wiki projects. There you go then, thanks for listening.

::Your vote is rightly viewed with more suspicion if you are unregistered since people will be less likely to recognize you as a contributing member of the community. That said, you are correct that it would be fallacious to discount unregistered users outright without checking their contributions. At least on wikibooks, under the ip you have there, you have [[Special:Contributions/81.42.156.202|few contributions]], and your &quot;vote&quot; could be discounted if we were in the business of vote counting. Since we are consensus based, your argument should be read and considered, but ultimately your consent is not needed (since at least from the info I have here, you are not a member of the &quot;wikibooks community&quot;). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:32, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
:::I think also eventually most regular contributors register under a name (because it doesn't have to be your real name), which actually gives them ''more'' privacy, because the IP is not shown then. Also, people are free to have multiple accounts to organize contributions by topic better. Also, Kellen is absolutely right that this is not a democracy: some votes are not considered at all while other votes can be given higher weight given the reputation of the contributor. Anyway, given all of that, it's a pretty meaningless signal for an anonymous IP to claim that it makes regular contributions: signals are only important when they can't be bluffed. Sorry to heap on all of the skepticism. Perhaps you're one of the many anons who spellcheck, revise, add, suggest and make our books so much better. If that's true, all I gotta say is, what are you waiting for? Get a good fake name, like WombatRupskin, and start earning a rep! [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:00, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''- I see some definite usefulness to this book, but I think it should be watched carefully by the community for very problematic stuff like the &quot;rape&quot; section.  Otherwise, I see value in sections like &quot;Fighting&quot; and such... again, as long as they're regularly and carefully edited to reflect proper technique so people don't inadvertently do something to get themselves seriously hurt.

*'''Delete''' - I don't know if anyone supporting this &quot;manual&quot; has considered this, but the very fact that something is called a &quot;manual of crime&quot; precludes the work's authenticity. I mean, really, are there any ''actual mobsters'' writing into the &quot;Racketeering&quot; section? Sensible burglars, robbers, and other criminals don't waste time writing about ways and means. Essentially, there is little to suggest that most of this &quot;manual&quot; isn't just a formatted sounding board, not for actual criminals, but voyeuristic ''crime enthusiasts.'' 
I would also like to point out that many do not consider marijuana growing akin to armed robbery or kidnapping, and it's annoying to find it with those topics, along with Fraud and Racketeering, in a &quot;Manual of Crime.&quot; The fact that cannabis exists under such a heading will almost certainly scare off and insult capable people that would want to contribute to the subject, as many &quot;grow your own&quot; types, including medicinal marijuana users, started growing to '''avoid''' the criminal element.--[[User:Stephen Tennant|Stephen Tennant]] 03:46, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

**I suppose that would depend on some of the entries. For example, I ''could'' see something like the anarchist's cookbook being a wikibook, or a book that details home security systems including their flaws. But that's only a &quot;could.&quot; If we allow too much stuff like this it hurts credibility (further, I wonder how credible any home securities system book would be in the first place, just in terms of accuracy).

== Other related &quot;tasteless&quot; books/pages ==

There have been other things like this in the past which got deleted, and some which did not. We need to formulate a good policy on this for future reference. Any policy sholud take acconut of the availability of information from other sources.  If you can get something from a library or work it out from a secondary education it should be allowed. 

Examples:

; Still existent

* [[How to Cause Havoc]]
* [[Jokebook:The Aristocrats]] The subject of a film that was advertised in at least 1 major national center-left paper. (and other pages from [[Jokebook]])
* [[Getting a girl (for guys)]]
* [[Acetone peroxide synthesis]] Obvious from a secondary education.
* [[Cookbook:Space Cake]] - A recipe for cake containing marijuana.

; Deleted

* Getting a girl - A text about getting a girlfriend (for men; a multigender version was also deleted)
* Cookbook:Special brownies - A recipe for brownies containing marijuana.
* Cookbook:Human - Using human flesh as a cooking ingredient (currently listed in [[WB:VFU]])
* Beating Season - A &quot;joke&quot; book about &quot;how to beat your wife&quot;. (currently listed in [[WB:VFU]])

Where do we draw the line? Personally, I have no problem with any of this content, because I'm an adult, and I'm prepared to accept other people's opinions regardless of how &quot;tasteless&quot; I might find them. We must also remain aware that children can easily access this site. What do others think? - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:14, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

:Note that perhaps even the Grand Theft Auto book might not be appropriate. (My take: GTA:SA should be in a gaming/walkthrough wikicity. Considering that the book generates so much traffic, it would really help WC out by bringing in all of that ad revenue. Keeping GTA:SA here is just leaving a lot of money on the table.) Going forward, the line should be drawn closer to text books. The big exceptions seem to be: wikiversity, the cook book, and the joke book. But until wikiversity.org, wikirecipes.org and wikijokes.org are all WM sister projects, here is the best place for them. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 21:26, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Regarding GTA, you might be right (in terms of tastelessness). Note also that the scope of this site is more than just textbooks.

::: From the wording on the page: &quot;any book you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop is acceptable&quot;. That would include GTA walkthrough (at least the bookshop part, but not the local library), though I still believe GTA is not an adequate textbook, and it does feel like a waste to see all of that ad revenue for such a popular browser destination to &quot;go away.&quot; However, you won't find in your local library or a local bookshop, say, the Anarchist's Cookbook, which is probably a book most similar to the one being discussed-- though the AC, I would claim, is less objectionable.

Nor is it a debate about the fact-checked, cleanly written, useful in classrooms, well organized book some of us may ''want'' MoC to be.

: Aya, I believe it's a distraction to talk about this as an issue of &quot;who is adult&quot; and &quot;who can access the site.&quot; The discussion is, what is wikibooks, and what do we want the project to be associated with? Children will always be able to find tastless stuff on the internet. It is pure hubris to act like this single project is the line that decides if they can or not. So, let's discuss the merits of wikibooks housing this class of non-instructional-use books. The Wikipedia has a lot of fringe material on it too, but it also has pretty strict standards on &quot;not notable enough&quot; content. We strictly don't allow fiction or original research... even though I assume you are adult enough to accept the existence of fiction and original research. I think we should add to that list of fiction and original research works that won't be in the classroom. As I've said before, books on Criminology are suitable, because that's a course that is taught. But this ain't no book on Criminology, not in it's current form.

===Legal issues re: Wikibooks===
When talking about books of this nature, I'm wondering if a general policy about not allowing books which advocate breaking laws or setting up scams might not be a good idea.  For example, a Wikibook &quot;How to not pay taxes&quot; might not be seen under a good light by the IRS (or other taxation authorities) if it talks about how to launder money and litterally get away without paying any taxes through other than legal means (like a normal tax deduction discussion, which would be perfectly fine.)  &quot;How to launder money&quot; would be a little more of a concrete example, or &quot;How to kill somebody&quot; or worse &quot;How to kill the President of the USA&quot; which would invoke some special laws in the USA and perhaps get Wikibooks or even all of Wikimedia shut down.  Similarly anything like [http://www.universityofnigeria.com/ the University of Nigeria] (a great parody site, BTW) might also be discouraged.  Political revolution advocacy might also be a reason to remove a wikibook.

The tricky thing with a policy of this nature is that things which are legal in once country might be illegal in another.  I think there are some laws which are generally universal (you shouldn't kill anybody, even if you don't particularly like them, and that theft is generally wrong in most cases) and these would be a no-brainer.  A good example of something perfectly acceptable in the USA but not in Germany would be most discussions about the Nazi Party, especially if you are advocating the recreation of that party.  NPOV issues would make most of that unacceptable anyway on Wikibooks, but anything having to do with Nazism would have to be under much tighter than normal scruitiny.

We certainly don't want Wikibooks to turn into something like Palidin Press.  While I may have a political opinion to support groups that publish such information, they are also sticking their necks out politically in a manner that if done here on Wikibooks might jeapordize the rest of this project.  I'm not even sure if Wikicities even wants to have Wikibooks like these either, which is perhaps something to ask Jimbo or Angela.  I don't know of a place to put content like this, but if some brave soul wants to set up their own Wiki and host content like this, that is their privilege.  I just don't think it should be hosted here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:06, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

==A Wikibooks Policy==

What is or isn't a wikibook? This section is for this deeper question.

[[User:Aya|Aya]] said:
:''I'm fine with that, but how can we word such a policy in a way which is not open to too much interpretation. If it's not worded well, future users will just spend too much time arguing about what is and isn't acceptable. This is why I suggested the fiction/non-fiction distinction, since (I hope) everybody knows the difference. Basically, if it's a book which gets a Dewey code, it's non-fiction.''

I think fiction/non-fiction is too coarsely grained. So, here's a possible policy:
:A Wikibook is an instructional resource that could ''conceivably,'' once it reaches [[Image:100%.png]], be used as the primary text for or a secondary text for some course, wether it be K-12, College, Graduate School, Adult Education, or Vocational Training. A course is anything that you could reasonably expect a city to offer a course on, in which the person enrolled in the course is considered a student. Thus, Yoga, Martial arts, Auto repair, and Computer setup would all be included. Excluded would be projects better-suited for an already existing WikiMedia project.
This is just a first shot attempt, but there it is.

I think the &quot;no original research&quot; needs to be better defined. For example, suppose someone wrote an entire video game, put up the source under GPL or public domain, and then wrote a book discussing how the game was written, and lent an expository view of the techniques and principles used to build the game. That would be a great instructional resource, even though the capter on &quot;how the dragon AI works&quot; might be &quot;original.&quot; So long as the book is instructive, it could be a valuable asset to have. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:28, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

Other ideas to consider:
* '''Direction''': If a book doesn't appear to be &quot;about&quot; anything in particular, then there's no chance a distributed group of collaborators could turn it into a completed product. A book has no direction if the topic is too broad. Example: a module on &quot;Humans&quot; is too broad to turn into anything useful.
* '''Page minimums''': If all that can be expected to be said about the topic is not at least 16 pages, then the book should either be merged with other books, or expanded with specific directions. A table of contents (or any other form of outline) with concrete suggestions could show that the book won't suffer from being too specific. Example: a module on how to do inductive proofs is not a book. But a module on discrete mathematics is.
* '''Any Ten Big Cities''': If in any of the 10 big cities in America (or, the country of concern) you can take a class in the topic as a student, then it's an instructional guide. Example: &quot;How to repair your car&quot; would count. &quot;How to play minesweeper like a pro&quot; would not.
* '''Any Public School''': If any public school, college, or univeristy teaches the subject as a for-credit course, then a book on that topic would be a wikibook. That would include how to program video games, but would not include how to play them.
These, again, are first stab attempts to define what a textbook really is.  Just like how a book needs to be not overly broad or overly specific, so must not our policies be. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:06, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

And where these ideas are leading is that eventually (after the inappropriate but actively-worked-on books are moved to wikicities) we'll start a timer. When the timer expires, we'll move all books that appear to be abandonded into a special abandoned section. Then, we can see what books are still alive, and be sure each is on a bookshelf, and that each bookshelf is available within two clicks from the main page. We still need to acknowledge stubs, but the main cure for stubs is to get people to keep on writing. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:26, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

::'''comment''' - I'm hesitant to go about defining what wikibooks as whole is or is not. We have a substantial number of books and a substantial number of present and former contributors who have added to books that might be nixed by this policy. Though this is a community, we do not control the project as a whole, the hardware, software, etc. Thus, I think it would be appropriate for any large scale redefinition of what wikibooks is or is not to come from wikimedia. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:29, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

:::Actually, Kellen, it's more like the other way around. There was a huge mess with Getting a Girl, and we somewhat postponed the &quot;what is a wikibook&quot; discussion for later. I believe that Jimbo wanted to give us the guidance that Getting a Girl was inappropriate, but didn't want to dictate policy for us. Indeed, Jimbo said he'd rather see the WB community decide standards. We can't keep passing the buck. It stops here, and now is the time to do this... we can take our time in doing so, but this issue must be addressed.&lt;p&gt;As for &quot;nixing&quot; books we obviously won't just delete good material: we'll be sure it has a home in some wikicity. The game guides in particular should be happy there. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:30, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

::::Yes, he expressed some desire to have the community set its policies, but what seems to be happening at least on this page is you and Aya bouncing back and forth with little visibility. If this is leading to a site-wide discussion I think that might be ok, but I expect it will be very contentous and difficult. Involving the &quot;higher authority&quot; may make things much easier. I'd also like to point out that Jimbo said: &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #DDEEFF;&quot;&gt;&quot;I certainly agree that a textbook about relationships is a perfectly valid topic for us.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; which I think would currently fall '''outside''' the realms of what you are proposing. Thus I believe there is at least some ambiguity from above as to what the purpose of WB actually ''is''. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:52, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
::::That said, I do agree that creating a definition of WB that is more specified would be a positive move as it would allow us to more clearly deal with VfD's/Transwikis through written policy. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:56, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
:::::Note that my proposals are exactly that, my proposals. I in no way expect to get it &quot;right&quot; the first time around. But there indeed are courses in sociology about relationships. But I don't think we'd ever want to see simply anecdotal stories about alpha males, except perhaps in a chapter on character development for a playwriting textbook.

=== Follow the example of Wikijunior? ===

Another thought I had last night is to follow the example of Wikijunior, and specify which books we do want, by name, and disallow any others. This would certainly help prevent internal forking (i.e. we wouldn't allow both of &quot;A History of Music&quot; and &quot;Music History&quot;).

Perhaps just one book per course:

* The important two
** [[English]]
** [[Mathematics]]
* The sciences
** [[Physics]]
** [[Chemistry]]
** [[Biology]]
* Languages
** &lt;s&gt;[[French]]&lt;/s&gt;
** [[German]]
** &lt;s&gt;[[Italian]]&lt;/s&gt;
** [[Japanese]], [[Hindi]], [[Russian]], [[Arabic]], [[Written Chinese]], [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Wu Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Portuguese]], [[Korean]], [[Bengali]] [[User:24.170.177.130|24.170.177.130]] 01:33, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
** [[Spanish]]
etc.

...then merge all the other books into those. Anything which doesn't fit (like guides to computer games) would go to a Wikicity. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:56, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
*This follows my idea (and I am thinking out loud here, and I am pleased with the discussion) that books need direction. That is, they need to be &quot;about&quot; something, that the something is well understood by several experts in the area, and other contributors can assist taking it to that goal. Perhaps anything where there is a multi-week course offered on the topic it counts as something instructional. Thus, allowing all courses taught in K-12, universities and continuing education, but discarding the single-day &quot;get rich in real estate, NOW&quot; huckstering kind of &quot;courses&quot;. But there are some &quot;obscure&quot; and advanced topics that we wouldn't think of to create placeholders. For example, The Semantics of Lambda Calculus, though there are a dozen books on that topic, and courses taught in it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:40, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
**Writing coursebooks is just ''one'' of the things done here at Wikibooks, it is not the only thing, nor should it be. This exceedingly blinkered and academic-centric idea would have Wikibooks throwing out [[Beekeeping]], one of the best books in the entire project! [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:35:21, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
**Follow-up: For each topic we could also have a spare book titled something like &quot;Topics in X&quot; or &quot;Advanced Topics in X&quot;. Thus, if someone wants to add something to the music history book, but it doesn't actually fit, it could instead go into the &quot;Topics in Music&quot; book. Such a &quot;topics&quot; kind of book wouldn't have the direction we'd require out of other books, but could serve to keep the other books cleaner. Topics books could be more encyclopedia in nature, without any linear ordering. The hope is that, by having special books without linear orderings, that would shape-up the other books so that they wouldn't degenerate into topics books themselves. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 21:42, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
***Such a prescriptive design may fit for coursebooks.  It does ''not'' fit with the ''rest'' of Wikibooks at all.  Allowing books to grow organically is best.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:35:21, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
*No.  Very bad.  Wikibooks is not just for subjects taught in schools.  Manuals for equipment and books on playing games (computer or otherwise) are perfectly valid for Wikibooks, and have a long history here.  This narrowminded idea would have Wikibooks throwing out [[Chess]].  Policies that are aimed at excluding vast swathes of existing content that has been here for a long time are exceedingly bad ideas.  [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:35:21, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
*I'd like to start by saying Wikijunior essentially has no policy, although there certainly is a perception that there may be one.  The current &quot;policy&quot; about starting new books in Wikijunior is completely untested as not even a single book has been through the process of going through a proposal, although I've certainly made a reasonable stab at it.  I wrote this policy because I felt the previous &quot;policy&quot; was absolutely stupid:  ''We won't allow anybody for any reason to add any new book, whether it is useful or not.  If you don't like the three books we chose to launch this project, that is too bad and you can take your marbles elsewhere.  Try Wikibooks, for instance.''  ;)&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this may be an interesting &quot;experiment&quot; to try out here on Wikibooks.  This is a '''major''' policy change, so it would be something that would be worthwhile to get a very large group of opinions from ordinary users here on Wikibooks, with a formal &quot;vote&quot; to see if we need to even go this route and a very large bold announcement on the front page of Wikibooks suggesting this is a major policy change that will affect how things are done here.&lt;p&gt;The thing I like about the general &quot;philosophy&quot; of Wikijunior is that it is a slow growth approach that encourages existing content to be completed first before you move on to doing other projects.  You are encouraged to  try and participate in adding to the current books first in order to &quot;get your feet wet&quot; before you tackle something like a whole new book.  In a way, each Wikibook represents a major project...akin to a Wikiproject on Wikipedia.  I think for many reasons we ought to treat Wikibooks in a very similar fashion, and try to encourage people to think about Wikibooks in that manner...particularly people that are coming over to Wikibooks from Wikipedia.&lt;p&gt;Another thing I love about this proposal is that it removes &quot;Wikipedia&quot;-like articles almost completely from Wikibooks, at least for initial book stubs.  That may still happen within a book project, and Macropedia issues are still going to be debated, but at least there would be a place to put them and each seperate book project could create its own set of guidelines within the small group of &quot;authors&quot; that are participating.  By creating a &quot;new Wikibook&quot; forum for people who want to start a new Wikibook, the &quot;spur of the moment Wikibooks&quot; (like the recently created and I see deleted Klingon-langauge Wikibook) would be stopped and at least a little bit of a vetting process would occur, including potentially gathering interest in starting a new Wikibook.  Inappropriate content could be culled or redirected even before it gets started, while the current policy is &quot;place it on Wikibooks and if we don't like it we'll delete it and throw it onto a trash heap.&quot;  I don't think that is too friendly to new users.&lt;p&gt;It also removes the &quot;worry&quot; about Wikipedia using Wikibooks as a dumping ground, as new Wikibooks would have to be proposed and vetted here on Wikibooks before the new book gets started.  I think a proposal like this would help to define the relationship of Wikibooks to the rest of the Wikimedia projects.  The New Project Proposal policy on Meta is a joke at the moment, and I've spilled a lot of (virtual) ink on the subject, but if done here on Wikibooks I think it would have a much more positive impact.  Creating a new Wikibook really isn't that big of a deal, and brand-new contributors to Wikibooks should certainly be encouraged to start one.  All we are suggesting here is perhaps the best way to start a Wikibook may not be to drop it on a bookshelf and start entering content.  I think the process can be improved regardless.&lt;p&gt;P.S.  I think this whole discussion in this section perhaps should be moved to a general policy discussion page than something on &quot;The Manual of Crime&quot;.  A vetting process like discussed above certainly would have helped to commit Wikibooks to keeping this Wikibook and avoided the whole VfD discussion in the first place.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:13, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
**Your conception of &quot;Wikipedia using Wikibooks as a dumping ground&quot;, repeated ad nauseam, is an entirely false one, and is simple parochialism.  Any editor who had actually ''looked'' at what comes through from Wikipedia would form the opposite conclusion.  Almost all of the content that comes from Wikipedia is useful and appropriate.  It does not come here arbitrarily.  Editors are making good use of Wikibooks, linking Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and Wikisource together to form coherent wholes.  Wikibooks is ''already'' defined to the rest of the Wikimedia projects, with guidelines both on Wikisource and on Wikipedia showing some of the relationships between the two and how the projects can be &amp;mdash; and have been &amp;mdash; used in combination to good effect. Your various arguments that use as a premise this false picture that you paint are thus fundamentally flawed. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 10:35:21, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
::*I say that Wikipedia uses Wikibooks as a dumping ground because I've seen it.  Until I started to raise a stink about it at Meta (and Foundation-l) and rewrote some &quot;policy&quot; statements there on Meta as well it seemed as though every other new project proposal had a statement of the effect &quot;try this on Wikibooks first&quot;.  Wikiversity and Wikijunior are very classic examples of this attitude, and it is very apparent that Wikibooks is not to be the incubator for new general projects that are not book-based in nature.  As far as Wikipedia is concerned in general, yes, there are a great many people at Wikipedia that do have a clue about everything that is going on, but there are so many editors at Wikipedia that IMHO Wikibooks can get overwhelmed very quickly if even a &quot;typical&quot; sized Wikiproject group decides to come over at once and push for new policy changes and other issues.  I also claim the right to refuse content from Wikipedia if editors there don't want it either, and feel that Wikibooks does not '''have to take''' content from Wikipedia just because some people at Wikipedia feel it should be here.  That there may be some merit to having it at Wikibooks is true, but there needs to be editorial independence between the two projects.  Policies on Wikipedia do not have to be implemented on Wikibooks, for many reasons.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:14, 20 August 2005 (UTC)
****I think that by moving lots of Wikibooks  to Wikicities then we're gonna piss off a helluva a lot of people, who might not come back...so perhaps being quite as restrictive as Aya's proposal might not serve long-term good...and also, there are no ''a priori'' reasons why English is important, and something else (like computer games, or relationships etc) isn't. On the other hand, some Wikibooks are quite absurd and will never develop into anything remotely like instructional resources. So what if we had a major drive for mergers, restructuring etc...to clean up....and then had a vetting procedure from then on? But I agree in principle to Aya's proposal that we should have I suppose an idea of larger books encompassing more. This would allow for far easier &quot;teaching&quot; from these books and also it would be so much easier to avoid duplication. A smaller amount of books might also help collaboration.

I like the project proposal idea. For wikicities, for example, you just can't create a server name and start going... it has to be something that a reasonable number of people would be interested in. What I like most about the Getting A Book Proposed First idea is that it shows what an undertaking a book project is. Many people start by thinking &quot;well, let me start typing up what I know on the weekend, and by Monday I'll be done.&quot; And then the book gets abandoned, because the topic itself was so insular no one else knows how to continue writing it. Perhaps books that would get an automatic approval would be anything taught at a fairly broad definition of educational institutions; it's the books that have no corresponding academic, hobby or trade course that would need to go through an approval process.&lt;p&gt;Now, just to be clear, my proposals here are just ideas being put out. In no way do I want to see the Chess book go. I think the Chess book is perfect for wikibooks. (It just so happens that you can take courses in chess and be a chess student, but maybe some of you don't see it that way.) As for Beekeeping I'll put my personal opinions aside and say that that's a legitimate vocation, so it could very well be a primary or secondary text of a trade course.

==Jimbo's recommendation on Wikibooks policy==
Here's the text of what I asked Jimbo about this all, and his reply. Only the links have been edited:
&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid gray; background-color: #EEEEEE;&quot;&gt;
Hi Jimbo, I wanted to point you to [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/The_Manual_of_Crime|Votes for deletion/The Manual of Crime]]. The book in question is similar to [[w:The Anarchist Cookbook|The Anarchist Cookbook]] in nature. Reading over the Wikicities policy, it seems like this book would not be allowed. So, it would seem to me that Wikibooks should at least have standards no lower than Wikicities. (In fact, the standards should be higher in the sense that no original research should be allowed.)

The discussion itself has turned somewhat into a discussion of where Wikibooks should draw the line. I think we all agree that textbooks, how-tos, and the cookbook have a place on Wikibooks; though there is no agrement whether video game walk-throughs should be included, or, indeed, the more significant point if there should be single books devoted to breaking laws. I don't think any of us have problems with chemistry books, in the proper context, describing explosives; but I think this has gone too far. If you could shed any wisdom on this discussion it would be greatly appreciated. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 07:32, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

The purpose of Wikibooks is to host works which constitute a curriculum of textbooks from Kindergarten through the university level.  The cookbook, for example, qualifies, since such courses are taught.  The manual of crime does not fit the definition of any course that I know of, and should be deleted.  This is not a decree, since I haven't even looked at it, just a recommendation for now.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 14:19, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

== Moved comments from main VfD Page ==

'''''Note:''''' This page was created to help keep stuff from filling up the main VfD page, and instead this huge discussion ensued.  I'm not trying to kill the discussion, but it was leaking on the main VfD page and the comments really should be kept here.

:Visit [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/The Manual of Crime#Jimbo's recommendation on Wikibooks policy|the section of the page with Jimbo's comment]]. I asked him on his wikipedia page for guidance, and it looks like this book should be on its way out. Perhaps Geo (or someone else) could move it to his user page for a couple of weeks, so that people interested in serving it on their own wikis can get a copy. (Because it won't be on any WikiMedia or Wikia site.)&lt;p&gt;I believe it's in the best interest of the project if we follow up on the other consequences of such a policy, including transwiki'ing the game walkthroughs over to the revenue-generating wikicities. (As I said before, the walkthroughs are so popular, it would be a shame to &quot;leave money on the table&quot; like that by not getting AdWords revenue. Further, I think transwiki'ing the high-quality walkthroughs will help legitimize wikicities as an exciting site to go to.)&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I think now we can have a much better idea of the scope of wikibooks. I think most of the favorite books will have no problem remaining here, though this does make it harder to justify the jokebook. I think after we get over this final hurdle, this entire VfD process will be fairer, more consistent, and less of a struggle. Fiat lux. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:22, 28 August 2005 (UTC)
::Hm, I was thinking of asking Jimbo myself but didn't like to bother him. But I'm glad you did. I agree with all of this. I've already organised a new home at the Gameinfo Wikicity and started a ''[[wikicities:c:gameinfo:Guide:Grand Theft Auto III|Grand Theft Auto III]]'' guide as a way of testing the water in advance, and it's already had a good amount of interest considering the game's age. With newer things like ''San Andreas'', ''The Wind Waker'', etc. moved over, I'd say there will certainly be more interest in this wikicity and wikicities in general. And more money...
::However I do think we need to have a site-wide vote on the game guides. Not everyone sees Jimbo as &quot;God&quot; on all issues. :)
::As for the books that don't probably fit, I think we need to set up some sort of voting system or administerial board to decide whether content stays or moves. For example [[Monopoly]] doesn't fall within this new limit, but does [[Chess]]? And [[Poker]]? And so forth and so on.

:::The next order of business should be to update our exclusions and inclusions list. And I agree with the wikicities policy of not having hacking/cracking materials either; we should include the WC policy as a subset of our own. I think the games will be tough. Chess seems to fit, because it is something that is actually taught, with real apprenticeships. Poker and Monopoly are harder... some of it could fit in with game theory (poker) and economics (monopoly). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:36, 29 August 2005 (UTC)
:::Yes, the Google-based rules are a good place to start but we need to clarify them more. For example I'd welcome a book about NESHLA, and if that included step-by-step instructions to making a ''Super Mario 3'' ROM hack in order to better teach the language then so be it, so long as the guide itself doesn't provide any form of ROM links. However I would be opposed to a guide aimed at hacking NoCDs because they have no legal uses whatsoever, thus resulting in a textbook that would never be taught. The Google rules are a catch-all, which we don't really want to become. So whatever illegal-content grounds we cover, we must be sure to allow certain acceptable uses of potentially-copyrighted materials.

::::Indeed, another standard must be to ask what is OK in the US. Looking at some of the VfD dicussion on this issue I'm a bit disheartened that some think it's somehow wise or responsible to not care about US law. Moreover, the content we choose to have on this particular site (because we have no authority to dictate any other site) is a completely separate discussion than what is allowed on the internet at large.&lt;p&gt;Thinking about board games some more it occured to me that maybe we could allow games that have legitimate, international competitions. That certainly includes Monopoly and Poker, but would exclude less popular board games (or the popular board games that are just purely chance). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:27, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

'''keep''', or at most edit/comment. Crime already  exist, and I think that is ok a book that describes it. Some parts may be edited and written in a more detached way.


==In the Event of Deletion==

Given Jimbo's comments on the matter, it would appear that the deletion or substantial reduction of the MoC is very likely. However, I beleive that this book contains too much valid content to delete outright. Several of the pages, such as the fighting page, could become (with some minor changes) seperate (and presumably acceptable) wikibooks. The recipes in the explosives section could be moved to the chemical synthesis wikibook, and much of the other content should be preserved at least for a period so that it can be cannibalized for other wikibooks. Additionally, finding hosting on another site for the book is another option. All of these possibilities would be eliminated were the book to be simply deleted. Therefore, I think that if the decision is made to delete this book, then the actual deletion should be postponed for a period of time to allow us to figure out what to do with all of the content. If you have any ideas, comments, suggestions, or opinions, please share them. Additionally, I keep a relatively current copy of the wiki code for the pages on my computer in .txt form. If anyone wants it without copying and pasting from each individual page, I can e-mail it to you. --[[User:Esoterica|Esoterica]] 00:52, 2 September 2005 (UTC)
:That's close to what I've been thinking. I think an admin like Geo should keep a copy of it under his user pages.&lt;p&gt;Note that incorporating pieces into other books will be subject to approval of those books' authors. For example, the chemistry writers might not necessarily want the explosives sections, even in modified forms. When we solidify our policy I think it's also likely anything in the future advocating breaking the law will be subject to speedy deletion. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:35, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

:I cannot think of a reasonable objection to the addition of properly worded guides for the synthesis of certain explosive chemicals, under laboratory conditions, to the Chemical Synthesis wikibook. There already exist pages on that wikibook which detail the creation of chemicals which can explode. Additionally, I was unaware that the authors of a book had any special decision-making powers. --[[User:Esoterica|Esoterica]] 23:30, 6 September 2005 (UTC)
::In the interest of an open discussion here are some reasonable objections: Some may not want to be associated with a project related to bomb making. Others might not think of it as important enough information to share and believe that wikibooks should maintain a more academic presence. Others might believe it to be immoral to even include such information. Still others might say including such content will hurt our fund raising capabilities. I would assume you wouldn't agree with any of these objections, but they are reasonable.&lt;p&gt;I think you can make a case that this information should be available ''somewhere'', but it's a much harder case to make that this information needs to be available ''here at wikibooks''. Again, we aren't the Internets. We're just a little sliver of it. Most arguments along the lines of spreading information or speech-for-the-sake-of-speech (even only in the cases when it is properly worded) fail to explain why wikibooks must play that role. (Indeed, if it was such an important role, the argument maker should spend their own resources to distribute it. And if they don't wish to, that should tell you something.)&lt;p&gt;Largely I think it would be ok for a standard chemistry book to explain some explosive reactions: certain material that any chemist must know probably must include that discussion. But there is a tremendous difference between teaching the principles of chemistry and merely showing the procedures to make explosives. Wikibooks cannot and will not ever become a handbook for terrorists.&lt;p&gt;Also, it's very natural for the authors of a book to decide the content. Partially it's through building consensus and respecting decisions made by those who provide the most helpful content (we want such helpful people to ''keep'' on writing, after all, instead of being discouraged and leaving the project). Another aspect of it is that books need direction and guidance. If books just picked up any information that anyone fancied they would be scattered, hard to read, hard to understand and completely useless. Sometimes it's the case that even useful, well-written, non-violent, socially responsible text will get cut. For example, a calculus book shouldn't be cluttered with the very important, interesting, graduate-level constructions of axiomatic set theory. Such material should be put in its own set theory book instead, and the calculus book should only contain the set theory it actually needs to instruct about calculus.

:: I suppose ultimately the answer to this issue lies in the definition of what Wikibooks is. As there is no set, easy definition (or perhaps there are too many), there is some confusion about this. The other disagreements center around formatting, tone, and wording, and are easily solved once the overarching issue is resolved. What wikibooks needs is a new definition under which the status of a work like the MoC is clear. As such, the debate on this page is largely inconsequential, if the decision is made to exclude or include the MoC in the definition of a Wikibook, no consensus on this page will change the fate of the book. Therefore, there needs to be some form of decision made concerning wikibooks policy. I do not know what the policy for these changes is, but it needs to happen so that this book can be eliminated or allowed to grow. I presume that the VFD pages are not the proper forum for such a debate. --[[User:Esoterica|Esoterica]] 04:39, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
:::You've actually identified the case exactly. It has already been decided that books like MoC will not be permitted and this book indeed will be deleted. We are in the process right now of deciding what else is or isn't appropriate for a WikiBook. It's a long process, because we've discovered that what sound like good rules end up being inadequate. It's iterative.&lt;p&gt;It is my hopes (personally) that WikiBooks can get over some of the anti-elitism of the Wikipedia and be more of an academic project, as opposed to a free-speech-for-all project. In my opinion, we sorely need free textbook resources, while we already have a free-speech-for-all resource anyway: it's called the internet. The closer to the dark areas WikiBooks goes the less value it will have in the very communities we need to be writing books. A visit to the list of recent changes will show you most of us are either working on something very academic or technical, or we're working on a video game guide. The game guides might or might not move over to Wikicities (which itself is an exciting project). But given what the recent changes list is, it's pretty clear to me that the dark areas are a niche interest at best. Yet, they carry high costs for everyone else (namely, bad associations, more schools blocking the site, less academic interest, more opportunities for media ridicule, lower moral standards, and a system that attracts the very problematic entry of MoC that has caused this whole discussion in the first place, which since has been deleted). WikiBooks will still welcome controversy: academics itself, and its love of knowledge, always leads to controversy. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:03, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:: You have mentioned that the decision has already been made. Where has it been made and by whom? Is there a way for me to see a record of the discourse? I am asking out of curiosity. Also, given that definition of wikibooks, I agree that the MoC is an innapropriate project. --[[User:Esoterica|Esoterica]] 01:04, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
:::The way I see it Jimbo is giving us very good guidance, but we feel like we need to create a concrete policy first, so as to be fair to future contributors (so that they won't find out later that their work was in appropriate for the project). It was started on this page and is now in a preliminary voting process at [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote]] (the talk page for that link has all of the action; we're still trying to decide what to vote on). I encourage you to look at the page and the discussion and for you to provide feedback. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:32, 8 September 2005 (UTC)


:: Having looked at the page, I see no decision to delete this wikibook, or any consensus on a definition of Wikibooks which would exclude the MoC. --[[User:Esoterica|Esoterica]] 02:47, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
:::For the decision look to both Jimbo's message on his wikipedia page (linked to from here) and every administrator's reaction to it. Jimbo's message is not fiat (because he hasn't even looked at the book) but he knows more than anyone else who is here what wikibooks is. The vote is essentially to find ''the general rule that explains'' why MoC will be excluded. That is, either through reasons because it is not a legitimate course, or because it is a violation of wikicities policies, or because you would not find it in your school library, et cetera. Anyway, to make the story short, we're still trying to decide what is or isn't a wikibook. For example, I feel that books on hobbies should be allowed, but not game walkthroughs. However, I'm finding it very hard to find the rule that would differentiate game playing with hobbies like chess. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:04, 8 September 2005 (UTC)


== Manifest or Explicit Motive behind a Wikibook ==

Along with the other valuable criteria that have been discussed in order to determine what material is adequate in wikibooks, I'd like to contribute a couple.

We should consider the '''MANIFEST MOTIVE''' behind a book, not the valuable insight that could come from analysis or  &quot;''metareading''&quot; [i.e. reading a book not to follow it's content (a manual or textbook) or the intent of the author (e.g. a work of fiction, meant to be read for pleasure) but to analyse it and understand the what-why-how-etc of it being written, this is, to understand the motive and extract metainformation]. For example, it's quite valuable (in fact, it's very important) to read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in order to understand why Hitler wrote it, what went on inside his head, the origins of his ideas, etc. But &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; is not valuable for its manifest motive. In fact, it is detestable. Those who follow it as a textbook are detestable as well.

What would happen if someone posted a &quot;Manual of Ethnic Cleansing&quot; on Wikibooks? We would have the same problem that with the &quot;manual of crime&quot;. But here's the thing: we shouldn't pay that much atention to the possible benefits of analysing such a book to understand ethnic cleansing, its mechanisms, and the workings of the mind of the author or the people who would use such a manual. Don't &quot;metaread&quot;, because the wikibooks are meant to be read, not &quot;metaread&quot; That's not what wikibooks is for. Instead look at the manifest motive of the book. In this case, the manifest motive would be to teach how to massacre people according to their ethnic group in an efficient, industrial way. Forget about the value of metainformation such as &quot;We could learn how this maniacs develop ther methods&quot; or &quot;let's study how this psico's mind works, how the author sees people as mere objects to be gotten rid of&quot;. Since &quot;how to commit genocide&quot; is not a valid manifest motive for a wikibook, it should be deleted.

:With a different title, &quot;how to commit genocide&quot; would be an unsurprising part of the curriculim in some parts of the world. Wikibooks isn't limited to the USA, is it? [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:45, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

The same thing happens with &quot;The manual of crime&quot;. There could be valuable metainformation about the crimes, the mind of the author, how criminals act, the probability that this text was written by some morbid enthusiast of crime who has never commited a serious crime because first he would have to move out of his mother's basement, etc; but a Wikibook is meant to be '''READ''', not ''metaread'', analised for metainformation, or something like that. Valuable information in a Wikibook should be '''EXPLICIT''', not hidden behind a manifest motive such as to teach people how to hurt, rob, rape or destroy someones life in assorted ways. It doesn't matter that this &quot;manual&quot; is laughable, or that the &quot;criminal&quot; (read: teen spaz) will likely get him/herself hurt/arrested/killed instead of succesfully doing anything that this text mentions: all the more reasons to delete it. Even if there could be valuable information implicit, located through an analysis and interpretation of the text, (I mean, even &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; is valuable from a historical and psichological standpoint) since it's '''MANIFEST MOTIVE''' does not conform to something that could remotably be legitimately taught in some kind of legitimate educational facility, then the choice is easy: '''Deletion'''.

That wikibook about cheating in exams should be deleted as well, i believe. The metainformation that somenone could use to catch cheaters or avoid cheating in his/her classroom (a teacher) is interesting, but it's not a book about cheating as a problem in school and/or defeating cheating methods; its manifest motive is teaching how to cheat. I'm not saying the information should be lost, or that it is not useful in some way; it just doesn't belong in wikibooks.[[User:200.40.105.227|200.40.105.227]] 09:36, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

:You might be interested to read [[Wikibooks_talk:Policy/Vote#A_directly_enumerated_WikiBooks_policy]] which is an attempt at wording precisely what is appropriate and not. Please do comment if you find any opportunities for better wordings, find questionable boundaries, or have questions/disagrements. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:58, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

:Yah, but who decides what the '''MANIFEST MOTIVE''' is? &quot;Meta-reading&quot;? What? Wikibooks already has the VFD process to determine what should be deleted. This suggestion sounds like it would make things ''more'' complicated, not less. Unless the author(s) can be questioned directly, any analyses of their &quot;'''MOTIVE'''&quot;s is mere conjecture. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 19:54, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

'''Deletion. Now!''' [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Kolossos kolossos]][[User:80.185.19.96|80.185.19.96]] 16:43, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

I agree, '''Deletion. Now!'''--[[User:152.163.100.5|152.163.100.5]] 15:10, 26 September 2005 (UTC).

you folks seem to be relying on jimbo's assertion that the subject matter of the book isn't taught in any organised courses, but what about, say, criminology, or, say, &quot;police academy&quot;?  surely such matter is taught there.  [[User:24.146.21.169|24.146.21.169]] 09:05, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

Frankly, the section on explosives gives some interesting information on chemical synthisis.

== Translation ==

Is there a copy of the book in its last version? If there is one I would like to translate it and transfer it to the German Wikibooks, so the content will be conserved. If you own a copy, please contact moc.20.scaramanga@spamgourmet.com . Thanks!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humanity - our species Homo Sapiens Sapiens - emerged about 3 million years ago. What distinguishes us from other species is our unique survival strategy (wisdom). Whilst all animals have brains with some memory and anticipation (emotions), we have imagination. We can project several imaginary futures based on our existing experience, and communicate and compare these ideas rationally. Truly &quot;In the beginning was the word....&quot;

Many millennia ago, humans faced many hazards, and conquered them with the knowledge they then possessed. Questions about the nature of threats in the natural world, of course, about what might happen after death were crucial, for human minds then (just as they do for us today) would have appeared to have an existence of their own, somehow separate and distinct from the body they inhabit. 

Wise leaders solved such abstract problems, and from the practices they suggested, improved the probability of survival for their followers. Successful habits became enforced, and so people built religious institutions to develop and exploit the social benefits of civilisation over open warfare. 

Vital to that persuasion and pacification is the threat of lethal force, and so warriors then as soldiers now, have to believe that the good of their society depends on killing other people, and themselves risking death, for which heroism they will be rewarded - if not in this world, then in the next. 

As communal living tends to unify concepts and actions, enlarging clans and evolving tribes would have had to unify their beliefs about the unknown, if only to reduce internal conflict and standardize rituals and behavioural norms. Tribal trading and assimilations would periodically introduce new ideas, and undoubtedly these would have disturbed the status quo and created debate about the validity of existing practices, thoughts and even beliefs.

Now and again different kinds of leaders would appear and systematize practices. Military leaders would unify people and property. Philosophical leaders would unify facts and theories. Religious leaders would unify beliefs and dogmas. Successful leaders would attract followers, and these would help to consolidate and strengthen fiefdoms, as well as understandings and theologies, for such is the way societies are built.

This part of the book examines the critical role that leaders play in originating and developing religions. It explains the source of the inspirations that illuminate and empower leaders’ activities. Details about some of the world’s major religions are then provided; these serve to illustrate our religions’ diversity and to highlight some of the many benefits we derive from religions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Beliefs, and their accompanying religious practices, have influenced the thoughts, decisions and behaviours of humans for thousands of years. Stonehenge, rock sculptures, pyramids, temples, stone altars, tombs, churches, cathedrals—all attest to religion’s long history, but also demonstrate that our beliefs can and do change over time.

Religious beliefs and practices have influenced the development of all civilizations, all societies and all cultures; to varying degrees, they wend their way through and affect everyone’s thoughts and deeds&lt;ref&gt;Read Ruth Benedict, ''Patterns of Culture'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1934), for many insightful descriptions of how religions have influenced cultures, and how cultures have influenced people’s thoughts.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, clearly, our religious mind-sets must have had a beginning, and there would have been a time when thoughts of a god did not exist. Presumably there would also have been a time when no one knew “right” from “wrong.” This chapter discusses why and how early humans added such concepts to their thoughts and vocabulary. The central question being implicitly examined is, “are all of our many religions, beliefs and values, divine in origin—or could some, many, or even all, be man-made?”

      <text xml:space="preserve">No one knows just how religious beliefs and practices began, but Sara Blaffer Hardy suggests mutual childcare may have been important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hardy |isbn=9780674032996 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; since ''&quot;It only requires a couple to conceive a child, but a whole village to raise it to maturity&quot;.'' 

The emergence of  agriculture and the domestication of animals around seven thousand years ago i(n about the fifth millennium B.C.E) are generally acknowledged as the impetus for the emergence of the first large-scale, complex urban societies. These societies, which appeared almost simultaneously around 4000 B.C.E in both Egypt and Mesopotamia, used stone tools, but within 500 years stone tools and weapons gave way to bronze. With bronze manufacture came a revolution in warfare.&lt;ref name=USAFA&gt; [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/gabrmetz/gabr0002.htm USAF Air University: Origin of war]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with weapons, emerged military discipline, tactical skills and strategic planning, particularly relating to the optimization of available manpower by training, sanitation and the strict avoidance of those foods likely to cause digestive discomfort or  diarrhea. Religions tend to enforce absolute self-discipline by imposing the belief that unseen observers are monitoring our every thought and action in order to reward or punish us for all eternity after our demise, so that - but only for obedient believers - death need not be feared, and may even be welcomed for those 'fortunate enough' to killed 'heroically' in battle.

A plausible explanation for modern religious belief is that like all animals, actions and habits  that were effective in promoting survival and prosperity in the past have evolved  from previous  generations. The ideas and customs of men and women who have been successful would therefore similarly have been passed on to their offspring as 'truths'. Parents tend impose their beliefs as assumptions that serve inhibit questioning or experimentation which might prove be hazardous. 

Everyone makes thousands of minor assumptions every day, and normally these all transpire unnoticed. We get up, dress, eat, do chores, go to work, return home, prepare a meal, and so on, continuously making subconscious assumptions that determine the way we act. For example, we assume that other people will behave in much the same way as they always have—and they do. We assume that the bus will arrive, that stores and offices will open, that we still have a job to go to—and we are usually right. Any incorrect suppositions we might make are generally inconsequential, and corrections are easily, and mostly subconsciously, made.

We make assumptions because we can never know all there is to know about any facet of our lives, or about any object or event we encounter. Our true state of ignorance is seldom apparent to us, but our lack of knowledge makes itself known every time there is an important decision to be made, one whose consequences might seriously affect us, or the lives of those we love, for instance. On these occasions we quickly discover how little we really know. Anyone considering marriage or buying a house for the first time, for example, knows this feeling. At such times we may temporarily be unable to make a decision, for fear of the consequences were we to make a “wrong” choice. When such feeling arise, we spend much time gathering and evaluating information, trying all the time to replace assumptions with accurate knowledge. Thus, although we rarely notice that every decision we make has its fringe of assumptions, such is the case.&lt;ref&gt;Uncertainty is yet another consequence of the universe’s causality. Since causality necessitates everything being related or connected (directly or indirectly) to everything else, we can never know absolutely all there is to know about all things and all events. Consequently we can never know all there is to be known about even the tiniest object or action.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early humans would have faced exactly the same difficulty. They knew even less than we do about the true state of most affairs, and making assumptions would have been the only way they could have made decisions. And—just as happens to the assumptions we make—after a while many of the useful assumptions they made would have become indistinguishable from facts.

Since we humans are born of  into a society consisting of parents, grandparents and various experts, and that children tend to learn from wise elders, the assumption that there was some ancient, all-wise ancestor or progenitor of mankind is not unreasonable. Claiming some special relationship to this assumed omnipotent wisdom provided a powerful mechanism of social control which allows the sophisticated human organization required to develop ancient empires and modern civilization.For example, monarchs claiming divine intervention or inspiration delivering them victory  or a  'bridge' (pontiff in Roman times) whose inspiration is divine and thus infallible.  

It is a rather modern (Age of Enlightenment) idea that Oscar Wilde encapsulated: ''To Assume makes an ASS out of yoU and ME!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The earliest evidence yet discovered that our ancestors believed in some kind of life after death is to be found in graves of the Neandertals (who lived from about 200,000 to about 25,000 y.a.). Careful arrangement of the deceased, as well as accompanying flint implements together with broken animal bones (likely to have come from food buried with the body), suggest that these accoutrements were considered to be needed by the dead. (Neandertal cave artwork depicting burial rituals also supports the premise that they assumed a life after death.)

At least as early as 30,000 y.a., Cro-Magnon followed more complex rituals. They buried their dead in sewn clothing, covered them with ornaments and bead decorations, and surrounded them with tools, weapons and food.&lt;ref&gt;A well written description of some of the many fascinating beliefs and rituals humans have conceived can be read in ''Man’s Religions''. See John B. Noss, ''Man’s Religions'', 5th ed. (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; One grave, 28,000 years old, in Sungir, Russia, contains the body of a sixty year old man wearing bracelets and necklaces, and dressed in a tunic sewn with hundreds of mammoth-ivory beads; he was accompanied by rich grave goods.

For some as yet unknown reason, ornamenting the dead with red pigment has also been a long-lasting and widespread custom.&lt;ref&gt;Arrow-head-shaped sharpened stones, cutting knives, shaped piercing stones, and stores of red ochre have been found in South African coastal caves, in debris layers that are over 100,000 years old.&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of a young man some 25,000 years old, discovered in a cave in South Wales, was covered with red ochre and accompanied by a shell necklace, ivory beads and bracelets. Ornamentation continued until at least 6,500 y.a., for the head of one of seventeen Stone Age bodies (dated to that age and found in a cemetery at Bøgebakken, Denmark) was surrounded by red ochre. Burial customs such as these and others provide strong evidence that early man believed in the existence of some kind of afterlife, for which the body needed to be prepared and provisioned.

Burial rituals increased in complexity during the Neolithic Age (9,000–5,000 y.a.), to the extent of including animal sacrifices, cremation, entombment in stone chambers roofed with huge boulders and body preservation. The Chinchorro culture of northern Chile conducted extremely elaborate burial rituals, as is readily evidenced by mummified bodies dating back 9,000 years. The head, hands and feet were removed, the body was skinned and soft tissue excavated, and the skull was packed with a mixture of grass, hair and ashes. The skin was then reapplied, the whole body plastered with an ash paste and then painted black and red. It is inferred from this elaborate practice that some intense religious assumption (one that sooner or later may well have metamorphosed into a belief) must have prompted such effort.

A different form of evidence suggesting early ''Homo'' had the intellectual ability to invent assumptions is to be found in several now-European countries where Cro-Magnon left rock drawings and engravings in caves. These sketches illustrate their prowess in hunting large herds of animals (and the skeletons of hundreds of early horses found in sites frequented by Cro-Magnon show how successful these pursuits were). Such hunting strategies require abstract thought, organization and planning, and from this it is deduced that they had a language complex enough to be able to conduct a discussion of options and to manage assumptions.

Another item occasionally shown in cave drawings, and of significance to this discussion, is a figure in clothing associated with shamans or medicine men. These figures appear to have a significant role in the behaviours being depicted in the drawings. Shamans are traditionally involved in caring for the dead, and their thoughts and practices would certainly influence ideas held by clan members.

The accepted conclusion from this kind of evidence is that our ancestors assumed that an afterlife existed—that they actualized the concept of an afterlife thousands of years before the same notion was incorporated into the religions of early Egyptians and, later, into many of ours. This suggests that when describing “heaven” today we are not simply repainting a vision first drawn by prophets or theologians—we are actually maintaining or embroidering a Neandertal assumption. Of course, we don’t say that we are describing an assumption, but such is its origin. And our belief in an afterlife remains an assumption because there is no credible evidence that an afterlife actually exists, whether for the Neandertals, the Pharaohs, or for any modern-day human.&lt;ref&gt;If such an afterlife did exist, it must certainly be rather crowded by now, for where is the line drawn on admittance? (And what a temporally and culturally wide and interesting mix of inhabitants we would encounter!)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Man must have assumed thousands of years ago that the inexplicable behaviour of some or even many aspects of the world was due to the presence of powerful gods.&lt;ref&gt;See Noss, ''Man’s Religions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can understand why it was necessary to believe in gods. Prior centuries of rational thinking about practical matters (how best to take advantage of an animal’s behaviour when hunting, for example) had led naturally (if only subconsciously) to the realization that everything that happens has a cause. It was therefore only logical to conclude that something must cause such events as thunder and lightning to occur, or the sun to rise always in the east.

It was entirely rational for our ancestors to ask what could possibly give rise to such phenomena. But the true explanations lay far beyond their ability to comprehend all those thousands of years ago.

Written records tell us how the Greeks later solved this problem. They assumed that such events were caused by some kind of invisible beings who lived behind the clouds, occasionally amusing themselves by teasing or playing jokes upon those who lived on Earth below. Today, we might think that this was an extraordinary fantasy to dream up, but what, in ancient times, other than some supernatural beings, could explain the occurrence of such impressive events?

The hidden existence of powerful entities was not an unreasonable assumption for even very early humans to make. Living in caves and huts, they were low in nature’s hierarchy. There were many dangerous and more powerful animals lying in wait. Numerous awe-inspiring events took place daily that could not be explained. Mysterious illnesses and sudden inexplicable deaths occurred. Thunder filled the air for miles around, but lightning struck only certain spots seemingly randomly chosen. The sun, on the other hand, followed a routine—it moved across the sky in an orderly manner, regularly disappeared at night, only to rise again the next day. And eclipses—how could such rare incidences possibly be explained?

It was logical and sensible to assume that one or more mighty beings lived out of sight above, and that they contrived such events. This explanation so admirably solved many profound mysteries that, once put forward, it must have seemed the obvious answer and been immediately accepted. It seems certain that ''H. sapiens'' would have assumed gods existed almost as soon as they could form such a concept.

Moreover, in addition to being an explanation, this assumption had practical applications. It suggested ways men and women could act, if and when they needed to influence, praise or placate the behaviour of those who ruled from the skies above.

There is a great deal of evidence that magical rites with appeasement objectives were practised in many primitive societies. Early authorities, skilled in catering to capricious gods, devised and carried out often fanciful rituals. When the incantations and methods of these experts worked, when rain fell or eclipses ended, their reputation grew. When their best efforts were to no avail, someone or something else could easily be blamed.

The craft of such specialists continues today. Nearly all religions employ functionaries with similar roles, intermediaries who communicate the wishes of (and direct penitence to) a god. Their roles have remained roughly the same, but the communicants’ rituals and ceremonial customs have changed because, over time, humans have modified their beliefs about what is the “correct,” or “moral,” way to behave (for example, we no longer hold that human sacrifices are necessary).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assumptions can be indistinguishable from facts. A scientist might seek them out, but most of us would not. It would be impossible to sort one’s general knowledge into facts and assumptions, and we treat them as if they were identical. Both are accepted as being correct until proven wrong, used as long as they are useful, then forgotten when their utility is spent.

This is what has happened to early man’s assumptions that gods exist. Gods were taken for granted from at least as early as 5,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;See Noss, ''Man’s Religions''&lt;/ref&gt; Their behaviours were discussed, subtle differences noted and character variations identified. Each deity became distinct, recognizable, understandable, named and worshiped by a few or by many; some because they created a fear that had to be calmed, others because they were loved. Assumptions had become indistinguishable from beliefs.

This early belief in many gods is still visible in Hindu communities. Colourful images of gods are displayed all over India, beckoning as clearly today as they did thousands of years ago. These deities are venerated and consulted in much the same manner as monotheists behave toward their one god. Some modern Hindus state that the images seen should be considered reminders that the one true god exists in many forms; others do not feel the situation is this simple, preferring to believe in the existence of many deities, each possessing different powers. However, the nature of Hindu belief is not the issue here; the point to note is that most of humankind once believed in the existence of many gods. Our shift to predominantly believe in a single creator is a relatively recent happening.

The belief in several gods (several dozens of gods, in some societies) gave rise to complex theologies, with many stories chronicling the interactions of multifaceted god-personalities to be memorized and taught to the next generation. It would have been fairly obvious to anyone, anytime, that monotheism is a much simpler belief. One supreme god could replace much confusion. Over centuries past there must have been many intelligent visionaries who argued in favour of a single supreme being.

We know a lot about one such idealist—Amaenhotep IV, a family-oriented Pharaoh who was married to a powerful wife (Queen Nefertiti) and who ruled Egypt for seventeen years, 1300 years before Christ was born. Amaenhotep changed his name to Akhenatom&lt;ref&gt;Or “Pious to Atom” (see Noss, ''Man’s Religions'', 44-45). Also known as Akhenaton and Akenaten (meaning the God Aten—or Light—is satisfied) see Naguib Mahfouz and Najib Mahfuz, ''Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth'', translated by Tagreid Abu-Hassabo, (Doubleday and Company, 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; in support of monotheism, and ordered all to worship the one sun-god, Atom. This practice didn’t last long however; shortly after his death it was stopped by traditionalist priests who persuaded his successor (the boy-king Tutankhamen) to revert to polytheism.

Judaism was the first religion of modern significance to successfully institutionalize the belief that there is only one god. Christianity and Islam later adopted this concept, and have since conveyed their message to billions. Furthered by numerous persuasive practices (crusades, conquests, missionaries, inquisitions, torture, trials and burnings, to name a few), this lengthy battle for simplification (and influence over the minds of people) affected many over the centuries. Over time it remodelled nations, as they changed their laws to accommodate changes in beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;China and Japan as recently as the past century, but also Ancient Egypt and several other cultures long ago, further believed that members of the ruling family were Earthly representatives of their God. This, no doubt, added considerably to the family’s stature and power.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today (as noted in [[../../Present Day Religions/Some Major Religions|Some Major Religions]]) the majority of the world’s population take for granted the existence of one god. Most prefer not to consider this just an assumption, first conceived to account for any number of seemingly mysterious events, then employed to explain how the universe and life began. The assumption remains in vogue because it is useful; it authenticates the purpose many refer to (see [[../../Making Decisions/Moral Decisions|Moral Decisions]]) when making decisions about how to live their lives.&lt;ref&gt;The assumption or belief that a god created the universe does not, of itself, also mean that the universe (or anything within it) exists for a reason, or to meet some purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is entirely possible to believe that the initiating god lives or lived outside of time, or inhabits a universe completely detached from ours—thoughts not at all foreign to some of our religions, nor to some scientists. Such a creator could have fabricated our universe from either of these positions and long since forgotten that he (read He, She, It, or even a multi-faceted Entity for “he”) had done so. The originating god even may have decided long ago that he had nothing else to do, and ceased being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively, he could have been acting whimsically at the time, and be quite unconcerned subsequently about what is happening within his creation. (This is one way to resolve the concern of some regarding how a benevolent god could permit the existence of evil, but an unacceptable explanation to many, particularly those who, for reasons of their own, want a judgmental god.) Or, he may be just sitting back, not interfering, observing how events in this universe play out, prior to deciding how to create an improved one. In other words, once we assume the existence of a god, with absolutely no factual knowledge about such an entity, we can attribute to it any properties we wish. Anything can be claimed to be god’s will (as demonstrated by the innumerable, often incongruous, religious declarations sometimes proclaimed on television or the radio), and any action can be justified (as evidenced through statements made by some religious terrorists following their appalling actions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The whole idea of a god seem rather pointless when viewed in this manner; furthermore this perspective completely misses the concept’s major value: belief in a god-given purpose allows our minds to make moral decisions, and acting upon these decisions delivers meaning to our lives. Any other belief of equal or greater significance would do as much.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A belief in a god or gods is not a religion. Religions add visions of purpose, ideals, behavioural criteria, rewards, punishments, and much more, to their core belief. (In other words, religions weave and maintain aspects of their followers’ mental environments discussed in [[../../Solving Problems/Problem Environments|Problem Environments]].) Many of the most critical of these ideas stem from the religion’s founder. To understand how one person can conceive such notions then convince others that they are true, we must first discuss leadership.

Contrary to popular impression, leaders are plentiful in this world. Many lead for just a short time, but others retain their leadership quality for years.&lt;ref&gt;It is important not to confuse administration and leadership. Administrators simply follow policies, conventions, and rules. They are told what to do, either by these statements or by other people. (Political heads of state, for example, are often more administrators than leaders; many rule by listening to what the majority are saying before acting.) Leaders, almost by definition, do not heed rules or other’s instructions; they have their own internal guidance system and head where it dictates, fashioning the future as they proceed. Indeed, true leaders frequently feel that rules are made for others to follow, not them. (It might also be noted that leaders are invariably more creative than administrators—see [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]].)&lt;/ref&gt; Most guide only a family, a work group, or perhaps one friend, but some lead multitudes.

Social conditions elicit leaders—recall the French and Russian revolutions, India in the 1920s (and on), Germany in the 1930s, or South Africa more recently, for example. Individuals within, or emotionally close to, suffering communities feel driven to change conditions and metamorphose into leaders as they become captivated by powerful ideals.&lt;ref&gt;As monarchs generally live sheltered lives, few kings (or queens) have been leaders, although all possessed power enough to make their ideas bear fruit.&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership skills strengthen as these ideals are expressed. Think of Jesus, Muhammad, Ghandi, and Mandela, or Churchill, Hitler and Stalin. Each held fast to an imagined ideal of some kind, their view of how society should be, a future to strive for, a dream of a better world.

All leaders have a vision of an enhanced future. A vision is critical because this is what leaders lead toward—their own mental image of a superior state of affairs. These visions can develop slowly, as perhaps for Genghis Khan; or in a blinding flash, as perhaps for Joan of Arc; or in intermittent surges, as perhaps for many parents.

Religious leaders differ from others in one important aspect: they credit a Supreme Being with providing the insights they convey. Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Joan of Arc, and a multitude of saints and lesser religious leaders attributed the words they spoke to their God. Clearly they did so because they believed this to be true. But skeptics might be forgiven for thinking otherwise, reasoning that the vision expressed may have come from the visionary’s “conversion” or “revelation” (terms introduced in [[../../Making Decisions/Moral Decisions|Moral Decisions]] and further discussed in [[../../Revelations And Conversions/Reformations, Conversions And Revelations|Reformations, Conversions And Revelations]]), events that were possibly an outcome of their own desire to improve conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The need to improve conditions is just one of many psychological needs that influence individual’s thoughts and deeds. The need for power, the need to achieve, or the need to obtain or express love, are other well-known examples; any one or more of these may well have been the motivating factor that drove the cited individuals to behave as they did.&lt;/ref&gt;

Please note that I’m not suggesting that religious leaders or founders do not believe in a God. Almost certainly all do, and many also believe that their God sometimes speaks to, or through, them. What I am stating, however, is that believing that their visions and words come from God does not necessarily make it so. They believe them to be authentic—that is what makes them convincing leaders. Their ideas can be entirely false, but as long as they believe them to be true, the strength of their convictions can convince and convert others.

This raises an important issue. What creates these beliefs? What happens in the minds of religious leaders to convince them that they are God’s emissaries? The logical answers to these questions will be provided in the next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Experience has taught us that everything has a beginning, and this causes us to think that the universe, too, must once have begun.&lt;ref&gt;Unless we believe that the universe has always existed, or that it is only a figment of our imagination.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest origin-explanation was that it was created by a god, an interpretation based upon the assumption that such an entity exists.

This explanation has two great advantages over our modern understanding:&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../The Universe/]] for a synopsis of this.&lt;/ref&gt; it is simple, and it is easily understood. However, it also has two great disadvantages: it tells us nothing about the universe and it does not help us to understand cosmological behaviour. If we want to understand reality, then we must work from what we know rather than from what we assume.&lt;ref&gt;The importance of being rational in both science and religion is discussed in [[../../Rationality In Science And Religion/]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious founders and leaders rarely state why a god created the universe. But they always attribute purpose to our existence, and they always teach us to live in a manner that demonstrates we value attainment of this purpose. Living to attain this purpose, we are told, presents problems; these, just like all of our everyday problems, can only be solved by understanding the environment that holds the conditions to be met (as we saw in [[../../Solving Problems/Problem Environments|Problem Environments]]). This is why each religion’s environment is described and explained, and why their God’s criteria or commandments, the existence of a judgement day, heaven and hell, and so on, are detailed. In explaining such things, these leaders all (except, perhaps, a few) confidently believe that they are carrying out the instructions of a higher Being.

A belief in any purpose creates a mind that can make decisions with the clarity of vision and the certainty of conviction. A strong belief in any leader’s vision creates an ardent proselyte. However, belief only makes the believed-in concept real to the believer. It cannot make it true in the real world, for the real world is quite unaffected by what its inhabitants think. And it often cannot make it true to others, where many may simply adopt the views of the local majority to avoid arousing trouble for themselves.

Over the centuries we have significantly added to the belief we started with—that a god simply created the universe. Many of us now infer that this god has a purpose in mind, that humans are intimately linked to this purpose, and that God periodically intervenes in our lives. We have made these assumptions because we cannot solve moral problems or make moral decisions (i.e., obtain peace of mind) without first holding (or, for many, actually believing) that our existence has purpose. Directing our daily activities toward accomplishing valued purposes gives us the comfort of feeling that our lives are meaningful.

But some beliefs prevent us from thinking logically about what surely must be important in life—the way we act when living. Behaviour blinded by benighted belief can have terrible consequences, as acts of terrorism regularly demonstrate.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Sets=

Presentations of logic vary in how much '''set theory''' they use.  Some are heavily laden with set theory. Though most are not, it is nearly impossible to avoid it completely.  It will not be a very important focal point for this book, but we will use a little set theory vocabulary here and there.  This section introduces the vocabulary and notation used.

== Sets and elements ==

Mathematicians use 'set' as an undefined primitive term.  Some authors resort to quasi-synonyms such as 'collection'.

A ''set'' has ''elements''.  'Element' is also undefined in set theory.  We say that an element ''is a member of'' a set, also an undefined expression.  The following are all used synonymously:

: ''x'' is a member of ''y''
: ''x'' is  contained in ''y''
: ''x'' is included in ''y''
: ''y'' contains ''x''
: ''y'' includes ''x''

=== Notation ===

A set can be specified by enclosing its members within curly braces.

: &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is the set containing 1, 2, and 3 as members.  The curly brace notation can be extended to specify a set using a rule for membership.

: &lt;math&gt;\{x : x = 1 \text{ or } x = 2 \text{ or } x = 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (The set of all ''x'' such that ''x'' = 1 or ''x'' = 2 or ''x'' = 3)

is again the set containing 1, 2, and 3 as members.

: &lt;math&gt;\{x : x \text{ is a positive integer}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and

: &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

both specify the set containing 1, 2, 3, and onwards.

A modified epsilon is used to denote set membership. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;x \in y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

indicates that &quot;''x'' is a member of ''y''&quot;.  We can also say that &quot;''x'' is not a member of ''y''&quot; in this way:

: &lt;math&gt;x \notin y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Characteristics of sets ===

A set is uniquely identified by its members.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{x: x\ \mathrm{is\ an\ even\ prime}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{x: x\ \mathrm{is\ a\ positive\ square\ root\ of}\ 4\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{2\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the same set even though the concept of an even prime is different from the concept of a positive square root.  Repetition of members is inconsequential in specifying a set.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{x: \mathrm{x\ is\ an\ even\ prime\ or}\ x\ \mathrm{is\ a\ positive\ square\ root\ of}\ 4\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 1\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 2\ \mathrm{or}\ x = 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the same set.


Sets are unordered.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{3,\ 2,\ 1\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{2,\ 1,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the same set.


Sets can have other sets as members.  There is, for example, the set

: &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,\ 2\}, \{2,\ 3\},\ \{1,\ \mathrm{George\ Washington}\}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Some special sets ===

As stated above, sets are defined by their members. However some sets are given names to ease referencing them.

The set with no members is the ''empty set''.  The expressions

: &lt;math&gt;\{\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\varnothing\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{x: x \ne x\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

all specify the empty set. Empty sets can also express oxymora (&quot;four-sided triangles&quot; or &quot;birds with radial symmetry&quot;) and factual non-existence (&quot;the King of Czechoslovakia in 1994&quot;).  


A set with exactly one member is called a ''singleton''.  A set with exactly two members is called a ''pair''.  Thus {1} is a singleton and {1, 2} is a pair.


&amp;omega; is the set of natural numbers, {0, 1, 2, ...}.

== Subsets, power sets, set operations ==

=== Subsets ===

A set ''s'' is a ''subset'' of set ''a'' if every member of ''s'' is a member of ''a''.  We use the horseshoe notation to indicate subsets.  The expression

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2\} \subseteq \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

says that {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3}.  The empty set is a subset of every set.  Every set is a subset of itself.  A ''proper subset'' of ''a'' is a subset of ''a'' that is not identical with ''a''.  The expression

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2\} \subset \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

says that {1, 2} is a proper subset of {1, 2, 3}.

=== Power sets ===

A ''power set'' of a set is the set of all its subsets.  A script 'P' is used for the power set.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}\{1,\ 2,\ 3\} = \{\varnothing,\ \{1\},\ \{2\},\ \{3\},\ \{1,\ 2\},\ \{1,\ 3\},\ \{2,\ 3\},\ \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Union ===

The ''union'' of two sets ''a'' and ''b'', written ''a'' &amp;cup; ''b'', is the set that contains all the members of ''a'' and all the members of ''b'' (and nothing else).  That is,

: &lt;math&gt;a \cup b = \{x: x \in a\ \mathrm{or}\ x \in b\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As an example,

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\ \cup\ \{2,\ 3,\ 4\} = \{1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Intersection ===

The ''intersection'' of two sets ''a'' and ''b'', written ''a'' &amp;cap; ''b'', is the set that contains everything that is a member of both ''a'' and ''b'' (and nothing else).  That is,

: &lt;math&gt;a \cap b = \{x: x \in a\ \mathrm{and}\ x \in b\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As an example,

: &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\ \cap\ \{2,\ 3,\ 4\} = \{2,\ 3\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relative complement ===

The ''relative complement'' of ''a'' in ''b'', written ''b'' \ ''a'' (or ''b'' &amp;minus; ''a'') is the set containing all the members of ''b'' that are not members of ''a''.  That is,

: &lt;math&gt;b \setminus a = \{x: x \in b\ \mathrm{and}\ x \notin a\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As an example,

: &lt;math&gt;\{2,\ 3,\ 4\} \setminus \{1,\ 3\} = \{2,\ 4\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Ordered sets, relations, and functions ==

The intuitive notions of ''ordered set'', ''relation'', and ''function'' will be used from time to time.  For our purposes, the intuitive mathematical notion is the most important.  However, these intuitive notions can be defined in terms of sets.

=== Ordered sets ===

First, we look at ordered sets.  We said that sets are unordered:

: &lt;math&gt;\{a,\ b\} = \{b,\ a\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

But we can define ordered sets, starting with ordered pairs.  The angle bracket notation is used for this:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle a,\ b\rangle\ \ne\ \langle b,\ a\rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Indeed,

: &lt;math&gt;\langle x,\ y\rangle\ =\ \langle u,\ v\rangle\ \mbox{if and only if}\ x = u\ \mbox{and}\ y = v\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Any set theoretic definition giving &amp;lang;''a'', ''b''&amp;rang; this last property will work.  The standard definition of the ''ordered pair'' &amp;lang;''a'', ''b''&amp;rang; runs:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle a,\ b\rangle\ =\ \{\{a\},\ \{a,\ b\}\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This means that we can use the latter notation when doing operations on an ordered pair.

There are also bigger ordered sets.  The ''ordered triple'' &amp;lang;''a'', ''b'', ''c''&amp;rang; is the ordered pair &amp;lang;&amp;lang;''a'', ''b''&amp;rang;, ''c''&amp;rang;.  The ''ordered quadruple'' &amp;lang;''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''&amp;rang; is the ordered pair &amp;lang;&amp;lang;''a'', ''b'', ''c''&amp;rang;, ''d''&amp;rang;.  This, in turn, is the ordered triple &amp;lang;&amp;lang;&amp;lang;''a'', ''b''&amp;rang;, ''c''&amp;rang;, ''d''&amp;rang;.  In general, an ''ordered n-tuple'' &amp;lang;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;rang; where ''n'' greater than 1 is the ordered pair &amp;lang;&amp;lang;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rang;, ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;rang;.

It can be useful to define an ''ordered 1-tuple'' as well:  &amp;lang;''a''&amp;rang; = ''a''.

These definitions are a somewhat arbitrary, but it is nonetheless convenient for an ''n''-tuple, ''n'' &amp;rang; 2, to be an ''n''-1 tuple and indeed an ordered pair.  The important property that makes them serve as ordered sets is:

: &lt;math&gt;\langle x_1,\ x_2,\ ...,\ x_n\rangle\ =\ \langle y_1,\ y_2,\ ...,\ y_n\rangle\ \mathrm{if\ and\ only\ if}\ x_1 = y_1,\ x_2 = y_2,\ ...,\ x_n = y_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relations ===

We now turn to relations.  Intuitively, the following are relations:

: ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y''
: ''x'' is a square root of ''y''
: ''x'' is a brother of ''y''
: ''x'' is between ''y'' and ''z''

The first three are binary or 2-place relations; the fourth is a ternary or 3-place relation.  In general, we talk about ''n''-ary relations or ''n''-place relations.

First consider binary relations.  A ''binary relation'' is a set of ordered pairs.  The ''less than'' relation would have among its members &amp;lang;1, 2&amp;rang;, &amp;lang;1, 3&amp;rang;, &amp;lang;16, 127&amp;rang;, etc.  Indeed, the ''less than'' relation defined on the natural numbers &amp;omega; is:

: &lt;math&gt;\{\langle x,\ y\rangle: x \in \omega,\ y \in \omega,\ \mathrm{and}\ x &lt;  y\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, &amp;lang;''x'', ''y''&amp;rang; is a member of the ''less than'' relation if ''x'' &amp;lt; ''y''.  In set theory, we do not worry about whether a relation matches an intuitive concept such as ''less than''.  Rather, ''any'' set of ordered pairs is a binary relation.


We can also define a 3-place relation as a set of 3-tuples, a 4-place relation as a set of 4-tuples, etc.  We only define ''n''-place relations for ''n'' &amp;ge; 2.  An ''n''-place relation is said to have an ''arity'' of ''n''.  The following example is a 3-place relation.

: &lt;math&gt;\{\langle 1,\ 2,\ 3\rangle,\ \langle 8,\ 2,\ 1\rangle,\ \langle 653,\ 0,\ 927\rangle\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Because all ''n''-tuples where ''n'' &gt; 1 are also ordered pairs, all n-place relations are also binary relations.

=== Functions ===

Finally, we turn to functions.  Intuitively, a function is an assignment of values to arguments such that each argument is assigned at most one value.  Thus the ''+ 2'' function assigns a numerical argument ''x'' the value ''x'' + 2.  Calling this function ''f'', we say ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' + 2.  The following define specific functions.

: &lt;math&gt;f_1(x) = x \times x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f_2(x) =\ \mathrm{the\ smallest\ prime\ number\ larger\ than}\ x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f_3(x) = 6 / x\ \!&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;f_4(x) =\ \mathrm{the\ father\ of\ x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is undefined when ''x'' = 0.  According to biblical tradition, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is undefined when ''x'' = Adam or ''x'' = Eve.  The following do not define functions.

: &lt;math&gt;f_5(x) = \pm \sqrt{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f_6(x) =\ \mathrm{a\ son\ of\ x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Neither of these assign unique values to arguments.  For every positive ''x'', there are two square roots, one positive and one negative, so ''f''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not a function.  For many ''x'', ''x'' will have multiple sons, so ''f''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is not a function.
If ''f''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is assigned the value ''the son of x'' then a unique value is implied by the rules of language, therefore ''f''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; will be a function.

A ''function f'' is a binary relation where, if &amp;lang;''x'', ''y''&amp;rang; and &amp;lang;''x'', ''z''&amp;rang; are both members of ''f'', then ''y'' = ''z''.


We can define many place functions.  Intuitively, the following are definitions of specific many place functions.

: &lt;math&gt;f_7(x,\ y) = x + y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f_8(x,\ y,\ z) = (x + y) \times z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &amp;lang;4, 7, 11&amp;rang; is a member of the 2-place function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.  &amp;lang;3, 4, 5, 35&amp;rang; is a member of the 3 place function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;


The fact that all ''n''-tuples, ''n'' &amp;ge; 2, are ordered pairs (and hence that all ''n''-ary relations are binary relations) becomes convenient here.  For ''n'' &amp;ge; 1, an ''n''-place function is an ''n''+1 place relation that is a 1-place function.  Thus, for a 2-place function ''f'',

: &lt;math&gt;\langle x,\ y,\ z_1\rangle\ \in f\ \mathrm{and}\ \langle x,\ y,\ z_2\rangle\ \in f\ \mathrm{if\ and\ only\ if}\ z_1 = z_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Are you really going to write some script to automagically convert to PDF and post the book to wikibooks?  That sounds like a nice idea.  There must be a page for discussing just that sort of thing.  But I cannot find it.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sideris. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sideris~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Prevention trials==
*'''Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (NSABP P-1)''', 1998 (1992-7)
**13000+ pts. Tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen could be used for breast cancer prevention. Enrolled high risk women who were 1) age 60 or older, 2) age 35-59 with a 5-year predicted risk of cancer of at least 1.66% (by Gail model), or 3) history of LCIS.  Randomized to placebo vs tamoxifen 20 mg x 5 yrs. 
**PMID 9747868 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/lofref.fcgi?PrId=3051&amp;uid=9747868&amp;db=pubmed&amp;url=http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jnci;90/18/1371 Full text], 1998 &amp;mdash; &quot;Tamoxifen for prevention of breast cancer: report of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 Study.&quot; Fisher B et al.  J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Sep 16;90(18):1371-88.
***Reduced risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (43.4 vs 22 per 1000). 56% reduction for pts with LCIS and 86% for atypical hyperplasia.  Reduced non-invasive breast cancer by 50%. No difference in ER-negative tumors. Risk of endometrial cancer RR=2.53.  No decrease in ischemic heart disease events.  Decrease in bone fractures.

***7-yr f/u. Reduce rate of invasive cancer by 43% (42.5 vs 24.8 per 1000). Reduced non-invasive cancer by 37%. Reduced osteoporotic fractures by 32%. 

*'''STAR: Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (NSABP P-2)''' (1999-2004)
**Randomized to tamoxifen 20 mg or raloxifene 60 mg x 5 yrs.  Entry criteria similar to BCPT except pre-menopausal women not allowed. 
**Target goal: 22,000 women.

* '''Prophylactic Mastectomy''' ''(Hartmann, et al.  NEJM 1999, 340, 77)''·	
** Mayo Clinic data suggest a 90% reduction in risk of developing breast cancer

==Hormonal therapy==
===Raloxifene===
*PMID 16837684  - ''Risk-Benefit Profiles of Raloxifene for Women (Editorial)'' (Stefanick ML, NEJM 2006 Jul 13; 355(2):190-192)
**'''RUTH: Raloxifene Use for the Heart''' (raloxifene 60mg in post-menopausal women at risk or with CHD)
***CHD: no impact
***BCA: -44% = 1.2 fewer cases per 1000 women/year
***vertebaral fxs: -35% = 1.3 fewer cases per 1000 women/year
***venous thromboembolism +44% = 1.2 excess cases per 1000 women/year
***fatal stroke +49% = 0.7 excess cases per 1000 women/year
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: raloxifene BCA benefit probably not worth the risk in women at risk for CHD
**'''Women's Health Initiative''' (postomenpausal women at average risk for BCA [trial placebo group], using raloxifene stats from RUTH)
***BCA: 1.7 fewer cases per 1000 women/year
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: raloxifiene BCA benefit minimal in &quot;average risk&quot; postmenopausal women, given the risk
**'''Breast Cancer Prevention Trial''' (tamoxifen in post-menopausal women at risk for BCA)
***BCA: -49% = 3.3 fewer cases per 1000 women/year
**'''STAR: Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene''' (women at high risk for BCA)
***no placebo group; similar rates of invasive BCA =&gt; comparable efficacy of tamoxifen and raloxifene =&gt; ~3.3 fewer cases per 1000 women/year)
**&lt;u&gt;Editorial conclusion&lt;/u&gt; Raloxifene efficacy at preventing BCA vs. causing thromboembolism/stroke depends on level of BCA risk. It is probably not worth it for &quot;average risk&quot; post-menopausal women.

==Overview==
*Accounts for ~22% of NHLs (2nd most common after [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/DLBCL|DLBCL]])
*Incidence increasing at ~4% per year
*Mean age at diagnosis 60
*Less common in Asians and Blacks; more common with &quot;Western&quot; lifestyle
*Presenting symptoms: painless peripheral adenopathy, which can wax and wane in size
*Malignancy grades defined by proportion of centroblasts (large cells)
**Grade 1-3a: various proportion of centroblasts - indolent
**Grade 3b: all centroblasts - aggressive (behaves like DLBCL, and should be treated as such)
*Extent of disease at diagnosis
**Stage I: 10-15%
**Stage II: 85-90%
**Frequently have extranodal involvement: bone marrow, spleen, liver in about 1/3 to 1/2.
**B symptoms: ~20%
*Clinical course is variable
**Some with indolent clinical course and late relapses over many years
**Others with rapid disease progression, often with transformation to aggressive lymphoma and early death
*Median survival 10 years. Considered incurable.
*Histologic transformation to aggressive (DLBCL) in ~25%

==Pathology==
*Arise from germinal center B-cells
*Mixture of centrocytes (small cleaved cells) and centroblasts (large cells)
**Grade 1: 0-5 large cells per hpf (used to be classified as follicular small-cleaved cell)
**Grade 2: 6-15 large cells per hpf (used to be classified as follicular mixed small-cleaved and large cell)
**Grade 3a: &gt;15 large cells per hpf, but centrocytes present
**Grade 3b: &gt;15 large cells per hpf, no centrocytes (used to be classified as follicular large cell) 
*Two variants, relationship to typical follicular lymphoma controversial
**Cutaneous follicle center lymphoma
**Diffuse follicle center lymphoma.


&lt;br&gt;'''Rappaport classification:''' nodular poorly differentiated lymphocytic, nodular mixed
&lt;br&gt;'''Working Formulation:''' follicular small cleaved, follicular mixed


*One model of disease development (based on PMID 17301308 and PMID 17043145 below)
**t(14;18) translocation occurs in healthy persons after activation (after undergoing Ig class-switch recombination during germinal-center response to antigenic stimulation)
**t(14;18) translocation results in bcl-2, a re-arranged gene whose product blocks apoptosis
**These cells are not naive (as previously thought) but capable of responding to an exogenous stimulus (such as virus or auto-antigen)
**A clone of t(14;18) can be detected in &gt;50% of healthy persons, and persists &gt;3 years. These may be memory B cells, circulating after initial stimulation
**In rare cases, can see pronounced peripheral blood B lymphocytosis (often secondary to infection), with clonal expansion of t(14;18)
**Further events may lead to transformation. These may be oncogenic events (&quot;hits&quot;) or may be related to stimulation via IgM receptors by T-cells. Predictive gene-array data at time of diagnosis suggest that random acquisition of oncogenic events does not play a large role in determining survival. Rather, it seems to be driven by B-cell interactions with non-malignant environment
**Can see in-situ follicular lymphoma, with histologically abnormal follicles, on LN biopsy. This may progress to overt follicular lymphoma, but may remain benign
**Further, there appear 2 separate disease processes (PMID 15548776): indolent (~75% of cases, with median survival of &gt;10 years) and aggressive (~25% of cases, with median survival ~4 years). This gene-array modelling agrees with Stanford watchful waiting outcome (PMID 15024027)
**This two-disease model, may be driven by mutually exclusive pathways:
***1) -6q/+1q
***2) duplication(18), +7/+8
**Depending on the environmental interplay, lymphoma may regress spontaneously
**t(14;18) in normal persons can therefore be seen as an early marker of lymphoma risk


*'''St. Bartholomew, 2007''' (UK) PMID 17278262 -- &quot;Transformation of follicular lymphoma to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma proceeds by distinct oncogenic mechanisms.&quot; (Davies AJ, Br J Haematol. 2007 Jan;136(2):286-93.)
**Gene expression profiles of 20 patients who transformed (pre- and post- biopsies)
**Conclusion: Two separate mechanisms; one via high proliferation characterised by presence of known oncogenic abnormalities, and second with similar behavior to the existing FL

*'''Netherlands, 2007''' PMID 17200149 -- &quot;Gene-expression and immunohistochemical study of specific T-cell subsets and accessory cell types in the transformation and prognosis of follicular lymphoma.&quot; (Glas AM, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Feb 1;25(4):390-8.)
**Gene level: highly uniform by gene arrays. Cell level: high discrimination by IHC for transformation phenotype
**By ICH, 2 cell populations: &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;activated&quot;. Activated much more likely to transform to aggressive (DLBCL) lymphoma
**Conclusion: FL is an immunologically functional disease, highly uniform at time of diagnosis, but where interaction between the tumor cells and the environment determines clinical aggressiveness

*'''Marseille, 2006''' (France) PMID 17043145 -- &quot;Follicular lymphoma-like B cells in healthy individuals: a novel intermediate step in early lymphomagenesis.&quot; (Roulland S, J Exp Med. 2006 Oct 30;203(11):2425-31.)
**A new model for development of follicular lymphoma proposed

*'''NCI, 2004''' PMID 15548776 -- &quot;Prediction of survival in follicular lymphoma based on molecular features of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.&quot; (Dave SS, N Engl J Med. 2004 Nov 18;351(21):2159-69.)
**Gene expression profiles. 191 biopsy specimens, 95 used for supervised expression patterns, 96 validating set
**Two signatures constructed for survival prediction: quartilies median survival 13.6, 11.1, 10.8, and 3.9 years
**Discriminant gene expression: non-malignant tumor-infiltrating cells
**Conclusion: 75% of cases indolent disease with &gt;10 year survival, 25% cases aggressive disease with 4 year survival

==Natural history==
*Stanford, 2005 - PMID 15024027 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stage I and II Follicular Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Long-Term Follow-Up of No Initial Therapy.&quot; Advani R et al. J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 15;22(8):1454-9. 
**Retrospective. Follicular small cleaved and follicular mixed. 43 pts with therapy deferred at least 3 months after diagnosis and minimum follow-up of 1 year.
**Median follow-up 86 months. 63% had not been treated. Median time to treatment was 22 months.  4 of 16 transformed to higher grade. Survival at 5, 10, and 20 years was 97%, 85%, and 22%.
**Conclusion: Delayed therapy is appropriate in selected pts.


==Prognostic Factors==
*'''FLIPI 2:  Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index Update''' (2012) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19652063 PMID: 19652063] &amp;mdash; &quot;Follicular lymphoma international prognostic index 2: a new prognostic index for follicular lymphoma developed by the international follicular lymphoma prognostic factor project.&quot; Federico et al. J Clin Oncol. 2009 Sept 20;27(27).

FLIPI2: The following factors were found to be predictive of outcome in patients with follicular lymphoma: 

Age                                                      &gt; 60

Largest diameter of largest involved node                &gt; 6 cm

bone marrow involvement    

β2-microglobulin                                          &gt; upper limit normal

serum hemoglobin level                                    &gt; 12 g/dl

Low risk  = 0 risk factors,            5 year PFS 79.5%

int risk  = 1-2,                                  51.2%

High risk = 3-5,                                  18.8%

*'''MD Anderson, 1984''' Follicular large cell lymphoma - PMID 6376721 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/lofref.fcgi?PrId=3051&amp;uid=6376721&amp;db=pubmed&amp;url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6376721 Full text], 1984 (1973-81) &amp;mdash; &quot;Follicular large cell lymphoma: analysis and prognostic factors in 62 patients.&quot; Kantarjian HM et al.  J Clin Oncol. 1984 Jul;2(7):811-9.

*'''GELA, 1999''' (France) (1986-95) - PMID 10561315 &amp;mdash; &quot;Low-grade stage III-IV follicular lymphoma: multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in 484 patients--a study of the groupe d'Etude des lymphomes de l'Adulte.&quot; Decaudin D et al. J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2499-505. 
**284 pts treated on two Phase III trials. Stage III-IV. 
**3 factors significant on multivariate analysis: B symptoms, age &gt; 60, at least 3 nodal sites &gt; 3 cm. IPI score was prognostic, but very few pts had high IPI scores.

'''Ongoing trials:'''
*'''SWOG S0016''' - phase III.  CHOP vs CHOP + Rituxan (R-CHOP) vs CHOP + I131-tositumomab (Bexxar) for newly diagnosed follicular NHL. CHOP alone arm closed to accrual early (Dec 2002).

==Management Overview==
*For Stage I-II, radiotherapy is standard. However, long-term data from Stanford suggest that in select patients, active surveillance may be a reasonable approach
*For advanced disease, treatment is deferred until the patient becomes symptomatic. Randomized trials of chemotherapy showed no survival advantage to early treatment thus far
 

==Stage I-II==
===Watchful Waiting===
*'''Stanford, 2005''' - PMID 15024027 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stage I and II Follicular Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma: Long-Term Follow-Up of No Initial Therapy.&quot; (Advani R et al. J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 15;22(8):1454-9.) 
**Retrospective. Indolent follicular (follicular small cleaved and follicular mixed). 43 patients with therapy deferred at least 3 months after diagnosis and minimum follow-up of 1 year. Median follow-up 7.2 years. 
**Outcome: 63% not treated. 10-year OS: 85%, 15-year OS: 58%. Estimated median OS 19 years
**Progression: 16 patients (8 progression, 4 transformation to aggressive). If progression, median time to treatment 22 months. Median time to transformation 7.8 years
**Conclusion: Delayed therapy is appropriate in selected patients

===RT alone===
*'''Stanford, 1996''' (1961-94) - PMID 8648385 &amp;mdash; &quot;Is radiotherapy curative for stage I and II low-grade follicular lymphoma? Results of a long-term follow-up study of patients treated at Stanford University.&quot; Mac Manus MP et al. J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1282-90. 
**Retrospective. Stage I-II. RT was involved field, extended field, TLI, or STLI. 
**Median f/u 7.7 yrs. 10-yr OS 64%. MS 13.8 yrs. 10-yr RFS 44%. Pts are unlikely to relapse after 10 years. 

===RT dose===
*'''UK, 2011''' PMID 21664710 &amp;mdash; &quot;Reduced dose radiotherapy for local control in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a randomised phase III trial.&quot; Lowry et al. Radiother Oncol. 2011 Jul;100(1):86-92. 
**Randomized dose-finding for NHL (primarily follicular and marginal zone). RT was involved region. Randomized to 40-45 Gy '''versus''' 24 Gy in 12 fractions (indolent) or 30 Gy in 15 fractions (aggressive). 
**Median f/u 5.6 yrs. Progression-free and overall survival equivalent between low- and high-dose arms.
**Conclusion: 24 Gy in 12 fractions effective for indolent NHL.

*'''Florida, 1999''' PMID 10348285 -- &quot;The impact of radiotherapy dose and other treatment-related and clinical factors on in-field control in stage I and II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&quot; (Kamath SS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Jun 1;44(3):563-8.)
**See also page at: [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/Treatment_high_grade]]
**285 pts w/ Stage I-II NHL (72 low grade, 92 intermediate to high grade, 21 unclassified). 159 treated w/ RT alone, 126 combined modality.
95 treatment failures with 12 in-field failures. Most failures occurred in contiguous non-irradiated areas.
**Conclusion: &quot;Our analysis suggests that the overwhelming problem in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not in-field failure but, rather, failure in contiguous unirradiated sites. A dose of 20-25 Gy may be sufficient for small-volume LGL of the orbit. A dose of 30 Gy is sufficient for LGL in general&quot;

===Chemo-RT===
*'''MD Anderson, 2003''' (1984-1992) PMID 12775737 -- &quot;Long-term follow-up of a prospective study of combined modality therapy for stage I-II indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&quot; (Seymour JF, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jun 1;21(11):2115-22.)
**Prospective. 102 patients, Stage I-II low grade (follicular 83%, bulky &gt;5cm 24%, Stage II 52%). Treated with risk-adapted COP-Bleo/CHOP-Bleo and RT 30-40 Gy IF. Median F/U 10 years
**10-year outcome: OS 82% (follicular 80%); DFS 76% (follicular 72%). After relapse, 10-year survival 46%
**Toxicity: acute 10% hospitalization, long term 12 malignancies (4 in RT fields)
**Conclusion: CMT better DFS and OS than previously reported RT alone

===Rituxan-based===
*PMID 15483015 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prolonged clinical and molecular remission in patients with low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy: 9-year follow-up.&quot; Czuczman MS et al. J Clin Oncol. 2004 Dec 1;22(23):4711-6.
**CHOP + Rituxan

==Stage III-IV==
===Radiation===
*'''Heidelberg; 2010''' PMID 20331739 -- &quot;Clinical outcome of patients with follicular lymphoma and bulky disease after Rituximab-CHOP immunochemotherapy with and without consolidating radiotherapy.&quot; (Fabienne M, Eur J Haematol. 2010 Mar 16. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. Subset analysis of RCT evaluating number of Rituximab cycles with CHOP x6. 42 patients with bulky disease, protocol specified IRFT but some did not receive it (62% IFRT, 38% no RT). Median F/U 5 years
**Outcome: Relapse RT+ 46% (50% within original bulk) vs RT- 56% (NS). 6-year PFS 52% vs 48% (NS), 6-year OS 80% vs 73% (NS)
**Conclusion: In patients treated with CHOP-R, no difference in control regardless if IFRT was used

===Rituxan===
*'''Multi-national''' -- CVP vs R-CVP
**Randomized. 321 patients, CD20+ Stage III-IV folicullar lymphoma requiring therapy. Arm 1) cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone (CVP) vs. Arm 2) CVP, rituximab (R-CVP)
**'''2008''' PMID 18662969 -- &quot;Phase III study of R-CVP compared with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone alone in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma.&quot; (Marcus R, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 1;26(28):4579-86. Epub 2008 Jul 28.) Median F/U 4.4 years
***Outcome: 4-year OS CVP 77% vs. R-CVP 83% (SS); median TTF (SS) CVP 7 months vs. R-CVP 27 months (SS). Improvement regardless of FLIPI, IPI, B-symptoms, or bulky disease
***Conclusion: Adding Rituximab to CVP improves all outcome measures, including OS

*'''Multi-national''' -- Zevalin consolidation
**Randomized trial of 414 pts with stage III/IV follicular lymphoma with a CR or PR after first line induction therapy. Allowed a variety of first line therapies, CVP, CHOP, CHOP-like, fludarabine, rituximab.
**'''2008''' PMID 18854568 -- &quot;Phase III trial of consolidation therapy with yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan compared with no additional therapy after first remission in advanced follicular lymphoma.&quot; (Morschhauser F, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 10;26(32):5156-64.) Median f/u 3.5 yrs.
***Patients randomized to zevalin vs no further treatment.
***A significant increase in PFS was seen with zevalin (36.5 vs 13 months). Benefit for treatment was zevalin was seen regardless of initial CR or PR.


'''''Ongoing trials:'''''
*'''SWOG S0016''' 
**Bulky stage II, Stage III-IV, previously untreated. 
**Randomized to: 1) CHOP, 2) CHOP + Rituxan, 3) CHOP + I-131 Tositumomab (Bexxar).

==Palliation==
*Standard treatment: Limited fields to 20 Gy in 10 fractions
*Low dose treatment: Limited fields to 4 Gy in 2 fractions (2x2)
**Initially evaluated because:
***There is no clear dose-response relationship in localized low-grade NHL
***Low-dose (1.5-2.0 Gy) fractionated TBI resulted in long-term survival in advanced disease patients
***Good long-term control in patients who stopped treatment for convenience after 5-7 Gy
***However, a randomized trial (FoRT) shows that the low dose RT regimen is inferior to 24 Gy in 12 fractions
**Response rate is ~80-90%, with CR rate ~50-60%, and good local long-term control
**Response is rapid, typically within a week. Median time-to-progression is &gt;1 year in recurrent/chemo refractory patients
**Gene-expression profiling showes strong p53-mediated induction of apoptotic pathways
*For [[Radiation_Oncology/Palliation/Spinal_Cord_Compression|spinal cord compression]], consider one of the standard (8/1 or 20/5 or 30/10) regimens

===Low dose RT===
'''''Randomized:'''''
*'''FoRT''' - 24/12 vs 4/2
**Randomized, non-inferiority trial. 548 pts (614 treatment sites) with FL or MZL requiring either palliative or radical RT. Closed early (short of 650 treatment sites). FL in 86%, MZL in 14%. Curative in 40%, palliative in 60%. Stage I-II in 63%, Stage III-IV in 37%. Prior chemo in 33%, prior RT in 24%.
**'''2012''' ASTRO #LBA 3 [http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0360-3016/PIIS0360301612037741.pdf PDF] -- &quot;FoRT: A Phase 3 Multi-Center Prospective Randomized Trial of Low Dose Radiation Therapy for Follicular and Marginal Zone Lymphoma&quot; (Hoskin P, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys Vol. 85, Issue 1, Page 22)
**Median f/u 22.8 mo. Response rate: 24 Gy - 81% overall, 60.3% CR; 4 Gy - 74.1%, 44.3% CR (SS). Local progression free survival rate at 2 yrs: 93.7% (24 Gy) vs 80.4% (4 Gy). No OS difference.
**Toxicity: limited in both arms -- Acute G3+ in 8 pts vs 5 pts; Late G3+ in 9 pts vs 6 pts. No overall difference in QOL. 
**Conclusion: &quot;While 4 Gy in 2 fractions can be effective in the palliative setting, it is significantly inferior to 24 Gy in 12 fractions which should remain the schedule of choice for curative radiation therapy in follicular or marginal zone lymphoma.&quot;

==Translocations==
*Lymphoma cells generally do not exhibit significant microsatellite instability (unlike many solid tumors)
*Chromosomal translocations are a hallmark of lymphomatous disorders
**t(8;14) - Burkitt's lymphoma (c-myc)
**t(11;14) - mantle cell lymphoma (bcl-1)
**t(11;18) - MALT lymphoma
**t(14;18) - follicular lymphoma (bcl-2)

''mnemonic:'' The common ones (on exams anyway) have 14 in common.  The 11 sits on top of 14 (they're in sequence) like something sitting on a ''mantle''. The 8 in Burkitt's resembles the bilaterally swollen neck lymph nodes like you typically see in a picture of a child with Burkitt's. The 8 (18) of follicular resembles two little follicles stuck together to form the 8.  The oddball one is MALT which doesn't have the 14.

==Staging==
*Uses the [[Radiation_Oncology/Hodgkin/Overview#Staging|Ann Arbor classification]], which was developed for Hodgkin's lymphoma.  
*Since disease spread in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma differs from that in Hodgkin's lymphoma, in which spread occurs to adjacent nodal groups in a stepwise fashion, the Ann Arbor classification which relies on nodal staging is not as predictive for NHL.

==International Prognostic Index==
Risk factors:
*LDH greater than normal
*Age &gt; or = 60
*Performance status ECOG 2 or worse
*Extranodal sites of disease (more than 1)
*Stage III or IV
*:''Mnemonic: LAKES (LDH,age,Karnofsky,Extranodal,Stage)''

Risk groups:
*Low - 0 or 1 risk factors
*Low intermediate - 2
*High intermediate - 3
*High - 4 or 5

Prognosis:
*Low risk: 87% CR and 73% OS at 5 years
*High risk: 44% CR and 26% OS

Based on pts with aggressive lymphomas treated with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.  It is also useful in indolent lymphomas and T-cell lymphomas. 
These factors independently predict complete response to therapy, relapse-free survival, and overall survival.

===Modifications===
'''Age-Adjusted International Prognostic Index:'''
Developed for pts younger than 60. Uses tumor stage, performance status, and LDH (but not extranodal sites or age). Assigned score of 0 to 3 based on number of risk factors and assigned same labels (low, low int, high int, or high). 


Reference: PMID 8141877 [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/329/14/987 Full text] - &quot;A predictive model for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project.&quot; N Engl J Med. 1993 Sep 30;329(14):987-94. 
*1982-1987. 3273 pts. Allowed diffuse mixed, diffuse large-cell, or large-cell immunoblastic histologies from the Working Formulation (overlaps with intermediate and high grade but doesn't include all subtypes). Also allowed Kiel and Rappaport. Pts were treated on Phase II-III study. All received combination chemo consisting of doxorubicin. Evaluated potential prognostic factors: sex, age, tumor stage, performance status, B symptoms, sites of involvement, number of extranodal sites, size of tumor, LDH, albumin, and beta-2-microglobulin. Complete information obtained in 1872 pts.

'''Stage-modified International Prognostic Index:'''
*Same as IPI but uses Stage II disease (rather than Stage III-IV disease) as the cutoff
*Used in Limited Stage Aggressive Lymphoma

==Survival==
Estimates from AJCC staging manual, 6th edition:
*Follicular lymphoma: 2-year OS 85%, 5-year 70%. FFS (failure free survival) 2-year 65%, 5-year 45%.
*Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: 2-year OS 60%, 5-year 50%. FFS 2-year 50%, 5-year 45%.
*Mantle cell lymphoma: 2-year OS 60%, 5-year 25%. FFS 2-year 30%, 5-year 10%.
*Small lymphocytic lymphoma: 2-year OS 70%, 5-year 50%. FFS 2-year 50%, 5-year 30%.

= King's Gambit =
White offers a pawn (and temporarily weakens his king side) in order to get the opportunity to play d4.

Black can accept the pawn and play [[/2...exf4/]] or refuse it. In the second case, many opportunities are offered to him. The most played are [[/2...Bc5/]] and [[/2...d5/]]. Black could also reasonably play [[/2...Nc6/]] a variation that is rarely explored. White is considered to surrender an advantage when black accepts the gambit, and as such the lines of the King's Gambit Declined have become unpopular at the master level.

(For more information about articles, see the [[Neapolitan/articles]] page.)

Generally, masculine and neuter nouns end in '''o''' and feminine nouns end in '''a'''

Also, nouns which begin with the letter '''a''' tend to be feminine.

=== Plurals ===
A given noun's gender is not as clearly evident in Neapolitan as it is in Italian.  ''Most'' masculine nouns end in '''o''', ''most'' feminine nouns end in '''a'''.  Most but not all.  Not all nouns change endings in the plural, vowels at the end of words are often indistinct in any case so may not be much help.  Feminine nouns ''tend'' to double the first consonant when they are plural, but once again not always.  The best way to determine the gender of a noun is by its article or by the endings on any modifiers it may have, for example: ''''o cunto''', masculine; ''''a lavannara''', feminine; ''''e cunti''' masculine plural; ''''e llavannare''' feminine plural.  

The plural is occassionally formed by changing the body of the word itself. This primarily happens in words already ending in '''e''' to begin with, for example ''''o guaglione''' masc. singular becomes ''''e guagliune''' and ''''o cazone''' masc. singular becomes ''''e cazune'''.



The ''neuter'' case is apparent by its characteristic doubling of the initial consonant.  It is reserved for: 
*'''abstract concepts-''' 'o mmale (''evil''), 'o nniro (''the color black'')
*'''classes/genres of things-''' 'o ffolk (''folk music'')
*'''elements and minerals-''' 'o ffiero (''iron''), 'o cchiummo (''lead'')
*'''foodstuffs-''' 'o llatte (''milk''), 'o ccafè (''coffee'')
*'''adjectival nouns-''' 'o mmericano (''the American''), 'o bbrutto (''the ugly'')
*'''noun forms of past participles-''' 'o ccuótto (''the cooked''), 'o mmuórto (''the deceased'')
*'''nouns derived from verbal infinitives-''' 'o vvevere (''drink'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What country did they live in?==
[[Image:Vedic India.jpg|thumb|left|Vedic India]]
The Vedic people lived in about 3000 BC in what is present day India and Pakistan. The civilization was established from the plains of the Ganges River (India) to the Indus River (India-Pakistan)The people who developed vedic civilization are known as Aryans. The notable contribution of the Aryans can be traced from their litreature, which is well known as vedic litreature. such an ancient and varied litreature is not to be found in any other part of the world. the life of the earliest Aryan is represented in the Rigveda which was composed in 1500 B.C.

==What did their buildings look like?==
The early Vedic people led a nomadic lifestyle, meaning that they moved from place to place. Later, as agriculture became more important, they began to settle down. They lived in huts made of straw and later built houses out of wood.The early vedic Aryans lived in the valleys of Sindhu, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Bias, Sutlej and Saraswatirivers in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent.

== What did they eat? == 
Dinner might have been warm tasty wheat bread served with barley or rice. It would appear they were very good farmers. They grew barley, peas, melons, wheat, and dates. Farms raised cotton and kept herds of sheep, pigs, zebus (a kind of cow), and water buffalo. Fish were caught in the river with fish hooks!  Each town had a large central storage building for grain. Crops were grown, and the harvest stored centrally, for all in the town to enjoy.

==What did they wear?==
At first,in very ancient times clothing was made out of animal skin. Later cotton, silk and other different plant based yarns and gold, silver and copper threads were used.

Clothing generally consisted two pieces of fabric, one wrapped around the upper body, and the other wrapped around the lower body. Men wore different types of pants, ''Dhotis'', loin cloths and different varieties of shirts, scarves and stoles. A wide range of headdress and turbans were used.

[[Image:''Sari'' fabric.jpg|thumb|left|''Sari'' fabric.]]

Women had a greater choice in clothing. They also wore ''dhotis'' and sometimes wore turbans too. When the'' dhoti'' was worn, it was also worn with a blouse (''choli''), and a scarf. Also available to wear was the ''sari'', a length of fabric wrapped around the body with the loose end thrown over the shoulder. ''Cholis'' were worn with ''saris.''  Finally, gold and other precious stones worn by men and women have been found. There were a wide range of ornaments for both men and women. A wide range of accessories were used by both men and women including handbags and shoulder bags.

The people used to dress according to their age, profession, and social status.

==What did their writing look like?==
The ''Vedic'' people wrote in ''Sanskrit''. The '''''Rig Ved''''', the oldest of the four ''Veds'' (see below), was composed in what is known as ''Vedic Sanskrit'' before writing was introduced to India. Later, writing was introduced, and classical ''Sanskrit'' began to emerge.

[[Image:''Rigveda'' MS2097.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Rig Veda'', written in ''Sanskrit''.]]

The ''Sanskrit'' language is one of the world's oldest languages, and is related to many modern-day languages in the Indo-European group of languages. These languages, including English, have words that are related to'' Sanskrit'' words. Here are some of these words:

==What religious practices did they follow?==
The early Aryans were worshipers of the forces of nature which they considered as their deities. the chief deities were Varun, Agni, Usha and Aditya. the idea of 'Ekam Sat' [god is one and one alone] formed the basis of their religion that God is omnipresent. the universe is emanated from the 'sat'.Worship of God by any name and in any form ultimately reaches the 'Ekam Sat'.Tolerance is deeply rooted in Indian psyche.
The Vedic religion was the source of some of the world's oldest religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism. The religion was centered around the Brahmins (priests), who made sacrifices to the gods, took care of the religious needs of society and maintained the temples. Priests were given a very important place in society. They were guided by the Vedas, a collection of sacred &quot;revealed&quot; texts containing mantras, hymns, and sections on meditation, mysticism, and philosophy. There are four vedas - Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharvana.

People worshiped with the help of the Brahmins. They performed sacrifices and chanted verses. They prayed for children (especially male children), cattle, and wealth.

Some rituals and sacrifices included:
*The drinking of Soma, a drink made by pressing juice from the stalks of a certain mountain plant. The exact plant is unknown.
*Fire rituals, such as:
**The Agnihotra, a ritual involving prayer to Agni, the fire god.
**The Agnicayana, a ritual which takes twelve days to perform, during which a great bird-shaped altar is built out of more than a thousand bricks.
**The Agnistoma or fire sacrifice.
*The Ashvamedha. 
*The Purushamedha or human sacrifice.
*Rituals concerning demonology and magic.

The main gods of the Vedic religion were Indra[king of Gods], Agni (fire), and Soma. Lesser gods included Varuna[god of rain], Surya (the Sun), Mitra, and Vayu (the wind). Goddesses included Ushas (the dawn), Prithvi (the Earth) and Aditi. Rivers, especially the Sarasvati, were also considered goddesses.

==Are some of them famous even today?==
Perhaps the most famous of the Vedic people is a grammarian by the name of Pānini. He was born around 5 BCE. He is known for formulating the 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology (the study of the structure of word forms) known as the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Among Western linguists (people who study languages), he has a reputation of perfectly describing these rules. In fact, computer scientists have used these rules to teach computers the Sanskrit language! The grammars used to describe programming languages, called Backus-Naur form grammars, are very similar to Pānini's grammar rules.

According to some traditions, the mathematician Pingala was the younger brother of Pānini. He was the first mathematician to describe a binary numeral system, the Fibonacci series and Pascal's triangle. Perhaps the most famous would be Aryabhatta, who is credited with the discovery of &quot;zero&quot;, without which, no major scientific or mathematical breakthrough would have been possible. A series of books called Vedic Mathematicsa has been published which show how to use formulas that lead to short methods of calculations which in modern mathematics are complicated. The Vedas contain knowledge in all branches of science.

==What is left of them today?==
===Hinduism===
The influence of the Vedic people can be seen in Hinduism, which arose from the ancient Vedic religion. It is not possible to place a date on the actual origin of Hinduism. The practices and traditions that have culminated into what is today known as Hinduism are estimated by some scholars to have begun from 3102 BC to 1300 BC. It can be said with some justification that Hinduism is the world's oldest religion. Hinduism of today is essentially the &quot;Sanatana Dharma&quot; of the Vedic times - the philosophy of how to lead the proper, productive, useful life. The name Hindu is in fact a more recent artifact, the result of the interactions with and invasions by East Asian, Central Asian and European warrior clans. More generally, it is thought that the name &quot;Hindu&quot; was used by ancient outsiders to describe the peoples east of the &quot;Sindhu&quot; river which flows through the present-day Punjab regions of India and Pakistan.

Hindus (people who follow Hinduism), believe in Dharma, Karma, and Moksha. Very simply, Dharma is a way of life - to align the human body, mind, and soul in harmony with nature. Karma literally translates to action. Vedic and post-vedic philosophy places tremendous importance on Karma, because that is the only thing that a person has control over. Karma is the sum of everything a person has done in his or her life. The concept of karma is similar to the concept of reaping what you sow. Good deeds result in good results, while bad deeds yield bad results. Moksha is liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. The word Moksha is used to describe the final goal of all intelligent life - merging one's essential spirit (atman) to become one with the universal spirit (Brahman).

Hindus also believe in the gods and goddesses of the Vedic people. Even though there have been many influences on Hinduism and the underlying philosophies over the ages, it is believed that the Sanatana Dharma has essentially continued the same way it was in Vedic times.

In the early Aryan age the four vedas: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and athrvanaveda were composed. Rig veda is the first book composed. In the later Vedic age the great epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha were written.

===Caste System===
The Vedic people categorized people's roles in society into four categories - the four &quot;varnas&quot;. The four categories were the labor class (Shudra), merchant class (Vaishya), warrior class (Kshatriya) and the priestly class (Brahmin). Over time this categorization led to misinterpretation and exploitation and became what is today called the Hindu caste-system.

The Brahmins became the highest caste. They were the priests and holy men. Next were the Kshatriyas, the warriors and rulers. The Vaishyas were the merchants and businessmen. Last were the Shudras, the servants and labourers. In addition to the above four castes, those who performed &quot;unclean&quot; jobs, were deemed to be outside the caste system and were the &quot;untouchables&quot; - those within the caste system did not have direct contact with them. Mahatma Gandhi called them harijans - children of God. They today call themselves dalits - the oppressed. 

The caste system was originally based on division of labour, but over time was used to control religious and social life as well. Although the caste system is now outlawed in India, its effect is still felt in daily life. Discrimination against lower castes still exists, and many dalits still live in poverty. However, the Indian government has set up programs to educate them and help them out of poverty.

===The importance of cows===
Just as they were sacred to the Vedic people, cows are also sacred to Hindus. In Hinduism, all animals are held sacred and the cow especially so. Thus Hindus don't eat the meat of the cow. There is a regional holiday called Mattu Pongal (literally Cow Pongal in Tamil), which is a thanksgiving day for cows. In addition, there is a tradition which holds that a divine cow named Kamadhenu - the giver of countless boons - is considered to be the mother of all Hindu Gods..

===Sanskrit===
The ancient language of the Vedas is still taught in Indian Schools. The roots of most of the modern north-Indian languages, including Hindi, Bengali and Gujarati, lie in Sanskrit.

Although there is no community of native speakers today, Sanskrit hymns are still used in most Hindu rituals.
Sanskrit is still the spoken language in the town of Mattur in Shimoga District, Karnataka State in India. Even languages from the South-India like Malayalam originated from Sanskrit and Tamil influence. Spoken Sanskrit scholars are becoming extinct, but an organisation called Samkritha Bharathi is slowly reviving the language, with its free Sanskrit camps and classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Be ye angry and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath: Neither give place to the devil.''' Ephesians 4. 26 - 27.

The crux of the matter --as far as anger is concerned is that it's an emotion that can be provoked in us by the actions of others or our response to situations around us. Emotions are a part of our soul (mind, will &amp; emotions) and created by Almighty God. However, if not properly managed, anger can be very destructive. Anger is an emotional sign that tells us that something is wrong. It's okay to be angry, it's what we do with that anger that can get us into trouble! That is why Paul acknowledges that we will get angry on occasion. We must deal with the cause of the anger. Allowing it to linger could give room for the devil to manipulate us.

== New Naming Policy ==

Hello,

I see you did some new entries into the Programming Book. I like to suggest that you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:22, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

== Merger ==
Although [[Game maker]] follows the naming convention better this book has more information.  Also it shouldn't take alot of work to bring this book up to the naming convention. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 22:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
:The merge was already proposed in reverse, I've now completed it as no objections existed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:13, 26 January 2010 (UTC)

== Category ==
i think this should me put into the game maker category.

{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 pound prepared [[Cookbook:Puff pastry|puff pastry]]
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* Four (1/2-inch thick) fresh [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] slices, tough inner core removed; or canned pineapple slices
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
* Freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

== Procedure ==
=== Pastry ===
# On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry into a square about 1/8-inch thick. 
# Using a 4-inch plate as a guide, or a cutter, cut four disks of pastry. 
# If you are using a plate, cut the pastry with a rolling pizza cutter or the tip of a small sharp knife. 
# Transfer the cut pastry rounds to a baking sheet. 
# Pierce the pastry 6 to 8 times with the tines of a fork. The punctures will help prevent the dough from rising unevenly during baking. 
# Chill the pastry in the refrigerator while you prepare the sugar. 

The disks can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated for 1 day or frozen for up to a week.

=== Tart ===
# Preheat the oven to 425° F. 
# In a small, heavy-bottomed pan, dissolve the sugar with the water. 
# Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until caramelized. 
# Do not stir the sugar as it cooks or it may recrystallize. 
# Swirl the pan when the sugar begins to brown. 
# Carefully pour the caramelized sugar into four 4-inch 10-ounce ramekins.
# Place the pineapple slices in the ramekins on top of the caramel and season lightly with salt and pepper. 
# Lay a pastry disk on top of each pineapple and transfer the ramekins to a baking sheet. 
# Bake the tarts for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown. 
# Remove ramekins from the oven and cool for 5 minutes. 
# Holding the ramekins carefully with a cooking mitt, twist the puff pastry to loosen the tart, caramel, and pineapple together. 
# Carefully invert the ramekins to release the tarts onto individual serving plates. 

Serve the tarts warm or at room temperature.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Pastry can be purchased in the frozen food section of most markets.

Isn't Neapolitan Sauce a tomato sauce without ham?

Oh for the love of. Does anyone measure anymore? This either needs a heavy edit to add measures, or deletion.</text>

{{recipe}}

A delicious, creamy sauce, perfect for meat or vegetables.
==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|Anchovies]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:fennel|fennel]], chopped 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], chopped 
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], chopped 
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], split
* A pinch of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* A pinch of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Gill|gill]] [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], boiled 
* Bones of one [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]

==Procedure==
# Wash anchovies in vinegar, bone and pound using a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]] with fennel and a pinch of cinnamon.  
# Mix in  parsley and marjoram, a squeeze of lemon juice, flour, cream, and the bones of the fish for which you will use this sauce. 
# Pass through a sieve, add garlic, and boil. 

==Tips, tricks, and variations==
If the fish you are using is cooked in the oven, add a little of
the liquor in which it has been cooked to the sauce.  Take out the
garlic before serving.  Instead of anchovies you may use caviar,
pickled tunny, or any other pickled fish.

'''Ham Sauce''' (in Italian, '''''Salsa di Prosciutto''''') is a relatively quick and simple sauce used to coat pasta or served over rice. This is *not* a glaze for baked ham, rather a sauce on its own that incorporates ham.

==Quick and Easy Modern Recipe==

=== Ingredients ===
* 3 to 4 oz. ham or proscuitto, cut into strips
* 1 tsp. tomato puree
* 1 oz. butter
* 2 cups vegetable stock (meat stock also fine)

=== Procedure ===
* Melt butter in small saucepan and gently saute strips of meat. 
* Stir in tomato puree.
* Add stock and simmer for about five minutes.
* Serve over rice or toss with pasta.

==Historic Recipe==

=== Ingredients ===
* 28g (1 ounce) [[Cookbook:Ham|Ham]]
*3 dessert spoons Musca or sweet [[Cookbook:Port Wine|port]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]]
*[[Cookbook:Basil|Basil]]
*[[Cookbook:Spice|Spice]]

=== Procedure ===
Cut up an ounce (28g) of ham and pound it in a mortar, then mix it with three dessert spoonfuls of port or Musca and a teaspoonful of vinegar, a little dried basil and a pinch of spice.  Boil it up, and then pass it through a sieve and warm it up in a [[Cookbook:Bain-marie|bain-marie]]. Serve with roast meats. If you cannot get a sweet [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] add half a teaspoonful of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. Australian Muscat is a good wine to use.

In cooking, '''espagnole sauce''' is one of the [[Cookbook:Sauces|mother sauces]] that are the basis of sauce-making in classic French cooking. Auguste Escoffier codified the recipe in the late 19th century, which is still followed today.  

==Methodology==
The basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]], to which are added several gallons of [[Cookbook:Stock|veal stock]] or water, along with 20 or 30 pounds of browned bones, pieces of beef, many pounds of vegetables, and various seasonings.  This blend is allowed to slowly reduce while being frequently skimmed. The classical recipe calls for additional veal stock to be added as the liquid gradually reduces but today water is generally used instead.  Tomato sauce is added towards the end of the process, and the sauce is further reduced.

==Uses==
Espagnole has a strong, even somewhat unpleasant taste and is not itself used directly on food. As a ''mother sauce'', however, it then serves as the starting point for many ''derivative sauces''. Examples are: Sauce Africaine, Sauce Bigarade, Sauce Bouguignonne, Sauce aux Champignons, Sauce Charcutiere, Sauce Chasseur, and Sauce Chevreuil, just to go as far as the &quot;Cs&quot;.  There are hundreds of others in the classic French repertoire.

A typical espagnole recipe takes many hours or even several days to make, and produces four to five quarts of sauce.  In most recipes, however, one cup of espagnole is more than enough, so that the basic recipe will yield enough sauce for 16 to 20 meals.  Frozen in small quantities, espagnole will keep practically indefinitely.

==Escoffier's Recipe==
Yield: 4 quarts&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Auguste Escoffier (1907), ''Le Guide culinaire''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ingredients===
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:Roux#Brown Roux (Roux brun)|brown roux]]
*6 quarts [[Cookbook:Brown Stock|brown stock]]
*8 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:Mirepoix|mirepoix]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Bouquet Garni|bouquet garni]]

===Procedure===
#Dissolve the cold roux  in a bowl by stirring in some of the cold brown stock.
#Heat the rest of the stock in a deep, thick saucepan over a medium-high flame and bring to a boil. Lower the heat.
#Temper the roux by ladelling some of the stock into the roux while whisking vigorously.
#Stirring constantly, slowly pour the tempered roux into the simmering stock.
#Dissolve the tomato paste with some of the stock and stir it into the sauce.  Add the mirepoix and the bouquet garni.
#Simmer slowly, partially covered for 2 or 3 hours.  From time to time skim off any scum.
#Add more stock if the sauce thickens too much.  You should end up with a sauce that coats a spoon lightly.
#Adjust the seasoning. Strain and degrease thoroughly.

Can be refrigerated or frozen.

===Mrs W.G. Water's Recipe===
The following recipe, taken from ''The Cook's Decameron: A Study In Taste'', apparently dates from the late 19th century and bears no relation whatsoever to the classic espagnole as it is  not thickened except for a tiny amount of flour and should only be regarded as a curiosity.

'''Ingredients'''
* 2 ounces (55g) butter
* Slices of veal, ham, bacon, beef or poultry
* 3 peppercorns
* Mushroom trimmings
* 1 Tomato
* 1 Carrot
* 1 Onion studded with two cloves
* 1 diced Turnip
* Sprig Thyme, Parsley, and Marjoram
* 1 Teaspoon flour
* ¼ pint (150ml) Stock

'''Method'''

# Grease the bottom of a stew pan with at least two ounces of butter
# Add the slices of lean veal, ham, bacon, beef  or poultry, three peppercorns, mushroom trimmings, a tomato, a carrot and a turnip cut up, an onion stuck with two cloves, a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, parsley and marjoram
# Braise well for 15 minutes with the lid on
# Add the stock and boil gently for 15 minutes
# Strain through a Tamis, then remove excess grease
# Cool in an earthenware vessel, and add glaze if desired
# Pass through a sieve before serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waters|first=Mrs. W.G.|date=1920|title=The Cook's Decameron: A Study In Taste|publisher=IndyPublish.com|isbn=1404345809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spelling changes==

I removed the capitalization (i.e. &quot;Espagnole&quot; to &quot;espagnole&quot;) because that's the way ''LaRousse Gastronomique'' has it. I also tried to alway call it &quot;expagnole sauce&quot; for the same reason.

Thoughts?

[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 05:51, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, I entirely agree that if one is writing French titles (of anything not only recipes) in French, as opposed to an English translation, one should adhere to French capitilization pratices. However, most English language translations of French cookbooks do not do so including my translation of ''[[w:en:Le Guide culinaire|Le Guide culinaire]]''. In French only the article and first noun are capitalized. Adjectives are capitalized only if they precede the first noun. Proper nouns are always capitilized of course which may cause errors if one doesn't know that a word in the name of a sauce is the name of a person. I wish I had made a note of my source for this information because obviously it is useful to know and to be able to cite when necessary. I'll do a Google search and see if I can find it again.

== Why the wrong recipe? ==

I don't know if I'm missing something here....  It's one of those times where I find it hard not to be very sarcastic.  :-)

The page has a recipe which it says &quot;bears no relation whatsoever to the classic Espagnole&quot; and advises us &quot;should only be regarded as a curiosity.&quot;

I'm trying to figure out why there would be an apparently wrong recipe written into entry. I haven't deleted it just yet, but I'm thinking to move it over to the Wiki Cookbook (it's probably quite tasty, so why kill it?), and replace it with Carême's recipe, or Escoffier's--just as soon as I get my hands on them.  Perhaps somebody has them readily available?
*It's there because someone put it there early on for reasons I don't understand.  I later wrote the stuff about &quot;no relation to&quot; etc. but felt diffident about deleting the earlier stuff.  Frankly, I think it's baloney and should be either deleted or moved.  The problem with replacing it with the *real* recipe is that *that* recipe might then be moved by someone else over to the Cookbook -- I once put a recipe for &quot;tartiflette&quot; in Wiki (to go with an article that mentioned it) and then it was, after a vote, moved to the Cookbook.  But I'd be happy enough to see this particular phony recipe disappear -- whoever put it in apparently had this old, non-copyrighted cookbook and he went around sticking recipes from it into various articles without much regard as to whether they should really be there or not.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 06:19, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Sounds like we're thinking along the same lines.

As to your recipe for '''tartiflette'''.  I've been thinking about this recently (not tartiflette, but recipes in the Encyclopedia versus in the Cookbook).  In general, I'm thinking that recipes belong in the Cookbook, with the Encyclopedia perhaps having a direct pointer.  But also I'm thinking that some things are fundamental enough that they belong here (and probably there, too).

The basic espagnole sauce is an example of a &quot;belongs here&quot;. The history of French cooking is clearly a good subject only for the Encyclopedia; the mother sauces, as defined by Carême and Escoffier, are central parts of that history; the definition of each of the four to seven mother sauces '''is''' their recipe. So I'm inclined to put recipes for the basic sauces here (particularily the traditional recipes), but put recipes for pretty much all the derivative sauces over in the cookbook.

And as for your tartiflette recipe:  This is the Wikipedia: Be bold! Revert!  :-)

[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 07:05, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)
**I agree with everything you say, I guess, as long as there are clear links from the ency. to the cookbook.  It's sort of klunky, though, having to log in a second time with the Cookbook if you want to have a Watchlist etc -- I always forget to do so.  As for the mother sauces, I agree that all of them should be shown in the encyl.  Espagnole, however, is a '''tremendous''' process to write down if you want an '''exact''' way of doing it, not just a professional cook's shorthand recipe, which could be a single paragraph.  I myself have on my computer a somewhat simplified version I came up with years ago (mostly from Julia Child but with some elaborations), and I have on my shelves the 4- or 5-page Sokolov version in his wonderful book on sauces.  But even '''his''' needs some extra commentary and explanations.  Since I make it very rarely, I haven't felt it necessary to go beyond the book version (with all my notes in the margins) and spend several hours rewriting it in order to get it into my computerized recipes.  Probably on the Net there's a dozen recipes for espagnole, some of which aren't copyrighted or could be fairly easily rewritten for inclusion here.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 17:35, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)
***As for the tartiflette recipe, as I recall there was one of those formal discussion and vote thingees and it was decided to move it.  I could have argued my side of it at the time, but I figured, Why bother?  And the links that someone provided made it easy enough to get to.  If you like to eat and cook, you might check it out -- I also provided a couple of nice photos to go with it.  And '''exact''' instructions on how to make it.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 17:35, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)


Man! I put a comment here yesterday, and it's gone. There were reports that the Wiki was loosing things yesterday (or maybe I just forgot to press the 'save' button).  Anyway, I'll try again.
I changed the wording about how long it takes to make the sauce from 'days' to 'hours' because of what I was reading in the 1988 (English) Larousse Gastronomique (p. 423). I've never tried to make espagnole sauce myself, so I may have to defer to your experience.

I was hoping to find the original recipes from Carême or Escoffier (or maybe both) to include here; those seem appropriate for an Encyclopedia. Coutine has two recipes in his Larousse entry, one &quot;from Carême's recipe&quot; and a short, modern one. As far as I can tell, Carême's stuff is no longer available (it's even listed as 'missing' in the Library of Congress catalog). I've looked at ''The Saucier's Apprentice'', or there's that new biography of him that I haven't gotten my hands on just yet.


[[User:DanielVonEhren|DanielVonEhren]] 16:23, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)
*Yeah, it took a while yesterday for my comments to show up -- something was going on.  As for the time to make it, I rechecked my &quot;Saucier's&quot; book and I see that I've written in the margins: &quot;takes at least 3 or 4 days to make&quot; -- and that was when I was doing it with my wife and mother to help.  I'll do it again by myself one of these days but I know in advance that it's a multi-day project.  I suppose that if you were a pro. restaurant that trimmed its own meat, etc., so that you had bones and scraps and pig rind and calves feet and weird stuff like that lying around, *plus* you also happened to have a pot of homemade tomato sauce sitting on the stove, *maybe* it would be possible to make it in *2* days, or even 1 day if you had different shifts of workers attending to it continuously.  Remember, first of all it has to reduce for about 8 hours.  Then more stuff is added and it is reduced again.  And maybe a third time, plus a reduction with the tomato sauce.  This is why, even in France, it is seldom made in the classic tradition anymore.  As I recall, either seeing, or reading, a major French restaurant will have 4 or 5 big pots of espagnole simmering at the same time, in various stages of reduction and preparation -- which is why there's generally no hurry in getting it made in the least amount of time.
**As for the original recipes I'll see what I can find, but it's surprising that Careme's or Escoffier's isn't easily available, at least in a French-speaking source.... 18:59, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rationale for stating that humans need religions can be summarized as follows. First, the universe has taught us that survival can depend upon thinking and behaving rationally. Second, to make a behavioural choice rationally it must be directed toward achieving some purpose. Third, real-world problems must satisfy criteria found in the real world to be successful. Fourth, moral problems are invented through mental word-play, and a metaphysical environment and valued purpose must be assembled before moral behavioural choices can be rationally made. And last, we invariably do our best to believe in the truth of our constructions, because belief that we are correct eliminates the stress that accompanies doubts about the validity of what we think, say, and do.

In the previous chapter we noted that religions grow from the visions of (mainly) one person, a person whose beliefs are particularly strong, clear-cut and convincing. This raises two questions that beg to be investigated. First, what makes these beliefs so convincing to such individuals (and, later, to their followers) that they may willingly endure torture, and even choose to die rather than change their minds? And, second, from where do such beliefs come—could there be a source other than a god?

Both of these questions can be answered by returning to the discussion of how the mind works. We begin with a short review of how memories become linked together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Memories&lt;ref&gt;Recall that in [[../../Thinking/The Mind|The Mind]] we defined memories to include such elements as facts, theories, opinions, personal experiences, emotions, past thoughts, ideas, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; are synaptically linked to other memories, and these links can be made in several ways.

Transient links are made all the time. For instance, when preparing to take a holiday we typically think about where we are going, what the weather might be like, what clothes we should take, what money or documents we might need, etc. Our thoughts, in this example, might seem to be occurring more or less at random, jumping from weather to clothes to money, but they are not at all disconnected. If we really wanted, we could find the exact memory item that triggered the mental jump from weather to clothes, from clothes to money, and so on. There is always a path followed by our thoughts from one memory to the next; it creates what is often called a train of thought.

Sometimes, we make memory links in play. We build connections between memories in our thoughts and so make associations between events that may never have actually taken place. We do this, for example, when we daydream, or when we plan how we would spend the millions we might win in a lottery. Once chains of thought have been built in this way, they are often revisited.&lt;ref&gt;Something like the following was once said by an assembly-line worker: “Everyday I comes in, and I switches on the machine. Then I marries the Duke. . . .”&lt;/ref&gt; Replaying any chain of thought strengthens it, which makes future recalls easier.&lt;ref&gt;Easier, but often less accurate. Over time, the accuracy and truth of any event held in memory can become unwittingly modified. Memories become erroneously linked (as witnesses’ differing statements make obvious). What we think happened may not in fact have happened at all. A wished-for fantasy (for example, that the girl or boy next door had a crush on you) can later be remembered as reality, and is a disorder that has been called the False Memory Syndrome. (See Elizabeth Loftus &amp; Katherine Ketcham, ''The Myth of Repressed Memory: False Memories and Allegations of Sexual Abuse'' [New York: St. Martin’s Press, Inc., 1996] for a discussion of this syndrome.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Severing the link between the left and right hemispheres of the brain can also cause false memories. The left hemisphere (which searches for and provides explanations of observations recorded primarily in the right hemisphere) when disconnected can be shown to invent reasons for witnessed events, because the mind needs to resolve the conundrum such unexplained events pose. See Michael S. Gazzaniga, “The Split Brain Revisited,” in the July 1998 issue of ''Scientific American'', 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more definitive linkage, discussed in [[../../Solving Problems/]], occurs when we problem solve. Permanent links between previously unlinked memories are likely to form whenever significant relationships are found.

Memory chains can be short or lengthy. Many older folk, for example, can recall exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first learned of President Kennedy’s assassination. This is likely to be a short sequence, robustly formed in association with strong emotions, but not often part of a longer sequence. On the other hand, a journey once taken, or detailed plans to build an elaborate addition to the house, for instance, might be stored as very lengthy chains of linked memories.

We all possess many useful, short and long, memory chains, assembled during daily living or taught to us by others. They form actual mental structures, just like the ones we have been calling the neural networks that store discrete memories, but longer and more complex. Whenever activated, they give rise to thoughts and actions that usually play out in succession.&lt;ref&gt;For example, any long-partnered individual can often predict how their companion will respond or behave, because many responses stem from  a “hardwired” neural network chain.&lt;/ref&gt; As more-or-less permanent memory structures, they minimize the amount of thinking to be done (and therefore the amount of energy expended) when there is little novel to be considered in the triggering situation. Memory chains are important enough to deserve their own name: I term them constructs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Everyone’s mind contains millions of constructs, most very small (such as the phrases we habitually use—our semi-automatic response [“Hello! How are you?”] to a neighbour’s greeting, for instance), others much larger (such as those that auto-pilot the movements of our hands and feet as we drive to work thinking of other things). Every time a construct is used, additional synaptic knobs form along its pathways. These enlarge the construct’s primary routes, which then offer less resistance to future biochemical transmissions. This, in turn, increases the probability that this route will be taken the next time one’s locus of thought is in this region of the brain.

Constructs are supremely valuable for all animals because they facilitate rapid reaction to danger. Constructs automate some of the brain’s activity, producing appropriate responses to stimuli for the least expenditure of energy and in the shortest possible time. Constructs in humans allow much mental activity to be carried out at the relatively fast, non-verbal, subconscious, second level of thinking. For instance, everyone (particularly athletes, musicians, and those executing rapid body movements) becomes more proficient through practice; an important part of practising involves the development of mental constructs.

However, acting solely in response to preformed mental constructs without at least some analysis of incoming stimuli to determine their implications can be dangerous for any animal. Constructs can undermine and limit the ability to perceive, analyze, understand, integrate and generally profit from observations. Furthermore, they diminish creativity and originality.&lt;ref&gt;There is an even higher cost to holding constructs: they are never accurate. The reality-depicting constructs that we hold in our minds are always incomplete, and therefore somewhat false representations of the real world outside. Our senses, our interpretations of what they are telling us, and the way we rebuild in our mind what we imagine exists in the external world, all distort the accuracy of the mental constructs we hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Plato believed the reverse. He taught that our minds can comprehend the ideal, and that the real world is only a poor representation of this absolute. In fact, our minds comprehend a (not-too-poor) representation of the true reality that exists outside of the mind. (Plato’s ideas gave rise to a science based upon religion and philosophy. This resulted in a millennium of science being used for little other than to “illustrate and interpret the scriptures.” See Middleton, ''The Scientific Revolution'', 34.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Interestingly, numerous scientists and mathematicians currently suspect that the basis to reality is mathematical and therefore abstract rather than concrete.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructs cause each of us to become progressively more set in our ways, simply because biochemical flows take the path of least resistance through a neuronal maze. Thus thoughts tend to follow the same neural paths, constantly reinforcing them.&lt;ref&gt;This, naturally, reduces our ability to be creative. (See [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]])&lt;/ref&gt; As we age, we encounter fewer situations where we need to think afresh about how to respond, for we have previously experienced many of a similar nature. Our thoughts simply follow patterns locked within earlier-formed constructs whenever more-or-less appropriate ones are found. Consequently, we begin acting in characteristic, typical, or even stereotypical, ways. Eventually, if we never try to break out of these neuronal ruts, we start to think that nothing is new, and we may slowly lose interest in external happenings.

Constructs may also monopolize thoughts. This is a particularly interesting feature from this book’s point of view. If a significant amount of time or energy is spent thinking about any one subject, a construct-dominated mind can develop. Hobbies, careers, lovers, philosophies, food, business, probably anything we care to consider, can create this effect. We probably all know an individual with whom any conversation soon turns into an exposition of their particular interest. This happens because their mind has long pursued one particular theme and found relationships between it and many other memories. Ideas which might simply be interesting but unconnected bits and pieces of information to other persons can become linked to the central theme of interest in an obsessed person’s mind. What once were dozens of discrete constructs can become one major Construct. This can change a fixated person’s whole outlook on life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Understanding that the mind develops (and is, to varying degrees, dominated by) a wide variety of mental constructs prepares us to investigate the two questions posed in the introduction to this chapter: what makes conversions so convincing, and from where might they come?

Reformations, conversions and revelations all involve mental constructs; we will consider each in turn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reformations might be divided into two types: minor ones (which change one’s way of thinking but little else), and reformations which change behaviour. Neither kind is particularly significant to the current discussion, but will be examined because doing so helps us understand what happens when conversions and revelations occur. 

We “reform” our way of thinking when we accept another’s point of view. For instance, someone might point out that we have always maintained that such-and-such was true, whereas, in fact, it is not true. They might then provide justifications that we realize are valid and, after a moment’s thought, we accept. In such cases, just a few, often secondary, neural constructs are disassociated. During this minor reformation, new links between a few memories will be formed, leaving the old associations to atrophy from neglect. This behaviour is usually the result of third-level conscious thinking, and typically happens during conversations or while reflecting upon something recently read, heard or seen. It is often permanent and will affect our thinking, but it may never affect our behaviour.

Behaviour-changing reformations are a somewhat more complex form of neuronal modification because more constructs are involved. However, the new neural patterns that form may not be permanent. For instance, recognizing that an excess of calories is going straight to the waistline and deciding to diet often produces a “reformation” that lasts no longer than a few weeks. More significant reformations, perhaps on the scale of forsaking habits such as alcohol, recreational drugs or gambling, may be more permanent. Reformations (of any kind) often fail without regular boosts such as those provided by support groups, because mental links to earlier constructs which present enticing goals (usually rich with associated emotions) remain.

More permanent reformations occur when some new mental purpose is held to be more attractive than a previous one, and decisions are then made in order to attain this new goal. As long as the latest purpose is sufficiently valued, the mind’s decision-making process refers to this new purpose for guidance. This means, of course, that reformations last only as long as the new purpose is held in higher regard than the previous one. For any reformation to last, the prior purpose must be permanently replaced by the new one. For example, memories of eating favourite chocolates and of their pleasurable taste sensations, might be replaced by thoughts of looking slim and being fit. Using terminology defined in [[../../Making Decisions/]], we might say that the purpose guiding our activities must be switched from valuing a sensation of gustatory pleasure to valuing slimness or health.&lt;ref&gt;This implies that there are degrees of “valuing.” (See also [[../../Determining Moral Behaviours/]].)&lt;/ref&gt; For the reformation to be long lasting, a fresh construct must be deliberately built focused upon attaining the new end result. In short, it’s not the diet that produces enduring results, it’s the mind-set.

Reformations, then, are consciously made decisions to change one’s behaviour in order to gain a newly desired goal. They fail as soon as the goal or purpose loses its attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Army “boot camps” regularly operate by enforcing a behavioural mode; after a while this becomes the soldier’s mind-set. In time, such conditioning can even create belief. (Pompous “Colonel Blimp” personalities believe that their way of behaving is the one-and-only proper way to behave, and many children are brought up possessing beliefs inculcated in this manner.) The kind of “reformation” we are discussing in Chapter Five occurs in the reverse order. It starts within the mind with a changed way of thinking, and behavioural change follows later. Either sequence of events develops mental constructs.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Conversions, on the other hand, create long-lasting effects. “Conversions” are the result of a change of belief, a belief that can be about anything. The following discussion relates only to religious conversions.

Religious conversions&lt;ref&gt;Much of what is being written here about religious conversions applies equally well to any kind of conversion (e.g., to fascism or communism).&lt;/ref&gt; come in two flavours; those induced by some external influence (a speaker at a mass meeting, or in a church, for instance) and those self-induced (the ones that seem to arrive “out-of-the-blue”). The first kind happen relatively often; the second, rarely. The prerequisite for either kind to occur is a prepared mind (one that is usually quite stressed—see the next section for more about this).

Externally-induced conversions cause the converted to accept the theology of an existing religion. The environment, beliefs and purpose-for-living, often remembered from past exposures to the religion and usually already present as minor memory constructs within the mind,&lt;ref&gt;The work of Sunday school teachers and missionaries illustrates this point. Each describes the background, the stories, the key features of their religion, and explains the significance of their rituals to their listeners. They are painting a picture that attempts to convey the reality and relevance of a religious environment to those who lack such an environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once some of these details have been absorbed, once a store of religious information exists to draw from, the pupil may be ready to take the next step. Neophytes are encouraged to value the attainment of some goal that the leader has in mind. The leader’s zeal, obvious conviction, passion, and very presence as someone to emulate, all aid this process. What happens next depends upon how these ideas are perceived by the recipient. Often,  in children, nothing visible occurs; the listener absorbs the speaker’s intention, but does not feel impelled to do anything more. On occasion, in adults, when mental conditions (i.e., constructs  created by past experiences and learnings) are receptive, something very dramatic happens: the listener experiences a “conversion.”&lt;/ref&gt; are accepted in their entirety. People undergoing induced conversions (whether from external or internal sources) are likely to explore and cement this happening by reading, talking to like-minded others, and thinking about what has happened. Mentally, they are realigning existing constructs, seeking and strengthening those that point toward the newly adopted purpose, and turning suddenly seen associations into connections, all the time reinforcing the new construct’s position and significance within their revised mind-set. Eventually, if the conversion experience has been particularly powerful, many formerly small and unconnected constructs become realigned and joined to make one large Construct. And, as noted in the previous section, this new Construct may come to dominate much of such individual’s thinking, and control much of their behaviour.

Externally induced conversions differ from reformations only in scale. Periodic refreshing is often needed if the adopted purpose is not to fade over time. This reinforcement is typically obtained by attending religious institutions or gatherings. Secular conversions occur, of course (to communism, for example) and these are commonly systematically reinforced by political boosts given in meetings. Terrorists, religious or otherwise, are often products of induced conversions; they, too, are given periodic indoctrination and training aimed at maintaining their level of commitment.

Self-induced religious conversions are also usually to an existing religion. Very rarely, they occur in the mind of individuals who do not convert to an existing religion but become the harbingers of a new one. It is this kind of event we must examine (although, as we will find, the causal mechanism in both situations is very similar).

Self-induced conversions are almost always the result of a “revelation.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">As mentioned in section four of the last chapter, leaders of any significance are invariably people who have thought long and hard about existing conditions and how matters might be improved. Some leaders only slowly realize they have a workable solution to offer and then act. They might write articles and books, as did Karl Marx. Others (in particular most everyday leaders) appear to decide and act without spending any appreciable time thinking about what to do. This is usually because they have already experienced (or have earlier spent time working through) alternative possibilities, and they come to the role armed with several appropriate solutions, primed and ready for different contingencies.

However, sometimes individuals recognize in one blinding flash that they actually have ''the'' solution. In such cases, they are often said to have had a “revelation.” Such occurrences do not happen very often and only occur to those whose mind has been dwelling upon an apparently insurmountable problem for a considerable amount of time. For such individuals, there is an instant of recognition, when the truth is suddenly revealed. This has often been described (see next section for some documented examples) as being accompanied by misty patterns of light,&lt;ref&gt;Western accounts not infrequently also report the appearance of white-cloaked, Christ-like figures.&lt;/ref&gt; and the whole experience is marked by a plethora of intensely strong and pleasurable emotions: surprise, wonder, elation, euphoria, and sometimes a feeling of being united with the universe. These emotions erupt the instant it is realized, with unequivocal certainty, that the definitive, long-sought, solution-to-a-critically-important-problem has been found. Accompanying feelings of pure joy sometimes continue for weeks.

Revelations that produce this effect need not always follow a search for meaning, or be the result of a religious mental struggle. Many scientists and artists have reported identical feelings to those mentioned above. These experiences occur, for them, the instant they realize they have found the answer to a problem long worked upon. Their emotions, just as the emotions of those experiencing a religious conversion, gush forth the moment their mind replaces many of its old and disjointed constructs with one that is more appropriate and functional. The “eureka” solution transforms disorder into order, doubt into certainty, complexity into simplicity, and stress into delight.

Those who have experienced a revelation of any kind, are often forced by their new Construct to become leaders, devoted to communicating to others the truth that has been revealed to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">But what is the source of such revelations? Such perfectly fitting, almost complete, solutions to long-pondered problems could not have come from nowhere. Some, even many, might insist that revelations could only come from a divine being. While this supposition cannot be entirely ruled out,&lt;ref&gt;See later chapters (and [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]]) for reasons why it is not possible to prove either that a god exists or does not exist.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems an unnecessarily complex explanation for the revelation experiences that have been reported by scientists and artists, and it simply obstructs further investigation when attempting to account for those of a religious nature. We should not accept the “divine origin” explanation too readily; there could be a more mundane source.

Once looked for, this source is not hard to find. The new-found solution, its organizing principle or purpose, and the accompanying Construct, all come from work done by subconscious second-level thinking.&lt;ref&gt;I am indebted to Timothy Ferris for this insight. See “The Interpreter,” an essay in Ferris’s interesting book, ''The Mind’s Sky: Human Intelligence in a Cosmic Context'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, from the individual’s own mind. To fully appreciate just what happens to produce a revelation, we should first discuss a few non-religious (and therefore likely less controversial) examples of its more common occurrence.

We are all very familiar with third-level thinking, where we use words in our minds to think consciously about things. But, as noted earlier, this is not the full extent of our thought processes. Second-level thinking (when associations between memories, or between memories and related incoming information, are found and when more or less permanent links between memories may be formed) occurs subconsciously all the time. While not discussed in depth previously, other stimuli besides incoming information can instigate subconscious neural link-formation or thinking. One cause, important to our investigations, is stress—in particular, stress caused by constantly ruminating about the same, apparently insoluble, problem.&lt;ref&gt;Animals also transfer mental activities performed consciously into the subconscious. Analysis of the neural firing patterns of Australian zebra finches when singing and when asleep indicate that the birds rehearse the song during their slumber. (See Daniel Margoliash in ''Science'', 30 March, 2001.) Similarly, the neural firing patterns that rats produced while negotiating a maze were repeated exactly when these rats slept. (See Kenway Louie and Matthew A. Wilson, “Temporally Structured Replay of Awake Hippocampal Ensemble Activity during Rapid Eye Movement Sleep,” in ''Neuron'', January 2001, 145-156.) These subconscious activities may occur as synaptic knob growth transforms temporary memory loops into permanent neural networks, or they may be the brain’s way of strengthening memories and constructs by repeatedly retracing mental routes taken earlier. Alternatively, the neural firing may be induced as the animal’s mind attempts to reduce some kind of stress-causing primitive fear—fear of the consequences that might arise should they forget what has been learned, perhaps.&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of stress makes itself known in various ways—sometimes mentally, as with dreams or nightmares,&lt;ref&gt;Stored emotions, with their accompanying tensions, anxieties and stresses, drive many of our dreams. By dreaming, the mind reduces the amount of energy it would otherwise have to expend when awake to handle the by-products of these anxiety-causing emotions. Dreaming achieves this by activating possible stress-relieving (although not necessarily logical) alternative networks to those creating the stressful emotions. In other words, to determine if a dream has any significance, its emotional content must be sought and explored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Discussing dreams reminds me that my wife, every year or so, dreams that she has lost her purse. These dream experiences, although stressful when occurring, perhaps act cathartically to relieve pressures accumulating from a possibly continual minor worry about the safe whereabouts of her purse. (This happens to be an example where the context as well as the emotion is relevant; dreams are not usually this easy to interpret.)&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally physically, with ailments such as headaches or upset stomachs.&lt;ref&gt;Stress-produced chemicals may be released into the blood-stream during attempts to solve difficult problems; if so, then these might be the cause of “psychologically upset stomachs.”&lt;/ref&gt;

That dreaming is often related to stress is generally well-known. We have all probably experienced waking in the middle of the night, feeling anxious, and thinking that our problems are particularly serious. But, upon waking in the morning, following periods of REM (“rapid eye movement”) or dream sleep, we may feel that our predicament is not so bad after all. (We even have a saying, “you’ll feel much better in the morning,” that acknowledges this.) Occasionally, something marvellous happens: we awake with the answer we have been looking for, and know that our problem has been solved. Such occurrences illustrate a little of what our subconscious mind is capable; they also help to substantiate the fact that the mind is continuously working, even though we are not aware of it doing so. Dreams are secondary manifestations of this work; remembered portions of dreams provide fleeting glimpses of what has been happening at the subconscious second level during sleep.

Many people have recorded how long-elusive solutions sometimes arrive suddenly, quite unexpectedly, out of the blue. Henri Poincaré, a great mathematician, in an insightful essay ''Mathematical Creation'',&lt;ref&gt;To be read in a version edited by James R. Newman as a sidebar under the topic Creativity, in ''Microsoft Encarta, DVD-ROM Reference Suite 99'' (Microsoft Corporation, 1999) originally printed in the August 1948 edition of ''Scientific American''.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that he discovered Fuchsian functions in a coffee-induced, semi-dreaming state, after spending fifteen days attempting to disprove their existence. In this essay, he explored how the subconscious must continue the search for a solution, then present the “''good combination''” to the conscious mind when found. He postulated that conscious thought liberated the elements of the problems, and that these might then fly about the subconscious mind like gnats or atoms of gas until a fortuitous encounter produced the sought-after “good combination.”

Many similar examples of second-level subconscious thought breaking through into second- and third-level conscious awareness have been described in the literature. One probably known by all organic chemists is Kekulé von Stradonitz’s 1865 realization that the benzene molecule is ring shaped. Kekulé reported thinking about possible structures while dozing in front of a fire, seeing long rows of carbon and hydrogen atoms dancing into different snake-like configurations in the flames, and eventually observing one snake seize hold of its own tail. He immediately awoke, recognizing instantly that this had to be the correct molecular arrangement.

Another example of this phenomenon was recently reported in the local press. The chairman of a company described how he was very surprised to find the answer to a problem he had been wrestling with for a week, written in his notebook when he opened it one morning at work. He remembered leaving the notebook downstairs when he went to bed the previous night, but nothing else. He then realized that he must have dreamed the answer, sleep-walked, written it down, and then gone back to bed, all without wakening. The answer in the notebook was perfect. It was immediately put into effect, and the company’s efficiency doubled.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottawa Citizen'', February 26, 2001, B4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutions so found are typically discovered upon wakening, but they can arrive, abruptly and unannounced, anytime.&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, in his essay ''Mathematical Creation'', reports two daytime instances when (after days of prior thought) solutions suddenly presented themselves to him.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent book relates how a daytime breakthrough suddenly occurred to Dr. Folkman, a dedicated cancer researcher, while sitting in Boston’s Temple Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cooke, ''Dr. Folkman’s War: Angiogenesis &amp; the Struggle to Defeat Cancer'' (New York: Random House, 2001), 242-243.&lt;/ref&gt; In another publication, it is reported that Charles Darwin remembered exactly where he was when he suddenly realized why offspring differed from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Desmond and James Moore, ''Darwin, The Life of a Tormented Evolutionist'' (New York: Warner Books, Inc., 1991), 419-420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to our main concern, it is now relatively clear what must be happening at the subconscious level before and during a revelation’s occurrence.

When awake, our conscious mind seeks solutions to problems by searching for relationships between memories, or between memories and incoming stimuli (recall the “drill-bit search” example given in [[../../Thinking/Second-Level Thinking—Association|Second-Level Thinking—Association]]). Using its knowledge of the properties of each element within the environment presenting the problem, the alert mind can determine when an appropriate solution has been found. Furthermore, both the conscious and subconscious are aware of ongoing searches and any resolutions. Similarly, when solutions cannot be found, this also is “known” both consciously and subconsciously.

However, unlike the conscious mind, the subconscious always addresses the same problem: stress. Any problem-related activity it undertakes is not aimed at finding a solution to a dilemma in mathematics, organic chemistry, cancer growth, or a reason to live, to use examples we have mentioned. The outcome sought by the subconscious is merely a path of lower bioelectrical resistance through the mental constructs continually being activated by the conscious mind. It seeks this because a path of lower resistance consumes less energy, and thus generates less stress.

The subconscious seeks routes of lower resistance when it can; that is, when its neural pathways are not occupied by incoming stimuli or pre-empted by demands from conscious-level activities. During this free time (obtained mostly when the body is sleeping), the subconscious seeks pathways of lower resistance (i.e., links that more directly join the involved memories) from within the mind’s museum of memories and constructs. In finding networks that reduce its energy consumption, the subconscious solves problems that interfere with its primary task of directing a healthy body, not those related to the world outside its realm. But, the subconscious does solve such problems, indirectly, and must do so relatively frequently.

Thus, simply by seeking a network that produces lower resistance and lessened stress, the subconscious finds routes which position formerly overlooked memories within new constructs. It does all of this, it must be emphasized, with absolutely no knowledge that the solution it has uncovered has any possible meaning in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;A similar, but entirely unrelated, process is used by “data-mining” computer software. In this practice, vast amounts of information (for instance, the data banks of an insurance company, large retail outlet, or DNA-sequencing enterprise) are searched to find any qualitative or quantitative co-relationships or commonalties that may exist. By this method, even software that has been given absolutely no instructions about attributes to look for, can find new and often significant connections between various data. These new associations can then be used by forward-thinking individuals to develop new opportunities, products or lines of research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any time after a new neural network (construct) has been built in this manner, a revelation can occur. Revelations are simply sudden breakthroughs, from the subconscious to the conscious mind, of the new understandings that a revised neural network denotes.

Revelations of any kind, scientific, artistic, managerial, or otherwise (including those that set the stage for, and result in, a self-induced religious conversion) occur abruptly and quite unexpectedly. And because the solution presented has been tailor-made by the subconscious to relieve stress caused by the conscious mind’s incessant thinking about one particular problem, this solution solves that problem. It immediately feels right, there is a sudden release of tension, and a flood of emotion surges forth.&lt;ref&gt;A temporary but powerful surge in ion flow could occur when tortuous and resistant neural pathways are suddenly replaced by new, free-flowing ones. This sudden increase in ion flow could be the trigger that precipitates a break-through, from subconscious to consciousness, of the newly found solution. Such a surge could also cause a release of emotion-creating chemicals, as well as excite portions of the visual network generating lights and other images.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution’s presentation, the instant it passes from subconscious to consciousness, may seem to be inexplicable, to artists, scientists and religionists. Some may see it as a divine act, and its nature may be such as to precipitate a self-induced religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Mystical experiences are only mystical because we do not understand how they might be produced. Our understanding of such phenomena is progressing, however. Experiments that induce oxygen starvation of the brain (i.e., a biochemical event) can replicate similar perceptions. Subjects reported seeing bright lights, colours, landscapes and people; hearing noises ranging from roaring to screaming; having out-of-body sensations; and feeling emotions of peace, detachment and pleasure—all of which made the subjects resist returning to consciousness, and all clearly fabricated within and by the brain or mind. (This investigation was carried out by doctors from the neurological department of the University Clinic Rudolf Virchow, Berlin, reported in 1994 in the British medical journal, ''The Lancet'' [and reviewed in ''The Ottawa Citizen'' on 24 September, 1994].)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
M. A. Persinger and the Neuroscience Research Group at Laurentian University in Canada, have induced “near-death” and “mystical” experiences (with subjects reporting images of tunnels, lights, faces and figures) by subjecting volunteers to weak, transcerebral magnetic fields. As we learned in physics class, a changing magnetic field creates electrical currents in conductors, and neurons (which contain electrically charged chemical ions) act as electrical conductors. Thus, changing magnetic fields around the brain will induce random biochemical flows through neurons, activating stored memories but in distorted fashion. These are then interpreted by the mind to be the events as reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See also “A qualitative and quantitative study of the incidence, features and aetiology of near death experiences in cardiac arrest survivors,” ''Resuscitation'', Vol. 48 (2) (2001) 149-156, for a clinical discussion of experiences similar to those described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(“Out-of-body” and other sensations formerly considered to be mystical, can also be repeatedly induced by electrically stimulating the right angular gyrus; see Olaf Blanke, et al., “Stimulating own-body perceptions,” ''Nature'', 419, 2002, 269-270.)&lt;/ref&gt;

What had taken so long to discover, comes, seemingly, from the unknown.&lt;ref&gt;The feeling of “being one with the universe,” such as reported by some mystics, artists, scientists, religious persons, and individuals after meditating, also suggests that first-level impressions can be accessed at the conscious third-level of thought under suitable conditions. Cassirer, in ''Language and Myth'', provides the clue. Pre-linguistic awareness, or mythic understanding, occurs when the brain receives stimuli from our senses with no interpretation. The whole appears just as it is, to the best of our senses’ receiving capabilities. No pre-conceived, language-derived interpretations add to, or subtract from, the awareness. However, this un-analyzed impression hardly ever penetrates through to our consciousness, because we use words in third-level thinking, and words represent what we think to be true, not what is actually true (see [[../../Thinking/Third-Level Thinking And Language|Third-Level Thinking And Language]]). When we feel “united” with the universe, we are actually united with our brain’s impression of the universe (although even this is filtered through our senses and limited by their sensibilities). Feelings of grandeur, exultation, immense joy and certainty are all likely to accompany this uncommon and profound experience. The conscious mind cannot in retrospect explain what happened, but it does perceive its significance. (Emotionally strong experiences are often extremely important, particularly those that re-route significant construct linkages.)&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, the solution appears flawless—all of the pieces fit perfectly and make a unified whole. While the solution may not yet contain answers to all the questions that will likely come later, the individual knows instinctively and emotionally, as well as rationally, that this new-found solution will be able to provide them. Every part of the experience is magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the found solution may be completely wrong. While the discovered solution is often accurate (for it is the result of much prior thought, both conscious and subconscious, by individuals well versed in their discipline), it can be erroneous, even for such individuals. The intense feelings and instant conviction experienced bear no relation to the truth of what is newly thought to be the answer. The solution always feels right, and it is right for the particular mind-set of constructs that conceived it. And it is also right in that it reduces energy consumption and stress. But the answer may be entirely false, and always will be, if the individual has had only incorrect knowledge or false assumptions to work with. Kepler’s experiences can serve to illustrate the effect of working with unsound knowledge. Kepler (an extremely careful, sixteenth century mathematician and astronomer) deduced, via mathematical investigations into the properties of regular solid figures,&lt;ref&gt;The cone, pyramid, sphere, cube, cylinder and prism analyzed in a branch of mathematics known as solid geometry.&lt;/ref&gt; that there could only be six planets. (Of course, there are more than six planets, but no one knew this at that time.) Kepler was immediately filled with “great joy,”&lt;ref&gt;Max Caspar, translated and edited by C. Doris Hellman, ''Kepler'' (London and New York: Abelard-Schumann, 1959), 65.&lt;/ref&gt; because he believed that he had discovered one of God’s mysteries.

The experiences related above demonstrate that hours of conscious, troublesome, problem-solving attempts usually preceded revelations. Since this kind of activity induces accompanying hours of stress-relieving, subconscious, mental activity, the most logical explanation for revelations (and the religious conversions that sometimes follow) is that they stem from this work amid the memories stored within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;A solution to any problem clearly cannot come to a mind not prepared to receive it. A prepared mind knows something about the problem’s environment and is ready to notice that a problem exists. For example, a new scientific understanding can never be actualized by a non-scientific person, no matter how brilliant he or she may be, because, even if such a solution somehow did arise, the event would pass by unrecognized for what it was. For the same reason, an uninitiated member of an isolated tribe, for example, could never experience a conversion to a missionary’s religion: whenever conversions occur, they follow, never precede, indoctrination.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an appropriate place to review a few of the major points discussed so far in Parts One and Two.

The brain’s chief function is to receive information detected by the body’s sensors and to analyze and redirect this information so that the body acts in a manner that best enables it to survive and reproduce.

Chunks of knowledge, experiences, thoughts, past emotions, etc., are stored in the brain as memories within neural networks, much like information is stored in computers as patterns in memory chips and on hard drives. The human mind accesses these memories both consciously and subconsciously.

The mind evolved as the “problem-solving software” of a brain that had to manage an increasingly complex body. (The body’s abilities became more complex over time as survival-enhancing mutations added structures upon existing structures. See [[../../Life/Development Of Life On Earth|Development Of Life On Earth]] and [[../../Life And Exploiting/Complexity, Intelligence And Evolution|Complexity, Intelligence And Evolution]] for an elaboration of this phenomenon.)

The mind survives because it helps the body to survive. It does this by searching for and recognizing relationships between memories and stimuli from body sensors, then creating an awareness of alternative courses of action.

The universe’s causality has led its inhabitants to think (to the extent that they possess this capability) and act rationally. This ability began, and will continue (evolving as it does so), because those behaving in this manner are more likely to survive and reproduce than those who ignore its importance.

Solutions to everyday problems can only be found by consulting the environment presenting the problem situation. The criteria needed to draft and select rational solutions are always obtained from that environment. This environment can be the real universe, or it can be a social, cultural, artificial or other environment, including the private mental mind-set created by the blend of constructs each individual develops during his or her lifetime.

A purpose, attainable in the environment presenting the problem, must be valued and sought before a solution can be rationally chosen (i.e., a decision made) and “meaningful” action taken.

Language tremendously expedited the transfer of knowledge and understanding between generations. It has made humans the most adaptable species on this planet and it has accelerated the growth of their intelligence. However, language also allows us to expound metaphysical problems devoid of real world context. Such problems cannot be solved without first defining some appropriate metaphysical environment; furthermore, meaningful decisions cannot be made even within this environment without first defining and valuing a purpose.

Religions declare purposes and describe accompanying environments. These conceptions exist entirely and only within the minds of believers, and differ widely throughout the world. In effect, religions provide an environment where otherwise-unanswerable metaphysical questions such as, “what is the point of living/what is the meaning of life?” may be answered. This environment contains solutions and criteria to be used by believers when making a decision or choice. The religion’s goal (or purpose) is said to be attainable by anyone who chooses to live mentally within that environment. This purpose, once valued, is then used to assess options, make moral decisions or judgements, and regulate behaviour. (A similar effect is created when individuals adopt and conform to the behavioural standards defined by their social environment.)

“Revelations” occur when the results of subconscious, second-level, stress-relieving thinking break through into conscious thought. This phenomenon is accompanied by emotions of excitement, wonder and joy, chemically generated as the stress-induced tensions are released.

“Conversions” of any kind, religious or secular, and whether externally or self-induced (by way of a revelation), occur when one all-encompassing Construct connects or re-connects, then supersedes, numerous formerly poorly integrated neural constructs. The new Construct profoundly affects the thinking, decision making, and behaviour of the affected individual.

The intensity of self-induced revelations, the instant relief from stress they provide and the seemingly perfect answers they offer create conditions that convince recipient individuals that this is “the truth.” Such individuals often become close-minded in their way of interpreting information and firmly believe&lt;ref&gt;If belief can arrive only through an instance of surrendered rationality (see [[../../Making Decisions/Moral Decisions|Moral Decisions]]), then this explains why many intelligent men and women have trouble believing in a god or accepting the dogma of a religion. Intelligence and rationality are intimately linked, and the mind invariably resists onslaughts to its rationality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This also suggests that many people professing “belief” must actually be relying upon “faith.” Faith is weaker than belief because it can be shaken. In other words, the construct built by faith retains ties to the rational world, whereas the construct that harbours belief has severed all such ties. It is faith’s ties to rationality that create the need for periodic boostings; true believers have no such requirement.&lt;/ref&gt; that their mind-set is the only correct way to think.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans have built, nurtured and developed religions of various kinds for millennia. Primitive people venerated animals, snakes, birds, plants and insects, as well as the more usual mystical gods. Forms of astrology and magic often accompanied and added complexity to their beliefs. The sun, moon and stars, human ancestors, imaginary demons and spirits, have all been thrown into the mix to flavor religious philosophies at one time or another&lt;ref&gt;See Noss, ''Man’s Religions''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past twenty five centuries or so, the number of major religions has contracted to nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''World Christian Encyclopaedia'', there are nineteen major world religions. These can be subdivided into 270 groups, which can be further subdivided into many others. (For instance, there are some 34,000 different Christian subgroups.) David Barrett et al, Eds., ''World Christian Encyclopaedia: A comparative survey of churches and religions – AD 30 to 2000'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; However, each one of these includes many variations (Protestantism, for example, acknowledges over seventy), and each variation can be further subcategorized many times. In addition, an incredible number of minor cults lie half-hidden in the cities, towns, villages and backwoods of many nations. Society still has Satanism, voodoo, animism, warlocks and witches, all seeking (and finding, if occasional newspaper reports are to be believed) receptive audiences to extend their influence. In total, humans probably support a million or so different religions—and the number increases each year.&lt;ref&gt;See Toby Lester, “Oh, Gods!” in ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Vol. 289, No. 2, February, 2002, 37-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

This chapter presents a brief overview of five principal religions, summarizes some of their commonalities and ends with a list of issues that, in my opinion, devalue their utility. It is necessarily a very cursory glance at only a few of their most obvious features; doubtless many readers will be able to add much that has been left out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over half of the world’s population claim to be either Christian (over 2 billion), Muslim (about 1.2 billion), or Hindu (nearly 0.8 billion).&lt;ref&gt;A number of sources have been invaluable in researching this chapter: ''Microsoft Encarta DVD-ROM Reference Suite 99''. Microsoft Corporation; Noss, ''Man’s Religions''; Chris Richards, general editor, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Religions'' (Shaftesbury, Dorset: Element Books Limited, 1997), and a variety of web sites. The statistics were taken from the ''World Christian Encyclopaedia''. Another source for statistics is globalchristianity.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists number over 0.3 billion. No other religion is supported by more than 200 million people, with most other doctrines claiming just a few million. Surprisingly, the founding monotheistic religion, Judaism, reports less than twenty million adherents. By way of comparison, over 0.9 billion people state that they do not follow a religion of any sort, and more than 0.2 billion call themselves atheists and deny the existence of any god.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The basis of the Christian faith is the belief that a historical person who lived in the first century of the Common Era (CE), Jesus of Nazareth, was and is the &quot;Christ&quot; (from the Greek meaning &quot;the one anointed&quot; (by God)). This means, in Christian belief, that Jesus is both a human person and God incarnate. 

The significance of the incarnation is that through his acceptance of human life and death by execution, and especially his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ liberates all of creation from the power of evil. Even more, Christians believe that Christ's resurrection allows any individual to become united to God in a way that was not possible before that event.

As God, Christ (Jesus) is understood specifically to be one of three interrelated facets or (somewhat misleadingly) &quot;persons&quot; of the divine. God is thus very frequently referred to as the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;, being the Father, Son (i.e. Christ) and Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is understood to be spiritually present in all things and as a result intimately accessible to every person.

Understanding the historical and theological context of the life of Jesus is very important to understanding the Christian faith. In particular, Jesus was a Jew, and framed his teachings in terms that accorded with the cultural environment of first-century Judaism. This is not considered accidental by Christians: rather, they believe that Jesus is the fulfillment of the teachings and prophecies of the Jewish faith: in Jewish terms, he is the Messiah. For Christians, the Jewish scriptures (especially the Psalms and the books of the prophets) give substantial support to this contention.

Much more important to most Christians than the Jewish scriptures (which are collectively referred to by Christians as the &quot;Old Testament&quot;) is a shorter collection of works compiled in the decades following Christ's resurrection. This &quot;New Testament&quot; consists mainly of accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus and letters to early Christian communities and individuals. Christians' attitudes toward the New Testament vary greatly, but almost all would agree that it is a principal source for their knowledge of Christ.

Another basic source, at least for those known as Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians, is the accumulated tradition of the Christian Church. That view of the importance of tradition is closely linked to those Christians' understanding of the Church itself, which differs significantly from the understanding held by most of those known as Protestant Christians. Very briefly, the Catholic and Orthodox ascribe to the Church a more directive and more authoritative function than do Protestants, who instead tend to emphasize the importance of individual decision-making in both doctrinal and institutional matters.

One point on which virtually all Christians agree is that their faith is not, despite the way it is often misrepresented in modern popular culture, simply a set of rules for moral living. The teachings of Jesus have important ethical components, and Christians are expected to live up to high standards of personal and social behavior. But it is the personal transformation of the individual that is the goal; in New Testament terms, the realization that &quot;the Kingdom of Heaven is within you&quot; (alternatively translated &quot;among you&quot;).

Similarly, Christianity is often dismissed as being about &quot;pie in the sky when we die&quot; -- that is, a promise that following certain rules in this life will buy an eternal life in heaven after death, and a threat that failing to follow the rules (&quot;sinning&quot;) will condemn one to eternal torment in hell. This view of God as an implacable, rule-bound judge is especially common in those cultures where the dominant form of Christianity has been the &quot;Western&quot; (Catholic and/or Protestant) form, but it is not a fair characterization even of those traditions. Rather, Christians of all kinds understand God more as a perfectly loving parent, and sin more as a sort of self-imposed illness. Indeed, one early Christian prayer addresses God as &quot;the physician of our souls and bodies&quot;.

The global spread of Christianity is objectively attributable to several factors, not least the success of European cultures in subjugating and displacing many of the world's indigenous cultures. Even before the age of colonialism, however, Christianity experienced a remarkable dispersion. For example, among the earliest Christian communities are those in Ethiopia and Armenia. Early missions also reached China and India in the East, and Ireland in the West. This expansion reflects the importance in the Christian religion of &quot;evangelism&quot;, or spreading the faith.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Founded in Arabia by Muhammad early in the seventh century, Islam spread rapidly following Muhammad’s death in 632. During the Dark Ages, Islamic scientists, philosophers and physicians formed the intellectual centre of the world. Islam’s growth and dominance declined following the First Crusade (called by Pope Urban II), when a rabble of mostly Western European Christian armies took Jerusalem in 1099. (Jerusalem was regained for Islam in 1187 by the Muslim prince Saladin.)

Islam is practised today by approximately one-fifth of the world’s population. Muslims state that Muhammad was the last and greatest of many thousands of prophets.&lt;ref&gt;A total of 124,000 prophets, starting with Adam, see ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Religions'', 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that all prophets were human and all were passing Allah’s words to humankind, that all prophets are therefore Muslim, and that only Islam is acceptable to Allah.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the Koran (or Qur’an) contains Allah’s revelations to Muhammad and is therefore infallible. Because the sections of the Koran were memorized and written down by many followers and recorded in full shortly after Muhammad’s death it has retained its integrity over the years. The Koran teaches forgiveness, but allows punishment of wrongdoers. Martyrs who die in a jihad, or holy war, are assured a place in paradise.

A second significant source of Islamic doctrine is the Hadith literature, which describes what Muhammad did or said in particular circumstances. This text is not deemed to be infallible; it teaches that individuals should live to benefit humanity, and not live to seek immediate or future pleasure.
 
According to Islam, Allah created and sustains the universe and all within. Nature is subservient to, and may be exploited by, mankind. Mankind is in the service of Allah, must worship Him, and must construct a social order that is ethical and free from corruption. As in Christianity, Muslims believe that there will be a Day of Judgement, when all humanity will be judged, with some going to the Garden or heaven, and others going to hell. In the meantime, “virtuous” nations are granted license to judge and punish “corrupt” nations.

Muslims are forbidden to eat the flesh of swine or to drink alcohol, and must adhere to the &quot;five pillars.&quot; They must publicly profess their faith at least once in their life. They must pray five times each day, give alms or charity, fast from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, and, if physically and economically able, make at least one pilgrimage to the Kaaba at Mecca. Men should cover their midsection and are forbidden to wear silk or gold jewellery. Women should cover their whole body, except for hands, feet and face. Men may have up to four wives but each must be treated equitably and justly. Women can initiate divorce. Possessions pass equally to all children. Racial equality is stressed, and the practice of different religions is allowed.

Islam is a way of life that covers all aspects of living. Its principles govern personal, social, political and economic thought and action with no aspect neglected. Consequently Islamic law contains and defines both legal and moral obligations, and several Islamic nations do not separate church from state. This practice has fostered the growth of Islamism (whose slogan is, “Islam is religion and State”). Islamists, a minority group of avid fundamentalists, particularly oppose “Western morality,” and believe that modernization has resulted in the breakdown of traditional family, societal, and religious values. They strive for a global theocracy and are not above using terrorism to achieve their ends. Moderate Muslims seem powerless to counter this activity from within Islam and any attempt to do so from without is regarded as an attack upon the Islamic faith. Perhaps for this reason outsiders often see Islam as an aggressive and ruthless religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hinduism, existing in India for some 5,000 years, has influenced many other religions, and has itself absorbed an enormous variety of beliefs and practices. These shape and colour every aspect of its very intricate metaphysics. Today, Hindus show more uniformity in their behaviour than in their beliefs; however, very few practices are universal to all.

The principal Hindu textual authorities are the three Vedas (the Rig-veda, whose content reaches back to the birth of Hinduism, the Yajur-veda, and the Sama-veda). These books are considered to be revelations about the Supreme Being (Brahman, who is said to be the source and ultimate reality of everything) and are not to be altered in any manner. A fourth veda, the Atharva-veda, is of lesser importance. There are many other Hindu sources of information, particularly the Brahmanas (rituals and myths) and the Upanishads (mystical meditations on the universe and meaning in life), however these authorities are too erudite for most Hindus to comprehend. Practical Hinduism is found in the Smriti (which is allowed to be modified, and which includes epics), many Puranas, and textbooks on sacred law.

Hindu beliefs include the notions that the universe contains many concentric heavens and hells (with India positioned at the centre), that time is both degenerative and cyclical, and that the universe is being intermittently destroyed and reborn. Many Hindus believe the soul leaves the body after death, to be reborn as another person, animal, vegetable, or other entity, with the “level” of rebirth being determined by past actions. Only continuously striving to improve both body and soul and the renunciation of all worldly desires can merit release from this endless recycling. Few Hindus actively seek this ideal. However, the pursuit of this goal has produced two distinct metaphysical and social systems.

“Worldly” Hindus live within an intricate, hierarchical, caste system that binds society and gives each person an identity and purpose. Born into a particular caste, each person is destined to perform certain appropriate duties—to marry within their caste, to raise a son, and to eat traditional food, for instance. Thus, for worldly Hindus, the key concepts of their philosophies are relationships, harmony and detachment or peace—not religion or a concern related to their god’s requirements for them. “Non-worldly” Hindus (who renounce the world) attempt to unite their individual soul with that of Brahman, the universal soul. Many of their practices (such as vegetarianism) have been incorporated into worldly Hinduism.

Each Hindu community is responsible for erecting and supporting a temple which it then manages. Most Hindus worship one of the male gods, Shiva or Vishnu, or the goddess Devi. However, they may just as readily worship any of hundreds of minor gods, some of whom can be particular to just one village or family.

Social ceremonial occasions include birth, the first time rice is eaten, first male haircut, purification after first menstruation, marriage, pregnancy blessings, cremation, sprinkling funeral ashes in a holy river, and annual ancestral offerings. Less-public daily ceremonials include chanting a hymn to the sun at dawn, and making offerings to the household shrine, or to special garden or village objects. Temples vary from small stone boxes to complex temple cities. Priests offer prayers at sunrise, attend their god, give food remnants to those worshipping, and perform sunset rituals. Processions are normally held each year to carry the god image around the temple, and goats may be sacrificed on special occasions. Numerous colourful and vibrant festivals are held annually, with some allowing all castes to mingle freely. Periodically, individuals (usually male) and, less commonly, entire families make pilgrimages to holy places, often walking hundreds of kilometres en masse to fulfill vows, to seek blessings or give thanks for those received, and to collect water for the household shrine.

Despite its multiple gods, variety in religious expression, diversity and apparent contradictions, the Hindu society flourishes and continues to attract converts, perhaps, in part, because central to its teachings is the universal desire to satisfy the human striving for Shanti, or peace of mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Buddhism is based upon the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama,&lt;ref&gt;Now considered to have lived from 448-368 BCE (formerly thought to be 563-483 BC).&lt;/ref&gt; known as Buddha, or Enlightened One. Born (circa 563 BC) a Hindu and raised as a prince of a small kingdom in Kapilavastu in Nepal, Gautama abdicated at 29 to lead an ascetic life and to practice Yoga. After doing so for six years he adopted a middle path between indulgence and self-denial, meditated, and eventually attained enlightenment. He then preached in various places, and subsequently formed a community of disciples.

Buddha is thought to have been a contemporary of the Jain founder Mahavira, and some scholars have suggested that they may have shared a common ascetic teacher, or guru. Buddhism and Jainism share many  common themes and practices, including an emphasis on nonviolence and a belief that one achieves liberation through the renunciation of worldly ties which bind individuals to illusion through the process of karma, the accumulation of good and bad merit.

While Buddha retained some of the philosophical and cosmological structures of traditional Hinduism, like reincarnation and polytheism, he rejected other Hindu beliefs and practices, particularly the veracity of the Vedas, animal sacrifice, and the caste system. The Buddha's use of Hindu philosophical and cosmological terms should not be viewed as his religious endorsement of such views. To the contrary, Buddha explicitly made such ideas subservient to his fundamental teaching of the truth, or Dharma. Any person who finds such ideas an obstacle to understanding the Dharma is urged to renounce them.

The foundation of the Dharma is the “Four Noble Truths”: (1) that life is suffering, (2) caused by ignorance, (3) to be overcome by wisdom and compassion, (4) achievable by following the “Noble Eightfold Path.” The &quot;Eightfold Path&quot; espouses right (1) views, (2) intention, (3) speech, (4) action, (5) livelihood, (6) effort, (7) right-mindedness, and (8) contemplation. In turn, these are often grouped into three categories: wisdom, morality and concentration.

Any sentient being can, though its own efforts, become a Buddha. Buddhist mythology includes countless Buddhas, each presiding over their own universe in the past and future.

Records of Buddha’s actual teachings were not written until around the first century BCE, several hundred years after his death. During the intervening years, the unity of Buddha’s teachings was maintained by councils of monks who met (four times in five hundred years) to agree upon proper monastic discipline and what should be taught. Disagreements in early years led to eighteen schools of thought and caused many splits. Today two main forms survive, Theravada (which holds Buddha to be mortal), and Mahayana (which holds Buddha to exist in three forms, one immortal).

Generally speaking, Buddhists believe that individuals are composed of five, constantly changing “bundles,” which are comprised of feelings, perceptions, predispositions, consciousness, and the material body. Since this constant bundle-changing precludes the possibility of a soul (atman), the causal reincarnation link is attributed to ignorance, thoughts and sensations. Buddhists also believe in karma, whereby each act has an ethical consequence that brings punishment or reward during life, and which can determine the outcome of reincarnation. Being charitable, non-materialistic and unselfishly kind, having compassion for all, supporting the monasteries, not killing or stealing, avoiding alcohol and harmful language and not sexually misbehaving are considered to be correct behaviours. Reincarnation can only be halted through attaining the enlightened state of Nirvana.

Theravada Buddhism is most widespread in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, and is returning, via the Untouchable caste, to India. Mahayana Buddhism is dominant (in a variety of forms) in the rest of the Buddhist world, principally China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Central Asia, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

Theravada claims to be perpetuating the true teachings and practices of Siddhartha Gautama, and traces its descent from the original monastic community. The Theravadin ideal is to become an arhat, i.e., in a disciplined manner, attempt to manipulate their dharmas (a complexity of transient aspects that comprise the human existence) in order to suspend karma and thereby achieve Nirvana. Only monks can attain Nirvana, but the laity may hope to be reborn as monks after many reincarnations. Women and laity enjoy only limited participation in the monastic life.

Mahayana doctrine (originating between the second century BC and the first century Ad) holds that Buddha has a triple body-form: essence, bliss and transformation. “Essence” represents the absolute, which manifests itself in heavenly form as communal “bliss,” and which appears on Earth as “transformation.” (Siddhartha Gautama is held to have been such a transformation.) Mahayana Buddhism teaches that the true nature of all things is emptiness, and that this concept can be used in meditation.

Mahayana Buddhists believe that any individual can attempt to reach the stage of perfect enlightenment (bodhisattva). Of those reaching this state, some then choose to delay their entry into Nirvana in order to transfer merit to others through acts of compassion and loving kindness. (Mahayanists therefore consider the bodhisattva state to be higher than that of the Theravadin's arhat—who have more care for themselves than they do for others. As a result Mahayanists can revere bodhisattvas as deities during their lifetime.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Inheritance''' is the extension of a class.  A child class has all the properties and methods of its parent class.  For example, pets generally share similar characteristics, regardless of what type of animal they are.  Pets eat, and sleep, and can be given names.  However the different types of pet also have their own methods: dogs bark and cats meow.  Below is an implementation of this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
class Pet
{
   var $_name;

   function Pet($name)
   {
      $this-&gt;_name = $name;
   }

   function eat()
   {
   }

   function sleep()
   {
   }
}

class Dog extends Pet
{
   function bark()
   {
   }
}

class Cat extends Pet
{
   function meow()
   {
   }
}

$dog = new Dog(&quot;Max&quot;);
$dog-&gt;eat();
$dog-&gt;bark();
$dog-&gt;sleep();

$cat = new Cat(&quot;Misty&quot;);
$cat-&gt;eat();
$cat-&gt;meow();
$cat-&gt;sleep();
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Likewise we could use the PHP5 syntax for our inherited class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
class Pet
{
   var $_name

   public function __construct($name)
   {
      $this-&gt;_name = $name;
   }

   function eat()
   {
   }

   function sleep()
   {
   }
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sars. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sars~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;''The way of the java''&lt;/big&gt;

The goal of this book, and this class, is to teach you to think like a
computer scientist.  I like the way computer scientists think because
they combine some of the best features of Mathematics, Engineering,
and Natural Science.  Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal
languages to denote ideas (specifically computations).  Like
engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and
evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives.  Like scientists,
they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test
predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is 
problem-solving.  By that I mean the ability to formulate problems,
think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and
accurately.  As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills.  That's why
this chapter is called ''The way of the program.''

On one level, you will be learning to program, which is a useful
skill by itself.  On another level you will use programming
as a means to an end.  As we go along, that end will
become clearer.

==What is a programming language?==

The programming language you will be learning is [http://www.javasoft.com Java], which is
relatively new (Sun released the first version in May, 1995).  Java is
an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages
you might have heard of are C, C++, Pascal, and FORTRAN.

As you might infer from the name ''high-level language,'' there are
also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine
language or assembly language.  Loosely-speaking, computers can only
execute programs written in low-level languages.  Thus, programs
written in a high-level language have to be translated before they can
run.  This translation takes some time, which is a small disadvantage
of high-level languages.

But the advantages are enormous.  First,
it is much easier to program in a high-level language;
by ''easier'' I mean that the program takes less time to write,
it's shorter and easier to read, and it's more likely to be
correct.  Secondly, high-level languages are portable,
meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with
few or no modifications.  Low-level programs can only run
on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run on
another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in
high-level languages.  Low-level languages are only used for
a few special applications.

===Compilation vs interpretation===

There are two ways to translate a program;
interpreting or compiling.  An interpreter
is a program that reads a high-level program
and does what it says.  In effect, it translates
the program line-by-line, alternately reading lines and
carrying out commands.  Examples of interpreted languages 
are BASIC, Perl, and Python.

A compiler is a program that reads a high-level program and
translates it all at once, before executing any of the commands.
Often you compile the program as a separate step, and then
execute the compiled code later.  In this case, the high-level
program is called the source code, and the translated
program is called the executable.

As an example, suppose you write a program in C.  You might
use a text editor to write the program (a text editor is
a simple word processor).  When the program is finished, you
might save it in a file named program.c, where ''program''
is an arbitrary name you make up, and the suffix .c is
a convention that indicates that the file contains C source
code.

Then, depending on what your programming environment is like,
you might leave the text editor and run the compiler.  The
compiler would read your source code, translate it, and create
a new file named program.o to contain the object code,
or program.exe to contain the executable.

===The Java platform===

The Java language is unusual because it is both compiled and
interpreted.  Instead of translating Java programs into
machine language, the Java compiler generates Java byte code.
Byte code is easy (and fast) to interpret, like machine language,
but it is also portable, like a high-level language.  Thus,
it is possible to compile a Java program on one machine,
transfer the byte code to another machine over a network,
and then interpret the byte code on the other machine.  This
ability is one of the advantages of Java over many other
high-level languages.

Although this process may seem complicated, the good news is that in
most programming environments (sometimes called development
environments), these steps are automated for you.  Usually you will
only have to write a program and type a single command to compile and
run it.  On the other hand, it is useful to know what the steps are
that are happening in the background, so that if something goes wrong
you can figure out what it is.

==What is a program?==

A program's source code contains a sequence of instructions that
specifies how to perform a computation.  The computation might be
something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding
the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation,
like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough)
compiling a program.

The instructions (or commands, or statements) look different in
different programming languages, but there are a few basic functions
that appear in just about every language:

*'''input'''&amp;mdash;Get data from the keyboard, or a file, or some other device.

*'''output'''&amp;mdash;Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.

*'''math'''&amp;mdash;Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.

*'''testing'''&amp;mdash;Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.

*'''repetition'''&amp;mdash;Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it.
Every program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is
made up of functions that look more or less like these.  Thus,
one way to describe programming is the process of breaking a
large, complex task up into smaller and smaller subtasks
until eventually the subtasks are simple enough to be performed
with one of these simple functions.



==What is debugging?==

Programming is a complex process, and since it is done by
human beings, it often leads to errors.  For whimsical reasons,
programming errors are called bugs and the process
of tracking them down and correcting them is called
debugging.

There are a few different kinds of errors that can occur
in a program, and it is useful to distinguish between them
in order to track them down more quickly.

===Compile-time errors===

The compiler can only translate a program if the program is
syntactically correct; otherwise, the compilation fails and
you will not be able to run your program.  Syntax
refers to the structure of your program and the rules about
that structure.

===Syntax===

For example, in English, a sentence must begin with a capital
letter and end with a period.  this sentence contains a syntax
error.  So does this one

For most readers, a few syntax errors are not a significant
problem, which is why we can read the poetry of E. E. Cummings
without spewing error messages.

Compilers are not so forgiving.  If there is a single syntax
error anywhere in your program, the compiler will print an
error message and quit, and you will not be able to run
your program.

To make matters worse, there are more syntax rules in Java
than there are in English, and the error messages you get from
the compiler are often not very helpful.  During the first
few weeks of your programming career, you will probably
spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors.  As you
gain experience, though, you will make fewer errors and find
them faster.

===Run-time errors===

The second type of error is a run-time error, so-called because
the error does not appear until you run the program.  In Java,
run-time errors occur when the interpreter is running the byte
code and something goes wrong.

The good news for now is that Java tends to be a safe
language, which means that run-time errors are rare, especially
for the simple sorts of programs we will be writing for the
next few weeks.

Later on in the semester, you will probably start to see more
run-time errors, especially when we start talking about objects
and references (Chapter objects).

In Java, run-time errors are called exceptions,
and in most environments they appear as windows or dialog
boxes that contain information about what happened and what
the program was doing when it happened.  This information is
useful for debugging.

===Logic errors and semantics===

The third type of error is the logical or semantic
error.  If there is a logical error in your program, it will
compile and run successfully, in the sense that the computer
will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the
right thing.  It will do something else.  Specifically, it will
do what you told it to do.

The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program
you wanted to write.  The meaning of the program (its semantics)
is wrong.  Identifying logical errors can be tricky, since
it requires you to work backwards by looking at the output
of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.

===Experimental debugging===

One of the most important skills you will acquire in this
class is debugging.  Although it can be frustrating, debugging
is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and
interesting parts of programming.

In some ways debugging is like detective work.  You are
confronted with clues and you have to infer the processes
and events that lead to the results you see.

Debugging is also like an experimental science.  Once you have an idea
what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again.  If your
hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the
modification, and you take a step closer to a working program.  If
your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.  As
Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
(from A. Conan Doyle's The Sign of Four).

 Holmes, Sherlock
 Doyle, Arthur Conan

For some people, programming and debugging are the
same thing.  That is, programming is the process of gradually
debugging a program until it does what you want.  The idea
is that you should always start with a working program that
does something, and make small modifications, debugging
them as you go, so that you always have a working program.

For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of
lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds
used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.  According to Larry Greenfield,
“One of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would switch
between printing AAAA and BBBB.  This later evolved to Linux”
(from The Linux Users' Guide Beta Version 1).

In later chapters I will make more suggestions about debugging
and other programming practices.

==Formal languages vs. natural languages==

Natural languages are the languages that people speak,
like English, Spanish, and French.  They were not designed
by people (although people try to impose some order on them);
they evolved naturally.

Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for
specific applications.  For example, the notation that mathematicians
use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting
relationships among numbers and symbols.  Chemists use a formal
language to represent the chemical structure of molecules.  Likewise,
programming languages are formal languages that have been
designed to express computations.

When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal
language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is
(although in a natural language you do this subconsciously).  This
process is called '''[[w:parsing|parsing]]'''.

For example, when you hear the sentence, “The other shoe fell,” you
understand that “the other shoe” is the subject and “fell” is the
verb.  Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it
means, that is, the semantics of the sentence.  Assuming that you know
what a shoe is, and what it means to fall, you will understand the
general implication of this sentence.

Although formal and natural languages have many features in
common(tokens, structure, syntax and semantics, etc.), there are many
differences:

*'''ambiguity''' Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.

*'''redundancy''' In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy.  As a result, they are often verbose.  Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.

*'''literalness''' Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.  If I say, “The other shoe fell,” there is probably no shoe and nothing falling.  Formal languages mean exactly what they say.

People who grow up speaking a natural language (everyone) often have a
hard time adjusting to formal languages.  In some ways the difference
between formal and natural language is like the difference between
poetry and prose, but more so:

*'''Poetry''' Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response.  Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.

*'''Prose''' The literal meaning of words is more important and the structure contributes more meaning.  Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry, but still often ambiguous.

*'''Programs''' The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.

===Hints for reading programs===

Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal
languages).  First, remember that formal languages are much more dense
than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them.  Also, the
structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read
from top to bottom, left to right.  Instead, learn to parse the
program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the
structure.  Finally, remember that the details matter.  Little things
like spelling errors and bad punctuation, which you can get away
with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal
language.

==The first program==

''Hello, world!''

Traditionally the first program people write in a new language
is called ''Hello, World.'' because all it does is print the
words ''Hello, World.''  In Java, this program looks like this:

 class Hello
 {
   // main: generate some simple output
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world.&quot;);
   }
 }

Sometimes the quality of a programming language is judged by
the simplicity of the ''Hello, World.'' program.  By this
standard, Java does not do very well.  Even the simplest Java program
contains a number of features that are hard to explain to
beginning programmers.  We are going to ignore a lot of them
for now, but I will explain a few.

All programs are made up of class definitions, which have
the form:

===Classes===
 class CLASSNAME 
 {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      STATEMENTS
   }
 }

Here CLASSNAME indicates an arbitrary name that you make up.
The class name in the example is Hello.

===Static===
In the second line, you should ignore the words public static
void for now, but notice the word main.  main is a
special name that indicates the place in the program where execution
begins.  When the program runs, it starts by executing the first
statement in main and it continues, in order, until it gets
to the last statement, and then it quits.

===print===
There is no limit to the number of statements that can be in 
main, but the example contains only one.  It is a print
statement, meaning that it prints a message on the screen.  It is a
bit confusing that “print” sometimes means “display something on
the screen,” and sometimes means “send something to the printer.”
In this book I won't say much about sending things to the printer;
we'll do all our printing on the screen.

The command that prints things on the screen is
System.out.println, and the thing between the parentheses
is the thing that will get printed.  At the end of the statement
there is a semi-colon (;), which is required at the end
of every statement.

There are a few other things you should notice about the syntax
of this program.  First, Java uses squiggly-braces { and
} to group things together.  The outermost squiggly-braces
(lines 1 and 8) contain the class definition, and the inner
braces contain the definition of main.

===comment===
Also, notice that line 3 begins with //.  This indicates
that this line contains a comment, which is a bit of
English text that you can put in the middle of a program,
usually to explain what the program does.  When the compiler
sees a //, it ignores everything from there until the end
of the line.

In the first lab you will compile and run this program, and
also modify it in various ways in order to see what the
syntax rules are, and to see what error
messages the compiler generates when you violate one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==More printing==
As I mentioned in the last chapter, you can put as many
statements as you want in main.  For example, to
print more than one line:
 class Hello 
  // main: generate some simple output
  public static void main (String[] args) 
   System.out.println (&quot;Hello, world.&quot;);     // print one line
   System.out.println (&quot;How are you?&quot;);      // print another
Also, as you can see, it is legal to put comments at the
end of a line, as well as on a line by themselves.

==String==

The phrases that appear in quotation marks are called strings,
because they are made up of a sequence (string) of letters.  Actually,
strings can contain any combination of letters, numbers, punctuation
marks, and other special characters.

==newline==

println is short for ''print line,'' because after each
line it adds a special character, called a newline, that
causes the cursor to move to the next line of the display.
The next time println is invoked, the new text appears
on the next line.

Often it is useful to display the output from multiple print
statements all on one line.  You can do this with the print
command:

  class Hello 
    // main: generate some simple output
    public static void main (String[] args) 
      System.out.print (&quot;Goodbye, &quot;);
      System.out.println (&quot;cruel world!&quot;);

In this case the output appears on a single line as
Goodbye, cruel world!.  Notice that there is a space
between the word ''Goodbye'' and the second quotation mark.
This space appears in the output, so it affects the behavior
of the program.

Spaces that appear outside of quotation marks generally do
not affect the behavior of the program.  For example, I
could have written:

 class Hello 
 public static void main (String[] args) 
 System.out.print (&quot;Goodbye, &quot;);
 System.out.println (&quot;cruel world!&quot;);

This program would compile and run just as well as the original.
The breaks at the ends of lines (newlines) do not affect
the program's behavior either, so I could have written:

 class Hello  public static void main (String[] args) 
 System.out.print (&quot;Goodbye, &quot;); System.out.println
 (&quot;cruel world!&quot;);

That would work, too, although you have probably noticed that
the program is getting harder and harder to read.  Newlines and
spaces are useful for organizing your program visually, making
it easier to read the program and locate syntax errors.

==Variables==

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate variables.  A variable is a named location
that stores a value.  Values are things that can be printed and
stored and (as we'll see later) operated on.  The strings we have been
printing (&quot;Hello, World.&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, &quot;, etc.) are sequences of values.

In order to store a value, you have to create a variable.  Since
the values we want to store are strings, we will declare that
the new variable is a string:

    String fred;

This statement is a declaration, because it declares that
the variable named fred has the type String.  Each
variable has a type that determines what kind of values it
can store.  For example, the int type can store integers,
and it will probably come as no surprise that the String
type can store strings.

You may notice that some types begin with a capital letter and some
with lower-case.  Java is a case-sensitive language, so you should take care to get it right.

===declaration===
To create an integer variable, the syntax is int bob;,
where bob is the arbitrary name you made up for the
variable.  In general, you will want to make up variable names
that indicate what you plan to do with the variable.  For
example, if you saw these variable declarations:

 String firstName;
 String lastName;
 int hour, minute;

you could probably make a good guess at what values
would be stored in them.  This example
also demonstrates the syntax for declaring multiple variables
with the same type: hour and second
are both integers (int type).

===Assignment===
Now that we have created some variables, we would like to
store values in them.  We do that with an assignment
statement.

 fred = &quot;Hello.&quot;;     // give fred the value &quot;Hello.&quot;
 hour = 11;           // assign the value 11 to hour
 minute = 59;         // set minute to 59

This example shows three assignments, and the comments show
three different ways people sometimes talk about assignment
statements.  The vocabulary can be confusing here, but the
idea is straightforward:
*When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location.
*When you make an assignment to a variable, you give it a value.

As a general rule,
a variable has to have the same type as the
value you assign it.  You cannot store a String in minute or an
integer in fred.

On the other hand, that rule can be confusing, because there are many
ways that you can convert values from one type to another, and Java
sometimes converts things automatically.  So for now you should
remember the general rule, and we'll talk about special cases later.

Another source of confusion is that some strings look
like integers, but they are not.  For example, fred
can contain the string &quot;123&quot;, which is made up of the
characters 1, 2 and 3, but that is not
the same thing as the number 123.

 fred = &quot;123&quot;;     // legal
 fred = 123;       // not legal

===Printing variables===

You can print the value of a variable using the same commands
we used to print Strings.

 class Hello 
   public static void main (String[] args) 
     String firstLine;
     firstLine = &quot;Hello, again!&quot;;
     System.out.println (firstLine);

This program creates a variable named firstLine, assigns
it the value &quot;Hello, again!&quot; and then prints that value.
When we talk about ''printing a variable,'' we mean printing
the value of the variable.  To print the name of
a variable, you have to put it in quotes.
For example: System.out.println (&quot;firstLine&quot;);

If you want to get a little tricky, you could write

 String firstLine;
 firstLine = &quot;Hello, again!&quot;;
 System.out.print (&quot;The value of firstLine is &quot;);
 System.out.println (firstLine);

The output of this program is:

 The value of firstLine is Hello, again!

I am pleased to report that the syntax for printing a variable
is the same regardless of the variable's type.

 int hour, minute;
 hour = 11;
 minute = 59;
 System.out.print (&quot;The current time is &quot;);
 System.out.print (hour);
 System.out.print (&quot;:&quot;);
 System.out.print (minute);
 System.out.println (&quot;.&quot;);


The output of this program is 

 The current time is 11:59.

WARNING: It is common practice to use several print commands
followed by a println, in order to put multiple values
on the same line.  But you have to be careful to remember
the println at the end.  In many environments, the
output from print is stored without being displayed until
the println command is invoked, at which point the entire
line is displayed at once.  If you omit println, the
program may terminate without ever displaying the stored output!

===Keywords===

A few sections ago, I said that you can make up any name you
want for your variables, but that's not quite true.  There
are certain words that are reserved in Java because they are
used by the compiler to parse the structure of your program,
and if you use them as variable names, it will get confused.
These words, called keywords, include public,
class, void, int, and many more.

The complete list is available at
[http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/lexical.doc.html this Java doc].

Rather than memorize the list, I would suggest that you
take advantage of a feature provided in many Java development
environments: code highlighting.  As you type, different
parts of your program should appear in different colors.  For
example, keywords might be blue, strings red, and other code
black.  If you type a variable name and it turns blue, watch
out!  You might get some strange behavior from the compiler.

===Operators===

Operators are special symbols that are used to represent
simple computations like addition and multiplication.  Most
of the operators in Java do exactly what you would expect them
to do, because they are common mathematical symbols.  For
example, the operator for adding two integers is +.

The following are all legal Java expressions whose meaning is
more or less obvious:

 1+1 
 hour-1
 hour*60 + minute
 minute/60

Expressions can contain both variable
names and numbers.  In each case the name of the variable is
replaced with its value before the computation is performed.

====Int division====
Addition, subtraction and multiplication all do what you
expect, but you might be surprised by division.  For example,
the following program:

 int hour, minute;
 hour = 11;
 minute = 59;
 System.out.print (&quot;Number of minutes since midnight: &quot;);
 System.out.println (hour*60 + minute);
 System.out.print (&quot;Fraction of the hour that has passed: &quot;);
 System.out.println (minute/60);

would generate the following output:

 Number of minutes since midnight: 719
 Fraction of the hour that has passed: 0

The first line is what we expected, but the second line is
odd.  The value of the variable minute is 59, and
59 divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0.  The reason for the
discrepancy is that Java is performing integer division.

When both of the operands are integers (operands are the arguments of an instruction),
the result must also be an integer,
and by convention integer division always rounds down,
even in cases like this where the next integer is so close.

A possible alternative in this case is to calculate a percentage
rather than a fraction:

 System.out.print (&quot;Percentage of the hour that has passed: &quot;);
 System.out.println (minute*100/60);

The result is:

 Percentage of the hour that has passed: 98

Again the result is rounded down, but at least now the answer
is approximately correct.  In order to get an even more accurate
answer, we could use a different type of variable, called
floating-point, that is capable of storing fractional values.
We'll get to that in the next chapter.

===Order of operations===
 precedence
 order of operations

When more than one operator appears in an expression the order
of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence.  A
complete explanation of precedence can get complicated, but
just to get you started:

Multiplication and division take precedence (happen before)
addition and subtraction.  So 2*3-1 yields 5, not 4, and
2/3-1 yields -1, not 1 (remember that in integer division
2/3 is 0).

If the operators have the same precedence they are evaluated
from left to right.  So in the expression minute*100/60,
the multiplication happens first, yielding 5900/60, which
in turn yields 98.  If the operations had gone from right
to left, the result would be 59*1 which is 59, which
is wrong.

Any time you want to override the rules of precedence (or
you are not sure what they are) you can use parentheses.  Expressions
in parentheses are evaluated first, so 2 * (3-1) is 4.
You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to
read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even though it doesn't
change the result.

===Operators for Strings===

In general you cannot perform mathematical operations on Strings,
even if the strings look like numbers.  The following are
illegal (if we know that fred has type String)

 fred - 1
 &quot;Hello&quot;/123
 fred * &quot;Hello&quot;

By the way, can you tell by looking at those expressions
whether fred is an integer or a string?  Nope.
The only way to tell the type of a variable is to look at
the place where it is declared.

====concatenate====

Interestingly, the + operator does work with
Strings, although it does not do exactly what you might expect.
For Strings, the + operator represents concatenation,
which means joining up the two operands by linking them
end-to-end.  So &quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;world.&quot; yields the string
&quot;Hello, world.&quot; and fred + &quot;ism&quot; adds the suffix
ism to the end of whatever fred is, which is often
handy for naming new forms of bigotry.

===Composition===

So far we have looked at the elements of a programming
language---variables, expressions, and statements---in
isolation, without talking about how to combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages
is their ability to take small building blocks and
compose them.  For example, we know how to multiply
numbers and we know how to print; it turns out we can
do both at the same time:

 System.out.println (17 * 3);

Actually, I shouldn't say ''at the same time,'' since in reality
the multiplication has to happen before the printing, but
the point is that any expression, involving numbers, strings,
and variables, can be used inside a print statement.  We've
already seen one example:

 System.out.println (hour*60 + minute);

But you can also put arbitrary expressions on the right-hand
side of an assignment statement:

 int percentage;
 percentage = (minute * 100) / 60;

This ability may not seem so impressive now, but we will see
other examples where composition makes it possible
to express complex computations neatly and concisely.

WARNING: There are limits on where you can use certain
expressions; most notably, the left-hand side of an assignment
statement has to be a variable name, not an expression.
That's because the left side indicates the storage location
where the result will go.  Expressions
do not represent storage locations, only values.  So the
following is illegal:  minute+1 = hour;.

===Glossary===

*'''variable''' A named storage location for values.  All
variables have a type, which is declared when the variable
is created.
*'''value''' A number or string (or other thing to be named later)
that can be stored in a variable.  Every value belongs to
one type.
*'''type''' A set of values.  The type of a variable
determines which values can be stored there.  So far, the types
we have seen are integers (int in Java) and strings
(String in Java).
*'''keyword'''  A reserved word that is used by the compiler
to parse programs.  You cannot use keywords, like public,
class and void as variable names.
*'''statement''' A line of code that represents a command or
action.  So far, the statements we have seen are declarations,
assignments, and print statements.
*'''declaration''' A statement that creates a new variable and
determines its type.
*'''assignment''' A statement that assigns a value to a variable.
*'''expression''' A combination of variables, operators and
values that represents a single result value.  Expressions also
have types, as determined by their operators and operands.
*'''operator''' A special symbol that represents a simple
computation like addition, multiplication or string
concatenation.
*'''operand''' One of the values on which an operator operates. 
*'''precedence''' The order in which operations are evaluated.
*'''concatenate''' To join two operands end-to-end.
*'''composition''' The ability to combine simple
expressions and statements into compound statements and expressions
in order to represent complex computations concisely.

===Floating-point===

In the last chapter we had some problems dealing with numbers
that were not integers.  We worked around the problem by measuring
percentages instead of fractions, but a more general solution is
to use floating-point numbers, which can represent fractions
as well as integers.  In Java, the floating-point type is
called double.

You can create floating-point variables and assign values to them
using the same syntax we used for the other types.  For example:

 double pi;
 pi = 3.14159;

It is also legal to declare a variable and assign a value to it at the
same time:

 int x = 1;
 String empty = &quot;&quot;;
 double pi = 3.14159;

In fact, this syntax is quite common.  A combined declaration
and assignment is sometimes called an initialization.

===Initialization, conversion===

Although floating-point numbers are useful, they are
often a source of confusion because there seems to be an
overlap between integers and floating-point numbers.  For
example, if you have the value 1, is that an integer,
a floating-point number, or both?

Strictly speaking, Java distinguishes the integer value 1
from the floating-point value 1.0, even though they
seem to be the same number.  They belong to
different types, and strictly speaking, you are not allowed
to make assignments between types.  For example, the following
is illegal:

 int x = 1.1;

because the variable on the left is an int
and the value on the right is a float.  But it is easy
to forget this rule, especially because there are places where Java
will automatically convert from one type to another.
For example:

 double y = 1;

should technically not be legal, but Java allows it by converting the
int to a double automatically.  This leniency is
convenient, but it can cause problems; for example:

 double y = 1 / 3;

You might expect the variable y to be given the value
0.333333, which is a legal floating-point value, but in
fact it will get the value 0.0.  The reason is that the
expression on the right appears to be the ratio of two integers,
so Java does integer division, which yields the integer
value 0.  Converted to floating-point, the result is
0.0.

One way to solve this problem (once you figure out what
it is) is to make the right-hand side a floating-point
expression:

 double y = 1.0 / 3.0;

This sets y to 0.333333, as expected.

All the operations we have seen so far---addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division---also work on floating-point values,
although you might be interested to know that the underlying mechanism
is completely different.  In fact, most processors have special
hardware just for performing floating-point operations.

===Converting from double to int===

As I mentioned, Java converts ints
to doubles automatically if necessary, because no
information is lost in the translation.  On the other hand,
going from a double to an int requires rounding
off.  Java doesn't perform this operation automatically, in
order to make sure that you, as the programmer, are aware
of the loss of the fractional part of the number.

The simplest way to convert a floating-point value to an integer is to
use a typecast.  Typecasting is so called because it allows you
to take a value that belongs to one type and ``cast'' it into another
type (in the sense of molding or reforming, not throwing).

Unfortunately, the syntax for typecasting is ugly: you put
the name of the type in parentheses and use it as an operator.
For example:
 int x = (int) Math.PI;

The (int) operator has the effect of converting what
follows into an integer, so x gets the value 3.

Typecasting takes precedence over arithmetic operations,
so in the following example, the value of PI gets
converted to an integer first, so Java finds an error because
the casted value of PI gets converted into a double when multiplied
by 20.0, which is not of type int.
 int x = (int) Math.PI * 20.0;

Converting to an integer always rounds down, even if the fraction part
is 0.99999999.

These two properties (precedence and rounding) can make typecasting
awkward.

===Math methods===
Java provides a set of built-in functions that includes most
of the mathematical operations you can think of.  These functions
are called methods.  Most math methods operate on
doubles.

The math methods are invoked using a syntax that is similar to
the print commands we have already seen:
 double root = Math.sqrt (17.0);
 double angle = 1.5;
 double height = Math.sin (angle);

The first example sets root to the square root of 17.
The second example finds the sine of 1.5, which is the
value of the variable angle.  Java assumes that the
values you use with sin and the other trigonometric functions
(cos, tan) are in radians. If you need to convert degrees to radians:
 double degrees = 90;
 double angle = degrees * 2 * Math.PI / 360.0;

Notice that PI is in all capital letters.  Java does
not recognize Pi, pi, or pie.

Another useful method in the Math class is round,
which rounds a floating-point value off to the nearest integer
and returns an int.
 int x = (int) Math.round (Math.PI * 20.0);

In this case the multiplication happens first, before the
method is invoked.  The result is 63 (rounded up from 62.8319).

===Composition===
Just as with mathematical functions, Java methods can be 
composed, meaning that you use one expression as part of another.
For example, you can use any expression as an argument to a method:
 double x = Math.cos (angle + Math.PI/2);

This statement takes the value Math.PI, divides it by two and
adds the result to the value of the variable angle.  The sum is
then passed as an argument to the cos method.  (Notice that 
PI is the name of a variable, not a method, so there are no
arguments, not even the empty argument ()).

You can also take the result of one method and pass it as
an argument to another:
 double x = Math.exp (Math.log (10.0)):

In Java, the log function always uses base 10, so this
statement finds the log base 10 of 10.  The result gets assigned to
x; I hope you know what it is.&lt;!--someone who knows Java, review this!--&gt;

===Adding new methods===
So far we have only been using the methods that are built into Java,
but it is also possible to add new methods.  Actually, we have already
seen one method definition: main.  The method named main
is special in that it indicates where the execution of the program
begins, but the syntax for main is the same as for other
method definitions:
 public static void NAME ( LIST OF PARAMETERS ) 
   STATEMENTS

You can make up any name you want for your method, except
that you can't call it main or any other
Java keyword.  The list of
parameters specifies what information, if any, you have to
provide in order to use (or invoke) the new function.

The single parameter for main is String[] args, which
indicates that whoever invokes main has to provide an array of
Strings (we'll get to arrays in Chapter arrays).  The first
couple of methods we are going to write have no parameters, so the
syntax looks like this:
 public static void newLine () 
   System.out.println (&quot;&quot;);

This method is named newLine, and the empty parentheses
indicate that it takes no parameters.  It contains only a single
statement, which prints an empty String, indicated by &quot;&quot;.
Printing a String with no letters in it may not seem all that
useful, except remember that println skips to the next
line after it prints, so this statement has the effect of
skipping to the next line.

In main we can invoke this new method using syntax that
is similar to the way we invoke the built-in Java commands:
 public static void main (String[] args) 
   System.out.println (&quot;First line.&quot;);
   newLine ();
   System.out.println (&quot;Second line.&quot;);

The output of this program is:
 First line.
 
 Second line.

Notice the extra space between the two lines.  What if we wanted
more space between the lines?  We could invoke the same
method repeatedly:
 public static void main (String[] args) 
   System.out.println (&quot;First line.&quot;);
   newLine ();
   newLine ();
   newLine ();
   System.out.println (&quot;Second line.&quot;);

Or we could write a new method, named threeLine, that 
prints three new lines:
 public static void threeLine () 
   newLine ();  newLine ();  newLine ();
 public static void main (String[] args) 
   System.out.println (&quot;First line.&quot;);
   threeLine ();
   System.out.println (&quot;Second line.&quot;);

You should notice a few things about this program:

*You can invoke the same procedure repeatedly.  In fact, it is quite common and useful to do so.
*You can have one method invoke another method.  In this case, main invokes threeLine and threeLine invokes newLine.  Again, this is common and useful.
*In threeLine I wrote three statements all on the same line, which is syntactically legal (remember that spaces and new lines usually don't change the meaning of a program).
On the other hand, it is usually a better idea to put each
statement on a line by itself, to make your program easy to
read.  I sometimes break that rule in this book to save space.

So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to
create all these new methods.  Actually, there are a lot
of reasons, but this example only demonstrates two:

#Creating a new method gives you an opportunity to give a name to a group of statements.  Methods can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command, and by using English words in place of arcane code.  Which is clearer, newLine or System.out.println (&quot;&quot;)?
#Creating a new method can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.  For example, how would you print nine consecutive new lines?  You could just invoke threeLine three times.

===Classes===

Pulling together all the code fragments from the previous
section, the whole class definition looks like this:
 class NewLine 
   
   public static void newLine () 
     System.out.println (&quot;&quot;);
   public static void threeLine () 
     newLine ();  newLine ();  newLine ();
   public static void main (String[] args) 
     System.out.println (&quot;First line.&quot;);
     threeLine ();
     System.out.println (&quot;Second line.&quot;);

The first line indicates that this is the class definition for a new
class called NewLine.  A class is a collection of related
methods.  In this case, the class named NewLine contains three
methods, named newLine, threeLine, and main.

The other class we've seen is the Math class.  It contains
methods named sqrt, sin, and many others.  When
we invoke a mathematical function, we have to specify
the name of the class (Math) and the name of the function.
That's why the syntax is slightly different for built-in
methods and the methods that we write:
 Math.pow (2.0, 10.0);
 newLine ();

The first statement invokes the pow method in
the Math class (which raises the first argument to the
power of the second argument).  The second statement invokes
the newLine method, which Java assumes (correctly)
is in the NewLine class, which is what we are writing.

If you try to invoke a method from the wrong class, the
compiler will generate an error.  For example, if you
type:
 pow (2.0, 10.0);

The compiler will say something like, &quot;Can't find a method named pow in class NewLine.&quot;  
If you have
seen this message, you might have wondered why it was looking
for pow in your class definition.  Now you know.

===Programs with multiple methods===

When you look at a class definition that contains several methods, it
is tempting to read it from top to bottom, but that is likely to be
confusing, because that is not the order of execution of the
program.

Execution always begins at the first statement of main,
regardless of where it is in the program (in this case I deliberately
put it at the bottom).  Statements are executed one at a time, in
order, until you reach a method invocation.  Method invocations are
like a detour in the flow of execution.  Instead of going to the next
statement, you go to the first line of the invoked method, execute all
the statements there, and then come back and pick up again where you
left off.

That sounds simple enough, except that you have to remember that one
method can invoke another.  Thus, while we are in the middle of 
main, we might have to go off and execute the statements in 
threeLine.  But while we are executing threeLine, we get
interrupted three times to go off and execute newLine.

For its part, newLine invokes the built-in method
println, which causes yet another detour.  Fortunately,
Java is quite adept at keeping track of where it is, so when
println completes, it picks up where it left off in
newLine, and then gets back to threeLine, and then
finally gets back to main so the program can terminate.

Actually, technically, the program does not terminate at the
end of main.  Instead, execution picks up where it left
off in the program that invoked main, which is the
Java interpreter.  The Java interpreter takes care of things
like deleting windows and general cleanup, and then
the program terminates.

What's the moral of this sordid tale?  When you
read a program, don't read from top to bottom.  Instead,
follow the flow of execution.

===Parameters and arguments===
Some of the built-in methods we have used have parameters,
which are values that you provide to let the method do its
job.  For example, if you want to find the sine of a number,
you have to indicate what the number is.  Thus, sin
takes a double value as a parameter.  To print a string,
you have to provide the string, which is why println
takes a String as a parameter.

Some methods take more than one parameter, like pow,
which takes two doubles, the base and the exponent.

Notice that in each of these cases we have to specify not
only how many parameters there are, but also what type they
are.  So it shouldn't surprise you that when you write a
class definition, the parameter list indicates the type of
each parameter.  For example:
 public static void printTwice (String phil) 
   System.out.println (phil);
   System.out.println (phil);

This method takes a single parameter, named phil, that
has type String.  Whatever that parameter is (and at
this point we have no idea what it is), it gets printed
twice.  I chose the name phil to suggest that the name
you give a parameter is up to you, but in general you want to
choose something more illustrative than phil.

In order to invoke this method, we have to provide a String.
For example, we might have a main method like this:
 public static void main (String[] args) 
   printTwice (&quot;Don't make me say this twice!&quot;);

The string you provide is called an argument, and we
say that the argument is passed to the method.  In
this case we are creating a string value that contains the
text &quot;Don't make me say this twice!&quot; and passing that
string as an argument to printTwice where, contrary
to its wishes, it will get printed twice.

Alternatively, if we had a String variable, we could
use it as an argument instead:
 public static void main (String[] args) 
   String argument = &quot;Never say never.&quot;;
   printTwice (argument);

Notice something very important here: the name of the variable we pass
as an argument (argument) has nothing to do with the name of the
parameter (phil).  Let me say that again:

&lt;big&gt;
The name of the variable we pass as an argument has nothing to do
with the name of the parameter.
&lt;/big&gt;

They can be the same or they can be different, but it is important
to realize that they are not the same thing, except that they happen
to have the same value (in this case the string &quot;Never say never.&quot;).

The value you provide as an argument must have the same type as
the parameter of the method you invoke.  This rule is very
important, but it often gets complicated in Java for two reasons:

*There are some methods that can accept arguments with many different types.  For example, you can send any type to print and println, and it will do the right thing no matter what.  This sort of thing is an exception, though.
*If you violate this rule, the compiler often generates a confusing error message.  Instead of saying something like, &quot;You are passing the wrong kind of argument to this method,&quot; it will probably say something to the effect that it could not find a method with that name that would accept an argument with that type.  Once you have seen this error message a few times, though, you will figure out how to interpret it.

==Stack diagrams==

{{TODO|actually add diagrams}}
Parameters and other
variables only exist inside their own methods.  Within the
confines of main, there is no such thing as phil.
If you try to use it, the compiler will complain.  Similarly,
inside printTwice there is no such thing as argument.

For each method there is a gray box called a frame that contains
the methods parameters and local variables.  The name of the method
appears outside the frame.  As usual, the value of each variable
is drawn inside a box with the name of the variable beside it.

==Methods with multiple parameters==

The syntax for declaring and invoking methods with multiple
parameters is a common source of errors.  First, remember
that you have to declare the type of every parameter.  For
example
 public static void printTime (int hour, int minute) 
   System.out.print (hour);
   System.out.print (&quot;:&quot;);
   System.out.println (minute);

It might be tempting to write int hour, minute, but
that format is only legal for variable declarations, not
for parameters.

Another common source of confusion is that you do not have
to declare the types of arguments.  The following is wrong!
    int hour = 11;
    int minute = 59;
    printTime (int hour, int minute);   // WRONG!

In this case, Java can tell the type of hour
and minute by looking at their declarations.  It is
unnecessary and illegal to include the type when you pass them
as arguments.  The correct
syntax is printTime (hour, minute).

As an exercise, draw a stack frame for printTime
called with the arguments 11 and 59.

==Methods with results==
You might have noticed by now that some of the methods we are using,
like the Math methods, yield results.  Other methods,
like println and newLine, perform some action but
they don't return a value.  That raises some questions:

*What happens if you invoke a method and you don't do anything with the result (i.e. you don't assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression)?
*What happens if you use a print method as part of an expression, like System.out.println (&quot;boo!&quot;) + 7?
*Can we write methods that yield results, or are we stuck with things like newLine and printTwice?

The answer to the third question is &quot;yes, you can write methods that
return values,&quot; and we'll do it in a couple of chapters.  I will
leave it up to you to answer the other two questions by trying them
out.  In fact, any time you have a question about what is legal or
illegal in Java, a good way to find out is to ask the compiler.

==Glossary==
*'''floating-point:''' A type of variable (or value) that can contain fractions as well as integers.  In Java this type is called double.
*'''class''' A named collection of methods.  So far, we have used the Math class and the System class, and we have written classes named Hello and NewLine.
*'''method''' A named sequence of statements that performs some useful function.  Methods may or may not take parameters, and may or may not produce a result.
*'''parameter''' A piece of information you provide in order to invoke a method.  Parameters are like variables in the sense that they contain values and have types.
*'''argument''' A value that you provide when you invoke a method.  This value must have the same type as the corresponding parameter.
*'''invoke''' Cause a method to be executed.

==The modulus operator==

The modulus operator works on integers (and integer expressions)
and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided
by the second.  In Java, the modulus operator is a percent sign,
%.  The syntax is exactly the same as for other operators:

 int quotient = 7 / 3;
 int remainder = 7 % 3;

The first operator, integer division, yields 2.  The second
operator yields 1.  Thus, 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.

The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful.  For
example, you can check whether one number is divisible by
another: if x%y is zero, then x is divisible
by y.

Also, you can use the modulus operator to extract the rightmost
digit or digits from a number.  For example, x % 10 yields
the rightmost digit of x (in base 10).  Similarly
x % 100 yields the last two digits.

==Conditional execution==

In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability
to check certain conditions and change the behavior of the program
accordingly.  Conditional statements give us this ability.  The
simplest form is the if statement:


 if (x &gt; 0) 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is positive&quot;);

The expression in parentheses is called the condition.
If it is true, then the statements in brackets get executed.
If the condition is not true, nothing happens.

The condition can contain any of the comparison operators,
sometimes called relational operators:

 x == y               // x equals y
 x != y               // x is not equal to y
 x &gt; y                // x is greater than y
 x &lt; y                // x is less than y
 x &gt;= y               // x is greater than or equal to y
 x &lt;= y               // x is less than or equal to y

A common error is
to use a single = instead of a double ==.  Remember
that = is the assignment operator, and == is
a comparison operator.  Also, there is no such thing as
=&lt; or =&gt;.

The two sides of a condition operator have to be the same
type.  You can only compare ints to ints and
doubles to doubles.  Unfortunately, at this
point you can't compare Strings at all!  There is
a way to compare Strings, but we won't get to it for a couple
of chapters.

==Alternative execution==

A second form of conditional execution is alternative execution,
in which there are two possibilities, and the condition determines
which one gets executed.  The syntax looks like:

 if (x%2==0)
   System.out.println (&quot;x is even&quot;);
 else 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is odd&quot;);

If the remainder when x is divided by 2 is zero, then
we know that x is even, and this code prints a message
to that effect.  If the condition is false, the second
print statement is executed.  Since the condition must
be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be
executed.

As an aside, if you think you might want to check the parity
(evenness or oddness) of numbers often, you might want to
&quot;wrap&quot; this code up in a method, as follows:

 public static void printParity (int x) 
   if (x%2==0)
     System.out.println (&quot;x is even&quot;);
    else 
     System.out.println (&quot;x is odd&quot;);

Now you have a method named printParity that will print
an appropriate message for any integer you care to provide.
In main you would invoke this method as follows:

 printParity (17);

Always remember that when you invoke a method, you do
not have to declare the types of the arguments you provide.
Java can figure out what type they are.  You should resist the
temptation to write things like:

 int number = 17;
 printParity (int number);         // output: &quot;x is odd&quot;

==Chained conditionals==

Sometimes you want to check for a number of related conditions
and choose one of several actions.  One way to do this is by
chaining a series of ifs and elses:

 if (x &gt; 0) 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is positive&quot;);
 else if (x &lt; 0) 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is negative&quot;);
 else 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is zero&quot;);

These chains can be as long as you want, although they can
be difficult to read if they get out of hand.  One way to
make them easier to read is to use standard indentation,
as demonstrated in these examples.  If you keep all the
statements and squiggly-brackets lined up, you are less
likely to make syntax errors and you can find them more
quickly if you do.

===Nested conditionals===

In addition to chaining, you can also nest one conditional
within another.  We could have written the previous example
as:


 if (x == 0) 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is zero&quot;);
 else 
   if (x &gt; 0) 
     System.out.println (&quot;x is positive&quot;);
   else 
     System.out.println (&quot;x is negative&quot;);

There is now an outer conditional that contains two branches.  The
first branch contains a simple print statement, but the second
branch contains another conditional statement, which has two branches
of its own.  Fortunately, those two branches are both print
statements, although they could have been conditional statements as
well.

Notice again that indentation helps make the structure
apparent, but nevertheless, nested conditionals get difficult to read
very quickly.  In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you
can.

On the other hand, this kind of '''nested structure''' is common, and
we will see it again, so you better get used to it.

===The return statement===

The return statement allows you to terminate the execution
of a method before you reach the end.  One reason to use it
is if you detect an error condition:

 public static void printLogarithm (double x) 
   if (x &lt;= 0.0) 
     System.out.println (&quot;Positive numbers only, please.&quot;);
     return;
   
   double result = Math.log (x);
   System.out.println (&quot;The log of x is &quot; + result);

This defines a method named printLogarithm that takes
a double named x as a parameter.  The first thing
it does is check whether x is less than or equal to
zero, in which case it prints an error message and then uses
return to exit the method.  The flow of execution
immediately returns to the caller and the remaining lines of
the method are not executed.

I used a floating-point value on the right side of the condition
because there is a floating-point variable on the left.

===Type conversion===
You might wonder how you can get away with an expression like 
&quot;The log of x is &quot; + result, since one of the operands is a String
and the other is a double.  Well, in this case Java is being
smart on our behalf, by automatically converting the double to a
String before it does the string concatenation.

This kind of feature is an example of a common problem in designing a
programming language, which is that there is a conflict between 
formalism, which is the requirement that formal languages should have
simple rules with few exceptions, and convenience, which is the
requirement that programming languages be easy to use in practice.

More often than not, convenience wins, which is usually good for
expert programmers (who are spared from rigorous but unwieldy
formalism), but bad for beginning programmers, who are often baffled
by the complexity of the rules and the number of exceptions.  In this
book I have tried to simplify things by emphasizing the rules and
omitting many of the exceptions.

Nevertheless, it is handy to know that whenever you try to &quot;add&quot; two
expressions, if one of them is a String, then Java will convert the
other to a String and then perform string concatenation.  What do you
think happens if you perform an operation between an integer and a
floating-point value?

==Slates and Graphics objects==

In order to draw things on the screen, you need two
objects, a Slate and a Graphics object.

*'''Slate''': a Slate is a window that contains a blank rectangle you can draw on.  The Slate class is not part of the standard Java library; it is something I wrote for this course.
*'''Graphics''': the Graphics object is the object we will use to draw lines, circles, etc.  It is part of the Java library, so the documentation for it is on the Sun web site.

The methods that pertain to Graphics objects are defined
in the built-in Graphics class.  The methods that pertain
to Slates are defined in the Slate class, which is
shown in Appendix slate.

The primary method in the Slate class is makeSlate,
which does pretty much what you would expect.  It creates
a new window and returns a Slate object you can use
to refer to the window later in the program.  You can create
more than one Slate in a single program.

 Slate slate = Slate.makeSlate (500, 500);

makeSlate takes two arguments, the width and height of the
window.  Because it belongs to a different class, we have
to specify the name of the class using ``dot notation.''

The return value gets assigned to a variable named slate.  There
is no conflict between the name of the class (with an upper-case
''S'') and the name of the variable (with a lower-case ''s'').

The next method we need is getGraphics, which takes a 
Slate object and creates a Graphics object that can draw on it.
You can think of a Graphics object as a piece of chalk.

 Graphics g = Slate.getGraphics (slate);

Using the name g is conventional, but we could have called it
anything.

===Invoking methods on a Graphics object===
====setColor====

In order to draw things on the screen, you invoke methods on the
graphics object.  We have invoked lots of methods already,
but this is the first time we have ''invoked a method on an
object.''  The syntax is similar to invoking a method from another
class:

 g.setColor (Color.black);
 g.drawOval (x, y, width, height);

The name of the object comes before the dot; the name of the method
comes after, followed by the arguments for that method.  In this case,
the method takes a single argument, which is a color.

setColor changes the current color, in this case to
black.  Everything that gets drawn will be black, until we
use setColor again.

Color.black is a special value provided by the Color
class, just as Math.PI is a special value provided by the
Math class.  Color, you will be happy to hear, provides a
palette of other colors, including:

 black     blue    cyan   darkGray   gray   lightGray
 magenta	  orange  pink   red        white  yellow

====drawOval====
To draw on the Slate, we can invoke draw methods
on the Graphics object.  For example:

 g.drawOval (x, y, width, height);

drawOval takes four integers as arguments.
These arguments specify a bounding box, which is the rectangle
in which the oval will be drawn (as shown in the figure).  The
bounding box itself is not drawn; only the oval is.  The bounding box
is like a guideline.  Bounding boxes are always oriented horizontally
or vertically; they are never at a funny angle.

===bounding box===
If you think about it, there are lots of ways to specify the location
and size of a rectangle.  You could give the location of the center or
any of the corners, along with the height and width.  Or, you could
give the location of opposing corners.  The choice is arbitrary, but
in any case it will require the same number of parameters: four.

By convention, the usual way to specify a bounding box is to
give the location of the upper-left corner and the width
and height.  The usual way to specify a location is to use a
coordinate system.

====Coordinates====

You are probably familiar with Cartesian coordinates in two
dimensions, in which each location is identified by an x-coordinate
(distance along the x-axis) and a y-coordinate.  By convention,
Cartesian coordinates increase to the right and up, as shown in the
figure.

Annoyingly, it is conventional for computer graphics systems to use a
variation on Cartesian coordinates in which the origin is in the
upper-left corner of the screen or window, and the direction of the
positive y-axis is down.  Java follows this convention.

====pixel====

The unit of measure is called a pixel; a typical screen is about
1000 pixels wide.  Coordinates are always integers.  If you want to
use a floating-point value as a coordinate, you have to round it off
to an integer (See Section rounding).


===A lame Mickey Mouse===

Let's say we want to draw a picture of Mickey Mouse.  We can use the
oval we just drew as the face, and then add ears.  Before we do that
it is a good idea to break the program up into two methods.
main will create the Slate and Graphics objects and
then invoke draw, which does the actual drawing.

 public static void main (String[] args) 
   int width = 500;
   int height = 500;
   
   Slate slate = Slate.makeSlate (width, height);
   Graphics g = Slate.getGraphics (slate);
   
   g.setColor (Color.black);
   draw (g, 0, 0, width, height);
   
 public static void draw (Graphics g, int x, int y, int width, int height) 
   g.drawOval (x, y, width, height);
   g.drawOval (x, y, width/2, height/2);
   g.drawOval (x+width/2, y, width/2, height/2);

The parameters for draw are the Graphics object and a
bounding box.  draw invokes drawOval three times, to draw
Mickey's face and two ears.  The following figure shows the bounding
boxes for the ears.

  /-\ /-\
 |  | |  |
  \ / \ /
   /---\
  |     |
   \___/
   
As shown in the figure, the coordinates of the upper-left
corner of the bounding box for the left ear are (x, y).
The coordinates for the right ear are (x+width/2, y).
In both cases, the width and height of the ears are half
the width and height of the original bounding box.

Notice that the coordinates of the ear boxes are all relative
to the location (x and y) and size (width and 
height) of the original bounding box.  As a result, we can
use draw to draw a Mickey Mouse (albeit a lame
one) anywhere on the screen in any size.  As an exercise, modify
the arguments passed to draw so that Mickey is one half
the height and width of the screen, and centered.

===Other drawing commands===
prototype
 drawLine
 drawRect
 fillOval
 fillRect
 prototype
 interface

===drawRect, drawLine===
Another drawing command with the same parameters as
drawOval is

 drawRect (int x, int y, int width, int height)

Here I am using a standard format for documenting the name
and parameters of methods.  This information is sometimes
called the method's interface or prototype.
Looking at this prototype, you can tell what types the
parameters are and (based on their names) infer what they
do.  Here's another example:

 drawLine (int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

The use of parameter names x1, x2, y1 and 
y2 suggests that drawLine draws a line from the
point (x1, y1) to the point (x2, y2).

One other command you might want to try is

 drawRoundRect (int x, int y, int width, int height,
	        int arcWidth, int arcHeight)

The first four parameters specify the bounding box of
the rectangle; the remaining two parameters indicate
how rounded the corners should be, specifying the
horizontal and vertical diameter of the arcs at the
corners.

===fillRect, fillOval===
There are also ``fill'' versions of these commands, that not
only draw the outline of a shape, but also fill it in.
The interfaces are identical; only the names have been
changed:

 fillOval (int x, int y, int width, int height)
 fillRect (int x, int y, int width, int height)
 fillRoundRect (int x, int y, int width, int height,
	        int arcWidth, int arcHeight)

There is no such thing as fillLine---it just doesn't
make sense.  Lines are one-dimensional

==Recursion==

I mentioned in the last chapter that it is legal for one
method to call another, and we have seen several examples of
that.  I neglected to mention that it is also legal for
a method to invoke itself.  It may not be obvious why that
is a good thing, but it turns out
to be one of the most magical and interesting things
a program can do.

For example, look at the following method:
 public static void countdown (int n) 
   if (n == 0) 
     System.out.println (&quot;Blastoff!&quot;);
   else 
     System.out.println (n);
     countdown (n-1);

The name of the method is countdown and it takes a single
integer as a parameter.  If the parameter is zero, it prints
the word ''Blastoff.''  Otherwise, it prints the number and
then invokes a method named countdown---itself---passing
n-1 as an argument.

*What happens if we invoke this method, in main, like
this:
 countdown (3);

#The execution of countdown begins with n=3, and
since n is not zero, it prints the value 3, and then
invokes itself, passing 3-1...
#The execution of countdown begins with n=2, and
since n is not zero, it prints the value 2, and then
invokes itself, passing 2-1...
#The execution of countdown begins with n=1, and
since n is not zero, it prints the value 1, and then
invokes itself, passing 1-1...
#The execution of countdown begins with n=0, and
since n is zero, it prints the word ''Blastoff!''
and then returns.
#The countdown that got n=1 returns.
#The countdown that got n=2 returns.
#The countdown that got n=3 returns.

And then you're back in main (what a trip).  So the
total output looks like:

 3
 2
 1
 Blastoff!

As a second example, let's look again at the methods
newLine and threeLine.
 
 public static void newLine () 
   System.out.println (&quot;&quot;);
 
 public static void threeLine () 
   newLine ();  newLine ();  newLine ();
  
verbatim

Although these work, they would not be much help if I wanted
to print 2 newlines, or 106.  A better alternative would be

 public static void nLines (int n) 
   if (n &gt; 0) 
     System.out.println (&quot;&quot;);
     nLines (n-1);

This program is very similar; as long as n is greater
than zero, it prints one newline, and then invokes itself to
print n-1 additional newlines.  Thus, the total number
of newlines that get printed is 1 + (n-1), which usually
comes out to roughly n.

'''The process of a method invoking itself is called recursion, and
such methods are said to be recursive.'''

===Stack diagrams for recursive methods===

In the previous chapter we used a stack diagram to represent the
state of a program during a method call.  The same kind
of diagram can make it easier to interpret a recursive method.

Remember that every time a method gets called it creates
a new instance of the method that contains a new version of
the method's local variables and parameters.

There is one instance of main and four instances of
countdown, each with a different value for the parameter
n.  The bottom of the stack, countdown with n=0
is the base case.  It does not make a recursive call, so there
are no more instances of countdown.

The instance of main is empty because main does not
have any parameters or local variables.  As an exercise, draw a
stack diagram for nLines, invoked with the parameter n=4.


===Convention and divine law===
In the last few sections, I used the phrase ``by convention''
several times to indicate design decisions that are arbitrary
in the sense that there are no significant reasons to do things
one way or another, but dictated by convention.

In these cases, it is to your advantage to be familiar with
convention and use it, since it will make your programs easier
for others to understand.  At the same time, it is important to
distinguish between (at least) three kinds of rules:

*'''Divine law''' This is my phrase to indicate a rule that
is true because of some underlying principle of logic or
mathematics, and that is true in any programming language
(or other formal system).  For example, there is no way to
specify the location and size of a bounding box using fewer
than four pieces of information.  Another example is that adding
integers is commutative.  That's part of the definition of
addition and has nothing to do with Java.
*'''Rules of Java''' These are the syntactic and semantic
rules of Java that you cannot violate, because the
resulting program will not compile or run.  Some are arbitrary;
for example, the fact that the + symbol represents
addition and string concatenation.  Others reflect
underlying limitations of the compilation or execution process.
For example, you have to specify the types of parameters, but
not arguments.
*'''Style and convention''' There are a lot of rules that
are not enforced by the compiler, but that are essential for
writing programs that are correct, that you can debug and
modify, and that others can read.  Examples include indentation
and the placement of squiggly braces, as well as conventions
for naming variables, methods and classes.

As we go along, I will try to indicate which category various things
fall into, but you might want to give it some thought from time to
time.

While I am on the topic, you have probably figured out by now that the
names of classes always begin with a capital letter, but variables and
methods begin with lower case.  If a name includes more than one word,
you usually capitalize the first letter of each word, as in 
newLine and printParity.  Which category are these rules in?

===Glossary===
*'''modulus''' An operator that works on integers and yields
the remainder when one number is divided by another.  In Java
it is denoted with a percent sign ().
*'''conditional''' A block of statements that may or may not
be executed depending on some condition.
*'''chaining''' A way of joining several conditional statements
in sequence.
*'''nesting''' Putting a conditional statement inside one or both
branches of another conditional statement.
*'''coordinate''' A variable or value that specifies a location
in a two-dimensional graphical window.
*'''pixel''' The unit in which coordinates are measured.
*'''bounding box''' A common way to specify the coordinates of
a rectangular area.
*'''typecast''' An operator that converts from one type to another.
In Java it appears as a type name in parentheses, like (int).
*'''interface''' A description of the parameters required by
a method and their types.
*'''prototype''' A way of describing the interface to a method
using Java-like syntax.
*'''recursion''' The process of invoking the same method you
are currently executing.
*'''infinite recursion''' A method that invokes itself
recursively without ever reaching the base case.  The usual
result is a StackOverflowException.
*'''fractal''' A kind of image that is defined recursively, so
that each part of the image is a smaller version of the whole.

===Return values===

Some of the built-in methods we have used, like the Math
functions, have produced results.  That is, the effect of
invoking the method is to generate a new value, which we
usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.
For example:
 double e = Math.exp (1.0);
 double height = radius * Math.sin (angle);

But so far all the methods we have written have been void
methods; that is, methods that return no value.  When you invoke
a void method, it is typically on a line by itself, with
no assignment:
    nLines (3);
    g.drawOval (0, 0, width, height);

In this chapter, we are going to write methods that return things,
which I will refer to as fruitful methods, for want of a better
name.  The first example is area, which takes a 
double as a parameter, and returns the area of a circle with the
given radius:
 public static double area (double radius) 
   double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
   return area;

The first thing you should notice is that the beginning of the
method definition is different.  Instead of public static
void, which indicates a void method, we see public static
double, which indicates that the return value from this method
will have type double.  I still haven't explained what
public static means, but be patient.

===static===

Also, notice that the last line is an alternate form of the
return statement that includes a return value.  This
statement means, ''return immediately from this method and
use the following expression as a return value.''  The
expression you provide can be arbitrarily complicated,
so we could have written this method more concisely:
 public static double area (double radius) 
   return Math.PI * radius * radius;

On the other hand, temporary variables like area often
make debugging easier.  In either case, the type of the expression in
the return statement must match the return type of the method.
In other words, when you declare that the return type is double,
you are making a promise that this method will eventually
produce a double.  If you try to return with no
expression, or an expression with the wrong type, the compiler will
take you to task.

===temporary variable===

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return
statements, one in each branch of a conditional:
 public static double absoluteValue (double x) 
   if (x &lt; 0) 
     return -x;
   else 
     return x;

Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional,
only one will be executed.  Although it is legal to have more than one
return statement in a method, you should keep in mind
that as soon as one is executed, the method
terminates without executing any subsequent statements.

Code that appears after a return statement, or any place else
where it can never be executed, is called dead code.  Some
compilers warn you if part of your code is dead.

===Dead code===
If you put return statements inside a conditional, then
you have to guarantee that every possible path through
the program hits a return statement.  For example:
 public static double absoluteValue (double x) 
   if (x &lt; 0) 
     return -x;
   else if (x &gt; 0) 
     return x;      // WRONG!!

This program is not legal because if x happens to be 0, then
neither condition will be true and the method will end without hitting
a return statement.  A typical compiler message would be ''return
statement required in absoluteValue,'' which is a confusing message
considering that there are already two of them.

===Program development===
At this point you should be able to look at complete Java methods
and tell what they do.  But it may not be clear yet how to go
about writing them.  I am going to suggest one technique that
I call incremental development.

====incremental development====

As an example, imagine you want to find the distance between
two points, given by the coordinates.  By the usual definition:
 distance = sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)

The first step is to consider what a distance method
should look like in Java.  In other words, what are the inputs
(parameters) and what is the output (return value).

In this case, the two points are the parameters, and it is
natural to represent them using four doubles, although
we will see later that there is a Point object in Java
that we could use.  The return value is the distance, which
will have type double.

Already we can write an outline of the method:
 public static double distance
              (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
   return 0.0;

The statement return 0.0; is a place-keeper that is necessary
in order to compile the program.  Obviously, at this stage the
program doesn't do anything useful, but it is worthwhile to
try compiling it so we can identify any syntax errors before
we make it more complicated.

In order to test the new method, we have to invoke it with
sample values.  Somewhere in main I would add:
 double dist = distance (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0);

I chose these values so that the horizontal
distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way,
the result will be 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle).
When you are testing a method, it is useful to know the right
answer.

Once we have checked the syntax of the method definition, we
can start adding lines of code one at a time.  After each
incremental change, we recompile and run the program.  That
way, at any point we know exactly where the error must be---in
the last line we added.

The next step in the computation is to find the differences
between x_1 and x_2, and between y_1 and y_2.  I will store those values in
temporary variables named dx and dy.
 public static double distance
              (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
   double dx = x2 - x1;
   double dy = y2 - y1;
   System.out.println (&quot;dx is &quot; + dx);
   System.out.println (&quot;dy is &quot; + dy);
   return 0.0;

I added print statements that will let me check the intermediate
values before proceeding.  As I mentioned, I already know that they
should be 3.0 and 4.0.

====scaffolding====

When the method is finished I will remove the print statements.  Code
like that is called scaffolding, because it is helpful for
building the program, but it is not part of the final product.
Sometimes it is a good idea to keep the scaffolding around, but
comment it out, just in case you need it later.

The next step in the development is to square dx and dy.
We could use the Math.pow method, but it is simpler and
faster to just multiply each term by itself.
 public static double distance
              (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
   double dx = x2 - x1;
   double dy = y2 - y1;
   double dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy;
   System.out.println (&quot;dsquared is &quot; + dsquared);
   return 0.0;

Again, I would compile and run the program at this stage
and check the intermediate value (which should be 25.0).

Finally, we can use the Math.sqrt method to compute and
return the result.
 public static double distance
              (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
   double dx = x2 - x1;
   double dy = y2 - y1;
   double dsquared = dx*dx + dy*dy;
   double result = Math.sqrt (dsquared);
   return result;
  
Then in main, we should print and check the value of the result.

As you gain more experience programming, you might find yourself
writing and debugging more than one line at a time.  Nevertheless,
this incremental development process can save you a lot of
debugging time.

The key aspects of the process are:
*Start with a working program and make small, incremental
changes.  At any point, if there is an error, you will know
exactly where it is.
*Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so
you can print and check them.
*Once the program is working, you might want to remove
some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into
compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program
difficult to read.

===Composition===

As you should expect by now, once you define a new method,
you can use it as part of an expression, and you can build
new methods using existing methods.  For example, what if someone
gave you two points, the center of the circle and a point on
the perimeter, and asked for the area of the circle?

Let's say the center point is stored in the variables xc
and yc, and the perimeter point is in xp and
yp.  The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which
is the distance between the two points.  Fortunately, we have
a method, distance that does that.
 double radius = distance (xc, yc, xp, yp);

The second step is to find the area of a circle with that
radius, and return it.
 double area = area (radius);
 return area;

Wrapping that all up in a method, we get:
 public static double fred
              (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) 
   double radius = distance (xc, yc, xp, yp);
   double area = area (radius);
   return area;

The name of this method is fred, which may seem odd.  I will
explain why in the next section.

The temporary variables radius and area are
useful for development and debugging, but once the program is
working we can make it more concise by composing
the method invocations:
 public static double fred (double xc, double yc, double xp, double yp) 
   return area (distance (xc, yc, xp, yp));


===Overloading===
In the previous section you might have noticed that fred
and area perform similar functions---finding
the area of a circle---but take different parameters.  For
area, we have to provide the radius; for fred
we provide two points.

If two methods do the same thing, it is natural to give them
the same name.  In other words, it would make more sense if
fred were called area.

Having more than one method with the same name, which is called 
overloading, is legal in Java as long as each version takes
different parameters.  So we can go ahead and rename fred:
 public static double area (double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) 
   return area (distance (xc, yc, xp, yp));

When you invoke an overloaded method, Java knows which version you
want by looking at the arguments that you provide.  If you write:
 double x = area (3.0);

Java goes looking for a method named area that
takes a single double as an argument, and so it uses the
first version, which interprets the argument as a radius.
If you write:
 double x = area (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0);

Java uses the second version of area.  More amazing
still, the second version of area actually invokes the
first.

Many of the built-in Java commands are overloaded, meaning that there
are different versions that accept different numbers or types of
parameters.  For example, there are versions of print and 
println that accept a single parameter of any type.  In the Math
class, there is a version of abs that works on doubles,
and there is also a version for ints.

Although overloading is a useful feature, it should be used
with caution.  You might get yourself nicely confused if you
are trying to debug one version of a method while accidently
invoking a different one.

Actually, that reminds me of one of the cardinal rules of
debugging: make sure that the version of the program
you are looking at is the version of the program that is running!
Some time you may find yourself making one change after another
in your program, and seeing the same thing every time you run it.
This is a warning sign that for one reason or another you are
not running the version of the program you think you are.  To
check, stick in a print statement (it doesn't matter what
you print) and make sure the behavior of the program changes
accordingly.

===Boolean expressions===
Most of the operations we have seen produce results that are
the same type as their operands.  For example, the + operator
takes two ints and produces an int, or two doubles
and produces a double, etc.

====relational operator====
The exceptions we have seen are the relational operators, which
compare ints and floats and return either true or
false.  true and false are special values in Java,
and together they make up a type called boolean.  You might
recall that when I defined a type, I said it was a set of values.  In
the case of ints, doubles and Strings, those sets
are pretty big.  For booleans, not so big.

Boolean expressions and variables work just like other types of
expressions and variables:
 boolean fred;
 fred = true;
 boolean testResult = false;

The first example is a simple variable declaration;
the second example is an assignment, and the third example is a
combination of a declaration and an assignment, sometimes
called an initialization.  The values true and false
are keywords in Java, so they may appear in a different color,
depending on your development environment.

====initialization====
As I mentioned, the result of a conditional operator is a boolean,
so you can store the result of a comparison in a variable:
 boolean evenFlag = (n
 boolean positiveFlag = (x &gt; 0);    // true if x is positive

and then use it as part of a conditional statement later:
 if (evenFlag) 
   System.out.println (&quot;n was even when I checked it&quot;);

A variable used in this way is frequently called a flag,
since it flags the presence or absence of some condition.



===Logical operators===
There are three logical operators in Java: AND, OR and NOT,
which are denoted by the symbols &amp;&amp;, || and !. The
semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar
to their meaning in English.  For example (x &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (x &lt; 10)
is true only if x is greater than zero AND less than 10.

====semantics====
evenFlag  n3 == 0 is true if either of
the conditions is true, that is, if evenFlag is true OR the
number is divisible by 3.

Finally, the NOT operator has the effect of negating or
inverting a boolean expression, so !evenFlag is true
if evenFlag is false---if the number is odd.

====nested structure====

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested
conditional statements.  For example, how would you write
the following code using a single conditional?
 if (x &gt; 0) 
   if (x &lt; 10) 
     System.out.println (&quot;x is a positive single digit.&quot;);

===Boolean methods===
Methods can return boolean values just like any other type,
which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests inside
methods.  For example:
 public static boolean isSingleDigit (int x) 
   if (x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10) 
     return true;
   else 
     return false;

The name of this method is isSingleDigit.  It is common
to give boolean methods names that sound like yes/no questions.
The return type is boolean, which means that every return
statement has to provide a boolean expression.

The code itself is straightforward, although it is a bit longer than
it needs to be.  Remember that the expression x &gt;= 0  x &lt; 10
has type boolean, so there is nothing wrong with returning it
directly, and avoiding the if statement altogether:
 public static boolean isSingleDigit (int x) 
   return (x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10);

In main you can invoke this method in the usual ways:
 boolean bigFlag = !isSingleDigit (17);
 System.out.println (isSingleDigit (2));

The first line assigns the value true to bigFlag
only if 17 is not a single-digit number.  The second
line prints true because 2 is a single-digit number.
Yes, println is overloaded to handle booleans, too.

The most common use of boolean methods is inside conditional
statements:
 if (isSingleDigit (x)) 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is little&quot;);
 else 
   System.out.println (&quot;x is big&quot;);

===More recursion===
Now that we have methods that return values, you might be interested
to know that we have a complete programming language, by which I
mean that anything that can be computed can be expressed in this
language.  Any program ever written could be rewritten
using only the language features we have used so far (actually, we
would need a few commands to control devices like the keyboard, mouse,
disks, evil robots, etc., but that's all).

====Turing, Alan====

Proving this claim is a non-trivial exercise first
accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the first computer scientists
(well, some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of the
early computer scientists started as mathematicians).  Accordingly, it
is known as the Turing thesis.  If you take a course on the Theory of
Computation, you will have a chance to see the proof.

To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools we have learned
so far, let's look at some methods for evaluating
recursively-defined mathematical functions.  A recursive definition is
similar to a circular definition, in the sense that the definition
contains a reference to the thing being defined.  A truly circular
definition is typically not very useful:

====description====

[[Wiktionary:frabjuous|frabjuous]]: an adjective used to describe
something that is frabjuous.

If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be
annoyed.  On the other hand, if you looked up the definition
of the mathematical function factorial, you might
get something like:

 eqnarray*
 &amp;&amp;  0! = 1 
 &amp;&amp;  n! = n (n-1)!
 eqnarray*

(Factorial is usually denoted with the symbol , which is
not to be confused with the Java logical operator ! which
means NOT.)  This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1,
and the factorial of any other value, , is  multiplied
by the factorial of .  So  is 3 times , which is 2 times
, which is 1 times .  Putting it all together, we get
 equal to 3 times 2 times 1 times 1, which is 6.

If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can usually
write a Java program to evaluate it.  The first step is to decide what
the parameters are for this function, and what the return type is.
With a little thought, you should conclude that factorial takes an
integer as a parameter and returns an integer:
  public static int factorial (int n) 

If the argument happens to be zero, all we have to do is
return 1:
 public static int factorial (int n) 
   if (n == 0) 
     return 1;

Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make
a recursive call to find the factorial of , and then
multiply it by .
 public static int factorial (int n) 
   if (n == 0) 
     return 1;
   else 
     int recurse = factorial (n-1);
     int result = n * recurse;
     return result;

If we look at the flow of execution for this program,
it is similar to nLines from the previous chapter.
If we invoke factorial with the value 3:

Process:
*Since 3 is not zero, we take the second branch and calculate
the factorial of ...
*Since 2 is not zero, we take the second branch and calculate
the factorial of ...*
Since 1 is not zero, we take the second branch and calculate
the factorial of ...
*Since 0 is zero, we take the first branch and return
the value 1 immediately without making any more recursive
calls.
*The return value (1) gets multiplied by n, which is 1,
and the result is returned.
*The return value (1) gets multiplied by n, which is 2,
and the result is returned.
*The return value (2) gets multiplied by n, which is 3,
and the result, 6, is returned to main, or whoever
invoked factorial (3).

Notice that in the last instance of factorial, the local
variables recurse and result do not exist because
when n=0 the branch that creates them does not execute.

===Leap of faith===

Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but as
you saw in the previous section, it can quickly become labarynthine.
An alternative is what I call the ``leap of faith.''  When you come to
a method invocation, instead of following the flow of execution, you
assume that the method works correctly and returns the
appropriate value.

In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith
when you use built-in methods.  When you invoke Math.cos
or drawOval, you don't examine the implementations of 
those methods.  You just assume that they work, because the people
who wrote the built-in classes were good programmers.

Well, the same is true when you invoke one of your own methods.
For example, in Section boolean we wrote a method called
isSingleDigit that determines whether a number is between
0 and 9.  Once we have convinced ourselves that this method
is correct---by testing and examination of the code---we can
use the method without ever looking at the code again.

The same is true of recursive programs.  When you get to
the recursive invocation, instead of following the flow of
execution, you should assume that the recursive invocation
works (yields the correct result), and then ask yourself,
''Assuming that I can find the factorial of , can I
compute the factorial of ?''  In this case, it is clear
that you can, by multiplying by .

Of course, it is a bit strange to assume that the method
works correctly when you have not even finished writing it,
but that's why it's called a leap of faith!

===One more example===
In the previous example I used temporary variables to spell out the
steps, and to make the code easier to debug, but I could have saved a
few lines:
 public static int factorial (int n) 
   if (n == 0) 
     return 1;
   else 
     return n * factorial (n-1);

From now on I will tend to use the more concise version, but
I recommend that you use the more explicit version while you
are developing code.   When you have it working, you can
tighten it up, if you are feeling inspired.

After factorial, the classic example of a recursively-defined
mathematical function is fibonacci, which has the
following definition:

eqnarray*
&amp;&amp; fibonacci(0) = 1 
&amp;&amp; fibonacci(1) = 1 
&amp;&amp; fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
eqnarray*

Translated into Java, this is:
 public static int fibonacci (int n) 
   if (n == 0  n == 1) 
     return 1;
   else 
     return fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2);

If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly small
values of n, your head explodes.  But according to the leap of
faith, if we assume that the two recursive calls (yes, you can make
two recursive calls) work correctly, then it is clear that we get the
right result by adding them together.

===Multiple assignment===
I haven't said much about it, but it is legal in Java to
make more than one assignment to the same variable.  The
effect of the second assignment is to replace the old value
of the variable with a new value.
 int fred = 5;
 System.out.print (fred);
 fred = 7;
 System.out.println (fred);

The output of this program is 57, because the first
time we print fred his value is 5, and the second time
his value is 7.

This kind of multiple assignment is the reason I
described variables as a container for values.  When
you assign a value to a variable, you change the contents of
the container.

When there are multiple assignments to a variable, it is especially
important to distinguish between an assignment statement and a
statement of equality.  Because Java uses the = symbol for
assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b
as a statement of equality.  (a==b) is a statement of equality!

First of all, equality is commutative, and assignment is not.
For example, in mathematics if '''a = b''' then '''b = a'''.  But in
Java, '''a = 7''' is a legal assignment statement, and '''7 = a''';
is not.

Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is true
for all time. If a==b now, then a will always equal b. In a 
computer program, however, variables are intrinsically inconsistent.
In Java, an assignment statement can make two variables equal,
but they don't have to stay that way!
 int a = 5;
 int b = a;     // a and b are now equal
 a = 3;         // a and b are no longer equal

The third line changes the value of a but it does not
change the value of b, and so they are no longer equal.
In many programming languages an alternate symbol is used
for assignment, such as &lt;- or :=, in order to
avoid this confusion.

Although multiple assignment is frequently useful, you should
use it with caution.  If the values of variables are changing
constantly in different parts of the program, it can make
the code difficult to read and debug.

===Loops===
One of the things computers are often used for is the automation
of repetitive tasks.  Repeating identical or similar tasks without
making errors is something that computers do well and people do
poorly.

We have already seen programs that use recursion to perform
repetition, such as nLines and countdown.  This
type of repetition is called iteration, and Java provides
several language features that make it easier to write iterative
programs.

The two features we are going to look at are the while
statement and the for statement.

===The while statement===

Using a while statement, we can rewrite countdown:
 public static void countdown (int n) 
 {
   while (n &gt; 0) 
   {
     System.out.println (n);
     n = n - 1;
   }
   System.out.println (&quot;Blastoff!&quot;);
 }

You can almost read a while statement as if it were
English.  What this means is, ``While n is greater than
zero, continue printing the value of n and then reducing
the value of n by 1.  When you get to zero, print the
word `Blastoff!'''

More formally, the flow of execution for a while statement
is as follows:

#Evaluate the condition in parentheses, yielding true or false.
#If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.
#If the condition is true, execute each of the statements between the squiggly-brackets, and then go back to step 1.

This type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops
back around to the top.  Notice that if the condition is false the
first time through the loop, the statements inside the loop are
never executed.  The statements inside the loop are sometimes called
the body of the loop.

The body of the loop should change the value of
one or more variables so that, eventually, the condition becomes
false and the loop terminates.  Otherwise the loop will repeat
forever, which is called an infinite loop.  An endless
source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation
that the directions on shampoo, ``Lather, rinse, repeat,'' are
an infinite loop.

In the case of countdown, we can prove that the loop
will terminate because we know that the value of n is
finite, and we can see that the value of n gets smaller
each time through the loop (each iteration), so
eventually we have to get to zero.  In other cases it is not
so easy to tell:
 public static void sequence (int n) 
 {
   while (n != 1) 
   {
     System.out.println (n);
     if (n % 2 == 0)
     {
       n = n / 2;
     }
     else                   // n is odd
     {
       n = n * 3 + 1;
     }
   }
 }

The condition for this loop is n != 1, so the loop
will continue until n is 1, which will make the condition
false.

At each iteration, the program prints the value of n and then
checks whether it is even or odd.  If it is even, the value of
n is divided by two.  If it is odd, the value is replaced
by n * 3 + 1.  For example, if the starting value (the argument passed
to sequence) is 3, the resulting sequence is
3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Since n sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no
obvious proof that n will ever reach 1, or that the program will
terminate.  For some particular values of n, we can prove
termination.  For example, if the starting value is a power of two, then
the value of n will be even every time through the loop, until
we get to 1.  The previous example ends with such a sequence,
starting with 16.

Particular values aside, the interesting question is whether
we can prove that this program terminates for all values of n.
So far, no one has been able to prove it or disprove it!

===Tables===

One of the things loops are good for is generating and printing
tabular data.  For example, before computers were readily
available, people had to calculate logarithms,
sines and cosines, and other common mathematical functions
by hand.

To make that easier, there were books containing long tables
where you could find the values of various functions.
Creating these tables was slow and boring, and the result
tended to be full of errors.

When computers appeared on the scene, one of the initial reactions
was, ''This is great!  We can use the computers to generate the
tables, so there will be no errors.''  That turned out to be true
(mostly), but shortsighted.  Soon thereafter computers (and
calculators) were so pervasive that the tables became obsolete.

Well, almost.  It turns out that for some operations, computers
use tables of values to get an approximate answer, and then
perform computations to improve the approximation.  In some
cases, there have been errors in the underlying tables, most
famously in the table the original Intel Pentium used to perform
floating-point division.

Although a ''log table'' is not as useful as it once was, it still
makes a good example of iteration.  The following program prints a
sequence of values in the left column and their logarithms in the
right column:
 double x = 1.0;
 while (x &lt; 10.0) 
 {
   System.out.println (x + &quot;   &quot; + Math.log(x));
   x = x + 1.0;
 }

The output of this program is:
 1.0   0.0
 2.0   0.6931471805599453
 3.0   1.0986122886681098
 4.0   1.3862943611198906
 5.0   1.6094379124341003
 6.0   1.791759469228055
 7.0   1.9459101490553132
 8.0   2.0794415416798357
 9.0   2.1972245773362196

Looking at these values, can you tell what base the log
function uses by default?

Since powers of two are so important
in computer science, we often want to find logarithms with
respect to base 2.  To find that, we have to use the following
formula:

 _2 x = log_e x / log_e 2

Changing the print statement to
 System.out.println (x + &quot;   &quot; + Math.log(x) / Math.log(2.0));

yields:
 1.0   0.0
 2.0   1.0
 3.0   1.5849625007211563
 4.0   2.0
 5.0   2.321928094887362
 6.0   2.584962500721156
 7.0   2.807354922057604
 8.0   3.0
 9.0   3.1699250014423126

We can see that 1, 2, 4 and 8 are powers of two, because
their logarithms base 2 are round numbers.  If we wanted to find
the logarithms of other powers of two, we could modify the
program like this:
 double x = 1.0;
 while (x &lt; 100.0) 
 {
   System.out.println (x + &quot;   &quot; + Math.log(x) / Math.log(2.0));
   x = x * 2.0;
 }

Now instead of adding something to x each time through
the loop, which yields an arithmetic sequence, we multiply
x by something, yielding a geometric sequence.
The result is:
 1.0   0.0
 2.0   1.0
 4.0   2.0
 8.0   3.0
 16.0   4.0
 32.0   5.0
 64.0   6.0

Log tables may not be useful any more, but for computer scientists,
knowing the powers of two is!  Some time when you have an idle
moment, you should memorize the powers of two up to 65536
(that's 2^16).

===Two-dimensional tables===

A two-dimensional table is a table where you choose a row and
a column and read the value at the intersection.  A multiplication
table is a good example.  Let's say you wanted to print a
multiplication table for the values from 1 to 6.

A good way to start is to write a simple loop that prints
the multiples of 2, all on one line.
 int i = 1;
 while (i &lt;= 6) 
 {
   System.out.print (2 * i + &quot;   &quot;);
   i = i + 1;
 }
 System.out.println (&quot;&quot;);

The first line initializes a variable named i, which is
going to act as a loop counter.  As the
loop executes, the value of i increases from 1 to 6,
and then when i is 7, the loop terminates.  Each
time through the loop, we print the value 2*i followed
by three spaces.  Since we are using the print command
rather than println, all the output appears on a single
line.

As I mentioned in Section printing, in some environments the
output from print gets stored without being displayed until 
println is invoked.  If the program terminates, and you forget to
invoke println, you may never see the stored output.

The output of this program is:
 2   4   6   8   10   12

So far, so good.  The next step is to encapsulate and 
generalize.

===Encapsulation and generalization===

Encapsulation usually means taking a piece of code and wrapping it up
in a method, allowing you to take advantage of all the things methods
are good for.  We have seen two examples of encapsulation, when we
wrote printParity in Section alternative and 
isSingleDigit in Section boolean.

Generalization means taking something specific, like printing
multiples of 2, and making it more general, like printing the
multiples of any integer.

Here's a method that encapsulates the loop from the previous
section and generalizes it to print multiples of n.
 public static void printMultiples (int n) 
 {
   int i = 1;
   while (i &lt;= 6) 
   {
     System.out.print (n * i + &quot;   &quot;);
     i = i + 1;
   }
   System.out.println ();
 }
   

To encapsulate, all I had to do was add the first line,
which declares the name, parameter,
and return type.  To generalize, all I had to do was replace
the value 2 with the parameter n.

If I invoke this method with the argument 2, I get the same
output as before.  With argument 3, the output is:
 3   6   9   12   15   18

and with argument 4, the output is:
 4   8   12   16   20   24 

By now you can probably guess how we are going to print a
multiplication table: we'll invoke printMultiples repeatedly with
different arguments.  In fact, we are going to use another loop to
iterate through the rows.
 int i = 1;
 while (i &lt;= 6) 
 {
   printMultiples (i);
   i = i + 1;
 }

First of all, notice how similar this loop is to the one inside 
printMultiples.  All I did was replace the print statement with a
method invocation.

The output of this program is:
 1   2   3   4   5   6   
 2   4   6   8   10   12   
 3   6   9   12   15   18   
 4   8   12   16   20   24   
 5   10   15   20   25   30   
 6   12   18   24   30   36   

which is a (slightly sloppy) multiplication table.  If the
sloppiness bothers you, Java provides methods that give you
more control over the format of the output, but I'm not
going to get into that here.

====Methods====

In the last section I mentioned ''all the things methods
are good for.''  About this time, you might be wondering
what exactly those things are.  Here are some of the reasons
methods are useful:

*By giving a name to a sequence of statements, you make your program easier to read and debug.
*Dividing a long program into methods allows you to separate parts of the program, debug them in isolation, and then compose them into a whole.
*Methods facilitate both recursion and iteration.
*Well-designed methods are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.

===More encapsulation===

To demonstrate encapsulation again, I'll take the code
from the previous section and wrap it up in a method:
 public static void printMultTable () 
 {
   int i = 1;
   while (i &lt;= 6) 
   {
     printMultiples (i);
     i = i + 1;
   }
 }

The process I am demonstrating is a common 
development plan.  You develop code gradually by adding
lines to main or someplace else, and then when you get
it working, you extract it and wrap it up in a method.

The reason this is useful is that you sometimes don't know
when you start writing exactly how to divide the program into
methods.  This approach lets you design as you go along.

===Local variables===

About this time, you might be wondering how we can use the same
variable i in both printMultiples and 
printMultTable.  Didn't I say that you can only declare a variable
once?  And doesn't it cause problems when one of the methods changes
the value of the variable?

The answer to both questions is ''no,'' because the i in 
printMultiples and the i in printMultTable are
not the same variable.  They have the same name, but
they do not refer to the same storage location, and changing
the value of one of them has no effect on the other.

Variables that are declared inside a method definition are
called local variables because they are local to their
own methods.  You cannot access a local variable from outside
its ''home'' method, and you are free to have multiple
variables with the same name, as long as they are not in
the same method.

It is often a good idea to use different variable names in
different methods, to avoid confusion, but there are good
reasons to reuse names.  For example, it is common to
use the names i, j and k as loop variables.
If you avoid using them in one method just because you
used them somewhere else, you will probably make the program
harder to read.

===More generalization===

As another example of generalization, imagine you wanted
a program that would print a multiplication table of any
size, not just the 6x6 table.  You could add a parameter to
printMultTable:
 public static void printMultTable (int high) 
 {
   int i = 1;
   while (i &lt;= high) 
   {
     printMultiples (i);
     i = i + 1;
   }
 }

I replaced the value 6 with the parameter high.  If I
invoke printMultTable with the argument 7, I get:
 1   2   3   4   5   6   
 2   4   6   8   10   12   
 3   6   9   12   15   18   
 4   8   12   16   20   24   
 5   10   15   20   25   30   
 6   12   18   24   30   36   
 7   14   21   28   35   42   

which is fine, except that I probably want the table to
be square (same number of rows and columns), which means
I have to add another parameter to printMultiples,
to specify how many columns the table should have.

Just to be annoying, I will also call this parameter high,
demonstrating that different methods can have parameters
with the same name (just like local variables):
 public static void printMultiples (int n, int high) 
 {
   int i = 1;
   while (i &lt;= high) 
   {
     System.out.print (n*i + &quot;   &quot;);
     i = i + 1;
   }
   newLine ();
 }

 public static void printMultTable (int high) 
 {
   int i = 1;
   while (i &lt;= high) 
   {
     printMultiples (i, high);
     i = i + 1;
   }
 }

Notice that when I added a new parameter, I had to change the first
line of the method (the interface or prototype), and I also had to
change the place where the method is invoked in printMultTable.
As expected, this program generates a square 7x7 table:
 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   
 2   4   6   8   10   12   14   
 3   6   9   12   15   18   21   
 4   8   12   16   20   24   28   
 5   10   15   20   25   30   35   
 6   12   18   24   30   36   42   
 7   14   21   28   35   42   49

When you generalize a method appropriately, you often find
that the resulting program has capabilities you did not intend.
For example, you might notice that the multiplication table
is symmetric, because n*i==i*n, so all the entries in the
table appear twice.  You could save ink by printing only
half the table.  To do that, you only have to change one
line of printMultTable.  Change
 printMultiples (i, high);

to
 printMultiples (i, i);

and you get:
 1   
 2   4   
 3   6   9   
 4   8   12   16   
 5   10   15   20   25   
 6   12   18   24   30   36   
 7   14   21   28   35   42   49  

I'll leave it up to you to figure out how it works.

===Invoking methods on objects===

In Section graphics we used a Graphics object to draw circles in
a window, and I used the phrase ``invoke a method on an object,''
to refer to the statements like
 g.drawOval (0, 0, width, height);

In this case drawOval is the method being invoked on the
object named g.  At the time I didn't provide a definition
of object, and I still can't provide a complete definition,
but it is time to try.

====object====

In Java and other object-oriented languages, objects are collections
of related data that come with a set of methods.  These methods
operate on the objects, performing computations and sometimes
modifying the object's data.

So far we have only seen one object, g, so this definition might
not mean much yet.  Another example is Strings.
Strings are objects (and ints and doubles are
not).  Based on the definition of object, you might ask
''What is the data contained in a String object?'' and ''What
are the methods we can invoke on String objects?''

The data contained in a String object are the letters of the string.
There are quite a few methods that operate on Strings, but
I will only use a few in this book.  The rest are documented at
[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html the java site]

The first method we will look at is charAt, which allows you
to extract letters from a String.  In order to store the result, we
need a variable type that can store individual letters (as opposed
to strings).  Individual letters are called characters, and the
variable type that stores them is called char.

====char====

chars work just like the other types we have seen:
    char fred = 'c';
    if (fred == 'c') 
      System.out.println (fred);

Character values appear in single quotes ('c').  Unlike
string values (which appear in double quotes), character values
can contain only a single letter or symbol.

Here's how the charAt method is used:
    String fruit = &quot;banana&quot;;
    char letter = fruit.charAt(1);
    System.out.println (letter);

The syntax fruit.charAt indicates that I am 
invoking the charAt method on the object named
fruit.
I am passing the argument 1 to this method,
which indicates that I would like to know the first letter of
the string.  The result is a character, which is stored in a
char named letter.  When I print the value of
letter, I get a surprise:
 a

a is not the first letter of &quot;banana&quot;.  Unless you are a
computer scientist.  For perverse reasons, computer scientists always
start counting from zero.  The 0th letter (``zeroeth'') of 
&quot;banana&quot; is b.  The 1th letter (``oneth'') is a and the
2th (``twoeth'') letter is n.

If you want the zereoth letter of a string, you have to pass
zero as an argument:
    char letter = fruit.charAt(0);

===Length===

The second String method we'll look at is length, which
returns the number of characters in the string.  For example:
    int length = fruit.length();

length takes no arguments, as indicated by (),
and returns an integer, in this case 6.  Notice that it is
legal to have a variable with the same name as a method (although
it can be confusing for human readers).

To find the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to
try something like:
    int length = fruit.length();
    char last = fruit.charAt (length);       // WRONG!!

That won't work.  The reason is that there is no 6th letter
in &quot;banana&quot;.  Since we started counting at 0, the 6
letters are numbered from 0 to 5.  To get the last character,
you have to subtract 1 from length.

===Traversal===

A common thing to do with a string is
start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do
something to it, and continue until the end.  This pattern
of processing is called a traversal.  A natural
way to encode a traversal is with a while statement:
    int index = 0;
    while (index &lt; fruit.length()) 
      char letter = fruit.charAt (index);
      System.out.println (letter);
      index = index + 1;

This loop traverses the string and prints each letter on
a line by itself.  Notice that the condition is
index &lt; fruit.length(), which means that when
index is equal to the length of the string, the
condition is false and the body of the loop is not executed.
The last character we access is the one with the
index fruit.length()-1.

The name of the loop variable is index.  An 
index is a variable or value used to specify one member of an ordered
set (in this case the set of characters in the string).  The index
indicates (hence the name) which one you want.  The set has to be
ordered so that each letter has an index and each index
refers to a single character.

As an exercise, write a method that takes a String
as an argument and that prints the letters backwards, all on
one line.

===Run-time errors===

Way back in Section run-time I talked about run-time errors,
which are errors that don't appear until a program has started
running.  In Java run-time errors are called exceptions.

So far, you probably haven't seen many run-time errors, because we
haven't been doing many things that can cause one.  Well, now we are.
If you use the charAt command and you provide an index that is
negative or greater than length-1, you will get an exception:
specifically, a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.  Try it
and see how it looks.

If your program causes an exception, it prints an error message
indicating the type of exception and where in the program it
occurred.  Then the program terminates.

===Reading documentation===

If you go to
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
and click on charAt, you get the following documentation
(or something like it):
 public char charAt(int index)
 
 Returns the character at the specified index.
 An index ranges from 0 to length() - 1. 
 
 Parameters: index - the index of the character. 
 
 Returns: the character at the specified index of this string.
         The first character is at index 0. 
 
 Throws: StringIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range.
 verbatim

The first line is the method's prototype (see
Section prototype), which indicates the name of the method, the
type of the parameters, and the return type.

The next line describes what the method does.  The next two
lines explain the parameters and return values.  In this case
the explanations are a bit redundant, but the documentation is
supposed to fit a standard format.  The last line explains what
exceptions, if any, can be caused by this method.

===The indexOf method===

In some ways, indexOf is the opposite of charAt.
charAt takes an index and returns the character at that
index.  indexOf takes a character and finds the index
where that character appears.

charAt fails if the index is out of range, and causes an
exception.  indexOf fails if the character does not appear in
the string, and returns the value -1.
    String fruit = &quot;banana&quot;;
    int index = fruit.indexOf('a');

This finds the index of the letter 'a' in the string.
In this case, the letter appears three times, so it is not
obvious what indexOf should do.  According to the
documentation, it returns the index of the first appearance.

In order to find subsequent appearances, there is an alternate
version of indexOf (for an explanation of this kind
of overloading, see Section overloading).  It takes a
second argument that indicates where in the string to start
looking.  If we invoke
    int index = fruit.indexOf('a', 2);

it will start at the twoeth letter (the first n) and find
the second a, which is at index 3.  If the letter happens
to appear at the starting index, the starting index is the
answer.  Thus,
    int index = fruit.indexOf('a', 5);
returns 5.  Based on the documentation, it is a little tricky
to figure out what happens if the starting index is out
of range:

''indexOf returns the index of the first occurrence of the
character in the character sequence represented by this object that is
greater than or equal to fromIndex, or -1 if the character does not
occur.''

One way to figure out what this means is to try out a couple
of cases.  Here are the results of my experiments:

*If the starting index is greater than or equal to length(), the result is -1, indicating that the letter does not appear at any index greater than the starting index.

*If the starting index is negative, the result is 1, indicating the first appearance of the letter at an index greater than the starting index.

If you go back and look at the documentation, you'll see that
this behavior is consistent with the definition, even if it
was not immediately obvious.  Now that we have a better idea
how indexOf works, we can use it as part of a program.

===Looping and counting===

The following program counts the
number of times the letter 'a' appears in a string:
    String fruit = &quot;banana&quot;;
    int length = fruit.length();
    int count = 0;
    
    int index = 0;
    while (index &lt; length) 
      if (fruit.charAt(index) == 'a') 
        count = count + 1;
      
      index = index + 1;
    
    System.out.println (count);

This program demonstrates a common idiom, called a counter.  The
variable count is initialized to zero and then incremented each
time we find an 'a' (to increment is to increase by one;
it is the opposite of decrement, and unrelated to 
excrement, which is a noun).  When we exit the loop, count
contains the result: the total number of a's.

As an exercise, encapsulate this code in a method named
countLetters, and generalize it so that it accepts the
string and the letter as arguments.

As a second exercise, rewrite the method so that it uses
indexOf to locate the a's, rather than checking
the characters one by one.

===Increment and decrement operators===

Incrementing and decrementing are such common operations that
Java provides special operators for them.  The ++
operator adds one to the current value of an int or
char.  -- subtracts one.  Neither operator works
on doubles, booleans or Strings.

Technically, it is legal to increment a variable and use it
in an expression at the same time.  For example, you might see
something like:
    System.out.println (i++);

Looking at this, it is not clear whether the increment will
take effect before or after the value is printed.  Because
expressions like this tend to be confusing, I would discourage
you from using them.  In fact, to discourage you even more,
I'm not going to tell you what the result is.  If you really
want to know, you can try it.

Using the increment operators, we can rewrite the letter-counter:
    int index = 0;
    while (index &lt; length) 
      if (fruit.charAt(index) == 'a') 
        count++;
      
      index++;

It is a common error to write something like
    index = index++;             // WRONG!!

Unfortunately, this is syntactically legal, so the compiler
will not warn you.  The effect of this statement is to leave
the value of index unchanged.  This is often a difficult
bug to track down.

Remember, you can write index = index +1;, or you
can write index++;, but you shouldn't mix them.

===Character arithmetic===

It may seem odd, but you can do arithmetic with characters!  The
expression 'a' + 1 yields the value 'b'.  Similarly, if
you have a variable named letter that contains a character, then
letter - 'a' will tell you where in the alphabet it appears
(keeping in mind that 'a' is the zeroeth letter of the alphabet and
'z' is the 25th).

This sort of thing is useful for converting between the characters
that contain numbers, like '0', '1' and '2', and the corresponding
integers.  They are not the same thing.  For example, if you try this
    char letter = '3';
    int x = (int) letter;
    System.out.println (x);

you might expect the value 3, but depending on your environment,
you might get 51, which is the ASCII code that is used to
represent the character '3', or you might get something else
altogether.  To convert '3' to the corresponding integer value
you can subtract '0':
    int x = (int)(letter - '0');

Technically, in both of these examples the typecast ((int)) is
unnecessary, since Java will convert type char to type int
automatically.  I included the typecasts to emphasize the difference
between the types, and because I'm a stickler about that sort of
thing.

Since this conversion can be a little ugly, it is preferable to use
the digit method in the Character class.  For example:
    int x = Character.digit (letter, 10);

converts letter to the corresponding digit, interpreting
it as a base 10 number.

Another use for character arithmetic is to loop through the letters of
the alphabet in order.  For example, in Robert McCloskey's book 
Make Way for Ducklings, the names of the ducklings form an
abecedarian series, something like Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Oack, Pack and
Qack.  Here is a loop that prints these names in order:
    char letter = 'J';
    while (letter &lt;= 'Q') 
      System.out.println (letter + &quot;ack&quot;);
      letter++;

Notice that in addition to the arithmetic operators, we can also
use the conditional operators on characters.  The output of this
program is:
 Jack
 Kack
 Lack
 Mack
 Nack
 Oack
 Pack
 Qack

Of course, that's not quite right because I've misspelled ''Ouack''
and ''Quack.''  As an exercise, modify the program to correct
this error.

===Typecasting for experts===
Here's a puzzler: normally, the statement x++ is exactly
equivalent to x = x + 1.  Unless x is a char!  In
that case, x++ is legal, but x = x + 1 causes an error.

Try it out and see what the error message is, then see if you
can figure out what is going on.

===Strings are immutable===
As you look over the documentation of the String methods, you
might notice toUpperCase and toLowerCase.  These
methods are often a source of confusion, because it sounds
like they have the effect of changing (or mutating) an
existing string.  Actually, neither these methods nor any
others can change a string, because strings are immutable.

When you invoke toUpperCase on a String, you get a
new String as a return value.  For example:
    String name = &quot;Alan Turing&quot;;
    String upperName = name.toUpperCase ();

After the second line is executed, upperName contains
the value &quot;ALAN TURING&quot;, but name still contains
&quot;Alan Turing&quot;.

===Strings are incomparable===

It is often necessary to compare strings to see if they are the same,
or to see which comes first in alphabetical order.  It would be
nice if we could use the comparison operators, like == and &gt;,
but we can't.

In order to compare Strings, we have to use the equals
and compareTo methods.  For example:
    String name1 = &quot;Alan Turing&quot;;
    String name2 = &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;;
 
    if (name1.equals (name2)) 
      System.out.println (&quot;The names are the same.&quot;);
    
 
    int flag = name1.compareTo (name2);
    if (flag == 0) 
      System.out.println (&quot;The names are the same.&quot;);
     else if (flag &lt; 0) 
      System.out.println (&quot;name1 comes before name2.&quot;);
     else if (flag &gt; 0) 
      System.out.println (&quot;name2 comes before name1.&quot;);

The syntax here is a little weird.  To compare two things, you
have to invoke a method on one of them and pass the other
as an argument.

The return value from equals is straightforward enough;
true if the strings contain the same characters, and
false otherwise.

The return value from compareTo is a little odd.  It is
the difference between the first characters in the strings
that differ.  If the strings are equal, it is 0.  If the
first string (the one on which the method is invoked) comes
first in the alphabet, the difference is negative.  Otherwise,
the difference is positive.  In this case the return value
is positive 8, because the second letter of ''Ada'' comes
before the second letter of ''Alan'' by 8 letters.

Using compareTo is often tricky, and I never remember
which way is which without looking it up, but the good news
is that the interface is pretty standard for comparing many
types of objects, so once you get it you are all set.

Just for completeness, I should admit that it is
legal, but very seldom correct, to use the ==
operator with Strings.  But what that means will not make
sense until later, so for now, don't do it.

===What's interesting?===
Although Strings are objects, they are not very interesting ones, because

*They are immutable.
*They have no instance variables.
*You don't have to use the ''new'' construct to create one.

In this chapter, we are going to use two new object types that are
part of the Java language: Point and Rectangle.
Please note that these are not graphical objects that appear on the
screen, but variables that contain data, just like ints
and doubles.  Like other variables, they can be used internally
to perform computations.

The definitions of the Point and Rectangle classes are
in the java.awt package, so we have to import them.

===Packages===
The built-in Java classes are divided into a number of 
packages, including java.lang, which contains almost all of the
classes we have seen so far, and java.awt, which contains
classes that pertain to the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT),
which contains classes for windows, buttons, graphics, etc.

In order to use a package, you have to import it, which is
why the program in Section graphics starts with import
java.awt.*.  The * indicates that we want to import all
the classes in the AWT package.  If you want, you can name the classes
you want to import explicitly, but there is no great advantage.  The
classes in java.lang are imported automatically, which is why
most of our programs haven't required an import statement.

All import statements appear at the beginning of the program,
outside the class definition.

===Point objects===
At the most basic level, a point is two numbers (coordinates)
that we treat collectively as a single object.  In mathematical
notation, points are often written in parentheses, with a comma
separating the coordinates.  For example,  indicates
the origin, and  indicates the point  units to the
right and  units up from the origin.

In Java, a point is represented by a Point object.  To
create a new point, you have to use the '''new''' command:
    Point blank;
    blank = new Point (3, 4);

The first line is a conventional variable declaration: blank has
type Point.  The second line is kind of funny-looking; it
invokes the new command, specifies the type of the new object,
and provides arguments.  It will probably not surprise you that the
arguments are the coordinates of the new point.

The result of the new command is a reference to the new
point.  I'll explain references more later; for now the important
thing is that the variable blank contains a the address of the
newly-created object.

Taken together, all the variables, values, and objects in a
program are called the '''state'''.  Diagrams like this that
show the state of the program are called state diagrams.
As the program runs, the state changes, so you should think
of a state diagram as a snapshot of a particular point in the
execution.

===Instance variables===
The pieces of data that make up an object are sometimes called
components, records, or fields.  In Java they are called instance
variables because each object, which is an instance of its
type, has its own copy of the instance variables.

It's like the glove compartment of a car.  Each car is an instance
of the type ''car,'' and each car has its own glove compartment.  If
you asked me to get something from the glove compartment of your car,
you would have to tell me which car is yours.

Similarly, if you want to read a value from an instance variable, you
have to specify the object you want to get it from.  In Java this is
done using '''dot notation.'''
    int x = blank.x;

The expression blank.x means ''go to the object blank
refers to, and get the value of x.''  In this case we assign
that value to a local variable named x.  Notice that there is no
conflict between the local variable named x and the instance
variable named x.  The purpose of dot notation is to identify
which variable you are referring to unambiguously.

You can use dot notation as part of any Java expression, so the
following are legal.
    System.out.println (blank.x + &quot;, &quot; + blank.y);
    int distance = blank.x * blank.x + blank.y * blank.y;

The first line prints 3, 4; the second line calculates
the value 25.

===Objects as parameters===
You can pass objects as parameters in the usual way.  For
example:
  public static void printPoint (Point p){
    System.out.println (&quot;(&quot; + p.x + &quot;, &quot; + p.y + &quot;)&quot;);
  }

is a method that takes a point as an argument and prints it in
the standard format.  If you invoke printPoint (blank),
it will print (3, 4).  Actually, Java has a built-in
method for printing Points.  If you invoke
System.out.println (blank), you get:
java.awt.Point[x=3,y=4]

This is a standard format Java uses for printing objects.  It prints
the name of the type, followed by the contents of the object,
including the names and values of the instance variables.

As a second example, we can rewrite the distance method from
Section distance so that it takes two Points as parameters
instead of four doubles.
  public static double distance (Point p1, Point p2) {
    double dx = (double)(p2.x - p1.x);
    double dy = (double)(p2.y - p1.y);
    return Math.sqrt (dx*dx + dy*dy);
  }

The typecasts are not really necessary; I just added them as a
reminder that the instance variables in a Point are integers.

===Rectangles===

Rectangles are similar to points, except that they have four
instance variables, named x, y, width and 
height.  Other than that, everything is pretty much the same.

    Rectangle box = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 200);

creates a new Rectangle object and makes box refer to it.

If you print box, you get:

    java.awt.Rectangle[x=0,y=0,width=100,height=200]

Again, this is the result of a built-in Java method that knows how
to print Rectangle objects.


===Objects as return types===

You can write methods that return objects.  For example,
findCenter takes a Rectangle as an argument and
returns a Point that contains the coordinates of the
center of the Rectangle:

  public static Point findCenter (Rectangle box) 
    int x = box.x + box.width/2;
    int y = box.y + box.height/2;
    return new Point (x, y);
  

Notice that you can use new to create a new object,
and then immediately use the result as a return value.

===Objects are mutable===

You can change the contents of an object by making an assignment
to one of its instance variables.  For example, to ``move''
a rectangle without changing its size, you could modify the
x and y values:

    box.x = box.x + 50;
    box.y = box.y + 100;

We could take this code and encapsulate it in a method, and
generalize it to move the rectangle by any amount:

  public static void moveRect (Rectangle box, int dx, int dy) 
    box.x = box.x + dx;
    box.y = box.y + dy;


The variables dx and dy indicate how far to move the
rectangle in each direction.  Invoking this method has the effect of
modifying the Rectangle that is passed as an argument.

    Rectangle box = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 200);
    moveRect (box, 50, 100);
    System.out.println (box);

    prints java.awt.Rectangle[x=50,y=100,width=100,height=200].

Modifying objects by passing them as arguments to methods can be
useful, but it can also make debugging more difficult because it is
not always clear which method invocations do or do not modify their
arguments.  Later, I will discuss some pros and cons of this
programming style.

In the meantime, we can enjoy the luxury of Java's built-in
methods, which include translate, which does exactly
the same thing as moveRect, although the syntax for
invoking it is a little different.  Instead of passing the
Rectangle as an argument, we invoke translate 
on the Rectangle and pass only dx and dy
as arguments.

    box.translate (50, 100);

The effect is exactly the same.

===Aliasing===
aliasing
 aliasing
 reference

Remember that when you make an assignment to an object variable, you
are assigning a reference to an object.  It is possible to have
multiple variables that refer to the same object.  For example,
this code:

    Rectangle box1 = new Rectangle (0, 0, 100, 200);
    Rectangle box2 = box1;

Both box1 and box2 refer or ``point'' to the same object.
In other words, this object has two names, box1 and box2.
When a person uses two names, it's called aliasing.  Same thing
with objects.

When two variables are aliased, any changes that affect one
variable also affect the other.  For example:

    System.out.println (box2.width);
    box1.grow (50, 50);
    System.out.println (box2.width);

The first line prints 100, which is the width of the
Rectangle referred to by box2.  The second
line invokes the grow method on box1, which
expands the Rectangle by 50 pixels in every direction
(see the documentation for more details).&lt;!==  The effect
is shown in the figure:


figure=figs/aliasing2.eps--&gt;

As should be clear from this figure, whatever changes are
made to box1 also apply to box2.  Thus, the
value printed by the third line is 200, the width of
the expanded rectangle.  (As an aside, it is perfectly legal
for the coordinates of a Rectangle to be negative.)

As you can tell even from this simple example, code that
involves aliasing can get confusing fast, and it can be very
difficult to debug.  In general, aliasing should be avoided
or used with care.

===null===

When you create an object variable, remember that you are
creating a reference to an object.  Until you make
the variable point to an object, the value of the variable
is null.  null is a special value in Java (and
a Java keyword) that is used to mean ``no object.''

The declaration Point blank; is equivalent to this
initialization:

    Point blank = null;


If you try to use a null object, either by accessing an instance
variable or invoking a method, you will get a 
NullPointerException.  The system will print an error message
and terminate the program.

    Point blank = null;
    int x = blank.x;              // NullPointerException
    blank.translate (50, 50);     // NullPointerException

On the other hand, it is legal to pass a null object as an argument or
receive one as a return value.  In fact, it is common to do so, for
example to represent an empty set or indicate an error condition.

===Garbage collection===

In Section aliasing we talked about what happens when
more than one variable refers to the same object.  What happens
when no variable refers to an object?  For example:

    Point blank = new Point (3, 4);
    blank = null;

The first line creates a new Point object and makes
blank refer to it.  The second line changes blank
so that instead of referring to the object, it refers to
nothing (the null object).

If no one refers to an object, then no one can read or write any of
its values, or invoke a method on it.  In effect, it ceases to exist.
We could keep the object in memory, but it would only waste space, so
periodically as your program runs, the Java system looks for stranded
objects and reclaims them, in a process called garbage
collection.  Later, the memory space occupied by the object will
be available to be used as part of a new object.

You don't have to do anything to make garbage collection work,
and in general you will not be aware of it.

===Objects and primitives===

There are two kinds of types in Java, primitive types and
object types.  Primitives, like int and boolean
begin with lower-case letters; object types begin with
upper-case letters.  This distinction is useful because it
reminds us of some of the differences between them:

When you declare a primitive variable, you get storage
space for a primitive value.  When you declare an object variable, you
get a space for a reference to an object.  In order to get space for
the object itself, you have to use the new command.

If you don't initialize a primitive type, it is given
a default value that depends on the type.  For example,
0 for ints and true for booleans.
The default value for object types is null, which indicates
no object.

Primitive variables are well isolated in the sense that there is
nothing you can do in one method that will affect a variable in
another method.  Object variables can be tricky to work with because
they are not as well isolated.  If you pass a reference to an object
as an argument, the method you invoke might modify the object, in which
case you will see the effect.  The same is true when you invoke a
method on an object.  Of course, that can be a good thing, but you
have to be aware of it.

There is one other difference between primitives and object
types.  You cannot add new primitives to the Java language
(unless you get yourself on the standards committee), but
you can create new object types!  We'll see how in the next
chapter.

===Class definitions and object types===

Every time you write a class definition, you create a new
Object type, with the same name as the class.  Way back in
Section hello, when we defined the class named Hello,
we also created an object type named Hello.  We
didn't create any variables with type Hello, and we
didn't use the new command to create any Hello
objects, but we could have!

That example may not make any sense, since there is no
reason to create a Hello object, and it is not clear
what it would be good for if we did.  In this chapter, we
will look at some examples of class definitions that create
useful new Object types.

Here are the most important ideas in this chapter:

*Defining a new class also creates a new object type
with the same name.

*A class definition is like a template for objects:
it determines what instance variables the objects have and
what methods can operate on them.

*Every object belongs to some object type; hence, it
is an instance of some class.

*When you invoke the new command to create an object, Java
invokes a special method called a constructor to initialize the
instance variables.  You provide one or more constructors as part of
the class definition.

*Typically all the methods that operate on a type go in the
class definition for that type.

Here are some syntax issues about class definitions:

*Class names (and hence object types) always begin with a capital
letter, which helps distinguish them from primitive types and variable
names.

*You usually put one class definition in each file, and the name
of the file must be the same as the name of the class, with the suffix
.java.  For example, the Time class is defined in the file
named Time.java.

*In any program, one class is designated as the startup
class.  The startup class must contain a method named main, which
is where the execution of the program begins.  Other classes may
have a method named main, but they will not be executed.


With those issues out of the way, let's look at an example of
a user-defined type, Time.

===Time===

A common motivation for creating a new Object type is to take several
related pieces of data and encapsulate them into an object that can be
manipulated (passed as an argument, operated on) as a single unit.  We
have already seen two built-in types like this, Point and 
Rectangle.

Another example, which we will implement ourselves, is Time,
which is used to record the time of day.  The various pieces of
information that form a time are the hour, minute and second.  Because
every Time object will contain these data, we need to create
instance variables to hold them.

The first step is to decide what type each variable should be.  It
seems clear that hour and minute should be integers.  Just
to keep things interesting, let's make second a double, so
we can record fractions of a second.

Instance variables are declared at the beginning of the class
definition, outside of any method definition, like this:

 class Time 
   int hour, minute;
   double second;

All by itself, this code fragment is a legal class definition. &lt;!-- The
state diagram for a Time object would look like this:


figure=figs/time.eps

--&gt;

After declaring the instance variables, the next step is usually
to define a constructor for the new class.

===Constructors===

The usual role of a constructor is to initialize the instance
variables.  The syntax for constructors is similar to that
of other methods, with three exceptions:

*The name of the constructor is the same as the name of
the class.

*Constructors have no return type and no return value.

*The keyword static is omitted.


Here is an example for the Time class:

  public Time () 
    this.hour = 0;
    this.minute = 0;
    this.second = 0.0;


Notice that where you would expect to see a return type,
between public and Time, there is nothing.  That's
how we (and the compiler) can tell that this is a constructor.

This constructor does not take any arguments, as indicated by the
empty parentheses ().  Each line of the constructor initializes
an instance variable to an arbitrary default value (in this case,
midnight).  The name this is a special
keyword that is the name of the object we are creating.  You can use
this the same way you use the name of any other object.  For
example, you can read and write the instance variables of this,
and you can pass this as an argument to other methods.

But you do not declare this and you do not use new
to create it.  In fact, you are not even allowed to make an
assignment to it!  this is created by the system; all you
have to do is store values in its instance variables.

A common error when writing constructors is to put a return
statement at the end.  Resist the temptation.

===More constructors===

Constructors can be overloaded, just like other methods,
which means that you can provide multiple constructors
with different parameters.  Java knows which constructor
to invoke by matching the arguments of the new
command with the parameters of the constructors.

It is very common to have one constructor that takes no
arguments (shown above), and one constructor that takes
a parameter list that is identical to the list of instance
variables.  For example:

  public Time (int hour, int minute, double second) 
    this.hour = hour;
    this.minute = minute;
    this.second = second;


The names and types of the parameters are exactly the same as
the names and types of the instance variables.  All the
constructor does is copy the information from the parameters
to the instance variables.

If you go back and look at the documentation for Points
and Rectangles, you will see that both classes provide
constructors like this.  Overloading constructors provides the
flexibility to create an object first and then fill in the
blanks, or to collect all the information before creating
the object.

So far this might not seem very interesting, and in fact it
is not.  Writing constructors is a boring, mechanical process.
Once you have written two, you will find that you can churn them
out in your sleep, just by looking at the list of instance
variables.

===Creating a new object===

Although constructors look like methods, you never invoke them
directly.  Instead, when you use the new command, the system
allocates space for the new object and then 
invokes your constructor to initialize the instance variables.

The following program demonstrates two ways to create and
initialize Time objects:

  class Time 
    int hour, minute;
    double second;
  
    public Time () 
      this.hour = 0;
      this.minute = 0;
      this.second = 0.0;
  

    public Time (int hour, int minute, double second) 
      this.hour = hour;
      this.minute = minute;
      this.second = second;
    
  
    public static void main (String[] args) 
  
      // one way to create and initialize a Time object
      Time t1 = new Time ();
      t1.hour = 11;
      t1.minute = 8;
      t1.second = 3.14159;
      System.out.println (t1);
  
      // another way to do the same thing
      Time t2 = new Time (11, 8, 3.14159);
      System.out.println (t2);
    

As an exercise, figure out the flow of execution through this
program.

In main, the first time we invoke the new command,
we provide no arguments, so Java invokes the first constructor.
The next few lines assign values to each of the instance
variables.

The second time we invoke the new command, we provide
arguments that match the parameters of the second constructor.
This way of initializing the instance variables is more concise
(and slightly more efficient), but it can be harder to read, since
it is not as clear which values are assigned to which instance
variables.

===Printing an object===

The output of this program is:

  Time@80cc7c0
  Time@80cc807

When Java prints the value of a user-defined object type, it prints
the name of the type and a special hexadecimal (base 16) code that is
unique for each object.  This code is not meaningful in itself; in
fact, it can vary from machine to machine and even from run to run.
But it can be useful for debugging, in case you want to keep track of
individual objects.

In order to print objects in a way that is more meaningful to users
(as opposed to programmers), you usually want to write a method
called something like printTime:

  public static void printTime (Time t) 
    System.out.println (t.hour + &quot;:&quot; + t.minute + &quot;:&quot; + t.second);


Compare this method to the version of printTime in
Section time.

The output of this method, if we pass either t1 or t2 as
an argument, is 11:8:3.14159.  Although this is recognizable
as a time, it is not quite in the standard format.  For example, if
the number of minutes or seconds is less than 10, we expect a leading
0 as a place-keeper.  Also, we might want to drop the decimal
part of the seconds.  In other words, we want something like
11:08:03.

In most languages, there are simple ways to control the output format
for numbers.  In Java there are no simple ways.

Java provides very powerful tools for printing formatted things
like times and dates, and also for interpreting formatted input.
Unfortunately, these tools are not very easy to use, so I am going to
leave them out of this book.  If you want, though, you can take a look
at the documentation for the Date class in the 
java.util package.



===Operations on objects===

Even though we can't print times in an optimal format, we can still
write methods that manipulate Time objects.  In the next few
sections, I will demonstrate several of the possible interfaces for
methods that operate on objects.  For some operations, you will have a
choice of several possible interfaces, so you should consider the pros
and cons of each of these:

'''pure function:'''  Takes objects and/or primitives as
arguments but does not modify the objects.  The return value is
either a primitive or a new object created inside the method.

'''modifier:'''  Takes objects as arguments and modifies some
or all of them.  Often returns void.  void

'''fill-in method:'''  One of the arguments is an ''empty''
object that gets filled in by the method.  Technically, this is
a type of modifier.


===Pure functions===

A method is considered a pure function if the result depends only on
the arguments, and it has no side effects like modifying an argument
or printing something.  The only result of invoking a pure function is
the return value.

One example is after, which compares two Times and
returns a boolean that indicates whether the first operand
comes after the second:

  public static boolean after (Time time1, Time time2) 
    if (time1.hour &gt; time2.hour) return true;
    if (time1.hour &lt; time2.hour) return false;

    if (time1.minute &gt; time2.minute) return true;
    if (time1.minute &lt; time2.minute) return false;

    if (time1.second &gt; time2.second) return true;
    return false;


What is the result of this method if the two times are equal?  Does
that seem like the appropriate result for this method?  If you were
writing the documentation for this method, would you mention that case
specifically?

A second example is addTime, which calculates the sum of two
times.  For example, if it is 9:14:30, and your breadmaker takes
3 hours and 35 minutes, you could use addTime to figure out when
the bread will be done.

Here is a rough draft of this method that is not quite right:

  public static Time addTime (Time t1, Time t2) 
    Time sum = new Time ();
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour;
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute;
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second;
    return sum;
 

Although this method returns a Time object, it is not
a constructor.  You should go back and compare the syntax of
a method like this with the syntax of a constructor, because
it is easy to get confused.

Here is an example of how to use this method.  If currentTime
contains the current time and breadTime contains the amount
of time it takes for your breadmaker to make bread, then you
could use addTime to figure out when the bread will be
done.

    Time currentTime = new Time (9, 14, 30.0);
    Time breadTime = new Time (3, 35, 0.0);
    Time doneTime = addTime (currentTime, breadTime);
    printTime (doneTime);

The output of this program is 12:49:30.0, which is
correct.  On the other hand, there are cases where the result
is not correct.  Can you think of one?

The problem is that this method does not deal with cases
where the number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than
60.  In that case, we have to ``carry'' the extra seconds
into the minutes column, or extra minutes into the hours
column.

Here's a second, corrected version of this method.

  public static Time addTime (Time t1, Time t2) 
    Time sum = new Time ();
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour;
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute;
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second;

    if (sum.second &gt;= 60.0) 
      sum.second -= 60.0;
      sum.minute += 1;
    
    if (sum.minute &gt;= 60) 
      sum.minute -= 60;
      sum.hour += 1;
    
    return sum;


Although it's correct, it's starting to get big.  Later,
I will suggest an alternate approach to this problem that
will be much shorter.

This code demonstrates two operators we have not seen before,
+= and -=.  These operators provide a concise
way to increment and decrement variables.  They are similar
to ++ and --, except (1) they work on doubles
as well as ints, and (2) the amount of the increment
does not have to be 1.  The statement sum.second -= 60.0;
is equivalent to sum.second = sum.second - 60;


===Modifiers===

As an example of a modifier, consider increment,
which adds a given number of seconds to a Time object.
Again, a rough draft of this method looks like:

  public static void increment (Time time, double secs) 
    time.second += secs;

    if (time.second &gt;= 60.0) 
      time.second -= 60.0;
      time.minute += 1;
    
    if (time.minute &gt;= 60) 
      time.minute -= 60;
      time.hour += 1;


The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder
deals with the same cases we saw before.

Is this method correct?  What happens if the argument secs
is much greater than 60?  In that case, it is not enough to
subtract 60 once; we have to keep doing it until second
is below 60.  We can do that by simply replacing the if
statements with while statements:

  public static void increment (Time time, double secs) 
    time.second += secs;

    while (time.second &gt;= 60.0) 
      time.second -= 60.0;
      time.minute += 1;
    
    while (time.minute &gt;= 60) 
      time.minute -= 60;
      time.hour += 1;


This solution is correct, but not very efficient.
Can you think of a solution that does not require iteration?


===Fill-in methods===

Occasionally you will see methods like addTime written
with a different interface (different arguments and return values).
Instead of creating a new object every time addTime is
invoked, we could require the caller to provide an ``empty''
object where addTime should store the result.  Compare
the following with the previous version:

  public static void addTimeFill (Time t1, Time t2, Time sum) 
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour;
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute;
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second;

    if (sum.second &gt;= 60.0) 
      sum.second -= 60.0;
      sum.minute += 1;
    
    if (sum.minute &gt;= 60) 
      sum.minute -= 60;
      sum.hour += 1;


One advantage of this approach is that the caller has the option
of reusing the same object repeatedly to perform a series
of additions.  This can be slightly more efficient, although
it can be confusing enough to cause subtle errors.
For the vast majority of programming, it is worth
spending a little run time to avoid a lot of debugging time.


===Which is best?===

Anything that can be done with modifiers and fill-in methods can also
be done with pure functions.  In fact, there are programming
languages, called functional programming languages, that only
allow pure functions.  Some programmers believe that programs that use
pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than
programs that use modifiers.  Nevertheless, there are times when
modifiers are convenient, and some cases where functional programs
are less efficient.

In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever
it is reasonable to do so, and resort to modifiers only if there
is a compelling advantage.  This approach might be called a
functional programming style.


===Incremental development vs. planning===

In this chapter I have demonstrated an approach to program
development I refer to as rapid prototyping with iterative
improvement.  In each case, I wrote a rough draft (or prototype)
that performed the basic calculation, and then tested it on
a few cases, correcting flaws as I found them.

Although this approach can be effective, it can lead to code
that is unnecessarily complicated---since it deals with many
special cases---and unreliable---since it is hard to convince
yourself that you have found all the errors.

An alternative is high-level planning, in which a little insight
into the problem can make the programming much easier.  In
this case the insight is that a Time is really a three-digit
number in base 60!  The second is the ``ones column,''
the minute is the ''60's column'', and the hour
is the ''3600's column.''

When we wrote addTime and increment, we were effectively
doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to ``carry'' from one
column to the next.

Thus an alternate approach to the whole problem is to convert
Times into doubles and take advantage of the fact that
the computer already knows how to do arithmetic with doubles.
Here is a method that converts a Time into a double:

  public static double convertToSeconds (Time t) 
    int minutes = t.hour * 60 + t.minute;
    double seconds = minutes * 60 + t.second;
    return seconds;

Now all we need is a way to convert from a double
to a Time object.  We could write a method to
do it, but it might make more sense to write it as a third
constructor:

  public Time (double secs) 
    this.hour = (int) (secs / 3600.0);
    secs -= this.hour * 3600.0;
    this.minute = (int) (secs / 60.0);
    secs -= this.minute * 60;
    this.second = secs;


This constructor is a little different from the others, since
it involves some calculation along with assignments to the
instance variables.

You might have to think a bit to convince yourself that the technique
I am using to convert from one base to another is correct.  Assuming
you are convinced, we can use these methods to rewrite addTime:

  public static Time addTime (Time t1, Time t2) 
    double seconds = convertToSeconds (t1) + convertToSeconds (t2);
    return new Time (seconds);


This is much shorter than the original version, and it is much easier
to demonstrate that it is correct (assuming, as usual, that the
methods it invokes are correct).  As an exercise, rewrite 
increment the same way.


===Generalization===

In some ways converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is
harder than just dealing with times.  Base conversion is more
abstract; our intuition for dealing with times is better.

But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers,
and make the investment of writing the conversion methods
(convertToSeconds and the third constructor), we get
a program that is shorter, easier to read and debug, and more
reliable.

It is also easier to add more features later.  For example, imagine
subtracting two Times to find the duration between them.  The
naive approach would be to implement subtraction complete with
''borrowing.''  Using the conversion methods would be much easier.

Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (more general)
makes is easier (fewer special cases, fewer opportunities for error).


===Algorithms===

When you write a general solution for a class of problems, as
opposed to a specific solution to a single problem, you have
written an algorithm.  I mentioned this word in 
Chapter 1, but did not define it carefully.  It is
not easy to define, so I will try a couple of approaches.

First, consider some things that are not algorithms.  For example,
when you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably
memorized the multiplication table.  In effect, you memorized 100
specific solutions, so that knowledge is not really algorithmic.

But if you were ''lazy,'' you probably cheated by learning a few
tricks.  For example, to find the product of  and 9, you can
write  as the first digit and  as the second digit.  This
trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9.
That's an algorithm!

Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying,
subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms.  One
of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any
intelligence to carry out.  They are mechanical processes in which
each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.

In my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much
time in school learning to execute algorithms that,
quite literally, require no intelligence.

On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is
interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part
of what we call programming.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty
or conscious thought, are the most difficult to express
algorithmically.  Understanding natural language is a good
example.  We all do it, but so far no one has been able to
explain how we do it, at least not in the form of an
algorithm.

Later you will have the opportunity to design
simple algorithms for a variety of problems.

arrays
 array
 type!array

An array is a set of values where each value is identified by an
index.  You can make an array of ints, doubles, or any
other type, but all the values in an array have to have the same type.

Syntactically, array types look like other Java types except they are
followed by [].  For example, int[] is the type ``array of
integers'' and double[] is the type ``array of doubles.''

You can declare variables with these types in the usual ways:

verbatim
    int[] count;
    double[] values;
verbatim

Until you initialize these variables, they are set to null.
To create the array itself, use the new command.

verbatim
    count = new int[4];
    values = new double[size];
verbatim

The first assignment makes count refer to an array of 4
integers; the second makes values refer to an array of 
doubles.  The number of elements in values depends on 
size.  You can use any integer expression as an array
size.

 state diagram

The following figure shows how arrays are represented in state
diagrams:


figure=figs/array.eps


The large numbers inside the boxes are the elements of
the array.  The small numbers outside the boxes are the
indices used to identify each box.  When you allocate a new
array, the elements are initialized to zero.

===Accessing elements===
 element
 array!element

To store values in the array, use the
[] operator.  For example count[0] refers to the
``zeroeth'' element of the array, and count[1] refers to the
``oneth'' element.  You can use the [] operator anywhere in an
expression:

verbatim
    count[0] = 7;
    count[1] = count[0] * 2;
    count[2]++;
    count[3] -= 60;
verbatim

All of these are legal assignment statements.  Here is the
effect of this code fragment:


figure=figs/array2.eps


By now you should have noticed that the four elements of this array
are numbered from 0 to 3, which means that there is no element with
the index 4.  This should sound familiar, since we saw the same thing
with String indices.  Nevertheless, it is a common error to go
beyond the bounds of an array, which will cause an 
ArrayOutOfBoundsException.  As with all exceptions, you get an error
message and the program quits.

 exception!ArrayOutOfBounds
 run-time error
 index
 expression

You can use any expression as an index, as long as it has type 
int.  One of the most common ways to index an array is with a loop
variable.  For example:

verbatim
    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 4) 
      System.out.println (count[i]);
      i++;
    
verbatim

This is a standard while loop that counts from 0
up to 4, and when the loop variable i is 4, the
condition fails and the loop terminates.  Thus, the body
of the loop is only executed when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.

 loop
 loop variable
 variable!loop

Each time through the loop we use i as an index into
the array, printing the ith element.  This type of
array traversal is very common.  Arrays and loops go together
like fava beans and a nice Chianti.

 fava beans
 Chianti

===Copying arrays===
 array!copying

When you copy an array variable, remember that you are
copying a reference to the array.  For example:

verbatim
    double[] a = new double [3];
    double[] b = a;
verbatim

This code creates one array of three doubles, and
sets two different variables to refer to it.
This situation is a form of aliasing.


figure=figs/array3.eps


Any changes in either array
will be reflected in the other.  This is not usually the
behavior you want; instead, you should make a copy of the
array, by allocating a new array and copying each element from
one to the other.

verbatim
    double[] b = new double [3];

    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 4) 
      b[i] = a[i];
      i++;
    
verbatim

===for loops===

The loops we have written so far have a number of elements
in common.  All of them start by initializing a variable;
they have a test, or condition, that depends on that variable;
and inside the loop they do something to that variable,
like increment it.

 loop!for
 for
 statement!for

This type of loop is so common that there is an alternate
loop statement, called for, that expresses it more
concisely.  The general syntax looks like this:

verbatim
    for (INITIALIZER; CONDITION; INCREMENTOR) 
      BODY
    
verbatim

This statement is exactly equivalent to

verbatim
    INITIALIZER;
    while (CONDITION) 
      BODY
      INCREMENTOR
    
verbatim

except that it is more concise and, since it puts all the
loop-related statements in one place, it is easier to read.
For example:

verbatim
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) 
      System.out.println (count[i]);
    
verbatim

is equivalent to 

verbatim
    int i = 0;
    while (i &lt; 4) 
      System.out.println (count[i]);
      i++;
    
verbatim

As an exercise, write a for loop to copy the elements
of an array.

===Arrays and objects===
 object!compared to array
 array!compared to object

In many ways, arrays behave like objects:

itemize

When you declare an array variable, you get a reference
to an array.

You have to use the new command to create the array
itself.

When you pass an array as an argument, you pass a reference,
which means that the invoked method can change the contents
of the array.

itemize

Some of the objects we have looked at, like Rectangles, are
similar to arrays, in the sense that they are named collection of
values.  This raises the question, ``How is an array of 4 integers
different from a Rectangle object?''

 collection

If you go back to the definition of ``array'' at the beginning
of the chapter, you will see one difference, which is that the
elements of an array are identified by indices, whereas the
elements (instance variables) of an object have names
(like x, width, etc.).

Another difference between arrays and objects is that all the
elements of an array have to be the same type.  Although that
is also true of Rectangles, we have seen other objects
that have instance variables with different types (like
Time).

===Array length===
 length!array
 array!length

Actually, arrays do have one named instance variable: length.
Not surprisingly, it contains the length of the array (number
of elements).  It is a good idea to use this value as the upper
bound of a loop, rather than a constant value.  That way, if
the size of the array changes, you won't have to go through the
program changing all the loops; they will work correctly for any
size array.

verbatim
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++) 
      b[i] = a[i];
    
verbatim

The last time the body of the loop gets executed, i
is a.length - 1, which is the index of the last element.  When
i is equal to a.length, the condition fails and the body
is not executed, which is a good thing, since it would cause an
exception.  This code assumes that the array b contains at least
as many elements as a.

As an exercise, write a method called cloneArray that takes an
array of integers as a parameter, creates a new array that is the same
size, copies the elements from the first array into the new one, and
then returns a reference to the new array.

===Random numbers===
random
pseudorandom
 random number
 deterministic
 nondeterministic

Most computer programs do the same thing every time they are executed,
so they are said to be deterministic.  Usually, determinism is a
good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same
result.  For some applications, though, we would like the
computer to be unpredictable.  Games are an obvious example, but
there are many more.

Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not
so easy, but there are ways to make it at least seem
nondeterministic.  One of them is to generate random numbers and
use them to determine the outcome of the program.  Java provides
a built-in method that generates pseudorandom numbers, which
are not truly random in the mathematical sense, but 
for our purposes, they will do.

Check out the documentation of the random method in the 
Math class.  The return value is a double between 0.0 and 1.0.
Each time you invoke random you get a different
randomly-generated number.  To see a sample, run this loop:

verbatim
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
      double x = Math.random ();
      System.out.println (x);
    
verbatim

To generate a random double between 0.0 and an upper bound like
high, you can multiply x by high.  How would you
generate a random number between low and high?  How would
you generate a random integer?

===Statistics===
 statistics
 distribution
 mean

The numbers generated by random are supposed to be distributed
uniformly.  If you have taken statistics, you know what that means.
Among other things, it means that if we divide the range of possible
values into equal sized ``buckets,'' and count the number of times a
random value falls in each bucket, each bucket should get the same
number of hits (eventually).

In the next few sections, we will write programs that generate
a sequence of random numbers and check whether this property
holds true.

===Array of random numbers===

The first step is to generate a large number of random values
and store them in an array.  By ``large number,'' of course,
I mean 8.  It's always a good idea to start with a manageable
number, to help with debugging, and then increase it later.

The following method takes a single argument, the size of
the array.  It allocates a new array of doubles, fills
it with random values, and returns a reference to the new
array.

verbatim
  public static double[] randomArray (int n) 
    double[] a = new double[n];
    for (int i = 0; i&lt;a.length; i++) 
      a[i] = Math.random ();
    
    return a;
  
verbatim

The return type is double[], which means that
this method returns an array of doubles.
To test this method, it is convenient to have a method that
prints the contents of an array.

verbatim
  public static void printArray (double[] a) 
    for (int i = 0; i&lt;a.length; i++) 
      System.out.println (a[i]);
    
  
verbatim

The following code generates an array and prints it:

verbatim
    int numValues = 8;
    double[] array = randomArray (numValues);
    printArray (array);
verbatim

On my machine the output is

verbatim
0.7344558779885422
0.6224282219647016
0.09591424515329172
0.2992298398883563
0.7736458103088713
0.7069110192991597
0.7042440765950522
0.977839532249852
verbatim

which is pretty random-looking.  Your results may differ.

If these numbers are really random, we expect half of them to be
greater than 0.5 and half to be less.  In fact, six are greater than
0.5, so that's a little high.

If we divide the range into four buckets---from 0.0 to 0.25,
0.25 to 0.5, 0.5 to 0.75, and 0.75 to 1.0---we expect 2
values to fall in each bucket.  In fact, we get
1, 1, 4, 2.  Again, not exactly what we expected.

Do these results mean the values are not really random?  It's
hard to tell.  With so few values, the chances are slim
that we would get exactly what we expect.  But as the number
of values increases, the outcome should be more predictable.

To test this theory, we'll write some programs that divide the range
into buckets and count the number of values in each.

===Counting===
 traverse!array
 array!traverse
 looping and counting
 counter

A good approach to problems like this is to think of simple methods
that are easy to write, and that might turn out to be useful.  Then
you can combine them into a solution.  Of course, it is not easy to
know ahead of time which methods are likely to be useful, but as you
gain experience you will have a better idea.

Also, it is not always obvious what sort of things are easy to write,
but a good approach is to look for subproblems that fit a pattern you
have seen before.

Back in Section loopcount we looked at a loop that traversed a
string and counted the number of times a given letter appeared.  You
can think of this program as an example of a pattern called ``traverse
and count.''  The elements of this pattern are:

itemize

A set or container that can be traversed, like an array
or a string.

A test that you can apply to each element in the container.

A counter that keeps track of how many elements pass
the test.

itemize

In this case, I have a method in mind called inBucket
that counts the number of elements in an array that fall
in a given bucket.  The parameters are the array and two
doubles that specify the lower and upper bounds of
the bucket.

verbatim
  public static int inBucket (double[] a, double low, double high) 
    int count = 0;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++) 
      if (a[i] &gt;= low &amp;&amp; a[i] &lt; high) count++;
    
    return count;
  
verbatim

I haven't been very careful about whether something equal
to low or high falls in the bucket, but you can
see from the code that low is in and high is out.
That should prevent me from counting any elements twice.

Now, to divide the range into two pieces, we could write

verbatim
    int low = inBucket (a, 0.0, 0.5);
    int high = inBucket (a, 0.5, 1.0);
verbatim

To divide it into four pieces:

verbatim
    int bucket1 = inBucket (a, 0.0, 0.25);
    int bucket2 = inBucket (a, 0.25, 0.5);
    int bucket3 = inBucket (a, 0.5, 0.75);
    int bucket4 = inBucket (a, 0.75, 1.0);
verbatim

You might want to try out this program using a larger numValues.
As numValues increases, are the numbers in each bucket levelling
off?

===Many buckets===
 bucket
 histogram

Of course, as the number of buckets increases, we don't
want to have to rewrite the program, especially since the
code is getting big and repetitive.  Any time you find yourself
doing something more than a few times, you should be looking
for a way to automate it.

Let's say that we wanted 8 buckets.  The width of each
bucket would be one eighth of the range, which is 0.125.
To count the number of values in each bucket, we need to
be able to generate the bounds of each bucket automatically,
and we need to have some place to store the 8 counts.

We can solve the first problem with a loop:

verbatim
    int numBuckets = 8;
    double bucketWidth = 1.0 / numBuckets;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numBuckets; i++) 
      double low = i * bucketWidth;
      double high = low + bucketWidth;
      System.out.println (low + &quot; to &quot; + high);
    
verbatim

This code uses the loop variable i to multiply by the bucket
width, in order to find the low end of each bucket.  The output of
this loop is:

verbatim
0.0 to 0.125
0.125 to 0.25
0.25 to 0.375
0.375 to 0.5
0.5 to 0.625
0.625 to 0.75
0.75 to 0.875
0.875 to 1.0
verbatim

You can confirm that each bucket is the same width, that they
don't overlap, and that they cover the whole range from 0.0
to 1.0.

Now we just need a way to store 8 integers, preferably
so we can use an index to access each one.  Immediately,
you should be thinking ``array!''

What we want is an array of 8 integers, which we can allocate outside
the loop; then, inside the loop, we'll invoke inBucket and store
the result:

verbatim
    int numBuckets = 8;
    int[] buckets = new int [8];
    double bucketWidth = 1.0 / numBuckets;

    for (int i = 0; i&lt;numBuckets; i++) 
      double low = i * bucketWidth;
      double high = low + bucketWidth;
      //System.out.println (low + &quot; to &quot; + high);

      buckets[i] = inBucket (a, low, high);
    
verbatim

The tricky thing here is that I am using the loop variable
as an index into the buckets array, in addition to using
it to compute the range of each bucket.

This code works.  I cranked the number of values up to 1000
and divided the range into 8 buckets.  The output is:

verbatim
129
109
142
118
131
124
121
126
verbatim

which is pretty close to 125 in each bucket.  At least, it's
close enough that I can believe the random number generator is
working.

===A single-pass solution===

Although this code works, it is not as efficient as it could
be.  Every time it invokes inBucket, it traverses the
entire array.  As the number of buckets increases, that gets
to be a lot of traversals.

It would be better to make a single pass through the array,
and for each value, compute which bucket it falls in.  Then
we could increment the appropriate counter.

In the previous section, we took an index, i, and
multiplied it by the bucketWidth in order to find
the lower bound of a given bucket.  Now we want to take a
value in the range 0.0 to 1.0, and find the index of the
bucket where it falls.

Since this problem is the inverse of the previous problem we might
guess that we should divide by the bucketwidth instead of
multiplying.  That guess is correct.

Remember that since bucketWidth = 1.0 / numBuckets, dividing by
bucketWidth is the same as multiplying by numBuckets.
If we take a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and multiply by
numBuckets, we get a number in the range from 0.0
to numBuckets.  If we round that number to the next
lower integer, we get exactly what we are looking for---the
index of the appropriate bucket.

verbatim
    int numBuckets = 8;
    int[] buckets = new int [8];

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numValues; i++) 
      int index = (int) (a[i] * numBuckets);
      buckets[index]++;
    
verbatim

Here I am using a typecast to round the value down to the
next integer and convert it to type int at the same
time.

Is it possible for this calculation to produce an index
that is out of range (either negative or greater than
a.length-1)?  If so, how would you fix it?

 histogram

An array like buckets, that contains counts of the
number of values in each range, is called a histogram.
As an exercise, write a method called histogram
that takes an array and a number of buckets as parameters,
and that returns a histogram with the given number of
buckets.

===Composition===
 composition
 nested structure

By now we have seen several examples of composition (the ability to
combine language features in a variety of arrangements).  One of the
first examples we saw was using a method invocation as part of an
expression.  Another example is the nested structure of statements:
you can put an if statement within a while loop, or within
another if statement, etc.

Having seen this pattern, and having learned about arrays and objects,
you should not be surprised to learn that you can have arrays of
objects.  In fact, you can also have objects that contain arrays (as
instance variables); you can have arrays that contain arrays; you can
have objects that contain objects, and so on.

In the next two chapters we will look at some examples of these
combinations, using Card objects as an example.

Card objects
 Card
 class!Card

If you are not familiar with common playing cards, now would be a good
time to get a deck, or else this chapter might not make much sense.
There are 52 cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four
suits and one of 13 ranks.  The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and
Clubs (in descending order in Bridge).  The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and King.  Depending on what game you are
playing, the rank of the Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.

 rank
 suit

If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is
pretty obvious what the instance variables should be: rank and
suit.  It is not as obvious what type the instance variables
should be.  One possibility is Strings, containing things like
&quot;Spade&quot; for suits and &quot;Queen&quot; for ranks.  One problem with
this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to
see which had higher rank or suit.

 encode
 encrypt
 map to

An alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and
suits.  By ``encode,'' I do not mean what some people think, which
is to encrypt, or translate into a secret code.  What a computer
scientist means by ``encode'' is something like ``define a mapping
between a sequence of numbers and the things I want to represent.''
For example,


tabularl c l

Hearts &amp;  &amp; 2 
Diamonds &amp;  &amp; 1 
Clubs &amp;  &amp; 0
tabular



The obvious feature of this mapping is that the suits map to
integers in order, so we can compare suits by comparing integers.
The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical
ranks maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:


tabularl c l

Queen &amp;  &amp; 12 
King &amp;  &amp; 13 
tabular



that they are not part of the Java program.  They are part of the
program design, but they never appear explicitly in the code.
The class definition for the Card type looks like this:

verbatim
class Card

  int suit, rank;

  public Card ()  
    this.suit = 0;  this.rank = 0;
  

  public Card (int suit, int rank)  
    this.suit = suit;  this.rank = rank;
  

verbatim

As usual, I am providing two constructors, one of which takes
a parameter for each instance variable and the other of which
takes no parameters.

 constructor

To create an object that represents the 3 of Clubs, we would
use the new command:

verbatim
   Card threeOfClubs = new Card (0, 3);
verbatim

The first argument, 0 represents the suit Clubs.

===The printCard method===
 printCard
 print!Card

When you create a new class, the first step is usually to declare the
instance variables and write constructors.  The second step is often
to write the standard methods that every object should have, including
one that prints the object, and one or two that compare objects.  I
will start with printCard.

 String!array of
 array!of String

In order to print Card objects in a way that humans
can read easily, we want to map the integer codes onto words.
A natural way to do that is with an array of Strings.  You
can create an array of Strings the same way you create an
array of primitive types:

verbatim
    String[] suits = new String [4];
verbatim

Then we can set the values of the elements of the array.

verbatim
    suits[0] = &quot;Clubs&quot;;
    suits[1] = &quot;Diamonds&quot;;
    suits[2] = &quot;Hearts&quot;;
    suits[3] = &quot;Spades&quot;;
verbatim

Creating an array and initializing the elements is such a common
operation that Java provides a special syntax for it:

verbatim
    String[] suits =  &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot; ;
verbatim

The effect of this statement is identical to that of the
separate declaration, allocation, and assignment.  A state
diagram of this array might look like:

 state diagram


figure=figs/stringarray.eps


 reference
 String!reference to

The elements of the array are references to the Strings,
rather than Strings themselves.  This is true of all arrays of
objects, as I will discuss in more detail later.  For now, all we need
is another array of Strings to decode the ranks:

verbatim
  String[] ranks =  &quot;narf&quot;, &quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;,
               &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot; ;
verbatim

The reason for the &quot;narf&quot; is to act as a place-keeper
for the zeroeth element of the array, which will never be
used.  The only valid ranks are 1--13.  This wasted entry is not
necessary, of course.  We could have started at 0, as usual, but
it is best to encode 2 as 2, and 3 as 3, etc.

Using these arrays, we can select the appropriate Strings by
using the suit and rank as indices.  In the method
printCard,

verbatim
public static void printCard (Card c) 
    String[] suits =  &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot; ;
    String[] ranks =  &quot;narf&quot;, &quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;,
                 &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot; ;

    System.out.println (ranks[c.rank] + &quot; of &quot; + suits[c.suit]);

verbatim

the expression suits[c.suit] means ``use the instance variable
suit from the object c as an index into the array named
suits, and select the appropriate string.''  The output of this
code

verbatim
    Card card = new Card (1, 11);
    printCard (card);
verbatim

is Jack of Diamonds.

The sameCard method
 sameCard

The word ``same'' is one of those things that occur in natural
language that seem perfectly clear until you give it some thought,
and then you realize there is more to it than you expected.

 ambiguity
 natural language
 language!

For example, if I say ``Chris and I have the same car,'' I
mean that his car and mine are the same make and model, but they are
two different cars.  If I say ``Chris and I have the same mother,'' I
mean that his mother and mine are one and the same.  So the
idea of ``sameness'' is different depending on the context.

When you talk about objects, there is a similar ambiguity.  For
example, if two Cards are the same, does that mean they
contain the same data (rank and suit), or they are actually
the same Card object?

To see if two references refer to the same object, we can use
the == operator.  For example:

verbatim
    Card card1 = new Card (1, 11);
    Card card2 = card1;

    if (card1 == card2) 
      System.out.println (&quot;card1 and card2 are the same object.&quot;);
    
verbatim

This type of equality is called shallow equality because
it only compares the references, not the contents of the objects.

 equality
 identity
 shallow equality
 deep equality

To compare the contents of the objects---deep equality---it
is common to write a method with a name like sameCard.

verbatim
public static boolean sameCard (Card c1, Card c2) 
    return (c1.suit == c2.suit &amp;&amp; c1.rank == c2.rank);

verbatim

Now if we create two different objects that contain the same
data, we can use sameCard to see if they represent the
same card:

verbatim
    Card card1 = new Card (1, 11);
    Card card2 = new Card (1, 11);

    if (sameCard (card1, card2)) 
      System.out.println (&quot;card1 and card2 are the same card.&quot;);
    
verbatim

In this case, card1 and card2
are two different objects that contain the same data


figure=figs/card.eps


so the condition is true.  What does the state diagram look like when
card1 == card2 is true?

 aliasing

In Section incomparable I said that you should never use the 
&lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt; operator on Strings because it does not do what you
expect.  Instead of comparing the contents of the String
(deep equality), it checks whether the two Strings are the
same object (shallow equality).

===The compareCard method===
 compareCard
 operator!conditional
 conditional operator

For primitive types, there are conditional operators that
compare values and determine when one is greater or less
than another.  These operators (&lt; and &gt; and the others)
don't work for object types.  For Strings there is
a built-in compareTo method.  For Cards we have
to write our own, which we will call compareCard.
Later, we will use this method to sort a deck of cards.

 ordering
 complete ordering
 partial ordering

Some sets are completely ordered, which means that you can
compare any two elements and tell which is bigger.  For
example, the integers and the floating-point numbers are
totally ordered.  Some sets are unordered, which means that
there is no meaningful way to say that one element is bigger
than another.  For example, the fruits are unordered, which
is why we cannot compare apples and oranges.  In Java,
the boolean type is unordered; we cannot say that
true is greater than false.

The set of playing cards is partially ordered, which means that
sometimes we can compare cards and sometimes not.  For example, I know
that the 3 of Clubs is higher than the 2 of Clubs, and the 3 of
Diamonds is higher than the 3 of Clubs.  But which is better, the 3 of
Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds?  One has a higher rank, but the other has
a higher suit.

 comparable

In order to make cards comparable, we have to decide which is more
important, rank or suit.  To be honest, the choice is completely
arbitrary.  For the sake of choosing, I will say that suit is more
important, because when you buy a new deck of cards, it comes sorted
with all the Clubs together, followed by all the Diamonds, and so on.

With that decided, we can write compareCard.  It
will take two Cards as parameters and return 1 if
the first card wins, -1 if the second card wins, and 0 if
they tie (indicating deep equality).  It is sometimes confusing
to keep those return values straight, but they are pretty
standard for comparison methods.

First we compare the suits:

verbatim
    if (c1.suit &gt; c2.suit) return 1;
    if (c1.suit &lt; c2.suit) return -1;
verbatim

If neither statement is true, then the suits must be equal,
and we have to compare ranks:

verbatim
    if (c1.rank &gt; c2.rank) return 1;
    if (c1.rank &lt; c2.rank) return -1;
verbatim

If neither of these is true, the ranks must be equal,
so we return 0.  In this ordering, aces will appear
lower than deuces (2s).

As an exercise, fix it so that aces are ranked higher than Kings, and
encapsulate this code in a method.


===Arrays of cards===
 array!of object
 object!array of
 deck

The reason I chose Cards as the objects for this chapter is that
there is an obvious use for an array of cards---a deck.  Here is some
code that creates a new deck of 52 cards:

verbatim
    Card[] deck = new Card [52];
verbatim

Here is the state diagram for this object:

 state diagram


figure=figs/cardarray.eps


The important thing to see here is that the array contains
only references to objects; it does not contain any
Card objects.  The values of the array elements are
initialized to null.  You can access the elements of
the array in the usual way:

verbatim
    if (deck[3] == null) 
      System.out.println (&quot;No cards yet!&quot;);
    
verbatim

But if you try to access the instance variables of the
non-existent Cards, you will get a NullPointerException.

 exception!NullPointer
 run-time error
 null

verbatim
    deck[2].rank;             // NullPointerException
verbatim

Nevertheless, that is the correct syntax for accessing the rank
of the ``twoeth'' card in the deck (really the third---we started
at zero, remember?).  This is another example of composition, the
combination of the syntax for accessing an element of an array
and an instance variable of an object.

 composition
 loop!nested

The easiest way to populate the deck with Card objects
is to write a nested loop:

verbatim
    int index = 0;
    for (int suit = 0; suit &lt;= 3; suit++) 
      for (int rank = 1; rank &lt;= 13; rank++) 
        deck[index] = new Card (suit, rank);
        index++;
      
    
verbatim

The outer loop enumerates the suits, from 0 to 3.  For
each suit, the inner loop enumerates the ranks, from 1
to 13.  Since the outer loop iterates 4 times, and
the inner loop iterates 13 times, the total number of times
the body is executed is 52 (13 times 4).

 index

I used the variable index to keep track of where in the
deck the next card should go.  The following state diagram
shows what the deck looks like after the first two cards
have been allocated:


figure=figs/cardarray2.eps


As an exercise, encapsulate this deck-building code in a method called
buildDeck that takes no parameters and that returns a
fully-populated array of Cards.

 encapsulation

===The printDeck method===
printdeck
 printDeck
 print!array of Cards

Whenever you are working with arrays, it is convenient to have
a method that will print the contents of the array.  We have
seen the pattern for traversing an array several times, so the
following method should be familiar:

verbatim
  public static void printDeck (Card[] deck) 
    for (int i=0; i&lt;deck.length; i++) 
      printCard (deck[i]);
    
  
verbatim

Since deck has type Card[], an element of deck
has type Card.  Therefore, deck[i] is a legal argument
for printCard.

===Searching===
findcard
 searching
 linear search
 findCard

The next method I want to write is findCard, which searches
through an array of Cards to see whether it contains a certain
card.  It may not be obvious why this method would be useful, but it
gives me a chance to demonstrate two ways to go searching for things,
a linear search and a bisection search.

 traverse
 loop!search

Linear search is the more obvious of the two; it involves traversing
the deck and comparing each card to the one we are looking for.  If we
find it we return the index where the card appears.  If it is not in
the deck, we return -1.

verbatim
  public static int findCard (Card[] deck, Card card) 
    for (int i = 0; i&lt; deck.length; i++) 
      if (sameCard (deck[i], card)) return i;
    
    return -1;
  
verbatim

The arguments of findCard are named card and deck.
It might seem odd to have a variable with the same name as a type (the
card variable has type Card).  This is legal and common,
although it can sometimes make code hard to read.  In this case,
though, I think it works.

 statement!return
 return!inside loop

The method returns as soon as it discovers
the card, which means that we do not have to traverse the entire
deck if we find the card we are looking for.  If the loop terminates
without finding the card, we know the card is not in the deck
and return -1.

If the cards in the deck are not in order, there is no way to search
that is faster than this.  We have to look at every card, since
otherwise there is no way to be certain the card we want is not
there.

 bisection search

But when you look for a word in a dictionary, you don't search
linearly through every word.  The reason is that the words are in
alphabetical order.  As a result, you probably use an algorithm that
is similar to a bisection search:

 enumerate

Start in the middle somewhere.

Choose a word on the page and compare it to the word you
are looking for.

If you found the word you are looking for, stop.

If the word you are looking for comes after the word on
the page, flip to somewhere later in the dictionary and go to
step 2.

If the word you are looking for comes before the word on
the page, flip to somewhere earlier in the dictionary and go to
step 2.

 enumerate

If you ever get to the point where there are two adjacent
words on the page and your word comes between them, you can
conclude that your word is not in the dictionary.
The only alternative is that your word has been misfiled somewhere,
but that contradicts our assumption that the words are in alphabetical
order.

In the case of a deck of cards, if we know that the cards are
in order, we can write a version of findCard that is
much faster.  The best way to write a bisection
search is with a recursive method.  That's because bisection
is naturally recursive.

 findBisect

The trick is to write a method called findBisect that takes
two indices as parameters, low and high, indicating the
segment of the array that should be searched (including both
low and high).

enumerate

To search the array, choose an index between low and 
high (call it mid) and compare it to the card you are looking
for.

If you found it, stop.

If the card at mid is higher than your card, search
in the range from low to mid-1.

If the card at mid is lower than your card, search
in the range from mid+1 to high.

enumerate

Steps 3 and 4 look suspiciously like recursive
invocations.  Here's what this all looks like translated into
Java code:

verbatim
  public static int findBisect (Card[] deck, Card card, int low, int high) 
    int mid = (high + low) / 2;
    int comp = compareCard (deck[mid], card);

    if (comp == 0) 
      return mid;
     else if (comp &gt; 0) 
      return findBisect (deck, card, low, mid-1);
     else 
      return findBisect (deck, card, mid+1, high);
    
  
verbatim

Rather than call compareCard three times, I called it once
and stored the result.

Although this code contains the kernel of a bisection search, it
is still missing a piece.  As it is currently written,
if the card is not in the deck, it will recurse forever.  We
need a way to detect this condition and deal with it properly
(by returning -1).

 recursion

The easiest way to tell that your card is not in the deck
is if there are no cards in the deck, which is the
case if high is less than low.  Well, there are
still cards in the deck, of course, but what I mean is that
there are no cards in the segment of the deck indicated by
low and high.

With that line added, the method works correctly:

verbatim
  public static int findBisect
               (Card[] deck, Card card, int low, int high) 
    System.out.println (low + &quot;, &quot; + high);

    if (high &lt; low) return -1;

    int mid = (high + low) / 2;
    int comp = deck[mid].compareCard (card);

    if (comp == 0) 
      return mid;
     else if (comp &gt; 0) 
      return findBisect (deck, card, low, mid-1);
     else 
      return findBisect (deck, card, mid+1, high);
    
  
verbatim

I added a print statement at the beginning so I could watch
the sequence of recursive calls and convince myself
that it would eventually reach the base case.  I tried out the
following code:

verbatim
    Card card1 = new Card (1, 11);
    System.out.println (findBisect (deck, card1, 0, 51));
verbatim

And got the following output:

verbatim
0, 51
0, 24
13, 24
19, 24
22, 24
23
verbatim

Then I made up a card that is not in the deck (the 15 of Diamonds),
and tried to find it.  I got the following:

verbatim
0, 51
0, 24
13, 24
13, 17
13, 14
13, 12
-1
verbatim

These tests don't prove that this program is correct.  In fact, no
amount of testing can prove that a program is correct.  On the other
hand, by looking at a few cases and examining the code, you might be
able to convince yourself.

 testing
 correctness

The number of recursive calls is fairly small, typically 6 or 7.
That means we only had to invoke compareCard 6 or 7 times,
compared to up to 52 times if we did a linear search.  In general,
bisection is much faster than a linear search, especially for
large arrays.

Two common errors in recusive programs are forgetting to include a
base case and writing the recursive call so that the base case is never
reached.  Either error will cause an infinite recursion, in which case
Java will (eventually) throw a StackOverflowException.

 recursion!infinite
 infinite recursion
 exception!StackOverflow

===Decks and subdecks===
 deck
 subdeck

Looking at the interface to findBisect

verbatim
  public static int findBisect
	       (Card[] deck, Card card, int low, int high)
verbatim

it might make sense to treat three of the parameters, deck, 
low and high, as a single parameter that specifies a 
subdeck.  We took a similar view in Section graphics when we
were talking about bounding boxes.  In that case I referred to 
x, y, width and height as if they were a single
parameter, a bounding box.

 parameter!abstract
 abstract parameter

This kind of thing is quite common, and I sometimes think of it as an
abstract parameter.  What I mean by ``abstract,'' is something
that is not literally part of the program text, but which describes the
function of the program at a higher level.

For example, when you invoke a method and pass an array and the bounds
low and high, there is nothing that prevents the invoked
method from accessing parts of the array that are out of bounds.  So
you are not literally sending a subset of the deck; you are really
sending the whole deck.  But as long as the recipient plays by the
rules, it makes sense to think of it, abstractly, as a subdeck.

There is one other example of this kind of abstraction that you might
have noticed in Section objectops, when I referred to an
``empty'' data structure.  The reason I put ``empty'' in quotation
marks was to suggest that it is not literally accurate.  All variables
have values all the time.  When you create them, they are given
default values.  So there is no such thing as an empty object.

But if the program guarantees that the current value of a variable is
never read before it is written, then the current value is irrelevant.
Abstractly, it makes sense to think of such a variable as ``empty.''

This kind of thinking, in which a program comes to take on
meaning beyond what is literally encoded, is a very important
part of thinking like a computer scientist.  Sometimes,
the word ``abstract'' gets used so often and in so many contexts
that it comes to lose its meaning.  Nevertheless, abstraction
is a central idea in computer science (as well as many other
fields).

 abstraction

A more general definition of ``abstraction'' is ``The process of
modeling a complex system with a simplified description in order to
suppress unnecessary details while capturing relevant behavior.''

deck
 deck
 array!of Cards

In the previous chapter, we worked with an array of objects,
but I also mentioned that it is possible to have an object
that contains an array as an instance variable.  In this
chapter I am going to create a new object, called a Deck,
that contains an array of Cards as an instance variable.

 instance variable
 variable!instance

The class definition looks like this

verbatim
class Deck 
  Card[] cards;

  public Deck (int n) 
    cards = new Card[n];
  

verbatim

The name of the instance variable is cards to help
distinguish the Deck object from the array of Cards
that it contains.  Here is a state diagram showing what a
Deck object looks like with no cards allocated:

 state diagram
 constructor


figure=figs/deckobject.eps


As usual, the constructor initializes the instance variable, but in
this case it uses the new command to create the array of cards.
It doesn't create any cards to go in it, though.  For that we could
write another constructor that creates a standard 52-card deck and
populates it with Card objects:

verbatim
  public Deck () 
    cards = new Card[52];
    int index = 0;
    for (int suit = 0; suit &lt;= 3; suit++) 
      for (int rank = 1; rank &lt;= 13; rank++) 
        cards[index] = new Card (suit, rank);
        index++;
      
    
  
verbatim

Notice how similar this method is to buildDeck, except
that we had to change the syntax to make it a constructor.
To invoke it, we use the new command:

 new
 statement!new

verbatim
    Deck deck = new Deck ();
verbatim

Now that we have a Deck class, it makes sense to put
all the methods that pertain to Decks in the Deck
class definition.  Looking at the methods we have written so
far, one obvious candidate is printDeck (Section printdeck).
Here's how it looks, rewritten to work with a Deck
object:

 printDeck

verbatim
  public static void printDeck (Deck deck) 
    for (int i=0; i&lt;deck.cards.length; i++) 
      Card.printCard (deck.cards[i]);
    
  
verbatim

The most obvious thing we have to change is the type of the parameter,
from Card[] to Deck.  The second change is that we can no
longer use deck.length to get the length of the array, because
deck is a Deck object now, not an array.  It contains an
array, but it is not, itself, an array.  Therefore, we have to write
deck.cards.length to extract the array from the Deck
object and get the length of the array.

For the same reason, we have to use deck.cards[i] to access an
element of the array, rather than just deck[i].  The last change
is that the invocation of printCard has to say explicitly that
printCard is defined in the Card class.

For some of the other methods, it is not obvious whether they should
be included in the Card class or the Deck class.  For
example, findCard takes a Card and a Deck as
arguments; you could reasonably put it in either class.  As an
exercise, move findCard into the Deck class and rewrite it
so that the first parameter is a Deck object rather than an
array of Cards.

===Shuffling===
shuffle
 shuffling

For most card games you need to be able to shuffle the deck;
that is, put the cards in a random order.  In Section random
we saw how to generate random numbers, but it is not obvious how
to use them to shuffle a deck.

One possibility is to model the way humans shuffle, which is usually
by dividing the deck in two and then reassembling the deck by choosing
alternately from each deck.  Since humans usually don't shuffle
perfectly, after about 7 iterations the order of the deck is pretty
well randomized.  But a computer program would have the annoying
property of doing a perfect shuffle every time, which is not really
very random.  In fact, after 8 perfect shuffles, you would find the
deck back in the same order you started in.  For a discussion of that
claim, see http://www.wiskit.com/marilyn/craig.html or do a web
search with the keywords ``perfect shuffle.''

A better shuffling algorithm is to traverse the deck one card at a
time, and at each iteration choose two cards and swap them.

 pseudocode

Here is an outline of how this algorithm works.  To sketch the
program, I am using a combination of Java statements and English
words that is sometimes called pseudocode:

verbatim
    for (int i=0; i&lt;deck.cards.length; i++) 
      // choose a random number between i and deck.cards.length
      // swap the ith card and the randomly-chosen card
    
verbatim

The nice thing about using pseudocode is that it often makes it
clear what methods you are going to need.  In this case, we
need something like randomInt, which chooses a random
integer between the parameters low and high,
and swapCards which takes two indices and switches the
cards at the indicated positions.

 random number

You can probably figure out how to write randomInt
by looking at Section random, although you will have to
be careful about possibly generating indices that are out of range.

 swapCards
 reference

You can also figure out swapCards yourself.  The only
tricky thing is to decide whether to swap just the references
to the cards or the contents of the cards.  Does it matter
which one you choose?  Which is faster?

I will leave the remaining implementation of these methods
as an exercise to the reader.

===Sorting===
sorting
 sorting

Now that we have messed up the deck, we need a way to put it
back in order.  Ironically, there is an algorithm for
sorting that is very similar to the algorithm for shuffling.
This algorithm is sometimes called selection sort
because it works by traversing the array repeatedly and 
selecting the lowest remaining card each time.

 selection sort

During the first iteration we find the lowest card and swap
it with the card in the 0th position.  During the ith, we find the
lowest card to the right of i and swap it with the ith
card.

Here is pseudocode for selection sort:

verbatim
    for (int i=0; i&lt;deck.cards.length; i++) 
      // find the lowest card at or to the right of i
      // swap the ith card and the lowest card
    
verbatim

Again, the pseudocode helps with the design of the helper
methods.  In this case we can use swapCards again,
so we only need one new one, called findLowestCard,
that takes an array of cards and an index where it should
start looking.

 helper method
 method!helper

Once again, I am going to leave the implementation up to
the reader.


===Subdecks===
 subdeck

How should we represent a hand or some other subset of a full deck?
One good choice is to make a Deck object that
has fewer than 52 cards.

We might want a method, subdeck, that takes an array of cards
and a range of indices, and that returns a new array of cards that
contains the specified subset of the deck:

verbatim
  public static Deck subdeck (Deck deck, int low, int high) 
    Deck sub = new Deck (high-low+1);
	
    for (int i = 0; i&lt;sub.cards.length; i++) 
      sub.cards[i] = deck.cards[low+i];
    
    return sub;
  
verbatim

The length of the subdeck is high-low+1 because both the low
card and high card are included.  This sort of computation can be
confusing, and lead to ``off-by-one'' errors.  Drawing a picture is
usually the best way to avoid them.

 constructor
 overloading

Because we provide an argument with the new command, the
contructor that gets invoked will be the first one, which only
allocates the array and doesn't allocate any cards.  Inside the
for loop, the subdeck gets populated with copies of the
references from the deck.

The following is a state diagram of a subdeck being created with the
parameters low=3 and high=7.  The result is a hand with 5
cards that are shared with the original deck; i.e. they are aliased.


figure=figs/subdeck.eps


 aliasing
 reference

I have suggested that aliasing is not generally a good idea, since
changes in one subdeck will be reflected in others, which is not the
behavior you would expect from real cards and decks.  But if the
objects in question are immutable, then aliasing can be a reasonable
choice.  In this case, there is probably no reason ever to change the
rank or suit of a card.  Instead we will create each card
once and then treat it as an immutable object.  So for Cards
aliasing is a reasonable choice.

As an exercise, write a version of findBisect that takes a
subdeck as an argument, rather than a deck and an index range.  Which
version is more error-prone?  Which version do you think is more
efficient?

===Shuffling and dealing===
 shuffling
 dealing

In Section shuffle I wrote pseudocode for a shuffling algorithm.
Assuming that we have a method called shuffleDeck that takes
a deck as an argument and shuffles it, we can create and shuffle
a deck:

verbatim
    Deck deck = new Deck ();
    shuffleDeck (deck);
verbatim

Then, to deal out several hands, we can use subdeck:

verbatim
   Deck hand1 = subdeck (deck, 0, 4);
   Deck hand2 = subdeck (deck, 5, 9);
   Deck pack = subdeck (deck, 10, 51);
verbatim

This code puts the first 5 cards in one hand, the next 5 cards
in the other, and the rest into the pack.

When you thought about dealing, did you think we should give out one
card at a time to each player in the round-robin style that is common
in real card games?  I thought about it, but then realized that it is
unnecessary for a computer program.  The round-robin convention is
intended to mitigate imperfect shuffling and make it more difficult
for the dealer to cheat.  Neither of these is an issue for a computer.

This example is a useful reminder of one of the dangers of engineering
metaphors: sometimes we impose restrictions on computers that are
unnecessary, or expect capabilities that are lacking, because we
unthinkingly extend a metaphor past its breaking point.  Beware of
misleading analogies.

===Mergesort===
mergesort
 efficiency
 sorting
 mergesort

In Section sorting, we saw a simple sorting algorithm that turns
out not to be very efficient.  In order to sort  items, it has to
traverse the array  times, and each traversal takes an amount of
time that is proportional to .  The total time, therefore, is
proportional to .

In this section I will sketch a more efficient algorithm called 
mergesort.  To sort  items, mergesort takes time proportional to
.  That may not seem impressive, but as  gets big, the
difference between  and  can be enormous.  Try out a
few values of  and see.

The basic idea behind mergesort is this: if you have two subdecks,
each of which has been sorted, it is easy (and fast) to merge them
into a single, sorted deck.  Try this out with a deck of cards:

enumerate

Form two subdecks with about 10 cards each and sort
them so that when they are face up the lowest cards are on
top.  Place both decks face up in front of you.

Compare the top card from each deck and choose the
lower one.  Flip it over and add it to the merged deck.

Repeat step two until one of the decks is empty.
Then take the remaining cards and add them to the merged
deck.

enumerate

The result should be a single sorted deck.  Here's what this
looks like in pseudocode:

verbatim
  public static Deck merge (Deck d1, Deck d2) 
    // create a new deck big enough for all the cards
    Deck result = new Deck (d1.cards.length + d2.cards.length);

    // use the index i to keep track of where we are in
    // the first deck, and the index j for the second deck
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
		
    // the index k traverses the result deck
    for (int k = 0; k&lt;result.cards.length; k++) 
			
      // if d1 is empty, d2 wins; if d2 is empty, d1 wins;
      // otherwise, compare the two cards
			
      // add the winner to the new deck
    
    return result;
  
verbatim

The best way to test merge is to build and shuffle a deck,
use subdeck to form two (small) hands, and then use the sort
routine from the previous chapter to sort the two halves.  Then
you can pass the two halves to merge to see if it works.

 testing

If you can get that working, try a simple implementation of
mergeSort:

verbatim
  public static Deck mergeSort (Deck deck) 
    // find the midpoint of the deck
    // divide the deck into two subdecks
    // sort the subdecks using sortDeck
    // merge the two halves and return the result
  
verbatim

Then, if you get that working, the real fun begins!  The magical thing
about mergesort is that it is recursive.  At the point where you sort
the subdecks, why should you invoke the old, slow version of 
sort?  Why not invoke the spiffy new mergeSort you are in the
process of writing?

 recursion

Not only is that a good idea, it is necessary in order to
achieve the performance advantage I promised.  In order to make it
work, though, you have to add a base case so that it doesn't recurse
forever.  A simple base case is a subdeck with 0 or 1 cards.  If 
mergesort receives such a small subdeck, it can return it
unmodified, since it is already sorted.

The recursive version of mergesort should look something
like this:

verbatim
  public static Deck mergeSort (Deck deck) 
    // if the deck is 0 or 1 cards, return it

    // find the midpoint of the deck
    // divide the deck into two subdecks
    // sort the subdecks using mergesort
    // merge the two halves and return the result
  
verbatim

As usual, there are two ways to think about recursive programs:
you can think through the entire flow of execution, or you
can make the ``leap of faith.''  I have deliberately constructed
this example to encourage you to make the leap of faith.

 leap of faith

When you were using sortDeck to sort the subdecks, you didn't
feel compelled to follow the flow of execution, right?  You just
assumed that the sortDeck method would work because you already
debugged it.  Well, all you did to make mergeSort recursive was
replace one sort algorithm with another.  There is no reason to read
the program differently.

Well, actually you have to give some thought to getting the
base case right and making sure that you reach it eventually,
but other than that, writing the recursive version should be
no problem.  Good luck!

===Programming languages and styles===
 programming language
 language!programming
 programming style
 object-oriented programming
 functional programming
 procedural programming
 programming!object-oriented
 programming!functional
 programming!procedural

There are many programming languages in the world, and almost as many
programming styles (sometimes called paradigms).  Three styles that
have appeared in this book are procedural, functional, and
object-oriented.  Although Java is usually thought of as an
object-oriented language, it is possible to write Java programs in any
style.  The style I have demonstrated in this book is pretty much
procedural.  Existing Java programs and the built-in Java packages are
written in a mixture of all three styles, but they tend to be more
object-oriented than the programs in this book.

It's not easy to define what object-oriented programming is,
but here are some of its characteristics:

itemize

Object definitions (classes) usually correspond to 
relevant real-world objects.  For example, in Chapter deck,
the creation of the Deck class was a step toward object-oriented
programming.

The majority of methods are object methods (the kind you
invoke on an object) rather than class methods (the kind you just
invoke).  So far all the methods we have written have been class
methods.  In this chapter we will write some object methods.

The language feature most associated with object-oriented
programming is inheritance.  I will cover inheritance later in
this chapter.

itemize

 inheritance

Recently object-oriented programming has become quite popular, and
there are people who claim that it is superior to other styles in
various ways.  I hope that by exposing you to a variety of styles I
have given you the tools you need to understand and evaluate these
claims.

===Object and class methods===
 object method
 method!object
 class method
 method!class
 static

There are two types of methods in Java, called class methods and
object methods.  So far, every method we have written has been a
class method.  Class methods are identified by the keyword 
static in the first line.  Any method that does not have the keyword
static is an object method.

Although we have not written any object methods, we have invoked some.
Whenever you invoke a method ``on'' an object, it's an object method.
For example, drawOval is an object method we invoked on g,
which is a Graphics object.  Also, the methods we invoked on
Strings in Chapter strings were object methods.

 Graphics
 class!Graphics

Anything that can be written as a class method can also be written as an
object method, and vice versa.  Sometimes it is just more natural to
use one or the other.  For reasons that will be clear soon, object
methods are often shorter than the corresponding class methods.

===The current object===
 current object
 object!current
 this

When you invoke a method on an object, that object becomes the
current object.  Inside the method, you can refer to the instance
variables of the current object by name, without having to specify the
name of the object.

 constructor

Also, you can refer to the current object using the keyword 
this.  We have already seen this used in constructors.  In
fact, you can think of constructors as being a special kind of object
method.

===Complex numbers===
 complex number
 Complex
 class!Complex
 arithmetic!complex

As a running example for the rest of this chapter we will consider a
class definition for complex numbers.  Complex numbers are useful for
many branches of mathematics and engineering, and many computations
are performed using complex arithmetic.  A complex number is the sum
of a real part and an imaginary part, and is usually written in the
form , where  is the real part,  is the imaginary part,
and  represents the square root of -1.
Thus, .

The following is a class definition for a new object type called 
Complex:

verbatim
class Complex

  // instance variables
  double real, imag;

  // constructor
  public Complex () 
    this.real = 0.0;  this.imag = 0.0;
  
	
  // constructor
  public Complex (double real, double imag) 
    this.real = real;  this.imag = imag;
  

verbatim

There should be nothing surprising here.  The instance variables
are two doubles that contain the real and imaginary parts.
The two constructors are the usual kind: one takes no parameters
and assigns default values to the instance variables, the other
takes parameters that are identical to the instance variables.
As we have seen before, the keyword this is used to refer
to the object being initialized.

 instance variable
 variable!instance
 constructor

In main, or anywhere else we want to create Complex
objects, we have the option of creating the object and then
setting the instance variables, or doing both at the same time:

verbatim
    Complex x = new Complex ();
    x.real = 1.0;
    x.imag = 2.0;
    Complex y = new Complex (3.0, 4.0);
verbatim

===A function on Complex numbers===
 operator!Complex
 method!function
 pure function

Let's look at some of the operations we might want to perform
on complex numbers.  The absolute value of a complex number is
defined to be .  The abs method is
a pure function that computes the absolute value.  Written as
a class method, it looks like this:

verbatim
  // class method
  public static double abs (Complex c) 
    return Math.sqrt (c.real * c.real + c.imag * c.imag);
   
verbatim

This version of abs calculates the absolute value of c,
the Complex object it receives as a parameter.  The next version
of abs is an object method; it calculates the absolute value of
the current object (the object the method was invoked on).  Thus,
it does not receive any parameters:

verbatim
  // object method
  public double abs () 
    return Math.sqrt (real*real + imag*imag);
  
verbatim

I removed the keyword static to indicate that this is an object
method.  Also, I eliminated the unnecessary parameter.  Inside the
method, I can refer to the instance variables real and 
imag by name without having to specify an object.  Java knows
implicitly that I am referring to the instance variables of the
current object.  If I wanted to make it explicit, I could have used
the keyword this:

verbatim
  // object method
  public double abs () 
    return Math.sqrt (this.real * this.real + this.imag * this.imag);
  
verbatim

But that would be longer and not really any clearer.  To invoke
this method, we invoke it on an object, for example

verbatim
    Complex y = new Complex (3.0, 4.0);
    double result = y.abs();
verbatim

===Another function on Complex numbers===

Another operation we might want to perform on complex numbers
is addition.  You can add complex numbers by adding the real
parts and adding the imaginary parts.  Written as a class method,
that looks like:

verbatim
  public static Complex add (Complex a, Complex b) 
    return new Complex (a.real + b.real, a.imag + b.imag);
  
verbatim

To invoke this method, we would pass both operands as arguments:

verbatim
    Complex sum = add (x, y);
verbatim

Written as an object method, it would take only one argument,
which it would add to the current object:

verbatim
  public Complex add (Complex b) 
    return new Complex (real + b.real, imag + b.imag);
  
verbatim

Again, we can refer to the instance variables of the current
object implicitly, but to refer to the instance variables of
b we have to name b explicitly using dot notation.
To invoke this method, you invoke it on one of the operands
and pass the other as an argument.

 dot notation

verbatim
    Complex sum = x.add (y);
verbatim

From these examples you can see that the current object (this)
can take the place of one of the parameters.  For this reason,
the current object is sometimes called an implicit parameter.

A modifier
 modifier
 method!modifier

As yet another example, we'll look at conjugate, which is
a modifier method that transforms a Complex number into
its complex conjugate.  The complex conjugate of  is
.

As a class method, this looks like:

verbatim
  public static void conjugate (Complex c) 
    c.imag = -c.imag;
  
verbatim

As an object method, it looks like

verbatim
  public void conjugate () 
    imag = -imag;
  
verbatim

By now you should be getting the sense that converting a method
from one kind to another is a mechanical process.  With a little
practice, you will be able to do it without giving it much
thought, which is good because you should not be constrained to
writing one kind of method or the other.  You should be equally
familiar with both so that you can choose whichever one seems
most appropriate for the operation you are writing.

For example, I think that add should be written as a class
method because it is a symmetric operation of two operands, and
it makes sense for both operands to appear as parameters.  It just
seems odd to invoke the method on one of the operands and pass
the other as an argument.

On the other hand, simple operations that apply to a single object
can be written most concisely as object methods (even if they
take some additional arguments).

===The toString method===
 toString
 method!toString

There are two object methods that are common to many object
types: toString and equals.  toString converts
the object to some reasonable string representation that can
be printed.  equals is used to compare objects.

When you print an object using print or println,
Java checks to see whether you have provided an object method
named toString, and if so it invokes it.  If not, it
invokes a default version of toString that produces
the output described in Section printobject.

Here is what toString might look like for the Complex
class:

verbatim
  public String toString () 
    return real + &quot; + &quot; + imag + &quot;i&quot;;
  
verbatim

The return type for toString is String, naturally,
and it takes no parameters.  You can invoke toString in
the usual way:

verbatim
    Complex x = new Complex (1.0, 2.0);
    String s = x.toString ();
verbatim

or you can invoke it indirectly through print:

verbatim
    System.out.println (x);
verbatim

Whenever you pass an object to print or println, Java
invokes the toString method on that object and prints the result.
In this case, the output is 1.0 + 2.0i.

This version of toString does not look good if the imaginary
part is negative.  As an exercise, fix it.

===The equals method===
 equals
 method!equals

When you use the == operator to compare two objects,
what you are really asking is, ``Are these two things the same
object?''  That is, do both objects refer to the same location
in memory.

For many types, that is not the appropriate definition of
equality.  For example, two complex numbers are equal if their
real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.

 type!object

When you create a new object type, you can provide your own
definition of equality by providing an object method called
equals.  For the Complex class, this looks like:

verbatim
  public boolean equals (Complex b) 
    return (real == b.real &amp;&amp; imag == b.imag);
  
verbatim

By convention, equals is always an object method.  The return
type has to be boolean.

The documentation of equals in the Object class
provides some guidelines you should keep in mind when you
make up your own definition of equality:

quote

The equals method implements an equivalence relation: 

 equality
 identity

itemize

It is reflexive: for any reference value x, 
x.equals(x) should return true.

It is symmetric: for any reference values x and y,
x.equals(y) should return true if and only if 
y.equals(x) returns true.

It is transitive: for any reference values x, y, and
z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z)
returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.

It is consistent: for any reference values x and y,
multiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or
consistently return false.

For any reference value x, x.equals(null) should
return false.

itemize

quote

The definition of equals I provided satisfies all these
conditions except one.  Which one?  As an exercise, fix it.

Invoking one object method from another
 method!invoking

As you might expect, it is legal and common to invoke
one object method from another.  For example, to normalize a
complex number, you divide through (both parts) by the absolute
value.  It may not be obvious why this is useful, but it is.

Let's write the method normalize as an object method, and
let's make it a modifier.

verbatim
  public void normalize () 
    double d = this.abs();
    real = real/d;
    imag = imag/d;
  
verbatim

The first line finds the absolute value of the current object
by invoking abs on the current object.  In this case
I named the current object explicitly, but I could have left
it out.  If you invoke one object method within another, Java
assumes that you are invoking it on the current object.

As an exercise, rewrite normalize as a pure function. 
Then rewrite it as a class method.

===Oddities and errors===
 method!object
 method!class
 overloading

If you have both object methods and class methods in the same class
definition, it is easy to get confused.  A common way to organize a
class definition is to put all the constructors at the beginning,
followed by all the object methods and then all the class methods.

You can have an object method and a class method with the same
name, as long as they do not have the same number and types of
parameters.  As with other kinds of overloading, Java decides
which version to invoke by looking at the arguments you provide.

 static

Now that we know what the keyword static means, you
have probably figured out that main is a class method,
which means that there is no ``current object'' when it is invoked.

 current object
 this
 instance variable
 variable!instance

Since there is no current object in a class method, it is an
error to use the keyword this.  If you try, you might get
an error message like: ``Undefined variable: this.''  Also, you
cannot refer to instance variables without using dot notation
and providing an object name.  If you try, you might get 
``Can't make a static reference to nonstatic variable...''
This is not one of the better error messages, since it uses
some non-standard language.  For example, by ``nonstatic
variable'' it means ``instance variable.''  But once you know
what it means, you know what it means.

===Inheritance===
 inheritance

The language feature that is most often associated with
object-oriented programming is inheritance.  Inheritance is the
ability to define a new class that is a modified version of a
previously-defined class (including built-in classes).

The primary advantage of this feature is that you can add new methods
or instance variables to an existing class without modifying the
existing class.  This is particularly useful for built-in classes,
since you can't modify them even if you want to.

The reason inheritance is called ``inheritance'' is that the
new class inherits all the instance variables and methods
of the existing class.  Extending this metaphor, the existing
class is sometimes called the parent class.

===Drawable rectangles===
 Rectangle
 class!Rectangle
 drawable

An an example of inheritance, we are going to take the existing
Rectangle class and make it ``drawable.''  That is, we are going to
create a new class called DrawableRectangle that will have all
the instance variables and methods of a Rectangle, plus an
additional method called draw that will take a Graphics
object as a parameter and draw the rectangle.

The class definition looks like this:

verbatim
import java.awt.*;

class DrawableRectangle extends Rectangle 

  public void draw (Graphics g) 
    g.drawRect (x, y, width, height);
  

verbatim

Yes, that's really all there is in the whole class definition.  The
first line imports the java.awt package, which is where 
Rectangle and Graphics are defined.

 AWT
 import
 statement!import

The next line indicates that DrawableRectangle inherits from
Rectangle.  The keyword extends is used to identify the
parent class.

The rest is the definition of the draw method, which refers to
the instance variables x, y, width and height.
It might seem odd to refer to instance variables that don't appear in
this class definition, but remember that they are inherited from the
parent class.

To create and draw a DrawableRectangle, you could use
the following:

verbatim
  public static void draw
	       (Graphics g, int x, int y, int width, int height) 
    DrawableRectangle dr = new DrawableRectangle ();
    dr.x = 10;  dr.y = 10;
    dr.width = 200;  dr.height = 200;
    dr.draw (g);
  
verbatim

The parameters of draw are a Graphics object and
the bounding box of the drawing area (not the coordinates of the
rectangle).

It might seem odd to use the new command for a class
that has no constructors.  DrawableRectangle
inherits the default constructor of its parent class, so there
is no problem there.

 constructor

We can set the instance variables of dr and invoke methods
on it in the usual way.  When we invoke draw, Java invokes
the method we defined in DrawableRectangle.  If we invoked
grow or some other Rectangle method on dr, Java
would know to use the method defined in the parent class.

===The class hierarchy===
 class hierarchy
 Object
 parent class
 class!parent

In Java, all classes extend some other class.  The most basic class is
called Object.  It contains no instance variables, but it does
provide the methods equals and toString, among others.

Many classes extend Object, including almost all of the classes
we have written and many of the built-in classes, like 
Rectangle.  Any class that does not explicitly name a parent inherits
from Object by default.

Some inheritance chains are longer, though.  For example, Slate
extends Frame (see Appendix slate), which
extends Window, which extends Container, which extends
Component, which extends Object.  No matter how long the
chain, Object is the ultimate parent of all classes.

All the classes in Java can be organized into a ``family tree'' that
is called the class hierarchy.  Object usually appears at the
top, with all the ``child'' classes below.  If you look at the
documentation of Frame, for example, you will see the part of
the hierarchy that makes up Frame's pedigree.

===Object-oriented design===
 object-oriented design

Inheritance is a powerful feature.  Some programs that would be
complicated without inheritance can be written concisely and simply
with it.  Also, inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can
customize the behavior of build-in classes without having to modify
them.

On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read,
since it is sometimes not clear, when a method is invoked, where to
find the definition.  For example, one of the methods you can invoke
on a Slate is getBounds.  Can you find the documentation
for getBounds?  It turns out that getBounds is defined in
the parent of the parent of the parent of the parent of Slate.

Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can
be done almost as elegantly (or more so) without it.

description

[object method:]  A method that is invoked on an object,
and that operates on that object, which is referred to by
the keyword this in Java or ``the current object'' in
English.  Object methods do not have the keyword static.

[class method:]  A method with the keyword static.
Class methods are not invoked on objects and they do not have
a current object.

[current object:]  The object on which an object method
is invoked.  Inside the method,
the current object is referred to by this.

[this:]  The keyword that refers to the current object.

[implicit:]  Anything that is left unsaid or implied.  Within
an object method, you can refer to the instance variables
implicitly (without naming the object).

[explicit:]  Anything that is spelled out completely.  Within
a class method, all references to the instance variables have to
be explicit.

===References in objects===
 reference
 embedded reference
 reference!embedded
 node
 cargo

In the last chapter we saw that the instance variables of an
object can be arrays, and I mentioned that they can be objects,
too.

One of the more interesting possibilities is that an object
can contain a reference to another object of the same type.
There is a common data structure, the list, that takes advantage
of this feature.

Lists are made up of nodes, where each node contains a
reference to the next node in the list.  In addition, each node
usually contains a unit of data called the cargo.  In our
first example, the cargo will be a single integer, but later we
will write a generic list that can contain objects
of any type.

 generic data structure
 data structure!generic

===The Node class===
 Node class
 class!Node

As usual when we write a new class, we'll start with the instance
variables, one or two constructors and toString so that we
can test the basic mechanism of creating and displaying the new
type.

verbatim
public class Node 
    int cargo;
    Node next;

    public Node () 
        cargo = 0;
        next = null;
    

    public Node (int cargo, Node next) 
        this.cargo = cargo;
        this.next = next;
    

    public String toString () 
        return cargo + &quot;&quot;;
    

verbatim

The declarations of the instance variables follow naturally
from the specification, and the rest follows mechanically from
the instance variables.  The expression cargo + &quot;&quot; is
an awkward but concise way to convert an integer to a String.

To test the implementation so far, we would put something like
this in main:

verbatim
    Node node = new Node (1, null);
    System.out.println (node);
verbatim

The result is simply

verbatim
1
verbatim

To make it interesting, we need a list with more than
one node!

verbatim
    Node node1 = new Node (1, null);
    Node node2 = new Node (2, null);
    Node node3 = new Node (3, null);
verbatim

This code creates three nodes, but we don't have a list yet
because the nodes are not linked.  The state diagram
looks like this:


figure=figs/list1.eps


To link up the nodes, we have to make the first node refer to the
second and the second node refer to the third.

verbatim
    node1.next = node2;
    node2.next = node3;
    node3.next = null;
verbatim

The reference of the third node is null, which indicates that
it is the end of the list.  Now the state diagram looks like:


figure=figs/list2.eps


Now we know how to create nodes and link them into lists.  What
might be less clear at this point is why.

===Lists as collections===
 collection

The thing that makes lists useful is that they are a way of assembling
multiple objects into a single entity, sometimes called a collection.
In the example, the first node of the list serves as a reference to
the entire list.

 list!printing
 list!as parameter

If we want to pass the list as a parameter, all we have to pass is a
reference to the first node.  For example, the method printList
takes a single node as an argument.  Starting with the head of the
list, it prints each node until it gets to the end (indicated by the
null reference).

verbatim
    public static void printList (Node list) 
        Node node = list;

        while (node != null) 
            System.out.print (node);
            node = node.next;
        
        System.out.println ();
    
verbatim

To invoke this method we just have to pass a reference to the
first node:

verbatim
        printList (node1);
verbatim

Inside printList we have a reference to the first node
of the list, but there is no variable that refers to the other
nodes.  We have to use the next value from each node
to get to the next node.

This diagram shows the value of list and the values that
node takes on:


figure=figs/list3.eps


This way of moving through a list is called a traversal,
just like the similar pattern of moving through the elements of
an array.  It is common to use a loop variable like node
to refer to each of the nodes in the list in succession.

 loop variable
 list!traversal
 traverse

The output of this method is

verbatim
123
verbatim

By convention, lists are printed in parentheses with commas
between the elements, as in (1, 2, 3).  As an exercise, modify
printList so that it generates output in this format.

As another exercise, rewrite printList using a for loop
instead of a while loop.

===Lists and recursion===
 list!traverse recursively
 traverse

Recursion and lists go together like fava beans and a nice
Chianti.  For example, here is a recursive algorithm for printing
a list backwards:

 fava beans
 Chianti

enumerate

Separate the list into two pieces: the first node (called
the head) and the rest (called the tail).

Print the tail backwards.

Print the head.

enumerate

Of course, Step 2, the recursive call, assumes that we have a way of
printing a list backwards.  But if we assume that the recursive
call works---the leap of faith---then we can convince ourselves that
this algorithm works.

 leap of faith
 list!printing backwards

All we need is a base case, and a way of proving that for
any list we will eventually get to the base case.  A natural
choice for the base case is a list with a single element, but
an even better choice is the empty list, represented by null.

verbatim
    public static void printBackward (Node list) 
        if (list == null) return;

        Node head = list;
        Node tail = list.next;

        printBackward (tail);
        System.out.print (head);
        
verbatim

The first line handles the base case by doing nothing.  The
next two lines split the list into head and tail.
The last two lines print the list.

We invoke this method exactly as we invoked printList:

verbatim
        printBackward (node1);
verbatim

The result is a backwards list.

Can we prove that this method will always terminate?   In other
words, will it always reach the base case?  In fact, the answer
is no.  There are some lists that will make this method crash.


===Infinite lists===
 infinite list
 list!infinite
 loop!in list
 list!loop

There is nothing to prevent a node from referring back to
an earlier node in the list, including itself.  For example,
this figure shows a list with two nodes, one of which refers
to itself.


figure=figs/list4.eps


If we invoke printList on this list, it will loop forever.
If we invoke printBackward it will recurse infinitely.
This sort of behavior makes infinite lists difficult to work
with.

Nevertheless, they are occasionally useful.  For example, we
might represent a number as a list of digits and use an infinite
list to represent a repeating fraction.

Regardless, it is problematic that we cannot prove that printList
and printBackward terminate.  The best we can do is the
hypothetical statement, ``If the list contains no loops, then these
methods will terminate.''  This sort of claim is called a 
precondition.  It imposes a constraint on one of the parameters and
describes the behavior of the method if the constraint is satisfied.
We will see more examples soon.

 precondition

===The fundamental ambiguity theorem===
 ambiguity!fundamental theorem
 theorem!fundamental ambiguity

There is a part of printBackward that might have raised
an eyebrow:

verbatim
        Node head = list;
        Node tail = list.next;
verbatim

After the first assignment, head and list have the same
type and the same value.  So why did I create a new variable?

The reason is that the two variables play different roles.  We think
of head as a reference to a single node, and we think of
list as a reference to the first node of a list.  These
``roles'' are not part of the program; they are in the mind of the
programmer.

 variable!roles
 role!variable

The second assignment creates a new reference to the second node
in the list, but in this case we think of it as a list.
So, even though head and tail have the same
type, they play different roles.

This ambiguity is useful, but it can make programs with lists
difficult to read.  I often use variable names like node
and list to document how I intend to use a variable, and
sometimes I create additional variables to disambiguate.

I could have written printBackward without head
and tail, but I think it makes it harder to understand:

verbatim
    public static void printBackward (Node list) 
        if (list == null) return;

        printBackward (list.next);
        System.out.print (list);
        

verbatim

Looking at the two function calls, we have to remember that
printBackward treats its argument as a list and print
treats its argument as a single object.

Always keep in mind the fundamental ambiguity theorem:

quote
A variable that refers to a node
might treat the node as a single object or as the first
in a list of nodes.
quote

===Object methods for nodes===
 method!object
 node!object method

You might have wondered why printList and printBackward
are class methods.  I have made the claim that anything that can
be done with class methods can also be done with object methods;
it's just a question of which form is cleaner.

In this case there is a legitimate reason to choose
class methods.  It is legal to send null
as an argument to a class method, but it is not legal to invoke
an object method on a null object.

verbatim
	Node node = null;
	printList (node);       // legal
	node.printList ();      // NullPointerException
verbatim

This limitation makes it awkward to write list-manipulating
code in a clean, object-oriented style.  A little later we
will see a way to get around this, though.


===Modifying lists===
 list!modifying
 modifying lists

Obviously one way to modify a list is to change the cargo of
one of the nodes, but the more interesting operations are the
ones that add, remove, or reorder the nodes.

As an example, we'll write a method that removes the second
node in the list and returns a reference to the removed node.

verbatim
    public static Node removeSecond (Node list) 
        Node first = list;
        Node second = list.next;

        // make the first node refer to the third
        first.next = second.next;

        // separate the second node from the rest of the list
        second.next = null;
        return second;
    
verbatim

Again, I am using temporary variables to make the code more
readable.  Here is how to use this method.

verbatim
        printList (node1);
        Node removed = removeSecond (node1);
        printList (removed);
        printList (node1);
verbatim

The output is

verbatim
(1, 2, 3)           the original list
(2)                 the removed node
(1, 3)              the modified list
verbatim

Here is a state diagram showing the effect of this operation.


figure=figs/list5.eps


What happens if we invoke this method and pass a list with only one
element (a singleton)?  What happens if we pass the empty list
as an argument?  Is there a precondition for this method?

 singleton


===Wrappers and helpers===
 wrapper methods
 method!wrapper
 helper method
 method!helper

For some list operations it is useful to divide the labor into
two methods.  For example, to print a list backwards in the
conventional list format, (3, 2, 1) we can use the
printBackwards method to print 3, 2, but we need
a separate method to print the parentheses and the first node.
We'll call it printBackwardNicely.

verbatim
    public static void printBackwardNicely (Node list) 
        System.out.print (&quot;(&quot;);

        if (list != null) 
            Node head = list;
            Node tail = list.next;
            printBackward (tail);
            System.out.print (head);
        
        System.out.println (&quot;)&quot;);
    	
verbatim

Again, it is a good idea to check methods like this to see
if they work with special cases like an empty list or
a singleton.

 singleton

Elsewhere in the program, when we use this method, we will
invoke printBackwardNicely directly and it will invoke
printBackward on our behalf.  In that sense, 
printBackwardNicely acts as a wrapper, and it uses
printBackward as a helper.

===The LinkedList class===
 LinkedList
 class!LinkedList

There are a number of subtle problems with the way we have been
implementing lists.  In a reversal of cause and effect, I will
propose an alternative implementation first and then explain what
problems it solves.

First, we will create a new class called LinkedList.  Its
instance variables are an integer that contains the length of the list
and a reference to the first node in the list.  LinkedList objects
serve as handles for manipulating lists of Node objects.

verbatim
public class LinkedList 
    int length;
    Node head;

    public LinkedList () 
        length = 0;
        head = null;
    

verbatim

One nice thing about the LinkedList class is that it gives
us a natural place to put wrapper functions like
printBackwardNicely, which we can make an object
method in the LinkedList class.

verbatim
    public void printBackward () 
        System.out.print (&quot;(&quot;);

        if (head != null) 
            Node tail = head.next;
            Node.printBackward (tail);
            System.out.print (head);
        
        System.out.println (&quot;)&quot;);
    	
verbatim

Just to make things confusing, I renamed printBackwardNicely.
Now there are two methods named printBackward: one in the
Node class (the helper) and one in the LinkedList class
(the wrapper).  In order for the wrapper to invoke the helper, it has
to identify the class explicitly (Node.printBackward).

So, one of the benefits of the LinkedList class is that
it provides a nice place to put wrapper functions.
Another is that it makes it easier to add or remove
the first element of a list.  For example, addFirst
is an object method for LinkedLists; it
takes an int as an argument and puts it at the beginning of
the list.

verbatim
    public void addFirst (int i) 
        Node node = new Node (i, head);
        head = node;
        length++;
    
verbatim

As always, to check code like this it is a good idea to think about
the special cases.  For example, what happens if the list is initially
empty?


===Invariants===
 invariant
 object invariant
 list!well-formed

Some lists are ``well-formed;'' others are not.  For example, if
a list contains a loop, it will cause many of our methods to
crash, so we might want to require that lists contain no loops.
Another requirement is that the length value in the LinkedList
object should be equal to the actual number of nodes in the list.

Requirements like this are called invariants because, ideally,
they should be true of every object all the time.  Specifying invariants
for objects is a useful programming practice because it makes it
easier to prove the correctness of code, check the integrity of
data structures, and detect errors.

One thing that is sometimes confusing about invariants is that
there are some times when they are violated.  For example, in the
middle of addFirst, after we have added the node, but
before we have incremented length, the invariant is
violated.  This kind of violation is acceptable; in fact, it is
often impossible to modify an object without violating an
invariant for at least a little while.  Normally the requirement
is that every method that violates an invariant must restore
the invariant.

If there is any significant stretch of code in which the invariant
is violated, it is important for the comments to make that clear,
so that no operations are performed that depend on the invariant.

===Abstract data types===
 abstract data typeseeADT
 ADT
 encapsulation

The data types we have looked at so far are all concrete, in the
sense that we have completely specified how they are implemented.
For example, the Card class represents a card using two
integers.  As I discussed at the time, that is not the only way
to represent a card; there are many alternative implementations.

An abstract data type, or ADT, specifies a set of operations (or
methods) and the semantics of the operations (what they do) but it
does not specify the implementation of the operations.  That's
what makes it abstract.

===Why is that useful?===

itemize

It simplifies the task of specifying an algorithm if you
can denote the operations you need without having to think at the
same time about how the operations are performed.

Since there are usually many ways to implement an ADT,
it might be useful to write an algorithm that can be used with
any of the possible implementations.

Well-known ADTs, like the Stack ADT in this chapter,
are often implemented in standard libraries so they can be written
once and used by many programmers.

The operations on ADTs provide a common high-level language
for specifying and talking about algorithms.

itemize

When we talk about ADTs, we often distinguish the code that uses
the ADT, called the client code, from the code that implements
the ADT, called provider code because it provides a standard
set of services.

 client
 provider


===The Stack ADT===
 stack
 collection
 ADT!Stack

In this chapter we will look at one common ADT, the stack.  A
stack is a collection, meaning that it is a data structure that
contains multiple elements.  Other collections we have seen include
arrays and lists.

As I said, an ADT is defined by a set of operations.
Stacks can perform the following set of operations:

description

[constructor:] Create a new, empty stack.

[push:] Add a new item to the stack.

[pop:] Remove and return an item from the stack.  The item
that is returned is always the last one that was added.

[empty:] Check whether the stack is empty.

description

A stack is sometimes called a ``last in, first out,'' or LIFO
data structure, because the last item added is the first to
be removed.

===The Java Stack Object===
 Stack
 class!Stack
 generic data structure
 data structure!generic

Java provides a built-in object type called Stack that
implements the Stack ADT.  You should make some effort to keep
these two things---the ADT and the Java implementation---straight.
Before using the Stack class, we have to import it from
java.util.

Then the syntax for constructing a new Stack is

verbatim
    Stack stack = new Stack ();
verbatim

Initially the stack is empty, as we can confirm with the
empty method, which returns a boolean:

verbatim
    System.out.println (stack.empty ());
verbatim

A stack is a generic data structure, which means that we can
add any type of item to it.  In the Java implementation, though,
we can only add object types.  For our first example, we'll
use Node objects, as defined in the previous chapter.
Let's start by creating and printing a short list.

verbatim
    LinkedList list = new LinkedList ();
    list.addFirst (3);
    list.addFirst (2);
    list.addFirst (1);
    list.print ();
verbatim

The output is (1, 2, 3).  To put a Node object onto
the stack, use the push method:

verbatim
	stack.push (list.head);
verbatim

The following loop traverses the list and pushes all the nodes
onto the stack:

verbatim
    for (Node node = list.head; node != null; node = node.next) 
        stack.push (node);
    
verbatim

We can remove an element from the stack with the pop method.

verbatim
    Object obj = stack.pop ();
verbatim

The return type from pop is Object!  That's because the
stack implementation doesn't really know the type of the objects it
contains.  When we pushed the Node objects, they were automatically
converted to Objects.  When we get them back from the stack,
we have to cast them back to Nodes.

verbatim
Node node = (Node) obj;
System.out.println (node);
verbatim

Unfortunately, the burden falls on the programmer to keep track of the
objects in the stack and cast them back to the right type when they
are removed.  If you try to cast an object to the wrong type, you get
a ClassCastException.

The following loop is a common idiom for popping all the elements
from a stack, stopping when it is empty:

verbatim
    while (!stack.empty ()) 
        Node node = (Node) stack.pop ();
        System.out.print (node + &quot; &quot;);
    

verbatim

The output is 3 2 1.  In other words, we just used a stack
to print the elements of a list backwards!  Granted, it's not the
standard format for printing a list, but using a stack it was
remarkably easy to do.

You should compare this code to the implementations of 
printBackward in the previous chapter.  There is a natural parallel
between the recursive version of printBackward and the stack
algorithm here.  The difference is that printBackward uses the
run-time stack to keep track of the nodes while it traverses the list,
and then prints them on the way back from the recursion.  The stack
algorithm does the same thing, just using a Stack object instead
of the run-time stack.


===Wrapper classes===
 wrapper class
 class!wrapper
 object type
 primitive type
 

For every primitive type in Java, there is a built-in object type
called a wrapper class.  For example, the wrapper class for
int is called Integer; for double it is called
Double.

Wrapper classes are useful for several reasons:

itemize

You can instantiate wrapper classes and create objects
that contain primitive values.  In other words, you can wrap
a primitive value up in an object, which is useful if you want
to invoke a method that requires an object type.

Each wrapper class contains special values (like the
minimum and maximum values for the type), and methods that are useful
for converting between types.

itemize


===Creating wrapper objects===
 wrapper class!instantiating

The most straightforward way to create a wrapper object is
to use its constructor:

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (17);
    Double d = new Double (3.14159);
    Character c = new Character ('b');
verbatim

Technically String is not a wrapper class, because there
is no corresponding primitive type, but the syntax for creating
a String object is the same:

verbatim
    String s = new String (&quot;fred&quot;);
verbatim

On the other hand, no one ever uses the constructor for
String objects, because you can get the same effect
with a simple String value:

verbatim
    String s = &quot;fred&quot;;
verbatim


===Creating more wrapper objects===

Some of the wrapper classes have a second constructor that takes
a String as an argument and tries to convert
to the appropriate type.  For example:

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (&quot;17&quot;);
    Double d = new Double (&quot;3.14159&quot;);
verbatim

The type conversion process is not very robust.
For example, if the Strings are not in the right format,
they will cause a NumberFormatException.  Any non-numeric
character in the String, including a space, will cause
the conversion to fail.

 NumberFormatException
 exception!NumberFormat

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (&quot;17.1&quot;);        // WRONG!!
    Double d = new Double (&quot;3.1459 &quot;);       // WRONG!!
verbatim

It is usually a good idea to check the format of the String
before you try to convert it.


===Getting the values out===
 wrapper class!extracting value

Java knows how to print wrapper objects, so the easiest
way to extract a value is just to print the object:

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (17);
    Double d = new Double (3.14159);
    System.out.println (i);
    System.out.println (d);
verbatim

Alternatively, you can use the toString method to
convert the contents of the wrapper object to a String

verbatim
    String istring = i.toString();
    String dstring = d.toString();
verbatim

Finally, if you just want to extract the primitive value
from the object, there is an object method in each wrapper
class that does the job:

verbatim
    int iprim = i.intValue ();
    double dprim = d.doubleValue ();
verbatim

There are also methods for converting wrapper objects into
different primitive types.  You should check out the documentation
for each wrapper class to see what is available.


===Useful methods in the wrapper classes===
 wrapper class!methods

As I mentioned, the wrapper classes contain useful methods that
pertain to each type.  For example, the Character class contains
lots of methods for converting characters to upper and lower case, and
for checking whether a character is a number, letter, or symbol.

The String class also contains methods for converting to upper
and lower case.  Keep in mind, though, that they are functions,
not modifiers (see Section immutable).

As another example, the Integer class contains methods for
interpreting and printing integers in different bases.  If you have a
String that contains a number in base 6, you can convert to base
10 using parseInt.

verbatim
    String base6 = &quot;12345&quot;;
    int base10 = Integer.parseInt (base6, 6);
    System.out.println (base10);
verbatim

Since parseInt is a class method, you invoke it by
naming the class and the method in dot notation.

Base 6 might not be all that useful, but hexadecimal
(base 16) and octal (base 8) are common for computer science
related things.


===Postfix expressions===
 postfix
 infix
 expressions

In most programming languages, mathematical expressions are
written with the operator between the two operands, as in
1+2.  This format is called infix.  An alternate
format used by some calculators is called postfix.  In
postfix, the operator follows the operands, as in 1 2+.

The reason postfix is sometimes useful is that there is a
natural way to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack.

itemize

Starting at the beginning of the expression, get one
term (operator or operand) at a time.

	itemize

	If the term is an operand, push it on the stack.

	If the term is an operator, pop two operands off
	the stack, perform the operation on them, and push the
	result back on the stack.

	itemize

When we get to the end of the expression, there should
be exactly one operand left on the stack.  That operand is the
result.

itemize

As an exercise, apply this algorithm to the expression
1 2 + 3 *.

This example demonstrates one of the advantages of postfix: there is
no need to use parentheses to control the order of operations.  To get
the same result in infix, we would have to write (1 + 2) * 3.
As an exercise, write a postfix expression that is equivalent to 
1 + 2 * 3?


===Parsing===
 parse
 token
 delimiter
 class!StringTokenizer
 StringTokenizer class

In order to implement the algorithm from the previous section,
we need to be able to traverse a string and break it into operands
and operators.  This process is an example of parsing, and
the results---the individual chunks of the string---are called
tokens.

Java provides a built-in class called a StringTokenizer
that parses strings and breaks them into tokens.  To use it, you
have to import it from java.util.

In its simplest form, the StringTokenizer uses spaces
to mark the boundaries between tokens.  A character that marks
a boundary is called a delimiter.

We can create a StringTokenizer in the usual way, passing
as an argument the string we want to parse.

verbatim
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer (&quot;Here are four tokens.&quot;);
verbatim

The following loop is a standard idiom for extracting the tokens
from a StringTokenizer.

verbatim
    while (st.hasMoreTokens ()) 
        System.out.println (st.nextToken());
    
verbatim

The output is

verbatim
Here
are
four
tokens.
verbatim

For parsing expressions, we have the option of specifying additional
characters that will be used as delimiters:

verbatim
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer (&quot;11 22+33*&quot;, &quot; +-*/&quot;);
verbatim

The second argument is a String that contains all the characters
that will be used as delimiters.  Now the output is:

verbatim
11
22
33
verbatim

This succeeds at extracting all the operands but we have lost the
operators.  Fortunately, there is one more option for 
StringTokenizers.

verbatim
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer (&quot;11 22+33*&quot;, &quot; +-*/&quot;, true);
verbatim

The third argument says, ``Yes, we would like to treat the delimiters
as tokens.''  Now the output is

verbatim
11
 
22
+
33
*
verbatim

This is just the stream of tokens we would like for evaluating
this expression.


===Implementing ADTs===
 encapsulation
 ADT

One of the fundamental goals of an ADT is to separate the
interests of the provider, who writes the code that implements
the ADT, and the client, who uses the ADT.
The provider only has to worry
about whether the implementation is correct---in accord
with the specification of the ADT---and not how it will be used.

Conversely, the client assumes that the implementation of the
ADT is correct and doesn't worry about the details.  When you
are using one of Java's built-in classes, you have the luxury
of thinking exclusively as a client.

When you implement an ADT, on the other hand, you also have
to write client code to test it.  In that case, you sometimes
have to think carefully about which role you are playing at
a given instant.

In the next few sections we will switch gears and look at one way of
implementing the Stack ADT, using an array.  Start thinking like a
provider.


===Array implementation of the Stack ADT===
arraystack
 implementation!Stack
 stack!array implementation

The instance variables for this implementation are
an array of Objects, which will contain the items on
the stack, and an integer index which will keep track of
the next available space in the array.
Initially, the array is empty and the index is 0.

To add an element to the stack (push), we'll copy 
a reference to it onto the stack and increment the index.
To remove an element (pop) we have to decrement the
index first and then copy the element out.

Here is the class definition:

verbatim
public class Stack 
    Object[] array;
    int index;

    public Stack () 
        this.array = new Object[128];
        this.index = 0;
    

verbatim

As usual, once we have chosen the instance variables, it is
a mechanical process to write a constructor.
For now, the default size is 128 items.  Later we will consider
better ways of handling this.

Checking for an empty stack is trivial.

verbatim
    public boolean empty () 
        return index == 0;
    
verbatim

It is important to remember, though, that the number of elements in
the stack is not the same as the size of the array.  Initially the
size is 128, but the number of elements is 0.

The implementations of push and pop follow naturally from
the specification.

verbatim
    public void push (Object item) 
        array[index] = item;
        index++;
    

    public Object pop () 
        index--;
        return array[index];
    
verbatim

To test these methods, we can take advantage of the client code
we used to exercise the built-in Stack.  All we have to do is
comment out the line import java.util.Stack.  Then, instead
of using the stack implementation from java.util the
program will use the implementation we just wrote.

If everything goes according to plan, the program should
work without any additional changes.  Again, one of the strengths
of using an ADT is that you can change implementations without
changing client code.


===Resizing arrays===
resize
 array!resizing
 ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
 exception!ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

A weakness of this implementation is that it chooses
an arbitrary size for the array when the Stack is created.  If
the user pushes more than 128 items onto the stack, it will cause
an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception.

 ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
 exception!ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

An alternative is to let the client code specify the size of
the array.  This alleviates the problem, but it requires the client
to know ahead of time how many items are needed, and that is not
always possible.

A better solution is to check whether the array is full and make
it bigger when necessary.  Since we have no idea how big the
array needs to be, it is a reasonable strategy to start with a
small size and double it each time it overflows.

Here's the improved version of push:

verbatim
    public void push (Object item) 
        if (full ()) resize ();

        // at this point we can prove that index &lt; array.length

        array[index] = item;
        index++;
    
verbatim

Before putting the new item in the array, we check if the array
is full.  If so, we invoke resize.  After the if statement,
we know that either (1) there was room in the array, or (2) the
array has been resized and there is room.  If full and
resize are
correct, then we can prove that index &lt; array.length, and 
therefore the next statement cannot cause an exception.

Now all we have to do is implement full and resize.

verbatim
    private boolean full () 
        return index == array.length;
    

    private void resize () 
        Object[] newArray = new Object[array.length * 2];

        // we assume that the old array is full
        for (int i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++) 
            newArray[i] = array[i];
        
        array = newArray;
    
verbatim

Both methods are declared private, which means that they
cannot be invoked from another class, only from
within this one.  This is acceptable, since there is no reason
for client code to use these functions, and desirable, since
it enforces the boundary between the implementation and the
client.

 method!private
 private method

The implementation of full is trivial; it just checks
whether the index has gone beyond the range of valid indices.

The implementation of resize is straightforward, with
the caveat that it assumes that the old array is full.  In other
words, that assumption is a precondition of this method.  It is
easy to see that this precondition is satisfied, since the only
way resize is invoked is if full returns true,
which can only happen if index == array.length.

At the end of resize, we replace the old array with
the new one (causing the old to be garbage collected).  The
new array.length is twice as big as the old, and 
index hasn't changed, so now it must be true that
index &lt; array.length.  This assertion is a postcondition
of resize: something that must be true when the method
is complete (as long as its preconditions were satisfied).

Preconditions, postconditions, and invariants are useful tools
for analyzing programs and demonstrating their correctness.
In this example I have demonstrated a programming style that
facilitates program analysis and a style of documentation that
helps demonstrate correctness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Queues and Priority Queues==

This chapter presents two ADTs: Queues and Priority Queues.
In real life a queue is a line of customers waiting for service
of some kind.  In most cases, the first customer in line is the
next customer to be served.  There are exceptions, though.  For
example, at airports customers whose flight is leaving imminently
are sometimes taken from the middle of the queue.  Also, at
supermarkets a polite customer might let someone with only a
few items go first.

The rule that determines who goes next is called a 
queueing discipline.  The simplest queueing discipline is
called FIFO, for ``first-in-first-out.''  The most general
queueing discipline is priority queueing, in which each customer
is assigned a priority, and the customer with the highest priority
goes first, regardless of the order of arrival.  The reason I
say this is the most general discipline is that the priority
can be based on anything: what time a flight leaves, how many
groceries the customer has, or how important the customer is.
Of course, not all queueing disciplines are ``fair,'' but
fairness is in the eye of the beholder.

The Queue ADT and the Priority Queue ADT have the same set
of operations and their interfaces are the same.  The difference
is in the semantics of the operations: a Queue uses the FIFO
policy, and a Priority Queue (as the name suggests) uses the
priority queueing policy.

As with most ADTs, there are a number of ways to implement queues.
Since a queue is a collection of items, we can use any of the basic
mechanisms for storing collections, including arrays and lists.
Our choice among them will be based in part on their performance---
how long it takes to perform the operations we want to perform---
and partly on ease of implementation.

===The queue ADT===
 ADT!Queue
 Queue ADT
 implementation!Queue
 queue!List implementation

The queue ADT is defined by the following operations:

description

[constructor:] Create a new, empty queue.

[insert:] Add a new item to the queue.

[remove:] Remove and return an item from the queue.  The item
that is returned is the first one that was added.

[empty:] Check whether the queue is empty.

description

To demonstrate a queue implementation, I will take advantage of the
LinkedList class from Chapter list.  Also, I will assume that
we have a class named Customer that defines all the information
about each customer, and the operations we can perform on customers.

As far as our implementation goes, it does not matter what kind of
object is in the Queue, so we can make it generic.  Here is
what the implementation looks like.

verbatim
public class Queue 
    public LinkedList list;

    public Queue () 
        list = new List ();
    

    public boolean empty () 
        return list.empty ();
    

    public void insert (Object obj) 
        list.addLast (obj);
    

    public Object remove () 
        return list.removeFirst ();
    

verbatim

A queue object contains a single instance variable, which is
the list that implements it.  For each of the other methods,
all we have to do is invoke one of the methods from the
LinkedList class.


===Veneer===
 veneer
 performance hazard
 performance analysis

An implementation like this is called a veneer.  In
real life, veneer is a thin coating of good quality wood used
in furniture-making to hide lower quality wood underneath.
Computer scientists use this metaphor to describe a small
piece of code that hides the details of an implementation and
provides a simpler, or more standard, interface.

This example demonstrates one of the nice things about a
veneer, which is that it is easy to implement, and one of
the dangers of using a veneer, which is the performance
hazard!

Normally when we invoke a method we are not concerned with the
details of its implementation.  But there is one ``detail''
we might want to know---the performance characteristics of the
method.  How long does it take, as a function of the number
of items in the list?

First let's look at removeFirst.

verbatim
    public Object removeFirst () 
        Object result = head;
        if (head != null) 
            head = head.next;
        
        return result;
    
verbatim

There are no loops or function calls here, so that suggests that
the run time of this method is the same every time.  Such a method
is called a constant time operation.
In reality, the method might be slightly faster
when the list is empty, since it skips the body of the conditional,
but that difference is not significant.

 constant time

The performance of addLast is very different.

verbatim
    public void addLast (Object obj) 
        // special case: empty list
        if (head == null) 
            head = new Node (obj, null);
            return;
        
        Node last;
        for (last = head; last.next != null; last = last.next) 
            // traverse the list to find the last node
        
        last.next = new Node (obj, null);
    
verbatim

The first conditional handles the special case of adding a new node to
an empty list.  In this case, again, the run time does not depend on
the length of the list.  In the general case, though, we have to
traverse the list to find the last element so we can make it refer to
the new node.

This traversal takes time proportional to the length of the
list.  Since the run time is a linear function of the length,
we would say that this method is linear time.  Compared to
constant time, that's very bad. 

 linear time


===Linked Queue===
 queue!linked implementation
 linked queue

We would like an implementation of the Queue ADT that can
perform all operations in constant time.  One way to
accomplish that is to implement a linked queue, which
is similar to a linked list in the sense that it is made up
of zero or more linked Node objects.  The difference
is that the queue
maintains a reference to both the first and the last node,
as shown in the figure.


figure=figs/queue1.eps,width=4in


Here's what a linked Queue implementation looks like:

verbatim
public class Queue 
    public Node first, last;

    public Queue () 
        first = null;
        last = null;
    

    public boolean empty () 
        return first == null;
    

verbatim

So far it is straightforward.  In an empty queue, both first
and last are null.  To check whether a list is empty, we only
have to check one of them.

insert is a little more complicated because we have to
deal with several special cases.

verbatim
    public void insert (Object obj) 
        Node node = new Node (obj, null);
        if (last != null) 
            last.next = node;
        
        last = node;
        if (first == null) 
            first = last;
        
    
verbatim

The first condition checks to make sure that last refers
to a node; if it does then we have to make it refer to the new
node.

The second condition deals with the special case where the list
was initially empty.  In this case both first and last
refer to the new node.

remove also deals with several special cases.

verbatim
    public Object remove () 
        Node result = first;
        if (first != null) 
            first = first.next;
        
        if (first == null) 
            last = null;
        
        return result;
    
verbatim

The first condition checks whether there were any nodes in
the queue.  If so, we have to copy the next node into
first.  The second condition deals with the special
case that the list is now empty, in which case we have to
make last null.

As an exercise, draw diagrams showing both operations in
both the normal case and in the special cases, and convince
yourself that they are correct.

Clearly, this implementation is more complicated than the
veneer implementation, and it is more difficult to demonstrate
that it is correct.  The advantage is that we have achieved
the goal: both insert and remove are constant
time.


===Circular buffer===
 queue!circular buffer implementation
 circular buffer
 buffer!circular

Another common implementation of a queue is a circular
buffer.  ``Buffer'' is a general name for a temporary storage
location, although it often refers to an array, as it does in
this case.  What it means to say a buffer is ``circular'' should
become clear in a minute.

The implementation of a circular buffer is similar to the array
implementation of a stack, as in Section arraystack.  The
queue items are stored in an array, and we use indices to
keep track of where we are in the array.  In the stack implementation,
there was a single index that pointed to the next available space.
In the queue implementation, there are two indices: first
points to the space in the array that contains the first customer
in line and next points to the next available space.

The following figure shows a queue with two items (represented
by dots).


figure=figs/queue2.eps,width=4in


There are two ways to think of the variables first and
last.  Literally, they are integers, and their values are
shown in boxes on the right.  Abstractly, though, they are
indices of the array, and so they are often drawn as arrows
pointing to locations in the array.  The arrow representation is
convenient, but you should remember that the indices are not
references; they are just integers.

Here is an incomplete array implementation of a queue:

verbatim
public class Queue 
    public Object[] array;
    public int first, next;

    public Queue () 
        array = new Object[128];
        first = 0;
        next = 0;
    

    public boolean empty () 
        return first == next;
    
verbatim

The instance variables and the constructor are straightforward,
although again we have the problem that we have to choose an
arbitrary size for the array.  Later we will solve that problem,
as we did with the stack, by resizing the array if it gets full.

The implementation of empty is a little surprising.  You might
have thought that first == 0 would indicate an empty queue, but
that neglects the fact that the head of the queue is not necessarily
at the beginning of the array.  Instead, we know that the queue is
empty if head equals next, in which case there are no
items left.  Once we see the implementation of insert and 
remove, that situation will make more sense.

verbatim
    public void insert (Object item) 
        array[next] = item;
        next++;
    

    public Object remove () 
        Object result = array[first];
        first++;
        return result;
    
verbatim

insert looks very much like push in Section arraystack;
it puts the new item in the next available space and then increments
the index.

remove is similar.  It takes the first item from the queue
and then increments first so it refers to the new head of the queue.
The following figure shows what the queue looks like after both
items have been removed.


figure=figs/queue3.eps,width=4in


It is always true that next points to an available space.
If first catches up with next and points to the same
space, then first is referring to an ``empty'' location,
and the queue is empty.  I put ``empty'' in quotation marks because
it is possible that the location that first points to actually
contains a value (we do nothing to ensure that empty locations contain
null); on the other hand, since we know the queue is empty, we
will never read this location, so we can think of it, abstractly,
as empty.

As an exercise, fix remove so that it returns null
if the queue is empty.

The next problem with this implementation is that eventually it
will run out of space.  When we add an item we increment next
and when we remove an item we increment first, but we never
decrement either.  What happens when we get to the end of the
array?

The following figure shows the queue after we add four more items:


figure=figs/queue4.eps,width=4in


The array is now full.  There is no ``next available space,'' so there
is nowhere for next to point.  One possibility is that we could
resize the array, as we did with the stack implementation.  But in that
case the array would keep getting bigger regardless of how many items
were actually in queue.  A better solution is to wrap around to the
beginning of the array and reuse the spaces there.  This ``wrap around''
is the reason this implementation is called a circular buffer.

One way to wrap the index around is to add a special case whenever
we increment an index:

verbatim
        next++;
        if (next == array.length) next = 0; 
verbatim

A fancy alternative is to use the modulus operator:

verbatim
        next = (next + 1) 
verbatim

Either way, we have one last problem to solve.  How do we know
if the queue is really full, meaning that we cannot insert
another item?  The following figure shows what the queue looks
like when it is ``full.''


figure=figs/queue5.eps,width=4in


There is still one empty space in the array, but the queue is
full because if we insert another item, then we have to increment
next such that next == first, and in that case it
would appear that the queue was empty!

To avoid that, we sacrifice one space in the array.  So how
can we tell if the queue is full?

verbatim
        if ((next + 1) 
verbatim

And what should we do if the array is full?  In that case resizing
the array is probably the only option.

As an exercise, put together all the code from this section and
write an implementation of a queue using a circular buffer that
resizes itself when necessary.


===Priority queue===
 priority queue!ADT
 ADT!Priority Queue

The Priority Queue ADT has the same interface as
the Queue ADT, but different semantics.  The interface is:

description

[constructor:] Create a new, empty queue.

[insert:] Add a new item to the queue.

[remove:] Remove and return an item from the queue.  The item
that is returned is the one with the highest priority.

[empty:] Check whether the queue is empty.

description

The semantic difference is that the item that is removed from
the queue is not necessarily the first one that was added.  Rather,
it is whatever item in the queue has the highest priority.
What the priorities are, and how they compare to each other, are not
specified by the Priority Queue implementation.  It depends on
what the items are that are in the queue.

For example, if the items in the queue have names, we might choose
them in alphabetical order.  If they are bowling scores, we might
choose from highest to lowest, but if they are golf scores, we would
go from lowest to highest.

 generic
 data structure!generic

So we face a new problem.  We would like an implementation of
Priority Queue that is generic---it should work with any kind
of object---but at the same time the code that implements Priority
Queue needs to have the ability to compare the objects it contains.

We have seen a way to implement generic data structures using
Objects, but that does not solve this problem, because
there is no way to compare Objects unless we know what type
they are.

The answer lies in a new Java feature called an abstract class.


===Abstract class===
 abstract class
 class!abstract
 Comparable
 abstract class!Comparable

An abstract class is a set of classes.  The abstract class definition
specifies the requirements a class must satisfy to be a member.

Often abstract classes have names that end in ``able'' to indicate
the fundamental capability the abstract class requires.  For
example, any class that provides a method named draw can
be a member of the abstract class named Drawable.  Any
class that contains a method named start can be a member
of the abstract class Runnable.

As of Java 2, Java provides a built-in abstract class that we
can use in an implementation of a Priority Queue.  It is called
Comparable, and it means what it says.  Any class that
belongs to the Comparable abstract class has to provide
a method named compareTo that compares two objects and
returns a value indicating whether one is larger or smaller than
the other, or whether they are the same.

Many of the built-in Java classes are members of the Comparable
abstract class, including numeric wrapper classes like Integer
and Double.

In the next section I will show how to write an ADT that manipulates
an abstract class.  Then we will see how to write a new (concrete)
class that belongs to an existing abstract class.  Then we will see
how to write a new abstract class.


===Array implementation of Priority Queue===
 implementation!Priority Queue
 priority queue!array implementation

In the implementation of the Priority Queue, every time we specify
the type of the items in the queue, we specify the abstract class
Comparable.  For example, the instance variables are an
array of Comparables and an integer:

verbatim
public class PriorityQueue 
    private Comparable[] array;
    private int index;

verbatim

As usual, index is the index of the next available location in the
array.  The instance variables are declared private so that
other classes cannot have direct access to them.

The constructor and empty are similar to what we have seen
before.  I chose the initial size for the array arbitrarily.

verbatim
    public PriorityQueue () 
        array = new Comparable [16];
        index = 0;
    

    public boolean empty () 
        return index == 0;
    
verbatim

insert is similar to push:

verbatim
    public void insert (Comparable item) 
        if (index == array.length) 
            resize ();
        
        array[index] = item;
        index++;
    
verbatim

I omitted the implementation of resize.
The only substantial method in the class is remove, which has
to traverse the array to find and remove the largest item:

verbatim
    public Comparable remove () 
        if (index == 0) return null;

        int maxIndex = 0;

        // find the index of the item with the highest priority
        for (int i=1; i&lt;index; i++) 
            if (array[i].compareTo (array[maxIndex]) &gt; 0) 
                maxIndex = i;
            
        
        Comparable result = array[maxIndex];

        // move the last item into the empty slot
        index--;
        array[maxIndex] = array[index];
        return result;
   
verbatim

As we traverse the array, maxIndex keeps track of the
index of the largest element we have seen so far.  What it
means to be the ``largest'' is determined by compareTo.
In this case the compareTo method is provided by the
Integer class, and it does what we expect---larger
(more positive) numbers win.


===A Priority Queue client===
 client
 abstract class
 class!abstract

The implementation of Priority Queue is written entirely
in terms of Comparable objects, but there is no
such thing as a Comparable object!  Go ahead, try
to create one:

verbatim
    Comparable comp = new Comparable ();       // ERROR
verbatim

You'll get a compile-time message that says something like
``java.lang.Comparable is an interface.  It can't be instantiated.''
In Java, abstract classes are called interfaces.  I have
avoided this word so far because it also means several other
things, but now you have to know.

 interface

Why can't abstract classes be instantiated?  Because an abstract
class only specifies requirements (you must have a compareTo
method); it does not provide an implementation.

To create a Comparable object, you have to create one of the
objects that belongs to the Comparable set, like Integer.
Then you can use that object anywhere a Comparable is called
for.

verbatim
        PriorityQueue pq = new PriorityQueue ();
        Integer item = new Integer (17);
        pq.insert (item);
verbatim

This code creates a new, empty Priority Queue and a new Integer
object.  Then it inserts the Integer into the queue.  
insert is expecting a Comparable as a parameter, so it is
perfectly happy to take an Integer.  If we try to pass a 
Rectangle, which does not belong to Comparable, we get a
compile-time message like, ``Incompatible type for method.  Explicit
cast needed to convert java.awt.Rectangle to java.lang.Comparable.''

That's the compiler telling us that if we want to make that conversion,
we have to do it explicitly.  We might try to do what it says:

verbatim
	Rectangle rect = new Rectangle ();
	pq.insert ((Comparable) rect);
verbatim

But in that case we get a run-time error, a ClassCastException.
When the Rectangle tries to pass as a Comparable, the
run-time system checks whether it satisfies the requirements, and
rejects it.  So that's what we get for following the compiler's advise.

 ClassCastException
 exception!ClassCastException

To get items out of the queue, we have to reverse the process:

verbatim
    while (!pq.empty ()) 
        item = (Integer) pq.remove ();
        System.out.println (item);
    
verbatim

This loop removes all the items from the queue and prints them.
It assumes that the items in the queue are Integers.
If they were not, we would get a ClassCastException.


===The Golfer class===
 Golfer
 class!Golfer
 abstract class!implementing
 Comparable

Finally, let's look at how we can make a new class that belongs to
Comparable.  As an example of something with an unusual definition
of ``highest'' priority, we'll use golfers:

verbatim
public class Golfer implements Comparable 
    String name;
    int score;

    public Golfer (String name, int score) 
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    

verbatim

The class definition and the constructor are pretty much the same as
always; the difference is that we have to declare that Golfer
implements Comparable.  In this case the keyword implements
means that Golfer implements the interface specified by 
Comparable.

If we try to compile Golfer.java at
this point, we get something like ``class Golfer must be declared
abstract. It does not define int compareTo(java.lang.Object) from
interface java.lang.Comparable.''  In other words, to be a Comparable,
Golfer has to provide a method named compareTo.  So
let's write one:

verbatim
    public int compareTo (Object obj) 
        Golfer that = (Golfer) obj;

        int a = this.score;
        int b = that.score;
	
        // for golfers, low is good!
        if (a &lt; b) return 1;
        if (a &gt; b) return -1;
        return 0;
    
verbatim

Two things here are a little surprising.  First, the parameter
is an Object.  That's because in general the caller doesn't
know what type the objects are that are being compared.  For
example, in PriorityQueue.java when we invoke compareTo,
we pass a Comparable as a parameter.  We don't have to
know whether it is an Integer or a Golfer or whatever.

Inside compareTo we have to convert the parameter from
an Object to a Golfer.  As usual, there is a risk
when we do this kind of cast: if we cast to the wrong type we
get an exception.

Finally, we can create some golfers:

verbatim
        Golfer tiger = new Golfer (&quot;Tiger Woods&quot;, 61);
        Golfer phil = new Golfer (&quot;Phil Mickelson&quot;, 72);
        Golfer hal = new Golfer (&quot;Hal Sutton&quot;, 69);
verbatim

And put them in the queue:

verbatim
        pq.insert (tiger);
        pq.insert (phil);
        pq.insert (hal);
verbatim

When we pull them out:

verbatim
        while (!pq.empty ()) 
            golfer = (Golfer) pq.remove ();
            System.out.println (golfer);
        
verbatim

They appear in descending order (for golfers):

verbatim
        Tiger Woods     61
        Hal Sutton      69
        Phil Mickelson  72
verbatim

When we switched from Integers to Golfers, we didn't
have to make any changes in PriorityQueue.java at all.  So
we succeeded in maintaining a barrier between PriorityQueue
and the classes that use it, allowing us to reuse the code without
modification.  Furthermore, we were able to give the client code
control over the definition of compareTo, making this
implementation of PriorityQueue more versatile.

 tree
 ADT
 data structure

This chapter presents a new data structure called a tree, some of its
uses and two ways to implement it.

A possible source of confusion is the distinction
between an ADT, a data structure, and an implementation of an ADT or
data structure.  There is no universal answer, because something
that is an ADT at one level might in turn be the implementation of
another ADT.

 diagram!implementation

To help keep some of this straight, it is sometimes useful to draw
a diagram showing the relationship between an ADT and its possible
implementations.  This figure shows that there are two implementations
of a tree:


figure=figs/tree_adt.eps


The horizontal line in the figure represents the barrier of
abstraction between the ADT and its implementations.


===A tree node===
 node
 tree node
 cargo
 embedded reference
 implementation!Tree
 binary tree

Like lists, trees are made up of nodes.  A common kind of tree is
a binary tree, in which each node contains a reference to two
other nodes (possibly null).  The class definition looks like this:

verbatim
public class Tree 
    Object cargo;
    Tree left, right;

verbatim

Like list nodes, tree nodes contain cargo: in this case a generic 
Object.  The other instance variables are named left and 
right, in accordance with a standard way to represent trees
graphically:


figure=figs/tree1.eps


The top of the tree (the node referred to by tree) is
called the root.  In keeping with the tree
metaphor, the other nodes are called branches and the nodes
at the tips with null references are called leaves.  It
may seem odd that we draw the picture with the root at the top
and the leaves at the bottom, but that is not the strangest thing.

 root node
 leaf node
 parent node
 child node
 level

To make things worse, computer scientists mix in yet another
metaphor: the family tree.  The top node is sometimes called
a parent and the nodes it refers to are its children.
Nodes with the same parent are called siblings, and so on.

Finally, there is also a geometric vocabulary for taking
about trees.  I already mentioned left and right, but there is
also ``up'' (toward the parent/root) and down (toward the
children/leaves).  Also, all the nodes that are the same
distance from the root comprise a level of the tree.

I don't know why we need three metaphors for talking about trees,
but there it is.

===Building trees===
 tree!linked implementation

The process of assembling tree nodes is similar
to the process of assembling lists.
We have a constructor for tree nodes that initializes the instance
variables.

verbatim
    public Tree (Object cargo, Tree left, Tree right) 
        this.cargo = cargo;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    
verbatim

We allocate the child nodes first:

verbatim
    Tree left = new Tree (new Integer(2), null, null);
    Tree right = new Tree (new Integer(3), null, null);
verbatim

We can create the parent node and link it to the children
at the same time:

verbatim
    Tree tree = new Tree (new Integer(1), left, right);
verbatim

This code produces the state shown in the previous figure.


===Traversing trees===
 tree!traversal
 traverse

The most natural
way to traverse a tree is recursively.  For example, to
add up all the integers in a tree, we could write this class
method:

verbatim
    public static int total (Tree tree) 
        if (tree == null) return 0;
        Integer cargo = (Integer) tree.cargo;
        return cargo.intValue() + total (tree.left) + total (tree.right);
    
verbatim

This is a class method because we would like to use null to
represent the empty tree, and make the empty tree the base case of the
recursion.  If the tree is empty, the method returns 0.
Otherwise it makes two recursive calls to find the total value of its
two children.  Finally, it adds in its own cargo and returns the
total.

 tree!empty

Although this method works, there is some difficulty fitting it into
an object-oriented design.
It should not appear in the Tree class because it
requires the cargo to be Integer objects.  If we make that
assumption in Tree.java then we lose the advantages of a generic
data structure.

On the other hand, this code accesses the instance variables
of the Tree nodes, so it ``knows'' more than it should about
the implementation of the tree.  If we changed that implementation
later (and we will) this code would break.

Later in this chapter we will develop ways to solve this problem,
allowing client code to traverse trees containing any kinds of objects
without breaking the abstraction barrier between the client code and
the implementation.  Before we get there, let's look at an
application of trees.


===Expression trees===
 tree!expression
 expression tree
 postfix
 infix

A tree is a natural way to represent the structure of an expression.
Unlike other notations, it can represent the comptation unambiguously.
For example, the infix expression 1 + 2 * 3 is ambiguous unless
we know that the multiplication happens before the addition.

The following figure represents the same computation:


figure=figs/tree2.eps


The nodes can be operands like 1 and 2 or operators
like + and *.  Operands are leaf nodes; operator nodes 
contain references to their operands (all of these operators
are binary, meaning they have exactly two operands).

Looking at this figure, there is no question what the order of
operations is: the multiplication happens first in order to compute
the first operand of the addition.

Expression trees like this have many uses.  The example we are
going to look at is translation from one format (postfix) to
another (infix).  Similar trees are used inside compilers to parse,
optimize and translate programs.


===Traversal===
 tree!traversal
 traverse
 recursion
 preorder
 postorder
 inorder

I already pointed out that recursion provides a natural way to
traverse a tree.  We can print the contents of an expression tree
like this:

verbatim
    public static void print (Tree tree) 
        if (tree == null) return;
        System.out.print (tree + &quot; &quot;);
        print (tree.left);
        print (tree.right);
    
verbatim

In other words, to print a tree, first print the contents of
the root, then print the entire left subtree, then print the
entire right subtree.  This way of traversing a tree is called
a preorder, because the contents of the root appear before
the contents of the children.

For the example expression the output is + 1 * 2 3.  This
is different from both postfix and infix; it is a new notation called
prefix, in which the operators appear before their operands.

You might suspect that if we traverse the tree in a
different order we get the expression in a different
notation.  For example, if we print the subtrees first, and then
the root node:

verbatim
    public static void printPostorder (Tree tree) 
        if (tree == null) return;
        printPostorder (tree.left);
        printPostorder (tree.right);
        System.out.print (tree + &quot; &quot;);
    
verbatim

We get the expression in postfix (1 2 3 * +)!  As the
name of the previous method implies, this order of traversal
is called postorder.  Finally, to traverse a tree inorder,
we print the left tree, then the root, then the right tree:

verbatim
    public static void printInorder (Tree tree) 
        if (tree == null) return;
        printInorder (tree.left);
        System.out.print (tree + &quot; &quot;);
        printInorder (tree.right);
    
verbatim

The result is 1 + 2 * 3, which is the expression in infix.

To be fair, I have to point out that I omitted an
important complication.  Sometimes when we write an expression
in infix we have to use parentheses to preserve the order of
operations.  So an inorder traversal is not quite sufficient to
generate an infix expression.

Nevertheless, with a few improvements, the expression tree 
and the three recursive traversals provide 
a general way to translate expressions from one format to
another.


===Encapsulation===
 encapsulation
 client
 provider
 abstract class
 class!abstract

As I mentioned before, there is a problem with the way we have been
traversing trees: it breaks down the barrier between the client code
(the application that uses the tree) and the provider code (the Tree
implementation).  Ideally, tree code should be general; it shouldn't
know anything about expression trees.  And the code that generates and
traverses the expression tree shouldn't know about the implementation
of the trees.  This design criterion is called object
encapsulation to distinguish it from the encapsulation we saw in
Section encapsulation, which we might call method
encapsulation.

In the current version, the Tree code knows too much about
the client.  Instead, the Tree class should provide
the general capability of traversing a tree in various ways.  As
it traverses, it should perform operations on each node that are
specified by the client.


 Visitable
 abstract class!Visitable

To facilitate this separation of interests, we will
create a new abstract class, called Visitable.  The items
stored in a tree will be required to be visitable, which means
that they define a method named visit that does whatever
the client wants done to each node.  That way the
Tree can perform the traversal and the client can perform
the node operations.

Here are the steps we have to perform to wedge an abstract class
between a client and a provider:

enumerate

Define an abstract class that specifies the methods
the provider code will need to invoke on its components.

Write the provider code in terms of the new abstract class,
as opposed to generic Objects.

Define a concrete class that belongs to the abstract class
and that implements the required methods 
as appropriate for the client.

Write the client code to use the new concrete class.

enumerate

The next few sections demonstrate these steps.


===Defining an abstract class===
 abstract class!defining
 interface

An abstract class definition looks a lot like a concrete class
definition, except that it only specifies the interface of each
method and not an implementation.  The definition of Visitable
is

verbatim
public interface Visitable 
    public void visit ();

verbatim

That's it!  The word interface is Java's keyword for an
abstract class.  The definition of visit looks like any other
method definition, except that it has no body.  This definition
specifies that any class that implements Visitable has to have
a method named visit that takes no parameters and that returns
void.

 body!method

Like other class definitions, abstract class definitions go in a file
with the same name as the class (in this case Visitable.java).


===Implementing an abstract class===
 abstract class!implementing
 Token class
 class!Token

If we are using an expression tree to generate infix, then
``visiting'' a node means printing its contents.  Since the
contents of an expression tree are tokens, we'll create a new concrete
class called Token that implements Visitable

verbatim
public class Token implements Visitable 
    String str;

    public Token (String str) 
        this.str = str;
    

    public void visit () 
        System.out.print (str + &quot; &quot;);
    

verbatim

When we compile this class definition (which is in a file named 
Token.java), the compiler checks whether the methods provided satisfy
the requirements specified by the abstract class.  If not, it will
produce an error message.  For example, if we misspell the name of the
method that is supposed to be visit, we might get
something like, ``class Token must be declared abstract. It does not
define void visit() from interface Visitable.''

The next step is to modify the parser to put Token objects
into the tree instead of Strings.  Here is a small example:

verbatim
    String expr = &quot;1 2 3 * +&quot;;
    StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer (expr, &quot; +-*/&quot;, true);
    String token = st.nextToken();
    Tree tree = new Tree (new Token (token), null, null));
verbatim

This code takes the first token in the string and wraps it in
a Token object, then puts the Token into a tree node.
If the Tree requires the cargo to be Visitable, it
will convert the Token to be a Visitable object.
When we remove the Visitable from the tree, we will have
to cast it back into a Token.

As an exercise, write a version of printPreorder called
visitPreorder that traverses the tree and invokes
visit on each node in preorder.


===Array implementation of trees===
 tree!array implementation
 implementation!Tree
 ADT!Tree

What does it mean to ``implement'' a tree?  So far we have only seen
one implementation of a tree, a linked data structure similar to a
linked list.  But there are other structures we would like to identify
as trees.  Anything that can perform the basic set of tree operations
should be recognized as a tree.

So what are the tree operations?  In other words, how do we define
the Tree ADT?

description

[constructor:]  Build an empty tree.

[isEmpty:]  Is this tree the empty tree?

[getLeft:]  Return the left child of this node.

[getRight:]  Return the left child of this node.

[getParent:]  Return the parent of this node.

[getCargo:]  Return the cargo object from this node.

[setCargo:]  Assign a cargo object to this node
(and create the node, if necessary).

description

In the implementation we have seen, the empty tree is represented
by the special value null.  getLeft and getRight are
performed by accessing the instance variables of the node, as are
getCargo and setCargo.  We
have not implemented getParent yet (you might think about how
to do it).

There is another implementation of trees that uses arrays and
indices instead of objects and references.  To see how it works,
we will start by looking at a hybrid implementation that uses
both arrays and objects.

This figure shows a tree like the ones we have been looking at,
although it is laid out sideways, with the root at the left and
the leaves on the right.  At the bottom there is an array of
references that refer to the objects in the trees.
The cargo objects are represented as null references.


figure=figs/tree3.eps,width=5in


You might notice that array index 1 refers to the
root node and array index 0 is empty.  The reason for
that will become clear soon.

So now we have a tree where each node has a unique index.
Furthermore, the indices have been assigned to the nodes according
to a deliberate pattern, in order to achieve the following
results:

enumerate

The left child of the node with index  has index .

The right child of the node with index  has index .

The parent of the node with index  has index  (rounded down).

enumerate

Using these formulas, we can implement getLeft, getRight
and getParent just by doing arithmetic; we don't have to
use the references at all!

Since we don't use the references, we can get rid of them,
which means that what used to be a tree node is now just cargo
and nothing else.  That means we can implement the tree as an
array of cargo objects; we don't need tree nodes at all.

Here's what one implementation looks like:

verbatim
public class Tree 
    Object[] array;
    int i;

    public Tree () 
        array = new Object [128];
        i = 1;
    

    public Tree (Object[] array, int i) 
        this.array = array;
        this.i = i;
    
verbatim

No surprises so far.  The instance variables are
an array of Objects and an integer that indicates where in
the array the new node is found.

The first constructor initializes the array
with an arbitrary initial size (we can always resize it later).
The second constructor assumes that the array of objects already
exists.  All nodes that comprise a tree will share the
same array and have different values of i.

We use i to access the cargo of a given node:

verbatim
    public Object getCargo () 
        if (i &gt;= array.length) return null;
        return array[i];
    

    public void setCargo (Object obj) 
        if (i &gt;= array.length) 
            array = resize (array);
        
        array[i] = obj;
    
verbatim

Both methods have to check the length of the array.  If getCargo
tries to access a nonexistent element of the array, it returns null
to indicate an empty tree.  If getCargo goes past the length of
the array, it resizes the array to make room (see Section resize
for a possible implementation of resize).

To check whether a node is an empty tree, we check whether the cargo
is null.

verbatim
    public boolean empty () 
        return (getCargo() == null);
    
verbatim

The implementation of getLeft, getRight
and getParent is just arithmetic:

verbatim
    public Tree getLeft () 
        return new Tree (array, 2*i);
    

    public Tree getRight () 
        return new Tree (array, 2*i + 1);
    

    public Tree parent () 
        return new Tree (array, i/2);
    
verbatim

Finally we are ready to build a tree.  In another class (the client),
we would write

verbatim
    Tree tree = new Tree ();
    tree.setCargo (&quot;cargo for root&quot;);
verbatim

The constructor builds an empty tree.
Invoking setCargo puts the
string &quot;cargo for root&quot; into the root node.

To add children to the root node:

verbatim
    tree.getLeft().setCargo (&quot;cargo for left&quot;);
    tree.getRight().setCargo (&quot;cargo for right&quot;);
verbatim

In the tree class we could provide a method that prints
the contents of the tree in preorder.

verbatim
    public void print () 
        if (isEmpty ()) return;
        System.out.println (array[i]);
        getLeft().print();
        getRight().print();
    
verbatim

We invoke this method from the client by passing the root as
a parameter.

verbatim
    tree.print (root);
verbatim

The output is

verbatim
cargo for root
cargo for left
cargo for right
verbatim

This implementation provides the basic operations that define a
tree.  As I pointed out, the linked implementation of a tree provides
the same operations, but the syntax is different.  As an exercise,
modify the linked tree so that it implements the Tree ADT.

One problem with the array implementation
is that the initial size of the array is arbitrary and it might have
to be resized.  This last problem can be solved by replacing the
array with a Vector.


===The Vector class===
vector
 Vector class
 class!Vector

The Vector is a built-in Java class in the java.util
package.  It is an implementation of an array of Objects,
with the added feature that it can resize itself automatically,
so we don't have to.

The Vector class provides methods named get and
set that are similar to the getCargo and setCargo
methods we wrote for the Tree class.
You should review the other Vector operations by consulting
the online documentation.

Before using the Vector class, you should understand
a few concepts.  Every Vector has a
capacity, which is the amount of space that has been allocated
to store values, and a size, which is the number of values that
are actually in the vector.

The following figure is a simple diagram of a Vector
that contains three elements, but it has a capacity of seven.


figure=figs/vector.eps


In general, it is the responsibility of the client code to make
sure that the vector has sufficient size before invoking
set or get.  If you try to access an element that does
not exist (in this case the elements with indices 3 through 6),
you will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception.

 exception!ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
 ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

The Vector methods
add and insert automatically increase the
size of the Vector, but set does not.  The resize
method adds null elements to the end of the Vector
to get to the given size.

Most of the time the client doesn't have to worry about
capacity.  Whenever the size of the Vector changes,
the capacity is updated automatically.
For performance reasons, some applications might want to take
control of this function, which is why there are additional methods
for increasing and decreasing capacity.

Because the client code has no access to the implementation of
a vector, it is not clear how we should traverse one.  Of course,
one possibility is to use a loop variable as an index into the
vector:

verbatim
        for (int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) 
            System.out.println (v.get(i));
        
verbatim

There's nothing wrong with that, but there is another way that
serves to demonstrate the Iterator class.  Vectors provide
a method named iterator that returns an Iterator object
that makes it possible to traverse the vector.


===The Iterator class===
iterator
 Iterator class
 class!Iterator
 abstract class

Iterator is an abstract class in the java.util
package.  It specifies three methods:

description

[hasNext:] Does this iteration have more elements?

[next:] Return the next element, or throw an exception if
there is none.

[remove:] Remove from the collection the last
element that was returned.

description

The following example uses an iterator to traverse and print the
elements of a vector.

verbatim
        Iterator iterator = vector.iterator ();
        while (iterator.hasNext ()) 
            System.out.println (iterator.next ());
        
verbatim

Once the Iterator is created, it is a separate object from
the original Vector.  Subsequent changes in the Vector
are not reflected in the Iterator.  In fact, if you
modify the Vector after creating an Iterator,
the Iterator becomes invalid.  If you access the
Iterator again, it will cause a ConcurrentModification
exception.

 exception!ConcurrentModification
 ConcurrentModification

In a previous section we used the Visitable abstract class to
allow a client to traverse a data structure without knowing the
details of its implementation.  Iterators provide another way to do
the same thing.  In the first case, the provider performs the iteration
and invokes client code to ``visit'' each element.  In the second
case the provider gives the client an object that it can use to
select elements one at a time (albeit in an order controlled by
the provider).

As an exercise, write a concrete class named PreIterator that
implements the Iterator interface, and write a method named 
preorderIterator for the Tree class that returns a 
PreIterator that selects the elements of the Tree in preorder.

===The Heap===
 Heap
 ADT
 diagram!implementation

A heap is a special kind of tree that happens to be an efficient
implementation of a priority queue.  This figure shows the relationships
among the data structures in this chapter.


figure=figs/heap_adt.eps


Ordinarily we try to maintain as much distance as possible
between an ADT and its implementation, but in the case of the 
Heap, this barrier breaks down a little.  The reason is that
we are interested in the performance of the operations we implement.
For each implementation
there are some operations that are easy to implement and efficient,
and others that are clumsy and slow.

It turns out that the array implementation of a tree works
particularly well as an implementation of a Heap.  The 
operations the array performs well are
exactly the operations we need to implement a Heap.

To understand this relationship, we will proceed in a few steps.
First, we need to develop ways of comparing the performance of
various implementations.  Next, we will look at the operations
Heaps perform.  Finally, we will compare the Heap implementation
of a Priority Queue to the others (arrays and lists) and see
why the Heap is considered particularly efficient.


===Performance analysis===
 performance analysis
 run time
 algorithm analysis

When we compare algorithms, we would like to have a way to tell
when one is faster than another, or takes less space, or uses less
of some other resource.  It is hard to answer those questions in
detail, because the time and space used by an algorithm depend on the
implementation of the algorithm, the particular problem being
solved, and the hardware the program runs on.

The objective of this section is to develop a way of talking about
performance that is independent of all of those things, and only
depends on the algorithm itself.  To start, we will focus on run
time; later we will talk about other resources.

Our decisions are guided by a series of constraints:

enumerate

First, the performance of an algorithm depends on the
hardware it runs on, so we usually don't talk about run time
in absolute terms like seconds.  Instead, we usually
count the number of abstract operations the algorithm performs.

Second, performance often depends on the particular
problem we are trying to solve -- some problems are easier than
others.  To compare algorithms, we usually focus on either the
worst-case scenario or an average (or common) case.

Third, performance depends on the size of the problem
(usually, but not always, the number of elements in a collection).
We address this dependence explicitly by
expressing run time as a function of problem size.

Finally, performance depends on
details of the implementation like object allocation overhead
and method invocation overhead.  We usually ignore these details
because they don't affect the rate at which the
number of abstract operations increases with problem size.

enumerate

To make this process more concrete, consider two algorithms we
have already seen for sorting an array of integers.  The
first is selection sort, which we saw in Section sorting.
Here is the pseudocode we used there.

verbatim
    selectionsort (array) 
        for (int i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++) 
          // find the lowest item at or to the right of i
          // swap the ith item and the lowest item
        
    
verbatim

To perform the
operations specified in the pseudocode, we wrote helper methods named
findLowest and swap.  In pseudocode,
findLowest looks like this

verbatim
    // find the index of the lowest item between
    // i and the end of the array

    findLowest (array, i) 
        // lowest contains the index of the lowest item so far
        lowest = i;
        for (int j=i+1; j&lt;array.length; j++) 
          // compare the jth item to the lowest item so far
          // if the jth item is lower, replace lowest with j
        
        return lowest;
    
verbatim

And swap looks like this:

verbatim
    swap (i, j) 
        // store a reference to the ith card in temp
        // make the ith element of the array refer to the jth card
        // make the jth element of the array refer to temp
    
verbatim

To analyze the performance of this algorithm, 
the first step is to decide what operations to count.  Obviously,
the program does a lot of things: it increments i, compares
it to the length of the deck, it searches for the largest element
of the array, etc.  It is not obvious what the right thing is
to count.

 sorting
 selection sort

It turns out that a good choice is the number of
times we compare two items.  Many other choices would yield
the same result in the end, but this is easy to do and we will
find that it allows us to compare most easily with other sort
algorithms.

The next step is to define the ``problem size.''  In this case
it is natural to choose the size of the array, which we'll call
.

Finally, we would like to derive an expression that tells us how
many abstract operations (specifically, comparisons) we have to
do, as a function of .

 helper method

We start by analyzing the helper methods.  swap copies
several references, but it doesn't perform any comparisons, so
we ignore the time spent performing swaps.
findLowest starts at i and traverses the array,
comparing each item to lowest.  The number of
items we look at is , so the total number of
comparisons is .

Next we consider how many times findLowest
gets invoked and what the value of  is each time.  The last
time it is invoked,  is  so the number of
comparisons is 1.  The previous iteration performs 2 comparisons,
and so on.  During the first iteration,  is  and the
number of comparisons is .

So the total number of comparisons is .
This sum is equal to .  To describe this algorithm,
we would typically ignore the lower order term () and say
that the total amount of work is proportional to .  Since
the leading order term is quadratic, we might also say that this
algorithm is quadratic time.

 quadratic time


===Analysis of mergesort===
 mergesort
 analysis!mergesort
 sorting
 algorithm analysis

In Section mergesort I claimed that mergesort takes time
that is proportional to , but I didn't explain how
or why.  Now I will.

Again, we start by looking at pseudocode for the algorithm.
For mergesort, it's

verbatim
  mergeSort (array) 
    // find the midpoint of the array
    // divide the array into two halves
    // sort the halves recursively
    // merge the two halves and return the result
  
verbatim

At each level of the recursion, we split the array in half,
make two recursive calls, and then merge the halves.  Graphically,
the process looks like this:


figure=figs/mergetree.eps,width=5in


Each line in the diagram is a level of the recursion.  At the
top, a single array divides into two halves.  At the bottom, 
arrays (with one element each) are merged into  arrays (with
2 elements each).

 recursion

The first two columns of the table show the number of arrays at each
level and the number of items in each array.  The third column shows
the number of merges that take place at each level of recursion.  The
next column is the one that takes the most thought: it shows the
number of comparisons each merge performs.

 pseudocode

If you look at the pseudocode (or your implementation) of
merge, you should convince yourself that in the worst case it
takes  comparisons, where  is the total number items
being merged.

The next step is to multiply the number of merges at each level
by the amount of work (comparisons) per merge.  The result is the
total work at each level.  At this point we take advantage of a small
trick.  We know that in the end we are only interested in the
leading-order term in the result, so we can go ahead
and ignore the  term in the comparisons per merge.  If we do
that, then the total work at each level is simply .

Next we need to know the number of levels as a function of .  Well,
we start with an array of  items and divide it in half until it
gets to 1.  That's the same as starting at 1 and multiplying by 2
until we get to .  In other words, we want to know how many times
we have to multiply 2 by itself before we get to .  The answer is
that the number of levels, , is the logarithm, base 2, of .

Finally, we multiply the amount of work per level, , by the
number of levels,  to get , as promised.
There isn't a good name for this functional form; most of the
time people just say, ``en log en.''

It might not be obvious at first that  is better than
, but for large values of , it is.
As an exercise, write a program that prints  and
 for a range of values of .


===Overhead===
 overhead

Performance analysis takes a lot of handwaving.  First we ignored most
of the operations the program performs and counted only comparisons.
Then we decided to consider only worst case performance.  During the
analysis we took the liberty of rounding a few things off, and when we
finished, we casually discarded the lower-order terms.

When we interpret the results of this analysis, we have to keep
all this hand-waving in mind.  Because mergesort is ,
we consider it a better algorithm than selection sort, but that
doesn't mean that mergesort is always faster.  It just means
that eventually, if we sort bigger and bigger arrays, mergesort
will win.

How long that takes depends on the details of the implementation,
including the additional work, besides the comparisons we counted,
that each algorithm performs.  This extra work is sometimes called
overhead.  It doesn't affect the performance analysis, but
it does affect the run time of the algorithm.

For example, our implementation of mergesort actually allocates
subarrays before making the recursive calls and then lets them get
garbage collected after they are merged.  Looking again at the diagram
of mergesort, we can see that the total amount of space that gets
allocated is proportional to , and the total number of
objects that get allocated is about .  All that allocating takes
time.

Even so, it is most often true that a bad implementation of a good
algorithm is better than a good implementation of a bad algorithm.
The reason is that for large values of  the good algorithm is
better and for small values of  it doesn't matter because both
algorithms are good enough.

As an exercise, write a program that prints values of
 and
 for a range of values of .  For what value of
 are they equal?


===Priority Queue implementations===
 implementation!Priority Queue
 analysis!Priority Queue
 priority queue!sorted list implementation

In Chapter queue we looked at an implementation of a Priority
Queue based on an array.  The items in the array are unsorted, so it
is easy to add a new item (at the end), but harder to remove an
item, because we have to search for the item with the highest
priority.

An alternative is an implementation based on a sorted list.
In this case when we insert a new item we traverse the list and
put the new item in the right spot.  This implementation takes
advantage of a property of lists, which is that it is easy to
insert a new node into the middle.  Similarly, removing the
item with the highest priority is easy, provided that we
keep it at the beginning of the list.

Performance analysis of these operations is straightforward.
Adding an item to the end of an array or
removing a node from the beginning of a list takes the same amount
of time regardless of the number of items.  So both operations
are constant time.

 constant time

Any time we traverse an array or list, performing a constant-time
operation on each element, the run time is
proportional to the number of items.  Thus, removing something
from the array and adding something to the list are both
linear time.

 linear time

So how long does it take to insert and then remove  items
from a Priority Queue?  For the array implementation, 
insertions takes time proportional to , but the removals
take longer.  The first removal has to traverse all  items;
the second has to traverse , and so on, until the last
removal, which only has to look at 1 item.  Thus, the total
time is , which is (still) .
So the total for the insertions and the removals is the
sum of a linear function and a quadratic function.  The
leading term of the result is quadratic.

The analysis of the list implementation is similar.  The
first insertion doesn't require any traversal, but after that
we have to traverse at least part of the list each time we
insert a new item.  In general we don't know how much of the
list we will have to traverse, since it depends on the data
and what order they are inserted, but we can assume that on
average we have to traverse half of the list.  Unfortunately,
even traversing half of the list is still a linear operation.

So, once again, to insert and remove  items takes time
proportional to .  Thus, based on this analysis we cannot
say which implementation is better; both the array and the
list yield quadratic run times.

If we implement a Priority Queue using a heap, we can
perform both insertions and removals in time proportional
to .  Thus the total time for  items is ,
which is better than .  That's why, at the beginning of
the chapter, I said that a heap is a particularly efficient
implementation of a Priority Queue.


===Definition of a Heap===
 Heap!definition
 tree
 complete tree
 tree!complete
 heap property

A heap is a special kind of tree.  It has two properties
that are not generally true for other trees:

description

[completeness:] The tree is complete, which means that
nodes are added from top to bottom, left to right, without
leaving any spaces.

[heapness:] The item in the tree with the highest priority
is at the top of the tree, and the same is true for every subtree.

description

Both of these properties call for a little explaining.
This figure shows a number of trees that are considered
complete or not complete:


figure=figs/tree4.eps,width=4in


An empty tree is also considered complete.  We can define completeness
more rigorously by comparing the height of the subtrees.  Recall that
the height of a tree is the number of levels.

 height

Starting at the root, if the tree is complete, then the
height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree
should be equal, or the left subtree may be taller by one.
In any other case, the tree cannot be complete.

Furthermore, if the tree is complete, then the height
relationship between the subtrees has to be true for every
node in the tree.

It is natural to write these rules as a recursive method:

verbatim
    public static boolean isComplete (Tree tree) 
        // the null tree is complete
        if (tree == null) return true;

        int leftHeight = height (tree.left);
        int rightHeight = height (tree.right);
        int diff = leftHeight - rightHeight;

        // check the root node
        if (diff &lt; 0  diff &gt; 1) return false;

        // check the children
        if (!isComplete (tree.left)) return false;
        return isComplete (tree.right);
    
verbatim

For this example I used the linked implementation of a tree.  As
an exercise, write the same method for the array implementation.
Also as an exercise, write the height method.  The height of
a null tree is 0 and the height of a leaf node is 1.

 recursive definition

The heap property is similarly recursive.  In order for a
tree to be a heap, the largest value in the tree has to be at
the root, and the same has to be true for each subtree.
As another exercise, write a method that checks whether a tree
has the heap property.


===Heap remove===
 reheapify

It might seem odd that we are going to remove things from the
heap before we insert any, but I think removal is easier
to explain.

At first glance, we might think that removing an item from the
heap is a constant time operation, since the item with
the highest priority is always at the root.  The problem is that
once we remove the root node, we are left with something that
is no longer a heap.  Before we can return the result, we have
to restore the heap property.  We call this operation
reheapify.

The situation is shown in the following figure:


figure=figs/tree5.eps,height=2in


The root node has priority r and two subtrees, A and B.
The value at the root of Subtree A is a and the value at
the root of Subtree B is b.

We assume that before we remove r from the tree, the
tree is a heap.  That implies that r is the largest value
in the heap and that a and b are the largest values
in their respective subtrees.

Once we remove r, we have to make the resulting tree
a heap again.  In other words we need to make sure it has
the properties of completeness and heapness.

The best way to ensure completeness is to remove the bottom-most,
right-most node, which we'll call c and put its value at the
root.  In a general tree implementation, we would have to traverse the
tree to find this node, but in the array implementation, we can find
it in constant time because it is always the last (non-null) element
of the array.

Of course, the chances are that the last value is not the highest,
so putting it at the root breaks the heapness property.  Fortunately
it is easy to restore.  We know that the largest value in the
heap is either a or b.  Therefore we can select whichever
is larger and swap it with the value at the root.

Arbitrarily, let's say that b is larger.  Since we
know it is the highest value left in the heap, we can put it
at the root and put c at the top of Subtree B.  Now the
situation looks like this:


figure=figs/tree6.eps,height=2in


Again, c is the value we copied from the
last entry in the array and b is the highest
value left in the heap.  Since we haven't changed Subtree A
at all, we know that it is still a heap.  The only problem is
that we don't know if Subtree B is a heap, since we just stuck
a (probably low) value at its root.

 recursion

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a method that could reheapify
Subtree B?  Wait... we do!


===Heap insert===

Inserting a new item in a heap is a similar operation, except that
instead of trickling a value down from the top, we trickle it
up from the bottom.

Again, to guarantee completeness, we add the new element at the
bottom-most, rightmost position in the tree, which is the next
available space in the array.

Then to restore the heap property, we compare the new value with
its neighbors.  The situation looks like this:


figure=figs/tree7.eps,height=2in


The new value is c.  We can restore the heap property
of this subtree by comparing c to a.  
If c is smaller, then the heap property is satisfied.
If c is larger, then we swap c and a.  The
swap satisfies the heap property because we know that c
must also be bigger than b, because c &gt; a and
a &gt; b.

Now that the subtree is reheapified, we can work our way up
the tree until we reach the root.


===Performance of heaps===
 Heap!analysis
 analysis!Heap

For both insert and remove, we perform a constant time operation
to do the actual insertion and removal, but then we have to
reheapify the tree.  In one case we start at the root and work
our way down, comparing items and then recursively reheapifying
one of the subtrees.  In the other case we start at a leaf and
work our way up, again comparing elements at each level of
the tree.

As usual, there are several operations we might want to count,
like comparisons and swaps.  Either choice would work; the
real issue is the number of levels of the tree we examine
and how much work we do at each level.  In both cases we
keep examining levels of the tree until we restore the heap
property, which means we might only visit one, or in the worst
case we might
have to visit them all.  Let's consider the worst case.

At each level, we perform only constant time operations
like comparisons and swaps.  So the total amount of work is
proportional to the number of levels in the tree, a.k.a.
the height.

So we might say that these operations are linear with respect to
the height of the tree, but the ``problem size'' we are interested
in is not height, it's the number of items in the heap.

As a function of , the height of the tree is .
This is not true for all trees, but it is true for complete
trees.  To see why, think of the number of nodes on each level
of the tree.  The first level contains 1, the second contains 2,
the third contains 4, and so on.  The th level contains
 nodes, and the total number in all levels up to  is
.  In other words, , which means that
.

 logarithmic time

Thus, both insertion and removal take logarithmic time.
To insert and remove  items takes time proportional to
.


===Heapsort===
 heapsort
 sorting
 analysis!heapsort

The result of the previous section suggests yet another algorithm
for sorting.  Given  items, we insert them into a Heap and
then remove them.  Because of the Heap semantics, they come
out in order.  We have already shown that this algorithm, which
is called heapsort, takes time proportional to ,
which is better than selection sort and the same as mergesort.

As the value of  gets large, we expect heapsort to be faster
than selection sort, but performance analysis gives us no way
to know whether it will be faster than mergesort.  We would say
that the two algorithms have the same order of growth because
they grow with the same functional form.  Another way to
say the same thing is that they belong to the same complexity
class.

 big-O notation
 complexity class
 order of growth
 constant time
 linear time
 quadratic time
 logarithmic time

Complexity classes are sometimes written in ``big-O notation''.
For example, , pronounced ``oh of
en squared'' is the set of all functions that grow no faster
than  for large values of .  To say that an algorithm
is  is the same as saying that it
is quadratic.  The other complexity classes we have seen,
in decreasing order of performance, are:

0.2in
tabularll
          &amp;  constant time  
     &amp;  logarithmic  
          &amp;  linear  
   &amp;  ``en log en''  
        &amp;  quadratic  
        &amp;  exponential
tabular
0.2in

So far none of the algorithms we have looked at are exponential.
For large values of , these algorithms quickly become impractical.
Nevertheless, the phrase
``exponential growth'' appears frequently in even non-technical
language.  It is frequently misused so I wanted to include its
technical meaning.

People often use ``exponential'' to describe any curve that is
increasing and accelerating (that is, one that has positive slope and
curvature).  Of course, there are many other curves that fit this
description, including quadratic functions (and higher-order
polynomials) and even functions as undramatic as .  Most
of these curves do not have the (often detrimental) explosive
behavior of exponentials.

As an exercise, compare the behavior of  and 
as the value of  increases.

There are a few different kinds of errors that can occur
in a program, and it is useful to distinguish between them
in order to track them down more quickly.

itemize

Compile-time errors are produced by the compiler and usually
indicate that there is something wrong with the syntax of the
program.  Example: omitting the semi-colon at the end of a
statement.

Run-time errors are produced by the run-time system if something
goes wrong while the program is running.  Most run-time errors
are Exceptions.  Example: an infinite recursion eventually causes
a StackOverflowException.

Semantic errors are problems with a program that compiles and
runs, but doesn't do the right thing.  Example: an expression may
not be evaluated in the order you expect, yielding an unexpected
result.

The first step in debugging is to figure out which kind of
error you are dealing with.  Although the following sections are
organized by error type, there are some techniques that are
applicable in more than one situation.


===Compile-time errors===

====The compiler is spewing error messages.====
 error messages
 compiler

If the compiler reports 100 error messages, that doesn't mean
there are 100 errors in your program.  When the compiler encounters
an error, it gets thrown off track for a while.  It tries to
recover and pick up again after the first error, but sometimes
it fails, and it reports spurious errors.

In general, only the first error message is reliable.  I suggest
that you only fix one error at a time, and then recompile the
program.  You may find that one semi-colon ``fixes'' 100 errors.
Of course, if you see several legitimate error messages, you
might as well fix more than one bug per compilation attempt.


====I'm getting a weird compiler message and it won't go away.====

First of all, read the error message carefully.  It is written
in terse jargon, but often there is a kernel of information
there that is carefully hidden.

If nothing else, the message will tell you where in the program the
problem occurred.  Actually, it tells you where the compiler was
when it noticed a problem, which is not necessarily where the error
is.  Use the information the compiler gives you as a guideline,
but if you don't see an error where the compiler is pointing,
broaden the search.

Generally the error will be prior to the location of the error
message, but there are cases where it will be somewhere else
entirely.  For example, if you get an error message at a method
invocation, the actual error may be in the method definition.

If you are building the program incrementally, you should have
a good idea about where the error is.  It will be in the last
line you added.

If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing 
your code to the book's code very carefully.  Check every character.
At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so
if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.

If you don't find the error quickly, take a breath and look more
broadly at the entire program.  Now is a good time to go through the
whole program and make sure it is indented properly.  I won't say that
good indentation makes it easy to find syntax errors, but bad
indentation sure makes it harder.

Now, start examining the code for the common syntax errors.
 syntax

enumerate

Check that all parentheses and brackets are
balanced and properly nested.  All method definitions should be nested
within a class definition.  All program statements should be within a
method definition.

Remember that upper case letters are not the same as
lower case letters.

Check for semi-colons at the end of statements (and
no semi-colons after squiggly-braces).

Make sure that any strings in the code have matching
quotation marks (and that you use double-quotes, not single).

For each assignment statement, make sure that the type
on the left is the same as the type on the right.

For each method invocation, make sure that the arguments
you provide are in the right order, and have right type, and that the
object you are invoking the method on is the right type.

If you are invoking a fruitful method, make sure you
are doing something with the result.  If you are invoking a
void method, make sure you are not trying to do something
with the result.

If you are invoking an object method, make sure you are
invoking it on an object with the right type.  If you are invoking
a class method from outside the class where it is defined, make
sure you specify the class name.

Inside an object method you can refer to the instance
variables without specifying an object.  If you try that in
a class method, you will get a confusing message like, ``Static
reference to non-static variable.''

enumerate

If nothing works, move on to the next section...


====I can't get my program to compile no matter what I do.====

If the compiler says there is an error and you don't see it, that
might be because you and the compiler are not looking at the same
code.  Check your development environment to make sure the program
you are editing is the program the compiler is compiling.  If you
are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax error
right at the beginning of the program.  Now compile again.  If
the compiler doesn't find the new error, there is probably something
wrong with the way you set up the project.

Otherwise, if you have examined the code thoroughly,
it is time for desperate measures.  You should start over with
a program that you can compile and then gradually add your code
back.

itemize

Make a copy of the file you are working on.  If you are
working on Fred.java, make a copy called Fred.java.old.

Delete about half the code from Fred.java.  Try compiling
again.

itemize

If the program compiles now, then you know the error is in
the other half.  Bring back about half of the code you deleted and
repeat.

If the program still doesn't compile, the error must be in
this half.  Delete about half of the code and repeat.

itemize

Once you have found and fixed the error, start bringing back
the code you deleted, a little bit at a time.

itemize

This process is called ``debugging by bisection.''  As an
alternative, you can comment out chunks of code instead of
deleting them.  For really sticky syntax problems, though,
I think deleting is more reliable---you don't have to worry
about the syntax of the comments, and by making the program
smaller you make it more readable.

 bisection!debugging by
 debugging by bisection

===Run-time errors===

====My program hangs.====
 infinite loop
 infinite recursion
 hanging

If a program stops and seems to be doing nothing, we
say it is ``hanging.''  Often that means that it is caught in
an infinite loop or an infinite recursion.

itemize

If there is a particular loop that you suspect is the
problem, add a print statement immediately before the loop
that says
``entering the loop'' and another immediately after that
says ``exiting the loop.''

Run the program.  If you get the first message and not
the second, you've got an infinite loop.  Go to the section
titled ``Infinite loop.''

Most of the time an infinite recursion will cause the program
to run for a while and then produce a StackOverflowException.
If that happens, go to the section
titled ``Infinite recursion.''

If you are not getting a StackOverflowException, but you suspect
there is a problem with a recursive method, you can still use
the techniques in the infinite recursion section.

If neither of those things works, start testing other
loops and other recursive methods.

If none of those things works, then it is possible that
you don't understand the flow of execution in your program.
Go to the section titled ``Flow of execution.''

itemize


=====Infinite loop=====

If you think you have an infinite loop and think you know
what loop is causing the problem, add a print statement at
the end of the loop that prints the values of the variables in
the condition, and the value of the condition.

For example,

verbatim
    while (x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0) 
        // do something to x
        // do something to y

        System.out.println (&quot;x: &quot; + x);
        System.out.println (&quot;y: &quot; + y);
        System.out.println (&quot;condition: &quot; + (x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 0));
    
verbatim

Now when you run the program you will see three lines of output
for each time through the loop.  The last time through the
loop, the condition should be false.  If the loops keeps
going, you will be able to see the values of x and y
and you might figure out why they are not being updated correctly.


=====Infinite recursion=====

Most of the time an infinite recursion will cause the program
to run for a while and then produce a StackOverflowException.

If you suspect that method is causing an infinite recursion,
start by checking to make sure that there is a base case.
In other words, there should be some condition that will
cause the method to return without making a recursive
invocation.  If not, then you need to rethink the algorithm
and identify a base case.

If there is a base case, but the program doesn't seem to be
reaching it, add a print statement
at the beginning of the method that prints the parameters.
Now when you run the program you will see a few lines
of output every time the method is invoked, and you will
see the parameters.
If the parameters are not moving toward the base case, you
will get some ideas about why not.


=====Flow of execution=====
 flow of execution

If you are not sure how the flow of execution is moving through
your program, add print statements to the beginning of each
method with a message like ``entering method foo,'' where
foo is the name of the method.

Now when you run the program it will print a trace of each
method as it is invoked.

It is often useful to print the parameters each method receives
when it is invoked.  When you run the program, check whether
the parameters are reasonable, and check for one of the
classic errors---providing parameters in the wrong order.


====When I run the program I get an Exception.====
 Exception

If something goes wrong during run time, the Java run-time
system prints a message that includes the name of the
exception, the line of the program where the problem occurred,
and a stack trace.

The stack trace includes the method that is currently running,
and then the method that invoked it, and then the method that
invoked that, and so on.  In other words, it traces the
path of method invocations that got you to where you are.

The first step is to examine the place in the program where
the error occurred and see if you can figure out what happened.

description

[NullPointerException:] You tried to access an instance
variable or invoke a method on an object that is currently
null.  You should figure out what variable is null
and then figure out how it got to be that way.

Remember that when you declare a variable with an object type,
it is initially null, until you assign a value to it.
For example, this code causes a NullPointerException:

verbatim
Point blank;
System.out.println (blank.x);
verbatim

[ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:] The index you are using
to access an array is either negative or greater than
array.length-1.  If you can find the site where the
problem is, add a print statement immediately before it to
print the value of the index and the length of the array.
Is the array the right size?  Is the index the right value?

Now work your way backwards through the program and see where
the array and the index come from.  Find the nearest assignment
statement and see if it is doing the right thing.

If either one is a parameter, go to the place where the method
is invoked and see where the values are coming from.

[StackOverFlowException:] See ``Infinite recursion.''

description


====I added so many print statements I get inundated with output.====
 print statement
 statement!print

One of the problems with using print statements for debugging
is that you can end up buried in output.  There are two ways
to proceed: either simplify the output or simplify the program.

To simplify the output, you can remove or comment out print
statements that aren't helping, or combine them, or format
the output so it is easier to understand.

To simplify the program, there are several things you can do.  First,
scale down the problem the program is working on.  For example, if you
are sorting an array, sort a small array.  If the program takes
input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the
error.

Second, clean up the program.  Remove dead code and reorganize the
program to make it as easy to read as possible.  For example, if you
suspect that the error is in a deeply-nested part of the program,
try rewriting that part with simpler structure.  If you suspect a
large method, try splitting it into smaller methods and test them
separately.

Often the process of finding the minimal test case leads you
to the bug.  For example, if you find that a program works when
the array has an even number of elements, but not when it has
an odd number, that gives you a clue about what is going on.

Similarly, rewriting a piece of code can help you find subtle
bugs.  If you make a change that you think doesn't affect the
program, and it does, that can tip you off.


===Semantic errors===

====My program doesn't work.====

In some ways semantic errors are the hardest, because the
compiler and the run-time system provide no information about
what is wrong.  Only you know what the program was supposed to
do, and only you know that it isn't doing it.

The first step is to make a connection between the program
text and the behavior you are seeing.  You need a hypothesis
about what the program is actually doing.  One of the things
that makes this hard is that computers run so fast.
You will often wish that you could slow the program down to
human speed, but there is no straightforward way to do that,
and even if there were, it is not really a good way to debug.

Here are some questions to ask yourself:

itemize

Is there something the program was supposed to do, but
doesn't seem to be happening?  Find the section of the code
that performs that function and make sure it is executing when
you think it should.  Add a print statement to the beginning
of the suspect methods.

Is something happening that shouldn't?  Find code in
your program that performs that function and see if it is
executing when it shouldn't.

Is a section of code producing an effect that is not
what you expected?  Make sure that you understand the code in
question, especially if it involves invocations to built-in
Java methods.  Read the documentation for the methods you invoke.
Try out the methods by invoking the methods directly with
simple test cases, and check the results.

itemize

In order to program, you need to have a mental model of how
programs work.  If your program that doesn't do what you expect,
very often the problem is not in the program; it's in your mental
model.

 model!mental
 mental model

The best way to correct your mental model is to break the program
into its components (usually the classes and methods) and test
each component independently.  Once you find the discrepancy
between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.

Of course, you should be building and testing components as you
develop the program.  If you encounter a problem, there should be only
a small amount of new code that is not known to be correct.

Here are some common semantic errors that you might want to check for:

itemize

If you use the assignment operator,
&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;, instead of the equality operator, &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;, in the
condition of an if, while or for statement,
you might get an expression that is sytactically legal, but
it doesn't do what you expect.

When you apply the equality operator, ==, to an
object, it checks shallow equality.  If you meant to check
deep equality, you should use the equals method (or
define one, for user-defined objects).

Some Java libraries expect user-defined objects to
define methods like equals.  If you don't define them
yourself, you will inherit the default behavior from the parent
class, which may not be what you want.

In general, inheritance can cause subtle semantic errors,
because you may be executing inherited code without realizing it.
Again, make sure you understand the flow of execution in your
program.

itemize


====I've got a big hairy expression and it doesn't do what I expect.====
 expression!big and hairy

Writing complex expressions is fine as long as they are readable,
but they can be hard to debug.  It is often a good idea to
break a complex expression into a series of assignments to
temporary variables.

For example:

verbatim
rect.setLocation (rect.getLocation().translate
                     (-rect.getWidth(), -rect.getHeight()));
verbatim

Can be rewritten as

verbatim
int dx = -rect.getWidth();
int dy = -rect.getHeight();
Point location = rect.getLocation();
Point newLocation = location.translate (dx, dy);
rect.setLocation (newLocation);
verbatim

The explicit version is easier to read, because the variable
names provide additional documentation, and easier to debug,
because we can check the types of the intermediate variables
and display their values.

 temporary variable
 variable!temporary
 order of evaluation
 precedence

Another problem that can occur with big expressions is
that the order of evaluation may not be what you expect.
For example, if you are translating the expression
 into Java, you might write

verbatim
double y = x / 2 * Math.PI;
verbatim

That is not correct, because multiplication and division have
the same precedence, and are evaluated from left to right.
So this expression computes .

A good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make
the order of evaluation explicit.

verbatim
double y = x / (2 * Math.PI);
verbatim

Any time you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use
parentheses.  Not only will the program be correct (in the sense
of doing what you intend); it will also be more readable for
other people who haven't memorized the rules of precedence.



====I've got a method that doesn't return what I expect.====
 return statement
 statement!return

If you have a return statement with a complex expression,
you don't have a chance to print the return value before
returning.  Again, you can use a temporary variable.  For
example, instead of

verbatim
public Rectangle intersection (Rectangle a, Rectangle b)  
    return new Rectangle (
        Math.min (a.x, b.x),
        Math.min (a.y, b.y),
        Math.max (a.x+a.width, b.x+b.width)-Math.min (a.x, b.x)
        Math.max (a.y+a.height, b.y+b.height)-Math.min (a.y, b.y) );

verbatim

You could write

verbatim
public Rectangle intersection (Rectangle a, Rectangle b)  
    int x1 = Math.min (a.x, b.x);
    int y2 = Math.min (a.y, b.y);
    int x2 = Math.max (a.x+a.width, b.x+b.width);
    int y2 = Math.max (a.y+a.height, b.y+b.height);
    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle (x1, y1, x2-x1, y2-y1);
    return rect;

verbatim

Now you have the opportunity to display any of
the intermediate variables before returning.


====My print statement isn't doing anything====
 print statement
 statement!print

If your use the println method, the output gets displayed
immediately, but if you use print (at least in some
environments) the output gets stored without being displayed until the
next newline character gets output.  If the program terminates without
producing a newline, you may never see the stored output.

If you suspect that this is happening to you, try changing
all the print statements to println.


====I'm really, really stuck and I need help====

First of all, try getting away from the computer for a few minutes.
Computers emit waves that affect the brain, causing the following
symptoms:

itemize

Frustration and/or rage.

Superstitious beliefs (``the computer hates me'') and
magical thinking (``the program only works when I wear my
hat backwards'').

Random walk programming (the attempt to program by writing
every possible program and choosing the one that does the right
thing).

itemize

If you find yourself suffering from any of these symptoms, get
up and go for a walk.  When you are calm, think about the program.
What is it doing?  What are some possible causes of that
behavior?  When was the last time you had a working program,
and what did you do next?

Sometimes it just takes time to find a bug.  I often find bugs
when I am away from the computer and I let my mind wander.  Some
of the best places to find bugs are trains, showers, and in bed,
just before you fall asleep.


====No, I really need help.====

It happens.  Even the best programmers occasionally get stuck.
Sometimes you work on a program so long that you can't see the
error.  A fresh pair of eyes is just the thing.

Before you bring someone else in, make sure you have exhausted
the techniques described here.  You program should be as simple
as possible, and you should be working on the smallest input
that causes the error.  You should have print statements in the
appropriate places (and the output they produce should be
comprehensible).  You should understand the problem well enough
to describe it concisely.

When you bring someone in to help, be sure to give
them the information they need.

itemize

What kind of bug is it?  Compile-time, run-time, or
semantic?

If the bug occurs at compile-time or run-time, what is
the error message, and what part of the program does it indicate?

What was the last thing you did before this error occurred?
What were the last lines of code that you wrote, or what is
the new test case that fails?

What have you tried so far, and what have you learned? 

itemize

When you find the bug, take a second to think about what you
could have done to find it faster.  Next time you see something
similar, you will be able to find the bug more quickly.

Remember, in this class the goal is not to make the program
work.  The goal is to learn how to make the program work.
Program development plan

If you are spending a lot of time debugging, it is probably
because you do not have an effective program development
plan.

A typical, bad program development plan goes something like
this:

enumerate

Write an entire method.

Write several more methods.

Try to compile the program.

Spend an hour finding syntax errors.

Spend an hour finding run time errors.

Spend three hours finding semantic errors.

enumerate

The problem, of course, is the first two steps.  If you
write more than one method, or even an entire method, before
you start the debugging process, you are likely to write more
code than you can debug.

If you find yourself in this situation, the only solution
is to remove code until you have a working program again, and
then gradually build the program back up.  Beginning programmers
are often unwilling to do this, because their carefully crafted
code is precious to them.  To debug effectively, you have to
be ruthless!


Here is a better program development plan:

enumerate

Start with a working program that does something visible,
   like printing something.

Add a small number of lines of code at a time,
   and test the program after every change.

Repeat until the program does what it is supposed to do.

enumerate

After every change, the program should produce some visible effect
that demonstrates the new code.  This approach to programming can save
a lot of time.  Because you only add a few lines of code at a time, it
is easy to find syntax errors.  Also, because each version of the
program produces a visible result, you are constantly testing your
mental model of how the program works.  If your mental model is
erroneous, you will be confronted with the conflict (and have a chance
to correct it) before you have written a lot of erroneous code.

One problem with this approach is that it is often
difficult to figure out a path from the starting place
to a complete and correct program.

I will demonstrate by developing a method called isIn
that takes a String and a Vector, and that returns a boolean:
true if the String appears in the list and false otherwise.

enumerate

The first step is to write the shortest possible method
that will compile, run, and do something visible:

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    System.out.println (&quot;isIn&quot;);
    return false;

verbatim

Of course, to test the method we have to invoke it.  In
main, or somewhere else in a working program, we need
to create a simple test case.

We'll start with a case where the String appears in the vector
(so we expect the result to be true).

verbatim
public static void main (String[] args) 
    Vector v = new Vector ();
    v.add (&quot;banana&quot;);
    boolean test = isIn (&quot;banana&quot;, v);
    System.out.println (test);

verbatim

If everything goes according to plan, this code will compile,
run, and print the word isIn and the value false.
Of course, the answer isn't correct, but at this point we know
that the method is getting invoked and returning a value.

In my programming career, I have wasted way too much time debugging
a method, only to discover that it was never getting invoked.
If I had used this development plan, it never would have happened.

The next step is to check the parameters the method
receives.

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    System.out.println (&quot;isIn looking for &quot; + word);
    System.out.println (&quot;in the vector &quot; + v);
    return false;

verbatim

The first print statement allows us to confirm that isIn
is looking for the right word.  The second statement prints a
list of the elements in the vector.

To make things more interesting, we might add a few more
elements to the vector:

verbatim
public static void main (String[] args) 
    Vector v = new Vector ();
    v.add (&quot;apple&quot;);
    v.add (&quot;banana&quot;);
    v.add (&quot;grapefruit&quot;);
    boolean test = isIn (&quot;banana&quot;, v);
    System.out.println (test);

verbatim

Now the output looks like this:

verbatim
isIn looking for banana
in the vector [apple, banana, grapefruit]
verbatim

Printing the parameters might seem silly, since we know what they
are supposed to be.  The point is to confirm that they are what we
think they are.


To traverse the vector, we can take advantage of the code
from Section vector.  In general, it is a great idea to
reuse code fragments rather than writing them from scratch.

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    System.out.println (&quot;isIn looking for &quot; + word);
    System.out.println (&quot;in the vector &quot; + v);

    for (int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) 
        System.out.println (v.get(i));
    
    return false;

verbatim

Now when we run the program it prints the elements of the
vector one at a time.  If all goes well, we can confirm that
the loop examines all the elements of the vector.


So far we haven't given much thought to what this method
is going to do.  At this point we probably need to figure out an
algorithm.  The simplest algorithm is a linear search, which
traverses the vector and compares each element to the target word.

Happily, we have already written the code that traverses the
vector.  As usual, we'll proceed by adding just a few lines
at a time:

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    System.out.println (&quot;isIn looking for &quot; + word);
    System.out.println (&quot;in the vector &quot; + v);

    for (int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) 
        System.out.println (v.get(i));
        String s = (String) v.get(i);
        if (word.equals (s)) 
            System.out.println (&quot;found it&quot;);
        
    
    return false;

verbatim

As always, we use the equals method to compare Strings,
not the == operator!

Again, I added a print statement so
that when the new code executes it produces a visible effect.

At this point we are pretty close to working code.  The
next change is to return from the method if we find what we are
looking for:

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    System.out.println (&quot;isIn looking for &quot; + word);
    System.out.println (&quot;in the vector &quot; + v);

    for (int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) 
        System.out.println (v.get(i));
        String s = (String) v.get(i);
        if (word.equals (s)) 
            System.out.println (&quot;found it&quot;);
            return true;
        
    
    return false;

verbatim

If we find the target word, we return true.
If we get all the way through the loop without finding it, then
the correct return value is false.

If we run the program at this point, we should get

verbatim
isIn looking for banana
in the vector [apple, banana, grapefruit]
apple
banana
found it
true
verbatim


The next step is to make sure that the other test cases
work correctly.  First, we should confirm that the method returns
false if the word in not in the vector.

Then we should check some of the typical troublemakers, like
an empty vector (one with size 0) and a vector with a single
element.  Also, we might try giving the method an empty String.

As always, this kind of testing can help find bugs if there
are any, but it can't tell you if the method is correct.

The penultimate step is to remove or comment out the print
statements.

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    for (int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) 
        System.out.println (v.get(i));
        String s = (String) v.get(i);
        if (word.equals (s)) 
            return true;
        
    
    return false;

verbatim

Commenting out the print statements is a good idea if you
think you might have to revisit this method later.  But if
this is the final version of the method, and you are convinced
that it is correct, you should remove them.

Removing the comments allows you to see the code most clearly,
which can help you spot any remaining problems.

If there is anything about the code that is not obvious, you
should add comments to explain it.  Resist the temptation to
translate the code line by line.  For example, no one needs this:

verbatim
        // if word equals s, return true
        if (word.equals (s)) 
            return true;
        
verbatim

You should use comments to explain non-obvious code, to warn
about conditions that could cause errors, and to document any
assumptions that are built into the code.  Also, before each
method, it is a good idea to write an abstract description of
what the method does.


The final step is to examine the code and see if you
can convince yourself that it is correct.  

At this point we know that the method is syntactically correct,
because it compiles.

To check for run time errors, you should find every statement
that can cause an error and figure out what conditions cause
the error.

The statements in this method that can produce a run time error
are:

tabularl l
v.size()          &amp; if v is null.              
word.equals (s)   &amp; if word is null.           
(String) v.get(i) &amp; if v is null or i is out of
                          bounds, 
                        &amp; or the th element of v is not
                          a String.
tabular

Since we get v and word as parameters, there is no way to avoid
the first two conditions.  The best we can do is check for them.

verbatim
public static boolean isIn (String word, Vector v) 
    if (v == null  word == null) return false;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;v.size(); i++) 
        System.out.println (v.get(i));
        String s = (String) v.get(i);
        if (word.equals (s)) 
            return true;
        
    
    return false;

verbatim

In general, it is a good idea for methods to make sure their
parameters are legal.

 instanceof operator
 operator!instanceof

The structure of the for loop ensures that i is always
between 0 and v.size()-1.  But there is no way to ensure that
the elements of v are Strings.  On the other hand, we can check
them as we go along.  The instanceof operator checks whether
an object belongs to a class.

verbatim
    Object obj = v.get(i);
    if (obj instanceof String) 
        String s = (String) v.get(i);
    
verbatim

This code gets an object from the vector and checks whether it
is a String.  If it is, it performs the typecast and assigns
the String to s.

As an exercise, modify isIn so that if it finds an
element in the vector that is not a String, it skips to the
next element.

If we handle all the problem conditions,
we can prove that this method will not cause a run time error.

We haven't proven yet that the method is semantically correct, but by
proceeding incrementally, we have avoided many possible errors.  For
example, we already know that the method is getting parameters
correctly and that the loop traverses the entire vector.  We also know
that it is comparing Strings successfully, and returning true if
it finds the target word.  Finally, we know that if the loop exists,
the target word cannot be in the vector.

Short of a formal proof, that is probably the best we can do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Input and Output in Java==

===System objects===

System is the name of the built-in class that contains
methods and objects used to get input from the keyboard,
print text on the screen, and do file input/output (I/0).

System.out is the name of the object we have used
to print text.  When you invoke print and println,
you invoke them on the object named System.out.

Interestingly, you can print System.out:

verbatim
System.out.println (System.out);
verbatim

The output is:

verbatim
java.io.PrintStream@80cc0e5
verbatim

As usual, when Java prints an object, it prints the type
of the object, which is PrintStream, the package
in which that type is defined, java.io, and a
unique identifier for the object.  On my machine the identifier
is 80cc0e5, but if you run the same code, you will
probably get something different.

There is also an object named System.in that has
type BufferedInputStream.  System.in makes it
possible to get input from the keyboard.  Unfortunately,
it does not make it easy to get input from the keyboard.

===Keyboard input===

First, you have to use System.in to create a new
InputStreamReader.

verbatim
    InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader (&quot;System.in&quot;);
verbatim

Then you use in to create a new BufferedReader:

verbatim
    BufferedReader keyboard = new BufferedReader (in);
verbatim

The point of all this manipulation is that there is a method
you can invoke on a BufferedReader, called readLine,
that gets input from the keyboard and converts it into a
String.  For example:

verbatim
    String s = keyboard.readLine ();
    System.out.println (s);
verbatim

reads a line from the keyboard and prints the result.

There is only one problem.  There are things that can go wrong
when you invoke readLine, and they might cause an
IOException.  There is a rule in Java that if a method might
cause an exception, it should say so.  The syntax looks
like this:

 verbatim
  public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException 
verbatim

This indicates that main might ``throw'' an IOException.
You can think of throwing an exception as similar to throwing
a tantrum.


===File input===

Reading input from a file is equally stupid.  Here is an
example:

verbatim
    public static void main (String[] args)
        throws FileNotFoundException, IOException 
	
        processFile (&quot;/usr/dict/words&quot;);
    

    public static void processFile (String filename)
        throws FileNotFoundException, IOException 

        FileReader fileReader = new FileReader (filename);
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader (fileReader);

        while (true) 
            String s = in.readLine();
            if (s == null) break;
            System.out.println (s);
        
    
verbatim

This program reads each line of the named file (/usr/dict/words)
into a String and then prints the line.  Again, the declaration 
throws FileNotFoundException, IOException is required by the
compiler.  The object types FileReader and BufferedReader
are part of the insanely complicated class hierarchy Java uses to do
incredibly common, simple things.  Other than that, you couldn't
possibly care how this program works.

===Arrays, Vectors and Tables===
 array
 Vector
 table

Arrays are a generally useful data structure, but they suffer
from two important limitations:

itemize

The size of the array does not depend on the number of
items in it.  If the array is too big, it wastes space.  If
it is too small it might cause an error, or we might have to
write code to resize it.

Although the array can contain any type of item, the
indices of the array have to be integers.  We cannot, for
example, use a String to specify an element of an array.

itemize

In Section vector we saw how the built-in Vector
class solves the first problem.  As the user adds items it
expands automatically.  It is also possible to shrink a Vector
so that the capacity is the same as the current size.

But Vectors don't help with the second problem.  The
indices are still integers.

That's where the Table ADT comes in.  The Table
is a generalization of the Vector that can use any type
as an index.  These generalized indices are called keys.

Just as you would use an index to access a value in an array,
you use a key to access a value in a Table.  So each
key is associated with a value, which is why Tables are sometimes
called associative arrays.

 dictionary
 associative array
 key
 entry
 index

A common example of a table is a dictionary, which is a table
that associates words (the keys) with their definitions (the
values).  Because of this example Tables are also sometimes called
Dictionaries.  Also, the association of a particular key with
a particular value is called an entry.


===The Table ADT===
 Table ADT
 ADT!Table

Like the other ADTs we have looked at, Tables are defined
by the set of operations they support:

description

[constructor:] Make a new, empty table. 

[put:]  Create an entry that associates a value with a key.

[get:]  For a given key, find the corresponding value.

[containsKey:]  Return true if there
is an entry in the Table with the given Key.

[keys]: Return a collection that contains all the keys
in the Table.

description


===The built-in Hashtable===
 Hashtable
 class!Hashtable

Java provides an implementation of the Table ADT called
Hashtable.  It is in the java.util package.
Later in the chapter we'll see why it is called Hashtable.

To demonstrate the use of the Hashtable we'll write
a short program that traverses a String and counts the number
of times each word appears.

We'll create a new class called WordCount that will
build the Table and then print its contents.  Naturally, each
WordCount object contains a Hashtable:

verbatim
public class WordCount 
    Hashtable ht;

    public WordCount () 
        ht = new Hashtable ();
    

verbatim

The only public methods for WordCount are processLine,
which takes a String and adds its words to the Table, and print,
which prints the results at the end.

processLine breaks the String into words using a 
StringTokenizer and passes each word to processWord.

verbatim
    public void processLine (String s) 
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer (s, &quot; ,.&quot;);
        while (st.hasMoreTokens()) 
            String word = st.nextToken();
            processWord (word.toLowerCase ());
        
    
verbatim

The interesting work is in processWord.

verbatim
    public void processWord (String word) 
        if (ht.containsKey (word)) 
            Integer i = (Integer) ht.get (word);
            Integer j = new Integer (i.intValue() + 1);
            ht.put (word, j);
         else 
            ht.put (word, new Integer (1));
        
    
verbatim

If the word is already in the table, we get its counter,
increment it, and put the new value.  Otherwise, we just
put a new entry in the table with the counter set to 1.


 Enumeration class
 class!Enumeration
 traverse

To print the entries in the table, we need to be able to traverse the
keys in the table.  Fortunately, the Hashtable implementation
provides a method, keys, that returns an Enumeration
object we can use.  Enumerations are very similar to the 
Iterators we saw in Section iterator.  Both are abstract
classes in the java.util package; you should review the
documentation of both.  Here's how to use keys to print
the contents of the Hashtable:

verbatim
    public void print () 
        Enumeration enum = ht.keys ();
        while (enum.hasMoreElements ()) 
            String key = (String) enum.nextElement ();
            Integer value = (Integer) ht.get (key);
            System.out.println (&quot; &quot; + key + &quot;, &quot; + value + &quot; &quot;); 
        
    
verbatim

Each of the elements of the Enumeration is an Object,
but since we know they are keys, we typecast them to be Strings.
When we get the values from the Table, they are also Objects,
but we know they are counters, so we typecast them to be Integers.

Finally, to count the words in a string:

verbatim
        WordCount wc = new WordCount ();
        wc.processLine (&quot;da doo ron ron ron, da doo ron ron&quot;);
        wc.print ();
verbatim

The output is

verbatim
 ron, 5 
 doo, 2 
 da, 2 
verbatim

The elements of the Enumeration are not in any particular order.
The only guarantee is that all the keys in the table will appear.


===A Vector implementation===
 implementation!Table
 table!vector implementation
 KeyValuePair

An easy way to implement the Table ADT is to use a Vector
of entries, where each entry is an object that contains a key
and a value.  These objects are called key-value pairs.

A class definition for a KeyValuePair might look like
this:

verbatim
class KeyValuePair 
    Object key, value;

    public KeyValuePair (Object key, Object value) 
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    

    public String toString () 
        return &quot; &quot; + key + &quot;, &quot; + value + &quot; &quot;;
    

verbatim

Then the implementation of Table looks like this:

verbatim
public class Table 
    Vector v;

    public Table () 
        v = new Vector ();
    

verbatim

To put a new entry in the table, we just add a new
KeyValuePair to the Vector:

verbatim
    public void put (Object key, Object value) 
        KeyValuePair pair = new KeyValuePair (key, value);
        v.add (pair);
    
verbatim

Then to look up a key in the Table we have to traverse the
Vector and find a KeyValuePair with a matching
key:

verbatim
    public Object get (Object key) 
        Iterator iterator = v.iterator ();
        while (iterator.hasNext ()) 
            KeyValuePair pair = (KeyValuePair) iterator.next ();
            if (key.equals (pair.key)) 
                return pair.value;
            
        
        return null;
    
verbatim

The idiom to traverse a Vector is the one we saw in
Section iterator.  When we compare keys, we use deep
equality (the equals method) rather than shallow
equality (the == operator).  This allows the key class
to specify the definition of equality.  In our example, the
keys are Strings, so it will use the built-in equals
method in the String class.

 traverse 

For most of the built-in classes, the equals method
implements deep equality.  For some classes, though, it is
not easy to define what that means.  For example, see the
documentation of equals for Doubles.

 equals
 equality

Because equals is an object method, this implementation
of get does not work if key is null.  We could
handle null as a special case, or we could do what the build-in
Hashtable does---simply declare that null is not a legal
key.

Speaking of the built-in Hashtable, it's implementation
of put is a bit different from ours.
If there is already an entry in the table with the given
key, put updates it (give it a new value), and returns
the old value (or null if there was none.
Here is an implementation of their version:

verbatim
    public Object put (Object key, Object value) 
        Object result = get (key);
        if (result == null) 
            KeyValuePair pair = new KeyValuePair (key, value);
            v.add (pair);
         else 
            update (key, value);
        
        return result;
    
verbatim

The update method is not part of the Table ADT, so
it is declared private.  It traverses the vector until
it finds the right KeyValuePair and then it updates
the value field.  Notice that we don't have to modify
the Vector itself, just one of the objects it contains.

verbatim
    private void update (Object key, Object value) 
        Iterator iterator = v.iterator ();
        while (iterator.hasNext ()) 
            KeyValuePair pair = (KeyValuePair) iterator.next ();
            if (key.equals (pair.key)) 
                pair.value = value;
                break;
            
        
    
verbatim

The only methods we haven't implemented are containsKey and 
keys.  The containsKey method is almost identical to get
except that it returns true or false instead of an object
reference or null.

As an exercise, implement keys by building a Vector of keys
and returning the elements of the vector.  See the documentation
of elements in the Vector class for more information.


===The List abstract class===
 abstract class!List
 List abstract class

The java.util package defines an abstract class called
List that specifies the set of operations a class has to
implement in order to be considered (very abstractly) a list.
This does not mean, of course, that every class that implements
List has to be a linked list.

Not surprisingly, the built-in LinkedList class is a member of
the List abstract class.  Surprisingly, so is Vector.

The methods in the List definition include add,
get and iterator.  In fact, all the methods from
the Vector class that we used to implement Table
are defined in the List abstract class.

That means that instead of a Vector, we could have used
any List class.  In Table.java we can replace
Vector with LinkedList, and the program still works!

This kind of type generality can be useful for tuning
the performance of a program.  You can write the program in
terms of an abstract class like List and then test the
program with several different implementations to see which
yields the best performance.


===Hash table implementation===
 implementation!Table
 implementation!hash table
 hash table!implementation
 table!hash table implementation

The reason that the built-in implementation of the Table ADT
is called Hashtable is that it uses a particularly efficient
implementation of a Table called a hashtable.

Of course, the whole point of defining an ADT is that it allows
us to use an implementation without knowing the details.  So it
is probably a bad thing that the people who wrote the Java
library named this class according to its implementation rather
than its ADT, but I suppose of all the bad things they did, this
one is pretty small.

Anyhoo, you might be wondering what a hashtable is, and why I
say it is particularly efficient.  We'll start by analyzing
the performance of the List implementation we just did.

Looking at the implementation of put, we see that there are
two cases.  If the key is not already in the table, then we
only have to create a new key-value pair and add it to
the List.  Both of these are constant-time operations.

In the other case, we have to traverse the List to find
the existing key-value pair.  That's a linear time operation.
For the same reason, get and containsKey are also
linear.

Although linear operations are often good enough, we can do
better.  It turns out that there is a way to implement the
Table ADT so that both put and get are constant time
operations!

The key is to realize that traversing a list takes time
proportional to the length of the list.  If we can put an upper
bound on the length of the list, then we can put an upper
bound on the traverse time, and anything with a fixed upper
bound is considered constant time.

 analysis!hashtable

But how can we limit the length of the lists without limiting
the number of items in the table?  By increasing the number
of lists.  Instead of one long list, we'll keep many short
lists.

As long as we know which list to search, we can put a bound
on the amount of searching.


===Hash Functions===
 hash function
 mapping

And that's where hash functions come in.  We need some way to
look at a key and know, without searching, which list it will
be in.  We'll assume that the lists
are in an array (or Vector) so we can refer to them by index.

The solution is to come up with some mapping---almost any
mapping---between the key values and the indices of the lists.
For every possible key there has to be a single index, but
there might be many keys that map to the same index.

For example, imagine an array of 8 lists and a table made
up of keys that are Integers and values that are
Strings.  It might be tempting to use the
intValue of the Integers as indices, since they
are the right type, but there are a whole lot of integers
that do not fall between 0 and 7, which are the only legal
indices.

 modulus
 operator!modulus

The modulus operator provides a simple
(in terms of code) and efficient (in terms of run time) way
to map all the integers into the range .
The expression

verbatim
    key.intValue() 
verbatim

is guaranteed to produce a value in the range from -7 to 7 (including
both).  If you take its absolute value (using Math.abs) you
will get a legal index.

For other types, we can play similar games.  For example,
to convert a Character to an integer, we can use
the built-in method Character.getNumericValue and
for Doubles there is intValue.

 shifted sum

For Strings we could get the numeric value of each character and
add them up, or instead we might use a shifted sum.  To
calculate a shifted sum, alternate between adding new values to the
accumulator and shifting the accumulator to the left.
By ``shift to the left'' I mean ``multiply by a constant.''

To see how this works, take the list of numbers
 and compute their shifted sum as
follows.  First, initialize the accumulator to 0.  Then,

enumerate

Multiply the accumulator by 10.

Add the next element of the list to the accumulator.

Repeat until the list is finished.

enumerate

As an exercise, write a method that calculates the shifted sum
of the numeric values of the characters in a String using
a multiplier of 32.

For each type, we can come up with a function that takes values of that
type and generates a corresponding integer value.  These
functions are called hash functions, because they often
involve making a hash of the components of the object.  The
integer value for each object is called its hash code.

There is one other way we might generate a hash code for
Java objects.  Every Java object provides
a method called hashCode that returns an integer
that corresponds to that object.  For the built-in types,
the hashCode method is implemented so that if two objects
contain the same data, they will have the same hash code
(as in deep equality).  The documentation of these methods
explains what the hash function is.  You should check them
out.

 deep equality
 hash function
 hash code

For user-defined types, it is up to the implementor to provide
an appropriate hash function.  The default hash function, provided
in the Object class, often uses the location of the
object to generate a hash code, so its notion of ``sameness''
is shallow equality.  Most often when we are searching a
hash table for a key, shallow equality is not what we want.

Regardless of how the hash code is generated, the last step
is to use modulus and absolute value to map the hash code
into the range of legal indices.


===Resizing a hash table===
 resizing
 hash table!resizing

Let's review.  A Hash table consists of an array (or Vector)
of Lists, where each List contains a small number
of key-value pairs.  To add a new entry to a table, we calculate
the hash code of the new key and add the entry to the
corresponding List.

To look up a key, we hash it again and search the corresponding list.
If the lengths of the lists are bounded then the search time is
bounded.

So how do we keep the lists short?  Well, one goal is to keep
them as balanced as possible, so that there are no very long
lists at the same time that others are empty.
This is not easy to do perfectly---it depends on how well we
chose the hash function---but we can usually do a pretty good
job.

Even with perfect balance, the average list length
grows linearly with the number of entries, and we have to put
a stop to that.

The solution is to keep track of the average number of entries
per list, which is called the load factor;
if the load factor gets too high, we have to resize the table.

 load factor
 rehashing

To resize, we create a new table, usually twice as big as the
original, take all the entries out of the old one, hash them again,
and put them in the new table.  Usually we can get away with using the
same hash function; we just use a different value for the modulus
operator.


===Performance of resizing===
 analysis!Hashtable

How long does it take to resize the table?  Clearly it is linear
with the number of entries.  That means that most of the
time put takes constant time, but every once in a while
---when we resize---it takes linear time.

At first that sounds bad.  Doesn't that undermine my
claim that we can perform put in constant time?  Well,
frankly, yes.  But with a little wheedling, I can fix it.

Since some put operations take longer than others, let's
figure out the average time for a put operation.  The
average is going to be , the constant time for a simple
put, plus an additional term of , the percentage of
the time I have to resize, times , the cost
of resizing.

equation
t(n) = c + p kn
equation

I don't know what  and  are, but we can figure out what
 is.  Imagine that we have just resized the hash table by
doubling its size.  If there are  entries, then we can add an
addition  entries before we have to resize again.  So the
percentage of the time we have to resize is .

Plugging into the equation, we get

equation
t(n) = c + 1/n kn = c + k
equation

In other words,  is constant time!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wrapper classes==

For every primitive type in Java, there is a built-in object type
called a wrapper class.  For example, the wrapper class for
int is called Integer; for double it is called
Double.

Wrapper classes are useful for several reasons:


Each wrapper class contains special values (like the
minimum and maximum values for the type) and methods that are useful
for converting between types.

You can instantiate wrapper classes and create objects
that contain primitive values.  In other words, you can wrap
a primitive value up in an object, which is useful if you want
to invoke a method that requires an object type.


===Creating wrapper objects===

The most straightforward way to create a wrapper object is
to use its constructor:

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (17);
    Double d = new Double (3.14159);
    Character c = new Character ('b');
verbatim

Technically String is not a wrapper class, because there
is no corresponding primitive type, but the syntax for creating
a String object is the same:

verbatim
    String s = new String (&quot;fred&quot;);
verbatim

On the other hand, no one ever uses the constructor for
String objects, because you can get the same effect
with a simple String value:

verbatim
    String s = &quot;fred&quot;;
verbatim

In my development environment, the Boolean wrapper class
has not been implemented correctly.  There is supposed to be
a constructor that takes a primitive boolean as an argument,
but the following code

verbatim
    Boolean b = new Boolean (true);
verbatim

generates an error.

===Creating more wrapper objects===

Some of the wrapper classes have a second constructor that takes
a String as an argument and tries to convert
to the appropriate type.  For example:

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (&quot;17&quot;);
    Double d = new Double (&quot;3.14159&quot;);
verbatim

There is supposed to be a Boolean constructor that
takes a String argument, but it has not been implemented
in my development environment.  There is no such constructor
for Characters.

The type conversion process is not very robust.
For example, if the Strings are not in the right format,
they will cause a NumberFormatException.  Any non-numeric
character in the String, including a space, will cause
the conversion to fail.

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (&quot;17.1&quot;);        // WRONG!!
    Double d = new Double (&quot;3.1459 &quot;);       // WRONG!!
verbatim

It is usually a good idea to check the format of the String
before you try to convert it.

===Creating even more wrapper objects===

Annoyingly, there is yet another way to create wrapper objects,
using class methods in the wrapper classes.

verbatim
    Integer i = Integer.valueOf (&quot;17&quot;);
    Double d = Double.valueOf (&quot;3.14159&quot;);
verbatim

These methods use the same conversion methods as the
constructors (parseInt and parseDouble), so
they are no more robust.

When there are two ways to do the same thing, it is probably
best to choose one and stick to it consistently.  In this
case, I think using the constructors is much better than
using valueOf, because it makes it much clearer that
you are creating new wrapper objects.  The name valueOf
is poorly chosen; given the name, it is not at all clear
what it does.

===Getting the values out===

Java knows how to print wrapper objects, so the easiest
way to extract a value is just to print the object:

verbatim
    Integer i = new Integer (17);
    Double d = new Double (3.14159);
    System.out.println (i);
    System.out.println (d);
verbatim

Alternatively, you can use the toString method to
convert the contents of the wrapper object to a String

verbatim
    String istring = i.toString();
    String dstring = d.toString();
verbatim

Finally, if you just want to extract the primitive value
from the object, there is an object method in each wrapper
class that does the job:

verbatim
    int iprime = i.intValue ();
    double dprime = d.doubleValue ();
verbatim

There are also methods for converting wrapper classes into
different primitive types.

===Useful methods in the wrapper classes===

As I mentioned, the wrapper classes contain useful
methods that pertain to each type.  For example, 
Integer contains methods for interpreting and
printing integers in different bases.  If you have
a String that contains a number in base 6,
you can convert to base 10 using parseInt.

verbatim
    String base6 = &quot;12345&quot;;
    int base10 = Integer.parseInt (base6, 6);
    System.out.println (base10);
verbatim

Since parseInt is a class method, you invoke it by
naming the class and the method in dot notation.

Base 6 might not be all that useful, but hexadecimal
(base 16) and octal (base 8) are common for computer science
related things.

In the Character class, there are lots of methods
for converting characters to upper and lower case, and for
checking whether a character is a number, letter, or symbol.

      <comment>Slight information error correction. Miranda is the closest MAJOR moon of Uranus, but not closest of all. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(moon)</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Miranda_as_seen_by_Voyager_2_-_GPN-2003-000005.jpg|right|220px|Miranda as seen from Voyager 2]]
'''Miranda''' is a moon of the planet Uranus. It is the smallest and innermost of Uranus's five major moons. It is sometimes called &quot;Uranus V&quot;.

The first pictures of this moon from a spacecraft were taken on January 24, 1986, when Voyager 2 passed by the planet. Only the southern half of Miranda has been viewed in detail, and the rest of the moon has yet to be seen.

==How big is Miranda?==
This moon has a diameter of only 472 km. This is slightly smaller than the asteroid Vesta, which is the second biggest object in the asteroid belt. Miranda would easily fit within the borders of the state of Arizona.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Miranda seems to be made almost entirely of ice. There are huge, deep canyons, some reaching over 19 km (12 mi) deep, and a lot of rugged ground, with some large, strange parallel grooves in parts the surface. There are also some craters on Miranda. This moon does not have any atmosphere and it is bitterly cold.

==How long is a day on Miranda?==
This moon takes the same time to orbit Uranus as it does to rotate around its axis. This means that it has become '''tidally locked'''. The gravity from Uranus has caused it to gradually slow its rotation until now it always keeps the same face toward the planet. The length of one orbit, and the length of a day on Miranda, is 1.41 days, or about 1 day and just under 10 hours.

==What is it made of?==
This moon is made of frozen stuff such as water ice, and it has a core of rock on the interior.

==How much would Miranda's gravity pull on me?==

'''Newtons''' describe how hard gravity is pulling you down.  On Earth, if you weigh 51 kilograms or 112 pounds, your weight is 500 newtons. We only use newtons for some special purposes, when we are really interested in how hard we push down on something because gravity is pulling us. 

Your weight in newtons would be less on Miranda, only about 1/124 of what it is on Earth.  To find your weight in newtons as you stand on Miranda, just take your weight on Earth, and if that weight is in kilograms, multiply it by 0.079.  Iff that weight is in pounds, divide it by 28 to get newtons.  But then you'll have to add in the weight of your spacesuit as well, because that is pressing down on the surface just like you are.

==Who is it named after?==
The English bard William Shakespeare wrote a play called &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In this play there is a sorcerer named Prospero who has a daughter called Miranda. Both the sorcerer and his daughter were stranded on an island for twelve years in the Adriatic sea.

The name of Shakespeare's character Miranda comes from the ''Latin'' root &quot;mira&quot;, which means &quot;to wonder&quot;. In the play the daughter is often called &quot;a wonder&quot;.

==How was it discovered?==
This moon was discovered by the astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who was born and educated in Holland, but later came to the United States. He found this moon on February 16, 1948. He also found Neptune's moon Neried just over a year later.

Data are assignments of values onto observations of events and objects. They can be classified by their coding properties and the characteristics of their domains and their ranges.

==Identifying data type==

When a given data set is numerical in nature, it is necessary to carefully distinguish the actual nature of the variable being quantified. Statistical tests are generally specific for the kind of data being handled.

===Data on a nominal (or categorical) scale===

Identifying the true nature of numerals applied to attributes that are not &quot;measures&quot; is usually straightforward and apparent. Examples in everyday use include road, car, house, book and telephone numbers. A simple test would be to ask if re-assigning the numbers among the set would alter the nature of the collection. If the plates on a car are changed, for example, it still remains the same car in reality.

===Data on an Ordinal Scale===

An ordinal scale is a scale with ranks. Those ranks only have sense in that they are ordered, that is what makes it ordinal scale.  The distance [rank ''n''] minus [rank ''n-1''] is not guaranteed to be equal to [rank ''n-1''] minus [rank ''n-2''], but [rank ''n''] will be greater than [rank ''n-1''] in the same way [rank ''n-1''] is greater than [rank ''n-2''] for all ''n'' where [rank ''n''], [rank ''n-1''], and [rank ''n-2''] exist. Ranks of an ordinal scale may be represented by a system with numbers or names and an agreed order.

We can illustrate this with a common example: the Likert scale.  Consider five possible responses to a question, perhaps ''Our president is a great man'', with answers on this scale

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Response: !!Strongly Disagree !! Disagree !! Neither Agree nor Disagree !! Agree !! Strongly Agree
|-
|'''Code''':|| 1|| 2|| 3|| 4|| 5
|}

Here the answers are a ranked scale reflected in the choice of numeric code.  There is however no sense in which the distance between ''Strongly agree'' and ''Agree'' is the same as between ''Strongly disagree'' and ''Disagree''.

Numerical ranked data should be distinguished from measurement data.

===Measurement data===

Numerical measurements exist in two forms, Meristic and continuous, and may present themselves in three kinds of scale: interval, ratio and circular.

'''Meristic''' or '''discrete''' variables are generally counts and can take on only discrete values. Normally they are represented by natural numbers. The number of plants found in a botanist's quadrant would be an example. (Note that if the edge of the quadrant falls partially over one or more plants, the investigator may choose to include these as halves, but the data will still be meristic as doubling the total will remove any fraction).

'''Continuous''' variables are those whose measurement precision is limited only by the investigator and his equipment. The length of a leaf measured by a botanist with a ruler will be less precise than the same measurement taken by micrometer. (Notionally, at least, the leaf could be measured even more precisely using a microscope with a graticule.)

'''Interval Scale'''
Variables measured on an interval scale have values in which differences are uniform and meaningful but ratios will not be so. An oft quoted example is that of the Celsius scale of temperature. A difference between 5° and 10° is equivalent to a difference between 10° and 15°, but the ratio between 15° and 5° does not imply that the former is three times as warm as the latter.

'''Ratio Scale'''
Variables on a ratio scale have a meaningful zero point. In keeping with the above example one might cite the Kelvin temperature scale. Because there is an absolute zero, it is true to say that 400°K is twice as warm as 200°K, though one should do so with tongue in cheek. A better day-to-day example would be to say that a 180 kg Sumo wrestler is three times heavier than his 60 kg wife.

'''Circular Scale''' 
When one measures annual dates, clock times and a few other forms of data, a circular scale is in use. It can happen that neither differences nor ratios of such variables are sensible derivatives, and special methods have to be employed for such data.

This book is meant for students and professionals who are looking for reference on different areas in this field, to bring a new student or new hire up to speed.

A scientific revolution less than 20 years old that has already changing the foods we eat and react to the environment.

''' To bring out the best in nature. '''

== What is Biotech? ==
Farmers and bakers were the pioneers of the biotech. Remember Grandma's freshly baked bread? How Grandpa kept the seeds of those really big pepper or tomatoes? Your grandparents were practicing biotechnology. Maybe you still do the same, that is the basis of biotechnology.

Defining &quot;Biotechnology&quot;

The application of the principles of engineering and the use of technology in the field of life sciences-bioengineering.

1 The use of living things to make products.
2 The study, application and control of a biological processes. 
3 The application of any of the above or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specifically defined uses.

The use of microorganisms (such as bacteria or yeasts) or biological substances (such as enzymes) to perform specific industrial or manufacturing processes. Applications include the production of certain drugs, synthetic hormones, and bulk foodstuffs, as well as the bioconversion of organic waste and the cleanup of oil spills.

Cloning, genetic manipulation, cell fusion, and mutation.

Modifying the genetic material of organisms directly and with increasing precision, has enabled the transfer of genes between extremely diverse organisms, in combinations unlikely to occur by non-technological means, allowing speedier and more specific results.

Essentially, doing &quot;more and faster&quot; building on what we have known and done for centuries and going beyond.

== Technician: Skills Needed ==

The Biotech Technician must be a person possessing skills with ability to solve problems and meet the customer in such a way that the translations of what is possible can be made clear.  They have to maintain a notebook, one that can be read by someone else.  Present results in a clear manner, and work with others to meet objectives.


=== Laboratory Skills ===

A technician must use the tools of the trade not unlike any other trade, we are farmers but our herd is tiny tiny wildlife. To take care of our herd we must measure certain aspects of their environment.

=== Solute,solvent, and solution ===

;Solute = Dry Material
;Solvent = What you mix with
;Solution = Solute + Solvent

=== pH ===

===== Measurement =====

#Probe and meter
most accurate
more expensive piece of equipment
Store in buffer
Check for clogging
#Litmus paper
very coarse measurement of pH
#Field kit

The letters pH stand for &quot;power of hydrogen&quot;

The most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen, which makes up about 3/4 of all matter!

Stronger acids give up more protons, H+ (hydrogen ions); stronger bases give up more OH- (hydroxide ions). Neutral substances have an even balance of H+ and OH-, E.g. Pure (distilled) water.

&gt;7 base --  7 Neutral  -- &lt;7 Acid

Depending on your definition, an acid is a hydrogen ion or proton donator and a base is a hydrogen ion acceptor, hydroxide ion donator, or electron acceptor.

Acids produce H+ ions in aqueous solutions, whereas bases produce OH- ions in aqueous solutions 

pH electrode compared to a battery

Store in buffer not H2O

Mercury tube
Good for metals and biologicals and up to 80 degrees C

The common Silver-Silver Chloride reference electrode used with most combination pH electrodes has a Potassium Chloride salt-bridge which is saturated with Silver Chloride.

Works well in most samples, but not in biological samples containing proteins or related materials

==== Calibration ====

Span error
Difference b/w perfect and actual pH Electrode at 25C produces 59.12 mV/pH unit

Offset error
;Difference from Perfect reading from actual reading is the offset error
signal @ pH 7.0 @ 25 C is 0 mV

'''Three point calibration'''
;pH's 4, 7 and 10

Calibrate W/I range you going to use

=== Buffer and reagent Prep ===

Chemist use buffers to moderate the pH of a reaction.
Buffers stabilize a solution at a specific pH value.
Resist pH change when small amounts of acid or alkali are added.

'''KPO4'''

KPO4 buffer is highly recommended for most P450 assays (microsomal or recombinant enzymes) with the exception of CYP 2C9 and 2A6 where a Tris buffer system is more appropriate.
 
'''TRIS buffer'''

TRIS buffers are used by biochemists to control pH in the physiological range (about 7 to 8 pH) because phosphates cause undesirable side reactions with the biological substances in their test samples. 


'''&quot;Good&quot; buffers'''

These buffers were well received by the research community because &quot;Good&quot; buffers are nontoxic, easy to purify and their pKa is typically between 6.0 and 8.0, the range at which most biological reactions occur. 

The &quot;Good&quot; buffers also feature minimal penetration of membranes, minimal absorbance in the 240-700 nm range and minimal effects due to salt, concentration or temperature.


pKa = dissociation constant


In chemistry and biochemistry, a dissociation constant or an ionization constant is a specific type of equilibrium constant used for dissociation (ionization) reactions.
Dissociation in chemistry and biochemistry is a general process in which complexes, molecules, or salts separate or split into smaller molecules, ions, or radicals, usually in a reversible manner. Dissociation is the opposite of association and recombination.

===== What is Agar? =====
A gelatinous material derived from certain marine algae.

# Growth Media
# Carbon Sources
# Carbohydrates
# Proteins
# Nitrogen Sources

Two types:
; Simple
; Complex

Components required for preparing a minimal agar
#minerals
#H2O
#vitamins
#Precursors
# Compounds that may lead to your product - inducers
# Compounds added to induce gene expression

LB (Luria-Bertani) Media

===== Agar Plates =====

====== Blood ======
contains blood cells from an animal (e.g. a sheep). 
Most bacteria will grow on this medium

====== Chocolate ====== 
This contains lysed blood cells, and is used for growing fastidious (fussy) respiratory bacteria.

====== Mannitol Salt ======
Purpose Mannitol salt agar is both a selective and differential growth medium.

====== Brilliant Green ====== 
Inhibits Gram+
MacConkey

This type of agar is used since it is one of the most forgiving media available - it is hard to contaminate, and E. coli usually grow up as red colonies.

(Almost all spore forming bacteria are Gram-positive, but these cannot grow on MacConkey agar because of the detergent in it (bile salts), and very few Gram-negative bacteria can tolerate either the initial dryness of the plates, or the boiling temperatures needed to make the MacConkey agar. Also, while fungal spores can tolerate the dryness, they cannot tolerate the boiling.)

This is an agar upon which only Gram-negative bacteria can grow 

Starch

An agar plate is a sterile Petri dish that contains agar plus nutrients, and is used to culture bacteria or fungi.

====== Neomycin agar ====== 
contains the antibiotic neomycin.

====== Sabouraud agar ====== 
Used for fungi. It contains gentamicin and has a low pH that will kill most bacteria.

====== LB ======

==== UV/VIS Spectroscopy ====

Common UV/ VIS spectrophotometers  Following is a list of commonly used spectrophotometers: 
GeneSys 20     HP8452A Diode Array Spectronic 20

Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy or Ultraviolet-Visible spectrophotometry (UV/ VIS) involves the spectroscopy of photons (spectrophotometry). It uses light in the visible and adjacent near ultraviolet (UV) and near infrared (NIR) ranges. In this region of energy space molecules undergo electronic transitions.

====Gel Electrophoresis ====

Gel electrophoresis is a method that separates macromolecules-either nucleic acids or proteins-on the basis of size, electric charge, and other physical properties.  Researchers can typically control the charge at the top and bottom of the gel.  DNA is negatively charged so to run it through the gel, the top would have to be set to - and the bottom to +. 

'''materials''' 

;Two basic types: '''agarose'''  and '''polyacrylamide'''

'''agarose''' 

Agarose is a natural colloid extracted from sea weed
It is very fragile and easily destroyed by handling
Agarose gels have very large &quot;pore&quot; size and are used primarily to separate very large molecules with a molecular mass greater than 200 kDaltons
Agarose gels can be processed faster than polyacrylamide gels, but their resolution is inferior.

Agarose is a linear polysaccharide (average molecular mas about 12,000) made up of the basic repeat unit agarobiose, which comprises alternating units of galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose. Agarose is usually used at concentrations between 1% and 3%.  
Agarose is a chain of sugar molecules, and is extracted from seaweed.

Perhaps you have seen the terms TBE or TAE. 

These are names of two commonly used buffers in electrophoresis.

The &quot;T&quot; stands for Tris, a chemical which helps maintain a consistent pH of the solution.

The &quot;E&quot; stands for EDTA, which itself is another anacronym. EDTA chelates (gobbles up) divalent cations like magnesium. This is important because most nucleases require divalent cations for activity, and you certainly wouldn't want any stray nucleases degrading your sample while it's running through the gel, would you?

Finally, the &quot;B&quot; or &quot;A&quot; stand for Boric acid or Acetic acid, which provide the proper ion concentration for the buffer.

'''polyacrylamide'''

The polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique was introduced by Raymond and Weintraub (1959).

Polyacrylamide is the same material that is used for skin electrodes and in soft contact lenses.

provide a wide variety of electrophoretic conditions:

By controlling the percentage (from 3% to 30%), precise pore sizes can be obtained, usually from 5 to 2,000 kdal. 
Polyacrylamide gels can be cast in a single percentage or with varying gradients
Polyacrylamide gels offer greater flexibility and more sharply defined banding than agarose gels.

Aseptic techniques is defined as a method that keeps undesirable microbes from contaminating a pure culture.

Only a single species of an organism is what one should work with in a microorganismal laboratory all materials that will be used for transfer, growth, and experimentation of the microbe must be sterilized media and glassware most often is sterilized by using an autoclave.

Lab bench needs to be clean with a disinfectant before and after working.

Hands should be washed upon entering and leaving the laboratory.

Inoculation tools and the tops of tubes need to be sterilized over an flame

&quot;Geneticist and science writer Steve Jones argues that humanity does not, and will never have the technology that proponents of transhumanism seek. He once joked that the letters of the genetic code, A, C, G and T should be replaced with the letters H, Y, P and E. Jones claims that technologies like genetic engineering will never be as powerful as is popularly believed.&quot;

=== ''E. Coli'' The workhorse of molecular biology ===

Theodor Escherich isolates a microbe from the colon that is later given the name Escherichia coli in his honor.

#Ecoli
##HB101
###Fairly safe
###Needs
###37 C
###Food
###H2O
###Vitamins

Escherichia coli, a subgroup of fecal coliform bacteria that is present in the intestinal tracts and feces of warm-blooded animals. 

It is used as an indicator of the potential presence of pathogens. There are many different strains of E. coli that are classified into more than 170 serogroups.

Although most strains of E. coli are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals, the E. coli O157:H7 strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness.

Its presence in groundwater is a common indicator of fecal contamination.

(&quot;Enteric&quot; is the adjective that describes organisms that live in the intestines. &quot;Fecal&quot; is the adjective for organisms that live in feces, so it is often a synonym for &quot;enteric.&quot;) The name comes from its discoverer, Theodor Escherich.

== Problem Set ==
1. Is there a rule to determine whether a 3-digit number is divisible by 11? If so, derive that rule.

2. Show that ''p'', ''p + 2'' and ''p + 4'' cannot all be primes if p is an integer greater than 3.

3. Find x 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x \equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 + 4^7 + 5^7 + 6^7 + 7^7 \ \pmod{7}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

4. Show that there are no integers x and y such that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - 5y^2 = 3 \!&lt;/math&gt;

5. In modular arithmetic, if
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv y \pmod{m} \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''m'', then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{y} \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;
we say, ''x'' is the square root of ''y'' mod ''m''.

Note that if ''x'' satisfies ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''y'', then ''m'' - ''x'' &amp;equiv; -''x'' when squared is also equivalent to ''y''. We consider both ''x'' and -''x'' to be square roots of ''y''.

Let ''p'' be a prime number. Show that

'''(a)'''
:&lt;math&gt;
(p-1)! \equiv -1\ \mbox{(mod p)}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;
n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n 
&lt;/math&gt;
E.g. 3! = 1*2*3 = 6

'''(b)'''

Hence, show that
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \equiv \frac{p - 1}{2}! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
for ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4), i.e., show that the above when squared gives one.</text>

== Project -- The Square Root of -1 ==
'''Notation:''' In modular arithmetic, if
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv y \pmod{m} \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''m'', then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{y} \pmod{m}&lt;/math&gt;
we say, ''x'' is the square root of ''y'' mod ''m''.

Note that if ''x'' satisfies ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;equiv; ''y'', then ''m'' - ''x'' &amp;equiv; -''x'' when squared is also equivalent to ''y''. We consider both ''x'' and -''x'' to be square roots of ''y''.

1. Question 5 of the Problem Set showed that
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{-1} \equiv \sqrt{p-1} \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
exists for ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) prime. Explain why no square root of -1 exist if ''p'' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 4) prime.

2. Show that for ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) prime, there are exactly 2 solutions to
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{-1} \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;

3. Suppose ''m'' and ''n'' are integers with gcd(''n'',''m'') = 1. Show that for each of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, .... , ''nm'' - 1 there is a unique pair of numbers ''a'' and ''b'' such that the smallest number ''x'' that satisfies:
:''x'' &amp;equiv; a (mod m)
:''x'' &amp;equiv; b (mod n)
is that number.
E.g. Suppose m = 2, n = 3, then 4 is uniquely represented by
:''x'' &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 2)
:''x'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 3)
as the smallest ''x'' that satisfies the above two congruencies is ''4''. In this case the unique pair of numbers are 0 and 1.

4. If ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) prime and ''q'' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 4) prime. Does
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{-1} \pmod{pq}&lt;/math&gt;
have a solution? Why?

5. If ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) prime and ''q'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4) prime and p &amp;ne; q. Show that 
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{-1} \pmod{pq}&lt;/math&gt;
has 4 solutions.

6. Find the 4 solutions to
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{-1} \pmod{493} &lt;/math&gt;
note that 493 = 17 &amp;times; 29.

7. Take an integer ''n'' with more than 2 prime factors. Consider:
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv \sqrt{-1} \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;
Under what condition is there a solution? Explain thoroughly.</text>

      <comment>/* Overnight builds */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Release Management''' refers to management of the release cycle within a software project, which itself is when the software engineers provide a uniquely identified set of files for others to use. The others may be their department at work, their classmates at university, or The World.  The set of files (perhaps a single file) constitute the software release.  Managing the release means the software release manager knows:

* What went into it
* Where it went
* Why it went there
* How to deal with it when bugs are reported

Building software is the generic term applied to the compilation or aggregation of sources into a usable utility or application. Sources needn't be compiled (built) in the classic sense, which relies upon a compiler linking files together; modern systems may consist entirely of interpreted source files (such as those for Perl or PHP). Still, putting everything together in a usable format may be considered &quot;building&quot;.

The larger and more complex the software project becomes, the greater the need for an extremely well-managed Build and Release function.

Several features are characteristic of the Build and Release process.  The most common are use of overnight builds, normalized build numbering, high degrees of automation, scheduling and reuse, use of notification, metadata capture and storage, and implementation of a project portal or viewer.

== Overnight builds ==

This is a basic function that accomplishes two primary objectives:

# It establishes the code-wise integration of the project.
# It immediately alerts you to code-wise disintegration. 

These may sound like the same thing, but they aren't. The software engineer expects to see code-wise integration as the project matures; the overnight build confirms he/she has it. He/she does not expect to see code-wise disintegration (the &quot;it built yesterday, but not today&quot; problem), and thus wants to know immediately when it is encountered. Engineers should be the only ones who see legitimate code-wise disintegration. They should catch it during their unit tests and fix it prior to committing to the project. By running overnight builds, the engineer has no more than 24 hours of source code changes to review and/or back out if the build breaks.

Overnight builds also give the QA department something against which to execute test cases and to target for specific bug regressions. Overnight builds help the software project team stay on schedule by reducing the amount of time required to resolve real code integration issues.

== Competent Build Numbering ==

When the team builds the project every night (or continuously), the need exists for a build numbering scheme along with rules for build publication. Build publication rules refer to what builds get published for QA consumption and the target for that publication.  A special directory structure on a specific machine is sufficient for this purpose. Project team members determine this up front, start using it, and do not change it over the course of the project. Throughout the entire project cycle, any interested party can quickly look at any build.  The numbering scheme must be flexible enough to provide specific, built-in meaning in the number itself. For example:

 foobar20110

This build &quot;number&quot; allows for visible identification of its contents. Anyone on the project may look at this number and know the build contains:

* Foobar
* Version 2 source
* Internal build # 110 

The release manager and the build engineer must establish a numbering scheme that is easily incremented via automated build scripts. 

== Automation ==

Human error is an acceptable risk on trivial, performed-once operations such as writing an email message. Human error is not an acceptable risk when building and releasing your software. If the steps for the procedure may be entered into the keyboard, the procedure can probably be automated.  Well designed automation modules may be reused elsewhere in the project, as well as in other separate projects.

== Auto-generated Build Numbers ==

Embedding build numbers in the source code is common.  This allows a user of the software application to open an &quot;About&quot; or &quot;Version&quot; screen and receive information about the application's version and build number.  This is useful in support and upgrade situations.  The user sees something like &quot;Version 12.3 Build 1234&quot;. Those strings came from the source code, often from hand-editing prior to that build.  That process - the generation of the build number and its insertion into the source code - may be automated.  The release engineer must develop a script or other piece of automation code that reads the master build number file, increments and caches it, opens the source file with the build and version string in it, greps or searches for the string in the file, does a replace, closes the file, commits it, and tags it.  The build number is now in the source code prior to build process.

== Scheduling ==

Well run release management is similar to other aspects of the software development project in that it is highly dependent upon the completion of scheduled tasks.  Builds are the single most important scheduled task that produces artifacts for the release management process.  The release manager must ensure that the build schedule is predictable and maintained. One mechanism for achieving is through use of job schedulers like cron or at.  This allows the release manager to establish a schedule for builds, publications and deployments that is automatically enforced.

== Reuse ==

Reuse of automation modules allows the release manager to compress more activity into available time, increasing productivity without a corresponding increase in hands-on work. Examples of automation modules that may be reused within and across projects include those for email notification, source code checkout and checkin, file copying, and deployment.

== Notification ==

It is advantageous for the release engineer to be notified of the success or failure of any given release or build procedure.  Automatic notification from within the release process provides this.  At the conclusion of a build, a simple &quot;Build OK&quot; message may be sent to the project team.   The message may include a hyper-link to a log file with details and the team benefits from quickly receiving status.  Similarly, when the build is broken, the notification immediately alerts the team with a &quot;Build Broken&quot; message that can be investigated.

== Project Portal ==

Web servers can be easily deployed and have come into popular use as a presentation manager for build and release metadata.  Projects members and other interested parties may obtain project status, with the proper level of detail for their purposes, by viewing a page in their web browser. Several well developed tools exist for this purpose, including Anthill, CruiseControl, and BuildMaster.

== Database storage ==

Building and releasing software produces significant metadata, both in volume and importance.  The release manager is interested in
*build and release trends, which provide insight into improving future release cycles
*audit logs which provide historical records on the migration of specific software changes.
Examples of build metadata include:

* Build number
* Build date
* Build version
* Source code label or tag used
* Overnight build (Y/N)
* QA tested (Y/N)
* QA test results (Pass/Fail)
* Location of full logs 

The release manager may use any RDBMS; several are freely available and can be quickly set up on a low-cost computer running any of the free operating systems.  Existing build logs may be imported for historical data housing.  Build metadata may vary from project to project, and it is generally accepted that there is a practical limit to the amount of metadata to be stored.  For example, even though the release manager may capture and store data like &quot;Number of binary files included in the build&quot;, it must be considered whether the data is meaningful.  Simply because a piece of data is available, it doesn't automatically become information.

'''Aramba&amp;#353;i&amp;#263;i''', kraut rolls, speciality from [[w:Sinj|Sinj]], [[w:Croatia|Croatia]]

==Ingredients==
* 600 g [[cookbook:beef|beef]] (best from the neck)
* 150 g smoked [[cookbook:ham|ham]] or [[cookbook:bacon|bacon]]
* 50–60 g [[cookbook:suet|suet]] from ox kidneys
* 200 g [[cookbook:pork|pork]]
* smoked pork
* [[cookbook:mutton|mutton]]
* raw ham or smoked tongue
* broth or water
* 2 large [[cookbook:onion|onion]]s
* some [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* [[cookbook:clove|clove]]s
* grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon rind]]
* [[cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* some ground [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 2–3 crushed cloves
* 1 grind [[cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* 1 head of [[cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] (or fresh white of grape leaves)

==Preparation==

# Finely chop beef, bacon, suet and pork, and place in a large bowl. Chopping the meat is better than running through a grinder, and in this way it retains more of its flavour. 
# Next add the chopped onions, garlic cloves, grated lemon rind, salt and pepper, a little cinnamon, crushed cloves and ground nutmeg.
# Mix all the ingredients well; knead together with your hands, if desired.
# Separate the leaves from the sauerkraut head, setting aside the better ones for stuffing. 
# Cut away part of the leaf stalk at the base. 
# Add a spoonful of the meat mixture to each kraut leaf. 
# Roll the Aramba&amp;#353;ici from the base of each leaf, and fold the ends together well so that they do not fall apart during cooking.
# Put 1 spoonful of grease in a deep stoneware casserole dish.
# Pack and layer the Aramba&amp;#353;ici rolls tightly next to one another in the casserole dish.
# Layer smoked meat (possibly home-made smoked ham (pr&amp;#353;ut) or smoked tongue) between the layers of kraut rolls.
# Pour the broth of water over the Aramba&amp;#353;ici, cover tightly and cook three to four hours over low heat. 
# Shake casserole form several times, but do not stir.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* It is best to pre-cook the Aramba&amp;#353;ici in the evening, and on the following day cook until done.
* Apart from other ingredients, fresh sauerkraut is the most important for good and tasty Aramba&amp;#353;ici. 
* Aramba&amp;#353;ici is also delicious in the summer. Should you not be able to find any sauerkraut in the summer, you can also use fresh cabbage or grape leaves. Sort out the leaves and blanch them with boiling water to soften them. Fill with the Aramba&amp;#353;ici mixture and cook in the same manner as with the sauerkraut leaves.

In the Cookbook ‘Meat’ is a somewhat general ingredient super-category, the contours of which can be vague around the edges. 

For some, the term ‘Meat’ may mean, strictly, only muscle tissue, but includes the muscle tissue of any animal.  ‘Meat’ would then include the muscle tissue of any animal whatsoever, and leave out other parts of the animal which are used in cooking, a result others may take exception to. 


However, as a rule of thumb, in the Cookbook:

* if it is an animal that &lt;u&gt;can not&lt;/u&gt; breathe under water, it (and all edible parts of it, whether muscle tissue or not) will likely be categorized under ‘Meat’ or 'Meat and poultry', although [[W:Birds|Birds]] are often separately categorized under 'Poultry', and 
* all animals that &lt;u&gt;can&lt;/u&gt; breathe under water (whether fresh or salt water) will likely be categorized under ‘Seafood’.

== Defining sin and cosine.png ==

Is it possible to move the image you created, [[:Image:Defining sin and cosine.png]], to the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page wikimedia commons]? That way I might use it in the brazilian wikibooks (and all other projects), like here: [http://pt.wikibooks.org/wiki/Matemática_elementar/Trigonometria/Razões_trigonométricas_na_circunferência Trigonometric ratios in the circle].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &quot;out of the box&quot; GNOME desktop is rather dull and boring (at least to some people). Here's how to make it a bit more interesting :
1. Delete the upper panel which contains the main GNOME menus.
2. Now, to the lower panel, add the '''Main Menu''', the '''Clock''', the '''Notification Area''', the '''Desktop Switcher''' and the '''Window List''' by right clicking and clicking '''Add to Panel''' on the lower panel. Position all this as you please by dragging the applets around a bit.
3. Right click on the lower panel and click '''Preferences''' and increase the panel size as appropriate.
4. Go to [http://www.gnome-look.org GNOME Look] or [http://art.gnome.org GNOME Art] and download some wallpapers, icon themes, window borders, application themes or complete themes featuring all of the above components (GTK+ Themes).
Now read on to know how to use all this stuff.

== Adding Wallpapers ==
Right click on the GNOME desktop and click '''Change Desktop Background''' and then in the dialogue that pops up choose '''Add Wallpaper''' and choose the appropriate wallpaper(s). Alternatively, you can just drag the wallpapers into the '''Change Desktop Background''' dialogue.

== Adding Themes ==
Go to the '''Main Menu''' -&gt; '''System''' -&gt; '''Preferences''' -&gt; '''Themes''' and click '''Install Theme'''. Choose a theme file by entering the exact location or by clicking '''Browse''' (usually ending in ''.tar.gz'') and click '''Install Theme''' to install it. Alternatively, you can drag the theme files to the '''Themes''' dialogue.
Please note that the icon themes and window borders might not show up in the themes list. To access those, just click on '''Theme Details''' and click the appropriate tab. Now you can select the theme you installed from the list.

There you are. Now the dull GNOME desktop looks lively again!

==Making screenshots==
A [[w:screenshot|screenshot]] can be captured by either selecting &quot;Take Screenshot...&quot; from the &quot;Actions&quot; menu (in GNOME versions older than 2.10), by selecting &quot;Take Screenshot&quot; from the &quot;System...&quot; menu (GNOME 2.10 or greater), by using the screenshot applet or by using one of the following two keyboard shortcuts, configured in Preferences &amp;rarr; Keyboard Shortcuts:
* Print Screen, to take a screenshot of the entire screen, or
* Alt + Print Screen, to take a screenshot of the currently active window.
The screenshot is saved in [[w:PNG|PNG]] format.

==Defining Default Directories==
Sometimes it's worth to define custom directories locations. Ex: Music, Videos, etc.
It can be done editing file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and setting custom places for these personal stuff.
Use it to recover from some mess eventually done by another environment or application. In my case something moved my Desktop folder inside Burning folder. I had to figure out how to set it back to correct place grepping a little: simply I couldn't find out how to do it using regular setup menus or gconf-editor.

A small simple corn [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]], similar to a johnnycake, originally cooked in ashes, and introduced to early European settlers by indigenous Americans. Also known as &quot;corn pone&quot; in the Southern United States.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Quart|qt]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|Indian meal (cornmeal)]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] (optional)

==Procedure==
# Put on the water in a pot, and as soon as it [[Cookbook:Boiling|boils]] stir in as much cornmeal as will make a very thin [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]].
# Beat it frequently while it is boiling, which will require ten minutes; then take it off, pour it in a pan, and add the butter, and salt to taste.
# When the batter is luke-warm stir in as much Indian meal as will make it quite thick.
# Let rise overnight.
# Pat the dough out into small cakes.
# Butter a baking tin and bake in a moderate oven '''or''' butter a cake pan, fill it 3/4 full, and bake. 

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* This recipe did not originally have an oven temperature; 350 degrees Fahrenheit is probably safe.

==References==
* {{1881}}

'''Hummus''' is a nutritious dip originating from the Middle East. It is called ''revythosaláta'' (ρεβυθοσαλάτα) in Greek.
==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] raw dried [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]] (or skip the soaking and cooking steps, and use 7 cups of drained tinned/canned chickpeas)
* 9 cups water (twice)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* ¾ cup (175 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]] (ground sesame seeds)
* ¾ cup freshly squeezed [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 12 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (peeled and roughly chopped)
* ½ cup extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 T [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] freshly ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* approximately ¾ cup chickpea cooking liquid

==Procedure==
# Soak the chickpeas in water overnight, then drain.
# Gently simmer the chickpeas with the next lot of water (generously salted) and the tablespoon of oil until very soft, but still whole (about 3 hours, or 10 minutes + cooling time if using a pressure cooker).
# Drain the chickpeas, and reserve a few cups of the cooking liquid (you will need it later).
# Rinse the chickpeas with plenty of cold water, while doing so, gently rub them between your hands to release the skins, they should float away with the rinsing water. After several changes of water, and removing a majority of the skins, drain the chickpeas again.
# Using a [[Cookbook:Food processor|food processor]] (or other means), mix the lemon juice with the tahini.
# [[Cookbook:Purée|Purée]] (or mash) the chickpeas in batches, using the lemon juice and tahini mixture, the olive oil, and the cooking liquid as required to maintain the desired consistency (add the garlic to the batch with the olive oil, and process until smooth).
# In a large bowl, using a spoon, mix the salt and pepper into the other blended ingredients (add additional cooking liquid, if still too thick).

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* 1-2 tablespoons of asafoetida (hing) can be used to substitute for the garlic.
* Use Baking Soda while soaking the chickpeas to take away its gas generating effect.
* Use a pot that will hold several times the volume of the chickpeas and the water for cooking the chickpeas, because they will foam (the tablespoon of oil minimises that, however).
* Use olive oil (or Canola oil, it's cheaper) instead of the reserved cooking liquid to thin the hummus, it's nicer, but not as good for you. Alternatively, mix in a tablespoon of olive oil into a serving before eating.
* It's particularly good when eaten with sliced French stick ([[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]), and it is traditionally eaten with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita pita] bread. It is also a nutritionally sound alternative to most other dips.
* Hummus freezes really well, so consider making a double batch, and then freezing most of it in containers small enough to hold two servings (they can be defrosted overnight in the refrigerator, as needed).
* Hummus is NOT a traditional Greek dish - It derives from Cyprus and the Middle East. Please regard as a tourist dish.
* Chickpeas in the traditional Greek cuisine (at least in Attica &amp; Cyclades) are usually eaten only as soup.

These objectives are up to date for the 2009 edition of the CompTIA Network+ exam.

The Network+ certification ensures that the successful candidate has the important knowledge and skills necessary to manage, maintain, troubleshoot, install, operate and configure basic network infrastructure, describe networking technologies, basic design principles, and adhere to wiring standards and use testing tools.

The skills and knowledge measured by this examination were derived from an industry-wide job task analysis and validated through an industry-wide global survey in Q2 2008. The results of this survey were used in weighing the domains and ensuring that the weighting is representative of the relative importance of the content.

The table to the right lists the domains measured by this examination and the extent to which they are represented. Network+ exams are based on these objectives.

''Note: The bulleted lists below each objective are not exhaustive lists. Even though they are not included in this document, other examples of technologies, processes, or tasks pertaining to each objective may also be included on the exam.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Integration, is the process of anti-differention. In the last segment we saw that differentiating a function gives the gradient (or rate of change) of that function. Integrating a function, on the other hand, gives the area underneath the curve of that function.

==Basic integration==
Integration is the reverse of differentiation.

===Notation===
The integral sign is &lt;math&gt;\int f \left (x \right ) dx&lt;/math&gt;. This symbol was chosen by Leibniz because it looks like an elongated S and an integral is a limit of sums. The f(x) is known as the ''integrand''. The dx means that we integrate with respect to x.

===Integration Rules===
An arbitrary constant must be created every time a function is integrated. This is because when a constant is differentiated it becomes zero, so there is no way of telling if such a constant used to exist.

&lt;math&gt;\int x^n\, dx = \frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + C,\ (n \ne -1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int kx^n\, dx = k \int x^n\, dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int \left\{ f^'(x) + g^'(x)\right\}\, dx = f(x) + g(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int \left\{ f^'(x) - g^'(x)\right\}\, dx = f(x) - g(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;

====Examples====
&lt;math&gt;\int x^3 =  \frac{1}{3+1} x^{3+1} + c = \frac{1}{4} x^{4} + c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int 4x^3 = 4 \int x^3 = 4 \left ( \frac{1}{3+1} x^{3+1} \right ) + c = 4 \left ( \frac{1}{4} x^{4} \right ) + c = x^4 + c&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int x^4 - 3x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 3 = \int x^4 - \int 3x^3 + \int 4x^2 - \int x + \int 3 = \frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{3}{4} x^4 + \frac{4}{3} x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x + c&lt;/math&gt;

===Fundamental Theorem of Calculus===
This is the most important rule in calculus it establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. Here is the theorem:
Let f be continuous on [a,b].
#If &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f \left ( t \right )\ dt&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g' \left ( x \right ) = f \left ( x \right )&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = F \left ( b \right ) - F \left ( a \right )&lt;/math&gt;, F is the antiderivative of f such that F' = f
The first rule states that if we integrate a function and then we differentiate the resultant then we will arrive at the same function. The second part says that we can find a definite integral by subtracting the value of F at the endpoints.

==Indefinite Integrals==
The first part of the Fundamental theorem of calculus establishes that if we differentiate a function and then integrate a function we get a indefinite integral. When we evaluate an indefinite integral the resultant will be a function. For an indefinite integral we use the appropriate rule to get the general antiderivative. If a point on the graph is given we solve for C, to get the complete antiderivative.

===Example===
The rate of a function is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;4x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 2&lt;/math&gt;, the point (0, -7) is on the curve. Find the equation of the curve.&lt;p&gt;
#We need to find the general indefinite integral of &lt;math&gt;4x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int (4x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 2)dx = x^4 + x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + C&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we substitute the point (0, -7) into the general antiderivative to get the value of C.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;-7 = \left ( 0 \right )^4 + \left ( 0 \right )^3 - 2 \left ( 0 \right )^2 + 2 \left ( 0 \right ) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;C = -7&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we can write the complete antiderivative.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F \left ( x \right ) = x^4 + x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x - 7&lt;/math&gt;

==Definite Integrals==
The definite integral is used to find the area underneath a curve. The second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus allows to evaluate these integrals, the resultant will be a number. The Definite Integral is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f \left ( x \right )\, dx&lt;/math&gt;. In the definite integral a is the ''lower limit''  and b is the ''upper limit'' together they are known as the ''limits of integration''. The limits of integration on which interval to find the area. When we evaluate a definite integral we don't write the +c because they will always cancel out and are liable to cause confusion. When we write &lt;math&gt;F(x)\Big]_{a}^{b}&lt;/math&gt; this means that we have found the indefinite integral and are going to find the definite integral from b to a.

===Rules of Definite Integrals===
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = F \left ( b \right ) - F \left ( a \right )&lt;/math&gt;, F is the antiderivative of f such that F' = f
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = - \int_{b}^{a} f \left ( x \right )\ dx&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{a} f \left ( x \right )\ dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;
#Area between a curve and the x-axis is &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} y\, dx\ ( \mbox{for}\ y \ge 0)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
#Area between a curve and the y-axis is &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} x\, dy\ ( \mbox{for}\ x \ge 0)&lt;/math&gt;

===Area of a Region Bounded By A Curve===
When we evaluate area underneath curve we need to make sure that the interval over which we are finding the area is not in part or in full below the x-axis. In order to determine this fact we need to find x-intercepts of the function. Then we see if a x-intercept is in the interval. If so we need to determine which part of the interval is below the x-axis. If the whole interval is below the x-axis we take the absolute value of the area &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} \begin{vmatrix} f \left ( x \right )\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt; .If only part of the interval is under the x-axis we need to break up the integration function into positive and negative parts. For the negative parts we need take the absolute value of the area. For example: If we need to find the area of &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b}&lt;/math&gt; and on the interval's &lt;math&gt;a,a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_1,b&lt;/math&gt; the curve is above the x-axis and on the interval &lt;math&gt;a_1,b_1&lt;/math&gt; the curve is below the x-axis, we would break the integral into these parts: &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{a_1} f \left ( x \right ) dx + \int_{a_1}^{b_1} \begin{vmatrix} f \left ( x \right )\end{vmatrix} dx + \int_{b_1}^{b} f \left ( x \right )dx&lt;/math&gt;. If you are unable to evaluate the definite integral you will need to use a [[A-level_Mathematics/C3/Numerical_Methods|numerical method]] to estimate the area.

====Example====
Evaluate &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{3} x^3 - 6x\ dx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
#First we need to find the x-intercepts. In this case they will be at 0 and 2.
#Then we determine where x is positive or negative on the interval.&lt;p&gt; 0__f(1)=-5__2__f(3)=9.
#Now we break the integral into parts. &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{2} \begin{vmatrix} x^3 - 6x \end{vmatrix}\ dx + \int_{2}^{3} x^3 - 6x\ dx&lt;/math&gt;.
#Now we evaluate the two definite integrals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (  \left ( \frac{1}{4} \left ( 3 \right )^4 - 3 \left ( 3 \right )^2 \right ) - \left ( \frac{1}{4} \left ( 2 \right )^4 - 3 \left ( 2 \right )^2 \right )  \right )&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\left ( \begin{vmatrix} \left ( \frac{1}{4} \left ( 2 \right )^4 - 3 \left ( 2 \right )^2 \right ) - \left ( \frac{1}{4} \left ( 0 \right )^4 - 3 \left ( 0 \right )^2 \right ) \end{vmatrix} \right )&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left ( -6.75 - - 8 \right )&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\left ( \begin{vmatrix} -8 - 0 \end{vmatrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt; = 9.25
# The area under the curve of &lt;math&gt;x^3 -6x&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 3 is 9.25.

==Areas Involving Two Curves==

===Area Bounded By Two Curves===
In order to calculate the area bounded curves we need to:
# Find the places where the 2 curves intercept. &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = g\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The lower point of intersection will become the lower limit and the upper point of intersection will become the upper limit of integration.
# Decide whether to integrate with respect to x or y. This is easy to do in most cases, see if the function is more easily integrated as y = f(x) or x = f(y).
# Determine which curve is above the other curve. 
# Subtract the bottom curve from the top curve. &lt;math&gt;A = \int_{a}^{b}\begin{vmatrix} f\left(x\right) - g\left(x\right) \end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;
# Evaluate the definite integral

====Example====
Find the area bounded by &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;.
#&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 3x - 3 = x\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(x + 3\right)\left(x - 1\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = -3\ or\ 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
#We will integrate with respect to x because the equation is in the form f(x).
#We now have to determine which line is above the other. For this we just test a point. I will use f(x) = 0&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = 0^2 + 3\times0 - 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;y = - 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt; will be above &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt;.
#Now we write out the integral.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-3}^{1} \begin{vmatrix} \left(x\right) - \left(x^2 + 3x - 3\right) \end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-3}^{1}\begin{vmatrix}-x^2 - 2x + 3\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;
#Finally we evaluate the definite integral.
:&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} -\frac{1}{3}x^3 - x^2 + 3x\end{vmatrix}\Big]_{-3}^{1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{3}\left(1\right)^3 - \left(1\right)^2 + 3\left(1\right)\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}-\frac{1}{3}\left(-3\right)^3 - \left(-3\right)^2 + 3\left(-3\right)\end{bmatrix}\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} 1\frac{2}{3}- (-9) \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;Area = 10\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

===Area Between Two Curves===
When we calculate the area between two curves the procedure is very similar as to when we calculate the area bounded by two curves. In the problem the limits of integration will be given. The major difference is that in some cases we need to split the integral up.
# Find the places where the 2 curves intercept. &lt;math&gt;f\left(x\right) = g\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
# If the two graphs intercept at a point within the limit of integration, we will need to split the integral into parts. We will use the points of interception as break points.
# Decide whether to integrate with respect to x or y. This is easy to do in most cases, see if the function is more easily integrated as y = f(x) or x = f(y).
# Determine which curve is above the other curve. If the integral has been split up do this on every interval. 
# Subtract the top curve from the bottom curve.&lt;math&gt;A = \int_{a}^{b}\begin{vmatrix} f\left(x\right) - g\left(x\right) \end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;. If the integral has been split up we add up the parts.
# Evaluate the definite integral(s).

====Example====
Find the area between by &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt; between x = -4 and x = 4.
#&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 3x - 3 = x\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left(x + 3\right)\left(x - 1\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = -3\ or\ 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
# Since the graph have points of interception on the interval we need to split the integral into parts. The parts will be (-4, -3), (-3, 1), and (1,4)
#We will integrate with respect to x because the equation is in the form f(x).
#We now have to determine which line is above the other on each interval. For this we just test a point on each interval.&lt;p&gt; For the line &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt; __f(-4)=-4__f(-2)=-2___f(3)=3__.&lt;p&gt; For the curve &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt; __f(-4)=-1__f(-2)=-5___f(3)=15__.&lt;p&gt; Now we will know that on the interval (-4, -3) &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt; is above &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;, (-3, 1) &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt; is above &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt;, and (1,4) &lt;math&gt;y = x^2 + 3x - 3&lt;/math&gt; is above &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;.
#Now we write out the integral.&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-4}^{-3}\begin{vmatrix} \left(x^2 + 3x - 3\right) - \left(x\right)\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\int_{-3}^{1}\begin{vmatrix} \left(x\right) - \left(x^2 + 3x - 3\right) \end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;+ &lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{4}\begin{vmatrix} \left(x^2 + 3x - 3\right) - \left(x\right)\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-4}^{-3}\begin{vmatrix} \left(x^2 + 2x - 3\right)\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\int_{-3}^{1}\begin{vmatrix}-x^2 - 2x -3\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{4}\begin{vmatrix} \left(x^2 + 2x - 3\right)\end{vmatrix} dx&lt;/math&gt;
# Now we evaluate the definite integrals.&lt;p&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}\frac{1}{3}x^3 + x^2 -3x\end{vmatrix}\Big]_{-4}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} -\frac{1}{3}x^3 - x^2 + 3x\end{vmatrix}\Big]_{-3}^{1} &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}\frac{1}{3}x^3 + x^2 -3x\end{vmatrix}\Big]_{1}^{4}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}-9 - \frac{-76}{3}\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; +  &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}\frac{2}{3}- 18 \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} \frac{76}{3} -  \frac{-5}{3}\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;Area = 60 \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

==Estimating Area Underneath A Curve==
It becomes necessary to estimate the area underneath a curve when a function is very difficult or impossible to integrate or when we obtain our curve from a set of values. 

===Trapezium Rule===
The Trapezium Rule estimates the area under a curve between limits by turning the curve into a set of trapeziums (or strips) and each strip is made out of two ordinates, so there is always one more ordinates than there are strips. The formulae is:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b y \,dx \approx \frac{1}{2} h \left \{\left (y_0 + y_n \right )  + 2\left (y_1 + y_2 + \ldots + y_{n-1} \right ) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Where: &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{b-a}{n}&lt;/math&gt;


====Example====
Use the Trapezium Rule to evaluate &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1}(2x + 1)^1/2\ dx&lt;/math&gt; using 4 strips.&lt;p&gt;
Firstly, we work out h.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{1-0}{4} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we start setting up the Trapezium Rule.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1}(2x + 1)^1/2\ dx \approx \frac{1}{8} \left [f \left (0 \right )+ f \left (1 \right ) + 2\left \{ f \left (0.25 \right ) + f \left (0.5 \right ) + f \left (0.75 \right )\right \}  \right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Solving for the f(n) we get:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1}(2x+1)^1/2\ dx \approx \frac{1}{8} \left [1 + 1.73 + 2\left \{ 1.22 + 1.41 + 1.42\right \}  \right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1}(2x+1)^1/2\ dx \approx\ 1.39375&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

==Integrals to Infinity==
An integral that has either it upper limit going to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; or is lower limit going to &lt;math&gt;- \infty&lt;/math&gt; is an improper integral and cannot be computed directly instead we need to find the limit of the function. The improper integrals &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infty} f\left(x\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{b} f\left(x\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt; is convergent if the limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist. The rules to calculate a integral going to infinity are:&lt;p&gt;
1) If &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infty} f\left(n\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt; exist for all number &lt;math&gt;n \ge a&lt;/math&gt;, then 
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infty} f\left(x\right)\ dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{a}^{\infty} f\left(x\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt; The limit has to be a finite number.
2) If &lt;math&gt;\int_{n}^{b} f\left(x\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt; exist for all number &lt;math&gt;n \le b&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{b} f\left(x\right)\ dx = \lim_{n \to - \infty}\int_{-\infty}^{b} f\left(x\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt; The limit has to be a finite number.
3) If &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infty} f\left(n\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_{n}^{b} f\left(x\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt; are convergent, then
: &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f\left(n\right)\ dx = \int_{n}^{a} f\left(x\right)\ dx + \int_{a}^{\infty} f\left(n\right)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt; a is any real number.

== Overview ==

'''''Centaurs''''' are magical creatures with the upper body of a man and the lower body of a horse.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Centaurs are a noble race that greatly values astrology and Divination. They like to keep to themselves, and think that it is beneath them to do a wizard's bidding. There is a large herd of centaurs that lives in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. They are excellent archers. Notable Centaurs include [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bane|Bane]]; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Magorian|Magorian]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ronan|Ronan]] are also mentioned.

Centaurs do not like to associate with humans, but they &quot;do not harm foals&quot; (meaning children and teenagers). They also do not like being underestimated or thought of as creatures. They attack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] after she calls them &quot;filthy-half breeds&quot; and states they have &quot;near-human intelligence.&quot; They also get extremely angry at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] for letting on that she and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] had purposefully led Umbridge into the forest so the Centaurs could &quot;take care of her for them.&quot;

== Analysis ==

Centaurs see themselves as more intelligent and more aware of the world and the Universe than humans; this is why the more excitable among them, notably Bane, get so angry when their intelligence is impugned by &quot;mere Humans&quot;. Firenze is expelled from the herd because he chooses to work for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], as the majority of the herd feel that this makes him subservient to a human.

'''Upma''' or '''Uppittu''' as it is referred to in Karnataka is a wholesome [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] dish made of Rava (Cream of Wheat). There are many ways it is prepared but typically includes a healthy amount of vegetables added during preparation. The Rava used for this must be the large-grained, as Upma prepared with fine Rava tends to become soggy.

== Ingredients: ==

*One cup upma rava (common in India and also found in Indian stores in other countries)
*One medium sized onion, finely chopped (more onions may also be added to give extra flavour)
*One medium sized tomato, chopped
*4 to 5 finely chopped green chilli peppers
*1 tsp ginger, finely chopped
*1 tsp garlic, finely chopped
*1 tsp mustard seeds
*4 tbsp. oil
*Salt (to taste)
*1 tbsp. lemon juice
*Two cups water
*Note: You can add other vegetables like potato, Zucchini, Mushroom, peas, beans etc. to suit your taste

== Procedure: ==

#In a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] or other suitable utensil heat 1 TBS of oil. When the oil is hot add the Rava in and stir it with a spoon until the Rava starts browning. The main purpose of this is to coat the rava grains with the oil so that they don’t stick. Be sure not to burn the Rava or you will have to restart. Keep the Rava aside and let it cool.
#In the same Wok or another suitable utensil heat the remaining oil. When hot add the Mustard seeds and wait until the seeds start crackling. When the crackling starts tapering off add the onions and fry until golden brown. Then add the ginger and the garlic and stir for a few seconds. Add the remaining vegetables and the water. Add enough salt such that when tasted it is slightly saltier than required. Turn the heat to medium and let it simmer until the vegetables are cooked but still crispy. 
#At this time turn the heat to low and start adding the Rava to the water. This is the most important step that determines the correct consistency of the Upma. The Rava must be added as quickly as possible while continuously stirring the contents ensuring no lumps are formed. When the Rava is thoroughly mixed cover the vessel and let it cook for a few minutes, stirring the contends every 20 seconds or so. 
#Turn the heat off and add the lemon juice and mix it well.
#Upma is known to be eaten with a variety of sides like Chutney, Sugar, Pickles etc.

:Dunno. Lets find out. Maybe I should have put my original message here. I have been neglecting wikibooks in favor of other projects. I have been neglecting wikiversity because it seemed like it would never be a project. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 13:31, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

:I'm still not sure why there is [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Wikiversity|an effort to remove the wikiversity pages from wikibooks]]. Maybe the long-standing failure to start a wikiversity and the sudden effort to remove wikiversity is driven by people who own stock in some other online university. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 16:34, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

== Re: Professors and other nonsense with Wikiversity ==

I'm not sure if you have had a chance to see this page on Meta that was about a conference in South Africa that Anthere attended as an official representative of the Wikimedia Foundation:  [[meta:Conference reports/FLOSS, South Africa 2005/Workshop 2]]

That is a huge eye opener in terms of what the Foundation board may be thinking in terms of Wikiversity, and it is just one more example that if you ask an average Wikimedia user what exactly Wikiversity means to them, you would probably get a different answer from each and every person you would ask that question to.  I have seen so many different responses both from supporters and detractors of Wikiversity that sometimes I even wonder if they are talking about the same project proposal.  I would try to graph out the various philosophies to compare one person's vision about Wikiversity to another, but I can come up with at least six different axis of future directions for Wikiversity, including potential for accrediation, relationship between professors and students, original research, teaching actual classes, development of educational resources, and wheither it should even be a Wikimedia project at all.  Even more interesting is that most people don't have strong opinions on any of these topics, but tend to muddle in the middle about each of these potentials although there are strong champions for each end of these philosophies, for example those that absolutely don't want a heirarchy and those that do, or those that feel Wikiversity is about an on-line learning experience (actual classes) and those that think it should only be in essence a one stop shopping center for textbooks and classroom visual aides.  There are some people with general leanings in one direction or another, however, but I havn't found any consistant correlation between the various schools of thought.  Supporters of original research, for example, have divirgant opinions on all of the other issues.

The important thing to note is that none of this has really been resolved in any direction, although there are sometimes strong opinions on the subject.  Wikiversity is evolving even now, and I think this tension between traditional educational model thinking and those that are used to peer-related activities that are natural to Wikis will be almost an ever-present feature of Wikiverity for as long as it exists.  If some group gets in and forces &quot;policy&quot; one way or another, there will still remain those who insist at going the other way.  For myself, I tend to agree with you in terms of keeping the peer relationships going on Wikiversity, being one friend offering some new knowledge to another friend.  Getting all huffed up over maintaining mideval relationships imposed during feudal monarchial governments can seem downright silly in a modern world, but you must keep in mind that this is a point-of-view as well.

What Wikiversity needs now is simply some leadership.  I am also appalled that the indecisiveness of the Wikimedia Foundation board regarding new projects.  They aren't saying &quot;No&quot;, but neither are they saying &quot;Yes&quot;.  It shouldn't be that hard of a decision to make, and I don't even see a statement like &quot;we want to review all of the discussion on the subject, and it is simply going to take some time to digest everybody's thoughts&quot;.  Instead I see an odd disconnect between the Wikimedia Foundation board's view of Wikiversity and what the participants think it is or ought to be.  

BTW, in terms of [[User:Gh0st]] deleting things from his own talk page, I don't see anything specifically wrong with that practice.  He got the message, and doesn't want to be reminded that other people have different opinions on the subject.  That is a reflection of his tolerance toward differing opinions (and unfortunately typical of most university professors from my experience).  You should use that to judge his potential as an instructor as well.  I do appreciate that some people like him are trying to organize some actual classes that will be taught through Wikiversity, as I think there needs to be some demonstration classes to convince the board that this is a real possibility.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:28, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

:Well, thank you for such a lengthy response! There's loads here but I'll try to answer your points one by one.
*On Anthere's presentation: Yes, I was in contact with her while she was preparing that presentation - but she made no secret of the fact that she herself was quite confused by what Wikiversity was. I don't think this represents the board's view per se, but rather reflects her own research on the various ideas of what Wikiversity could be. Note that the other attendees at the conference thought the ''e-learning'' model was unworkable, but preferred the ''repository'' idea instead. I think this has certainly influenced her thinking since then. But you can see that it represents a clear interest in the project. And on the board's &quot;indecisiveness&quot; - this is ''exactly'' why I have been asked to join the [[m:Special projects committee]], and your idea for what the board should be saying/asking is ''exactly'' what is being asked of me/us :-) I don't know if you've appreciated the importance of that fact so far - that this committee ''will'' set up Wikiversity, soon, with the support of the people, like yourself, who have been putting in the work so far. I've taken on the &quot;leadership&quot; challenge, but I really hope to count you in on this process..
*On policy or the project's identity: Well, this is where all the misunderstanding and circular arguments have been coming from. But, in my mind at least, the confusing range of ideas about Wikiversity can all be resolved with the &quot;repository-of-resources and learning-community&quot; model. This is one where people develop resources together, just like on any other Wikimedia project, and then ''use'' them to discuss, problematise, research, ''learn''. This is peer-learning in action. But, and this is the crucial point, it doesn't have to be just between peers, or &quot;friends&quot;, as you say - it can just as easily work as a dialogue between a teacher and student, with questions like, &quot;why do you think this is so?&quot;, &quot;have you thought about..?&quot;. I think that the community model involves people who want to teach, ie help other people learn - but it can't involve other people who are inflexible enough to relinquish control of 'their course'. In short, Wikiversity can support ''leadership'' (just like any community), but not ''ownership''. This is why I think [[User:Gh0st]]'s attitude is so unsustainable - he's free to develop materials and then use them but not to use Wikiversity as a platform. And as for his blanking of questions from me and another user, well, I think that's a terrible precedent to set (especially for a self-appointed &quot;leader&quot;); it is a clear violation of etiquette, and even though not mentioned on [[Wikibooks:Etiquette]] or [[w:Wikipedia:Etiquette]], I definitely think it should be. In fact, I'm going to take this up on the mailing list, probably foundation-l. &lt;br&gt;Well, I think in a rambling sort of way, that addressed most points you made. I think, overall, we need to work on creating a sustainable vision for Wikiversity that will continue to attract and include people from all backgrounds. If this disappoints some people who want to bolster their ego by calling themselves a &quot;professor&quot;, so be it. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 14:19, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
**In reply to this, I fail to see what the real difficulty is to simply &quot;turning on&quot; http://en.wikiversity.org/ at the moment?  The debate by the Foundation board should be if we can secure the domain (it has been done and is owned by the Wikimedia Foundation), and if there is going to be a viable community to keep it sustained.  I can understand some need to clarify what the &quot;founding&quot; policies are going to be, but that work has been done, nor were there any real suggestions or guidelines as to what those policies should be.  I can appreciate the P.R. angle that the board members are working with, but it really isn't that hard to do.  It certainly wasn't that hard to create http://de.wikiversity.org/, nor has there been even a mention that it was created improperly by any board member.
**As far as the Special Project Committee is concerned:  I am not at all pleased with the way it was put together, even though I would have to admit that if I was given the choice to hand select the members of such a group that I would likly have chosen most of the same people.  The insular procedure of accepting new members into that group is going to ultimately be its downfall, as there is no mechanism to bring in people with substantially different points of view.  I'll reserve ultimate judgement and I'm trying to keep a relatively low profile over the group, but all I consider the Special Projects Committee to be is simply a bunch of Wikimedia users who got together to help get a few things rolling.  It certainly doesn't represent the Wikimedia community, nor should it ever.  Board members who treat anything developed by that group should give it the same credibility as any other ad-hoc committee formed by any other group of Wikimedia users.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:02, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

:::(I moved your comment here to aid reply.) Wikiversity.de was created without the consent of the board - what we've been trying to do since (as you know) is to get board approval for Wikiversity. It certainly won't be hard to &quot;turn on&quot; Wikiversity - that's never been the issue - the issue is the scope etc of the project, and whether that's workable and sustainable. The &quot;PR angle&quot; shouldn't really be an issue either - although we don't want (as Angela once pointed out) people turning away because their hopes of getting a free education are not fulfilled - is that what you meant here?

:::The special projects committee was set up, ''by the board'', to set up or facilitate new projects, to interface with other organisations, and to coordinate research efforts (amongst other things), and as such, it represents the organisation of Wikimedia, rather than the community, per se. But we want to be as open to the community as possible, and we're trying to make clear what our procedures are so any individual or group can bring their ideas to fruition. We're also making our policy on how we accept new members, and believe me, we ''will'' be accepting new members. However, the bulk of the work will actually be done through subcommittees, focussed on individual tasks. One of these subcommittees will be on Wikiversity - I am spearheading this. These subcommittees make their own rules of procedure, but are ultimately answerable to the main SP committee. Some will be more closed - others will be more open. I'm hoping to make this as open and as accepting of people of &quot;substantially different points of view&quot; as possible - but, most importantly, I'm trying to put together a good, practical, exciting and inviting proposal, probably containing evidence of how it will work, and possibly some indication of its policy framework. This is what the Special projects committee and the board ultimately want. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 22:35, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

::::Thank you for being involved at least with this group.  Time will tell how truly open it is, and I do have my doubts.  Jimbo himself has been critical of some of the opinions I've expressed over the subject of new project creation, but experience has almost vindicated what I've said about the creation of new wikis (aka seperate projects) with the Wikimedia Foundation.  de.wikiversity was announced to Foundation-l within days of its creation, and IMHO it should have been shut down immediately for no other reason than precedence.  It wasn't, and neither was the action condemned by the board (which could have been done in a civil tone as well).  Oh well, I guess you can tell by my tone that I do have strong opinions here.  I think Wikiversity could be started with a strong &quot;disclaimer&quot; on the front page that Wikiversity is still being established.  The big problem I see at the moment is that content is being added to Wikibooks that admins here on Wikibooks are very reluctant to delete because of its association with Wikiversity.  Some Wikiversity content has been put up for a VfD, but I've especially been relutant to even question some of the content.  Original research is explictly prohibited, and that has been the main thing that was removed, including the whole mess with the Wikimania proceedings that resulted in a deletion war between myself, Kernigh, and Brion Vibber.  And you thought edit wars could be nasty?  I do wish the Wikimania participants would have used a connection to Wikiversity as justification for keeping it on Wikibooks, but they didn't.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:03, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:::::Likewise, thanks for your continued dedication to the Wikiversity dream (even keeping material on Wikibooks, when it should be deleted). On wikiversity.de, I think there was confusion all round at the time, but things have moved on since then. Wikimedia is now (as you know) getting its house in order with regards to the full process by which work is done and decisions are made etc, and these committees are meant to be addressing that. But I digress. And on the Wikimania proceedings transwiki, I have to say that I had no idea it was happening until after the event (your post to [[m:Talk:Wikiversity#Wikimania_and_conference_proceedings_on_Wikiversity|Meta]] I think it was that alerted me). I certainly would have chimed in if I had known.. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 13:19, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

== [[m:Wikikernel|Wikikernel]] and a seed Wiki ==

While I'm pestering you, I might as well note that I've started a new project proposal on Meta that is essentially restarting one that you have done earlier.  I have linked to your earlier effort, and now I'm just trying to solicit comments and trying to overcome objections that were raised earlier by Angela and Anthere.

Any comments or even assistance in trying to get this proposal going would be significantly appreciated.  This is just another attempt to '''Be Bold''' and to try and get something going where IMHO there is a real need.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:05, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

This sounds like Wiki project incubator or thinktank type project. How does it differ from the &quot;Special Projects&quot; committee? Was just wondering...--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 15:18, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Mike. Robert's talking about an idea to have a wiki for hosting projects that have participants but don't yet have an official home or recognised status. The [[m:Special projects committee]] is (amongst other things) about giving projects that status. I don't really see how this idea is different from [[m:Seed wiki]], but in any case, I think it would be good to get something like this going - it might make it easier for the Special projects committee to see which projects would work and which wouldn't. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 17:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)


== Jesus, Cormaggio! ==  

::I have to make some comments here, because whilst there are some correct assessment, there is ALSO a lot of bullshit. Maybe may I also clarify some questions.  [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] 06:53, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

I realize that you are under thirty, a rising star with an education in education, and now selected by the Wikimedia Foundation power structure as their special representative less disliked than any other incorrigables at Wikiversity.  Personally, I did not care for the syllabus or outlined approaches of Gh0st's Poly Sci classes or apparent leadership style but would it be so difficult to simply advise him/her to title his activity a series of seminars and leave them alone to prototype some online learning?  If the newcomer [[user:Wikizach]] takes me up on prototyping some poly sci classes then the student body will have some options in at least one learning area at Wikiversity.  

::No. Cormac is not a &quot;selected representative&quot;. The current situation is &quot;some editors made a proposal to start wikiversity. It was presented to the board, to see if the Foundation would support the project (ie, pay for the servers maintaining the project, pay for the bandwidth etc...). The board thinks that the project as proposed may not be suitable. And as a result, the project is stuck. And the board does not have time to push for modifications that might be suitable. The sp committee is there to have things done that the board is clearly not able to do itself. By lack of time, interest, or whatever. Cormac, as an interested party, will, hopefully, make it so that the project gets alive. That does not mean he leads the project. Nor that he will take the decision to start it or not. Rather see him as an interface.

Meanwhile I have found nothing promised at meta regarding submitting the proposal and getting our permanent URLs active.  Get your paperwork done and leave the harassing of other participants to us other mere participants.  How are you going to play mediator or leader when you are defining yourself as one side of the newly arising disputes that the Wikimedia Foundation has suckered you into taking on?  Do yourself a favor.  Go find out if Roberth or Maveric149 (former leaders in charge of proposal of Wikiversity now going on three years slow rolling by Board) and find out if they have hard feelings towards you being picked to take credit for leading their project into the promised land.  In fact, go consult JWSurf and MFinney regarding office politics in private.  Notice both of them are experienced managers and instructors.  Try not to threaten them with spurious charges of incivility or your new found status as the selected minion of the stacked Board's selected committee. 
::I think I do not belong to the &quot;stack&quot; stuff. The board approved three people to start this committee, Danny, Jakob and myself). These three people chose the current committee members. And definitly chose Cormac. Not the board. This will be the same for any future member. The committee will choose them; Not the board. Roberth is actually on the subcommittee if I understood well. Mav could be if interested naturally. When the subcommittee is formed, any member on it may be chosen as the &quot;chair&quot; (which might be understood as the &quot;leader&quot;). Or no one if you think it best. Cormac is not the leader of it. He is what the group will accept him to be.

Get our URLs active and turn on the web traffic.  If five or fifty fullblooded P'hd Engineers, PE show up to give real courses with official syllabus, exercises, lectures, etc. etc. or retired NASA people grumpy at never getting to design an actual useful spacecraft or technology you do not want to be marginalized as the idiot trying to enforce uninformed Board mandates all by your lonesome.  In case you missed it Wikiversity is an experiment.  Nobody really knows what is going to work.   We need to try some things and find out.  The Board has painted themselves into some corners with their premature announcements and promises regarding &quot;freeing the curriculum&quot;
::I must be very firm here. It is unnice to say &quot;the board has said&quot; when only Jimbo said something. Please, respect that each board member is an individual, with a past, an experience and opinion on his/her own. Thanks

and some other idiocies aimed at separating the fiscal entity from the &quot;community&quot; in pursuit of cash donations they control.  When the dust settles do you want to be the villian scapegoated and outcast by the &quot;community&quot; of instructors, students, and participants who inevitably choose to do as they please rather than as the Board mandates for the Board's convenience or financial interests?  Keep in mind Wikiversity is slowly getting started in spite of mismanagement of the Board.  If the permanent URLs are not forthcoming soon how long do you suppose it will be ... nevermind.  That argument was old a year ago and the lack of available public student wikis still mystifies me.
::The problem is that you may start the project on your own, and hide it in one of Wikimedia project. But if it is not recognised as valid, one day or another, it might just be entirely erased. So, it might be a better idea to have it approved, so that it has the right on its own to be there... or move it to another hosting provider.

Please consider writing a paragraph submission memo for the modified proposal and request some of the regulars show up and express support and state personal exceptions.  I personally will rewrite and repropose the alternative &lt;b&gt;Wikiversity is Not&lt;/b&gt; section:

Wikiversity is not a place to tell others what they cannot do or try.  Productive forking is encouraged, may the best learning community grow faster than its alternatives.

:Hi lazyquasar, I'm responding here, because it's easier to refer to what you're saying.

:There are things that I agree with here, things I disagree with strongly, and things I simply don't understand. I agree that i may have come across too strongly in addressing [[User:Gh0st]] initially - but you have to realise the context of that. Did you look at, for example, the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Pos_1000&amp;action=history history page of the class] or [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:School_of_Political_Science&amp;action=history the school], or his [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gh0st&amp;action=history deletion] of subsequent queries of his actions? I thought that Buridan's question and point of view was a valid one and saw Gh0st's actions as, basically, bullying. However, I realise he had only joined wikibooks, and I was possibly too strong in my initial comment, and I don't feel so great about that.

:On the work of getting Wikiversity set up, this is ongoing at [[m:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal]], and details of the subcommittee we were talking about are at [[m:Wikiversity subcommittee]]. We're currently trying to figure out where we will actually get that paperwork done and how. This is a collaborative process, as always - it's not solely my responsibility - though I will put everything into seeing that it does get done, and well. 

:&quot;selected minion of the stacked Board's selected committee&quot; - this is just ridiculous. I'm still a participant of Wikiversity - I've been asked on to the SPC for various interests of mine, and I proposed the Wikiversity subcommittee, but that doesn't mean that I am its self appointed leader. When I said &quot;spearheading&quot; to Gh0st, I meant to just highlight the context of this to him, and that I will be playing an active role in this, as I am motivated to getting Wikiversity set up - just as you are, and just as Robert and Mav are. I'll be representing the subcommittee to the SPC, but I'm still involved in the project and its proposal and activities. So, of course I will give my opinion on anything I have an opinion on - how can you suggest that i just busy myself with the bureaucracy? And as for the &quot;selected committee&quot; of the &quot;stacked board&quot;, well, it just betrays a complete misunderstanding.

:What wikiversity is not - I fully agree that we need to allow Wikiversity to be an experimental place. But I still think we need to make broad recommendations about what is likely to work and what is not. I don't think this should at all be an imposition - I was thinking that ''working in a collaborative environment'' needs to be respected, so allowing for ownership of courses is potentially divisive. However, i do agree that some forking will happen - different people will have different methods. '''But''': we still need to figure out how to deal with the board's directive to &quot;exclude online courses&quot; - I wouldn't call this mismanagement, but I do think it could have been explained better.

:I haven't a clue what you mean about the board's financial interests or the other &quot;idiocies&quot; you mention - can you please start making sense and trying to work with me and others (including the board), rather than take this combative stance all the time? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 12:54, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

::The bane of science and productivity is people who have no idea about what will actually work in the field attempting to &quot;lead&quot; others by dictating what others can or can not do.  Personally I think we can productively discuss &quot;broad recommendations&quot; as long as we do not drift into &quot; ... as a designated representative of the Board's selected committe I am here to relay their a priori commandments to you so listen well or else dire consequences shall follow ...&quot;

::Regarding ownership.  Wikiversity is not Wikipedia.  There can be more than one page per topic or student interest.  If ownership offends you then merely move on to an unowned or differently owned page or start and own or disown your own.  The self evolving and regulating web traffic will dynamically sort people, interests, and material appropriately when the site has established itself with thousands of diverse regular users.

::Regarding stacked board.  Run a search of the wikipedia-l mailing list for the first two or three years for foundation or non-profit.  You may find it illuminating.  I would suggest you do so before publishing any further academic work on &quot;Democracy&quot; within the Wikipedia community.  The actual label and lynch process early on resembled selective genocide or evolution more than &quot;democracy&quot;.  Perhaps this has evolved in recent years.  Since I restrict my participation at Wikipedia to correcting obvious factual errors or adding citations, often anonymously, I am not really familiar with the &quot;community&quot; practices for the last year or two.  As a designated troll for the early temerity to ask some specific questions regarding business organization, long term plans, licensing issues, financial plans and attempting mediation in implementation of actual written policy vs. the prejudices, opinions, and personal desires of the &quot;leadership&quot; I got a pretty good bird's eye view of the prevailing &quot;leadership&quot; as practiced at early Wikipedia by project founders and Bomis employee's.  

::Collaboration does not mean everyone snaps to at the whim of a designated leader.  To many people it means productive cooperation as in a barn raising.  People helping with things they know how to do or are interested in learning about.  

::Idiocy.  Announcing to the world at large via a public conference the wonders of the Wiki Way and its potential in &quot;freeing the curriculum&quot; (presumably from the clutches of publishers and government regulators and economic pressures) and bridging the digital divide only to return to the wiki communities locally attempting to experiment with the technology on a public wiki funded by public donations to a non profit corporation and deny them stable URLs in favor of diverting traffic to a personally owned commercial wiki site could probably be termed many things: incompetence, criminal, shady, selfish, foolish, divisive, etc.   I prefer the broad category of &quot;idiocy&quot;.  Notice that of five board members only two have publicly acknowledged interests in Wikia.  Why are the other three aquiescing in this foolishness?  Possibly because the Board is stacked (selected by Jimbo for his personal reasons as stated as intent on the public mailing lists) to go along with &quot;Jimmy says ...&quot; as the local &quot;leadership&quot;s governing ontological distinction?  If you dislike the term idiocy then you are welcome to call it what you please: genious of the Board, policy mandate from the community leadership, detailed policy established by consensus of survivors on surviving wiki pages, etc. etc.
::This is public information, Jimbo is as of today the chair of Wikia. Angela is its vice-chair. Michael is the treasurer as I understood. And Tim is also working in Wikia. I am the only independant one. So, generally, I agree with your statement. This relation with Wikia may have two consequences. First, Wikia benefits from Wikipedia's popularity (it definitly does. Jimbo mentions Wikia each time he can; including in his permanent signature. And divert business that can not go in WMF). Finances are still a bit shared or were still shared until recently (office for example). Second, 3 board members are in effect Jimbo's employees, thus casting doubts on their voting directions. Practically speaking, I believe Michael though, is making a lot of effort to separate both entities and has shown a good level of independance from Jimbo. But right, a board with 3 members being the employees of a fourth is quite laughable :-) Why are we aquiescing to this foolishness ? Well, without giving details, I'd say that Michael is not aquieshing. Me neither. Pointing out to this situation more publicly might however have bad pr consequences. So, we need other solutions. Having subcommittees is part of the answer. Resigning is not. Evidence has shown that reality is manipulated.

::Regarding the Board's mandate to exclude online &quot;courses&quot;.  You are welcome to do as you please.  I intend to ignore it.  A rose by any other name is a rose.  If a section of engineering students or practioners who start by helping each other out with discussions of statics or stress problems leave behind themselves a learning trail adequate for engineering candidates to review in preparation for the Professional Engineering exams you are welcome to call it a &quot;review&quot; or &quot;learning trail&quot; rather than a &quot;course&quot;.  I suspect at the engineering school we will have a lot more trade studies and open source projects than actual &quot;courses&quot; if we ever achieve a stable URL space and an active community.

::I have not suggested you busy yourself exclusively with the burearacracy.  I have suggested that you complete whatever paperwork is necessary and sufficient to motivate the burearacry to quit stalling and activate our URL's and wiki databases and leave harassment of other wikiversity participants to other participants until you have completed this critical path activity.  By all means come back and participate (try to avoid announcing your status as a designated community leader and warning others of dire consequences from ignoring you) after completing this 30 minute milestone the committee needs for a fig leaf with the Board to demonstrate their masterful control of the willing volunteers.  I suggested an e-paragraph cover summary to deliver the existing proposal in an attachment (or via URL to a new official version).  It has been worked on and discussed to stale heat death over a couple of months and years.   No further evolution is likely without some actual field experimentation and resulting data.  Give them a suspense.  &quot;In conclusion, the active Wikiversity developers' would appreciate an active URL and Wiki NLT 1 May 06 so that we may organize a publicity drive and fund raising activities to support dedicated servers and software tailoring to coincide with summer break.&quot;  CC it to all the applicable community mailing lists.  Tell them which mailing list the Wikiversity participants intend to discuss it on or respond to specific concerns ... I suggest the Textbook-L list since Roberth volunteered it; he, you and I are already there; it will visibly reassure the Wikibooks community we are attempting to get out of their hair and policy space; and there has been no action on setting up the requested Wikiversity-L list. When they respond that all fund raising must be coordinated by the Board and funds directed to official Wikimedia Foundation accounts but that they will ask Brion to activate the URLs after you acknowledge their authority to control the money.  Be a good little selectee and transmit the required fig leaf.  &quot;Thank you for your efforts on our behalf.  I will inform the community we must work with the Treasurer of the Wikimedia Foundation and that we can expect the URLs and Wiki to be active in a few days since you, the committee, have graciously asked the Board in writing to request Brion to activate them.&quot;  It is not binding on anyone else considering supporting impending forks.  

::Please do not make the mistake of only asking for the singular activation of URLs.  If the Board or committee were inclined to unilaterally fulfill their responsibilities without public acknowledgement of their alleged authority then someone would have already been reading the draft proposals and the URLs would already be active to allow effective participation of thousands of initial experimenters.   Some of whom would be the people who were invited to come check us out via the &quot;Free the Curriculum&quot; and other presentations at Wikimania 05.  BTW.  Have you seen any financial reports regarding Wikimania?  Did the Foundation or a private party make or lose money on the event and what are the projections for future years?
:::We did not lose money, nor make money from the event. You may ask Delphine (notafish) for more details. Some private parties funded it, and may have got some indirect financials benefits due to its support
::Are the profits going to pay for public servers, stipends for cronies (forgive me ... respectable members of the Wikimedia Community), etc. 
:::Sorry, there were no profit, so it will not goes to paying for servers or people
::Are the audited expenses for travel, salary, lodging, etc. in line with other conventions hosted or sponsored by public/non profit foundations or commercial endeavers?
:::Good question ! Very good question. Well, as a non profit foundation, we have an independant audit mandatory. We recently picked up an audit firm and Michael cleaned up our finances the best he could. The audit started last week. 
::Hmm .. I seem to have drifted a bit here.  Too bad we do not have a reputable investigative news wiki available to support public ICT endeavers.

::I will check out the links you provide to meta at my earliest convenience.  Do not wait for me!  You are the man selected as the point of our stacked Board designed spear.  Go get em when and as you feel it appropriate.  Again, I advise merely dropping the spear and sending them a one paragraph email admitting we are finally ready and predominantly in compliance with their wise mandates (Two or three active &quot;courses&quot; in tens of &quot;schools&quot; must be less than .001% non compliance with the mandate right?   Multiple sides can posture around non data and non activity.  The important thing, after affirming the stacked Board is in charge and Wikia has the right to skim profits, is to collect some actual data regarding what might actually work in the field.)

=Summary=

Hi, I've been trying to figure out what's going on with Wikiversity, but I found nearly 30 uber-detailed discussions that I would need to grab a Slurpy and sit down for a week to read.  Can you tell/point me to a way/concise summary of where it's going?  It looked like you were a pretty major player with Wikiversity.

Furthermore, if I want to try to start up a class, do I need to be accredited/anything special like that?  Or is Wikiversity so boggled down now that I can't do that.

Anyways, just wondering about everything.  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 19:55, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

==Wikiversity course==

You gave me a bunch of info on wikiversity, so I thought you'd be interested in this:

[[School of Mathematics:Calculus]]

If you could advertise somehow, that would be nice.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 04:09, 9 July 2006 (UTC)


In reply to your questions!

The majority of the information your asked for I have in the course outline of the website:  [[School of Mathematics:Calculus]].  But just to repeat them anyways...

The materials (lectures, assignments, tests, what readings from the test, etc.) will be created in a sort of impromptu way, for two reasons:
1)This is a general Calculus class, I don't know where people are coming from, where they're starting from, nor what their goals are.  I.e., some people will want to know Calculus intuitively (an integral is, more or less, the area under a curve), and others (math majors, or those who are uber-ambitious and have knowledge of set theory) will want to know Calculus formally and rigourisly (this is a partition, this is a lower and upper integral, etc.).
2)Both Wikiversity and I am not accredited, rather then grade-choke, I have the opportunity to allow the person to take what he wants from the class, I don't like rote learning, so since I have the opportunity to move away from this, I will try and do so.

If I missed something, ask me again, but if you really are eager, then send a pretest my way (my email is on my front page)!  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 17:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

&quot;And you're saying that they are in the Wikibooks mentioned on that page, and that you're going to then teach people about Calculus using those books, and according to their needs - right?&quot;

Not entirely, I also mentioned that I'd be making assignments and lecture pages impromptu in Wikiversity as I said above.  The most I'd do with Calculus pages is assign reading for a certain day.

&quot;This might all be a bit confusing to you - in fact, it occurs to me to ask you about what you say on your page (&quot;I hope Wikiversity doesn't go away&quot;) - does this mean you hope the projects don't separate? Are you aware of the context of all this? See the links to the current proposal I gave you before, if not. In any case, I'd really like to hear your views on the matter. Thanks.&quot;

I meant exactly what it said, I simply just hope it doesn't get deleted, that's all.

Teh Wishes, [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 16:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

The course has already ended, there was a whopping one person (technically two people) that participated.  If you're interested in the format or results check it out:  [[School of Mathematics:Calculus]].[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 23:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

== International development, Sustainable development ==

Hi Cormaggio, 
I noticed your interest in [[International development]] &amp; [[Sustainable development]]. I'd like to see material on these topics too - I'm currently very active at [[Appropedia:|Appropedia]], and we're discussing the issue of textbooks at Appropedia's [[Appropedia:Appropedia:Village pump|Village pump]]. 

Personally I'm mainly interested in expanding the material on these topics on Wikipedia and Appropedia. If somebody wants to use that material for developing textbooks or courses, that's cool, but I don't want to focus on that just yet. (First things first.)

Anyhow, have a look at Appropedia and tell me your thoughts - is this kind of collaboration something that interests you?

btw, there's also a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject International development|WikiProject International development]], in case that's of interest. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:42, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Judaism was the first ethnic and religious group to oppose the prevailing Greek and Roman beliefs in many gods and to permanently adopt monotheism. Many Jewish beliefs and values were later carried over into its two most powerful progeny, Christianity and Islam, and Judaism continues to exert an influence far beyond that which one might expect from a relatively small religion.

According to the Old Testament, in the thirteenth century BC Moses was commanded by Jehovah to deliver the Hebrews from their Egyptian bondage.&lt;ref&gt;One should bear in mind that archaeological findings to date fail to support, and often contradict, biblical accounts of the establishment of the Jewish people.&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by miracles, he eventually succeeded. On reaching the desert, Moses climbed Mount Sinai, returning after forty days with the Ten Commandments. These became fundamental Hebrew laws,&lt;ref&gt;The descriptions of Moses’ exploits were written some 500 years after his death. Modern scholars consider the books of Moses to have had multiple authors, that their stories and the laws have been reworked and polished over many generations, and that Moses may not in fact have been a real person at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Since so many learned scholars and theologians conclude that most bible stories are invented, one wonders why they do not revise the Bible. Surely using an inaccurate source only perpetuates misunderstandings.)&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasize the importance of property, communal equality, individual rights, personal freedom and sexual morality.

Orthodox Jews believe that God gave the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The written Torah is maintained on scrolls in every synagogue where each week portions are read aloud. This, and the oral Torah (recorded as the Mishnah and the Talmud by rabbis in the Middle Ages) are said to contain all of God’s teachings for humankind.

The Hebrews, under Joshua, conquered Palestine, and later, under King David, established their capital in Jerusalem in 1003 BC, unifying the tribes of Israel. There, King David’s son Solomon built the first Jewish temple. Periods of prosperity as well as misfortune followed, and are recorded in the Old Testament. Assyrians, in 721 BC, conquered northern Israel, then drove ten of the twelve Israelite tribes into exile. In 586 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed Jerusalem and Solomon’s Temple, and the Hebrews were later exiled from the southern kingdom of Judah. Eventually the Hebrew tribes were allowed to return to Jerusalem as subjects of the Persian Empire. After a brief independence, they became subjects of the Roman Empire. Jerusalem was destroyed by Roman legions in 70 AD during the Great Revolt, and again the Jews dispersed. Many centuries of persecution followed, and the Jewish people only regained a land of their own, Israel, in 1948.

Jews maintained their faith through the many intervening centuries because they demanded strict adherence (through study, prayer and observance) to Judaism and to the Jewish Law; because they utilized one common language that all are required to know; because they practised an integrated communal and spiritual life; and because they were guided by an irrepressible hope for, and faith in, the establishment of a messianic kingdom.

Orthodox Jews believe that there is only one God, Yahweh, who created the universe, and who continues to govern it in an intelligible and purposeful manner. They also believe that they hold a covenant with their god, whereby they obey His laws in return for His acknowledgement that they are His chosen people, to be carefully cared for. In effect, Israel is to be the model for the human race.

The Jewish year includes five major and two minor festivals. Three of the major festivals were originally agricultural, and are thus tied to the seasons. (Passover celebrates their exodus from Egypt.) Practising Jews pray three times a day and recite benedictions (particularly before meals, which follow strict dietary laws). Male children, when eight days old, are publicly initiated into the covenant of Abraham through circumcision. Boys reach legal maturity at the age of 13, when they are considered adults and assume responsibility for observing all the Jewish commandments (bar mitzvah), and are called for the first time to read the Torah aloud in a synagogue. Girls reach maturity at 12 years of age.

Both men and women are expected to dress modestly, and are prohibited (by an extension of the requirement to separate the animal and vegetable spheres of life) from wearing any garment that combines both wool and linen. Men are required to wear a head covering called a kippah.

Orthodox Jews expect the Messiah to return, the dead to be resurrected, and there to be everlasting retribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Atheists (who deny the existence of any god), and non-believers (who lack any belief in a god), number about 1.2 billion. Agnostics (who state that there is insufficient evidence to prove or disprove the existence of God, and neither believe nor disbelieve that a god might exist), are likely to form part of this total. These individuals have been included in this brief survey because they constitute one-fifth of the world’s population, and because their opinions are relevant to the subject matter of this book.&lt;ref&gt;Deists believe that a god was necessary to start the world, but afterwards does not intervene. Theists believe that God oversees and knows everything we do. (Theism is not a necessary part of religion, as Buddhism, with its many, non-divine gods, demonstrates.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless numbers of philosophers and writers, from Lucretius to the present, have expressed non-belief either in the existence of gods or in their power over humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius (circa 99-55 BC) sought to show in his poem, ''On the Nature of Things'', that gods have no interest or intervention in human affairs, that what is observed is always due to natural causes, and that therefore gods and death should not be feared.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since no census, or its equivalent, sought atheistic or agnostic affiliations in past ages, we have no estimate of the number of followers such thinkers may have had.

Atheists typically consider the Bible, Koran, Vedas, Torah and other such texts to be simply records of myths or stories, and dismiss the idea that they could be revelations from a deity. They refute the existence of any god (as creator, or as a loving, caring overseer), and reject the concepts of divine creation, a soul, or an afterlife of any kind. On the other hand, non-believers simply do not believe in such things. They do not concern themselves with denying or affirming the possibility that a god or gods exist, and leave the whole matter for others to mull over.

Atheists may provide any of several reasons for their disbelief, the most common being the lack or inadequacy of evidence. In their opinion, all of the theological proofs that a god exists (particularly the Ontological, Cosmological, Teleological, and Moral arguments&lt;ref&gt;These theological arguments are as follows. Ontological: God, to be the greatest Being that can exist, must exist, for not to exist lessens His greatness. Cosmological: only a God could bring the universe into existence from nothing. Teleological: the universe and life seem intelligent in design and therefore must have been designed to some purpose. Moral: virtue, the highest duty, must be attainable, therefore God must exist to have made it so.&lt;/ref&gt;) have been clearly refuted in one manner or another. Miracles, and such concepts as the existence or presence of a satan or a god, they argue, are so contrary to the behaviour of all everyday experience and knowledge of the real world, that incontrovertible evidence is needed for them to be credible—the ubiquitous hearsay evidence being particularly weak. They counter religious believers by asking how an “all-knowing” god can also be “all-good,” how an “all-good” god can permit innocent children or animals to suffer, and how such a being could allow evil to exist.&lt;ref&gt;There are many reasons why more people prefer to believe a god exists rather than to not believe. First, our mind's rationality requires us to aim our decisions at accomplishing some purpose; for many, a belief that God demands certain behaviours provides all the purpose they need. Second, believing that “God is responsible for all” supplies a plausible explanation for everything unknown. For example, before our current understanding of nuclear physics (to trace the evolution of stars), or genetics (to draft an accurate depiction of life's evolution), or pathogens (to account for certain illnesses), a conceivable interpretation was that God was the creator of stars and people, or was driving out evil. “Explaining” significant unknowns by attributing them to the behaviour of a god is still the simplest, most readily understood, and in many cases, the most convenient, answer for the world’s poorly educated majority. A third reason is that prominent and persuasive personalities, who may have a vested interest in the continuation of such beliefs, foster them. (Claiming to believe in God is considered to convey an image of being a caring, honest and respectable person in many societies—an image sometimes negated by the facts, but one which is nonetheless useful when seeking re-election, and vital when one's career lies within the church.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Belief that God created all we see around us settles the question of how everything came into being, but it does not address the question of why the universe was created. This remains a mystery, to religions and to science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To say that there was a creator is to make a statement purported to be factual. Any statement claiming to be factual opens itself up to scientific investigation. (This is the rationale for conducting the Jesus Seminars, see http://virtualreligion.net/forum.) And science is valuable precisely because it rejects any supposition that has no way of being disproved. Beliefs, by definition, cannot be disproved in the minds of those who believe, and therefore cannot be scientific. (This is why Creationism is not a science.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Religions are based upon beliefs—or upon faith when belief is non-existent—rather than facts. Rational arguments can never deconstruct a believer’s mind, and there is nothing to be gained by embarking upon such an endeavour. However, rational arguments can shake faith (see [[../../Revelations And Conversions/Summary#cite note-0|Summary of Revelations and Conversions, footnote 1]]). And knowledge, particularly scientific understanding, can reduce or destroy an individual’s faith. Therein lies both danger (for purposeless minds are unhappy minds) and hope (for rationality’s future).&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheism holds no particular philosophical position,&lt;ref&gt;Turk al-Farabi, a tenth century Islamic philosopher, pointed out that philosophical truth was universal and must be superior to religious truth which varies. The following century, a Persian Islamic philosopher furthered this by stating that religion is philosophy made simple for the masses to understand. (This conflicts with my view. While believing in a god makes things simpler, religions seem excessively complex. I find their theologies impossible to unravel.)&lt;/ref&gt; and preaches no particular code of behaviour in refuting all divinities, spiritual religions and their doctrines. Although atheists must therefore develop their own standards of behaviour, there is no evidence that shows them to be any more or any less moral than those who have adopted the moral codes of a religion.&lt;ref&gt;For what it’s worth (given there are few true measures of “ethicality”), the following data on divorce rates might be interpreted to bear on the morality (if any) of this practice as carried out by members of different churches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A 1999 survey conducted by the Barna Research Group in Ventura, California, interviewing close to four thousand adults in 48 American states, found that 30% of Jews, 29% of Baptists, 27% of born-again Christians, 25% of mainstream Protestants, 24% of Mormons, and 21% each of Catholics, Lutherans, atheists and agnostics, have been through a divorce. (Data source, ''The Dallas Morning News'', 15 January, 2000, G4. This information may also be found at www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, one can conclude that data in this form is meaningless. On the other hand, one can think that, in as much as many religions promote the family unit, it may indicate something about the relative “morality” of followers of various religions compared to non-believers. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Religions, in one form or another, have existed from prehistoric times and frequently include much of the old in their new formats. They  share many characteristics, and some of these are listed (in no specific order) below.

Most religions, if not all, seem to have developed from the ideas of one thoughtful person, frequently one who desired to change people’s behaviour by educating them.&lt;ref&gt;Hinduism, being a compilation of ideas and beliefs, many of which are thousands of years old, cannot be traced back to one founder.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions and beliefs in a god or gods were once necessary to explain how the universe and life began, and why &quot;mysterious&quot; events such as eclipses and plagues occurred—roles now more skilfully performed by science (see [[../../The Universe/]] and [[../../Life/]]).

Religions incorporate and adapt occurrences remembered from the distant past (such as the Flood), as well as myths taken from other religions (such as Creation, or the Garden of Eden), and give them some special significance.

Religions differ from place to place,&lt;ref&gt;Xenophanes, Herodotus, Julius Caesar, and Cornelius Tacitus all noted differences in religious beliefs, traditions and practices as they travelled from one country to another.&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority of any population professing allegiance to the local creed. Periodically, differences of opinion arise that cause factions to split off and establish variants of the original belief.

People generally adopt the religion of their forefathers.&lt;ref&gt;See Benedict, ''Patterns of Culture'', 254.&lt;/ref&gt; However, individuals occasionally convert from their family religion to another, typically upon marriage to a person of another faith, or if pressing needs are not being met, if a compelling preacher attracts them, if converting brings financial or social benefits, or if practising their belief threatens their survival.

Religious groups build or select special places (such as churches, shrines or rivers) that are held to be significant in the conduct of that religion.

Religions develop formalized, hierarchically structured organizations that, whenever circumstances permit, grow larger, become more complex, and eventually build edifices of some magnificence.

Religions formulate ways to communicate with their god (such as meditation, the Eucharist, or prayer).

Religions develop rituals, life-cycle rites (such as baptisms, funerals and processions) and festivals to be conducted at particular times, on special days, or during certain seasons, when something of historical or seasonal significance is commemorated or celebrated.

Religions frequently teach by relating stories or parables crafted to illustrate virtues or values deemed to be worthy of emulation.

Religions prescribe how to behave (and, not infrequently, how to dress) and give reasons why this behaviour should be followed. They define procedures (such as confession, covering the head, or prostration) to be followed to achieve particular religious purposes, and they devise special behaviours (such as making the sign of a cross, undertaking pilgrimages, or genuflecting) that publicly demonstrate allegiance.

Religions integrate with and influence the society they service,&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim insisted that society itself makes religion important; that religion is neither a revelation from on high, nor the consequences of some misguided individual’s beliefs and actions (see Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life'', first published in 1915).&lt;/ref&gt; affecting many of their laws, customs, traditions, institutions, and moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;Moral standards vary from culture to culture. Practices such as polygamy, infanticide, suicide, genocide, male dominance (including the power of life or death over wives), killing ancient parents, genital mutilation, and torture, all formed part of past (and some current) cultures. A concept known as ethical relativism (see almost any text on anthropology) warns us against judging another culture’s morality using standards drawn from our own.&lt;br/&gt;
Most ethicists argue that there must be some underlying moral principles that are universally “right.” The trouble with this, as we now know, is that no one has found any such values, although some contend they have. The only single underlying principle, of any possible relevance, that I can think of, is the universe’s causality. Perhaps we will be able to use this, some day, to determine moral righteousness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions hold faith and belief to be more important than facts or reason.

Religions centre upon some kind of unity,&lt;ref&gt;About three billion people (including Christians, Muslims, and Jews) can be said to be unified by their worship of one theistic God. Another billion people (Hindus) identify Brahman as the one eternal, absolute reality that is the universe, with all else being manifestations. And Buddhists endorse the impersonal cosmic order as being the ultimate reality. Thus, religions generally focus on the idea of one entity, God or otherwise, being of dominant importance.&lt;/ref&gt; and state there is purpose to life. They give followers an identity and a morality, and provide solace and hope in times of trouble. Many religions hold that a heaven or paradise awaits all true believers after their death.

Above all, religions attempt to simplify moral decision making. (Perhaps this is why portions of religious texts are often cited as sanctioning actions taken, particularly by fundamentalists seeking to justify reprehensible acts).

This summary is in no way exhaustive—for instance, while followers receive many benefits from religions, few are listed here. Being able to provide so much for so many is probably the second most important reason  to support religions’ continuance. (The primary function of any religion is to provide the purpose used in moral decision making.)

However, while we gain much comfort from the beliefs and practices religions foster, religions can also hinder our ability to think rationally and openly. This may never have been more evident than it is today, when we might arguably claim that religious differences are creating more discord in the world than any other single issue, yet this topic is seldom raised at international levels (such as the United Nations), presumably out of fear that the discussions would rapidly become unmanageable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Religions have been developed by the efforts of prophets and their followers, men and women who refined ideas and beliefs about how human life might be improved, and then conveyed these ideas in a convincing manner to others. For this to happen, divine intervention has never been required—everything that such prophets and their followers experienced, witnessed, undertook, or relayed, everything that happened then, and everything that has happened since, can be more realistically explained as being the result of other causes. Nevertheless, approximately five billion (or about 80%) of the world’s population state that they believe in a god, and most, presumably, try to obey what they have been told are their god’s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;However, it may be that these statistics tell us more about the effect various social forces have on the assertions people make. There are many influences that might cause an individual to conceal their actual beliefs.
Writing this chapter reminds me that I not infrequently feel like the child in Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale, ''The Emperor’s New Clothes'', must have felt—different from most other people, and wondering what all the fuss is about. I see none of the colourful raiments that others claim adorn the flesh of the religions that parade our world. Am I blind? How many others see as little of significance as I? (And, how many others also think that much of religion is simply wishful make-believe?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But, worst of all, I sometimes think that we are all being deliberately misled by people in positions of influence who realize that the truth is not as they speak, but who gain by perpetuating falsehoods. What an evil that would be!&lt;/ref&gt;

Today we have over a million religions, all vying for attention, with many of them, in one manner or another, decrying their competitors. Is there no way our moral thinking might be better ordered?

There is. A way that does not deny or attempt to replace any of the existing religions—that would be an insult to some of humanity’s greatest achievements and a nonsensical proposition. But it must be possible to unify beliefs under a banner that allows all to embrace both old and new. There must be at least one universal moral code that captures the essence of being human, that defines who we are, states what we stand for, and guides nations when there are difficult decisions to make. An integrated and forward-looking code that might one day constitute the backbone of a universal religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans have learned much over the last two thousand years. In the past, we made incorrect guesses about the orbits of stars, today we build machinery that replicates their fusing atoms' behaviour; we used to speculate about the nature of blood, today we routinely replace failing organs; a thousand years ago men on horseback spread the news, today we employ the light-speed of electromagnetic waves.

All such progress depended, and will continue to depend, upon one thing—the ability to identify and root out faulty assumptions and replace them with facts. In other words, progress necessitates recognizing that the universe (and all that it contains and everything that happens) is rational. Once we do this, we realize that all situations can be analyzed and treated logically. Then, given enough time and effort, almost anything becomes possible—even by-passing emotionally-charged, long-standing, religious differences.

We have employed a rational approach in every field of human endeavour except religion. There, we fight new understandings, progress, and each other. No time has ever been more appropriate than the present to investigate alternative ways to meet our religious needs. Religions are not beyond betterment; they can incorporate new understandings, they can be redesigned. The rational approach can be used, even in the field of religious belief.

Science and religion have not always been strangers to one another. In Ancient Greece all speculative thought was considered to be philosophy; science and religion were (and often still are) speculative in nature. Both might profit from a tighter union for both address aspects of the same problem—our lack of knowledge. Most spiritual religions attempt to explain the creation of the universe and the planet’s organisms; many scientists work on exactly the same questions. However, religion and science operate at different ends of the knowledge gap. Religion starts at the “big end” with all the answers, usually declaring at the outset that a supreme being created all; science works at the “small end” and begins by asking questions, slowly building an understanding of the whole from a thorough examination of its parts.

Religion and science have another feature in common: both are founded upon a belief. While the belief held by religions is invariably made clear for everyone, the belief held by scientists is usually overlooked—however, it is just as fundamental and important.

Scientists, without exception, believe that all of the universe’s behaviour is rational, i.e., that effects follow causes which follow effects (the causality discussed in [[../Thinking/Thinking And The Universe|Thinking And The Universe]]). Religions, apparently sensing that some aspect of this belief counters theirs, invariably state (in one way or another) that some parts of the universe are not subject to rational inquiry.

Because science and religion are both based upon a belief, I suspect that unifying these beliefs would fully unify science and religion. Although not its intended purpose, the last half of this book seems to be showing how this might be brought about. Essentially, the belief that heads both disciplines is that which is used by each to make purposeful decisions. Religious beliefs regarding a judgement day and an afterlife influence behavioural decisions made by followers. Scientific beliefs that the universe is causal or rational determine the accuracy of solutions proposed by scientists. Both beliefs provide the “purpose” needed by the decision maker to make a choice about how to act—the religious in order to enter heaven, the scientist in order to have his or her findings accepted as valid.

To my mind, there is no reason for the purpose that heads scientific inquiry to be any different from the purpose that heads a religion. The problem is—how might such a joint purpose be stated? “To seek the truth,” might be accurate, but this is too simple a statement to have any practical utility. (The purpose proposed toward the end of [[../Looking For A Purpose/What Purpose Can We Use?|What Purpose Can We Use?]] may be a more useful one.) I leave this as a problem that some readers might like to take up. What a foundation for future civilizations to build upon would be created, should scientific and religious purposes become one!

Zoph (Zoph Organizes Photos) is a web based digital image presentation and management system. In other words, a photo album. It is built with PHP, MySQL and Perl. You can run it on your own server, but it's also compatible with most webhosting solutions.

Many people store their photos in the digital equivalent of a shoe box: lots of directories with names like 'Holiday 2008', 'January 2005' or even 'Photos034'. Like shoe boxes, this is a great way to put your photos away, but not such a great way to find them back or even look at them. Zoph can help you to store your photos and keep them organized.

While most photo album projects are primarily targeted at showing your photos to others, Zoph is primarily targeted at keeping your photos organized for yourself, giving you granular control over what you'd like to show to others, on a per-album or even a per-photo basis.

If you just want to generate a gallery of thumbnails from a bunch of images, you may want to try one of the other numerous photo album projects. But if you want to also store additional information about your photos, search them, or control access to them, take a look at Zoph.

Since the universe behaves in a reasonably predictable way, life forms able to correctly predict forthcoming events have a survival advantage. Sentient beings, able to plan ahead before acting, behave rationally when they predict a situation and make decisions that, when acted upon, help to achieve the chosen purpose. 

As well as rational decisions, human beings also use instinct and emotion, a 'quick and dirty' decision process based on successful habits. According to the meta-science of evolutionary psychology, religion is a survival tool, an attempt to develop those 'feelings' that help us survive - dealing with our neighbours, accepting certain constraints, and holding certain opinions, working together for some purpose such as world peace, international justice, or the glory of God is as much an emotional response to things that we find life-threatening as it is a rational response to 'making the world better'.

We might decide that &quot;supporting life's journey for humanity to become an omnipotent Being (oB)&quot; is a worthy goal, and we could make it our &quot;meta-purpose&quot; to guide moral decision making. However, this is too loose a statement for many practical purposes. While it might convey some emotional desires or feelings, it is not precise enough to guide the moral (and therefore physical) behaviour of an entire civilization 

A universal objective must be able to withstand all manner of challenges — legalistic, moralistic, religious, economic, scientific, rational, emotional, and many more.  A clearly defined “universal purpose,” could turn wishful conjecture into tangible and beneficial practices. Moreover, if a “universal purpose” were to be derived from the concept of assisting the survival of our species, then a worthy but dry legal document such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can come to life by providing the vision empowering people to constructively criticise the powerful.

In eras past, religions took generations to develop, with emotions playing a large part. Nowadays a sound religion might be rationally grown in a decade or two, via electronic communications. As shown in the title of this book, the emphasis is upon the need to develop a universal religion, and where one might look, not upon actually doing so. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to outline how such a fantasy might someday become a reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Requirements==

First, make sure you meet all the requirements in the [[Zoph/Requirements|previous chapter]].
==Unzip the .tar.gz file==
You can unzip the ''tarball'' in a temporary directory. In this example we'll use &lt;tt&gt;/tmp&lt;/tt&gt; and assume your downloaded Zoph version 0.9 into &lt;tt&gt;/home/user/Downloads&lt;/tt&gt;
 $ cd /tmp
 $ cp /home/user/Downloads/zoph-0.9.tar.gz .
 $ tar -xvzf zoph-0.9.tar.gz
 $ cd zoph-0.9
==Creating the database==
===Create a database and import the tables===
 $ mysql -u root -p -e &quot;CREATE DATABASE zoph CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci&quot;
 $ mysql -u root -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph.sql

===Create users for zoph===
I created two users: zoph_rw is used by the application and zoph_admin is used when I work directly in mysql so I don't have to use root.

 $ mysql -u root -p
 mysql&gt; grant select, insert, update, delete on zoph.* to zoph_rw@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

 mysql&gt; grant all on zoph.* to zoph_admin identified by 'PASSWORD';
==Install the templates==
===Pick a location to put Zoph===

Create a zoph/ directory off the doc root of your web server, or create a Virtual Host with a new doc root.

 $ mkdir /var/www/html/zoph
===Copy the templates===

 $ cp -r php/* /var/www/html/zoph/
===Set accessrights===
For better security, you probably want to set accessrights on your Zoph files. (You may want to do this after testing whether Zoph works, in that case you know what caused it when it seizes working after this change)

First, you need to figure out which user Apache is running under. Usually this is &lt;tt&gt;apache&lt;/tt&gt; for both user and group. To determine this, check &lt;tt&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/tt&gt; or use 
 ps -ef | grep httpd

You should probably make all files owned by the user &lt;tt&gt;apache&lt;/tt&gt; and the group &lt;tt&gt;apache&lt;tt&gt;. You can do than with
 chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/zoph 

You can either make them only readable by this user/group (more security): '''440''', readable by all users: '''444''', or readable and writable by all users: '''666'''. The last case means that you don't need root access to edit config.inc.php or to make changes to the other php files (such as upgrades to a new version). Keep in mind that your mysql password is in config.inc.php, so if you've users on your system that are not allowed to know it, you should choose the first option.
The directories should have execute rights: '''550''' for max security or '''777''' for access for all users.

To do this, first go to the directory directly above your Zoph directory, in this example /var/www/html

 cd /var/www/html
 chmod [dir] zoph
 cd zoph
 find -type f | xargs chmod [file]
 find -type d | xargs chmod [dir]

replace [dir] with the accesspattern you've chosen for directories above and replace [file] with the one for files.
{{Important|Double check whether you are using the correct directory and if you have typed it correctly, if you would accidently type &quot;/[space]var/www/html/zoph&quot; or something, you would change all files on your '''entire''' system to &lt;tt&gt;apache&lt;/tt&gt;/&lt;tt&gt;apache&lt;/tt&gt; as owner - not good).}}
===Access rights for your photos===
In many cases you can simply leave the access rights on you photo directories on default.
However, if you use both the CLI and the webinterface to access your photos, you may want to change to a more advanced way of managing accessrights, using the [setgid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setgid#setgid_on_directories] feature in Linux and most other POSIX Operating Systems.

* Create a new Unix group (in example &quot;photo&quot;)
 groupadd photo
* Add all users that use the CLI and/or are allowed to modify the photos on disk to this group (in this example, the user is called 'jeroen')
 useradd -g photo jeroen
* Additionally, the apache user is added to this group, on my system, this user is called 'apache', but 'www-data' is also often used.
 useradd -g photo apache
* Change the ownership of the photo directory to your user and the group photo
 chown jeroen:photo /data/images
* Set the permissions on this directory as you wish, for example 775 (full rights for user and group, read rights for other) or 770 (full rights for user and group, no access for others).
 chmod 775 /data/images
Now set 'setgid' on the dir, this causes new files and directories to be created with the group 'photo'.
 chmod g+s /data/images

==Configure the PHP templates==
Please see [[Zoph/Configuration|the chapter on configuration]] for details.

===&lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt;===
In Zoph 0.8.2 and later, you need to create a &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt; file, usually in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt; is where you define database settings. A simple example:
 [zoph]
 db_host = &quot;localhost&quot;
 db_name = &quot;zoph&quot;
 db_user = &quot;zoph_rw&quot;
 db_pass = &quot;pass&quot;
 db_prefix = &quot;zoph_&quot;
 
 php_location = /var/www/html/zoph

For more details, see [[Zoph/Configuration#zoph.ini|zoph.ini]].

==Test it==

Try hitting http://localhost/zoph/logon.php. You should be presented with the logon screen. Log in using &quot;admin&quot; for user and &quot;admin&quot; for password.

If you get a 404 error...
* make sure the zoph/ folder and templates can be seen by the web server.

If you see a bunch of code...
* make sure Apache is configured to handle PHP
**The Apache configuration needs to contain this:
 LoadModule php5_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
If you see a MySQL access denied error...
* make sure the DB_USER you specified in config.inc.php actually has access to the database. If your database is not on localhost, you will need to grant permissions to zoph_rw@hostname for that host.

      <comment>Added a list of removed options in v0.9.1 + a small list of options that remain</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Upgrading Zoph is a relatively simple process; it consists of moving the php, javascript, language and image files into your web root (beware that you may want to keep your &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;) and running an SQL script that makes the database changes. More details about this process and special instructions per version are described below.

==Zoph 0.9 to 0.9.1==
* ''You can use these instructions as well to upgrade from v0.8.4 or 0.9pre1 or 0.9pre2''
* ''If you want to upgrade from an older version, first follow the instructions to upgrade to 0.9. It is not necessary to install older versions first, you can just install the current version and follow the upgrade instructions below.''

===Copy files===
Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

===Database changes===
Execute zoph-update-0.10.sql:
 mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.10.sql
Change &lt;tt&gt;zoph&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;zophutf8&lt;/tt&gt; if you are working on the temporary database.

Changes this script makes:
* Adding a database table to store configuration
* Removing a field from preferences table for a removed preference
* Removing the rating field from the photos table
* Adding a view on the photos and rating table to get the average rating
* Adding an index on the rating table

===Migrating the configuration===
As of Zoph 0.9.1, configuration is mainly controlled from the GUI and no longer from &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;. This means that you either must migrate your configuration or make all configuration changes by hand.
* Log in to your Zoph installation with an ''admin'' user
** You may get some errors about because Zoph cannot find your photos in the default location, don't worry, we'll fix that next.
* Copy migrate_config.php from the contrib directory into your Zoph directory
* In your browser, replace &lt;tt&gt;zoph.php&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;migrate_config.php&lt;/tt&gt;
* Zoph will try to migrate your config to the new, database-based configuration.
* Delete migrate_config.php
* There are a few configuration-items left in config.inc.php, in most cases you'll want to leave those on default, so instead of manually removing all the no longer existing configuration-items, you may as well just overwrite your config file with the one included with Zoph.

===Removed Configuration options===
Since the configuration is now controlled from the Web GUI, most of the configuration options are now deprecated:
* ZOPH_TITLE
* MAX_CRUMBS
* MAX_DAYS_PAST
* ZOPH_URL
* ZOPH_SECURE_URL
* DEFAULT_TABLE_WIDTH
* CSS_SHEET
* ICONSET
* LANG_DIR
* DEFAULT_LANG
* DEFAULT_ORDER
* DEFAULT_DIRECTION
* $VALIDATOR
* FORCE_SSL
* FORCE_SSL_LOGIN
* THUMB_SIZE
* MID_SIZE
* THUMB_PREFIX
* MID_PREFIX
* MIXED_THUMBNAILS
* THUMB_EXTENSION
* ALLOW_ROTATIONS
* ROTATE_CMD
* BACKUP_ORIGINAL
* BACKUP_PREFIX
* IMAGE_DIR
* CLI_USER
* IMPORT
* UPLOAD
* IMPORT_DIR
* IMPORT_PARALLEL
* MAGIC_FILE
* TAR_CMD
* UNZIP_CMD
* UNGZ_CMD
* UNBZ_CMD
* MAX_UPLOAD
* USE_DATED_DIRS
* HIER_DATED_DIRS
* DIR_MODE
* FILE_MODE
* JAVASCRIPT
* EMAIL_PHOTOS
* WATERMARKING
* WATERMARK
* WM_POSX
* WM_POSY
* WM_TRANS
* ALLOW_COMMENTS
* AUTOCOMPLETE
* DOWNLOAD
* MAPS
* GOOGLE_KEY
* CAMERA_TZ
* DATE_FORMAT
* TIME_FORMAT
* GUESS_TZ
* SHARE
* SHARE_SALT_FULL
* SHARE_SALT_MID

===Configuration options in config.inc.php===
There are only a few options left that can be set in &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;. Normally you will not need to change them:
;[[Zoph/Configuration#VERSION|VERSION]] : Controls the version displayed in Zoph's GUI, only change this if you're a Zoph developper.
;[[Zoph/Configuration#RELEASEDATE|RELEASEDATE]] : Controls the release date displayed in Zoph's GUI, only change this if you're a Zoph developper.
;[[Zoph/Configuration#INI_FILE|INI_FILE]] : Location of zoph.ini
;[[Zoph/Configuration#THUMB_SIZE|THUMB_SIZE]] : Size of thumbnail files (you shouldn't change this)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#MID_SIZE|MID_SIZE]] : Size of mid size files (you shouldn't change this)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#THUMB_PREFIX|THUMB_PREFIX]] : Size of thumbnail files (you shouldn't change this)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#MID_PREFIX|MID_PREFIX]] : Size of mid size files (you shouldn't change this)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#LOG_ALWAYS|LOG_ALWAYS]] : Control debugging level
;[[Zoph/Configuration#LOG_SEVERITY|LOG_SEVERITY]] : Control debugging level
;[[Zoph/Configuration#LOG_SUBJECT|LOG_SUBJECT]] : Control debugging level

==Zoph 0.9 to 0.9.0.1==
* ''You can use these instructions as well to upgrade from v0.8.4 or 0.9pre1 or 0.9pre2''
* ''If you want to upgrade from an older version, first follow the instructions to upgrade to 0.9. It is not necessary to install older versions first, you can just install the current version and follow the upgrade instructions below.''

Upgrading from v0.9 to v0.9.0.1 consists of simply copying the files in place, no database upgrades are needed:

Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

No changes have been made to the CLI tool or man pages, so it's not needed to update them.
==Zoph 0.9pre1/2 to 0.9==
Upgrading from v0.9pre1 or v0.9pre2 to v0.9pre2 or v0.9 consists of simply copying the files in place, no database upgrades are needed:

Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

No changes have been made to the CLI tool or man pages, so it's not needed to update them.
==Zoph 0.8 to 0.9==
* ''If you want to upgrade from a version older then 0.8, first follow the instructions to upgrade to 0.8. It is not necessary to install older versions first, you can just install the current version and follow the upgrade instructions below.''
* ''If you want to upgrade from 0.8.4, you just need to copy the files, no database changes are needed''
* ''You can also follow these instructions to go to 0.9preX''
* ''You can also follow these instruction if you are on one of the maintenance releases of 0.8 (0.8.0.x)''
* ''If you are on one of the feature releases for 0.8 (0.8.x), except 0.8.4, you will need to edit &lt;tt&gt;zoph_update-0.9.sql&lt;/tt&gt; to comment any changes you have already made on your system.''

Copy the '''contents''' of the &lt;tt&gt;php&lt;/tt&gt; directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the &lt;tt&gt;lang&lt;/tt&gt; directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; to prevent overwriting it.
 cp config.inc.php config.local.php
 cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
 cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

Copy &lt;tt&gt;cli/zoph&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;/bin&lt;/tt&gt; (or another directory in your &lt;tt&gt;$PATH&lt;/tt&gt;).
 cp cli/zoph /bin
Copy &lt;tt&gt;zoph.1.gz&lt;/tt&gt; into your man 1 directory (usually &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/man/man1&lt;/tt&gt;) and zoph.ini.5.gz into man 5 (usually &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/man/man5&lt;/tt&gt;).
 cp cli/zoph.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1
 cp cli/zoph.ini.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5

===Database changes===
Don't forget to edit the sql script if you are running on 0.8.x.

Zoph 0.9 requires a manual upgrade to the database, this is described in [[Zoph/Upgrading/Changing_your_database_to_UTF-8|Changing your database to UTF-8]]. If you are on 0.8.1 or later, you should already have made this change.

Execute zoph-update-0.9.sql:
 mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph &lt; sql/zoph_update-0.9.sql
Change &lt;tt&gt;zoph&lt;/tt&gt; into &lt;tt&gt;zophutf8&lt;/tt&gt; if you are working on the temporary database.

Changes this script makes:
* Remove the people_slots setting from the user preferences table (0.8.4)
* Add a hash to the photos table (0.8.4)
* Add a setting to control whether or not the user is allowed to use the sharing feature in the users table (0.8.4)
* Added tables and preferences for geotagging support (0.8.3).
* Make the language field in the prefs table longer so languages like en-ca can be stored (0.8.1)

===Configuration updates===
In Zoph 0.8.2, &lt;tt&gt;.zophrc&lt;/tt&gt; and a part of &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; were replaced by &lt;tt&gt;[[Zoph/Configuration/zoph.ini|zoph.ini]]&lt;/tt&gt;. You can use &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini.example&lt;/tt&gt; in the &lt;tt&gt;cli&lt;/tt&gt; dir as an example.
(see [[Zoph/Configuration]] for details):
====New options====
;[[Zoph/Configuration#LOG_ALWAYS|LOG_ALWAYS]] : Control how much debug information is showed for all subjects.  (0.8.1)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#LOG_SEVERITY|LOG SEVERITY]] : Configure how much debug information is showed, for the subjects defined in LOG_SUBJECT  (0.8.1)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#LOG_SUBJECT|LOG_SUBJECT]] : Configure on which subject you would like to see logging. 0.8.1)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#CLI_USER|CLI_USER]] : User id that the CLI client uses to connect to Zoph. Must be admin. Change this into '0' to let Zoph lookup the user from the Unix user that is running Zoph. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT|IMPORT]]: Enable ('1') or disable ('0') webimport (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#UPLOAD|UPLOAD]]: Enable ('1') or disable ('0') uploading photos through the browser (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_DIR|IMPORT_DIR]]: Directory, relative to [[Zoph/Configuration#IMAGE_DIR|IMAGE_DIR]], that will store uploaded photos until they have been imported in Zoph. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_PARALLEL|IMPORT_PARALLEL]]: Number of photos to resize concurrently. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#MAGIC_FILE|MAGIC_FILE]]: MIME Magic file. Zoph needs this to determine the file type of an imported file. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#FILE_MODE|FILE_MODE]]: File permissions for files imported in Zoph. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#UNGZ_CMD|UNGZ_CMD]]: Command to be used to decompress .gz files. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#UNGZ_CMD|UNBZ_CMD]]: Command to be used to decompress .bzip files. (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE|SHARE]] : Enable the possibility to share a photo by using a URL that can be used without logging in to Zoph. Once enabled, you can determine ''per user'' whether or not this user is allowed to see these URLs. (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_FULL|SHARE_SALT_FULL]] : When using the SHARE feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo. Because you do not want people who have access to you full size photos (via Zoph or otherwise) to be able to generate these hashes, you should give Zoph a secret salt so only authorized users of your Zoph installation can generate them. This one is used for fullsize photos (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_FULL|SHARE_SALT_FULL]] : When using the SHARE feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo. Because you do not want people who have access to you full size photos (via Zoph or otherwise) to be able to generate these hashes, you should give Zoph a secret salt so only authorized users of your Zoph installation can generate them. This one is used for midsize photos (0.8.4)
====Removed options====
The following configuration options no longer exist, you should remove them from you &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;:
;[[Zoph/Configuration#DB_HOST|DB_HOST]] : Moved to &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt; (0.8.2)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#DB_NAME|DB_NAME]] : Moved to &lt;tt&gt;zoph.ini&lt;/tt&gt; (0.8.2)

;[[Zoph/Configuration#USE_IMAGE_SERVICE|USE_IMAGE_SERVICE]] : The Image Service is now always on. If you were previously using &lt;tt&gt;define('USE_IMAGE_SERVICE', 0)&lt;/tt&gt;, you should move your images out of your webroot, and update &lt;tt&gt;IMAGE_DIR&lt;/tt&gt; accordingly. (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#WEB_IMAGE_DIR|WEB_IMAGE_DIR]] : This was only needed when &lt;tt&gt;USE_IMAGE_SERVICE&lt;/tt&gt; was enabled. (0.8.4)
;[[Zoph/Configuration#MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS|MAX_PEOPLE_SLOTS]] : The people slots feature, that allowed multiple 'add people' dropdowns on the edit photo and bulk edit photo pages has been replaced by a Javascript that automatically adds a new dropdown whenever a new person is added, allowing a virtually unlimited amount of people to be added in one edit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This manual will describe how to start using Zoph. It assumes you have successfully installed all the components and are presented the logon screen when you visit http://localhost/zoph/logon.php.

==Logging In For The First Time==

An admin user was created when you loaded the database. You should be able to login as 'admin' using the password 'admin'. You will be presented with Zoph's home page where you will be greeted as 'Unknown Person'. There will be a blank square where a random photo would normally appear.

The first thing you should do is change the admin's password:

# Click on the 'prefs' tab.
# Click the 'change password' link.
# Enter a new password and click 'submit'. 

Next, create a 'person' record for yourself:

# Click on the 'people' tab.
# Click on the &lt;nowiki&gt;[ new ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; link on the right.
# Fill in your first name, last name and whatever other fields you wish.
# Click the 'Insert' button. 

Now create a user for yourself:

# Click on the 'admin' tab.
# Click on the 'users' icon.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ new ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# Pick a username and password.
# Select yourself from the person pulldown.
# Change your class to Admin.
# Click the 'Insert' button. 

An admin has permission to do anything so you don't need to grant the specific 'browse' or 'view details' permissions, nor grant permissions to individual albums.

Now that you have created a user:

# Click on the 'logout' tab.
# Login as your user.

==Creating An Album, Category and Place==

Before importing some images we'll create an album to put them in. Note that you do not need to assign photos to an album if you don't want to.

To create an album:

# Click on the 'albums' tab.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ new ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# Pick an album name. I'm using &quot;Zoph Tutorial&quot; for this example.
# Add an album description if you wish. This can be left blank.
# Click the 'Insert' button. 

To create a category, click on the 'category' tab and do exactly as above. In creating this tutorial I took a picture of my hand so I created an &quot;Appendages&quot; category for it.

Both albums and categories are hierarchical in nature (each entry can have children entries as well). When you view photos in an album or category within Zoph you automatically see photos placed in that album or category's children as well.

To create a place:

# Click on the 'places' tab.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ new ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# Enter a title and city at minimum.
# Click the 'Insert' button. 

==Importing photos==
See [[Zoph/Importing photos|Importing photos]].

==Viewing Photos==
Now that there are some photos in the database, I'll go over some features of the web interface. The UI is fairly self explanatory so you probably don't really have to read this section.
===Finding Photos===
There are numerous ways to find the photos you just entered, a few of which are:

# Browse to the album you created and click &lt;nowiki&gt;[ view photos ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# Browse to yourself in 'people' and click &lt;nowiki&gt;[ photos by ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# Browse to the place you took of photo and click &lt;nowiki&gt;[ photos at ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
# Use the search form. Specifying no criteria will bring up all photos.
# Use the 'photos' tab and you can browse every photo in Zoph. 

===The Results Page===
By default the results page will show thumbnails of up to 12 photos (you can change this from the 'prefs' page). On the prefs page you can also choose whether or not to display descriptions under the thumbnails.

From this page you can:

# Click on a thumbnail to go to the photo page.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ Prev ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[ Next ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or use the pager, to page through the photos (if your results span more than one page).
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ Slideshow ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to enter slideshow mode.
# Reorder the photos by choosing a field from the pulldown.
# Change the direction of ordering by clicking on one of the triangles. The white triangle/arrow represents the current direction.
# Change the number of rows and columns displayed. 

===The Photo Page===
Here you'll see a mid sized version of the photo plus all the information about the photo available.

From this page you can:

# Click the name of the file or the image itself to bring up the full sized photo.
# Click on a person, place, album, category or date to take you to the corresponding pages.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ Prev ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[ Next ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to move through the photos as they appeared on the results page.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ email ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to email the photo (if EMAIL_PHOTOS was set).
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ lightbox ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to add the photo to your lightbox (if you have one)
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ edit ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;[ delete ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (if you are an admin or have been given write permission on the album in which the photo appears). 

If you set the auto edit pref, you will automatically be presented with fields to edit the info about a photo whenever you click on a thumbnail. Clicking [ return ] takes you back to the regular view.
===Slideshows===
The slideshow mode (entered from the results page) will cycle through the current set of photos by refreshing the browser window. The interval between refreshes can be set on the 'prefs' page.

From the slideshow page you can:

# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ pause ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to pause the slideshow.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ stop ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to return to the results page.
# Click on &lt;nowiki&gt;[ open ]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to view the current photo on the normal photo page. 

===The Search Page===

You can search for photos using multiple criteria on the search page. Note that when you select an album or category, all descendant albums or categories will also automatically be chosen.

By default all criteria are joined by &quot;and&quot;. You can choose &quot;or&quot; instead from the pulldowns in the left most column. Since you can not specify groupings of the conditions, you might not get the results you want if you try to construct complex queries using different conjunctions.

Note that the album, category, location, person and photographer menus are pruned so that only those entries that actually appear in a photo that the user has access to are shown.

===Random Photos===

The thumbnail that appears on the 'home' page is randomly selected. I tend to like this photo to be somewhat good so I created a setting on the 'prefs' page that lets you specify the minimum rating to be used when selecting a random photo.

If you want to create a never ending slideshow of random photos, you can do this by clicking the &quot;randomly chosen photo&quot; link on the home page. If you then click the [ Slideshow ] link on the results page a new random photo will be chosen for each slide.

===Lightboxes===

Lightboxes give someone a place to gather and share their favorite photos. In Zoph, lightboxes are simply albums. When editing a user, an admin can declare a certain album to be the lightbox for that user. The admin must grant the user permission to view the lightbox album as well.

IMPORTANT: Don't give a user write permission on their lightbox album. The user could then add any photo to their lightbox and be able to edit it.

Whenever the user views a photo they can click a 'lightbox' link which will add that photo to their lightbox. When a user is viewing their lightbox, each photo will have an 'x' below it. Clicking this will remove that photo from the lightbox.

Lightboxes allow users to gather photos of interest to them without requiring the ability to edit a photo to place it in an album.

Lightboxes are only activated for a user by specifying a lightbox album. The setup I used was to create a &quot;Lightbox&quot; album, under which I created separate albums for each user's lightbox (e.g. &quot;Jason's Lightbox&quot;).

To share a lightbox an admin must grant permission to that album to other users.
==Managing Users, Groups &amp; Restricting Access==

One of the features of Zoph is its system of access privileges. You have already created an admin class user for yourself. If you desire, you can create other users as well.
===Users===
====Creating a new user account====
#Log on with an admin account.
#Click &quot;admin&quot; in the menubar.
#Click &quot;users&quot;.
#Click &quot;new&quot; in the right top of the screen.
#Specify a user name (e.g. first initial + last name).
#If the user is also represented by a &quot;person&quot; in your database (for example because he or she has taken photos or appears on them), specify a person, otherwise leave it on &quot;Unknown Person&quot;.
#Specify a password
#Select a user class: an Admin can do anything at all. A User has restrictions. In that case, you can specify what a user can see, besides photos:
#*browse people: the user can view the 'people' page in which all the people stored in the database can be seen.
#*browse places: the user can view the 'places' page in which all the places stored in the database can be seen.
#*details of people: if &quot;Yes&quot; the user can see all information about any person. If &quot;No&quot; the user will only see a person's name.
#*details of places: if &quot;Yes&quot; the user can see all information about any place. If &quot;No&quot; the user will only see a place's title and city.
#*import: if &quot;Yes&quot; the user can import photos
#*download zipfiles: if &quot;Yes&quot;, this user can download a set of photos (album, category, search result, etc.) as a zip file.
#*leave comments: if &quot;Yes&quot;, this user can leave comments with photos.
#*rate photos: if &quot;Yes&quot;, this user can rate photos.
#*rate photos multiple times: if &quot;Yes&quot;, this user can rate the same photo more than once. Use this if you create an account that is used by multiple people. Each photo can be rated once per IP address.
#*lightbox: the user's lightbox album
#Click &quot;insert&quot;
#Add the user to one or more groups. See [[#Groups|groups]] how to do that.
====Modifying or deleting a user account====
#Log on with an admin account.
#Click &quot;admin&quot; in the menubar.
#Click &quot;users&quot;.
#Click the user you want to modify
#Click &quot;edit&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;
#Make the desired changes or confirm in case of a deletion.
#*For a description of the fields, see [[#Creating a new user account|creating a new user account]].

===Groups===
In order to give users access to photos, you must create one or more groups, you can then give accessrights to albums to those groups, you could for example create a group 'family', a group 'colleagues' and a group 'friends'. A user can be member of multiple groups and Zoph will combine the accessrights for all the groups.
====Creating a group====
#Log on with an admin account.
#Click &quot;admin&quot; in the menubar.
#Click &quot;groups&quot;.
#Enter a group name
#If desired, enter a description.
#Click &quot;insert&quot;
#You will automatically be taken to the edit group screen. See [[#Modifying a group|Modifying a group]] for an explanation.
====Modifying a group====
#Log on with an admin account.
#Click &quot;admin&quot; in the menubar.
#Click &quot;groups&quot;.
#Click on &quot;display&quot; next to the group name you wish to edit
#Click on &quot;edit&quot;
#You can change the group name or description and add or remove a member.
#*If you modify the group name, all the members will automatically change to the new group.
#*Select a user from the list to add them to the group
#*To remove a member from the group, tick the box in front of the username
#Click &quot;update&quot;.
#*This screen has two &quot;update&quot; buttons, be sure to click the top one for these modifications.
#To add albums to the list this user can view, use the &quot;grant access to all existing albums&quot; or add a specific album.
#*For a more detailed explanation, see [[#Albums|albums]].
#Click &quot;update&quot;.
#*This screen has two &quot;update&quot; buttons, be sure to click the bottom one for these modifications.
#*Be sure to modify either the top or the bottom half of this screen and not both.
===Albums===
For non-Admin users, permissions to view photos are granted on a per album basis. For each album you grant a group access to, you must specify:

#An access level
#A Watermark level (if you have enabled watermarking in &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt;: see [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARKING|WATERMARKING]])
#Whether that album will be writable 

Zoph determines whether a user has access to a photo checking two things:

#Is this photo in an album that at least one of the groups the user is member of has access to?
#If so, is the group's access level for that album greater than or equal to the level of the photo? 

If both of these conditions are met, the user has access to the photo.

If a photo appears in more than one album, a user needs only to have permission on one of them to see the photo. If the user has access to multiple albums in which a photo is found, or the user has multiple groups that give access to the photo, the least restrictive (highest access level) permission is used.

The level of a photo (and therefore of access levels) can range from 0 to 10. The default access level is 5.

Zoph is designed so that these privileges should work transparently. It should appear to any user that they have access to all photos. There should be no reference to any album or photo (including photo counts) to which a user does not have access.

If an album is marked writable, members of the group may edit (but not delete) the photos that they have access to in that album.

If you want to grant a group access to all albums you can do this all at once and the access level and writable flag will apply to every album. This is handy if you want to let someone see everything but don't want them to change anything.

Note that when you create new albums you will have to grant permissions to any non-Admins before they will be able to see those album.

==Comments==
As of v0.6 users can leave comments, if [[Zoph/Configuration#ALLOW_COMMENTS|ALLOW_COMMENTS]] is turned on.

As of v0.7.2 / v0.8 users can use (limited) markup in the comments, as well as smileys.

The following markup is supported:
&lt;nowiki&gt;[u]underline[/u], [i]italics[/i] and [b]bold[/b]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the various possible smileys are displayed with the comment input form:
[[Image:ZophComment.png]]
==Watermarking==
You can let Zoph superimpose a watermark over the fullsize picture. You can use this feature if you want your users to be able to look at the high quality pictures, but not use them for publication.
To use this feature, the [[Zoph/Configuration#IMAGE_SERVICE|IMAGE_SERVICE]] has to be enabled.
Zoph will put a watermark on each photo that has a level higher than the watermark level.

==Scenarios==
===Access levels===
Say you create an account for your parents but you don't want them to see the photos in the &quot;New Years Party&quot; album. Simply don't grant them permission to that album.

However, say the photos in this album are mostly harmless, except for a few that you would like to keep hidden. In this case, change the level of those photos to 6 (or higher) and grant the user permission to the album with an access level of 5 (or less).
===Watermarks===
You have taken a couple of brilliant landscape images. You really want to show them to one of your regular customers, but you're affraid they will simply take your image and publish it, without paying for it. You put the photos in an album &quot;Landscape&quot; and set their level to 3. 

After that, you give your customers account access level 5 and watermark level 2. They will now be able to watch the photo, but when they look at the fullsize image, a large copyright message will be superimposed over the photo. In this way, they will be able to judge the quality of the image, but it will be unusable to use in their productions.

After they have payed for the photo, you can put the image in an album that does allow them to see the photo without a watermark, change the level of the photo or change the watermark level. (keep in mind that the latter two will also influence other accounts or photos, respectively).

===Defining a Default User===
Starting with Zoph 0.2.1 a default user can be defined. This user is automatically logged in when a person first opens Zoph in their browser.

If you use Zoph locally you may want to make yourself the default user so that you never have to bother logging in. You may also want to use this feature to create a guest account with limited permissions.

To create a guest user, first create a person record to associate with the user (this could just be first name Guest, last name User). Then create a guest user, grant that user whatever permissions you want and set the user's preferences. Whichever user is defined as the default user is unable to modify their preferences while they are the default.

You will now need to find the user_id of your guest user. The simplest way is probably to look at the url when you are viewing the users's record in zoph (user.php?user_id=3).

The default user is defined in config.inc.php:

 // set to the id of a non admin user or to 0 to disable
 // note that this is a user_id, not a person_id
 define(DEFAULT_USER, 3);

That's it. Now when you hit /zoph/zoph.php for the first time you'll be logged in as the guest user (if you are already logged in as someone you'll first have to log out). You can also log out when you are the guest user to be able to log back in as someone else.

What if a guest hits logout and wants to get back in but doesn't know the guest account info? Hitting submit on the logon page without specifying a user name or password will log you in as the default user.
==Pages, Pagesets and ZophCode==
By default, each album, category, place and person has a page that will show the basic data about this object. In some cases, you may want to customize this page. As of Zoph 0.7.2 it is possible to do so, using the ZophPages feature.

===ZophCode===
A ZophPage is written in ZophCode. ZophCode is very similar to bbCode or html and consist of tags in square brackets.
Currently supported tags are:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; border-collapse: collapse;&quot; border=1|
|+ZophCode
!style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;|Tag
!style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;|Meaning

|Thumbnail of a photo
|[thumb=123]
|-
|[mid=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;]
|Mid-size image of a photo
|[mid=123]
|}
It is possible to nest tags. For example:
 [h1]Holiday in [b]Spain[b][/h1]
 [i]more [u]emphasis[/u] by [b]combining[/b] tags[/i].
 Click on this thumbnail to see the photo: [photo=123][thumb=123][/photo]
Just make sure you open and close the tags in the right order:
 [b]This [i]will[/b] not[/i] work!

Finally, you can use smileys. See [[#Comments]] for an overview.
===Pages===
You can create a new page by going to the admin page and clicking on &quot;Pages&quot;. Just type your text and tags and save. If you would like to spread the content over multiple pages, just save this one and create another page.

===PageSets===
The next step is to combine 1 or more pages into a pageset. Keep in mind that if you have only one page, you still have to put it into a pageset.
Create a pageset from the admin page and add the pages you would like to have in this pageset to it. You can also define the order in which the pages appear in the pageset by clicking on &quot;move up&quot; and &quot;move down&quot;.

You also have to decide what you would like to do with the original page Zoph automatically creates for each album, category, place and person. You can choose to never display it, to display it on the first page, the last page or on each page. You can also choose whether you would like to see you own page first or the auto-generated. Keep in mind that if you choose to never display the original page, you could restrict navigation for your users. For example, if you have an album with a few sub-albums, your users will be unable to navigate to these subalbums unless you provide links in your page to these subalbums (and add new links every time you have added a new sub-album).

====Assigning a PageSet to an object====
The final step in enabling the ZophPages feature, is assigning the pageset to and album, category, place or person. You can do that by editing the specific object and choose the pageset.

==Preferences==
A user can customize Zoph using the preferences page. Below are descriptions of a few of the prefs.
===Breadcrumbs===
Between the tabs and the title bar you'll see a list of breadcrumbs by default. On the prefs page You can specify the number of breadcrumbs to show or you can choose to disable the breadcrumbs completely.

One note about breadcrumbs: clicking on the small x to the right of the breadcrumbs will clear the list of crumbs.
===Choosing a Language===
The default value is 'Browser Default'. This means that Zoph will try to present itself in the language you can specify in your browser's settings. If no translations are present for any of the languages in your browser's list, English will be displayed by default.

If you specify a language on the prefs page instead of 'Browser Default' your setting will override whatever you have your browser set to.

The language files are stored in php/lang. Creating a new translation involves creating a file in this directory with the language's two letter code in lowercase. Use one of the existing (non English) language files as an example.

===Other Prefs===
Here are descriptions of a few of the other prefs:

* days past for recent photos links: the home page has links to view photos taken or modified in the past X days, this pref sets the number of days.
* display camera info: if set to No, when viewing the details of a photo, fields like camera make and model, focal length, exposure, etc. are not displayed.
* automatically edit photos: if set to Yes, when an admin or a user with write permission views the details of a photo, they are immediately taken to the edit screen. This is handy for editing one photo after another.
* color scheme: the color scheme to use. Admins can click on &quot;color scheme&quot; to add, edit and delete color schemes. 
==Backing Up Your Data==
It's always a good idea to back up you photos. Periodically sync them to another machine or burn them to a cd. Zoph should never delete your photos, when you delete something from the ui only the database record is removed.

You should also periodically export the database. After you spend hours inserting and updating photos into Zoph, take two seconds and do the following:

 &gt; mysqldump -u zoph_admin -p zoph &gt; zoph-`date +%Y%m%d`.sql
==Integrating Zoph==

In this section I thought I'd mention a couple of tips if you are interested in trying to integrate Zoph with other parts of your website. This is still a work in progress.
==Looking Up People==
Say you have a site that has its own person or user records and you would like to map between the two systems (you want to put a &quot;photos of&quot; link on the profile page of a user, for example). Though Zoph usually uses it's own person_id field, you can pass a name instead:

http://www.zoph.org/demo/photos.php?person=Jason%20Geiger

will show you photos of a person. You also can use &quot;photographer&quot;:

http://www.zoph.org/demo/photos.php?photographer=Jason%20Geiger

Or instead of jumping to the photos page you can hit the person page:

http://www.zoph.org/demo/person.php?person=Jason%20Geiger

==Other Lookups==

For albums, categories and locations these sorts of lookups don't exist at the moment. But they are fairly easy to incorporate if anyone is interested.

Of course it is easy to generate urls for the other photo fields (that don't require joins) like title or description. Just call photos.php?field=val. Any string that does not start with an underscore is assumed to be a field to search on.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Installing the scripts==
==Install the perl scripts==
If you are using Zoph 0.8.2 or later, the Perl scripts have been replaced by PHP scripts. Please read [[Zoph/Installation/CLI in 0.8.2 and later|CLI in 0.8.2 and later]].
===Check the path to perl===

The perl scripts points to /usr/bin/perl. If your perl is in a different place, edit the first line of the script.

===Configure the database variables===
Edit &lt;tt&gt;zophrc.sample&lt;/tt&gt; (in the &lt;tt&gt;bin&lt;/tt&gt; directory of the Zoph tar.gz) so that the following variables match the values you put in config.inc.php:
 $db_host = 'localhost';
 $db_name = 'zoph';
 $db_user = 'zoph_rw';
 $db_pass = 'pass';
 $db_prefix = 'zoph_';

 $image_dir = '/data/images/';

And then move this file to the home directory of the user you are planning on using to import photo's. Probably your own home directory. Save it under the name &lt;tt&gt;.zophrc&lt;/tt&gt;.

You can also set some defaults in this file, in this way you do not need to always provide these commandline arguments:

 $datedDirs = 0;
 $copy = 0;
 $hierarchical = 0;
 $verbose = 0;
 $resolveSymlinks = 0;

Make sure the file ends with
 1;
Because Perl does not like it when the last assignment of the file is negative.

===Copy bin/zophImport.pl and bin/zophExport.pl to /usr/local/bin===

Or some other directory in your PATH.
===Install the man page===

A man page for zophImport.pl is in the man/ directory. Copy this to somewhere in your manpath, /usr/local/man/man1 for example.


==ZophImport.pl==

===Loading Images===
This section describes the command line Perl importer. The next one talks about the web based importer.

First get some images to load. Zoph was created to manage photos taken by digital cameras (which contain info in their exif headers) but you could use anything.

You should have defined an IMAGE_DIR variable in config.inc.php during installation. For this example, I have the image service disabled and my IMAGE_DIR set to a photos directory in my home directory. I have created a symbolic link from zoph/photos (off the web server's doc root) to this directory:

 &gt; ln -s $HOME/photos /var/www/zoph/photos

You can organize your photos under this directory in any way you choose. I'll provide examples of two possible systems. Read over these minimal examples before actually loading your photos.
===Minimal Examples===

Within my images directory I separate things by camera and by date. I have a Kodak DC280 so I created a dc280 directory:

 &gt; pwd
 /home/jgeiger/photos
 &gt; ls
 dc280

Here is one way to import photos. I store photos to be imported in an incoming directory in my home directory.

 &gt; ls ~/incoming
 DCP_0155.JPG
 &gt; zophImport.pl --path dc280 --datedDirs ~/incoming/*.JPG

The --path flag tells the importer I want the photos to be put in the dc280 directory. The --datedDirs flag means that the photo should be put in a subdirectory based on the date field found in the photos Exif header. After running the script:

 &gt; ls dc280
 2002.03.14
 &gt; ls dc280/2002.03.14
 DCP_0155.JPG mid thumb

The mid/ and thumb/ directories hold images scaled down to 120 and 480 pixels respectively. If you wonder why zophImport.pl takes so long to import photos it is because it is creating these two smaller images (using ImageMagick's convert utility).

What if you don't want to use dated directories to store your images? Here is an alternative way:

 &gt; pwd
 /home/jgeiger/photos
 &gt; mkdir christmas_2001
 &gt; zophImport.pl --path christmas_2001 ~/incoming/*.JPG
 &gt; ls christmas_2001
 DCP_0155.JPG mid thumb

The same result could have been accomplished by:

 &gt; mkdir christmas_2001
 &gt; mv ~/incoming/*.JPG christmas_2001/
 &gt; zophImport.pl christmas_2001/*.JPG

By not specifying a path, the importer uses the path that the photos are currently in.

Whatever way you import photos, make sure you run the script from within your photos directory (as specified by IMAGE_DIR). The importer needs to be able to correctly extract the relative path to the photos from here to be stored in the database.
===Detailed Example===
It is best to set as much information about photos during import so you don't have to do it one photo at a time within Zoph. I often have a directory of images to import that were all taken at the same time which makes this easy to do.

Here is what I used to load the images I took for this tutorial:

 &gt; pwd
 /home/jgeiger/photos
 &gt; zophImport.pl --path dc280 --datedDirs --photographer &quot;Jason Geiger&quot; --location &quot;Jason's Apartment&quot; --album &quot;Zoph Tutorial&quot; ~/incoming/*.JPG

To use the --photographer, --location and --album parameters, corresponding records must have been previously created in Zoph. So first create a person/place/album/category using the web interface, then import using them.

What if you made a mistake, or remembered a piece of information you want to add? Pass the --update parameter so that the photos will not be inserted again:

 &gt; zophImport.pl --update --field rating=5 --field description=&quot;This is part of the zoph tutorial&quot; dc280/2002.03.14/*.JPG

This will set the rating and description for all the photos I just imported. To set any of the fields found in the photos table (such as rating, title, description, etc), use the --field NAME=VALUE flag.

For more info and examples about the importer, see the section at the end of this document.
===Broken Images===
It is not uncommon to make a mistake while loading images so that when you view the ui you see a bunch of broken images. This most likely due to an invalid path. To check, edit one of the images in Zoph and click on &quot;show additional attributes&quot; at the bottom. Then you should be able to see the path info. It should always be the case that WEB_IMAGE_PATH (or IMAGE_PATH) + the photo's path field + the photo's name reflects the photo's location.

You can use the importer to correct the paths for broken images:

 &gt; zophImport.pl --update --path 'dc280/2002.03.14' dc280/2002.03.14/*.JPG

If you still see broken images, check the permissions on the files and directories.

===Command Line Options===

Here is a list of all the fields that can be set when importing:

* --datedDirs (put photos in YYYY.MM.DD dirs)
* --hierarchical (put photos in hierarchical dated dirs (YYYY/MM/DD) (&gt;v0.5) you need to also specify the --datedDirs argument, otherwise this will not work.
* --update (update existing photos)
* --updateSize (update the photo's width, height and size. implies --update.)
* --updateExif (reparse and load the exif headers. implied --update.)
* --useIds (use photo_ids not file names to identify photos for update)
* --noThumbnails (do not generate thumbnails)
* --album ALBUM
* --category CATEGORY
* --photographer &quot;FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME&quot;
* --location PLACE_TITLE
* --people &quot;FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME&quot;
* --path PATH (relative to IMAGE_DIR)
* --field NAME=VALUE (use to set title, view, description, rating, level, etc) 
* --verbose (give more information about what's going on) (&gt;v0.5)
* --copy (copy instead of move photos) (&gt;v0.5)
* --resolveSymlinks (resolve symlinks before importing) (&gt;=0.7)

Photos can appear in multiple albums and categories, and multiple people can be in a photo. To handle this, you can either pass a comma separated list or set the flag multiple times. Actually, you can use a comma separated list for categories and people but not for albums (since I realized that I have many albums with commas in their names and have yet to build an escape mechanism).

===EXIF Fields===
The following fields will be set automatically if they can be extracted from the EXIF header. They can also be set manually, using the --field NAME=VALUE flag, if you wish. This is by no means an exhaustive list of possible EXIF headers but these are the ones that have been set by the cameras I have used or that have been reported to me. The resolution and size fields are ignored, this info being instead extracted by Image::Size in the importer.

* date
* time
* camera_make
* camera_model
* flash_used
* focal_length
* exposure (Exposure and Exposure time headers)
* compression (Jpeg process and JPG Quality headers)
* aperture
* iso_equiv
* metering_mode
* ccd_width
* focus_dist
* comment

===Further Examples===
Below are a couple more examples.

Adding a list of people to a photo (if there are many people it is often faster to do this using the importer rather than through the web ui):

 &gt; zophImport.pl --update --people &quot;Jason Geiger, Virginia Wolfe&quot; dc280/2002.03.14/DCP_0155.JPG

People should be listed left to right, front to back. These people must already be the database. If one of the names could not be found the importer will complain.

Updating all the photos in a directory:

 &gt; find dc280/ -iname &quot;*.jpg&quot; -maxdepth 2 | xargs zophImport.pl --updateSize

You may want to use the --updateSize option like above if you had rotated or resized a bunch of images and wanted to get the correct dimensions into zoph. Specifying a maxdepth prevents the thumbnails from being included.

Starting in version 0.3 of the importer you can also update photos based on their photo_ids rather than names. Say you notice couple sequences of of your photos have an incorrect location. You can see the photo_id for a photos in the url and it may be simpler to update based on that rather than by passing the file names:

 &gt; zophImport.pl --update --useIds --location &quot;Yuka's House&quot; 1562-1571 1580-1585

As of version 0.7, you can influence the way zophImport.pl handles symbolic links.

For example, you have the following files
IMG_0001.JPG, IMG_0002.JPG, both taken 01-01-2007 and LNK_0002.JPG, which is a symlink to IMG_0002.JPG.

If you would import these files with
 zophImport.pl --datedDirs IMG_0001.JPG LNK_0002.JPG

You would have two files in 2007.01.01: IMG_0001.JPG and LNK_0002.JPG - both will be &quot;normal&quot; files. You will also have IMG_0002.JPG, still in it's old location.

If you would import these files with
 zophImport.pl --datedDirs --resolveSymlinks IMG_0001.JPG LNK_0002.JPG

You would have two files in 2007.01.01: IMG_0001.JPG and IMG_0002.JPG - both will be &quot;normal&quot; files. You will also have IMG_0002.JPG, still in it's old location.
===Reducing Thumbnail Size===
Based on a suggestion from Alan Shutko, in version 0.3.1 of zophImport.pl I added +profile &quot;*&quot; to the calls to convert. (And in 0.3.3 I commented out this since for some users multiple thumbnails were being generated for an image. I did not see this problem, maybe it was a shell expansion issue. For most people it probably works so you may want to re-enable this feature.)

From http://www.imagemagick.org/www/convert.html:

&quot;The '+profile &quot;*&quot;' removes any ICM, EXIF, IPTC, or other profiles that might be present in the input and aren't needed in the thumbnail.&quot;

This can result in a significant reduction in file sizes. If you do wish to preserve the profiles, remove this argument to convert.

Also, if you wish to regenerate your thumbnails after this change to save space, you can run a command like this from your image directory:

 &gt; find . -iname &quot;*.jpg&quot; -a -not -name &quot;mid_*&quot; -a -not -name &quot;thumb_*&quot; | xargs zophImport.pl --update --thumbnails

==ZophExport.pl==
Zoph is a dynamic sort of application tied closely to the database. But sometimes you want static html files of your photos to burn to a cd or whatnot. Zoph includes a perl script, zophExport.pl, that lets you easily create static galleries.

There are numerous programs whose focus is to generate these sorts of static photo albums. Though I included a very simple built-in static album generator, zophExport.pl is primarily intended to be used with other scripts. Currently two such programs are supported:

* album (http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/album/)
* BINS (http://bins.sautret.org/) 

Both of these are easy to use and provided customizable interfaces.

Before you run the exporter make sure you configure it to use your database settings and image directory as described in the install doc.
===A Quick Example===

Here is a command that creates an export for use with the album program:

 &gt; zophExport.pl --dir &quot;~/Winter Pics&quot; --format album --category Snow

After the exporter finishes it's up to you to run album. zophExport.pl prints out an example command to run album which you can copy and run as is or update with your own options.

In this simple example all photos placed in the Snow category are exported. Within the &quot;Winter Pics&quot; directory zophExport.pl will have created a directory structure mirroring the album structure in Zoph for the selected photos.

There are only two required arguments: the directory to export to (--dir) which will be created if it does not exist, and the format of the export (--format) which currently must be either &quot;zoph&quot;, &quot;album&quot; or &quot;bins&quot;.
===Selecting Photos===
Fields to search by are specified in the same was as in zophImport.pl. For example, you can say

 &gt; zophExport.pl --dir &quot;~/My Album&quot; --format album --album &quot;Boston Trip&quot; --photographer &quot;Jason Geiger&quot; --field rating=5

Only photos I took on my trip to Boston that I rated 5 or more would be exported. By default subalbums of an album are automatically included (so my &quot;Duck Tour&quot; subalbum is also exported). You can disable this by passing --nosubalbums. The same goes for categories (use --nosubcategories to disable). Most fields match using the equals operator. Two exceptions are rating (which defaults to &gt;=) and description (which defaults to like).

You can probably do most things you want by using this system, especially since you can run zophExport.pl multiple times with different parameters, and even edit the results by hand if you wish, before you run album or bins to generate the galleries.

But if you have a particularly complicated query you want to run you can just pass it in directly using the --sql argument. Your query must select * from the photos table, other than that it can be anything. If you pass a sql statement any other constraint arguments are ignored. Make sure to only pass select statements, the script does no checking to make sure you aren't deleting all your data

Here's a tip if you run a complicated search within Zoph and then want to export only those photos. After you get to the results page open up config.inc.php and set DEBUG to 2. Then reload the results page and you should see two sql queries at the top of the page. Copy the first (the count query) and replace &quot;count(distinct ph.photo_id)&quot; with &quot;ph.*&quot;, append &quot;order by ph.date asc, ph.time asc&quot; and pass this to zophExport.pl using the --sql argument.
===Choosing What to Display===
By default zophExport.pl will export everything about your photos except the last modified time, the rating and the albums or categories in which the photo appears.

To prevent the display of a particular field, use the --noshowFIELD argument. For example: --noshowlocation or --noshowdescription. Passing --noshowexif prevents any exif info from being shown. (Note, however, that the BINS program extracts exif info on its own).

The exporter can translate field labels using the same language files that Zoph uses. Pass --lang /path/to/php/lang/file to enable this option.

By default the exporter creates directories to mirror the structure of the albums in which the exported photos appear. To disable this and have all the photos appear directly under the export dir use the --noalbumdirs flag.
===A Simple Export===
The exporter contains the ability to generate a very simple static gallery. To use the simple exporter, pass --format zoph to zophExport.pl.

There are two advantages to this format. The first is that it requires no additional software. The second is speed. The simple format is much much faster simply because it uses the thumbnails already generated by Zoph whereas album and BINS generate their own. Someone could probably alter album or BINS so that they could reuse the thumbnails.

There's not really any elegant way to change the appearance of the gallery generated by this exporter. To do so you probably would want to edit zophExport.pl. It wouldn't be too difficult to add css support but I didn't. I only wanted to spend so much time reinventing the wheel.
===Exporting to Album===

album is written by David Ljung Madison.
http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/album/

album is a single perl script which requires nothing more than you already have from using Zoph (ImageMagick and Image::Size). A debian package is available.

To use album, specify --format album to zophExport.pl. The exporter will create a captions.txt file in each directory that contains images.

Album is themeable and a number of themes are available from the website. I'd recommend you download a different theme, or create your own, simply because the default theme displays all of the info about a photo on the thumbnails page which can be quite a bit if you include descriptions and exif data. You specify a theme by passing -theme /path/to/theme/dir to album.

===Exporting to BINS===
BINS is written by Jerome Sautret, based on SWIGS, written by Brendan McMahan, which was in turn based on IDS by John Moose.
http://bins.sautret.org/

BINS consists of three perl scripts: an exporter and two image/album description editors. A debian package is available. BINS requires a number of perl modules which you can get from CPAN if you need to.

To use BINS, specify --format bins to zophExport.pl. The exporter will create an image.jpg.xml file for each photo and an album.xml file in each directory.

BINS takes a source directory and a target directory. zophExport.pl will create the target directory based on the --dir you specify. It will also append &quot;.tmp&quot; to the target directory name and create another directory to which it will copy the images from Zoph and which will act as the source dir for BINS. You can remove this temp dir after BINS finishes. You can set the source and target directory to the same dir in BINS but you can only run BINS against that directory once, after that it will start creating thumbnails of the thumbnails, etc.

You can create a config xml file for BINS to use. I found it useful to set the defaultSize parameter to 0 (default to small images).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Cello front side.jpg|thumb|right|Cello]]

This book is all about the '''[[Wikipedia:Cello|cello]]'''! It is meant as a reference text, and will hopefully progress to be the world's first 'encyclopedia'! As this book is still new, a list of potential topics has been placed in the Table of Contents below, covering the obvious basics. However, there is so much to say that this simple preliminary plan could not possibly address everything. 

So, even if you do not have the time to contribute article text, if you do think of a topic area that will be of interest to cellists at any level, please do add it to the table of contents! It will only take a minute! Just click 'edit this page' at the top - the code syntax is dead easy (almost plain text) and is obvious from what is already there.

Now, we all know that the idea of 'correct technique' is often a bitter feud between various schools of cellists. This means it will be very tempting to erase what is already in an article and replace it with something entirely different. As an editing guideline - please do NOT do this. Instead please conform to the Wikipedia convention of [[w:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutrality]] by providing your method as an ''alternative''.

For example, state clearly that &quot;There are three different approaches to this bowstroke&quot;, segregating each explanation to its own paragraph or bullet point. If something is obviously incorrect such as, &quot;The bow is held at the tip&quot; then of course, go ahead and edit. If you are unsure about something, you can always use the 'discuss' link under each page, or the [http://server2.ezboard.com/bcellofun.html Internet Cello Society Forums].

A further editing guideline in regard to the warning box below. Although this is perhaps against the Wiki convention, if you are a beginner cellist, even though your input is of course still absolutely welcome and valued, it may be better to stay away from editing pages concerning technique for the minute. Technique on stringed instruments is very complex, and it takes many years before you know exactly what you are doing and why. 

Even when you think you know exactly where you are heading, it is often the case that it is only an intermediary step, or a 'substitute technique', a stand-in that will do for now while you are working on something else. For this reason, it is suggested that the editing of technical chapters is left to more experienced players, in order to prevent the spread of ideas which may lead to injury. 


{{warning|'''Warning!''' This book is meant as reference material, and is certainly NOT to be used as a substitute for a teacher.  Playing the cello may appear fundamentally simple, but it is in fact a very delicate skill which takes years to master. Everybody is different, and although technique can be generically described, no one explanation is a perfect fit for every cellist. 

A little incorrect technique can quickly lead to bad habits which (a) restrict your ability to progress and (b) may take months to undo, or just as easily, chronic injury. Unlike other instruments such as the guitar or the piano, stringed instruments do not lend themselves to self learning, even at a basic level. &lt;u&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Teaching yourself is not recommended, please don't try it&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/u&gt;.

On the other hand, solid ''classical'' technique for guitar or piano is likewise near impossible to achieve by self-learning.  The popular repertoire for cello is much less than for many instruments, e.g. guitar and piano.  But, it does not have to be so.  The cello can be an awesome instrument in its power and expression.  It is greatly underused in the popular idiom.  If your goal is not to become a Bach virtuoso, by all means pick up the instrument and try it, teacher or not.  There's no point in being a snob about it.}}

===2. Qh5===
This move violates one of the main principles in chess by developing the queen too early. As the e5 pawn is under attack, Black normally defends it with [[/2...Nc6/]], though he may offer it as a gambit in order to obtain a lead in development with 2...Nf6!?

Note that this position allows one of the quickest possible mate for White if Black plays [[/2...Ke7/]] (3. Qxe5#).

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENA 1: Paris, in un centro de conferentias:
Petro parla a John Melville e le accusa de
dishonestemente essayar finger esser un possibile
cliente sue pro extraher ex ille informationes
commercial confidential sur su compania. Petro
deveni multo irate, e John Melville essaya calmar
le, dicente que in le affaires tal practicas es
commun. Gerardo Florette interveni e porta Petro
via, suggerente que illes bibe alique e oblida le
senior Melville.

Petro finalmente vade con Gerardo, ma non sin unes
parolas menaciante a John Melville, qui pare surprendite
e indignante e completemente sin regret pro
lo que ille ha facite. Petro e Gerardo vade a un
parve café in un area de Paris que Gerardo cognosce
ben. Petro se calma e demonstra un certe placer
in le bonhomia del vita in le cafés parisian. Illes
parla sur le conferentia, e le duo es de accordo
que illo es un perdita de tempore. Ni John ni Petro
ha fame, ma illes vole haber un secunde bibita e
continuar lor activitates in un altere parte de
Paris, sin dubita pro continuar lor libationes.

Petro: Eh, senior Melville, io ha unes parolas
a dicer vos.

Melville: Si, e ...

Petro: Vos ha un memoria de me?

Melville: Certemente. Illo nunc reveni a me.
Un volo inter Strasbourg e Geneva.

Petro: Vos non me diceva que vos travaliava pro
nostre competition.

Melville: Vos ha ration.

Petro: E vos ha essayate obtener de me unes
informationes durante que vos fingeva esser un cliente.

Melville: Ascolta. Io vos lassava creder lo que
vos voleva creder. Le commercio es un jungla, e
il pare que vos non comprende su operationes.

Petro: Io debe dar a vos un bon colpo de pugno!

Gerardo: Vamos, Petro. Vamos.

Petro: Como vos dice, nos vive in un jungla. In
tres annos vostre compania essera in bancarupta,
e vos non habera ulle travalio.

Melville: Io crede que il essera vostre compania
que perdera. Nos videra.

Gerardo: Vamos, Petro. Facer un scena hic non
complira ullo. Vamos biber alique.

Petro: Sia multo caute con lo que vos facera in
le futuro, Melville. Vos crede que vos es astute
e intelligente, ma eventualmente vos habera grande
problemas.

Gerardo: Vamos, Petro. Que nos bibe alique.

Melville: Qual es le problema que ille me offere?
Io non le comprende. Io le cognosceva durante un
viage in avion, e io ha demandate unes informationes
sur su travalio. Illo es toto. Io non sape proque
ille ha devenite tan irate.

Petro: Bon, Gerardo. Vos cognosce un bon loco
ubi nos pote biber alique?

Gerardo: Si. Il ha un parve café tranquille multo
vicin a iste loco, al fin del strata.

Petro: Vamos illac.

Gerardo: Ah, omne va multo melio. Tunc vos es
contente de esser in Francia?

Petro: Si, il essera multo bon pro me biber alique
in le terrassa de un café. Io non ha potite facer
illo in Geneva.

Gerardo: Ah, bon. Ma qual esseva le problema?

Petro: Le tempore es troppo frigide. E sovente
il pluve.

Gerardo: Si. Suissa es un pais curiose. E
que pensa vos del conferentia?

Petro: Francamente, io es convincite que io perde
mi tempore in illo.

Gerardo: Vos ha ration. Il non ha ulle nove que
illes offere.

Petro: Si. Illo es un ver perdita de tempore.

Gerardo: Melville pareva espaventate. Io crede
que vos vermente iva batter le.

Petro: Io quasi lo faceva.

Gerardo: Vos vole mangiar alique?

Petro: No.

Gerardo: Anque io non ha fame. Ma io crede que
un altere bibita esserea un bon idea.

Petro: Si. Io ha besonio de calmar mi nervos.

Gerardo: Garson, le mesme cosa. E non mitte tante
aqua iste vice. Ah, Petro, a vostre sanitate!

Petro: E al vostre!

Gerardo: Vos sape, post iste bibita, io crede que
nos debe essayar un altere café. Io cognosce un
altere multo proxime a iste que serve multe cosas
excellente ex le cocina francese.

EXERCITIO 1: Pro ordinar cosas in cafés.

Guida: Eh, ben, io ha le impression que Petro va
haber un vespere interessante. Nunc io volerea
comprender melio le vocabulario que on usa pro
commandar cosas in un café:

Un homine: Bon vespere.

Garson: Que vole vos ordinar?

Un femina: Io volerea un bira, per favor.

Garson: Que typo de bira? Bottilia? Ex le valvula?

Un femina: Bottilia, per favor.

Garson: Brun o clar?

Un femina: Un clar.

Un homine: Quanto a me, io crede que io volerea
un whisky.

Garson: Si?

Un femina: Un bira e un whisky, per favor.

Garson: Vos vole qualque con le whisky? Coca
Cola? Soda? Glacie?

Un homine: Glacie, per favor.

Garson: Le total pro omne illo es trenta-septe
euros.

Un homine: Gratias.

Garson: Gratias.

Un homine: A vostre sanitate.

Un femina: Al vostre.

Guida: Io spera que Petro non bibeva troppo heri
vespere. Ille ha multo a facer hodie.


SCENA 2: Paris, al officios de Trans Infra: Le
matino post lor vespere de biberages, Petro e Gerardo
es un pauco malade, specialmente Petro, e Gerardo
da a ille un pauco de aspirina e un consilio assatis
estranie pro remediar su grandissime dolores de capite.
Post que Petro ha inglutite su aspirina, ille deveni
un pauco minus malade, e un senior Legrand le apporta
a un sala de conferentias e le presenta a unes altere
personas qui travalia pro Trans Infra.

On da a Petro un invitation pro presentar un discussion
sur le projecto de Geneva, e ille accepta. Ille
suggere que illes organisa cata mense reuniones
regular de ingenieros senior de maniera que omnes
pote intercambiar e actualisar le informationes
que illes ha accumulate sur le transporto urban,
addente que cata reunion esserea in un citate europee
differente.

Quando Petro fini su discussion, le senior Legrand
parla sur su opposition al projecto. Ille dice
que ille non pote inviar su ingeniero le plus senior
a un reunion cata mense sin interrumper le travalios
essential de su officio de un maniera inacceptabile.
Ille pote inviar al reunion un ex su ingenieros
plus juvene, ille dice, ma non un veterano. Petro
essaya explicar al senior Legrand le importantia
del presentia del ingeniero le plus senior, ma sin
successo.

Gerardo: Bon die, Petro.

Petro: Bon die, Gerardo.

Gerardo: Como sta in iste momento?

Petro: Non multo bon. E vos?

Gerardo: Non multo melior.

Petro: Ubi es omne le membros de iste conferentia?

Gerardo: In le sala de conferentias apud nos.

Petro: Esque io pote haber un caffe ante vader illac?

Gerardo: Naturalmente.

Petro: E duo tablettas de aspirina?

Gerardo: Aspirina? Io debe haber un bottilia de
tablettas in alicun parte. Ah, ecce illos.

Petro: Gratias. Io spera que illos vos adjuvara.

Gerardo: Inverte vos con le capite in le solo.

Petro: Que?

Gerardo. Pone vostre capite in le solo e vostre
pedes in le aer.

Petro: Inverter me con le capite in le solo? Que
face illo?

Gerardo: Illo vos adjuvara. Omne vostre sanguine
descende verso le capite.

Petro: Illo me pare periculose.

Gerardo: Al contrario. Illo es multo bon.

Petro: No, gratias. Esque vos ...

(Le senior Legrand entra.)

Senior Legrand: Nos vos attende.

Petro: Io vade ibi.

Gerardo: Io vos presenta le senior Legrand.

Senior Legrand: Omnes es in le sala. Nos vos attende.

Gerardo: Bon die, seniores. Ecce Petro Minelli
del projecto de Geneva. Io va seder me e lassar
le parlar.

Petro: Gratias. Eh, ben, como Gerardo vos ha dicite,
io ha venite pro parlar a vos sur le projecto de
Geneva. Io suppone que vos ha apprendite alicun
detalios sur illo.

Senior Legrand: No. Nos non sape ullo sur iste
projecto, e nos spera que vos pote dar nos le detalios
le plus importante sur illo.

Petro: Ah, multo ben. Nostre idea es de establir
un systema de centralisation de informationes in
Geneva. Nos ha un parve centro illac dirigite per
Catherina De Sanctis. Nostre travalio consiste
de centralisar e coordinar informationes general
e specialisate pro omne le projectos de Marex Mundial
e de Trans Infra. Nos anque habera le rolo de un
corpore de consiliatores general pro omne nostre
projectos. Assi nos potera centralisar nostre
capacitates de formar strategias pro responder a
nove conditiones de disveloppamento in areas de
marketing e de technologia. Nos es specialmente
interessate in le technologia nove. Ecce un exemplo:
Si le governamento de un citate nos demanda un
melior systema de transporto urban, nos volera haber
le information pro presentar a illo un grande serie
de optiones includente autobuses, taxis, trams,
trainos subterranee in combinationes efficiente
e economic. Naturalmente, pro presentar un optime
serie de optiones, nos habera un departimento de
recercas cuje informationes essera continuemente
actualisate. Pro adjuvar nos in iste effortios
nos propone reunir nostre personal le plus senior
cata mense in reuniones pro excambiar ideas e
informationes que nostre departimento de recercas
non potera extraher ex le fontes jam establite,
que sovente non ha accesso a informationes
completemente actualisate ...

Senior Legrand: Attende un momento.

Petro: Si?

Senior Legrand: Si io comprende ben, vos vole que
nostre ingenieros principal se reuni cata mense?

Petro: Si. Tal reuniones es un parte importante
de nostre planos. Esque vos non lo sapeva?

Senior Legrand: No. Io justo nunc lo ha apprendite
de vos.

Petro: Eh ben, si. Haber tal reuniones es nostre
intention.

Senior Legrand: Ubi?

Petro: Como?

Senior Legrand: Ubi va occurrer tal reuniones?

Petro: Hmm. Eh ben, on pote discuter lo plus
tarde. Ma nos habeva pensate que iste conferentias
poterea haber loco, pro exemplo, un mense hic, le
proxime mense in Geneva, tunc in London, tunc in
Frankfurt--un serie de reuniones in cata citate.

Senior Legrand: Si io comprende ben, vos vole que
nostre ingenieros principal vade un o duo dies cata
mense a tal reuniones?

Petro: Isto es nostre idea, si.

Senior Legrand: Pro parlar de disveloppamentos
nove?

Petro: Exactemente.

Senior Legrand: Isto es impossibile.

Petro: Impossibile? Proque?

Senior Legrand: Io sape que le projecto de Geneva
es importante. Vos nos ha explicate exactemente
pro que.

Petro: Si, il es multo importante. Io crede que
il non ha ulle dubita de illo.

Senior Legrand. E vos vole que nos pone un de nostre
ingenieros principal a vostre disposition cata mense.

Petro: Si, exactemente.

Senior Legrand: Ma io non pote permitter que mi
ingeniero principal vade a reuniones in omne le
citates de Europa omne le tempore. Il ha troppo
travalio a facer. Vos deberea contentar vos con
un ex nostre ingenieros juvene.

Petro: Io sperava que nos poteva arrivar a un
arrangiamento sur illo.

Senior Legrand: Mi ingenieros senior ha multe travalio
que require lor attention continue. Illes simplemente
non pote vader a vostre reuniones. Le precio esserea
negliger detalios importante de lor travalio.


EXERCITIO 2: Explicar situationes.

Guida: Le viage de Petro a Paris non habeva resultatos
multo favorabile pro ille. Petro habeva multe cosas
a dicer durante iste reunion, e unes ex le cosas
que ille diceva causa problemas. Io volerea practicar
le typo de linguage que on usa in tal situationes.

Un homine: Il es necesse que vos explica le situation
como illo es nunc.

Un femina: Eh, ben, ecce como illo es:

Un homine: Parla nos sur le nove projecto.

Un femina: Nos nunc es al puncto de comenciar un
nove projecto.

Un homine: Parla nos sur le reunion.

Un femina: Lo que es necesse es que nos nos reuni
regularmente.

Un homine: Un vice cata mense in Paris.

Un femina: Lo que es necesse es que nos nos reuni
regularmente in Paris cata mense.

Un homine: Pro discuter nove projectos.

Un femina: Lo que es necesse es que nos nos reuni
regularmente cata mense in Paris pro discuter nove
projectos.

Un homine: Mentiona quando on va discuter iste
detalios.

Un femina: Nos pote arrangiar le questiones de
detalio plus tarde.

Un homine: Probabilemente.

Un femina: Nos pote probabilemente arrangiar le
questiones de detalio plus tarde.

Un homine: Nos potera discuter los.

Un femina: Nos potera discuter questiones de detalio
quando nos nos reuni le proxime vice.

Un homine: In Paris.

Un femina: Nos potera discuter questiones de detalio
quando nos nos reunira le proxime vice in Paris.

Guida: Nos nos reunira de novo in Paris. No. Io
non crede que io saperea parla sur tal cosas--al
minus in iste momento. Ma que nos retorna a Petro,
qui ha volate desde Paris a su officios in Geneva.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: Paris, in a conference center: Peter
speaks to John Melville and accuses him of dishonestly
pretending to be a possible client of his to extract
from him confidential commercial information about
his company. Petro becomes very irate, and John
Melville tries to calm him, saying that in business
such practices are common. Gerardo Florette intervenes
and takes Petro away, suggesting that they have
a drink and forget about Mr. Melville.

Petro finally goes with Gerardo, but not without
directing some menacing words to John Melville,
who seems surprised and indignant and completely
without regrets about what he has done. Petro and
Gerardo go to a small cafe in an area of Paris that
Gerardo knows well. Petro calms down and takes
a certain pleasure in the bonhomie of Paris cafe
life. They talk about the conference, and the two
agree that it is a waste of time. Neither John
nor Petro are hungry, but they want to have a second
drink and continue their activities in another part
of Paris, no doubt to continue their drinking.

Petro: Hey, Mr. Melville, I have some things to
say to you.

Melville: Yes, uh ...

Petro: Do you remember me?

Melville: Certainly. It's coming back to me.
A flight. Between Strasbourg and Geneva.

Petro: You didn't tell me that you worked for our
competition.

Melville: You're right.

Petro: And you tried to get some information from
me by pretending to be a customer.

Melville: Listen. I let you believe what you wanted
to believe. Business is a jungle, and you don't
seem to know how it works.

Petro: I ought to slug you here and now!

Gerardo: Come on, Petro. Let's go.

Petro: As you say, we live in a jungle. In three
years your company will be in bankruptcy, and you
will be out of work.

Melville: I think it will be your company that
will lose. We'll see about that.

Gerardo: Come on, Petro. Making a scene here will
not accomplish anything. Let's go get a drink.

Petro: Be very careful about what you will do in
the future, Melville. You think that you are smart
and astute, but eventually you're gonna have some
big problems.

Gerardo: Come on, Petro. Lets go drink something.

Melville: What is the problem with this guy? I
don't understand him. I got to know him during
a plane trip, and I asked him some questions about
his work. That's all. I don't understand why he's
gotten so mad.

Petro: Okay, Gerardo. Do you know a good place
where we can go drink something?

Gerardo: Yes. There is a small, quiet cafe very
near this place, at the end of the street.

Petro: Let's go there.

Gerardo: Ah, everything's going much better. So
are you happy to be in France?

Petro: Yes, it'll be very good for me to have a
drink at some sidewalk cafe. I haven't been able
to do this in Geneva.

Gerardo: Ah, good. But what was the problem?

Petro: The weather's too cold. And it often rains.

Gerardo: Yeah. Switzerland is a funny country.
And what do you think about the conference?

Petro: Frankly, I'm convinced that I'm wasting
my time there.

Gerardo: You're right. There's nothing new that
they are offering.

Petro: Yeah, it's a real waste of time.

Gerardo: Melville seemed really scared. I think
that you were really gonna hit him.

Petro: I almost did so.

Gerardo: Do you want to eat something?

Petro: No.

Gerardo: I'm not hungry either. But I think that
another drink would hit the spot.

Petro: Yeah. I need to calm my nerves.

Gerardo: Waiter, the same thing. And go easy on
the water this time. Ah, Petro, to your health!

Petro: And to yours!

Gerardo: You know, after this drink, I think that
we ought to try another cafe. I know another one
near here that serves some really good French food.


EXERCISE 1: Ordering things in a cafe.

Guide: Well, I get the feeling that Petro will
be having an interesting evening. Now I'd like
to understand better the vacabulary used for ordering
things in a cafe.

A man: Good evening.

Waiter: What do you want to order?

A woman: I would like a beer, please.

Waiter: What kind of beer? Bottled? Draft?

A woman: Bottled, please.

Waiter: Dark or light?

A woman: Light.

A man: Me, I'd like a whiskey.

Waiter: Yes?

A man: A beer and a whiskey, please.

Waiter: Do you want something with the whiskey?
Coca Cola? Soda? Ice?

A man: Ice, please.

Waiter: The total for all that is thirty-seven
euros.

A man: Thanks.

Waiter: Thanks.

A man: To your health.

A woman: And to yours.

Guide: I hope Peter didn't drink too much yesterday
evening. He has a lot to do today.


SCENE 2: Paris, at the offices of Trans Infra:
On the morning after their evening drinking, Petro
and Gerardo are a little hung over, especially Petro,
and Gerardo gives him some aspirin and some rather
strange advice for taking care of his really bad
headaches. After Petro has taken his aspirin, he
becomes a little less sick, and a Mr. Legrand takes
him to a conference room and presents him to some
other people who work for Trans Infra.

Peter is given an invitation to present a discussion
on the Geneva project, and he accepts. He suggests
that every month they hold regular meetings of senior
engineers so that everyone can exchange and update
the information they have accumulated on urban
transport, adding that each meeting would be in
a different European city.

When Petro finishes his discussion, Mr. Legrand
expresses his opposition to the project. He says
that he can't send his most senior engineer to a
meeting every month without unacceptably interrupting
the essential work at his office. He can send one
of his younger engineers to the meetings, he says,
but not a veteran. Petro tries to explain to
Mr. Legrand the importance of the presence of his
most senior engineer at these meetings, but without
success.

Gerardo: Good morning, Petro.

Petro: God morning, Gerardo.

Gerardo: How're you doing right now?

Petro: Not all that well. And you?

Gerardo: Not much better.

Petro: Where are all the others who are going to
be at this conference?

Gerardo: In the conference room next to us.

Petro: Can I have some coffee before going in there?

Gerardo: Naturally.

Petro: And two aspirin tablets.

Gerardo: Aspirin? I should have a bottle of tablets
somewhere. Ah, here they are.

Petro: Thanks. I hope they'll help you.

Gerardo: You might try standing on your head.

Petro: What?

Petro: Yeah. Stand on your head?

Petro: Stand on my head? What will that to?

Gerardo: It'll help you out. All your blood will
go down to your head.

Petro: That seems dangerous to me.

Gerardo: On the contrary. It helps out a lot.

Petro: No, thanks. By the way, ...

(Mr. Legrand comes in.)

Mr. Legrand: We're waiting for you.

Petro: I'm coming.

Gerardo: I'd like to introduce Mr. Legrand to you.

Mr. Legrand: Everyone is in the conference room.
We're waiting for you.

Gerardo: Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Petro
Minelli of the Geneva project. I am going to take
a seat and let him speak.

Petro: Thanks. Okay, as Gerardo has told you,
I have come to talk to you about the Geneva project.
I suppose you have learned some details about it.

Mr. Legrand: No. We don't know anything about
this project, and we hope that you can tell us about
its most important details.

Petro: Ah, very good. Our idea is to establish
an information-centralization system in Geneva.
We have a small center there led by Catherina De
Sanctis. Our work consists of centralizing and
coordinating general and specialized information
for all the projects of Marex Mundial and Trans
Infra. We also will have a general advisory role
for all our projects. Thus we will be able to
centralize our capabilities for forming strategies
to respond to new conditions of development in areas
involving marketing and technology. We are especially
interested in new technology. Here's an example:
If the government of a city asks for a better system
of urban transport, we want to have the information
for presenting to it large range of options including
buses, taxis, light rail, and heavy rail in cost
effective and efficient combinations. Naturaly,
to present an optimal series of options, we will
have a research department whose knowledge base
will be continually updated. To help us in these
efforts we propose to hold monthly meetings of our
most senior personnel so they can exchange ideas
and information that our research department cannot
extract from the usual sources, which often don't
have access to the latest information ...

Mr. Legrand: Wait a minute.

Petro: Yes?

Mr. Legrand: If I understand correctly, you want
our our principal engineers to meet once a month?

Petro: Yes. Such meetings are an important part
of our plans. Didn't you know that?

Mr. Legrand: No. I've just now found out about
this from you.

Petro: Uh, yes. Holding such meetings is our
intention.

Mr. Legrand: Where?

Petro: What?

Mr. Legrand: Where are you going to hold these
meetings?

Petro: Hmm. Well, we could discuss that later.
But we had thought that these conferences could
take place, for example, here one month, the next
month in Geneva, then in London, then in Frankfurt--a
series of meetings in each city.

Mr. Legrand: If I understand correctly, you want
my chief engineer to go take one or two days out
of each month to go to these meetings?

Petro: That's our idea, yes.

Mr. Legrand: To talk about new developments?

Petro: Exactly.

Mr. Legrand: This is impossible.

Petro: Impossible? Why?

Mr. Legrand: I know that the Geneva project is
important. You have explained to us exactly why.

Petro: Yes, it is very important. I think there
is no doubt about that.

Mr. Legrand: And you want us to put one of our
principal engineers at your disposal each month.

Petro: Yes, exactly.

Mr. Legrand: But I can't allow my principal engineer
to go to meetings in all the cities of Europe all
the time. There is too much work to do. You should
content yourself with one of our junior engineers.

Petro: I was hoping that we could arrive at some
arrangement about that.

Mr. Legrand: My senior engineers have a lot of
work that requires their ongoing attention. They
simply cannot go to your meetings. The cost would
be neglecting some important details of their work.


EXERCISE 2: Explaining situations.

Guide: Petro's trip to Paris did not have very
favorable results for him. Petro had a lot of things
to say during this meeting, and some of the things
he said caused a few problems. I would like to practice
the type of language that people use in these
situations.

A man: It is necessary for you to explain the
situation as it is now.

A woman: Okay, here is how it is:

A man: Tell us about the new project.

A woman: We are now about to start a new project.

A man: Tell us about the meeting.

A woman: What is needed is for us to meet regularly.

A man: Once a month in Paris.

A woman: What is needed is for us to meet regularly
once a month in Paris.

A man: To discuss new projects.

A woman: What is needed is for us to meet regularly
once a month in Paris to discuss new projects.

A man: Mention when the details will be discussed.

A woman: We can arrange questions of detail later
on.

A man: Probably.

A woman: We can probably arrange questions of detail
later on.

A man: We will be able to discuss them.

A woman: We will be able to discuss questions of
detail when we meet next.

A man: Where? In Paris?

A woman: We will be able to discuss questions of
detail when we meet next in Paris.

Guide: We will meet once again in Paris No. I
don't think that I could speak about such things,
at least not at this moment. But let's return to
Petro, who has flown from Paris to his offices in
Geneva.

ubi Liliana, le assistente de Catherina, ha un message
de Alicia pro ille. Alicia annuncia que illa tosto
essera in Geneva, ubi illa recomenciara su travalio
como su secretaria. Petro es multo enoiate e demanda
a Liliana si illa sape usar un telex. Liliana responde
que le machina non debe esser non troppo difficile a
usar, e Petro dicta un message pro Alicia, indicante
breve ma clarmente que ille non vole que illa veni
a Geneva. Post unes parve difficultates, Liliana
comencia le transmission del message, e Petro es
multo plus felice.

Liliana: Oh, senior Minelli?

Petro: Si?

Liliana: Il ha un message pro vos.

Petro: Ah, si?

Liliana: Un momento. Io poneva le papiro hic,
ma io non sape exactemente ubi illo nunc est.

Petro: Que es illo?

Liliana: Illo veni de un senioretta Martini, Alicia
Martini.

Petro: E que voleva illa?

Liliana: Ecce le message: &quot;Non cerca un secretaria

Liliana: Venerdi.

Petro: Oh, no!

Liliana: Per telephono.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: We find Peter once again in the Geneva
offices, where Liliana, Catherina's assistant, has
a message from Alicia for him. Alicia says that
she will soon be in Geneva, where she will resume
her work as his secretary. Petro is very annoyed
and asks Liliana if she knows how to use a telex.
Liliana answers that the machine should not be too
difficult to use, and Petro dictates a message for
Alicia, indicating briefly but clearly that he doesn't
want her to come to Geneva. After a few difficulties,
Lilian starts transmitting the message, and Petro
is much happier.

Liliana: Oh, Mr. Minelli?

Petro: Yes?

Liliana: There's a message for you.

Petro: Oh is there?

Liliana: Just a minute. I put it here, but I don't
know exactly where it is at the moment.

Petro: What is it?

Liliana: It comes from a Miss Martini, Alicia Martini.

Petro: And what did she want?

Liliana: Here's the message: &quot;Don't look for a
new secretary. I will be arriving very soon in
Geneva to continue my work with you.&quot;

Petro: When did you get it?

Liliana: Friday.

Petro: Oh, no!

Liliana: By phone.

Petro: Good. Listen. Liliana. Do you know how
to use a telex?

Liliana: I think I could use it.

Petro: It isn't difficult. Can you send this telex
to our offices in Strasbourg? Here's the the number
of the telex.

Liliana: Okay.

Petro: The telex goes to Miss. Martini, em, ay,
are, tea, I en I. Fine. Here's the text: &quot;To
the attention of Alicia Martini, Personnel Office,
very urgent:&quot;

Liliana: Just a minute please. Okay, I've got
it.

Petro: Here's the message: &quot;Don't come to Geneva,
repeat, don't come ...&quot; No, that's not gonna work.
What have you written up to now?

Liliana&quot; &quot;Senioretta Alicia Martini, Personnel
Office, very urgent:&quot;

Petro: Yes, very good. Here's the message:
&quot;Unfortunately we have already selected a new
secretary. There is no work for you in Geneva.&quot;
I hope that she gets this before ...

Liliana: Pardon?

Petro: Nothing, nothing. What have you written?

Liliana: &quot;Unfortunately we have already selected
a new secretary. There's no work for you in Geneva.&quot;

Petro: Perfect. Continue: &quot;Stay in Strasbourg.
Don't come to Geneva. Wait until I give you further
details.&quot;

Liliana: &quot; ... until I give you further details.&quot;

Petro: And sign the message with my name, &quot;Petro.&quot;

Liliana: Petro.

Petro: Can you send it out immediately?

Liliana: I'll try. I think I ought to put the
paper in the machine like this.

Petro: Like that?

Liliana: Yes, I think that it should be like that.

Petro: Try it out.

Liliana: The machine isn't working

Petro: Possibly it is busy. Try once again. Ah,
it is responding. It's responding. Bravo, Liliana.
Thanks.

Liliana: It was a pleasure.


Exercise 3: Describing positions in space.

Guide: I wonder if Petro's telex will arrive soon
enough to keep Alice from going to Geneva. In any
case, I think it would be interesting to get to
know her. In the meantime, I would like to review
a bit the words that show where a person or a thing
can be found.

A man: Here's an automobile. It is an English
automobile.

A woman: Then the seat for the driver is ...

A man: ... to the right. And the seat for the
passenger is ...

A woman: ... to the left.

A man: You are driving the car and are seated to
the right. I am the passenger.

A woman: You are seated to the left.

A man: In England, traffic travels on the left.

A woman: And in continental Europe, traffic goes
to the right.

A man: Good. This automobile has four wheels.

A woman: Two to the right.

A man: Two to the left.

A woman: The total then is four.

A man: Two in front.

A woman: Two in back.

A man: The total is four.

A woman: And the engine it is ...

A man: ... in front.

A woman: And valises? Where are they put?

a man: In the back, in the trunk.

A woman: Or maybe on the roof.

A man: On the roof of the car.

A woman: Fine, and the transmission of the car,
where it it?

A man: There, between the two seats, between the
motor and the back wheels.

A woman: But wait. And the driver?

A man: It is you who are driving the car. You
are the driver. And you are ...

A woman: ... behind the wheel.

Guide: Very well. Let's now return to Petro.


SCENE 4: The offices of Geneva: Petro is with
Catherina. He is very worried about the possibility
that Alice will soon come to Geneva if she didn't
get his telex. Catherina sympathizes, but she adds
that for her it would be interesting to get to know
Alice a little. Petro then shows Catherina a
classified ad for a position in Mexico.

He thinks that he doesn't have enough to do in Geneva,
and he tells Catherina that he is actively considering
the possibility of applying for the position. He
wants to know if she will give him a reference,
and she replies that she would not have any difficulty
in recommending him for the position.

Petro: Oh, God. It seems that Alicia is now coming
to Geneva. She's no doubt gonna come tomorrow and
start organizing everything I do. &quot;Have you signed
your letters? Have you had lunch? Have you called
up our offices in Strasbourg?&quot; Oh, how awful.

Catherina: Were you talking about someone?

Petro: Ah, good morning, Catherina. I didn't see
you.

Catherina: I've heard that we now have two
secretaries.

Petro: What?

Catherina: Yes. There is the new one that you
interviewed a week ago, and there is Alicia.

Petro: Is she here?

Catherina: No, but I have seen her message.

Petro: I have sent her a telex.

Catherina: To ask her to come?

Petro: Good God, no! On the contrary. I told
her to stay in Strasbourg. I said that we already
have a secretary. I hope that that will keep her
from coming, my telex.

Catherina: So she is coming?

Petro: I don't know. I hope not.

Catherina: But I would like to get to know her,
that extraordinary secretary of yours.

Petro: What?

Catherina: I said that I'd like to get to know
her.

Petro: Catherina.

Catherina. Yes?

Petro: Look.

Catherina: What is that?

Petro: A classified ad. I read it on the plane.

Catherina: Let me see it. &quot;We are looking for
an experimental-research engineer with a good
background in urban transportation. The successful
candidate will have the responsibility of planning
a transportation network for a city in Mexico.&quot;

Petro: I think the company is Transportes Mexico.
Go ahead and continue reading the ad.

Catherina: Our company is one of the most important
ones in Latin America concerned with urban planning.
We offer an exceptional salary with excellent work
conditions. Housing provided. Many advantages.
Send your qualifications to ... &quot;

Petro: So, does this job have interesting
possibilities or not?

Catherina: You find the position interesting?

Petro: Listen. There isn't any work here, and
I need something to do.

Catherina: It will come.

Petro: Yes, but when? I really don't want to go
on for a long period of time in an office with nothing
to do.

Catherina: Yes, I understand, naturally.

Petro: And If I told them that the position interested
me, ...

Catherina: Yes?

Petro: ... could you give me a reference?

Catherina: Of course, naturally.

Petro: They are asking for a written reference
of the current supervisor of the candidate. Could
you write a letter of recommendation for me?

Catherina: Certainly. I will do so immediately,
if you want.


EXERCISE 4: Looking for work.

Guida: What were they talking about? A new Job?
I didn't understand very well what they were saying.

First woman: Good. You know what we want.

A man: Go on.

First woman: An electronic engineer for Italy.
The job is in Rome.

A man: What age, more or less?

First woman: That has no importance as long as
the candidate has the experience that we want.

A man: And what do we have to offer?

First woman: A monthly salary of thirteen thousand
euros, good living and work conditions.

A man: I see.

Second woman: Okay, and what can we do for you?

A man: We want to publish a classified ad for finding
an engineer.

Second woman: What?

A man: An electronic engineer. Someone who has
a solid background in electronics.

Second woman: And your other requirements?

A man: An engineer with a background in electronics
who has experience in electronics and who has already
worked in electronics.

Second woman: A background in electronics. I
understand. To work where?

A man: The job is in Rome.

Second woman: And what exactly does that mean?

A man: The office is in Rome. The person we hire
will have to travel at times to work in other regions
of Italy.

Second woman: In Rome. I understand. And the
salary?

A man: The salary will be thirteen thousand euros
a month.

Guide: Good. I know what they want. Let's now
go to Petro for further information about the
possibilities of his new job.

Petro parla con Catherina sur su viage a Paris.
Lo que ille ha a dicer es multo discoragiante.
Ille reporta que le conferentia esseva un fiasco
e que le reunion con le personal de Trans Infra
esseva etiam pejor. Ille explica como le senior
Legrand non permittera que su ingeniero senior vade
a reuniones mensual trans Europa. Il es obvie que
Catherina cognosce Legrand, e illa decide resolver
le problema immediatemente. Illa telephona Roberto
Demur e describe a ille le problema con Legrand.

Demur appoia le position de Catherina e suggere
que illa parla directemente con Legrand. Illa tunc
parla con ille e simplemente demanda que ille invia
su ingeniero senior a Geneva lunedi le tertie die
del mense con su passaporto in ordine. Legrand
dice que ille facera lo que Catherina vole. Petro
es multo impressionate con le autoritate e le
competentia de Catherina e la invita a dinar con
ille. Illa dice que illa volerea acceptar su
invitation ma que illa ha troppo a facer.

Catherina: Petro, vos vole quitar nos pro prender
un altere position. Si io comprende ben, vos non
es felice in Geneva?

Petro: Si, vos ha ration.

Catherina: Pro que ha vos iste sentimentos? Que
ha passate in Paris?

Petro: Paris? Illo esseva horribile.

Catherina: Qual esseva le problema?

Petro: Io habeva difficultates con le hotel, e
le presentation de Infomat esseva un perdita de tempore,
ni plus ni minus.

Catherina: Ah, bon?

Petro: Ma le factor le plus discoragiante esseva
que le reunion del commission de liaison compliva
absolutemente nihil.

Catherina: Ma como?

Petro: Omne lo que nos pote obtener de Paris es
un ingeniero juvene, un comenciante. Probabilemente
un graduato recente con nulle experientia.

Catherina: Ma pro que?

Petro: Illes refusa lassar que lor ingeniero senior
dedica un die ex cata mense a nostre reuniones.
Il pare que il ha troppo travalio in Paris e que
lor ingeniero senior es troppo preciose.

Catherina: Qui ha dicite illo?

Petro: Un certe Legrand.

Catherina: Ah, si, Henrique Legrand. Il ha sempre
problemas con ille.

Petro: Vos le cognosce?

Catherina: Si, io ha travaliate brevemente con
ille diverse vices.

Petro: Tunc vos cognosce le causa de mi frustration.

Catherina: Io regretta multo le difficultates que
vos ha habite con ille, e io va remediar los
immediatemente.

Petro: Que va vos facer?

Catherina: Io va telephonar Paris.

Petro: Esque il vos enoiarea si io audiva le
conversation?

Catherina: No, al contrario.

Catherina: Hallo? Esque io poterea parlar al senior
Dumar? Si, io es Catherina De Sanctis. Roberto?
Io es Catherina. Multo ben, gratias. E vos? Eh
ben, nos ha completate hic quasi omne le organisation
de nostre officio in Geneva, ma usque nunc nos non
ha habite ulle travalio. E Paris nos offere un
difficultate multo frustrante. Henrique Legrand
non vole permitter que su ingeniero senior assiste
al reuniones de nostre commission. Eh ben, Petro
Minelli, nostre ingeniero experte esseva in Paris
venerdi, e Henrique insiste que su ingeniero principal
ha troppo a facer pro perder su tempore in nostre
reuniones. Si, anque io. Esque io debe parlar
a Henrique Legrand, o esque vos prefere facer lo?
Multo ben, io parlara con ille. ... Hallo? Le officio
del senior Legrand, per favor. Hallo? Henrique?
Io es Catherina De Sanctis, de Geneva. Henrique,
qual es le nomine de vostre ingeniero principal?
Roberti? Bon. Per favor, nos ha besonio de su
presentia in le reunion de nostre commission lunedi
le tres de iste mense. Ille es un membro del
commission de liaison. No, nos ha besonio de ille
mesme e non de ulle altere ingeniero. Multo ben,
io crede que nos nos comprende. Gratias, Henrique.
A revider.

Petro: Deo mie, vos esseva impressionante.

Catherina: Que diceva vos?

Petro: Vos esseva phantastic.

Catherina: Io cognosce multo ben Roberto Dumar.
Nos ha travaliate in multe projectos importante,
e con su appoio le cosa esseva facile.

Petro: Esque ille es le chef de operationes in
Paris?

Catherina: Si. Ille es multo competente e anque
multo sympathic.

Petro: Si, assi ille pareva. Catherina, io volerea
demandar si vos pote ...

Catherina: Si?

Petro: Que face vos iste vespere? Nos poterea
dinar conjunctemente.

Catherina: Ah, vos es multo gentil, ma ...

Petro: Nos poterea vader al theatro o al cinema,
como vos vole.

Catherina: Vermente, Petro, illo me placerea multo,
ma iste vespere io non pote facer lo.

Petro: Ah, bon.

Catherina: Io lo regretta multo.

Petro: Oh, non vos preoccupa. Illo esseva solmente
un parve idea mie.

Catherina: Si, e un idea multo bon!

Petro: Tunc forsan nos potera facer isto plus tarde.

Catherina: Si, naturalmente.


EXERCITIO 5: Parlar sur eventos.

Guida: Io ha comprendite multo ben lo que Petro
ha dicite sur le eventos de su viage a Paris, ma
io volerea revider unes ex le manieras de describer
los.

Un homine: Parla me sur vostre viage del septimana
passate.

Un femina: Nos vadeva a Paris. Il esseva le prime
vice que io vadeva illac. Nos pernoctava in un
hotel multo parve.

Un homine: Como esseva le hotel?

Un femina: Illo esseva multo agradabile e quasi
in le centro de Paris. Le jentaculos del hotel
esseva multo bon.

Un homine: Que faceva vos quando vos esseva in

Un femina: Nos vadeva a nostre officio in Paris,
e nos participava in discussiones sur nostre nove

E nos visitava unes sitos touristic.

Un homine: E como esseva omne isto?

Un femina: Illo esseva multo interessante.

Guida: Ben. Que nos continua con le historia.


SCENA 6: Le officio de Geneva: Petro vade a vider
Catherina in su officio. Quando illa le vide, illa
memora que Petro voleva que illa scribeva un littera
de referentia pro ille, e illa dice que illa regretta
non haber lo scribite.

Petro tamen essaya invitar Catherina a dinar o forsan
solmente haber un bibita con ille. Durante que
illes explora le possibilitates, Liliana les
interrumpe, dicente que Alan Tanner essayava parlar
con illa per telephono tres vices, ma Catherina
non esseva in le officio. Liliana tunc narra le
detalios del message de Alan Tanner, dicente que
ille ha trovate un restaurante multo bon ubi illes
poterea vader a dinar, e que a ille placerea que
illa portava le mesme roba que illa habeva portate
le sabbato previe.

Le telephono tunc sona un altere vice, e Catherina
responde (Liliana pensa que il es Alan qui parla.)
Illa narra a Petro le detalios del relationes inter
Alan e Catherina. Petro responde de un maniera
multo breve, indicante possibilemente que ille es
enoiate. Ma Catherina retorna e dice que illa ha
parlate con Alicia, qui diceva que illa habeva
comenciate su viage a Geneva.

Petro: Esque io pote entrar?

Catherina: Si, certemente, Petro. Vos voleva parlar
con me?

Petro: No, non specialmente. Io non ha ullo a

Catherina: Vos vole un caffe?

Petro: No, gratias.

Catherina: Oh, Petro, il ha alique que io regretta

Petro: Que es?

Catherina: Ille littera a Mexico.

Petro: Si?

Catherina: Vos voleva que io scribeva un littera

Petro: Oh, il non es necesse que vos lo scribe

Catherina: Io facera un effortio special pro scriber

Petro: Gratias, Catherina. E pro dinar iste vespere?

Catherina: Infelicemente nos non pote facer lo
hodie.

Petro: Ma possibilemente nos poterea biber alique
post clauder le officios hodie.

Catherina: Ma io non sape exactemente a que hora
io ...

Liliana: Senioretta De Sanctis? Oh, vos es occupate.

Catherina: No. Nos non face ullo importante,
Liliana. Entra. Que vole vos?

Liliana: Eh ben, vos sape, le senior Tanner, del
officio vicin?

Catherina: Si?

Liliana: Ille ha telephonate tres vices, ma vos
non esseva in le officio.

Catherina: Ah, si, gratias.

Liliana: Ille dice que ille vos videra a septe
horas.

Catherina: Multo ben.

Liliana: Ille dice que ille ha trovate un bon
restaurante pro dinar--melior que le ultime sabbato.

Catherina: Ah bon, multo ben.

Liliana: E ille demanda ...

Catherina: Si?

Liliana: ... si vos poterea portar le mesme roba
que vos portava le ultime sabbato.

Catherina: Multo ben. Gratias, Liliana.

Petro: Ah, nunc io comprende.

(Le telephona sona.)

Catherina: Ah, le telephono.

Liliana: Forsan Alan vole parlar con vos.

Catherina: Probabilemente. Io parlara con ille.

Liliana: Io crede que le senioretta De Sanctis
e le senior Tanner es ...

Petro: Si?

Liliana: ... eh, ben ... amicos multo bon.

Petro: Ah si?

Liliana: Illes vadeva via le venerdi e sabbato

Liliana: E ille la ha telephonate tres vices hodie.

Petro: Si, io lo sape. Vos jam me lo ha dicite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: The offices in Geneva: In this scene
Petro talks with Catherina about a trip to Paris.
What he has to say is very discouraging. He reports
that the conference was a fiasco and that the meeting
with the Trans Infra personnel was even worse.
He explains how Mr. Legrand would not allow his
senior engineer to go to the monthly meetings
throughout Europe. It is obvious that Catherina
knows Legrand, and she decides solve the problem
immediately. She calls up Roberto Demur and describes
to him the problem with Legrand.

Demur supports Catherina's position and suggests
that she talk directly with Legrand. She then talks
to him and simply asks him to to send his senior
engineer to Geneva on Monday the third day of the
month with his passport in order. Legrand says
that he will do what Catherina wants. Petro is
very impressed with Catherina's authority and
competence and invites her out to dinner. She says
that she would like to accept his invitation but
that she has too much to do.

Catherina: Petro, you want to leave us to take
another job. If I understand correctly, you are
not happy in Geneva?

Petro: Yes, you're right.

Catherina: Why do you feel like that? What happened
in Paris?

Petro: Paris? It was horrible.

Catherina: What was the problem?

Petro: I had difficulties with the hotel, and
Infomat's presentation was a waste of time, neither
more nor less.

Catherina: Oh, yeah?

Petro: But the most discouraging factor was the
the liaison commission meeting accomplished absolutely
nothing.

Catherina: What do you mean?

Petro: All that we can get from Paris is a young
engineer, a beginner. Probably a recent graduate
with no experience.

Catherina: But why?

Petro: They refuse to let their senior engineer
dedicate one day out of each month to our meetings.
It seems that there is too much work in Paris and
that their senior engineer is too important.

Catherina: Who said that?

Petro: A certain Legrand.

Catherina: Oh, yeah, Henrique Legrand. There are
always problems with him.

Petro: You know him?

Catherina: Yes, I have worked briefly with him
several times.

Petro: Then you know the cause of my frustration.

Catherina: I'm very sorry about the difficulties
you have had with him, and I am going do something
about them right now.

Petro: What are you going to do?

Catherina: I'm gonna phone Paris.

Petro: Would it bother you if I heard the
conversation.

Catherina: No, on the contrary.

Catherina: Hello? Can I speak with Mr. Dumar?
Yes, I'm Catherina De Sanctis. Roberto? It's me,
Catherina. Very well, thanks. And you? Fine,
we have finished almost all of the organization
of our Geneva office, but up to now we haven't had
any work. And Paris is giving us hard time. Henrique
Legrand does not want to let his senior engineer
go to our commission meetings. Okay, Petro Minelli,
our expert engineer, was in Paris Friday, and Henrique
insists that his principal engineer has too much
to do to waste his time at our meetings. Yes, me
too. Should I speak to Henrique Legrand, or do
you prefer to do so? ... Hello? Mr. Legrand's office
please. Hello? Henrique? I am Catherina De Sanctis,
of Geneva. Henrique, what is the name of your
principal engineer? Roberti? Good. Please, we
need him to come to the meeting of our commission
Monday the third of this month. He is a member
of the liaison commission. No, we need him in person
and no other engineer. Very good. I think we
understand each other. Thanks, Henrique. See you
later.

Petro: Good God, that was impressive.

Catherina: What did you say?

Petro: You were fantastic.

Catherina: I know Roberto Dumar very well. We
have worked on many important projects, and with
his support the thing was easy.

Petro: Is he the chief of operations in Paris?

Catherina: Yes. He is very competent and also
very nice.

Petro: Yes, so he seemed. Catherina, I would like
to as you if you can ...

Catherina: Yes?

Petro: What are you doing this evening? We could
go out and eat dinner together.

Catherina: Ah, that's very nice, but ...

Petro: We could go to the theater or to the movies,
as you prefer.

Catherina: Really, Petro, I'd really like to, but
this evening I can't.

Petro: Oh, okay.

Catherina: I'm very sorry about that.

Petro: Oh, don't worry. It was just a little idea
of mine.

Ctherina: Yes, and a very good one!

Petro: So perhaps we can do this later on?

Catherina: Yes, of course.


EXERCISE 5: Speaking about events:

Guide: I understood very well what Peter said about
the events of his trip to Paris, but I would like
to review some of the ways of describing them.

A man: Tell me about your trip last week?

A woman: We went to Paris. It was the first time
I went there. We spent the night at a very small
hotel.

A man: How was the hotel?

A woman: It was very nice and almost in the center
of Paris. The hotel breakfasts were very good.

A man: What did you do while you were in Paris?

A woman: We went to our office in Paris, and we
participated in discussions about our new project.

A man: Did you also do some other things while
you were in Paris?

A woman: Yes, we went a couple of times to the
theater. And we saw some sites for tourists.

A man: And how was all that?

A woman: It was very interesting.

Guide: Okay. Let's continue with the story.


SCENE 6: The Geneva Office: Petro goes to see
Catherina in her office. When she sees him, she
remembers that Petro wanted her to write a letter
of reference for him, and she says that she is sorry
that she hasn't written it.

Petro, however, tries to invite Catherina to go
out to eat or perhaps have a drink with him. While
they explore the possibilities, Liliana interrupts
them, saying that Alan Tanner tried to get through
to her on the phone three times, but Catherina wasn't
in the office. Liliana then gives out the details
of Alan Tanner's message, saying that he has found
a very good restaurant where they could go to eat,
and that he would like her to wear the same dress
that she wore the previous Saturday.

The phone then rings once again, and Catherina answers
(Liliana thinks that it is Alan on the line.) She
tells Petro about the details of the relationship
between Alan and Catherina. Petro answers very
briefly, indicating that possibly he is annoyed.
But Catherina comes back and says that she has talked
with Alicia, who said that she had started her trip
to Geneva.

Petro: Can I come in?

Catherina: Yes, certainly, Petro. You wanted to
talk with me?

Petro: No, not especially, I don't have anything
to do. That is all.

Catherina: Do you want some coffee?

Petro: No, thanks.

Catherina: Oh, Petro, something has come up that
I am very sorry about.

Petro: What is it?

Catherina: That letter to Mexico.

Petro: Yes?

Catherina: You wanted me to write a letter of
recommendation. I completely forgot about it.

Petro: Oh, you don't have to do it right now.

Catherina: I'll make a special effort to do it
tomorrow.

Petro: Thanks, Catherina. And what about going
out to eat this evening?

Catherina: Unfortunately, we can't do so today.

Petro: But possibily we could go out and have a
drink after closing up the offices today.

Catherina: But I don't know exactly what time I'm
...

Liliana: Miss De Sanctis? Oh, you're busy.

Catherina: No. We aren't doing anything important,
Liliana. Come on in. What do you want?

Liliana: Uh, you know, Mr. Tanner, in the next
office?

Catherina: Yes?

Liliana: He's called three times, but you weren't
in the office.

Catherina: Oh, yes, thanks.

Liliana: He said he'll see you at seven o'clock.

Catherina: Fine.

Liliana: He says that he has found a nice restaurant
to eat in--better than last Saturday.

Catherina: Ah, good, very good.

Liliana: And he is asking ...

Catherina: Yes?

Liliana: ... if you could wear the same dress that
you wore last Satudray.

Catherina: Very good. Thanks, Liliana.

Petro: Ah, I understand now.

(The phone rings.)

Catherina: Oh, the phone.

Liliana: Maybe Alan wants to talk to you.

Catherina: Probably. I'll talk with him.

Liliana: I think that Miss De Sanctis and Mr. Tanner
are ...

Petro: Yes?

Liliana: ... uh, you know, very good friends.

Petro: Oh, yeah?

Liliana: They went out together last Friday and
Saturday, the two of them.

Petro: Really?

Liliana: And he called her up three times today.

Petro: Yes, I know. You already told me.

Liliana: It is good for her. She is completely
alone. And you, are you married?

Petro: Me? No.

Catherina: By the way, uh, your telex arrived too
late.

Petro: My telex? The telex that I sent to Strasbourg?

Catherina: Yes.

Petro: You mean to say that Alice ...

Cathierna: She is the one who phoned. She's now
coming here.

Petro: Oh, no. That can't be true.

Guide: Finally, it seems that we are going to get
to know Alice. Lets listen and find out what's
happening.

sedite in un cafe in Geneva. Ille es multo nervose
e preoccupate a causa de Alicia. Catherina essaya
calmar le. Finalmente illa dice a ille que Alicia
telephonava ex le aeroporto de Strasbourg. Catherina
tunc diceva que illa diceva a Alicia que tosto ille
vaderea a Mexico pro un altere position e que pro
illa il esserea inutile volar a Geneva.

Iste information calma Petro, naturalmente, e ille
invita Catherina a prender un altere bibita con
ille pro celebrar iste bon nova. Catherina tamen
responde que illa ha multo a facer, e Petro remane
in le cafe pro biber un altere bira sin illa.

Le garson: Que vole vos, senior?

Petro: Eh, un bira, per favor, e io attende un
altere persona qui volera alique plus tarde.

(Catherina arriva.)

Catherina: A, ecce vos!

Petro: Pardono? Oh, il es vos.

Catherina: Proque vos cela vos in iste angulo del

Catherina: Non vos preoccupa. Calma vos.

Petro: Io essaya facer illo, ma il es difficile.
Que vole vos biber?

Catherina: Eh, io vole solmente un pauco de succo
de orange.

Petro: Si. Garson! Garson! Esque vos pote portar
nos un bicario de succo de orange? Gratias.

Le Garson: Si, senior, immediatemente.

Petro: Gratias. Tunc, que ha passate exactemente?

Catherina: Ascolta, e calma vos. Il es inutile
excitar vos.

Petro: Illo es multo facile a dicer. Ma que sentirea
vos si vos esseva in mi loco?

Catherina: Illo es difficile, io sape. Ma Alicia
solmente essaya adjuvar vos.

Petro: Deo mie! Como esserea le cosas si illa
habeva intentiones maligne?!

Catherina: Illa non sape que vos non vole le typo
de adjuta que illa vos offere. Il non es sempre
facile acceptar le veritate.

Petro: Ma ubi es illa in iste momento?

Catherina: In Strasbourg.

Petro: Ubi?

Catherina: In le aeroporto. Illa ha telephonate
ex le aeroporto pro dicer que illa iva venir hic
a Geneva. Io tunc diceva a illa que illa remane
illac.

Le Garson: Ecce: Un bira pro le senior, e un succo
de orange pro le seniora.

Petro: Gratias.

Catherina: Gratias. Mmm. Illo es deliciose, iste
succo de orange.

Petro: Si, e anque mi bira. Tunc il es ver que
vos ha prevenite que Alicia veni a Geneva.

Catherina: Exactemente.

Petro: Ma como lo ha facite vos?

Catherina: Io ha dicite a illa que tosto vos va
partir ex Geneva?

Petro: Que?

Catherina: Io ha dicite a illa que vos habeva le
intention de vader travaliar in Mexico e que il
es inutile que illa veni a Geneva proque ante multe
tempore vos essera in Mexico.

Petro: Genial. Absolutemente genial!

Catherina: Ma non tan genial. Illo es le veritate.

Petro: E que ha dicite illa?

Catherina: Illa ha dicite que in ille caso illa
non venirea a Geneva.

Petro: Fantastic! Assi illa remane in Strasbourg.
Que relevamento pro me!

Catherina: Vos nunc pote relaxar vos un pauco.
Le periculo ha disparite.

Petro: Catherina, vos es extraordinari. Vos me
ha salvate le vita.

Catherina: Oh, vos exaggera multissimo.

Petro: Io vole un altere bira pro celebrar illo.
E vos, es que io pote comprar vos alique? Un altere
succo de orange? O esque vos prefere alique
differente?

Catherina: No, gratias. Io debe retornar al officio
multo tosto.

Petro: Oh, qual es le prenomine del senior Tanner?

Catherina: Alan.

Petro: Ah, si, io nunc me rememora.

Catherina: Bon, io debe vader via nunc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: Geneva, a cafe: Catherina finds Petro
seated in a cafe in Geneva. He is very nervous
and worried because of Alicia. Catherina tries
to calm him down. Finally she tells him that Alicia
called from the Strasbourg airport. Catherine then
said that she told Alicia that he would soon be
going to Mexico for another job and that it would
be useless for her to fly to Geneva.

This information calms Peter down, naturally, and
he invites Catherina to have another drink with
him to celebrate this piece of good news. Catherina,
however, says that she has a lot to do, and Petro
remains in the cafe to have another drink without
her.

Waiter: What would you like, sir?

Petro: Uh, a beer, please, and I am waiting for
somebody else who will want something a little later.

(Catherina comes in.)

Catherina: Ah, there you are!

Petro: Oh, it's you.

Catherina: Why are you hiding in this corner of
the cafe?

Petro: Where's Alicia. I hope she isn't with you.

Catherina: Don't worry. Calm down.

Petro: I'm trying to do that, but it's hard. What
do you want to drink?

Catherina: Oh, I only want a little orange juice.

Petro: Okay. Waiter! Waiter! Can you bring us
a glass of orange juice? Thanks.

Waiter: Yes, sir, right away.

Petro: Thanks. So what happened exactly?

Catherina: Listen, and calm down. It's useless
for you to get all worked up.

Petro: That's very easy to say. But how would
you feel if you were in my place?

Catherina: It's hard, I know. But Alicia only
wanted to help you out.

Petro: Good God! How would things be if she had
really bad intentions?!

Catherina: She doesn't know that you don't want
the type of help she's offering you. It is not
always easy to accept the truth.

Petro: But where is she right now?

Catherina: In Strasbourg.

Petro: Where?

Catherina: In the airport. She called up from
the airport to say that she was going to come here
to Geneva. I then told her to stay there.

Waiter: Here you are. A beer for the gentleman,
and an orange juice for the lady.

Petro: Thanks.

Catherina: Thanks. Mmm. It is delicious, this
orange juice.

Petro: Yes, and my beer is too. So it is true
that you have kept Alicia from coming to Geneva?

Catherina: Exactly.

Petro: But how did you do it?

Catherina: I told her that you are soon gonna be
leaving Geneva.

Petro: What?

Catherina: I told her that you have the intention
of working in Mexico and that it is useless for
for her to come to Geneva because before too long
you will be in Mexico.

Petro: Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant!

Catherina: But not all that brilliant. It's the
truth.

Petro: And what did she say?

Catherina: She said that in that case she would
not be coming to Geneva.

Petro: Fantastic! So she's gonna stay in Strasbourg.
What a relief for me!

Catherina: You can now relax a little. The danger
has gone by.

Petro: Catherina, you are extraordinary. You have
saved my life.

Catherina: Oh, you're exaggerating a great deal.

Petro: I want another beer to celebrate that.
And you, can I buy you something? Another orange
juice? Or would you like something different?

Catherina: No, thanks. I should go back to the
office pretty soon.

Petro: Oh, what is Mr. Tanner's first name?

Catherina: Alan.

Petro: Ah, yes, yes, I now remember.

Catherina: Good. I've gotta go away now.

Petro: Okay.

Catherina: See you tomorrow.

Petro: See you. I hope you have a nice evening.
And thanks again.

Catherina: Oh, it was a pleasure.


EXERCISE 1: Reporting the words of another person.

Guide: In this scene, Catherina reported what she
had said to Alicia. Liliana repeated to Catherina
her phone conversation with Alan Tanner. In all
languages people do this a great deal. I would
now like to know if I can also do this in Interlingua.

A woman: I'm gonna study Interlingua.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that she's gonna study Interlingua.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that she was gonna study Interlingua.

A woman: I'm not gonna stay in Geneva.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that she's not gonna stay in Geneva.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that she was not gonna stay in
Geneva.

A woman: I'm coming Thursday.

Guide: What did you say?

A woman: I said that I'm coming Thursday.

Guida: What did you say?

A woman: I said that I was gonna come Thursday.

Guide: Ah, I understand.

A woman: He'll be in England very soon.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that he'll be in England very soon.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that he'd be in England very soon.

A woman: I'm gonna send a telex.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that she's gonna send a telex.

Guide: What did she say?

A man: She said that she was gonna send a telex.

Gude: Hmm, I think I understand this type of indirect
discourse much better. Let's continue with our
story.


SCENE 2: The Geneva offices: Francesca Cardano
has arrived, and Catherina shows her the offices
after explaining that Petro is in Frankfurt. Catherina
describes to Francesca the meeting of senior engineers
and explains to her the nature of her work. She
then introduces her to their personnel in Geneva
and shows her where to find everything necessary
for the functioning of the office. She then goes
away, allowing Francesca to get used to her new
work environment.

Francesca: Good morning.

Catherina: Good morning. You are Francesca Cardano?

Francesca: Yes, I am.

Catherina: Welcome to our office.

Francesca: Thank you.

Catherina: Did you have any trouble getting to
our office?

Francesca: No, none.

Catherina: How did you come?

Francesca: On the bus. The trip lasted only fifteen
minutes.

Catherina: Oh, very good. Then you don't know
anyone at this office?

Francesca: I had an interview with Mr. Minelli.

Catherina: Ah, yes, Petro. He's not here today.
He wanted to be here to receive you, but he had
to go to Frankfurt.

Francesca: I see.

Catherina: Yes. We are now forming a technical
commission of engineers.

Francesca: Ah, yes.

Catherina: Petro was in Paris last week to work
on its organization. At this moment he is in
Frankfurt.

Francesca: Yes, I understand. Who are you in contact
with in Germany?

Catherina: With a company called Elektrobahn.
They make electric railway systems.

Francesca: I have the impression that I'm gonna
have to learn a lot of things.

Catherina: Don't worry. It will come fast. The
liaison commission will meet regularly, every month.
One month here, the next month in Paris, after that
in London, then in Frankfurt. If I remember correctly,
you know how to speak German.

Francesca: Yes.

Catherina: And English?

Francesca: Yes.

Catherina: Very good. You will be in charge of
making sure that everyone knows how to get to the
meeting. Everyone will need hotel rooms, updated
files, photocopies, etc.

Francesca: Yes, I understand.

Catherina: And naturally you will learn how to
take care of all our routine affairs.

Francesca: Yes, naturally.

Catherina: You will know all this after a few days
of practice. Good. Where should we start? The
people in this office, perhaps. There's Liliana
over there.

Francesca: Good morning.

Catherina: Liliana is my assistant. And after
her there is Minelli, who you already know. Then
there is Martijn Ockrente, and Olivero Rossi. Martijn
is our service and marketing director, and Olivero
is our accountant. And we also have an assistant
accountant and someone for the computer work, who
will come next week.

Francesca: It seems that there are a lot of people
to get to know!

Catherina: Oh, the office isn't very big. You
will know all of them before too long. Have you
seen the individual offices? Would you like to
see them?

Francesca: Yes, of course.

Catherina: Good. Your office is over there.

Francesca: Okay ...

Catherina: The coffee maker is there. The bathroom
is there. Here's a diagram of all the offices.
Liliana will show you the location of the telex,
the photocopier, and other similar things.

Francesca: Uh, can I ask you your name?

Catherina: Oh, sure. I'm Catherina De Sanctis.

Francesca: Then you are the director?

Catherina: Yes, exactly. Good. Listen. First
I'm gonna let you get to know all the offices a
little. I will come back in an hour more or less,
and you can start your work.

Francesca: Very well. Thank you.

Catherina: See you later.


EXERCISE 2: Introducing someone to a new office.

Guide: I haven't understood everything. The new
secretary seems good, and Catherina has talked to
her about her work. But I would like to practice
a little the different ways of introducing someone
to a new office.

A woman: Is my office over here? Is this the room
where I work?

A man: No. Here's your office over here.

A woman: And supplies like paper, pencils , envelopes
and other similar things?

A man: All that is here, in this cabinet. There
are other similar cabinets in the other offices.

A woman: Ah, I understand. What am I going to
do in my work?

A man: You'll see. Soon you will familiarize yourself
with all this. Among your duties will be opening
letters and packages that come in the mail, sorting
and classifying them, and answering some of them.

A woman: There's a check in this letter. What
should I do with it?

A man: You send it to the assistant accountant
for processing. They will tell you where to put
them.

A woman: And where is the assistant accountant?

A man: His office is next the office of the accountant
himself.

A woman: Good God, I'll need a lot to time to learn
all these details.

A man: Oh no, you will get used to all this very
quickly.

A woman: Yes, but when?

A man: Oh, it'll be a question of just a few days,
nothing more. Soon you will know your various duties
and where to find all of us.

A woman: I hope so.

Guide: It seems that Catherina has said that Petro
was in Frankfurt. Let's see what he is doing there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: The Frankfurt airport and the offices
of Mr. Runde: When the scene starts out, Petro calls
up Mr. Runde, saying that soon he will be in his
office after a short trip in a taxi.

They talk about the Frankfurt airport and wonder
what happened to Sophia, Mr. Runde's secretary,
who was to take Petro to the offices of Elektrobahn
in Frankfurt in a company car. Mr. Runde seems
to be confident that his secretary will come back
soon.

Petro then wants to know if he can speak in Interlingua
during the conference. Mr. Runde says that this
will be possible, especially if he speaks rather
slowly and especially clearly.

They also talk about the length of the meeting,
and Mr. Runde wants to know if there is something
special that Petro needs for his presentation.
Petro answers that he has come with everthing he
needs.

Then Petro says that he would like to get to know
the operations of Elektrobahn a little, and Mr. Runde
says that he will be happy to give Peter a tour
of the offices and the factory of his company after
their meeting.

Petro: Good morning. I'm Petro Minelli. I'm in
Frankfurt at the airport. What? Excuse me, I can't
hear you. Listen, Mr. Runde, I'm in the airport
and soon will be taking a taxi to go to your office.

Mr. Runde: But I've sent Sophia, my secretary,
with a car to bring you to my office. Hasn't she
gotten to the airport?

Petro: I haven't seen her.

Mr. Runde: Poor Sophia.

Petro: I suppose that she'll call you up once she
gets too frustrated from trying to find me.

Mr. Runde: Yeah, that's true. It is very easy
to get lost in an airport. You could look for someone
for an entire week without finding him.

Petro: I've seen a place called the Treffpunkt.
Is this the place where we can run into each other?

Mr. Runde: Yes, but I myself have a hard time finding
passengers at that Treffpunkt. And there are more
than one of those places, and it can be sometimes
very frustrating to use them.

Petro: In the meantime, there's not much that can
be done for your secretary.

Mr. Runde; You're right. There's nothing that
can be done. Sophia will come back to the office
eventually without doubt. If you find a taxi, take
it. It is very easy to lose a lot of time in the
Frankfurt airport.

Petro: One other important thing: Can I speak
in Interlingua at the conference this afternoon?

Mr. Runde: Yes, naturally. All of us speak
Interlingua fairly well. But you will have to speak
slowly and clearly.

Petro: I think that we won't have much trouble
with communication in that case.

Mr. Runde: We haven't had problems with the use
of interlingua in all our meetings up to now.

Petro: The meeting starts at two o'clock, doesn't
it.

Mr. Runde: Yeah. That's right.

Petro: And generally how long do they last?

Mr. Runde: Your part of the meeting will last
generally just an hour. After that, we'll hold
other meetings with our own personnel.

Petro: Yes, I understand. Up to now, I haven't
learned exactly what you do over there. Can you
give me a little tour?

Mr. Runde: Yes, of course. Ah, one other thing:
Do you need anything special for your presentation,
like photocopies of other similar things?

Petro: No, I've got everything that I need on me.

Mr. Runde: Do you have a printed description of
your project?

Petro: No. I'm gonna simply present a broad outline
of the project and explain the program that we've
established for Geneva so that you will be able
to know how to use our new services.


EXERCISE 3: Arranging a meeting with someone.

Guide: I'm wondering what is the best way of arranging
a meeting with someone.

A woman: (Talking on the phone) Wednesday. Wednesday
afternoon. What time does the train arrive? Three
thirty. At the central station. What is the best
place for meeting someone? Under the clock. In
the middle of the station. Yes, that's fine. Three
thirty in the middle of the station. Thanks.

A man: Hello? It's me.

A woman: Good morning. How are you?

A man: Very well, thanks.

A woman: What day will you be getting here?

A man: Wednesday.

A woman: And how're you gonna travel?

A man: By train.

A woman: Can we get together after your trip?

A man: Of course. I can meet you at the main station.

A woman: At what time?

A man: I should be there around three thirty.

A woman: And if the train comes in late?

A man: In that case, can you wait for me?

A woman: Yes, naturally. I'll wait for you at
the exit.

A man: There are many exits.

A woman: Can I wait for you in the restaurant?

A man: There are many restaurants.

A woman: Then where can I wait for you?

A man: Okay, let's meet under the clock.

A woman: Where's the clock?

A man: It's in the middle of the station.

A woman: Very good. I'll see you around three
thirty.

A man: See you then.

A woman: See you.

Guide: I wonder if the German engineers will
understand Petro's Interlingua.

SCENE 4: Frankfurt: A conference room: Petro
speaks to the conference and explains the new system
of planned regular meetings for the principal engineers
of the companies participating in the Geneva project.
He proposes four subject areas for discussion at
these meetings. Once he has finished, Mr. Runde
offers him some coffee and then gives him a tour
of Elektrobahn's offices and of the factory. After
the tour, he invites Petro out for a drink and offers
to show Frankfurt to him. At the end of the scene
they go to the design office.

Petro: Good morning. Unfortunately, I don't speak
German well, but I have been told that you can
understand me if I speak Interlingua.

Mr. Runde: That's true, if you speak slowly and
clearly.

Petro: If I speak slowly and clearly. Very well.
I'm at this meeting to talk to you a little about
the new Marex Mundial project in Geneva. We've
recently set ourselves up there, and we are now
starting out our operations. We want to inaugurate
a system of meetings especially before starting
a new project. But we also want to inaugurate a
system of regular monthly meetings to exchange ideas
and information. The first meeting will be in Geneva,
the second in Paris, the third in London, and the
fourth here in Frankfurt. We will rotate these
meetings the entire year from one of these cities
to another. I propose that we discuss four principal
things. The first will be new technical developments,
which will include new forms of locomotion or new
research on engines and motors, systems of assembly,
etc. The second will be construction, rail and
road installation, and auxiliary systems, such as
systems of security. The third will concern systems
of signal and traffic control. This will include
automated systems and electronic and mechanical
innovations. It is essential that all of us be
aware of new developments, especially the new magnetic
and pneumatic systems and other technological
possibilities in systems of urban transport. In
all these areas, new ideas are born almost weekly.
And to maintain our competitive superiority, we
must always know what is available.

Mr. Runde. Fine.

Petro: Do you have some coffee in this office.

Mr. Runde: Yes, of course. Here it is. You can
serve yourself, if you want.

Petro: Thanks

Mr. Runde: I can now show you our factory, if you
want.

Petro: Yes, thank you very much.

Mr. Runde: We can also visit our planning office.
We have three factories in Germany. The Frankfurt
factory is the largest of ... Here's the machinery
department--essentially high-powered electric motors.
You can see the assembly line over there.

Petro: And these motors are destined for what?

Mr. Runde: Principally for projects in Germany.
This groups here is going to Hanover. Tell me,
where is your hotel?

Petro: Near the railroad station.

Mr. Runde: Shall we go out for a drink this evening?

Petro: Ah, yes, an excellent idea!

Mr. Runde: There are some very nice places in
Frankfurt.

Petro: Oh yeah?

Mr. Runde: I could show you some, if you'd like.

Petro: Oh, yes, I really would. You're very kind.

Mr. Runde: The design office is below. Let's take
a brief look at it.


EXERCISE 4: Inviting someone to go out.

Guide: We have seen that this evening Petro has
gone out for a drink, the way he did in Paris.
Okay. There are ways of inviting people out and
ways of answering yes or no to an invitation. I
would like to hear some of them.

A man: Would you like to go out this evening for
a drink?

A woman: I'm sorry, but I can't do so today.

A man: Really?

A woman: I'm sorry, but I really don't have the
time.

A man: Okay. Perhaps some other day. Maybe tomorrow?

A woman: No, I'm sorry, but I really can't

A man: Perhaps Friday?

A woman: Yes, I don't have anything to do Friday.
Let go out Friday evening.

planification egyptian va arrivar a Geneva le die

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: Petro has returned to Geneva. There he
finds Francesca, who has started her work. He wants
to know if she has had any problems in getting used
to her new work. She answers that everything is
going well enough but that everything will be better
after a few more days of practice. She asks Petro
if his trip to Frankfurt went well. Afterwards
she wants to know when he arrived in Geneva.

Petro then wants to know if Catherina is in her
office and if she is busy. Francesca says that
she's free, and Peter goes in to see her. Catherina
wants to know if the trip to Frankfurt went well,
and Petro gives her the details about their decisions
for the next meeting and about the program that
they have established.

Francesca then interrupts them with an urgent and
mysterious message. She has received on the telex
something that should be of great interest for Petro
and Catherina.

Francesca: Good morning, Mr. Minelli.

Petro Good morning, uh ...

Francesca: Francesca.

Petro: Ah, yes. Francesca. I'm very happy to
see you. It seems that you have now started your
work, and this place now seems like a real office.
How's everything going?

Francesca: Just fine, thanks.

Petro: Have you been able to settle in easily enough?

Francesca: Yes. Everything's gone quite well.
But I need more time to get used to things.

Petro: Naturally. It will take some weeks.

Francesca: Yes.

Petro: Fine Have you had any problems up to now?

Francesca: No, none.

Petro: Ah, perfect.

Francesca: And your trip to Frankfurt, was everything
okay?

Petro: Yes, thanks. Just fine.

Francesca: Did you like the German beer?

Petro: No, this time I drank more wine than beer.

Francesca: And when did you get back to Geneva?

Petro: Oh, this morning. Tell me, is Catherina
in her office?

Francesca: Yes, she's there.

Petro: Do you know if she's busy right now?

Francesca: Uh, no. She's now alone in her office.
You can go in.

Petro: Thanks.

Catherina: Good morning, Petro.

Petro: Good morning, Catherina.

Catherina: Did you have a good trip?

Petro: Yes, very good, thanks.

Catherina: And how was Frankfurt?

Petro: Oh, very good. Things were very nice there.

Catherina: No problems?

Petro: No, no problems.

Catherina: And everything is organized for next
month?

Petro: Yes. Everything has been organized. They
have some very good ideas there. I toured one of
their factories.

Catherina: Oh yeah? I've heard they're really
very good. So how's the organization for the next
meeting?

Petro: Okay, the liaison commission has been formed.
It has four members, which is a good number. A
small commission is much more efficient than a large
one. The first meeting will be here on the third
of the month, or Monday. They will be here for
breakfast, and the meeting will start out afterward.
The agenda for the first meeting is ...

Catherina: Do you have a program?

Petro: Yes, certainly. All of us made it up together.

Catherina: Very good.

Petro: We lost no time at all.

Catherina: Then, what is there on the program?

Petro: Some provisions for the next ten years,
a feasibility study for a centralized evaluation.

Catherina: That's very impressive, all that.
(Francesca comes in.) Yes, Francesca?

Francesca: Excuse me for interrupting you.

Catherina: Don't worry.

Francesca: I have something that you will find
interesting.

Catherina: Oh yeah? What is it?

Francesca: Read this message from the telex.


EXERCISE 5: Polite questions:

Guide: I'd like to know what came in on the telex,
naturally. But in the meantime, I'd like to hear
once again these questions of courtesy.

A man: If someone comes back from a trip, you could
ask ...

A woman: Have you had a good trip?

A man: Oh, just fine, thanks.

Another man: And if this person is coming back
from London, you could ask ...

A woman: How did you like London?

A man: Very nice, but a little expensive.

A woman: Yes, things are expensive there. I myself
am coming back from New York.

A man: What did you think of New York?

A woman: Very interesting. Exhausting, but
fascinating.

A man: Did you do some interesting things there?

A woman: Yes, I really like New York a lot.

A man: Me too.

A woman: I returned by plane.

A man: And the trip, how was it?

A woman: Fine. A little long, naturally, and a
little tiring.

A man: Yes, a trip like that is always very tiring.

A woman: It's nice to return home.

A man: And how's everything going?

A woman: Ah, very well. Everything's going very
well. And for you, how're things going?

A man: Not too bad, thanks.

A woman: Fine.

Guide: Good. Let's find out what there was on
the telex.


SCENE 6: Francesca shows Petro and Catherina the
telex message that has just come in from Cairo.
The Egyptians, it seems, want to build a completely
new city, and the Egyptian planning minister is
going to arrive in Geneva the following day. Catherina
got to know him earlier when they worked together
on a project in Alexandria.

Catherina is rather confident that Marex Mundial
will get the contract. Naturally, Petro also will
have to participate in the meeting when the minister
comes. Petro expresses his confidence that Marex
will get the contract because Marex will be able
to offer the best prices. Their personnel are also
more competent, and they finish their work very
fast.

The phone rings, and Francesca answers. It is Alan
Tanner, who invites Catherina to go out with him.
But she answers firmly that she can't do this and
that it will be better that he not call her up about
personal things because they have nothing further
to discuss.

Petro and Catherina then continue their conversation.
Francesca is going to call up the hotel in Geneva
where the minister is staying, and she is also going
to tell Martijn Ockrente and Olivero Rossi about
the meeting. Peter mentions that he has heard
Catherina's conversation with Alan Tanner, and he
tries to console her, but she does not seem anxious
or angry in any way. Finally, she says that not
all that long ago Peter asked her out for dinner,
and he asks if he can go out with her that evening.

Francesca: There's something that you should see.

Catherina: Oh, yes? What?

Francesca: This telex. Take a look.

Petro: What is it?

Francesca: It came from Egypt, from Cairo.

Petro: What do they want?

Francesca: They're building a new city.

Petro: What?

Francesca: And they want to build a transportation
network for the city.

Catherina: They want a complete study. Everything.
From the beginning.

Petro: What's the size?

Catheinra: Two hundred thousand to two million
or more.

Petro: Can I read the message?

Catherina: Yes, here it is.

Francesca: It comes from a Mr. Mohammed Chahine.
He's arriving this evening.

Catherina: Oh yes?

Francesca: He's the planning minister.

Catherina: Yes, yes.

Francesca: Do you know him?

Catherina: Yes. We worked together on a project
in Alexandria. I met him while we were working
there.

Francesca: And you think that you will get the
contract?

Catherina: Let's say that ... I think that we could
get it, yes.

Petro: That would be really great! ... Tomorrow
morning. Catherina, do you want to see him alone,
or do you want all of us to see him.

Catherina: All of us.

Petro: In that case I'm gonna polish my shoes.

Catherina: Ah, yes, please. We must make the best
impression possible.

Petro: And I will also wear a clean shirt.

Catherina: All in all, we can't do much in twenty-four
hours.

Petro: Don't worry. Our prices are the best, we
are more competent, we can provide the best service
after the construction of the project, and we work
faster than our competition. I'm confident that
we'll win this contract.

(The phone rings.)

Francesca: Marex Mundial, Geneva. Good morning.
Yes, Mr. Tanner, she's in the office. It's for
you, Catherina, Mr. Tanner.

Catherina: Hello, Alan? No, I can't. No, I'm
sorry, it is really impossible. You know very well
why. Listen, Alan, things are like that. Accept
them the way they are, and let's not talk any further
about them. No, really, I don't want to.

Francesca: Do you think it would be better for
us to leave?

Petro: No, I want to listen. I find that interesting.

Catherina: Frankly, Alan, it would be better for
you not to call me up to talk about these things.
We will always be friends, colleagues, but that's
all. No, I really don't have anything else to say.
See you later, Alan. (Catherina directs her attention
to Francesca.) What were we talking about?

Francesca: I'm hoping to contact the minister's
hotel.

Catherina: Yes, fine. And afterwards we will have
to notify Martijn Ockrente and Olivero Rossi that
we will be having a meeting tomorrow.

Francesca: Yes. I'm gonna show them the telex.

Petro: Catherina, ... I couldn't help hearing your
conversation. I'm very sorry that things did not
go well between you and Alan.

Catherina: Oh well, it really couldn't have lasted
very long.

Petro: But any case, the news of a breakup is always
a bad piece of news.

Catherina: No, not really.

Petro: But even so, such breakups are always
difficult.

Catherina: Maybe so. ... Petro?

Petro: Yes?

Catherina: The other day you asked me out to dinner.

Petro: Yes?

Catherina Well, ...

Petro: Well, what?

Catherina: Well, do you have anything to do this
evening?

Petro: This evening?

Guide: Aha! It looks as though Petro and Catherina
are now going to become friends. It seems that
things are going better for them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Conventions for organization=
Conventions for organization:
* Moves are organized in a directory-like structure.
* Moves from a given position are referenced as relative links from the current position.  Thus, from the opening position at [[Chess_Opening_Theory]], the position reached after 1. e4 is addressed as [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1. e4|/1. e4]].  The position reached after 1. e4 e5 is addressed from the page at [[Chess_Opening_Theory]] as [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1. e4/1...e5|/1. e4/1...e5]].
* White moves are referenced as move number, period, space, move (in short algebraic). The space prevents an unbroken string of characters in the page title becoming too wide for the page.
* Black moves are referenced as move number, 3 periods, move (in short algebraic).  No spaces are used.
* Indications of check (+) or checkmate (#) are not included in the reference link because of Wikibooks restrictions on page titles, but should be indicated in the displayed text.
* Theory tables are optional, but very useful.  The best way to include these is by copying the table from another position.
* Board diagrams should be included on each page -- again, best copied from the previous position.
* If a Wikipedia entry exists for the position, reference the Wikipedia article and vice-versa.
* Do not copy analysis from copyrighted works.  The moves themselves are not subject to copyright, but the analysis is.
* If you find a transposition (common) use a redirect to an existing position.  An example of this is the [[Chess_Opening_Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. e4|tranposition of the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit to the French Defence]].

===Notation===
* Castling is O-O as in PGN. Letter O not number zero.
* There are no ! and ?s in the page names, nor indications of check/checkmate, nor e.p. though these may be included in the main text and hyperlinks.
* Position evaluations are optional. Stick with the Informator symbols: +- +/- +/= = =/+ -/+ -+ in that order. Also ∞.

==1st and 3rd person imperatives?==
So, a few years a go, I ran across a book whose name has since vanished, that had a full scope of Neapolitan imperative conjugations for the verb '''avé'''. 
I duly noted this and went on, figuring I would work it out later.  How can you have an imperative that is 1st or 3rd person? I have seen other Neapolitan imperatives for the plural 1st person, is this a quirk of the language and, if so, how does it work/what does it mean?
This is the info I got back when:

==Introduction==

Home canning, also known and bottling, is simple and has been used for preserving foods for many years. With the right equipment and recipes, anyone can begin preserving foods at home.

Care should be taken to follow the recipes and procedures. Botulism is a life threatening bacteria that is commonly associated with improper canning procedures.

==Equipment==
No matter how you choose to process your food, some things are common elements; tongs that you can use to lift full jars, glass jars, lids, sealing rings.  Cooking thermometers, a supply of clean cotton utility towels, and protective clothing such as silicone or leather gloves. Gloves can make handling hot products much easier; a bad grip on a liter jar full of boiling, sticky jam can be dangerous.

===Hot Water Bath===
A large, enamelled canning boiler with lid rack for jars should set you back no more than $US 40 if you look around.  Any large pot should do;  just place a metal rack like a cooling rack in the bottom of the pot to provide space under your jars for water to flow.

===Pressure Canning===
This is the pricier of the options, with a good pressure canner starting at around $US 75-140. Pressurize canning is required for all low acid foods.

====Types of Pressure Canners====

A pressure canner is not the same as a cooker. Some canners may be used for pressure cooking but a normal pressure cooker should not be used for canning.

==Warnings==

There are many methods of canning that people have used over time which are proven to be unsafe and even deadly.

Never can foods in the oven, a pot without a lid, microwave, steam canner, dishwasher, or by simply allowing hot jars to seal themselves.

A good seal alone is not enough to protect the contents from developing botulism.

While the oven may reach a suitable temperature, the contents of the jar will not reach a high enough temperature to destroy bacteria.

Stick to the recipes, add vinegar or lemon juice if it says to, and don't add sugar or anything that the recipe does not explicitly say you may.

[[w:Botulism|Information on Botulism]]

==General Process==

There are two approved methods of canning which are fairly similar and use much of the same equipment. The difference between the two is the type of pot you use and how it works.

Before you start, you need to know the altitude in which you live and adjust the approved recipe to ensure you are canning for the right length of time and pressure.

Preparing for either method is the same. Jars, lids and rings should be washed and kept warm until ready to fill with items to be processed. Some people keep their jars in a dishwasher with heat drying to hold them while others keep their jars in a pot of water on low heat. Never place hot foods into a cold jar or place a cold jar into a hot pot, thermal shock can cause the jars to break or even explode.

Lids and rings can be placed into a pan of warm water to simmer on low. Do not boil the lids, just keep them warm to prepare the sealing compound to be accepted by the jar.

===Hot Water Bath===

Set up the canner and heat water. Canner should be filled about 1/3 full and kept warm, not boiling until you are finished filling it with prepared jars. Set a pot of water on another burner in case you need to add more water after your jars are in place.

Prepare the items that you want to preserve according to an approved recipe. Follow the recipe carefully, changes to ingredients may reduce the amount of acid which could make your recipe unsafe.

Fill jars leaving the appropriate amount of head space for your recipe. Clean rims well, bits of food can prevent lids from sealing. Fit jar with a lid and adjust ring with a fingertip until it stops gently.

Place jars into canner making sure jars are covered by 2 inches of water, if more water is needed add from the extra pot you have heated on another burner. 

Place a lid on your pot and process according to the recipe you have chosen. Time begins when the water reaches a full boil.

Open the canner, being careful to prevent steam burns. Remove the jars to a place where they will be undisturbed for at least 8 - 12 hours. Do not adjust rings or tamper with lids. 

When jars are cooled, test seals by pressing in center and ensuring that lids don't raise. Remove rings, wash jars, label and put away in a dark cool place until you are ready to enjoy them.

===Pressure Canning===

If your canner has a dial gauge, the first thing you must do is check it for accuracy. Your local cooperative extension office should be able to do this for you free of charge.

Set up your pressure canner according the instructions included with it. Some canners require more water than others. You do not want the canner to run out of water at any time during the process. If processing is interrupted you will need to start from the beginning.

Prepare your recipe and fill your jars leaving the appropriate head space. Place jars into the canner as you work.

Check lid to make sure vent pipe is clear. Place the lid on the pot, making sure the handles are locked if necessary. Some canners have clamps that screw down while others simply lock by turning the lid.

Next the canner needs to be vented. This is done by adjusting the burner to a fairly high heat and waiting for a strong stream of steam to escape from the vent pipe. This needs to be done for a full 10 minutes. This removes air from the canner so pressure can build with the following step.

Place the regulator or weight onto the valve and wait for the canner to reach the necessary pressure. Use the dial gauge to determine this unless your canner does not have a gauge, then follow the manufacturers instructions. Some regulators need to jiggle several times per minute while others need to rock continuously.

Set your timer when you have reached the correct pressure. Change in pressure at any time can compromise the process, this could result in dangerous, under processed foods.

At the end of timing, turn burner off and wait for canner to depressurize on its own. Do not open or tamper with anything. Removing the regulator too soon or moving the canner can cause liquid from you jars to siphon or even cause the jars to break.

Remove the regulator or weight and wait an additional 10 minutes for the canner to cool.

Open the canner, being careful to prevent steam burns. Remove the jars to a place where they will be undisturbed for at least 8 - 12 hours. Do not adjust rings or tamper with lids. Cooling of jars from a pressure canner can take much longer than those that have been processed in a hot water bath.

When jars are cooled, test seals by pressing in center and ensuring that lids don't raise. Remove rings, wash jars, label and put away in a dark cool place until you are ready to enjoy them.

==Recipes==

There are many books and websites available with recipes for canning. Be sure to select a recipe that has been approved by the USDA. Recipes that are not tested should be considered dangerous.

The National Center for Home Food Preservation is an excellent source for approved recipes. 

===Pickling===

Pickling is a great option for foods that don't hold up well to the heat and time required by pressure canning. Items like broccoli and cauliflower need to be pressure canned but tend to fall apart and are unappealing. Pickling these items will leave you with a firm, crisp product that is safe because the acid level is high.

Basic picking recipes are a simple syrup made of vinegar, sugar and water.

===Jams and Jellies===

Jams, Jellies, Preserves and Butters are a popular way of preserving fruits and some vegetables. Processing times are usually quick and preparation can be quite simple. Sugar is often high but it is an excellent way to add fruit to your diet.

Jams include pectin or a modified starch to allow them to thicken or set to a desired consistency. Preserves and butters are often slow cooked to a thickness much like applesauce and don't use an additional thickener.

===Meats===

Meats need to be pressure canned every time, there is no approved method of canning meat in a boiling water bath.

Recipes for meats vary greatly. Some people prefer to can just the meat while others like to prepare them as heat and serve meals.

===Vegetables===

Many vegetables are low acid and need to be pressure canned. The same as with meats, many people like to combine different vegetables as a ready to serve side dish or to be added to soups and stews.

===Other Foods===

There are no safe recipes for certain food items. The USDA has not approved of any recipes for items including:
Milk, Cheese, Cream, Eggs, Flour, Starch, Thickening Agents, Grain, Pasta, Rice, Dried Beans, Zucchini, Summer Squash

Items baked in jars should never be stored outside of a freezer or refrigerator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is religion? A religion is a set of beliefs that has proved useful for the very survival of primitive societies, and enforced practices relating to the way an individual relates to society. Law is a codification of these practices which occurred soon after the advent of writing. One of the survival aids that religion brings is a belief that there is something or someone 'out there' monitoring our deeds and misdeeds, and at some point we will be rewarded in some future life. This gives reassurance both to bereaved families and to the brave young men needed to fight wars and die for their cause. It also excuses the excesses of leaders and justifies manifestly unfair use of force, including warmongering, the use of repression, torture and selective killing.

On 12th December 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations. This secular, perhaps humanist document synthesises the best principles of many religions and cultures, and provides a sort 'religious doctrine' of equality,liberty and freedom of expression to which most people might aspire. 

Generally religious establishments consider that they have divine and absolute revelation about everything, and are therefore very conservative. Somewhere between these two extreme views, there may be a better religion, that preserves the rich traditions and joyous ceremonies of antiquity - but which also places on everyone those modern rights and responsibilities which are essential for a just, peaceful and exciting future, free of war, famine, disease and injustice. Impossible? Perhaps, but a noble and worthwhile quest that Wikibookians might usefully share anyway.

What better way to commence our search for a universal religion than to examine what is currently known about the universe and its living contents? Using knowledge carefully compiled over many centuries and replacing assumptions with facts—this is, after all, why the majority of us no longer live in caves.

Communal decision-making (moral or practical) is facilitated by valuing the attainment of a communally valued purpose, one which is readily recognized as applicable to all—a universal purpose. Unfortunately, as the next two chapters relate, to the best of our current understanding nothing about either the universe or life necessitates that they be purpose-driven.

Scientists can’t prove that a purpose was necessary for the universe or life to form; neither can they prove that a purpose was not necessary. All they can state is that both the universe and life are present, both change over time, and nothing more than that described by a few laws, principles and theories of physics is needed to explain their existence and ensure their evolution. As [[../Looking For A Purpose/Can We Adopt The Universe's Purpose?|Can We Adopt The Universe's Purpose?]] notes, our current physics is not powerful enough to determine whether or not a purpose existed before our universe began—the only place a predetermining purpose might be found.

However, there is a possible way around the dilemma created by our failure to find a universe-governing purpose. This is discussed in [[../Life And Exploiting/Complexity, Intelligence And Evolution|Complexity, Intelligence And Evolution]] which suggests that a possible consequence of life’s behaviour could be used as a “surrogate” purpose. It turns out that this “consequence” has a number of valuable contributions to offer (it can readily be used to guide moral decision making, for instance—an exercise explored in [[../Determining Moral Behaviours/Determining Moral Behaviour|Determining Moral Behaviour]]). ''Purpose'' concludes by constructing a reason to think that the “possible consequence” might even be a “probable consequence” (which would greatly increase its value, should it be adopted to be the “purpose” that heads a universal religion).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pascal Text ==

Your Pascal Text on Pascal [[Computer programming]] is off topic. You should tell the reader about the advantages/disadvantages of Pascal as a teaching language.

You don't have to redo it all - i.E. you can tell the reader that the Algol based syntax is easier to learn - However the history of Pascal should go to wikipedia.

Please note: I will - after a grace period - remove any off topic article - or parts of it - as I have done before.

--[[User:Janne Timmerbacka|Janne Timmerbacka]] 21:27, 29 August 2005 (UTC)Thanks. I agree. I just hoped Pascal to be mentioned. I'll remove the text.

: Don't get me wrong: Pascal is a good teaching language and should be mentioned. You just have to keep the text on topic: &quot;Why learn Pascal?&quot; - &quot;Which paradigms will Pascal teach me?&quot;.</text>

=French Defence: Tarrasch Variation=
The move Nd2 prevents Black from entering the Winawer (3.Nc3 Bb4). The knight on d2 exerts no pressure on d5 and may lead to slower development of white's pieces but the move is solid and leads to games of a more positional nature than its main alternative of 3.Nc3.

=French Defence - Advance Variation=
White gains some space advantage immediately, and prevents Black from developing their king's knight to its most natural square f6.

Because Black's position is somewhat cramped at the moment, he usually decides to undermine White's pawn chain on d4/e5, which
hinders Black from developing the pieces of their kingside to good squares.  This is typically done by attacking the base of White's pawn chain - d4 - by playing [[/3...c5|3...c5]].

=Exchange Variation=
This is the Exchange Variation of the French Defence. Up until the mid-19th century this was regarded as the main line of the French Defence. The Exchange Variation is a dull, drawish, and static opening, prompting Wilhelm Steinitz to write, &quot;I have never in my life played the French Defense, which is among the dullest of openings.&quot; It was only around the 1860s and 1870s that the variations arising after 3.Nc3, 3.Nd2, and 3.e5 became popular.

The Exchange Variation leads to a symmetrical pawn structure. Both sides often develop symmetrically, while giving no room for imbalance in the game, which is why the opening is so drawish. Players who want a draw only will often employ the Exchange Variation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Unique naming convention ==

Hi, I assembled the {{bad link|Top active}} list of Wikibooks. Unfortunately, Computer programming pages intermingle with programming languages, and it is not easy to attribute the pages to a book, without double counting (for example, the listing contains the books of Programming:C, Programming:Ada, etc, so I can not easily separate out pages that are connected to the ''theory'' of programming). If somebody is still working on this book, please consider a consistent and unique naming convention.

Please leave &quot;Programming:&quot; only to the programming languages, and put all chapters belonging to &quot;Computer programming&quot; either to &quot;Computer programming:...&quot; or, since subpages have been activated on Wikibooks recently, use 

 Computer programming
 Computer programming/Statements
 Computer programming/Control statements
 Computer programming/Structured programming
 ...

(subpages give additional navigational advantages, e.g. an automatic link to the parent page, etc.)

Logged in users can easily move pages by the &quot;move&quot; command. Thanks! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 06:23, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Yes, I was thinking about that as well - And indeed, subpages seem to be the way to go. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 08:36, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Excuse me. Firstly, we need to agree on a Wikibooks wide convention '''FIRST'''. Second, you can't just act on one proposal. Solicit others point of view '''FIRST'''. That is what Andreas was doing. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:11, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: At least there are two users who thought about converting &quot;Computer programming&quot; more into a book again (it still looks a bit like a bookshelf, with all the Computer science TOC copied here as well - to my opinion unnecessarily since they belong to a different book). I'd suggest to put the &quot;real&quot; table of contents to the top, with the table linking to other programming languages a little bit lower, and if desired a wiki link to other books of interest, but no need for the inclusion of other book's table of contents.
::: The other question of more general interest is a Wikibooks wide convention on page organization. We should probably open a discussion page specifically on that - or is there already some around that I am not aware of? The activation of subpages has been praised some time ago, but only some books adapt this practise. The majority of books still have the &quot;Bookname:...&quot; convention, and some older ones have &quot;...(Biology)&quot; (which I think can be ruled out for a future recommendation). So the question is &quot;:&quot; or &quot;/&quot;. Where should we open a prominent discussion page? I don't deny that I am in favor of a gradual change to the &quot;/&quot; subpage style... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 13:07, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::: I support the use of subpages project-wide. For discussing it I think we could use [[Wikibooks talk:Naming conventions]] or [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 13:52, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::: I'm sorry, I'm just getting a little sick of people just pulling away and doing their own thing without really discussing it. We need to be much more consistent across books. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:09, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Functional programming ==

Just a minor thought occurred to me... the same technique we use (templates) to share text between programming books can be applied to specific paradigms of programming.  For example, functional languages like [[Haskell|Programming:Haskell]], {bad link|Programming:Caml}} and [[Scheme Programming|Programming:Scheme]] have a lot of things in common.  Perhaps we could make a set of [[Computer Programming/Functional programming]] templates as well -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:35, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: shure - that was the idea - write fundamentals once - use them for many languages. And the template technique does not work in one directions only - [[Computer Programming/Control]] was first written for Ada only and then generalised. BTW: What is your opinion on the [[Wikibooks:Hierachy_naming_scheme]] discussion? --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 12:51, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Perl &amp; PHP ==

Well [[User:81.180.101.1]] added Perl &amp; PHP today - but not a single &quot;yes&quot; link. Should we give him/her a week (to the 28.04.2005) to provide some articles and then remove the columns again?

= Blackmar-Diemer Gambit 2. e4 =
===2. e4===
White offers his e4 pawn in exchange for quick development and open lines. At the professional level this move is considered somewhat suspect, but black must be careful if he chooses to take the pawn as there are many traps in this opening. 
[[/2...dxe4|2 ...dxe4]], accepting the pawn, is the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit.
Black has three ways to decline the gambit.
*[[../../../1. e4/1...e6/2. d4/2...d5|e6]] transposes to the French Defence
*[[../../../1. e4/1...c6/2. d4/2...d5|c6]] transposes to the Caro-Kann Defence
*[[../../../1. e4/1...Nc6/2. d4/2...d5|Nc6]] the Nimzowitsch Defence
*[[/2...c5|c5]] is a largely unexplored countergambit.

==Procedure==
# Cook and peel potatoes and allow to cool, then mash.
# In a bowl combine the chicken, mayonnaise, onion, salt and pepper.
# Line a deep dish with plastic wrap, or place a molding cylinder on a plate.
# Add the mashed potatoes to form a bed about 1 cm tall at the bottom.
# Add a second layer of 1 cm of the chicken mixture evenly over the potato.
# Top the chicken mixture with a final layer of potato, forming a sandwich of chicken inside two layers of potato.
# Demold or remove the cylinder.
# [[cookbook:Garnish|Garnish]] with lettuce and mayonnaise.
# Cut the hard boiled eggs in discs and place on top. Add black olives, if desired.
# This dish can be served slightly cold.

Variations:

Mashed potatoes can be prepared with a mix of olive oil and butter and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice. You can compensate lemon with salt. (Don't add milk)

You can as well replace chicken with a can of tuna mixed with mayonnaise and fine chopped onion. Serve this variation fresh only.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Ariel (moon).jpg|220px|right|Ariel as seen by Voyager 2]]
Ariel is a moon of Uranus. The first and only observations of Ariel were made by Voyager 2 during its January 1986 flyby of Uranus. Only the Southern hemisphere was photographed, since the moon's south pole was pointed towards the Sun.

==How big is Ariel?==
Ariel is about 1157.8 km wide.

==What is its surface like?==
The surface of Ariel does not have many craters. It has a huge network of fault canyons and liquid water outflows over its surface.

==How long is a day on Ariel?==
One day on Ariel is equal to 2.52 days on Earth.

==How long is its orbit around Uranus?==
One Orbit around Uranus is also equal to 2.52 days.

==What is it made of?==
Ariel is made of roughly 50% water ice, 30% silicate rock, and 20% methane ice, and it appears to have regions of fresh frost in places.

==How much would Ariel's gravity pull on me?==

'''Newtons''' describe how hard gravity is pulling you down.  On Earth, if you weigh 51 kilograms or 112 pounds, your weight is 500 newtons. We only use newtons for some special purposes, when we are really interested in how hard we push down on something because gravity is pulling us. 

Your weight in newtons would be less on Ariel, only about 0.27 times what it is on Earth.  To find your weight in newtons as you stand on Ariel, just take your weight on Earth, and if that weight is in kilograms, multiply it by 2.65.  If that weight is in pounds, multiply it by 1.2 to get newtons.  But then you'll have to add in the weight of your spacesuit as well, because that is pressing down on the surface just like you are.

==Who is it named after?==
Ariel is named after a sylph, a creature made of air, in Alexander Pope's poem ''Rape of the Lock''.

==How was it discovered?==
Ariel was discovered on October 24, 1851 by William Lassell. He also discovered Umbriel at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of our discoveries about the universe have come through collecting and studying electromagnetic radiations. For many centuries, visible light waves were the only kind of radiation we could detect, and we could not do much with them until Galileo constructed his telescopes. But the electromagnetic spectrum holds much more information than that contained in the light waves visible to our eyes. The full spectrum ranges from very long radio waves, microwaves and the infrared, through the rainbow’s hues, to ultraviolet, X-rays, and highly energetic gamma rays. Our ability to understand what is happening throughout the universe depends upon our ability to invent, build and utilize instruments able to gather in these waves, remove spurious background noise, then to amplify, analyze and make sense of the minute differences so revealed. The past few decades have opened many electromagnetic inspection windows, and the next will undoubtedly open many more. Thus, what follows in this chapter will certainly need to be updated as we learn more, but the chapter’s major premises will likely remain valid, for they are supported by many millions of solidly based observations.

Let us begin this explanation of what has been discovered about the universe by describing just a little of what everyone can readily see. We will then use the laws of physics and the “causality principle” to extrapolate backwards in time; this reveals how things must have been in the past to cause them to be as we see them today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two competing theories quickly emerged to explain the expanding universe phenomenon: the Steady State theory and the Big Bang theory. The first postulated that the universe is self-sustaining, and claimed that what we see today is what will be seen in billions of years time; galaxies move apart, but the total picture remains the same. According to the Steady State theory, the stars that are moving outwards are being replaced by new ones that are perpetually being formed out of cosmic dust. This dust is being created from atoms, the theory went, that themselves are being continuously created from cosmic energy. (We cannot observe this creation, because the theory predicts that it need only occur at a rate of about one atom per 500 cubic meters, every 1000 years,&lt;ref&gt;See Fred Hoyle, ''The Nature of the Universe'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; which is far too slow to be detected.)

In contrast, the Big Bang explanation stated that the universe began with an explosion, and that everything within has been moving apart since that moment, with the intervening space expanding and cooling&lt;ref&gt;Gases cool when they expand and heat up when compressed (as is readily noted when using a hand pump to inflate a bicycle tire). Refrigerators exploit this property, using a pump to compress a gas outside the refrigerator (usually in tubes on the back, where excess heat dissipates into the environment) and allowing the gas to expand, and therefore cool, inside (usually in tubes surrounding the freezer box).&lt;/ref&gt; as it proceeds. In this theory, everything was created during, or shortly after, “the bang,” rather than slowly and continuously, atom by atom.&lt;ref&gt;Since light from the most distant galaxies we can observe takes over thirteen billion years to reach us, the Big Bang must have occurred before then.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the discussions reported in the press when these theories were announced, shortly after the second world war provided a stimulating intellectual alternative to the dreary task of becoming formally educated. At that time, I favoured the Steady State theory because I couldn’t understand how everything could come from nothing in one big burst. Creation seemed slightly more feasible if it happened very slowly, and I thought that perhaps the atoms being created came from energy released as the matter in receding galaxies became stretched further and further apart.&lt;ref&gt;Matter and energy are different aspects of the same thing (as E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; informs us), and one can be turned into the other. (The symbols E, m, and c, stand for energy, mass, and the speed of light, respectively. Since c is so very large, and is multiplied by itself in this equation, a tiny piece of matter is equivalent to a very large amount of energy. Thus, it takes a very large amount of energy to produce a speck of matter.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Steady State theory also seemed more appealing philosophically, because if the universe continued forever, one would never have a beginning to explain.

However, three observations eventually dismissed the Steady State theory. First, if the universe did start with a bang, then there should still be some trace evidence of this explosion to be found. And there is; it has been heard since radio astronomy first began. Everywhere one searches, in addition to the electromagnetic information received from stars and galaxies, there is a constant hiss of background radiation. This hiss comes from energy that remains (unconverted into matter) from the originating Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;This radiation has since been accurately measured (by instruments on the COBE, or Cosmic Background Explorer, spacecraft) to be energy at three degrees above absolute zero. Calculations of the temperature changes which residual radiation would undergo over time following the Big Bang predict precisely this temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another COBE experiment mapped the universe’s very early energy distribution, and found small ripples that could have been the variations that led to the formation of galaxies and galactic clusters. (If the originating Big Bang radiation was perfectly uniformly distributed, the specks of matter that formed from it [via E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or rather, m = E/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] would also have been perfectly uniformly distributed, and gravitational pulls on each speck would have balanced on every side. In such a case, there would have been no gravitationally caused condensation, and therefore no stars, galaxies, planets, life, or us.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recent measurements of the polarization of cosmic background radiation provides additional evidence of the veracity of the Big Bang theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the universe does not remain the same over time, as the Steady State theory requires; it changes as it becomes older. This was discovered when quasar locations were established upon a four-dimensional map of the universe. This showed them to exist only at great distances from our system, signifying that they were present billions of years ago but no longer exist today.&lt;ref&gt;Quasars are enormously bright objects located toward the edge of our universe, and look similar to stars (hence their name—“quasi-stella”). Quasars existed only within the first few billion years or so of our universe’s formation. They depended upon the presence of supermassive black holes (gigantic agglomerations of matter about one hundred million times more massive than our sun). Each quasar emitted massive amounts of energy (the light we are seeing now, billions of years later—typically about three times more radiation than is currently emitted by the sum total of all of the stars in our galaxy). Electromagnetic radiations from quasars were produced by electrically charged matter (i.e., gases, stars, star clusters and even galaxies) spinning around the black hole before being swallowed. (Once inside a black hole’s boundary—the “event horizon”—nothing can escape, not even light; hence the name, black hole.)&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers also find (by searching far and near in distance, and so effectively far and near in time) that galaxies tend to change their shape as they age.

Third, scientists have calculated the variety and abundance of chemical elements that should have been formed following the Big Bang, and their calculations predict exactly the ratios that are found to exist in space. Furthermore, the particular mixture predicted by the Big Bang theory (and corroborated by observation) is quite different from the mixture that the Steady State theory predicts.

Various other kinds of evidence support the Big Bang theory, and it rules the roost today.&lt;ref&gt;One intriguing argument against the idea that the universe could have existed forever, as required by the Steady State theory, is that we have not been overrun by visiting aliens, either directly or by way of von Neumann probes. (These are devices that technologically competent life forms will be able to construct that explore planetary systems and use what they find to replicate themselves many-fold, before moving on again.) Of course, this argument fails if we are the only intelligent beings in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For more about self-replicating machines, see John von Neumann (A. W. Burks, ed.), ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; The creating Bang is calculated to have occurred about 13.7 billion years ago.

While no cosmologist doubts that our universe is expanding, there has been much debate about whether it will continue to expand forever. Should this be the case, our universe will end up as a diffuse, dark, frigid, dead junkyard, with no energy differences left to power change. If, however, the attractive gravitational forces are strong enough, the universe’s current expansion will be slowed down, stopped, then reversed. This reversal would cause everything to be pulled tighter and tighter together, and it would all eventually be gathered into one gigantic black hole, presumably to continue shrinking until it reverted back to whence it came.

This uncertainty about the universe’s future may have been resolved by measurements taken over the last five or so years. Measurements of the brightness and red shift of distant supernovae (see next section) yield the recession speed of the universe when it was young. Comparisons of that speed with the recession speed shown by nearby galaxies reveals that the universe’s rate of expansion is increasing, not slowing down.&lt;ref&gt;See Donald Goldsmith, ''The Runaway Universe: The Race to Find the Future of the Cosmos'' (Perseus Publishing, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; (It is currently thought that the slightly repulsive gravitational force of the “vacuum energy”&lt;ref&gt;Also known as “dark energy”—named (as is dark matter) because it cannot be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Space is not a void as most assume; it is filled with a form of energy called dark or vacuum energy. This energy exerts a very weak negative gravitational force that builds in magnitude as the intervening space increases. Its weak nature explains why its repulsive force needs trans-universe distances to have any affect. Vacuum energy may owe its existence to a dynamical quantum field (similar to an electro-magnetic field) called “quintessence,” or it may be an inert property of empty space (accounted for by the cosmological constant), a possibility first proposed by Einstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dark energy accounts for about 65% of the universe’s mass. Normal matter, of which we and everything we see are made, amounts to only 4%. Dark matter (see earlier) accounts for the rest.&lt;/ref&gt; of empty space may be causing this acceleration.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Big Bang theory postulates that the universe came into being when what amounts to an infinitely large amount of energy suddenly appeared as an infinitesimally small speck (fittingly called a singularity). Where this energy came from—no one knows.&lt;ref&gt;Inflation theory suggests that the energy contained within the universe’s gravitational field exactly equals in amount, but opposes in type, the energy contained within all other constituents of the universe (photons and particles, etc.). Thus, since they balance out, the universe could have been created from nothing. This poses questions such as: “what existed to cause nothing to become something?” and, “are nothing and something one and the same thing, and if so, just what does that mean?”&lt;/ref&gt; How so much energy could occupy next to zero volume—no one knows. One theory postulates the existence of another universe, vastly bigger than the one we inhabit and hidden in additional space/time dimensions, and suggests that it could have created and fed the singularity. This background universe could be periodically “blowing bubbles” that inflate into universes.&lt;ref&gt;Theoretically, many inflation-causing bubbles could occur, each growing to contain a universe. Each universe would be discrete and unique, and each could perhaps be controlled by physical laws different from those that control events in our universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Current thoughts about the beginning of our universe (and the possibility that it could be only one of many) are presented by Martin Rees in “Exploring Our Universe and Others,” in the December 1999 issue of ''Scientific American'', 78-83. (This article also provides a pictorial summary of the evolution of our universe from its beginning to its possible ending.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See also ''Theories of Everything: The Quest for Ultimate Explanation'' by John D. Barrow (New York: Oxford University Press. 1990). This thought-provoking book explores the significance of the initial conditions, laws, constants, and other critical factors, in the development of our understanding of what makes the universe behave the way we observe it behaving. Barrow makes a somewhat difficult subject enjoyable to readers as he describes the thinking of philosophers, mathematicians and scientists, from the early days of science to the quantum theories of the present.&lt;/ref&gt; Our (relatively small, on this scale) universe could have originated within one of these bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;Our “gigantic” universe is mostly space. It has been calculated that, if all the space separating galaxies, stars, electrons from nuclei in atoms, etc., were removed, then the whole of the universe’s matter would occupy a volume less than that enclosed by a sphere whose radius equalled the distance between our sun and Mars.&lt;/ref&gt; Superstring Theory (see [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]]) supports the existence of many universes (of which ours is one), each being formed from, and eventually returned to, empty space.

Regardless of what actually occurred to “begin our universe,” and what was needed before this event to cause it to happen, scientists can account for what is seen today simply by postulating that everything came from a single point in one Big Bang then applying some known laws of physics.

Rather than making guesses about what might have happened beyond and before our universe began (guesses that can never be substantiated—see [[../What Started It All?/]] of this chapter), let us start with what is generally accepted—a Big Bang/Inflationary origin to our universe. This theory is able to explain much that we observe, and it yields accurate predictions, hallmark properties of a good scientific theory. Assuming that the laws of physics as we know them today also applied almost immediately following the Bang,&lt;ref&gt;This assumption may be incorrect. Recent measurements of the absorption spectra shown by light that passed less than a billion years after the Big Bang through gas clouds containing metallic atoms, suggest that the electronic charge at that time differed slightly from today’s value. This does not mean that the laws of physics have changed, but it does warn us to be careful about the assumptions we make: values thought to be constant, may not actually be so.&lt;/ref&gt; we can reconstruct the history of the universe. This has been carried out by various people over the past fifty years, with modifications and revisions being made each time someone was able to improve the fit between astronomical observations and theory. Today, scientists think that something very like the following occurred.

Immediately upon the original insertion of energy, time in this continuum began, and space was created by separating energy components. This was followed by an extremely rapid expansion. Starting about 10{{e|-37}} of a second after the Bang,&lt;ref&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;-37&lt;/sup&gt; is shorthand for 1 divided by 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, a very tiny fraction of anything.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasting until about 10{{e|-34}} of a second,&lt;ref&gt;In other words about one thousandth of a second, a relatively short period of time for what transpired. This “inflationary” period immediately followed the energy insertion we call the Big Bang. (The whole episode might be compared to the rapid inflation of an automobile air-bag that follows the detonation of its initiating charge.)&lt;/ref&gt; this minute bubble of pure energy that was to become our universe inflated to 1050 times its previous size.&lt;ref&gt;This inflationary behaviour explains the homogeneity of the cosmos by showing that it could have resulted from the universe’s initial uniformity being preserved by the rapidity of its expansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An excellent description of inflation is given in Michael White and John Gribbin’s book, ''Stephen Hawking: A Life in Science'' (London: Penguin Books, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first one hundred seconds or so following the Bang, only energy (in various forms of radiation) could have existed.&lt;ref&gt;This is because, to produce the amount of matter we observe in our universe today, the initial radiation energy density—and thus its temperature—must have been so high that any matter forming would have been immediately broken apart by radiation bombardment.&lt;/ref&gt; Continued expansion and further cooling of this hot dense ball of energy continued until, after about 300,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;Neutrons, protons, and other particles of matter, would have formed from little packets of energy much earlier, but they would have been immediately broken apart by collisions with highly energetic radiation quanta.&lt;/ref&gt; the temperature was low enough (about 3,000°C) for atoms of hydrogen (and helium, the next lightest element) to remain intact. From this time onward the universe would contain matter.&lt;ref&gt;Smoot and Davidson summarize existing theories about events during various time periods, particularly the initial seconds following the Big Bang, in two colourful plates (between pages 182-183) of their book. See George Smoot and Keay Davidson, ''Wrinkles in Time: The Imprint of Creation'' (Little, Brown and Company (U.K.) Ltd., 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

These atoms of hydrogen and helium&lt;ref&gt;The extremely high early temperatures forced hydrogen nuclei to fuse together and form helium. This early fusion stopped after expansion sufficiently lowered the temperature, and the universe was left with the 23-24% helium content we now find throughout space. (Although fusion continues in the centre of stars, next to none of the helium produced by this means escapes into space.)&lt;/ref&gt; continued to move apart, and the temperature of the universe continued to drop. Gravitational forces pulled wisps of atoms closer together, forming tremendous, irregularly shaped clouds, and these eventually further condensed to form many giant gas balls. Condensation continued, with the gases at the centre of each ball forming first black holes, then supermassive black holes.&lt;ref&gt;There are many millions of black holes in our galaxy alone. They range in size from small, just a few times larger than our sun, to supermassive. Supermassive black holes can contain millions or billions of times more matter than our sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Chandra X-ray satellite telescope has determined (by analyzing radiations from objects twelve billion light-years distant from the Earth) that twelve billion years ago the universe teemed with billions of active supermassive black holes sucking up gas, stars, and debris. This same telescope has recently confirmed that our galaxy, the Milky Way, rotates around a supermassive black hole (this one some two and a half million times more massive than our sun). A different detection method (red-shift spectrography) has found more than thirty supermassive black holes in our neighbourhood, including one in Andromeda. Many (if not all) galaxies rotate around supermassive black holes, most of which have engulfed much of the matter in their vicinity and thus become dormant.&lt;/ref&gt; Electrically charged gases (spiralling ever faster and faster around these holes before being swallowed) emitted intense electromagnetic radiation fields that pushed the surrounding gases away. Clouds of these gases then themselves condensed to form additional smaller balls. As gravity pulled the gases in each of these balls tighter together they began to heat up. Eventually the temperature within each became so high that thermonuclear reactions occurred, and the gas balls began to emit light. These high-temperature, hydrogen-gas balls, are called stars.&lt;ref&gt;See “The First Stars in the Universe,” by Richard B. Larson and Volker Bromm, ''Scientific American'', December 2001, 64-71, for an alternative, computer-generated, account of early star formation.&lt;/ref&gt; The large collections of stars that rotate around supermassive black holes are called galaxies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stars contain huge amounts of hydrogen, and the gravitational forces near their centre are extremely high. This creates a pressure which pushes the hydrogen nuclei closer and closer, eventually fusing pairs of them together, creating helium. Since one helium nucleus has slightly less mass than the two hydrogen nuclei that formed it, the surplus mass has to be released. This occurs, but the release is not in the form of a particle of matter; the mass difference is radiated away as energy,&lt;ref&gt;Published in 1905, Einstein’s E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equation explains the origin of the large amounts of energy our sun and the stars release, although the particular sequence of events occurring in a star’s core was not deduced until theoretical work was conducted leading to the atomic bomb in the 1940s.&lt;/ref&gt; and many such fusings quickly raise the sun’s core temperature (which stabilizes at about twenty million degrees Celsius). Physicists replicate this process in hydrogen bombs,&lt;ref&gt;The power of an atomic bomb comes from atomic fission (splitting apart), whereas the vastly greater power of a hydrogen bomb comes from atomic fusion (joining together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is relatively simple to make atomic bombs using radioactive isotopes of uranium, because they are constantly splitting apart (with each split releasing energy, other emissions, and neutrons, which then bang into and split other atoms—producing the so-called chain reaction). All that’s required is to drive together pieces of uranium (the more radioactive, “enriched” isotope U-235, is used). (The difficulty stems from finding a way to force the lumps together sufficiently quickly that many atoms split before the resultant energy release pushes everything too far apart [which stops the chain reaction]. This problem was solved by detonating a containing shell of conventional explosives.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is slightly more difficult to force enough hydrogen atoms together to make a hydrogen bomb. Physicists succeeded by exploding an atomic bomb and using the extremely high pressure this developed to compress surrounding tritium (an isotope of hydrogen that contains two, rather than one, neutrons in its nucleus). Squeezed tightly enough together, tritium atoms fuse to form slightly lighter atoms of helium; the small amount of extraneous matter is expelled in the form of large amounts of energy.&lt;/ref&gt; and they are attempting to do the same thing in the laboratory. (Here the biggest problem is how to contain and control the high temperatures involved&lt;ref&gt;The announcement that “cold fusion” was possible created much excitement in 1989. Many thought, for a while, that everyone could one day have a little fusion reactor in their home, turning deuterium into cheap energy. (Energy generated this way would be cheap because the deuterium used as fuel can be produced by processing water, which requires much less energy than that released when deuterium is fused to form helium.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the experimental results were difficult to reproduce, and no practical means of generating power from low energy nuclear reactions has been demonstrated.
(This cost-benefit does not apply to hydrogen fuel cells. The amount of electrical energy required to produce the fuel hydrogen exceeds that released when it is later combined with oxygen in fuel cells. Automobile companies are gearing up to use fuel cells in transportation because fuel cell emissions are pollution-free [and because of government legislation], not because hydrogen provides low-cost energy.)&lt;/ref&gt;—about 100 million degrees, or over five times the temperature of the sun’s core, in some research reactors.)

The average star today&lt;ref&gt;Hydrogen was more plentiful earlier in the universe’s life, and stars were generally bigger than they are today. Larger stars burn faster and have a shorter life.&lt;/ref&gt; burns for about ten billion years. As a star’s hydrogen continues to form helium, its core gradually shrinks. This causes it to become hotter, and its nuclear fusions become more complex. Through fusions, helium is converted into carbon and oxygen, then into other elements (those in approximately the first quarter of the periodic table). Further core shrinkage eventually creates enough radiation to induce a big expansion of the outer layers, and stars that are about the size of our sun become red giants, enveloping any orbiting planets in incandescent gases. Eventually, fusion can no longer be sustained in the core, and red giants shrink, lose their outer layers of gases, and become compact white dwarfs. This is likely to be the fate of our sun and its planets, some six billion years in the future.

A number of stars are large enough to avoid this kind of relatively slow death. Their extra mass creates higher core temperatures and heavier elements are formed. However, forming nuclei of elements beyond iron requires an input of energy (because extra energy is needed to hold together the many mutually repulsive protons such nuclei contain). This reduces the energy released during fusion to a point where it can no longer counterbalance gravitational attraction, and the star collapses. This sudden implosion releases tremendous amounts of energy and everything immediately heats up again. This, in turn, rapidly fuses many of the existing elements into the larger and more complex elements that exist beyond iron (over eighty of them; copper, silver, gold and mercury, for example). The core's raging furnace builds in intensity and soon explodes, scattering the star’s chemical elements into space. Some massive stars undergo several cycles of explosions and collapses. (Astronomers occasionally witness these events; each explosion is termed a nova.) Other giant stars explode completely in one detonation; what is then seen is called a supernova.&lt;ref&gt;It was earlier proposed that hypernova, about a hundred times larger than the average supernova, could occur and be the source of extremely intense gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of energy that have been detected, but GRBs are now thought to signal the birth of black holes.&lt;/ref&gt; Both appear abruptly as bright patches of light in the sky, often intense enough to be visible in daylight, occurring in the spot formerly occupied by a star.&lt;ref&gt;The remnants of a supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers as occurring July 4, 1054 CE, can still be seen in the Crab Nebula. When first observed, it remained bright enough to be visible during the day for more than three weeks. (Since the Crab Nebula is 6,300 light-years away, the supernova actually exploded 6,300 years before it was first observed on Earth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On February 24th, 1987, astronomers observed a star, known to have been about twenty times more massive than our sun, exploding as a supernova. The emissions from its remains are being carefully monitored to learn more about the processes involved.&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers find and study one or two new novae each year, and witness gigantic supernovae blossoming within our galaxy, the Milky Way, an average of twice a century. In the ten billion years of our galaxy’s existence,&lt;ref&gt;The visible universe is calculated to be approximately 13.7 billion years old.&lt;/ref&gt; about two hundred million supernovae have spewed out the chemical elements we know from spectroscopic evidence to be present throughout its volume. The dark patches (mentioned earlier in this chapter), observed within interstellar and intergalactic space, are due to the presence of vast clouds of these minute dust particles. This dust (altogether amounting to hundreds of times more matter than is contained within the total of every galaxy’s collection of stars and planets) is mostly composed of the elements formed and ejected during novae and supernovae explosions. These particles absorb and obscure light from the stars and galaxies that lie beyond, and it is the absence of this light that produces regions that appear to be dark.

The visible universe is estimated to contain some 100,000,000,000 (100 billion) galaxies, and an average galaxy (such as ours) accommodates a collection of some 2-300,000,000,000 (200-300 billion) stars. Thus, there are twenty to thirty thousand billion billion (i.e., 20-30,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, that is, 20-30 sextillion, or 2-3x10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) stars all told in our universe.&lt;ref&gt;There are so many stars in the universe that modern telescopes would be able to detect supernovae occurring every minute, if they were aimed in the right direction.&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, stars of all descriptions have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Most stars pair up to form binary (or larger) systems and orbit each other around a common centre of gravity. Single stars, like our sun, are the exception, rather than the rule. Binary systems would produce complex effects on orbiting planets, and this might affect the number of planets supporting life forms.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, only about a half-million years old,&lt;ref&gt;Part of Orion’s sword, the Great Orion Nebula (about 1500 light-years distant from us) contains a star-forming region. About 700 young stars lie within the centre of this nebula, and some 150 of these are surrounded by rings of gas and dust particles that herald the future formation of planetary systems (see [[../The Earth/]] of this chapter).&lt;/ref&gt; have been photographed via the infrared radiation they emit. These newly formed “baby” stars already show a spin (imparted by the kinetic energy of condensing gases as they are drawn into the star by gravitational attraction), which the star retains for its lifetime. Observations suggest that about half of all newly formed stars are also accompanied by a rotating disk of gases, particles, dust and debris. Matter that is not pulled into the star is gradually pushed away by the star’s radiation and most eventually disperse into space. However, gravity also pulls some of the disk’s matter and dust together to form aggregates; the largest of these we call planets.&lt;ref&gt;Asteroids are pieces of matter that have been left over from this process. Most of our sun’s asteroids move in an elliptical orbit (the asteroid belt) between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Significantly more of the early dust from which our planetary system originated still orbits the sun as chunks of dust and ice outside Pluto (the Oort Belt). These lumps can be displaced from their orbits by passing stars, and some have taken up elliptical orbits around the sun, occasionally becoming visible as comets.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brightness and remoteness of stars generally prevent us from directly observing any planets that might orbit them.&lt;ref&gt;However, some planets have been observed directly by telescopes (see http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-1998/pr-18-98.html).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the presence of planets can be inferred by various techniques, and some nearby stars are now known to have orbiting bodies. One way to determine if a star has one or more planetary companions is to measure its wobble&lt;ref&gt;Two planets (with a strong likelihood of there being a third occupying a life-favourable position) have been found to orbit the star 55 Cancri, by this method.&lt;/ref&gt; (caused because the orbiting bodies together rotate about their common centre of mass, i.e., the star no longer rotates about its own centre and therefore looks as if it is “wobbling.” A similar wobble can occur when a car tire is “unbalanced.”) Another way to find planets is to look for lensing effects, when light from distant stars becomes bent due to gravitational pull as it passes close to large masses, such as those of giant (e.g., Jupiter-size or greater) planets.&lt;ref&gt;Light-bending was predicted by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (published in 1916). When a solar eclipse occurred in 1919, a team of astronomers used the opportunity to check the theory’s accuracy. As the moon blocked the sun’s radiance, they were able to photograph light coming from stars located behind the sun. Since the sun itself lay on a straight line drawn between these stars and the Earth, this could only happen if the light from these stars bent, as predicted, as it travelled close to the sun.&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers also look for emission intensity variations and dark spots transiting the face of stars (caused by planets crossing in front of a star and so preventing some of its light from reaching the observing telescopes).&lt;ref&gt;Some of the light from the star HD 209458 is periodically blocked by a planet that orbits it.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of rings of matter surrounding some stars gives observers yet another way to infer that planets have been (or are being) formed about a star, and circular gaps within such rings of dust almost certainly mean that planets are present. (Clumps of particles within a ring gravitationally sweep up additional dust as they travel around a star; this causes the orbiting bodies to gradually enlarge and leaves the gaps that are seen. These dust aggregates may ultimately become large enough to form asteroids and planets.&lt;ref&gt;The thousands of gaps in Saturn’s rings are likely to have been created by satellites of various sizes. Saturn has about twenty confirmed moons, an additional dozen or so possible ones, plus millions of smaller chunks formed from frozen gas and water.&lt;/ref&gt; Most stars, including our own, lose much of their dust halo due to this process [as well as due to pressure from the star’s radiation] in the first 400 million years following their birth.) Planets may also be sought and even studied by examining the doppler-shifted starlight scattered by their atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;The planet that orbits Boötis has been investigated in this manner.&lt;/ref&gt; Over one hundred exoplanets (as planets outside our solar system are called) have been found to date, a number that is being added to every few weeks. Undoubtedly, with time and as astronomers refine their planet-finding techniques, many more will be discovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Earth was formed (as were all of the planets in our solar system) from the aggregates that orbited our sun approximately 4.6 billion y.a.—less than half a billion years after the sun itself formed (and about 9 billion years after the Big Bang). As it was forming, the Earth’s accumulating mass was constantly bombarded by matter-adding meteorites, comets and huge planetesimals (mini-planets), and this, together with the energy released by radioactive decay of the heavy elements that settled to its core,&lt;ref&gt;The same process (i.e., radioactive decay of elements such as plutonium) is used to provide heat (subsequently converted into electrical energy) in satellites sent to inspect planets that are too remote from the sun to allow effective use of solar panels.&lt;br/&gt;
It is conjectured that radioactive elements in the Earth’s core created an atomic reactor that still operates, keeping the core molten even though heat is continually being lost through the Earth’s mantle. See Brad Lemley, “Nuclear Planet,” Discover, August 2002, 36-42. For information on naturally occurring nuclear reactors, see http://nuclearplanet.com.&lt;/ref&gt; kept our planet in a molten state for its first two or three hundred million years. The Earth’s solid surface crust formed about four and a quarter billion y.a.&lt;ref&gt;Calculations involving the rate of radioactive decay, as well as the amount and kind of decay products, give scientists one method of dating the Earth’s beginning. For instance, analysis of the decay products of uranium isotopes found locked within zircon crystals from the Jack Hills section of north-western Australia, shows that these particular crystals are between 4.3 and 4.4 billion years old.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, our planet consists chiefly of a liquid iron alloy core (at a temperature of approximately 5,000&amp;deg;C&lt;ref&gt;Just a little cooler than the temperature at the sun’s surface. (The temperature of the sun’s core is very much hotter—about 16,000,000&amp;deg;C.)&lt;/ref&gt;), covered by a mantle of hardened oxides that float on the core’s surface. The core is slowly cooling as convection currents and eddies in its upper layers transfer heat into the mantle. These currents also cause the Earth’s continents to drift, almost imperceptibly, but constantly. In several places, subterranean tectonic plates bump into each other, inevitably pushing one under the other. The uppermost plate (usually the lightest one) lifts to form mountains, with rifts, or valleys, forming in between. The plate pushed underneath remelts to form magma, some of which may find its way to the surface again through volcanoes.

Most of the water that covers three-quarters of the Earth’s surface arrived in the form of comets early in our planet’s life, but another 500 tons or so is added daily as the Earth sweeps up space-dust (much of which is water&lt;ref&gt;See “The Sound of One Rock Falling,” ''Discover'', February 2002, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;). Water is ubiquitous throughout the universe simply because its constituents (two atoms of hydrogen, and one atom of oxygen) are elemental and universal—hydrogen being the first element formed following the Big Bang, and oxygen being one of the elements produced as stars evolve, and later thrown into space as they nova.

As we doubtless remember from our school days, the sun’s radiation evaporates water (that then condenses to form the clouds that produce rain, lightning and thunder). The sun’s energy also heats the land and sea; temperature differences between these create winds and drive the water cycle that sustains life on land.

More than three billion years of continuously varying weather has eroded the Earth’s ever-changing mountains, turning their rock into the sand, dust and silt that have become major constituents of our planet’s soil and the bottoms of its lakes, rivers and oceans. Silt and material on the ocean floors, compressed by the weight of water and accumulated matter above, has formed layers of sedimentary rock that trap and hold evidence of the conditions and life forms that existed from the recent past to many hundreds of millions of years ago. Ice locked at depths within glaciers provides ancient liquids and gases that scientists have collected and analyzed, further adding to what is known about how our planet aged and changed. These sources have also told us much of what is known about how life evolved on our planet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although we can conjecture, we are never likely to find out what caused the Big Bang; that is, what created our universe in the first place. The reason this is so is to be found in at least two places: Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem, and General Systems theory. These are not too hard to understand in outline, as the brief summary given in the next two paragraphs aims to show. (A little more information is provided in two [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws|postscripts]] to this chapter .)

In his Incompleteness Theorem, Kurt Gödel proved that no system can contain all of the information needed to answer every question that can be posed from within that system. No matter how much we understand about the system we are examining from within, logical paradoxes will always exist. Asking what started our universe is posing just such a logical paradox.

General Systems theory states that all systems are either open or closed. Open systems interact with (and obtain what they need to continue their existence from) their supersystem.&lt;ref&gt;A “purpose” of sorts can also be determined within open systems by examining the “feedback” received from their significant supersystem. Outputs that are accepted imply that the supersystem “wants” more of the same, thus providing a “purpose” or reason to continue their production. Outputs that are rejected by the supersystem cannot be exchanged for needed supplies so production must eventually cease. Thus, production of acceptable outputs (i.e., fulfilling the “purpose” of meeting the supersystem’s requirements) is a necessity for continued existence. (However, we should note that large supersystems, such as our biosphere, can tolerate lengthy periods of non-productivity [and even negative contributions] from a portion of their subsystems, just as organizations can from a few of their employees. This buffering capacity can disguise the true state of affairs and “false purposes” may be followed for long periods of time before becoming apparent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]] for further elaboration of these concepts.&lt;/ref&gt; Closed systems are cut-off from the outside, and no energy of any form (e.g., radiation, matter, or information) can enter or leave such a system. All our current theories suggest that our universe is a closed system, and, if this is so, we will never be able to obtain information from outside.

As humans, we try and find the root of every happening.  We can almost propose a theory and explanation as to what started most things that exist on our planet and also to visible objects within our system.  It is logical throughout history and the start of time, that every occurrence was the result of chain reaction event.  The big question is, what started the big bang.  Nothing can create itself or other entities without something else existing before it to start that chain reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The universe is not quite as mysterious as it once appeared to be. Cosmologists and astronomers now understand a great deal about its past, present and future, as well as what creates and controls its contents. Using computers and instruments to analyze photons collected by different types of telescopes, it is possible to infer what was likely to have been happening when these photons were created, and even what energies and matters were encountered in their journey through space and time. As we progress in this manner, we find that the science of cosmology depends upon—in fact, mostly is—the physics of energy and matter. In other words, the behaviour of the gigantic is controlled by the properties of the minuscule, the ultimate test of reality’s rational conformity to causality.&lt;ref&gt;This is not as surprising as it may at first seem, because, if superstring theory is correct, absolutely everything in existence is built from miniscule, vibrating, energy fields.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there appears to be no method of peeking through a singularity. If this is so, then no future beings, wherever they might live in the universe, will ever discover what caused the Big Bang, or what existed before time in this universe began.

This could be where a god once lived—or even lives now. If one exists anywhere at all, then this is the only place that modern science would position him—before the beginning, and beyond any possibility of interfering with the present.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, if any religion placed God in this position and was content to have Him play no part in our affairs, then such a religion would survive any form of investigation or attack. (But then, such a God wouldn’t meet our current psychological needs at all.)&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, there is proving to be no physical need for a god’s intervention within our universe. Once a universe possessing the properties we are discovering has been created, it will simply evolve in the manner our telescopes reveal, with stars, galaxies and planets (and life, as the next chapter explains) being formed along the way. A god’s influence is seemingly not needed in the day-to-day operation of the physical universe. But isn’t that to be expected of a creation if God Himself designed it?&lt;ref&gt;And surely any Designing God must have therefore also desired all to unfold exactly as it does. In such a case, it could be considered rather impertinent of us to ask Him to intervene to satisfy our own fleeting desires.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well, so much for the universe. It started, and it evolves as time goes by. We don’t know why it began or even if its existence requires a cause,&lt;ref&gt;If the universe is simply part of something that has always existed, then the reason it exists needs no explanation—the continued existence of something needs no more accounting for than the continued existence of nothing. Only changes of state need explaining (for example, where something exists which did not exist before).&lt;/ref&gt; but we do know a lot about how and why it evolves, and the forces that regulate its development.

It is time to turn our attention to the phenomenon of life, and review what scientists can tell us about it. Two questions are most important to our discussions: how did life begin, and how has it given rise to the forms we see today? The next chapter will review the answers that have been found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who has not looked at the sky on a starry, cloudless night and felt the wonder of living on a planet surrounded by so many mysterious shining points of light? Two thousand years ago, many thought that most of these were merely copies of each other, and that they were positioned on one of several “shells” which surrounded the Earth—a very uninspiring arrangement. We now know how incorrect that view was, and any reasonably good backyard telescope can provide hints about how our new perspective was obtained. It can be seen that these points of light are not all the same: many vary in brightness, some possess tinges of colour, and, while most hardly ever change their position relative to one another, a few move about from one night to the next, and the whole rotates with the time and season.

Even four hundred years ago it was not generally known that the Earth and planets are satellites of the sun. Although the Greek astronomer Aristarchus (around 250 BCE) had guessed as much, most preferred to believe otherwise. The Catholic Church had adopted Aristotle’s cosmology, and it maintained that three concentric spheres or “shells” encompassed the Earth, with the sun and moon moving on the surface of the first sphere, the planets moving on the second, and all of the stars being at rest on the third.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, the Greek philosopher whose ideas influenced the whole of the western world for over two thousand years, proposed this arrangement circa 350 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; This conformed to the notion that a perfect heaven awaited above (while volcanoes and hot springs were said to prove that hell and brimstone lay beneath). There is a well-known story of how Galileo,&lt;ref&gt;Galileo is the Italian philosopher and scientist (1564-1642) who is also famous for dropping balls of different weights from the Tower of Pisa. (Thus again proving that Aristotle was wrong. Aristotle had stated that heavy objects fall faster than light ones.)&lt;/ref&gt; after careful use of a telescope he had constructed, declared in 1616 that Copernicus was right and that the Earth and planets did revolve around the sun; this led to the Church placing Galileo under house arrest for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo was lucky that nothing worse was ordered for him. A few decades before, in February 1600, an Italian philosopher-monk named Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake by the Catholic Church for saying that the Earth moved around the sun. (Bruno also thought, as Epicurus did, that the universe must contain other planets that orbited distant stars.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasing use of telescopes gradually altered popular opinion, and by the middle of the seventeenth century most astronomers agreed that the sun-centred description was correct.

A six-inch telescope and some careful scrutiny will uncover numerous small, fuzzy patches of light in the night sky. Careful observation at higher magnifications shows that these are actually collections of stars, or galaxies. Galaxies, typically comprising thousands of millions of stars, mostly appear in one of three arrangements: elliptical, spiral&lt;ref&gt;About three-quarters of observed galaxies are spiral, with arms containing enormous quantities of dust (the birthplace and material of new stars). Spiral galaxies (and possibly all others) appear to contain an unknown dark matter (whose possible presence explains why stars in galaxies rotate faster than can be accounted for by the observable matter within their galaxies).

Current theories hold that dark matter constitutes about thirty percent of the total matter within the universe. Observations made using the Hubble telescope suggest that much of the dark matter associated with galaxies may be due to the presence of ancient white dwarfs (the burnt-out remnants of normal stars). Dark matter has been detected and mapped by observing its gravitational-lensing effects upon the shapes of some 200,000 distant galaxies; it appears to be distributed in a honey-comb-like manner throughout the universe.&lt;/ref&gt; or irregular. Astronomers further find (through careful examination of photographs taken using giant telescopes) that galaxies themselves collect together in groups and clusters, and that these clumps form even bigger collections. The size of these massive groupings (called superclusters&lt;ref&gt;See “The Evolution of Galaxy Clusters,” by J. Patrick Henry, Ulrich G. Briel and Hans Bohringer in ''Scientific American'', December 1998, 52-57.&lt;/ref&gt; and galaxy walls) can exceed many hundreds of millions of light-years.

Astronomers have also observed several pairs of galaxies colliding. This sounds catastrophic, but it produces nowhere near the (relative) damage caused, for example, when comets or asteroids crash into planets. This is because galaxies are vast (which is another way of saying that they are mostly empty space) and one galaxy can pass right through another with relatively few direct impacts (orbital disruptions would be much more likely to happen).&lt;ref&gt;Andromeda, a spiral galaxy just 2.2 million light-years away, is expected to collide with our galaxy in approximately two billion years' time.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of dark patches are also noticeable in the night sky, areas which seem to be devoid of light-emitting stars. One well-known dark region can be seen in the Great Orion Nebula forming part of Orion’s sword and lies some 1500 light-years away. (The reason such dark patches exist is explained in [[../The Life Of A Typical Star/]].)

Stars, galaxies, superclusters, and other objects in the universe have been photographed, numbered, catalogued and intensively studied for decades. Their brilliance, variabilities, emissions, compositions, movements, ages, and much else, have been repeatedly measured by a wide range of very powerful instruments. Over years of study, it has been found that most objects and phenomena can be grouped into categories, and these have been given names (for example, white and brown dwarfs, red giants, neutron stars, gas giants, black holes, Cepheids, pulsars, quasars, novae, supernovae, and so on). Much has been learned in just a few decades about the nature and properties of members of each category, but a great deal more remains to be discovered.

By studying the variations in intensity of emitted radiation, astronomers have found how to measure the distance between Earth and a particular kind of varying star called a Cepheid variable. By associating these stars with galaxies, it has been determined that the light from the most distant galaxies has been travelling for more than thirteen billion years! This means that, when viewing those galaxies, we are looking at something that is about 12x10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kilometres away (calculated by multiplying the distance light travels in one year by 13 billion), and, perhaps more significantly, it means we are seeing light that was emitted from them as they existed over thirteen billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Our sun is less than half this age.&lt;/ref&gt; To see these galaxies as they exist today, we would have to wait another thirteen billion years for their current emissions to reach Earth (or we would have to instantaneously travel 12x10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kilometres to where they are, an impossibility). Knowing how far an object is from Earth has allowed astronomers to “look into the past”—the farther away a celestial entity is, the older the light we are seeing. Thus, the properties of distant objects can be examined and compared to closer (i.e., younger) emitting bodies. Such analyses have led to many meaningful discoveries about the origins of our universe and its evolution over time.

Some eighty years ago astronomers discovered that the spectral emissions&lt;ref&gt;Newton (1642-1727) was the first to scientifically investigate why white light, when passed through a glass prism, splits into a rainbow-like band of colours (called a spectrum). His writings nicely demonstrate how much can be deduced from careful observation of a seemingly minor phenomenon. (This text can be read in a sidebar (“Newton on Light and Colors”) under “Newton, Sir Isaac” in the ''Encarta Reference Library 2002'' (Microsoft Corporation).&lt;/ref&gt; from all distant objects are displaced, i.e., that their spectral dark bands&lt;ref&gt;Spectra often show patterns of dark bands. These bands are caused by the absence (or presence) of chemical elements, either in the emitting source or along the path that the light has taken. This property is used by instruments called spectrometers to detect and measure the presence of minute traces of chemicals, and has applications in forensic, industrial, and research laboratories, as well as astronomical observatories.&lt;/ref&gt; have been shifted from their normal position. All galactic radiation (except that coming from a few, nearby, galaxies) shows spectral lines that have been moved toward the red end of the spectrum; this has been termed the “red shift.”&lt;ref&gt;A shift toward the red end of the spectrum means that the wavelength of light has increased (i.e., has been stretched out) as its source moves away from us. We are all familiar with this as we hear its effects with sound waves. Sound from a police car siren or from the horn of a train, for example, is heard at a higher pitch as the source moves toward us (because this forward movement compresses the sound waves and they arrive at our ears more closely spaced together);  as the source passes by and moves away from us, the pitch rapidly drops to a lower frequency. Wave frequency change due to relative motion is called the Doppler effect.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been found to occur in every direction we look, and means that all distant objects are moving away from us. In fact, the farther away an object is, the faster it recedes.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Hubble (1889-1951) showed this in 1929 by graphing galactic red shift against their distance from the Milky Way. (The Hubble Space Telescope was so named to honour the discoverer of this very significant observation.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, for those who would have otherwise, this does not make us unique. Although it seems to place the Earth (and therefore humanity) at the centre of the universe, this is not the case. The true explanation is that everything is moving away from everything else, because the intervening space is expanding rather than the objects themselves moving. (They do move, of course, just as our planet moves around our sun. Our sun travels around the centre of our galaxy, and galaxies themselves move. But galactic recession is due to space expansion. Space expansion is perhaps most clearly visualized using the analogy of specks of dirt on the surface of a balloon. When the balloon is inflated, the distance between each speck increases, and those furthest apart separate at the greatest speed, but no speck is more centrally positioned than any other.)

Finding that billions of galaxies exist, each containing billions of stars, has been exciting. Finding that they are speeding away from each other was at first unbelievable, then astonishing, and it immediately claimed the attention of all cosmologists. This galactic recession (or expansion of the universe, which is another way of saying the same thing) was so fundamental and far-reaching an observation that few astronomers could concentrate upon any other issue—an explanation had to be found.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Life’s development has been much harder to definitively trace than that of the universe. This is because biology’s countless combinations and permutations are exceedingly convoluted compared to the linearity of physics or the predictability of chemistry.

Experimental physics is often conducted by holding all variables constant, then determining the effects of changing just one. This procedure, together with the universe’s constraints (which limit the number of particles [such as protons or electrons] there are to investigate and the number of ways they can behave) has simplified the discovery of many of the universe’s secrets. Physicists now extrapolate with confidence from present to past, from past to future, and from here to the other side of the universe.

Chemistry is somewhat more complex than physics, because there are over a hundred chemical elements. This relatively large number means that millions of different combinations (as molecules and compounds) can exist. This complexity is being conquered, however, as demonstrated by the near-routine formulation of new and improved fabrics, explosives, alloys, drugs, plastics, and innumerable other products.

Progress in biology, on the other hand, has been considerably slower until just recently. Life’s ability to mutate and change over successive generations has meant that investigators cannot simply extrapolate backwards to determine what previously existed, nor look forward and predict what might result.

Most of our knowledge about life’s history has been obtained from fossils and preserved remnants of past life forms, but two factors greatly complicate the task. First, biotic matter provides food for other living things, so most of it never makes its way into the future to be studied. Second, the extensive (and ongoing) geophysical changes that the Earth has undergone during its more than four billion years of existence has left the story-telling remains of life’s progress fragmented and incomplete. However, enough evidence  exists and has been found for scientists to trace life’s gross history on this planet. Moreover, each year new fossils and new facts (particularly genetic) about past and present inter- and intra-species relationships are discovered. These fill knowledge gaps and build confidence in the accuracy of what has already been deduced. What biologists now generally accept is related in the following pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the first theories to become widely known that described how life may have begun on this planet was proposed in the 1920’s independently by Aleksandr Oparin, a Russian biochemist, and J. B. S. Haldane, a British biologist. They pointed out that some four billion years ago, conditions in the Earth’s shallower seas and oceans would have resembled a chemical vat. This vat must have held a variety of ingredients that would have been warmed by sunlight, constantly stirred by tides and winds, bathed in ultraviolet radiation from the sun, and intermittently subjected to electrical discharges from thunder storms. This so-called called “primordial soup” would inevitably have become more complex over time, as interactions (mostly chemical) between the constituents occurred. Eventually, it would likely contain many of the molecules and compounds needed to create some elemental forms of life.

Stanley Miller, under Harold Urey at the University of Chicago in 1953, recreated many of these conditions in the laboratory. Together they subjected methane, ammonia and hydrogen (gases that very probably existed on this planet in its early years, and that are still present in abundance on Jupiter and Saturn) to electrical sparks in a sealed sterile flask. On later analyzing the flask’s contents, they found many of the amino acids from which life’s building blocks—proteins—are built.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Bernal’s book, ''The Origin of Life'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967) provides a classic account and critical discussion of what was known in the 1960s about the origin of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many books have been written about life’s origin, more recently including:
*David W. Deamer and Gail R. Fleischaker, ''Origins of Life: The Central Concepts'' (Sudbury, Massachusetts: Jones and Bartlett, 1994).
*John H. Holland, ''Emergence From Chaos to Order'' (Helix Books, 1998).
*Noam Lahav, ''Biogenesis: Theories of Life’s Origin'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar experiments have since yielded molecular components of proteins that regulate carbohydrate and fat formation. In other words, some of the major constituents of life have been fabricated from scratch in the laboratory.

However, it is equally possible that life on this planet began thousands of meters beneath the sea’s surface, in total darkness. Clues to this conjecture have been found in north-western Australia, in sulphur-rich rocks that retain micro-fossils of single-celled organisms over three and a quarter billion years old. These rocks possess mineral structures that reveal they originated close to hot springs on the sea floor.

In 1977, a mid-ocean ridge of hot springs was discovered encircling the globe. The wealth of chemicals and nutrients it supplies nourishes a complex ecosystem of over 500 species, from bacteria to tube worms and crabs.

The energy source that sustains this web of life is the oxidization of hydrogen sulphide in a process called chemosynthesis (as opposed to photosynthesis, whereby sunlight powers life on the Earth’s surface). Experiments at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution determined that when similar physical (high-pressure, turbulence, completely dark, etc.) and chemical conditions are constructed in the laboratory, large organic molecules containing over thirty carbon atoms form in less than a day. Thus, life on Earth may have first begun in the sunless depths of its oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Miniscule microbes (about one thousandth of a millimetre in length) that possess membranes and DNA have also been found living in solid rock, at temperatures over 150º Centigrade, five kilometres underground. These probably developed from life forms that existed when the rocks formed. See “It’s a small world after all,” Discover, January 2001, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, life may have begun as some form of methanogen.&lt;ref&gt;Other theories relating to the origin of life are mentioned in the [[../../Origin Theory Modifications|postscript to this chapter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Methanogens are microbes that obtain energy by converting hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane. Very few such organisms exist in any of Earth’s typical, oxygen-abundant, environments (because methanogens are consumed by the more-efficient carbon life forms that now occupy these niches), but a complete food-chain community of them has been found in Idaho living in 58°C water two hundred meters underground. Presumably these have survived from very early times. Methanogen communities may have been common on this planet before oxygen in gaseous form became abundant (see [[../Development Of Life On Earth/]]) and they may also exist where conditions are similar, such as upon some of the sun’s other planets or moons, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;For more detail on this subject, see Michael Gross, ''Life on the Edge: Amazing creatures thriving in extreme environments'' (Perseus Publishing, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

While several situations and mechanisms might have given rise to life on this planet, it may in fact owe its origins to extraterrestrial events that first happened in water, frozen in space, long ago and far away. Although space temperatures average just 3° above absolute zero, recent experiments have found that amorphous ice (the kind that forms when water vapour freezes in a vacuum) flows when subjected to ultraviolet radiation (as it would be in space). In the laboratory, when carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methanol (gases all abundant in space) are dissolved in water before freezing to form amorphous ice, subsequent ultraviolet radiation produces hundreds of complex organic molecules. Moreover, if this frozen ice flows (or is melted or added to water), membranous vesicles (similar to those found in the 1969 Murchison meteorite&lt;ref&gt;Meteorites are fragments of asteroids that did not become part of the solar system’s planets, and they carry information that depicts what existed at the time of their formation. The Murchison meteorite was extensively examined in 1997 and found to contain an excess of left-handed amino acids—the same bias that life on Earth exhibits.&lt;/ref&gt;) are formed, together with even more complex compounds (some able to convert ultraviolet energy to visible light).
 
Laboratory findings such as these are reinforced through data collected by the European Space Agency’s satellite Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). When scrutinizing selected objects, the ISO can detect the emission of infrared rays at particular wavelengths, revealing the presence of identifiable atoms, molecules and solids. These data show that complex, ring-structured, aromatic molecules form in the regions surrounding very old stars, over the relatively short period of a thousand years or so. Spectral analysis of interstellar dusts and gases have identified hundreds of different organic compounds, including amino acids of the type needed to build life’s proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Amino acids in space show a slight predominance of left-handedness. (N.B. Miller-type experiments produce equal-handed amino acids.)&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, sugar molecules (glycolaldehyde) have been spectroscopically detected in the dust clouds near the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. (What makes this finding particularly interesting is that such molecules can combine with other molecules to form ribose and glucose; ribose molecules are utilized in the construction of DNA and RNA.)

All these findings strongly suggest that life’s precursors, including cell-like sacs containing organic compounds, could have been formed many billions of years ago&lt;ref&gt;And may still be forming.&lt;/ref&gt; in space, and would therefore be part of all comets, asteroids and planets from their very beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;See “Life’s Far-Flung Raw Materials” by Max. P. Bernstein, Scott A. Sandford and Louis J. Allamandola, in the July 1999 edition of ''Scientific American'', 42-49.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">While we don’t definitively know where life first developed, we do know approximately when it first appeared on Earth—it showed up less than a quarter of a billion years after the Earth’s crust had formed. In other words, just about as soon as it could.&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that complex (i.e., multicellular) life forms could not have existed anywhere in our universe during the first third or so of its life. It takes several billion years for most stars to burn, then collapse, so producing the novae and supernovae that make and release the heavier chemical elements that partly constitute all planets and life as we know it. It has taken another four billion years for life on this planet to evolve into us. Complex life is a relative late-comer to the universe’s party.&lt;/ref&gt;

For reasons noted in the introduction to this chapter, early evidence of life is hard to come by.&lt;ref&gt;See Sarah Simpson, “Questioning the Oldest Signs of Life,” ''Scientific American'', April 2003, 70-77, for a recent review of this topic.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, indirect evidence suggests that it was present at least 3.7 billion years ago. This has been deduced from an analysis of rocks dating to that age, found on an island close to Greenland. These rocks contain a higher carbon-12 to carbon-13 isotopic ratio than chemical and physical processes alone would create. (Life processes prefer the lighter isotopes, and this concentrates carbon-12 where life exists.) More direct evidence, in the form of fossil micro-organisms, has been discovered in sedimentary rocks from Iceland that are between 3.7 and 3.8 billion years old. (Iceland is particularly suitable for finding early life forms because its rocks have not been greatly disturbed by geological processes during the intervening ages.)

Many of us were taught in school that there are three kingdoms of life on this planet.&lt;ref&gt;Research carried out by some two hundred scientists from a dozen countries led them to recently state that there are at least five major kingdoms: animals, fungi, green plants, red plants, and brown plants. Their classification is based upon cladistics, a method that groups organisms according to evolutionary characteristics that are genetically shared with a common ancestor. (This contrasts with traditional classification methods whereby life forms are grouped according to the postulated relative importance of shared physical characteristics.)&lt;br/&gt;
Undeniably genetic tracing is the more accurate method. However, it is likely that the traditional classification system will continue to be used for many years to come—the scientific nomenclature that has developed over the centuries based upon these approaches is too vast to be revised very quickly.&lt;br/&gt;
The modern “family network” (rather than “family tree”) is sketched in the article, “Deciphering the Code of Life” by Francis S. Collins and Karin G. Jegalian (''Scientific American'', December 1999, 90). It looks markedly different from those traditionally shown in school.&lt;br/&gt;
Ian Tattersall, in “Once We Were Not Alone,” ''Scientific American'', January 2000, diagrams (on page 60) the latest thinking about our own (the hominid) family tree. The essay is accompanied by two lovely illustrations of early life painted by Jay H. Matternes. The subsequent issue of this journal (February 2000) outlines the relationships between bacteria, Archaea and eukaryotes. (See in particular W. Ford Doolittle’s article, “Uprooting the Tree of Life,” 90-95.)&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest and most ancient are called the Archaea (otherwise known as archaebacteria, the first cells).

Archaean kingdom representatives were first discovered in volcanic vents on the floor of the Pacific ocean,&lt;ref&gt;Archaea have now been found to be living in many other environments—animal intestines, compost piles, and marshes, for instance.&lt;/ref&gt; three kilometres deep off the Galápagos Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Hydrothermal vents are likely to exist on any planet having a hot core and water. (Possibly most planets possess these two features during their early years, with some retaining them for most of their lives). If so, primitive Archaea-type life forms may be abundant throughout the universe.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaea and very primitive bacteria are autotrophic (that is, they build their complex living molecules by chemosynthesis, a chemical process mentioned in the previous section).

The second kingdom, the Prokarya, are a later development; they consist of life forms whose cells lack internal membranes (and thus have no nuclei).

Prokaryotic life was flourishing within the Earth’s shallow oceans as blue-green algae (a.k.a. cyanobacteria), over three and a half billion years ago. Once formed, the anaerobic&lt;ref&gt;Anaerobic: not requiring air or oxygen. Cyanobacteria still exist and can be found in water and soil, on trees and on rocks. Mats of floating cyanobacteria frequently form mound-like structures called stromatolites. Fossil stromatolites date from all ages, including back to 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;/ref&gt; cyanobacteria began dumping its photosynthetic by-product, oxygen, into the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere, and continued to do so without much competition for over two billion years. Eventually a new form of bacteria evolved that was able to use this oxygen through a process we call aerobic respiration; this opened the way for the more complex (and more energy-demanding), nucleated, eukaryotic cells to evolve. (Bacteria, of course, still exist in abundance everywhere conditions permit, and they still lack cell nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells is discussed by Christian de Duve in “The Birth of Complex Cells,” ''Scientific American'', April 1996, 50-57.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The third kingdom, the Eukarya, first appeared about two billion years ago. The cells of eukaryotic life forms contain membrane-bound nuclei, and all plants and animals (including humans) belong to this kingdom.

While one billion years ago the continents were still barren (with the possible exception of primitive algae), the seas teemed with unicellular life. Many of these life forms reproduced asexually through division, although some used sexual means. About 700 m.y.a. (million years ago), multicellular sea plants appeared. They rapidly developed in form and prevalence as they made the most of their added capabilities. Multicellular sea plants stayed at the forefront of life’s evolution until the beginning of the Cambrian era, about 540 m.y.a., when multiple forms of marine animals developed from simpler varieties of roundworms. This transition occurred because possession of body cavities and an alimentary canal allowed worm-like creatures to grow more than a few cells thick (as nutrients and waste materials could now be readily passed between internal cells and the external environment). Larger bodies meant that supporting structures would be valuable adaptations, and any that evolved would be retained. The first vertebrates developed soon thereafter (about 500 m.y.a.).

By 400 m.y.a., plants, fungi and primitive arthropods (invertebrates, similar to crabs or lobsters, having an external skeleton and jointed appendages) had colonized the ocean shores and moved inland. (The ongoing evolution of early arthropods eventually produced spiders, centipedes and insects.) Around this time, fish utilized their swim bladders and fins to spend temporary periods on land. These organs gradually evolved into lungs and legs, and the animal class known as amphibians arose. The fluid-filled amniotic sacs we call eggs allowed amphibians to reproduce and give birth on dry land, and some later evolved into reptiles, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and turtles.

The earliest mammals appeared some 200 m.y.a., evolving from a group of reptiles called therapsids. These mammals were small (about five centimetres long) and possibly lived in trees during the dinosaur age. They remained rodent-like creatures&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps those that grew larger became more readily visible and excessively preyed upon.&lt;/ref&gt; until the dinosaurs became extinct 65 m.y.a. One branch of these early mammals evolved (some 30 m.y.a.) to become Proconsul, our hominoid ape ancestor, and their descendants became the gibbons, orang-utans, gorillas and chimpanzees we know today. About six million years ago, the ape and hominid lineages separated; today our closest living relatives are Central African chimpanzees (demonstrated and verified by comparative DNA sequencing&lt;ref&gt;More than 98% of human genes are identical to those possessed by chimpanzees. (Thus we can effectively resuscitate the “missing links” any time we want—by way of the petri dish and molecular genetic techniques. The recipe would be: take one chimp zygote, replace those DNA portions that differ from ours with human DNA, return to the womb and wait. Turning one human race into another should be even easier: humans are over 99.9% genetically identical.)&lt;/ref&gt;).

The genus ''Homo'' appeared about two and a half m.y.a. (although stone tools have been found that date to earlier periods). Artifacts left by “technologically advanced” clans of early humans (who used stone tools to chip bones and antlers into refined shapes) have been found in Israel’s Dead Sea Rift Valley and dated definitively&lt;ref&gt;Via Earth’s magnetic field reversal.&lt;/ref&gt; to 780,000 years ago.

Neandertals (who first appeared in Europe about 200,000 y.a. and whose ancestors were hominids who moved from Africa to Europe some 500,000 y.a.) holed up in valleys to survive the ice ages and so avoided the many challenges that constant moves would have brought. Perhaps as a result, their tools changed little during most of their existence, and this suggests that their intelligence also did not greatly change. However, fossilized bone structures show that Neandertals did have the means to utter words, and they probably developed and used simple languages.

The tools and ornaments of ''Homo sapiens'', on the other hand, changed greatly over very short periods of time. Our species first appeared in Africa over 100,000 y.a. and moved into Europe (as Cro-Magnon) around 40,000 y.a., and they seemed to have confronted and surmounted the various challenges successive ice ages introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Long before our species appeared, however, the brain pan size of early ''Homo'' ancestors began enlarging. This size change, occurring about two million years ago, could be related to the development of language, but, since complex languages probably did not develop until later (see [[../../Thinking/Third-Level Thinking And Language|Third-Level Thinking And Language]]), it is more likely that the increase was a result of the changes introduced by the onset of the ice ages. Having to cope in a frozen environment would have rapidly increased the number of life-threatening problems to be addressed. Larger brain pans in and of themselves do not improve problem solving, but, if the genetic mutation that first brought them into existence also caused an increase in the number of neurons grown, this would. Greater problem-solving ability enhances survival, and the mutated genes that produced a larger brain pan (able to accommodate additional neurons) would have been passed on to subsequent generations.&lt;br/&gt;
(Several forces favour smaller heads [not the least being birth canal dimensions] and brain pans stopped enlarging about 200,000 years ago. Possibly word use [and the communal problem solving that third-level thinking and language use encourages] reduced the requirement for further enlargements.)&lt;/ref&gt;

How do we know these things? Specimens of life and associated artifacts have been trapped in muddy sediments, chalk, glacial ice,&lt;ref&gt;The Vostok ice core from Antarctica contains records that date back to 420,000 years ago.&lt;/ref&gt; peat bogs, dry sandy deserts, tree resin&lt;ref&gt;More than a dozen intriguing photographs of insects entombed in fossilized resin are printed in “Captured in Amber,” by David A. Grimaldi (''Scientific American'', April 1996, 84–91). DNA from plant and insect life preserved in amber for some 125 million years has been sequenced (i.e., the nucleotide order determined), adding to our understanding of evolution’s pathways.&lt;/ref&gt; etc., for millions of years. These entombments often preserve complete specimens in date-stamped strata for scientists to examine.&lt;ref&gt;See J. William Schopf, ''Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth’s Earliest Fossils'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999) for a description of the beginnings and development of the science of precambrian paleobiology.&lt;/ref&gt; Painstaking observations over many decades combined with more recent sophisticated analytical techniques (such as DNA analysis and various imaging techniques) consistently show that life’s development demonstrates an overall progressive trend from simple to complex.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Francoeur, ''Evolving World, Converging Man'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1970) provides a nice summary that, in less than twenty pages, describes life’s gradual changes from its beginnings to the rise of man. By letting one day represent a fourteen million year time period, he compresses the more than 3.5 billion years of life’s history on Earth into a one-year time-line. On this scale the Cambrian Period (when most of the major animal groups first appeared) corresponds to November 16–25, and the Jurassic (dinosaur) Age lasts from December 19–22. Early man does not appear until 6:30 p.m. on December 31 (the equivalent of 3 m.y.a. on this one-year time-line). Many similar accounts are in print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Millennia ago, humans realized that greatly different animals (deer, birds and fish, for example) possess body organs and systems very similar to their own, but could not explain why. Over the centuries various explanations were proposed, some theological, some scientific; two centuries ago most people accepted the theological interpretation—that life in its different forms was Created. Papers read to the Linnean Society in 1858 written by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace (who had independently reached similar conclusions) did little to change this situation—attendees simply did not understand the importance of what they were hearing. However, when Darwin’s book ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'', was published a year later, evolution became a topic of discussion for every learned person and things changed forever.&lt;ref&gt;Every copy of Darwin’s book was sold the first day it came out. It has been called “the book that shook the world.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a readily accessible series of more recent discussions about Darwin and life’s evolution, visit www.pbs.org and link to “evolution” at www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is easy to understand what immediately happened. Darwin and his ideas were ridiculed by almost everyone; scientists said he could not prove what he was saying, and the religious said that mankind was created—as proven by texts in the Bible. Humans simply could not be “descended from an ape.”

Darwin’s work, and its attendant publicity, resulted in widespread use of the words “evolution” and “natural selection.” These terms are sometimes treated as though they hold the same significance—they do not. One is a fact, the other is a theory, and we should take a moment to discuss the differences between the two.

There is plenty of evidence to show that evolution occurred—is still occurring—and that all life on this planet is interrelated, with a common ancestry. Palaeontologists study fossils of once-living organisms, and their work demonstrates that the bones and structures of ancient life forms gradually changed over time. Comparative studies of the physical and systemic structures of living plants and animals uncover the same kind of gradual change. Genetic mapping&lt;ref&gt;Eukaryotic organisms (i.e., plants and animals) possess intracellular structures called mitochondria which process chemical molecules obtained from food to release their energy. Mitochondria possess their own DNA (called mitochondrial DNA, or mDNA) which is passed directly from mother to child and does not vary between generations unless some random mutation occurs. The mutations that do occur can be used to trace a species’ history, as well as relationships between different species. By this means, the progression from one original organism to subsequent divergent organisms can be uncovered.&lt;/ref&gt; adds to the information obtained, and shows beyond any possible doubt that links between living species, and between living and extinct species, exist.&lt;ref&gt;Scientists, for instance, have mapped the entire genome of the Archaean microbe known as ''Methanococcus jannaschii''. This information, together with the genomes of representatives of the Prokarya and Eukarya kingdoms, may eventually allow us to find the genes common to all living things—that is, some of the genes possessed by the universal ancestor of life on this planet. It may only be a matter of time before a map can be drawn that will show definitive interconnections between all Earthly life forms. This will concurrently trace the major features of the full evolutionary route to ''Homo sapiens''. (Genetic tracing becomes difficult in bacteria, however, because they are able to transfer genes laterally, i.e., directly from one to another. This suggests that we may have to be content with tracing life’s ancestry back no further than bacteria.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Scientists have already used mitochondrial DNA taken from five major ethnic groups which make up the current global human population to trace the ancestry of ''Homo sapiens'' back to a time between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago. We have all evolved from one or another of about one hundred or so woman, the “original Eves,” who lived in Africa. (And we should really repaint any of our pictures involving Eve that do not show her having very dark skin.)&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner, after discussing work done by Seymour Benzer and his wife in the 1980s, noted that flies, worms, seeds, yeasts and bacteria possess thousands of very similar genes or gene sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, ''Time, Love, Memory'', 184.
Surprisingly, the human genome contains around 30,000 genes, only about twice the number of genes possessed by a worm or a fruit fly. Several hundred of our genes turn out to be identical to those found in simple bacteria.&lt;/ref&gt; This could only have occurred if they all had a common ancestor. (In fact, a pre-Cambrian common ancestor must have existed, well over 540 m.y.a., for such widely separated species to possess so many similar genes.) Moreover, as Weiner pointed out, the genomes of mice and men (and women, if it needs to be stated) are about the same size and contain corresponding genes.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, ''ibid'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; (de Duve actually states&lt;ref&gt;de Duve, ''Vital Dust'', 112.&lt;/ref&gt; that the evidence showing all Earthly organisms to be descendants of one common ancestor is “overwhelming.”)

That evolution occurs is something animal and plant breeders have known and profited from for centuries, and it is a fact that few educated people today dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Human change today is likely to be occurring most rapidly in the mental, rather than the physical, arena. The most “mentally alert” individuals are the most likely to provide the broadest environment for their children to experience. These children will, as a consequence, likely learn more, in depth and variety, than their peers, thus becoming potentially better equipped for success in later life. Whether or not the descendants of the “most mentally alert” will create a sub-division that eventually becomes genetically built into ''H. sapiens’'' future will depend upon the environment—it must continue to provide a niche where this behaviour is rewarded by reproductive success. For instance, if humans eventually move out into space, it is likely to be the most mentally able that are chosen to go. If these space colonizers do succeed and multiply, then this kind of speciation may become a wide-spread, potentially dominant, reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Because social programs support the survival and reproduction of all, the genes of the “most mentally alert” individuals are unlikely to dominate on this planet in the foreseeable future [because individuals possessing such genes currently tend to have fewer children than others]. The fact that rational behaviour acts to eliminate the genes that result in this behaviour suggests that there is something irrational [possibly its sustainability] about the environment our current social programs create.)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, we can never be certain that we know all of the factors that ''cause'' evolution to occur, so any explanation of why evolution occurs may someday be modified or even overturned. While we have what we think is a very good idea, there could be additional or different reasons why evolution happens, so scientists continue to call this very good idea a theory. Natural selection&lt;ref&gt;Natural selection states, essentially, that offspring are never identical, and that those possessing advantageous variations are more likely than their less-advantaged siblings or peers to survive and procreate. These advantages are thereby passed in greater numbers to the next generation, and this causes all species to change over time. There is not much to dispute about any of these postulates.&lt;/ref&gt; is Darwin’s very good idea, and it has withstood all manner of challenges to its ability to explain and to predict. But it can be thrown into doubt, and even discredited, any time a fact of evolution is found that it cannot explain. (All scientific explanations are like this; any or all of them may one day be shown to be inadequate or inaccurate, and we remind ourselves of this limitation by calling many of them theories. All will remain theories forever.We continue to call Einstein’s masterpiece “The General Theory of Relativity,” but few state that it is just a “theory,” or that atomic bombs cannot exist.

“Laws,” too, including the Conservation Laws of physics, can be overthrown if negating proof is discovered.

(Never knowing if any “fact” or theory is entirely correct is a consequence of living within a [presumably] closed system. See the [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws]] for elaboration.)

Thus, that evolution occurs is a fact; however, the explanation why evolution occurs will always be called a theory. This, presumably, is why controversy continues. A few people, wilfully or mistakenly, capitalize upon the word “theory” to imply that the concept is untrue, and that evolution does not occur. What they might better state is that the natural selection explanation of why evolution occurs is a theory, good only until some better explanation is found.&lt;ref&gt;A certain amount of knowledge is needed to understand and appreciate what the theory of natural selection tells us about evolution. However, even those without such schooling still require some kind of explanation to account for life’s beginning and the presence of humankind. Creationism was developed to offer an explanation of sorts. It is an ancient idea that attempts to explain the unknown in a simple way. (All religions, if they are to be taken seriously, must explain how and why things are as we find them to be.) Unfortunately, Creationism ignores or attempts to refute too many evolutionary facts to be credible to anyone with an educated and impartial mind. Moreover, a belief in Creationism (like all beliefs) installs the opinion that one knows just as much as (and, often, even more than) is known by those who can call upon mountains of solid evidence that supports a different view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That a few hold creationist views wouldn’t particularly matter, if it were not for the fact that their belief forces them to influence what is taught to children. Currently, schools in the American states of Alabama, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington must teach that evolution is deemed to be no more significant than the belief that Creationists hold to be true (in spite of the mountains of credible evidence that support the former, and none that supports the latter). Still other schools deliberately leave evolution entirely off the curriculum to avoid controversy; they resort to teaching facts alone, and say nothing about the simplifying and edifying explanation that makes the existence of all we see in nature so logical and understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In our world so dependent upon scientific knowledge, Creationism is a capricious belief to support, and it is very likely to limit the future success of its believers. This may not matter to adults, but it hampers children, who have many years to live in a techno-medical society. Of course, in the long run, the fallacy is self-correcting—after all, we live in a universe where survival of the fittest gives preference to those whose actions fit the facts. Unfortunately, as noted in [[#cite_note-6|footnote 7]], it can only confer preference to those who act rationally when the immediately controlling environment is a rational one. This appears not to be the situation in a number of U.S. school boards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It may be necessary to articulate that science neither opposes nor supports religion—it simply tries to uncover and understand the facts as they are found to be. To refute the millions upon millions of pieces of evidence that reveal that life evolved (and that humans are just one consequence of this evolution) is foolhardy. Rational individuals might better ask themselves which is most likely to be the truth—that which was originally written by a few wishing to promote a particular belief, or that for which evidence can be found in tangible form, everywhere, by anyone who cares to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Read Robert T. Pennock, ''Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism'' (Boston: MIT Press, 1999) for a scholarly refutation of creationist ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the theme of this section, it is estimated that some two billion species have evolved on Earth during the past six hundred million years (the period for which we have some of the best fossil records, and during which all of our land life developed). Today, about 99.9% of these are extinct.

The two million species that exist today exhibit a multiplicity of forms. Variations range from the large, most-obviously complex, multi-system animals, down to the minute, single-celled, relatively simple bacteria. As might be expected, it is the tiniest of these which demonstrate the greatest diversity and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;A single DNA change in a one-celled life form will have a more profound effect, more often, than a single change in a many-celled life form. Thus, although many mutations may be inconsequential and some may be fatal, the few that are neither can result in the rapid diversification and adaptation of simple life forms. This is a common phenomenon in hospitals, where environments hostile to pathogens are routinely maintained—so this is where strains of bacteria able to resist the latest antibiotics keep cropping up.&lt;/ref&gt; The habitats of bacteria range from the plus 91°C boiling hot springs of Yellowstone Park, to the minus 50°C super-cooled brines found in the Antarctic. Bacteria also flourish under tremendous pressures on the ocean floor, spread prolifically throughout the soil we walk upon, waft through the air we breathe, and luxuriate in every kitchen.

When the papers written by Darwin and Wallace were first read,&lt;ref&gt;Darwin was ill at home and Wallace was collecting abroad at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; no one had seen evolution occurring. Today, experiments demonstrating its thesis can be conducted using fruit flies in high school science laboratories. Evolution was thought to be too slow to be witnessed in nature, but the real challenge to demonstrating its ubiquitous occurrence comes from the need to detect and measure small changes over a number of generations while also recording every possible factor that might relate to (or be causing) such changes.

Some of the earliest decisive documentation of evolution occurring in the wild was obtained by Peter and Rosemary Grant through studies of “Darwin’s” finches on the relatively isolated Galápagos island, Daphne Major. For more than two decades, the Grants, with the help of many colleagues, captured, numbered, precisely measured, banded, catalogued and released, almost every finch that lived on the island (sometimes only a few hundred, sometimes several thousand in a year). This period included years of drought, as well as wet and more normal years. In this manner, they recorded the features of close to 100,000 finches, together with many details about their varying habitats.&lt;ref&gt;See Jonathan Weiner, ''The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1994). A lovely book for anyone to read.&lt;/ref&gt;

These records were run through computer programs that sought correlations between the number and variety of finch, and changes in their environment such as rainfall, seed plant variety and abundance, and so on. Drought years drastically reduced the number of softer seeds, leaving the number of hard-shelled cactus seeds about the same. Finch species with large, strong beaks that were able to crack hard-shelled seeds, survived in stable numbers during those years, as might be expected. However, measurements of surviving members of the other finch species showed that only those whose beak was larger than average for their species were surviving and reproducing. The net result was that the beak size of each finch species drifted toward a larger and stronger shape during drought years. This drift continued in successive generations for as long as the drought continued. Wet years produced the opposite effect, and resulted in a drift within each species toward a finer beak structure (because the cactus plants began to die, and thinner beaks could better retrieve the smaller seeds of other plants that fell into the many tiny cracks in the island’s volcanic rocks).

Others have conducted parallel work. John Endler, for instance, working with guppies in various South American countries, observed natural generational variations in colour which were brought about by changes in the environment. Dark water favoured brilliance (better to attract females); light water favoured camouflage (better for hiding from predators).

Any change in an environment may affect species living within that environment. An accumulation of adaptations within one species eventually produces what becomes described as a new species. Collections of plant, animal and insect fossils in museums and universities around the world show that time, environmental change, and geographical separation are all that are needed for species to evolve from old into new.

Changes over time cause descendants to either diverge (i.e. increase in difference, one from another), or converge (i.e., increase in similarity). The factors that promote species divergence are predominately food (which favours the development of tools—for instance, the beak—that better exploit the particular kind of environment which supplies that food) and sex (which favours the development of partner-attracting displays or like-attracting-like matings). The forces that promote species convergence include the presence of enemies (which favours the development of camouflage and herd behaviours, the latter because there is safety in numbers) and the physical features of the environment being exploited. Hybridization, whereby closely related species merge genes, can produce fairly rapid convergence or divergence. The prevailing environment determines which outcome predominantly survives.

Evolution, we now realize, is often not a slow and gradual process. It can occur in small or large bursts, and these may be followed by long ages of slow consolidation.&lt;ref&gt;This chain of events is known as “punctuated equilibrium,” and has been popularized by Stephen Jay Gould, an influential evolutionary biologist and widely read author of many books.&lt;/ref&gt; A common sequence is as follows: an environmental calamity occurs, followed by a rapid collapse in food supplies. The calamity can be localized and relatively insignificant (a fallen rock, for instance) or something very pervasive (the eruption of an immense volcano, the impact of a large comet, or the rapid development of an ice age, for example). Each environmental change causes the death of some or perhaps almost all of the existing, previously well-adapted species.&lt;ref&gt;The fallen rock perhaps forces a nourishing stream to forge a different channel. The fine dust thrown into the atmosphere from a volcanic eruption or a comet’s impact might block sunlight for several years. Extensive ice sheets can prevent plant growth for centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in numbers of some species (or the environmental change itself) opens niches that were previously occupied, blocked, or non-existent, and this provides opportunities for suitably different members of surviving species to thrive.

The mutations that make life’s evolution and continuance possible need not be large, as the work with Darwin’s finches demonstrates. However, even drastically mutated offspring may survive and flourish under some kinds of environmental change. Evolutionary change following extinctions is rapid, because many of the previously well-adapted (and presumably competing species) completely die out. This may open niches accommodating to some of the more extreme variants (that might not otherwise have survived); without competition, they may now proliferate. Evolutionary change slows down again just as soon as successfully adapted species fill all available energy niches.&lt;ref&gt;Research suggests that biological recovery following any wide-spread ecological extinction takes an average of ten million years for complex animals, a relatively short period of time on the geological scale used to date fossils. (Recovery can be a matter of days, or even hours, for rapidly reproducing organisms such as bacteria.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Massive extinctions have not been uncommon in our planet’s history. Two of the more infamous were probably caused by asteroids or comets hitting the Earth. The first of these occurred around 208 m.y.a., creating the environment that early dinosaurs exploited to become the Earth’s dominant animals (this impact produced the changes that mark the junction between the Triassic and Jurassic periods). The second collision happened around 65 m.y.a., and ended the dinosaurs’ supremacy. Other extinctions occurred around 438 m.y.a., 367 m.y.a., and 245 m.y.a. Each of these cataclysms resulted in the demise of more than fifty percent of the prevailing marine species, and an equal or greater percentage of the existing land species.&lt;ref&gt;Sediments formed around 245 m.y.a. have recently been found to hold carbon “buckyballs” that contain trapped helium and argon gases which are present in a ratio similar to that found in carbon-based meteorites. This adds support to the theory that the effects of a sizable comet or asteroid impact caused the massive extinction that wiped out over 90% of all extant species (and marks the Permian-Triassic Boundary). This extinction eliminated much competition and provided the niches that some lizards exploited during the following twenty million years as they slowly evolved into the earliest forms of dinosaurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other environmental calamities may have occurred several times between 750 and 570 m.y.a. An analysis of carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratios in sedimentary layers formed in ancient oceans shows that life came to a standstill four times during that period (see the August 28, 1998 edition of Science). It is postulated that the Earth was entirely covered with ice during these times, resembling a planetary snowball. What subsequently happened may have been as follows. Life survived (as multicellular algae and seaweeds) in the small pockets that formed where volcanoes and hot springs maintained some warmth. Meanwhile, the same volcanoes continuously pumped carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and a greenhouse environment slowly developed. After some tens of millions of years (during which time life in the warm pockets diversified as it variously adapted to each pocket’s particular environment), the greenhouse gases triggered periods of planetary warming. About 565 m.y.a. most of the ice covering the Earth melted, and the pockets opened up. The life forms released from different zones would then have been able to cross-fertilize, and in the warm, nutritionally rich environment, with minimal competition, evolution would have run rampant. This could have spawned the broad diversity of ancestral multicellular plants and animals that we find in fossil form from this period, and begun the Cambrian Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of growth from tree rings as well as ice core samples show that large calamities, due to one cause or another, have also occurred relatively recently. The most prominent events happened around 3200, 2300, 1628, and 1159 BCE; the most recent took place in 535 CE.

Catastrophes rapidly and radically transform the planet’s various environments, and life forms that do not adapt (i.e., evolve) do not survive. (And, as a corollary, it must be emphasized that if life does not continue to evolve it will not continue to survive, for it is certain that changes will occur to life’s environment in the future just as often as they have in the past. Moreover, it is worth noting that the environment currently changing the most rapidly is not the Earth’s biosphere, it is our human mental environment—a change  brought about by the mix of facts, ideas, opinions, fantasies, beliefs, etc., that worms its way into our thoughts every day. To survive, we must discover how to adapt to the changes occurring there.)

Fossil records show gross evolutionary changes in ''Homo’s'' body structures that took thousands of years to develop. Detecting subtle changes necessitates making fine measurements, and we currently lack the detailed records covering several generations that would unequivocally demonstrate human evolution in action. Doubtless, as computer record-keeping increases in scope and depth (particularly if DNA profiles are to be stored), we will soon have plenty of evidence to show that, like all else that lives, humans evolve, and evolve continuously.

Humans have always acted to minimize the effects of events that may influence their evolution. We store food and survive most food shortages; if we did not do this, the average body mass and size of ''H. sapiens'' would drift downwards. We capitalize on niches and specialize in occupations; if we did not do this, our numbers would decrease because there would be too many competing within each energy niche (read money, thus food, for energy) and fewer would survive. We stress universal literacy and education; if we did not do this, the total number of energy niches would decline over time. Together, forces such as these select for particular skills: musical, mathematical, artistic, and so on. In effect, ever since we have had the ability, we have acted in a manner that influences the way we evolve. Genetic engineering is about to vastly extend this ability.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is not difficult to estimate the probability that life has developed on other planets in the universe. All we need do is calculate the total number of stars, the number of these that may support habitable planets, and the likelihood that any of these planets would support life.&lt;ref&gt;This type of formulation was first proposed in 1961 by Frank Drake, currently Chairman Emeritus of the SETI Institute. (SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is a project that has been running for over 25 years at University of California-Berkeley using radio telescopes.) Drake wished to guesstimate the possibility of being able to contact extra-terrestrial life, and made a calculation somewhat like the following:&lt;br /&gt;
:Number of technical civilizations in the Milky Way = &lt;br/&gt;
::''Number of stars in the Milky Way (say 2x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) x''&lt;br/&gt;
::''Fraction of stars with planetary systems (say ½) x''&lt;br/&gt;
::''Number of planets per star (say 1) x''&lt;br/&gt;
::''Number of planets favourable to life (say 1/10) x''&lt;br/&gt;
::''Fraction eventually developing life (say 1/10) x''&lt;br/&gt;
::''Fraction with intelligent life (say 1/100) x''&lt;br/&gt;
::''Fraction at our technical stage of development (say 1/10,000)''.&lt;br/&gt;
See [[w:Drake equation|]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Multiplying these together we find that the number of planets with life at an “electronically-developed” stage in our galaxy could be around a thousand. Of course, the number likely to be at our stage of development, when communications over distances are carried out by AM, FM, or digitally encoded electro-magnetic waves, the kind of signals SETI’s instruments have been looking for, is quite critical. More advanced beings may well be using a different form of communication—piped-optical for example, or some other method that our current instruments would not detect. SETI has also been conducting optical searches (without success) and has just begun looking for laser beacons (which, if narrowly focused, would only be detected if we happened to pass through their beam).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In our calculation, since we are only estimating the possibility that life exists elsewhere, we are not bothered about its intelligence or stage of development so can ignore the reduction these fractions would contribute. Moreover, we are discussing life’s presence in the entire universe, not just our own galaxy.&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the number of stars in our universe. It is estimated that our Milky Way galaxy contains between two and three hundred billion stars (2-3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;), and that there are about one hundred billion galaxies (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) in the visible universe. If the average number of stars in other galaxies is similar to ours, then there are 2-3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars all told. Using the smaller number we have 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars to start with.

Second, there are many inhospitable zones within all galaxies (the planets of stars too close to the centre of a galaxy or to radiating black holes, for instance, are being sterilized by microwaves&lt;ref&gt;See Guillermo Gonzalez, Donald Brownlee and Peter D. Ward, “Refuges for Life in a Hostile Universe,” ''Scientific American'', October 2001, 60-67.&lt;/ref&gt;) and stars in these regions are unlikely to support life-bearing planets, at least, not life as we think of it.&lt;ref&gt;Common understanding holds that, to be considered living, an entity must meet at least four criteria: consume energy, expel wastes, respond to its environment, and reproduce. But see [[../../Life And Exploiting/Life's Beginning|Life's Beginning]] for an alternative definition.&lt;/ref&gt; Let’s guess that only one tenth of each galaxy’s stars are clear of these areas, giving us 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; stars in hospitable zones of the universe.

Third, using observations noted in [[../../The Universe/The Life Of A Typical Star|The Life Of A Typical Star]], we can guesstimate that some fifty percent of all stars possess planetary systems, so about 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; (or 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;) stars are predicted to have orbiting planets.

Fourth, many exoplanets likely do not possess the conditions we consider necessary to support life (water, appropriate temperature ranges, appropriate elements and minerals, energy sources such as sunlight or planetary heat, etc.). A reasonable guess might be that of those possessing planetary systems, only one star in ten will hold a planet that is habitable. This gives us 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; stars or 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; habitable planets.

Fifth, we do not know if life will always arise on habitable planets.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on this topic see “Livable Planets: Calculations raise the odds for finding life in the cosmos,” by Corey S. Powell in ''Scientific American'', February 1993, 18-20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Earth may already possess a few samples of life from elsewhere in the cosmos, lying undiscovered on our ocean floors or hidden in rocks or crannies on our continents. Entities resembling a string of cells (and possibly being primitive life forms) have been discovered on a meteorite originating from Europa (one of Jupiter’s moons). However the sample is not large enough to conclude whether any of the entities were once living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Analyses of magnetic-field intensities along with various other measurements taken by satellites, indicate that Ganymede, Europa and Callisto (all moons of Jupiter) possess water. Some form of life may exist or have existed within this water, but this possibility remains to be explored. Probes, specifically equipped to test for water, may be sent to Europa within the next decade. Future Mars landers will be exploring areas where frozen reservoirs of water have been discovered, specifically looking for the presence of life. However, within our solar system, only our planet provides easy living; conditions on the other planets and moons are such that any life that might be found is bound to be primitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Astronomers occasionally search for distant signs of life using satellites and telescopes principally designed for other purposes. This will change in 2007, provided NASA’s scheduled Kepler Mission satellite launches successfully. This mission will carry telescopes designed to locate and check the atmospheres of exoplanets for the presence of ozone. Ozone is a gas formed from free oxygen, and free oxygen can only be produced in lasting quantities by life. This is because methane, produced by bacterial decomposition of organic matter, constantly removes free oxygen by combining with it to form other compounds. If both methane and oxygen are found in exoplanet atmospheres, then life is almost certain to be producing a continuous supply of the oxygen.)&lt;/ref&gt; If, as is turning out to be likely, the molecules from which life originates can form in space-ice, then probably all of the universe’s planets will have been inoculated by now. How much of this material then goes on to create life can only be a guess. Presumably, if the right conditions exist, eventually all will; but, to err on the conservative side, let us say that only one in a hundred habitable planets becomes a host to life.&lt;ref&gt;This guess may be far too cautious. For reasons to be outlined in the next chapter, it is highly likely that life will always arise when circumstances permit (see also de Duve, Vital Dust, xv and 20).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus about 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (1,000,000,000,000,000,000 or one quintillion) life-bearing planets possibly exist in the visible universe. Of these, about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, or ten million, could be in our own galaxy.

As we learn more about the nature of life and our universe, we will undoubtedly revise our estimates of the number of planets that could be home to living entities. The number may decrease or increase, even significantly, but it is very unlikely that the number will turn out to be one. Statistically, therefore, it is highly improbable that our planet is the only one to bear life; the universe contains an incredibly large number of stars, and the conditions and ingredients required to start and support life probably exist in many, many millions of places. Furthermore, these places may include intergalactic space, within gases where life’s precursors may first have formed, then evolved, to create living entities that waft through the heavens in forms vastly different from ones we might recognize.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The contention that life exists elsewhere holds a mystery. If ten million planets in our galaxy alone are likely to support life, why have we not heard from any of it by now? It has been estimated that about a thousand of these planets would be supporting life that has evolved to the state of communicating by radio transmissions. Why has the SETI Institute (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) not yet detected intelligence-bearing signals?

Moreover, why have we not found unquestionable evidence&lt;ref&gt;The pyramids, Nazca lines, Stonehenge, crop circles and other occurrences have all been suggested as being possible evidence of alien visitation. However, all can be more credibly explained as being due to human effort.&lt;/ref&gt; that we have been visited by aliens, or by one of their devices? We have already sent probes far beyond our own solar system, and within a decade or two will likely send similar instruments to exoplanets orbiting neighbouring stars. Indeed, in less than a couple of generations we may be visiting these planets ourselves. (Current technology necessitates journeys limited to a dozen years or so, but ion-accelerated drives already in use promise an ability to travel great distances in that amount of time.) This being so, we will inevitably attempt to colonize any habitable exoplanets we find, and, from those bases, we will certainly move onwards and outwards. All intelligent life, needing to replenish the resources it consumes throughout its industrial development on its home planet, will want to do the same. A few plausible assumptions and a couple of calculations suggest that any such pioneering life form will have colonized the whole of its own galaxy within a period of five to fifty million years.

This may seem a long time relative to our life span, but it is minuscule in evolutionary terms (we have to go back farther than that to find living dinosaurs). And it is an almost infinitesimal period on the galactic time scale. Life on other planets could well have begun a billion or more years before it arose on ours. Why, then, have we not been colonized by any of the intelligent civilizations that should have been able to do so in the past hundreds of million years? Or, why have we not at least been visited by some form of von Neumann probe (see [[../../The Universe/The Expanding Universe#cite_note-6|The Expanding Universe, footnote 7]] for a little more information about von Neumann probes) during that time?

Crawford&lt;ref&gt;Ian Crawford, “Where are they?” ''Scientific American'', July 2000, 38-43.&lt;br/&gt;
See also Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee, ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe'' (New York: Copernicus, 2000).&lt;br/&gt;
For the opposite view, read Amir D. Aczel, ''Probability 1: Why there must be Intelligent Life in the Universe'' (New York: Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the answer to this puzzle (called the “Fermi Paradox”) could be that, although the formation and evolution of life may indeed be universal, its subsequent development into intelligent life forms may be rare. An alternative explanation could be that von Neumann probes have already visited, or even now be present. If they were small enough—developed by aliens using nanotechnology, perhaps—we would not have noticed them.

However, the explanation may be even simpler. Perhaps life forms intelligent enough to use von Neumann probes, or to travel and colonize hospitable planets, avoid planets whose “intelligent” inhabitants are constantly at war among themselves. Landing would certainly lead to a transfer of technology, and would eventually equalize abilities of the two life forms. Far easier for them to wait to see if we mature to a stage where we no longer make war; seeking contact before then only invites trouble and is simply not what an intelligent being would do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The major points in this chapter may be summarized as follows.

# We don’t know where life started, but we do know how it developed once it took root on this planet.
# Evolution, meaning change over time, is a fact. Natural Selection is a theory, and it very satisfactorily explains why evolution occurs.&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent review of life’s evolution through its four billion years of development, read ''Vital Dust'' (op. cit.) by Christian de Duve, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist. de Duve traces life’s four billion years of development on this planet from its chemical beginnings, through its RNA and DNA encodings, to its current status. His text contributes the kind of understanding that should be possessed by all who make decisions that bear upon life’s future.&lt;/ref&gt;
# There is a high probability that life exists wherever conditions permit, in likely countless billions of habitats throughout the universe.
# Life’s history parallels that of the universe in its change from simple to complex, because the same laws of physics govern the behaviour of both.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, the second law of thermodynamics. This law states that the total amount of disorder (also known as entropy or complexity) in a closed system (for example, the universe) can never decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To understand entropy, it may help to consider a handful of black marbles shaken into a box containing a handful of white ones. The two mix, and the marbles become disordered, their arrangement “complex.” It takes energy to separate the black and white marbles and return this “system” to “simplicity.” Thus, the disorder of a complex system can be decreased but energy is required, and this energy must come from some larger system. In the example just given, the energy comes from the food eaten by the person separating the marbles. In turn, the energy in the food came from an even larger system—our sun (via photosynthesis), whose energy in turn came from that introduced at the universe’s beginning (through the singularity that opened into the Big Bang).&lt;br/&gt;
But, the universe is the largest system we know. It is a closed system (as far as we can tell) and energy cannot be taken from “outside” (if such a place exists). So the universe becomes more and more disordered each second as innumerable events occur everywhere. It becomes more complex, its entropy is ever increasing, and it must forever continue to become so, because there is nowhere (again, as far as we know) from which can be taken the energy needed to order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Subsystems within the universe can be made more ordered because they are open systems, and energy can therefore be taken from elsewhere in the universe’s stock. Life does this organizing, for example when it changes complex food molecules into simpler ones before recombining them in ways useful to itself. Many other processes also reduce entropy, for example when sunlight or lightning break water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen molecules. But the net result of any kind of organizing is always an increase in the universe’s complexity, because the energy exchanges that are involved all release electromagnetic radiation (usually in the form of heat—think how hot a person would become were they to quickly sort ten thousand marbles, for instance). This energy release eventually heats (i.e., agitates) atoms somewhere, and adds disorder. In other words, with each exchange the total quality of the energy is irreversibly degraded, increasing the total complexity of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;
Life started simple and is becoming more and more complex through the addition of variations and adaptations to what existed earlier. In this manner, its evolution parallels that of the universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organization of lymphoma pages==
Since lymphoma is a complex topic with several subtypes, I thought it would be difficult to discuss all subtypes in a single section on, say, &quot;high grade lymphomas.&quot;  Also, it would be redundant to include background information and treatment information for each of the subtypes on their own pages since treatment for many lymphoma types is essentiall the same.  

I decided to split up the pages as follows: an &quot;overview&quot; section that is split up into different pages for each unique subtype.  These overview pages would discuss epidemiology, etiology, survival, prognostic factors, etc.

There would also be a &quot;treatment&quot; section that discusses lymphoma treatment.  I think it makes most sense to divide this up into treatment for high grade and low grade lymphomas, since in practice, that's how treatment is decided.  &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 20:10, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

:In general I agree, but I think for some of the more specific/rare subtypes, it makes sense to keep all the disease-specific treatment info on the disease-specific page (e.g. MALT) [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 05:00, 18 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

White exchanges on d5, and black almost always responds with cxd5. This forms opposite-wing majorities. This usually will lead into a Panov-Botvinnik Attack, although independent lines can arise after 4.Bd3.

=Caro-Kann Defence - Advance Variation=
{{ChessStub}}

The advance variation was widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the [[Opening_theory_in_chess/1._e4/1...c6/2._d4/2...d5/3._e5/3...Bf5/4._Bd3|strategic demolition]] that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of José Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament:

Black almost always plays 3...Bf5 to free the light-squared bishop outside the pawn chain, but, when trying to avoid the weight of theory associated with this line, can play 3...c5.

The Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4) favored by Latvian Grandmaster Alexei Shirov or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3 popularized by English Grandmaster Nigel Short.

The 3...c5 variation is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1961 match vs. Mikhail Tal (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik – two draws and a loss). In comparison to the French defense, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on ...e6. However, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central bind with 4. dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.

{{Wikipedia|Cygwin}}

== Before experiencing X ==
Cygwin/X is installed by selecting the necessary packages from the X11 category with the standard Cygwin installer. Users unsure of what is needed should install all of the X11 components.

== Accessing X of your Local Cygwin ==
You can run the X server and the Window Manager locally and get the X Window GUI environment.

There are various ways you can do this. They are as follows:

=== MultiWindow Mode ===
In the multiwindow mode, there is an internal window manager that creates a Windows window to display the X application on the Windows desktop.

=== X ===
X is a soft-link (shortcut from Windows standpoint) to /usr/X11R6/bin/XWin.

# Start Cygwin
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;X -multiwindow &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Cygwin/X window comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

=== startxwin.bat ===
# Run startxwin.bat from &lt;tt&gt;usr\X11R6\bin\&lt;/tt&gt; folder where your Cygwin is installed. This can be done by double clicking on the batch file. It will bring up an xterm window. If you don't want to go through the hassle of finding this file, you can simply run the startxwin-multiwindow.bat file which should be present on your desktop. Both the scripts are very similar.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the xterm window. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

=== startxwin.sh ===
# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;startxwin.sh &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. It'll bring up an xterm window.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the xterm window. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

=== startx ===
# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;startx &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. It'll bring up an xterm window.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the xterm window. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

== External Local Window Manager ==
If you want the complete desktop environment, you will have to run a window manager or Linux desktop to send the GUI to your X server. This section is a discussion on this topic.

=== X ===
X is a soft-link (shortcut from Windows standpoint) to /usr/X11R6/bin/XWin.

# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;X &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Cygwin/X window comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;wmaker &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;
# Check your Cygwin/X window. You have got the desktop. :-)

== Accessing X of a Remote Box ==
In the following discussion the following IP addresses and user name have been assumed:-
* remote_box - IP Address or domain name of remote box
* my_system - IP Address or domain name of your Windows system
* user_name - A valid account in the remote box

== X11 Forwarding ==
For some of the methods described in this section, X Forwarding should be enabled in the remote box. Whether this is enabled or not can be found out from the file, &lt;tt&gt;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&lt;/tt&gt; of the remote box.

If there is a line &lt;tt&gt;X11Forwarding yes&lt;/tt&gt;, it means X11 Forwarding is enabled and you can go ahead with the steps below.

If it is, &lt;tt&gt;X11Forwarding no&lt;/tt&gt;, X11 Forwarding is disabled. You can edit it to enable it. Of course this can be done by the &quot;root&quot; only. If you need X11 Forwarding enabled and you are not the &quot;root&quot; of the box, you'll have to talk to its admin.

== MultiWindow Mode ==
In the multiwindow mode, there is an internal window manager that creates a Windows window to display the X application on your Windows desktop.

=== X ===
X is a soft-link (shortcut from Windows standpoint) to /usr/X11R6/bin/XWin directory.

# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;X -multiwindow &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Cygwin/X window comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0&lt;/tt&gt;
# Log in to the remote box with the command, &lt;tt&gt;ssh -X user_name@remote_box&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application on the remote box. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

For the above method to work, [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] should be enabled in the remote box.

=== startxwin.bat ===
# Run startxwin.bat from &lt;tt&gt;usr\X11R6\bin\&lt;/tt&gt; folder where your Cygwin is installed. This can be done by double clicking on the batch file. It'll bring up an xterm window. If you don't want to go through the hassle of finding this file, you can simply run the startxwin-multiwindow.bat file which should be present on your desktop. Both the scripts are exactly similar.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xhost remote_box&lt;/tt&gt; to provide remote box access to the X server running on your Cygwin. Alternatively you can execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xhost +&lt;/tt&gt; to disable access control completely, so that any client can connect to your X server.
# Log in to the remote box with the command, &lt;tt&gt;ssh -X user_name@remote_box&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=my_system:0.0&lt;/tt&gt; on the remote box.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the xterm window. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application on the remote box. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

If [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] is enabled in the remote box, you can omit step 2 and step 4.

=== startxwin.sh ===
# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;startxwin.sh &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. It'll bring up an xterm window.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xhost remote_box&lt;/tt&gt; to provide remote box access to the X server running on your Cygwin. Alternatively you can execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xhost +&lt;/tt&gt; to disable access control completely, so that any client can connect to your X server.
# Log in to the remote box with the command, &lt;tt&gt;ssh -X user_name@remote_box&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=my_system:0.0&lt;/tt&gt; on the remote box.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the xterm window. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application on the remote box. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

If [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] is enabled in the remote box, you can omit step 3 and step 4.

=== startx ===
# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;startx &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. It'll bring up an xterm window.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xhost remote_box&lt;/tt&gt; to provide remote box access to the X server running on your Cygwin. Alternatively you can execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xhost +&lt;/tt&gt; to disable access control completely, so that any client can connect to your X server.
# Log in to the remote box with the command, &lt;tt&gt;ssh -X user_name@remote_box&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=my_system:0.0&lt;/tt&gt; on the remote box.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; in the xterm window. (xclock comes up).

Now you can run any X application on the remote box. They open up in separate windows individually with your windows title-bar, caption buttons and border. You don't get the desktop environment in this case.

If [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] is enabled in the remote box, you can omit step 3 and step 4.

=== [[PuTTY]] ===
# Open PuTTY
# From the Category tree, select &quot;Session&quot; and enter the host details.
# From the Category tree, select &quot;Connection &gt; SSH &gt; X11&quot; and check the &quot;Enable X11 Forwarding&quot; checkbox.
# Click &quot;Open&quot; and login.
# Run an X Server on your Windows machine. There are various ways to do it.
## Open Cygwin and run &lt;tt&gt;X -multiwindow &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;.
## Run &lt;tt&gt;startxwin.bat&lt;/tt&gt; from Windows or open Cygwin and run &lt;tt&gt;startx&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;startxwin.sh&lt;/tt&gt;. An extra xterm opens which might be a pain since you don't need it. (The previous two steps save you from that).
# Get back to your PuTTY window and execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;xclock &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; (xclock comes up).
# Check your Cygwin/X window. (You have got the desktop :-))

For this method to work [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] should be enabled in the remote box and you should be logging into the remote box using the SSH protocol.

If you want to save yourself from the first four steps, simply add the path of the PuTTY directory to the Windows PATH variable or you can simply put PuTTY.exe in the Windows directory. Henceforth, you can simply execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;putty -X user_name@remote_host&lt;/tt&gt; from anywhere and then proceed with step 5.

== External Remote Window Manager ==
If you want the complete desktop environment of a remote box, you will have to run a window manager or Linux desktop on the remote box and forward the X output to the X server of your Windows PC so that you can see the GUI on your X server. This section is a discussion on how this can be done.

=== X ===
X is a soft-link (shortcut from Windows standpoint) to /usr/X11R6/bin/XWin directory.

# Start Cygwin (The Bash shell comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;X &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. (Cygwin/X window comes up)
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0&lt;/tt&gt;
# Log in to the remote box with the command, &lt;tt&gt;ssh -X user_name@remote_box&lt;/tt&gt;
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;wmaker &amp;&lt;/tt&gt; on the box.
# Check your Cygwin/X window. You have got the desktop of the remote box. :-)

For the above method to work, [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] should be enabled in the remote box.

=== PuTTY ===
# Open PuTTY
# From the Category tree, select &quot;Session&quot; and enter the host details.
# From the Category tree, select &quot;Connection &gt; SSH &gt; X11&quot; and check the &quot;Enable X11 Forwarding&quot; checkbox
# Click &quot;Open&quot; and login.
# Execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;X &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, to run the Cygwin X server on your Windows system.
# Get back to your PuTTY window and run &lt;tt&gt;wmaker &amp;&lt;/tt&gt;. 
# Check your Cygwin/X window. (You have got the desktop :-))

For this method to work [[#X11 Forwarding|X11 Forwarding]] should be enabled in the remote box and you should be logging into the remote box using the SSH protocol.

If you want to save yourself from the first four steps, simply add the path of the PuTTY folder to the Windows PATH variable for once and ever. Henceforth, you can simply execute the command, &lt;tt&gt;putty -X user_name@remote_host&lt;/tt&gt; from anywhere and then proceed with step 5.

== Recipe: Run an X application (on a remote UNIX machine) with a local Windows X Server ==

- Install Cygwin including the X11 client and Secure Shell SSH.

- Start Cygwin Bash Shell by clicking on the Cygwin icon.

- Start the X Server (This opens another Bash Shell in an X window.
  $ /usr/X11R6/bin/startx
- Allow the remote computer to X Client into your local computer by adding the remoter server to the access control list.
  $ xhost +''RemoteServerName or IP Address''
- Use ssh to access the remoter computer. You will be prompted for a UserID and Password.
  $ ssh -X +''RemoteServerName or IP Address''
- While on the remote computer execute the program you want in background mode.
  $ +''ProgramYouWant &amp;''
== Cygwin Tips ==

* Install [[Cygwin]] to the default directory, ''C:\cygwin\'' for consistency. You can also make the path longer, for instance to keep multiple versions of Cygwin.
* When installing, check ''cygrunsrv'' to allow for running ''sshd'' as a Windows service
* To use '''rxvt''' as the preferred console, create a Windows shortcut with the '''Target''' set to ''C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe --loginShell -sr'' and '''Start in''' set to ''C:\cygwin\bin''.
* To enlarge the console window and add a title, add ''-geometry &quot;80x50&quot; -title Cygwin'' to the '''Target'''.
* To start an SSH session, add ''-e ssh user@machine.name.com'' to the '''Target'''.
* To change the default home directory to ''My Documents'' on NT-based Windows (NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista), create an environment variable called '''HOME''' with value of ''C:\DOCUME~1\USERNAME\MYDOCU~1'' (where ''USERNAME'' is your Windows login username).
* Create an environment variable called '''SHELL''' with value of ''/bin/bash''.
* Make sure ''c:\cygwin\bin;'' is added to the '''Path''' environment variable.
* To mount prefix from ''/cygdrive'' to ''/'' type this command once, ''mount -s --change-cygdrive-prefix /''
* Or keep cygdrive as is and create mounts (e.g. ''mount -u C: /C'') for every drive.
* [[Emacs]] and [[vi]] are the most popular editors but [[Nano (text editor)|Nano]] is the easiest to use.
* Create a file called ''.bash_profile'' in the '''HOME''' directory containing the following lines:
** alias dir='ls -lav --color=auto'
** EDITOR=nano; export EDITOR
** VISUAL=nano; export VISUAL
* To use the ''clear'' command install the ncurses package (in the ''lib'' category)

==Goal==
I am using a basic scene that I quickly set up before I started to create the carpet material. It shows a monkey (suzanne), a plane, camera, 3 area lamps and 1 spot lamp. &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Basic-scene.jpg|240px|The basic scene setup]]

The purpose of this tutorial, is to highlight the power of blenders built in shaders and procedural textures to create a carpet material to use in your scenes.

 '''NOTE:'''''  For those of you needing help getting a similar scene to the one above, here are some axis positions,etc. to help out:
 '''(Spot-Lamp)'''-'''X'''=1.62,'''Y'''=0.86,'''Z'''=6.74;'''rotation'''-'''X'''=37.26,'''Y'''=3.16,'''Z'''=181.34;
 '''(Area-Lamp-1)X'''=4,'''Y'''=3.27,'''Z'''=4.12;'''rotation'''-'''X'''=54.67,'''Y'''=-18.59,'''Z'''=-109.47;
 '''(Area-Lamp-2)X'''=-2.07,'''Y'''=-2.08,'''Z'''=4.85;'''rotation'''-'''X'''=29.37,'''Y'''=-28.98,'''Z'''=355;
 '''(Area-Lamp-3)X'''=0.315,'''Y'''=-2.89,'''Z'''=4.29;'''rotation'''-'''X'''=49.23,'''Y'''=-10.63,'''Z'''=6.68;
 '''(Monkey)X'''=0.05,'''Y'''=0,'''Z'''=0.42;'''rotation'''-'''X'''=58.61,'''Y'''=-16.07,Z=23.245;'''DIM'''(''dimensions'')'''X'''=2.734,'''Y'''=1.969,'''Z'''=1.703;
 '''(Plane)x'''=0,'''y'''=0,'''z'''=0;'''(no rotation)''';'''Dimensions''': '''X&amp;Y'''=14.30,'''z'''=0.
Alternatively, you could also download [http://www.mediafire.com/file/wwkzd9be907681g/basic-scene.blend a pre-made file] in case that you're in a hurry.

'''Noob Note:''' Try adjusting each of the area lamps Dist(ance) value.

'''Noob Question:''' How does the above coordinates help me at all? I haven't found anything that tells me were in 3D space object actually is or the objects dimensions little alone control them. Nothing in the Tutorial up to now even gives a clue to this.

'''Noob Answer:''' Hit 'N' to bring up the Transform Properties window and enter the values there.

==The Basic Material and Shader Settings==
For the basic material for the carpet set the color settings of your material as follows - &lt;br&gt; 
Col (R 0.714) (G 0.134) (B 0.134) Dark Red &lt;br&gt; 
Spe (R 0.590) (G 0.210) (B 0.084) Reddish Brown &lt;br&gt;
Mir (R 1.000) (G 1.000) (B 1.000) White &lt;br&gt;

Change the specular shader to ('phong') and leave the default lambert diffuse shader as it is. Change the ('spec') to [0.13] and the ('hard') to [12]. Lastly click the ('Full Osa') button to enable it. If you render now you will notice that the plane looks like an ugly pastel color (if not, you have a different lighting setup to mine and the shader will not look the same as the images in this tutorial.) Don't worry about this ugly looking plane it will soon be a beautiful carpet. &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Step1-scr.jpg|800px|Shader Screen-shot]] &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Step1-base-shader.jpg|240px|Base Shader]]

==Cloud Texture 1==

Press 'F6' on the keyboard to bring up the texture panel. Click the bottommost of the long boxes to create a texture in the bottom channel. Create a new texture and rename it something like 'Red Clouds 1'. From the ('Texture Type') pull down select clouds. In the 'Clouds' settings panel change ('NoiseSize') to [0.210] and ('NoiseDepth') to [4]. &lt;br&gt;

Now select the Colors tab which will bring up the ColorBand for the texture. Press the orange ('Add') button to add a cursor on the colourband. Next make sure the 'Cur : 0' is showing next to the add button and change the colours as follows - (R 0.770, G 0.168, 0.168). Now click on right side of the 'Cur : 0' so it shows 'Cur : 1'. Change 'Pos' to 0.6. Set Alpha to 1 and change the colour to (R 0.732 G 0.243 B 0.243). &lt;br&gt;


[[Image:Texture1-tex-panel.jpg|608px|Texture 1 texture panel Screenshot]] &lt;br&gt;

Now go back into the material settings and change the settings in the Map To tab as follows. Click ('Spec') twice so the text becomes yellow do the same for ('Hard'). Now select 'Subtract' for the texture blending mode. Change ('Col') to [0.188].&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture1-mat-panel.jpg|408px|Texture 1 materials panel Screenshot]] &lt;br&gt;

At this stage if you render you might find it hard to notice the difference, it is apparent only where there is low light levels on the plane, don't worry about this at the moment. It means if you render with Ambiant Occlusion you get a nice carpet effect of slightly varying colour.

==Cloud Texture 2==

Go back to the texture panel and create another texture, call it 'Clouds' and put it in the channel above 'Red Clouds'. Change ('NoiseSize') to [0.054] and ('NoiseDepth') to 4. Select 'Improved Perlin' from the Noise Basis pull down. Finally change ('Nabla') to [0.031]. Do not change any more settings here.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture2-tex-panel.jpg|618px|Texture 2 texture panel Screenshot]] &lt;br&gt;

Now in the material panel, under the Map To tab change the following - Click ('Nor'). Click ('Spec') and ('Hard') twice so as they are yellow.  

[[Image:Texture2-mat-panel.jpg|412px|Texture 2 material panel Screenshot]]&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture2-render.jpg|240px|Render with the 2 textures so far]] &lt;br&gt;

As you can see the material is starting to look a bit better, only 2 more textures to go.

==The Final Cloud Texture==

Switch to the texture panel once again and create a new Clouds texture in the next channel up. Change ('NoiseSize') to [0.010] and ('NoiseDepth') to [6]. Now click on the 'Colors' tab and change the colour of the left cursor ('Cur : 0') to (R 0.713 G 0.262 B 0.223) and Alpha to 0. Switch to Cursor 1 ('Cur : 1') and its colour settings (R 1.000 G 0.363 B 0.000) and Alpha to 1. &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture3-tex-panel.jpg|618px|Texture 3 texture panel Screenshot]]&lt;br&gt;

Now in the materials panel under the 'Map To' tab Click ('Nor'). Click ('Spec') and ('Hard') twice so as they are yellow. Leave the blending mode as 'Mix'. Change ('Col') to [0.464] and ('Nor') to [1.00].

[[Image:Texture3-mat-panel.jpg|409px|Texture 3 materials panel Screenshot]]&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture3-render.jpg|240px|Render of the 3 textures so far]]&lt;br&gt;

==The Last Texture==

Finally, go to the textures panel one last time. Create a new Stucci texture in the next channel up. Change ('NoiseSize') to [0.006] and ('Turbulence') to [10.94]. Click on the 'Colors' tab. The first cursor 'Cur : 0' should be black with alpha 0. 'Cur : 1' should be red (R 1.000 G 0.000 B 0.000) with alpha 1.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture4-tex-panel.jpg|800px|Texture 4 textures panel]]&lt;br&gt;

Now go to the materials panel. Under the 'Map To' tab Click ('Nor'). Click ('Spec') and ('Hard') twice. Change the Blending type to 'Subtract'. Change ('Col') to [0.056] and ('Nor') to [0.50]. And that's it. When you render now, you should have a nice-looking carpet material. By tweaking with the colours you can create any colour of carpet. &lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Texture4-mat-panel.jpg|412px|Texture 4 material panel]]&lt;br&gt;

'''Subsurface modeling'''

Organic modeling is considered by some the most challenging. Non-organic can mostly be accomplished by extrusion and scaling. Organic modeling on the other hand involves mainly curves, as nature has a thing against straight lines. Because of this, organic modeling is usually done with subsurfaces. To subsurf a mesh, first select it and navigate to the 'Editing' tab. Then go to the modifiers stack and add a new Subsurf modifier.

[[File:BlenderAddSubsurf.jpg]]

In Blender 2.5 Alpha 0, Subsurf has been removed from the modifiers list. Instead hit Ctrl, followed by a number which will specify the subsurf level. For example &lt;b&gt;Ctrl-1&lt;/b&gt; adds a new Subsurf modifier of level 1. This also works in Blender 2.4. Increasing the level greatly increases the number of verts in your model, so make the level relative to the number of vertices in your original model (pre-subsurfed). Subsurf often works best in conjunction with smoothing, so be sure to set your object to smooth, again in the 'Editing' tab, or in 2.5 A0 under 'Object Tools', which you can bring up by hitting the &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; key in the 3D viewport.

[[File:BlenderSubsurfModifier.jpg]]

In this way you can create a smoother, higher-poly shape based on that of the original mesh. This is controlled by the vertices, edges and faces of the original.In order to control the rounding of your mesh you can use two methods: loopcuts, which is a very sloppy method as it adds more verts to your mesh, which serve very little purpose and can get in the way of modeling; and Edge Creasing. The latter can work extremely well in most circumstances. By default all edges are declared uncreased, and so allow complete rounding in subsurfing, by creasing the edges using &lt;b&gt;Shift-E&lt;/b&gt; you can far better control the amount of rounding on your mesh, and most importantly, without adding extra vertices. However, unfortunately Edge Creasing is not available in Blender 2.5 A0. Yet. And so loopcuts and extra verts are the only option.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Blender-DefaultSceneRender.jpg|Before
File:BlenderCubeSubsurfed.jpg|After
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now, start shaping your mesh into an organic shape. There are various tutorials for modeling bodies and faces, but it is often a good idea to use references. Only use quads - that is, shapes with four vertices. Triangles do not subsurface well, they create bad looking rough surfaces - avoid if at all possible. Also avoid Poles, which are vertices connected to anything other than 2 or 4 other vertices, as they create literal creasing in your subsurfed mesh, that is, sudden bunching up and pinching of faces.

To make the object shape properly, you will need good edgeloops and edgeflow. This means that all your vertices and/or faces line up in a continual line or curve around your model. It is possible to select edgeloops all in one, fantastic when you have to resort to them in controlling rounding, by holding down &lt;b&gt;Alt&lt;/b&gt; when selecting a vert. This really expands into topology, which is an advanced subject. I would recommend visiting http://www.subdivisionmodeling.com/forums, although it has just been closed down, which was a great place to start, however it still (at the time of revision) is active and well worth a look if you are struggling with modeling heads. It is best not to have too many vertices to avoid making the subsurfaced shape look rough - in other words, the original shape should be quite low-poly.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">On the AP Exam, there are a variety of questions you will encounter.
There is the multiple-choice question, familiar to many students, with choices A through D. There are also three essay questions in section II of the exam: the Document-Based Question, or DBQ; the Compare and Contrast Essay Question; and the Change-over-Time Essay. In Section I: Multiple Choice, there are 70 questions. You are given 55 minutes to complete Section I. Section II contains the free-response essay questions. You are given 130 minutes to complete the three essays.


== The Document-Based Question ==

The document-based question asks the student to answer a question about a group of people, civilization, period in world history, or other topic. The basis for your answer should consist of historical knowledge, and information obtained from the set of documents provided in the test booklet. In your essay, you are required, at a minimum, to give a thesis statement introducing your topic. It is recommended that you use all documents if possible in your analysis of the given topic, but you may exclude one document from your analysis. You should analyze bias you find in the given documents, and provide any missing documents that you may have found useful, but were not provided. To help plan your essay, you should group the documents into categories for use in your thesis statement. You should then relate each document to a manner consistent with the point being proven. Remember to cite the documents to make your essay easier to follow.

== The Change-Over-Time Essay ==

The COT asks you to compare the changes and continuities from one time period in a country or region to a later time. One format you can use to organize this essay is to start with your &quot;baseline&quot;, the beginning time period. Then describe the ending period. Finally describe the changes, or lack thereof, that took place between the starting and ending periods. After spending some time organizing your essay, you can go ahead and write it.

== The Compare and Contrast Essay ==

In this essay, you must compare/contrast two civilizations, groups of people, etc. You are often asked to choose two groups out of three that are provided. You should make relevent, direct comparisons in your essay, stemming from your thesis that describes the fundamental differences and/or similarities between the two groups being compared and contrasted.

== Tips for the Multiple-Choice ==

* Read the question, then all the answer choices before making a decision as to the answer.

* If you don't know the answer immediately, try to eliminate two or more answer choices that you know are wrong.

* Choose and bubble in an answer for every question in the test. If you are not sure about the answer to a question, make your best guess.

* Try marking questions you are unsure about in your exam booklet, and then going back to those marked questions once you have completed the multiple choice portion of the exam if you have extra time. Be sure to choose an answer to those questions as you pass them the first time around though, as you may risk forgetting to choose an answer if there is no time left, which will always impact you negatively.

== Tips for the Essays ==

* Don't waste time trying to correct spelling and grammar, attempt first to get your point across.

* Plan your essay before you begin writing, if possible. Even if you don't end up extensively planning your essay, keep your writing organized.

* Don't hurry trying to finish in order to add a conclusion to your essay. If you have time available, write the conclusion, if not, finish the body; it is more important.

* If you have extra time, read over your essay, but keep in mind you are writing the essay in pen. It is probably best to think your essay through the FIRST time, since editing afterwards is hard.

== AP Exam Scoring ==

You will receive your scores over the summer after your May exam. (Probably in mid-July) The scoring is on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Fours are desireable, as they are accepted for credit at  most colleges. Some colleges accept threes. Fives are often exceedingly hard to obtain. In some cases, it may require more than memorization (i.e. strong, fluid, and convincing writing on essays) of names, dates, and other history information to obtain a five.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is fun putting a camera on a path and animating it through your scene. Just plop an old ordinary beizer curve into your scene and make it whatever shape you would like. Then put a camera in your scene and parent, CTRL+PKEY, it to the path. Select Follow Path from the menu that pops up. Then view your animation, ALT+AKEY. To set the number of frames it takes to get across the path, go to Editing (F9) panel for the path and set the number of frames in the PathLen, uh, thing with the arrows on the side and number in the middle.

Well, that should get you started. What I did for one scene, and what I recommend for all scenes, is to put an empty on another path and set the camera to TrackTo it via CTRL+TKEY TrackTo Constraint. It is tricky to get right but the results are rewarding.

Good work. Notice however two items...&lt;br&gt;
You failed to introduce the reader (even ended up removing the some of the pertinent information) of what &quot;os.flush()&quot; is, it would be also interesting to provide a factual (or practical) example of the distinction. Even a note about possible issues and perhaps extend the notion on the debugging area.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:24, 19 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Palenque_11.jpg|thumb|Right|300px|Temple of the Cross at Palenque in Southern Mexico.]]The Maya were a Mesoamerican civilization. They had the most advanced writing system in the Americas prior to European contact. They used sophisticated mathematic systems and had complex and useful cyclical calendars. Spectacular art and monumental architecture were two other notable accomplishments of this civilization. 

==What country did they live in?==
The ancient Mayans lived in what is now known as southern Mexico and northern Central America including Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Yucatán Peninsula and El Salvador. Their descendants still live there today, and many of them speak the Mayan languages.

==What did their buildings look like?==
The Mayans were master architects, building pyramids and even entire cities, many of which are still standing today.

Mayan pyramids were made of stone. The stone was carved to create a stair-step design. On the top of each pyramid was a shrine dedicated to a particular deity. Rituals thought to influence the Gods were held in these shrines.

[[Image:Lightmatter chichen15.jpg|thumb|left|Pyramid of Kulkulkán at Chichén Itzá]]

Mayan cities grew around the pyramids. They consisted of plazas connected together by ''sacbeob'' (whiteway) causeways. There appears to have been little planning in their design; the topography of the region influenced the type of buildings constructed. For example, cities in the hills had tall towers, while cities built on limestone grew into large municipalities.

The largest plazas were at the heart of Mayan cities. They contained governmental and religious buildings, such as the royal acropolis, great pyramid temples, and occasionally ball-courts. Temples and observatories were always constructed so they followed the Mayan interpretation of the orbits of the stars. Outside of this center were less important temples and shrines. At the outskirts lay the homes of the common people.

===Building Materials===
The Mayans lacked many tools, such as metal tools, pulleys, and perhaps even the wheel. They did, however, have an abundance of materials. The most common material was limestone, taken from local quarries. Limestone was easy to work, and only hardened once removed from its bed. In addition, it could also be used as mortar or stucco. Common homes used wooden poles, adobe (a mixture of straw and sandy clay), and thatch; however, houses made of limestone have been found as well. In the city of Comalcalco, fired-clay bricks have been found as a substitute for stone. The Mayan's used clay, stone, limestone, thatched hay, wooden poles, and metal to make common day houses.

==What did they eat?==
The Mayans grew a wide variety of crops, including corn (maize), Amaranth, manioc, and sunflower seeds. These crops were grown in permanent raised fields, terraces, forest gardens, and managed fallows. There was also harvesting of wild crops. The Mayans ground cacao and mixed it with water to make the first chocolate.

==What did they wear?== 
[[Image:Yaxchilán lintel.jpg|thumb|200|right|The sculpture depicts a sacred ritual. The standing figure wears a headdress of Quetzal plumes. Mayan writing is seen at the top and right side.]]When the king appeared in public, he wore white robes and a gold crown on top of his head, decorated with Quetzal (a type of bird) plumes.

During wartime, the Mayans wore masks, while commanders wore robes made of silver and gold. Some Mayan clothes were made of deer skin. Usually women made the clothes.

== What did their writing look like? ==
The Mayans wrote using a series of glyphs (symbolic pictures), which were painted on ceramics, walls, or bark-paper codices (books), carved in wood or stone, or molded in stucco. Each glyph represented a word. Mayans wrote numbers vertically.

The Mayan script was used up until the arrival of the Spanish. Although many Mayan centers went into decline (or were completely abandoned) during or after this period, many Mayans still had the skill and knowledge of Mayan writing, and the early Spanish conquistadors knew of people who could still read and write the script. Unfortunately, the Spanish however believed that the Mayan books were evil so by the end of the 16th century, almost  all knowledge of the Mayan script was lost. 

Attempts to decipher the Mayan script came in the 19th century. Investigators were soon able to decipher the Mayan numbers and portions of texts related to astronomy and the Mayan calender. Most of the Mayan script has since been deciphered, but work still continues today. The Mayan calendar ends at the year of 2012, when they believed the world would end.

==What did they believe?==
The Mayans believed that time was cyclical, that is, it goes in circles. The Mayan shaman interpreted these cycles by looking at the number relations of all their calendars. If the interpretations of the shaman showed bad times ahead, human sacrifices would be performed to make the gods happy. They left behind a prophesy that the world would end on December 21, 2012 and bring about the fifth cycle of the world.

According to Mayan mythology, there were thirteen heavens and nine underworlds, with one god for each. Natural elements, stars and planets, numbers, crops, days of the calendar and periods of time all had their own gods.

The creation story of the Mayans is found in the ''Popol Vuh'' (&quot;Council Book&quot; or &quot;Book of the Community&quot;). According to the book, the gods Tepee and Tucuman's decided that, in order to preserve their legacy, they had to make a race of beings who could worship them. Earth, along with the animals, was created. Man was first made out of mud but then he fell apart. Other gods were summoned and man was next created of wood but had no soul. Finally, man was made out of maize by even more gods.

The Mayans worshiped Gods and Goddesses and they believed to make the Gods and Goddesses happy they had to make human sacrifices.

==What is left of them today?==
The ancient Mayans abandoned their large cities suddenly. To this day, no one is still certain why. However, the Mayan people never died out; their descendants still live in Mexico and Central America. The Mayan's legends and royal lineage is written in a book called Popul Vuh. The word 'hurricane' comes from the name of a fearsome Mayan god named Hurakan who is mentioned in this book. 

===People===
Mayans painted their bodies red, black, white, and blue and thought crossed eyes were cool. They tied objects to their babies' heads to give them crossed eyes. They tied boards to their babies' heads to flatten them too.

At the start of the 21st century, there were about 6 million Mayans living in the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Chiapas, and in the Central American countries of Belize, Guatemala, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.

The largest group of modern Mayans is found in the Yucatán region of Mexico. They speak both &quot;Yucatec Maya&quot; and Spanish, and are generally integrated into Mexican culture. More traditional Mayans are found in Guatemala. Many of them wear traditional clothes and practice traditional customs. The most traditional Mayans are a group called the Lacandon, who avoided contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the rain forests.

===Cities===
[[Image:Tikal temple jaguar.jpg|thumb|right| The city of Tikal]]

There are many Mayan buildings that were once part of cities still standing today. The most important ones are: Chichen Itza, Coba, Copán Kalakmul, Tikal, and Uxmal. These cites lay forgotten for centuries, until modern-day explorers rediscovered them. Archaeological surveys and excavations were conducted (and are still being conducted) on some of these sites, revealing more about Mayan culture. Today, some cities can be visited by tourists.

==Are some of them famous even today?==
There are indigenous people in Southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras who are descended from the Maya. One of the most famous of them is Rigoberta Menchu, a Quichè Indian. She wrote about the struggles of her people in her book I, Rigoberta Menchu. She received a Nobel Peace Prize.

*1 cup (240 g/2.4 dl) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nuts]] (½ inch / 1 cm [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] work well)

== Procedure ==
#Heat oven to 350°F/175°C.
#Melt chocolate and margarine in a double boiler, or (carefully) in a saucepan on low heat while stirring often.
#Remove from heat.
#Mix in the sugar, eggs and vanilla.
#Excluding the nuts, mix the dry ingredients with each other, and then into the wet mixture.
#Mix in the nuts.
#Spread into a 13-inch by 9-inch baking pan, or into two 8-inch by 8-inch baking pans.
#Bake for 30 minutes, or until brownies pull away from the sides of the pan.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* This works well with 3 Tablespoons of oil in place of the solid fat. When using [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], ⅓ cup should be about right.
* Unlike other brownie recipes which use [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] and fill one small pan, this recipe uses baking chocolate and fills two small pans or one large one.

'''Fudge brownies''' are dark, dense, [[Cookbook:Fudge|fudge]]-like brownies.  They contain more cocoa than cake-like brownies and as a result they are slightly more bitter and have a more &quot;dark chocolate&quot; taste.

==Ingredients==

* &amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.2 dl) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* &amp;frac34; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.8 dl) [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]]
* &amp;frac14; tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 1&amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (3 dl) [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 2 large, cold [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* &amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.2 dl) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 325 &amp;deg;F/160 &amp;deg;C.
# In a saucepan, melt butter over low heat.
# Slowly stir in sugar, making sure it is completely dissolved. Stir in cocoa. Remove from heat. Add vanilla.
# Stir in salt and mix until even.
# Whisk eggs together in a separate bowl, then add to the mixture and stir well.
# Add flour and stir until all of the flour is incorporated and the batter is an even color.  Stir well for at least another 50 strokes.
# Pour into a an 8&quot;&amp;times;8&quot; pan lined with aluminum foil, leaving plenty of overhang on both sides.
# Bake for about 26 minutes (the time varies depending on your pan type and your individual oven).

==Notes, tips and variations==

* For the best results, refrigerate the brownies until they are cooled completely.  Use the foil hanging over the edges as handles to remove the baked brownies from the pan (this requires some care as the brownies are not solid at this point).  Fold the foil over the top so that the brownies are covered top and bottom with foil, and then put the whole thing in the refrigerator until cooled (feel the bottom center if you aren't sure).  This prevents the edges from overcooking while allowing the center to finish baking and cool.  If you omit this step, you may end up with an undercooked center and/or overcooked edges.

* For the real chocolate lover, crumble about 50 grams (1&amp;frac34; ounces) of a dark chocolate bar (one with about 70% cocoa content) into the batter and stir it lightly right before pouring the mixture into the baking pan.  You may need to add a few minutes to the baking time.

* Cut a brownie in half lengthwise and eat it with ice cream in the middle like an ice cream sandwich.

* Instead of adding vanilla and/or nuts, try adding about 100 grams (4 oz) of fresh raspberries; their sharpness goes very well with the richness of the chocolate. Half fill the tin with batter, sprinkle the raspberries over the mixture, then pour on the rest.

These aren't actually idioms. By definition, an idiom is a phrase whose total meaning can't be deduced from the individual words. As in, &quot;finding your feet&quot; or &quot;a shot in the dark&quot;

----
The phrase &quot;おじいさんがすぐに帰らなければ&quot; has an ambiguity (thus may not be a good example). This can mean either of the followings:
#If Grandpa (who has been to somewhere outside now) doesn't return soon...
#If Grandpa (who is here now) won't get out of here immediately...
The writer of this page probably intended 1., I guess. In 2., the speaker seems unconfortable with his/her grandfather ;) - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 12:34:18, 2005-08-29 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definitions==

A '''sequence''' is simply a list of numbers in a particular order. We call these numbers the '''terms''' of the sequence. For instance, 2,4,6,8 are the first four terms in the sequence of even positive integers. When we take the sum of the terms in a sequence, we get a '''series'''. For example, 2+4+6+8+... is a series.

We denote the terms in a sequence by &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the term in question. For example, we have &lt;math&gt;T_1=2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_2=4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_3=6&lt;/math&gt;, and so on, in the sequence described above. 

A '''definition''' is a rule that tells us how to compute each term in a sequence. For example, a rule for the sequence above is &lt;math&gt;T_n=2n&lt;/math&gt;. A '''relation''' describes how each term is related to other terms. For instance, a relation for the above sequence is &lt;math&gt;T_{n+1}=T_{n}+2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Sigma (&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;) Notation==

As you might have suspected, describing a series with the help of some of its terms isn't always a good idea --- if too few terms are used, the series can be ambiguous to your reader; on the other hand, you risk insulting your reader by writing out too many terms! To express a series succinctly, we use the '''sigma &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt; notation''' instead.

In general, a series may be written as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=k_0}^{N} f(k)&lt;/math&gt;, which means &quot;sum of all terms beginning with &lt;math&gt;f(k_0)&lt;/math&gt; up to and including &lt;math&gt;f(N)&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Hence, 

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=k_0}^{N} f(k)=f(k_0)+f(k_0+1)+f(k_0+2)+\cdots+f(N)&lt;/math&gt;.

As an example, the series 2+4+6+8+... may be written as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}2k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Recognising Simple Progressions==

A '''progression''' is just another word for a '''sequence'''. In this module, you are expected to be well-acquainted with two very common types of progressions --- the '''arithmetic progression''' and the '''geometric progression'''.

Briefly, an arithmetic progression or '''AP''' is a sequence in which each successive term is the ''sum'' of the previous term and a fixed value. An example of an AP is 1,4,7,10,..., where the difference between successive terms is 3.

A geometric progression or '''GP''' is a sequence in which each successive term is the ''product'' of the previous term and a fixed value. An example of a GP is 2,4,8,16,32,..., where each term is twice the value of the previous term.

==Arithmetic Progression (AP)==

An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence that can be written in the following way: &lt;math&gt;a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a,d&lt;/math&gt; are constants. The first term &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; in the AP is denoted by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''common difference''' between subsequent terms is denoted by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the series 1,4,7,10,..., is an arithmetic progression with &lt;math&gt;a=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Rules===

The common difference &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by &lt;math&gt;d = T_n - T_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n=2,3,4,...&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th term is given by &lt;math&gt;T_n = a + (n-1)d&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; terms of an AP (with &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; as its first term and &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; as its last term) is given by &lt;math&gt;S_n = \frac{n}{2} (T_1 + T_n) = \frac{n}{2} (2a+(n-1)d)&lt;/math&gt;.

In fact, more generally, the sum of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; consecutive terms in an AP is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{number\,of\,terms}}{2}(\mathrm{first\,term} + \mathrm{last\,term}) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
''What is the sum of the even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 100?''

The given sequence can be expressed as an AP with &lt;math&gt;T_1 = a = 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d=2&lt;/math&gt;. We want the sum of the first 50 terms of the AP:

&lt;math&gt;S_{50}=\frac{50}{2}(2+100) = \frac{50}{2}\left(2(2)+(50-1)2\right) = 2550&lt;/math&gt;.

==Geometric Progression (GP)==

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence that can be written in the following way: &lt;math&gt;a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a,r&lt;/math&gt; are constants. The first term &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; in the GP is denoted by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''common ratio''' between subsequent terms is denoted by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

===Rules===

The common ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{T_n}{T_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n=2,3,4,...&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th term is given by &lt;math&gt;T_n = ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; terms of an GP is given by &lt;math&gt;S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof of this is given by: 

&lt;math&gt;S_n = a+ar+ar^2+\ldots+ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;rS_n = ar+ar^2+ar^3+\ldots+ar^n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_n-rS_n = a-ar^n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_n(1-r) = a(1-r^n)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

===Sum Of An Infinite Geometric Series===
We say that the geometric series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k= a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+ar^4+\ldots&lt;/math&gt; is '''convergent''' if the '''sum to infinity''' &lt;math&gt;S_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; approaches some limit. This occurs when &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;S_{\infty}=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}= \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof of this is given by:

&lt;math&gt;S_{\infty} = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;rS_{\infty} = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ...&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{\infty} - rS_{\infty} = a&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{\infty}(1-r) = a&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;

==Binomial expressions==

A binomial is a polynomial with two parts in the form &lt;math&gt;(a+b)&lt;/math&gt;, such as &lt;math&gt;(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;. When a binomial is raised to a power, you could simplify it by multiplying out the brackets several times. The expanded polynomial is called a '''binomial expansion''', and all binomial expansions follow a pattern that can be used to expand binomials quicker than multiplying out several brackets. For now, we will only look at binomial expressions which are raised to positive integers.

===Expansions of &lt;math&gt;(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;===

Here are the expansions of &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt; raised to different powers.

{|
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;(x+1)^1 =&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1x + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;(x+1)^2 =&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1x^2 + 2x + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;(x+1)^3 =&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;(x+1)^4 =&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|- align=&quot;left&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;(x+1)^5 =&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; | &lt;math&gt;1x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If you look at the coefficient of each term, you may notice a pattern. These numbers are called '''binomial coefficients''' and are found by adding the two numbers above it.

===Pascal's triangle===

Binomial coefficients are more commonly known as '''Pascal's triangle''', named after [[wikipedia:Blaise_Pascal|Blaise Pascal]].

The first 10 lines of [[wikipedia:Pascal's triangle|Pascal's triangle]] are:

                             1     4     6     4     1
                          1     5     10    10    5     1
                       1     6     15    20    15    6     1

Since each number is found by adding the two numbers above it, it is possible to find a few lines of the triangle to help you expand binomials. For binomials raised to powers greater than 10, you should use the binomial coefficient formula.

===Binomial coefficient formula===

When a binomial is raised to a large power, it may be too time consuming to find the binomial coefficients by writing out Pascal's triangle. Fortunately, there is a formula that can find any line of Pascal's triangle.

If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the power of the expansion, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the term in a single row, the binomial coefficient formula is:

&lt;math&gt;{n\choose r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;!&lt;/math&gt; means '''factorial''' and multiplies &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by every integer less than itself, down to 1.

So &lt;math&gt;3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6&lt;/math&gt;.

To find the binomial coefficients, you use the formula with the required value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r=2&lt;/math&gt;, and so on, until &lt;math&gt;r=n&lt;/math&gt;.

Most scientific calculators will have two buttons that will be useful in this process, one is the factorial button, usually labelled '''''n''!''' and the other will actually find &lt;math&gt;{n \choose r}&lt;/math&gt; and is often labelled '''''n''C''r''''' or '''&lt;math&gt;C^n_r&lt;/math&gt;'''. (The C stands for &quot;choose&quot; or &quot;combination&quot; which is based on the formula's use in probability.) 

You should be aware that Pascal's triangle is symmetrical, so once a coefficient is repeated, you can write down the rest of the coefficients with ease.

===Expanding binomials===

Now that you know how to find the coefficients in a binomial expansion, you can easily expand any binomial that is raised to a positve integer by following these simple steps:

For a binomial in the form &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n&lt;/math&gt;,

# Write down &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in descending powers, from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
# Write down &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in ascending powers, from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, making sure that you place the terms so that the powers add up to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
# Add the binomial coefficients to each term, either from line &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in Pascal's triangle (ignoring the 1 at the top), or by using the binomial coefficient formula.

You then simplify where necessary.

For example, for the expansion of &lt;math&gt;(x+2)^4&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in descending powers:
&lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; in ascending powers:
&lt;math&gt;2^0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;2^1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;2^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;2^4&lt;/math&gt;

Grouping everything together we now have:

&lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^4&lt;/math&gt;

Adding in the binomial coefficients:

&lt;math&gt;1 x^4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;4 x^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;6 x^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;4 x^1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;1 x^0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;2^4&lt;/math&gt;

Finally simplifying will now give us:

&lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;8 x^3&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;24 x^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;32 x^1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; $ 16 $

This process is summarised in the equation known as the binomial theorem:

&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n=\sum_{r=0}^n{n \choose r}x^ry^{n-r}&lt;/math&gt;

In case you are not familiar with sigma notion this means:


&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n = {n \choose 0} x^0y^n + {n \choose 1} x^1y^{n-1} + {n \choose 2} x^2y^{n-2}  + \dots  + {n \choose {n-2}}x^{n-2}y^2 + {n \choose {n-1}}x^{n-1}y^1 + {n \choose n}x^ny^0&lt;/math&gt;


Several simplifications can be made but they aren't worth memorising as you will pick them up automatically:
&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n = y^n + nxy^{n-1} + {n \choose 2} x^2y^{n-2} + \dots + {n \choose {n-2}}x^{n-2}y^2 + nx^{n-1}y + x^n&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Loops are control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met.

Visual Basic has three main types of loops: ''for..next'' loops, ''do'' loops and ''while'' loops.

Note: 'Debug' may be a reserved word in Visual Basic, and this may cause the code samples shown here to fail for some versions of Visual Basic.

==For..Next Loops==

The syntax of a ''For..Next'' loop has three components:  a ''counter'', a ''range'', and a ''step''.  A basic ''for..next'' loop appears as follows: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For X = 1 To 100 Step 2
 Debug.Print X
Next X
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, X is the counter, &quot;1 to 100&quot; is the range, and &quot;2&quot; is
the step.

The variable reference in the ''Next'' part of the statement is optional and it is common practice to leave this out.  There is no ambiguity in doing this if code is correctly indented.

When a ''For..Next'' loop is initialized, the counter is set to the first number in the range; in this case, X is set to 1.  The program then executes any code between the ''for'' and ''next'' statements normally.  Upon reaching the ''next'' statement, the program returns to the ''for'' statement and increases the value of the counter by the step.  In this instance, ''X'' will be increased to ''3'' on the second iteration, ''5'' on the third, etc.

To change the amount by which the ''counter'' variable increases on each ''iteration'', simply change the value of the ''step''.  For example, if you use a ''step'' ''3'', ''X'' will increase from ''1'' to ''4'', then to ''7, 10, 13'', and so on.  When the step is not explicitly stated, ''1'' is used by default.  (Note that the ''step'' can be a negative value.  For instance, &lt;tt&gt;for X = 100 to 1 step -1&lt;/tt&gt; would decrease the value of X from 100 to 99 to 98, etc.)

When X reaches the end of the range in the range (100 in the example above), the loop will cease to execute, and the program will continue to the code beyond the ''next'' statement.

It is possible to edit the value of the counter variable within a ''for..next'' loop, although this is generally considered bad programming practice:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For X = 1 To 100 Step 1
 Debug.Print X
 X = 7
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

While you may on rare occasions find good reasons to edit the counter
in this manner, the example above illustrates one potential pitfall:

Because X is set to 7 at the end of every iteration, this code creates
an infinite loop.  To avoid this and other unexpected behavior, use
extreme caution when editing the counter variable!

It is not required by the compiler that you specify the name of the
loop variable in the ''Next'' statement but it will be checked by the
compiler if you do, so it is a small help in writing correct programs.

===For loop on list===

Another very common situation is the need for a loop which ''enumerates'' every element of a list. The following sample code shows you how to do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim v As Variant

For Each v In list
 Debug.Print v
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

The list is commonly a Collection or Array, but can be any other object that implements an ''enumerator''. Note that the iterating variable has to be either a '''Variant''', '''Object''' or class that matches the type of elements in the list.

==Do Loops==

Do loops are a bit more flexible than For loops, but should generally only be used when necessary. Do loops come in the following formats: 

*Do while
*Do until
*Loop while
*Loop until

While loops (both do while and loop while) will continue to execute as long as a certain conditional is true. An Until loop will loop as long as a certain condition is false, on the other hand. The only difference between putting either While or Until in the Do section or the Loop section, is that Do checks when the loop starts, and Loop checks when the loop ends. An example of a basic loop is as follows: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Do
 Debug.Print &quot;hello&quot;
 x = x + 1
Loop Until x = 10
&lt;/source&gt;

This loop will print hello several times, depending on the initial value of x. As you may have noticed, Do loops have no built in counters. However, they may be made manually as shown above. In this case, I chose x as my counter variable, and every time the loop execute, x increase itself by one. When X reaches 10, the loop will cease to execute. The advantage of Do loops is that you may exit at any time whenever any certain conditional is met. You may have it loop as long as a certain variable is false, or true, or as long as a variable remains in a certain range.

===Endless loop: ''Do..Loop''===
The endless loop is a loop which never ends and the statements inside
are repeated forever. Never is meant as a relative term here - if the
computer is switched off then even endless loops will end very
abruptly.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Do
 Do_Something
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

In Visual Basic you cannot label the loop but you can of course place
a label just before it, inside it or just after it if you wish.

===Loop with condition at the beginning: ''Do While..Loop''===

This loop has a condition at the beginning. The statements are
repeated as long as the condition is met. If the condition is not met
at the very beginning then the statements inside the loop are never
executed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Do While X &lt;= 5
 X = Calculate_Something
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

===Loop with condition at the end: ''Do..Loop Until''===

This loop has a condition at the end and the statements are repeated
until the condition is met. Since the check is at the end the
statements are at least executed once.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Do
 X = Calculate_Something
Loop Until X &gt; 5
&lt;/source&gt;

===Loop with condition in the middle:''Do..Exit Do..Loop''===

Sometimes you need to first make a calculation and exit the loop when
a certain criterion is met. However when the criterion is not met
there is something else to be done. Hence you need a loop where the
exit condition is in the middle.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Do
 X = Calculate_Something
 If X &gt; 10 then
  Exit Do  
 End If
 Do_Something (X)
Loop
&lt;/source&gt;

In Visual Basic you can also have more than one exit statement. You
cannot exit named outer loops using ''Exit Do'' because Visual Basic does
not provide named loops; you can of course use Goto instead to jump to
a label that follows the outer loop.

==While Loops==

While loops are similar to Do loops except that the tested condition always appears at the top of the loop.  If on the first entry into the loop block the condition is false, the contents of the loop are never executed.  The condition is retested before every loop iteration.  

An example of a While loop is as follows: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    price = 2
    
    While price &lt; 64
        Debug.Print &quot;Price = &quot; &amp; price
        price = price ^ 2
    Wend
    
    Debug.Print &quot;Price = &quot; &amp; price &amp; &quot;:  Too much for the market to bear!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The While loop will run until the condition tests false - or until an &quot;Exit While&quot; statement is encountered.

==Nested Loops==

A nested loop is any type of loop inside an already existing loop. They can involve any type of loop. For this, we will use For loops. It is important to remember that the inner loop will execute its normal amount multiplied by how many times the outer loop runs. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
For i = 1 To 10
 For j = 1 To 2
  Debug.Print &quot;hi&quot;
 Next
Next
&lt;/source&gt;

This will print the word 'hi' twenty times. Upon the first pass of the ''i''
loop, it will run the ''j'' loop twice. Then on the second pass of the ''i''
loop, it will run the ''j'' loop another two times, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Arrays are extremely useful in Visual Basic, and are present in many other programming languages. Arrays are used to group similar data together, to make it easier to search and sort through this data. The best way to look at an array is to show you one. Say you want to make a phone book for your computer. Rather than make a new variable with a new name whenever you want to add a name, you can make an array. Arrays consist of the variable name and a subscript, which is put in parentheses for computer use. So, if you want to make a phone
book of say, 100 people, rather than make a bunch of variables named 'person1, person2, person3....person100', you may use an array. All you have to do is dimension the array (see above). So now those 100 variables turn into person(1 to 100) in a dim statement. Now you may
be asking, what do I do now? Each object stored in an array is called an element. What you have done is created an array which can hold 100 elements. If you want to print the 32nd person in your phone book, you simply would type:

  Debug.Print Person(32)

==Use of Arrays==

Arrays have far more uses other than just making phone books. But before we get into specific uses, let's look at some of the basic techniques used when working with arrays. The first thing you may want to do is learn how to easily fill an array. Filling an array with random numbers is a popular technique for starting off programs, and testing other techniques such as sorting. To fill an array, a simple For Loop may be used.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  Dim lngIndex as Long
  Dim strArray(0 to 9) as String ' Create an array with 10 values
  Dim intCounter as Integer
  intCounter = 1
  For lngIndex = LBound(strArray) to UBound(strArray)
     intCounter = intCounter + 1
     strArray(lngIndex) = intCounter
  Next lngIndex
&lt;/source&gt;

The above shows an example of read-write iteration over an array. ''For Each'' loop can be used for read-only iteration over an array:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MyArray(9)
  For i = 0 To 9
    MyArray(i) = i
  Next
  For Each Item In MyArray
    Debug.Print Item
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Indices==
Per default, array '''indices start''' at 0, unless &quot;Option Base 1&quot; declaration is used. Without the declaration used, an array declared as &quot;Dim MyArray(5)&quot; has 6 elements: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The '''index range''' of an array has to be a continuous sequence of integers, including negative numbers. Thus, the following is possible:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MyArray1(-5 to 5)
  Dim MyArray2(-10 to -5)
  For i = LBound(MyArray1) to UBound(MyArray1)
     MyArray1(i) = i + 5
     Debug.Print i, MyArray1(i)
  Next
  For i = LBound(MyArray2) to UBound(MyArray2)
     MyArray2(i) = i + 5
     Debug.Print i, MyArray2(i)
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

==Size==
The size of an array can be obtained using LBound and UBound as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MyArray1(-5 to 5)
  Dim MyArray2(10-1)
  Size1 = UBound(MyArray1) -  LBound(MyArray1) + 1
  Size2 = UBound(MyArray2) + 1 'For a same array with indexing starting at zero
  Debug.Print Size1, Size2 
&lt;/source&gt;
Keywords: length, item count, element count.

==Dynamic Arrays==

An array with the number of elements specified upon its declaration, as in Dim Names(0 to 9), is a static one: the number of its elements cannot be changed in runtime. By contrast, an array declared without the number of elements, as in Dim Names(), is a ''dynamic array'', and its number of elements can be changed using ReDim. To preserve the element content of the array when using ReDim, Preserve keyword has to be used after ReDim.

Say you have a phone book program running and it has an array of your friends' names, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  Dim StrNames(0 to 2) As String
  StrNames(0) = &quot;Alec&quot;
  StrNames(1) = &quot;Jack&quot;
  StrNames(2) = &quot;Pie&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
But say you want to add ''more'' friends to your phone book, when a button is clicked, for example. What do you do? You can '''define a dynamic array''' instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim Names() As String
&lt;/source&gt;

This array initially has no elements.  You can add more elements, by using the ReDim keyword:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ReDim Names(0 to 1) As String
&lt;/source&gt;

This would create two new elements.  You can assign names to these elements in the same way as before:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Names(0) = &quot;Alec&quot;
  Names(1) = &quot;Jack&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to add more entries then use, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ReDim Names(0 to 2) As String
&lt;/source&gt;

But you'll end up losing all the old records! If you want to keep them, you must also use the Preserve keyword:
  
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ReDim Preserve Names(0 To 3) As String
  Names(1) = &quot;Eugene H / Orage&quot; 'Whoa this person's name is too long to remember
&lt;/source&gt;

To iterate AKA '''loop over''' the elements of a '''dynamic array''', you have to use LBound and UBound functions or For Each loop, as described at [[#Use of Arrays]].

To '''add an element''' to an initialized dynamic array, you can proceed as follows, using UBound function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ReDim Preserve Names(0 To UBound(Names) + 1) As String
  Names(UBound(Names)) = &quot;my new friend&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, UBound does not work with an un-initialized dynamic array, so the following would cause a run-time error:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MyArray() As String
  Debug.Print UBound(MyArray)
&lt;/source&gt;

One way to avoid this run-time error is to keep a flag:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim ArrayIsEmpty As Boolean
  Dim MyArray() As String
  
  ArrayIsEmpty = True
  
  If Not ArrayIsEmpty Then
      ReDim Preserve MyArray(0 To UBound(MyArray) + 1) As String
  Else
      ReDim Preserve Names(0 To 0) As String
      ArrayIsEmpty = False
  End If
  Names(UBound(Names)) = &quot;my new friend&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way to avoid the run-time error is to catch the error created by the use of &quot;UBound&quot; on an uninitialized array:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MyArray() As String
 
  NumberOfElements = 0
  On Error Resume Next
  NumberOfElements = UBound(MyArray) + 1
  On Error GoTo 0
  ReDim Preserve MyArray(0 To NumberOfElements) As String
  MyArray(UBound(MyArray)) = &quot;my new friend&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, you can use the following ''hack'' to check if a dynamic array has been initialized:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim MyArray() As String
 
  If (Not MyArray) = -1 Then    
    NumberOfElements = 0 'The array is uninitialised
  Else
    NumberOfElements = UBound(MyArray) + 1
  End If
  ReDim Preserve MyArray(0 To NumberOfElements) As String
  MyArray(UBound(MyArray)) = &quot;my new friend&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Variant Arrays==

Variant arrays are dynamic arrays declared using the Variant type, and initialized using &quot;= Array()&quot;. Their advantage is that, after they are initialized using &quot;= Array()&quot;, LBound and UBound functions work with them even when they have no elements, as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim VariantArray As Variant
  
  VariantArray = Array()

  Debug.Print LBound(VariantArray) 'Prints 0
  Debug.Print UBound(VariantArray) 'Prints -1
&lt;/source&gt;

As a consequence, adding an element is straightforward, with no need to check for UBound failure:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  ReDim Preserve VariantArray(0 To UBound(VariantArray) + 1) As Variant
  VariantArray(UBound(VariantArray)) = &quot;Jennifer&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Variant arrays can be initialized to a set of values:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim VariantArray As Variant  
  VariantArray = Array(1, 2.3, &quot;Hey&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

For very large arrays, the overhead of using variant arrays, which have the element type of Variant rather than String or other narrower type, may well be restrictive, in which case conventional dynamic arrays should be used. What seems also much faster than variant arrays for adding items one at a time are [[../Collections/]].

==Multi-Dimensional Arrays==

Arrays can be defined to have any number of dimensions (or indices), by listing the sizes of each dimension:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim FunkyArray(2,3,1,4) As String
&lt;/source&gt;

An element can be referenced like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  FunkyArray(1,2,0,3) = 24
&lt;/source&gt;

Dynamic arrays can also be re-dimensioned to have any number of dimensions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim VeryFunkyArray() as String
  
  ReDim VeryFunkyArray(2,2,2) As String
&lt;/source&gt;

The LBound and UBound functions can be used to find the bounds of a particular dimension:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Debug.Print UBound(FunkyArray, 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

Would give 4.

Using UBound without the second parameter gives the first dimension

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Debug.Print UBound(FunkyArray)
  ' Displays 2
  Debug.Print UBound(VeryFunkyArray)
  ' Displays 2
&lt;/source&gt;

==Erasing Arrays==

Any type of array can be re-set to empty by using:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Erase SomeArray
&lt;/source&gt;

==Mixing Arrays==

The real power of arrays comes when defining arrays of arrays.  What does this mean? Declare an array:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim VariantArray() As Variant
  
  VariantArray = Array()
  
  ReDim VariantArray(1) As Variant
  
  VariantArray(0) = Array(1,2,3)
  VariantArray(1) = Array(4,5,6)
&lt;/source&gt;

What do we have here? Essentially two arrays inside another. They can be referenced like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Debug.Print VariantArray(0)(2) 
&lt;/source&gt;

Would show 3.

You can nest arrays like this to any depth and in any order and they can be of any size. A note of caution must be taken when using the ReDim statement, however. You cannot specifically re-dimension a particular dimension of an array; instead you need to temporarily copy to a variant.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim vtemp As Variant
  
  vtemp = VariantArray(0)
   
  ReDim vtemp(1+UBound(vtemp)) As Variant
  vtemp(UBound(vtemp)) = 7
  
  VariantArray(0) = vtemp
&lt;/source&gt;

==Use of Matrices==

''See also the section [[#Multi-Dimensional Arrays]].

Matrices are not as commonly used as arrays, but are an important element of programming. Rather than just one dimension, a matrix may have 2 or more. So, to make a matrix, the Dim statement would be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim Matrix(0 To 9, 0 To 9) as Integer
&lt;/source&gt;

This will create a matrix that is 10 by 10 and comprised of integers. In reality, a matrix is much like an array of arrays. The first thing you'll want to do is know how to create a loop for reading and filling a matrix. But before that, even, you should know how matrices are structured. An example matrix would be:
    
      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
     
   1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
   2  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
   3  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
   4  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This is a 4 by 9 matrix. When talking about matrices, rows are always stated before columns. You will also notice column numbers travel from left to right, while row numbers travel from top to bottom. This is very important. And of course, matrices need not consist of merely 1s.
So, now you want to fill a matrix? Its very similar to an array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  For Row = 0 To 3
      For Column = 0 To 8
          Matrix(Row, Column)=1
      Next
  Next
&lt;/source&gt;

This will of course fill the matrix with nothing but ones, but random numbers may be used (see references). As you may notice, this involves nested loops. The loop fills left to right, top to bottom (the same directions we use when reading).

==Sorting==
For sorting variant arrays, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152319/vba-array-sort-function.

del senior Runde: Quando le scena comencia, Petro
telephona le senior Runde, dicente que tosto ille
essera in su officio post un breve viage in un taxi.

Illes parla sur le aeroporto de Frankfurt e se demanda
lo que occurreva con Sophia, le secretaria del senior
Runde, qui iva portar Petro al officios de Elektrobahn
in Frankfurt in un automobile del compania. Le
senior Runde pare esser confidente que su secretaria

apprendite exactemente que face vos illac. Esque
vos pote dar me un parve tour.

Senior Runde: Si naturalmente. Ah, un altere cosa:
Esque vos habera besonio de cosas special pro vostre
presentation, como photocopias o altere cosas similar?

Petro: No, io ha con me omne lo que io necessita.

Senior Runde: Esque vos ha un description imprimite
de vostre projecto?

Petro: No. Io va simplemente exponer le grande
lineas del projecto e explicar le programma que
nos ha establite pro Geneva de maniera que vos sapera
como vos pote usar nostre servicios nove.


EXERCITIO 3: Fixar un incontro con alicuno.

Guida: Io me demanda qual es le melior maniera
de fixar un incontro con alicuno.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENA 1: Le officios de Geneva: Martijn Ockrente
e Olivero Rossi, post audir le nova del projecto
egyptian, es multo felice. Illes parla con Catherina
sur le tempore e le loco de lor reunion le proxime
matino. Catherina tunc vade via, e Martijn e Olivero
parla sur le projecto e le possibilitates de assecurar
le contracto pro Marex.

Martijn explica como a vices il es possibile eluder
le leges sur le publicitate e le offertas public,
le quales sovente non es tan public como illos appare.
Il es facile, ille dice, decider anticipatemente
qui va ganiar le contracto e dar a un compania
preferite multe tempore pro preparar su presentation,
e un insufficientia de tempore al altere candidatos.
Omnes es de accordo que il ha pauco que illes pote
facer durante iste parte del processo, ma Olivero
vole examinar le contos.

Catherina, qui ha retornate al officio, rememora
a Petro que illes va sortir pro dinar e dice a Olivero
que ille non debe travaliar troppo iste vespere.
Olivero e Martijn se ride un pauco de Petro proque
ille va sortir con Catherina e dice que ille debe
cambiar a nove vestimentos ante sortir con illa.

Martijn: Illo vermente es un bon nova!

Catherina: Si.

Olivero: Le reunion deman es a que hora?

Catherina: A dece horas.

Martijn: Possibilemente il esserea un bon idea
que nos nos reuni un pauco avante.

Olivero: Si.

Catherina: Io va facer photocopiar iste papiros.
Io vos revidera tosto.

Martijn: Multo ben.

Olivero: On non ha le tempore pro facer un offerta
complete.

Martijn: Illo non es necesse.

Olivero: Ma nos debera facer isto ante multe tempore.

Martijn: Si, ma deman il suffice que nos sia amabile.

Olivero: E competente.

Martijn: E intelligente. Solmente isto essera
necesse deman.

Olivero: Ma seriosemente, qual es le probabilitate
que nos obtenera iste contracto? Si illo es pro
le governamento, nos debera facer un offerta public.

Martijn: Sin dubita, si.

Olivero: E si on debe facer un offerta public,
illo significa que omne le mundo pote submitter
alique.

Martijn: Exactemente.

Olivero: Le japoneses, le americanos, le svedeses,
omnes.

Martijn: Si.

Olivero: E tunc illes va seliger le offerta le
plus economic, e possibilemente ...

Martijn: Si, ma attende.

Olivero: Que?

Martijn: Le offertas public non es sempre tan public
como forsan tu crede.

Olivero: Ma illos debe esser assi, secundo le regulas
del joco. E certemente il ha leges pro illo. In
omne le paises il es assi.

Martijn: Si, ma il ha diverse manieras de manipular
le conditiones legal.

Olivero: Como?

Martijn: Eh, ben, pro exemplo, tu publica un annuncio
in jornales differente in le qual tu dice &quot;Se sollicita
offertas pro un importante projecto de developpamento.&quot;

Olivero: Si?

Martijn: Tunc tu adde: &quot;Le offertas debe esser
facite in un periodo de vinti un dies.&quot; Non vide
tu? Qui pote facer un offerta complete in tres
septimanas?

Olivero: Eh ben, il ha possibilemente alicuno que
pote facer isto.

Martijn: Naturalmente. In ille caso tu adde:
&quot;Pro detalios ulterior, scribe nos ... &quot; Illes
non pote preparar un offerta ante haber disponibile
le detalios precise. E tunc tu invia a illes iste
information solmente un septimana ante le data de
clausura.

Olivero: Ah, io comprende. Illo es astute. E
durante ille tempore ...

Martijn: Exactemente, durante ille tempore tu decide
qui tu vole seliger pro completar le projecto.
Tu da a illes un septimana extra, e tu invia a illes
le detalios complete ante que le alteres lo recipe.

(Petro entra.)

Petro: Bon die a omnes.

Martijn: Salute, Petro.

Petro: De que parlava vos?

Martijn: Del projecto egyptian, le reunion de deman.

Olivero: Martijn me diceva que le offertas public
non es sempre completemente public.

Petro: Como?

Olivero: Tu selige anticipatemente le interprisa
que obtenera iste contracto. Tu da a illo assatis
tempore pro preparar un offerta e minus tempore
a omne le alteres.

Petro: Multo astute!

Martijn: Illo es solmente un maniera de approchar
se a iste problema. Il anque ha alteres.

Olivero: Ma esque il non apparerea irregular haber
un sol offerta?

Martijn: In ille caso tu demanda que illes submitte
tres offertas differente.

Olivero: Eh ben! ... Io es plus felice esser in
le contabilitate e non in le marketing. Illo non
es multo honeste.

Martijn: Ma le affaires es assi. On sempre debe
accommodar se al realitate.

Olivero: Si. E io debe examinar unes numeros.

Martijn: De omne manieras, on non pote facer multo
iste vespere.

Olivero: Io vole solmente facer un examination
breve pro cognoscer le limites un pauco.

Catherina: Bon die.

Olivero: Bon die, Catherina.

Catherina: Omne es preste pro deman?

Martijn: Io crede que si.

Olivero: Martijn justo nunc nos ha explicate le
differente medios de manipular un offerta public.
Il ha diverse manieras multo astute.

Catherina: Ma lor uso non depende de nos. Il es
le interprenditor qui decide. Si il es vos que
ille vole, ille trovara un maniera de assecurar
que vos essera seligite. Ben. Vos claudera le
officio iste vespere?

Olivero: Eh, ben, io vole travaliar un pauco sur
le numeros e verificar unes detalios.

Catherina: Multo ben, si vos vermente vole. Petro,
esque nos va sortir iste vespere pro dinar?

Petro: Si, si ...

Catherina: Bon, eh ben, io va a mi appartamento
pro cambiar de vestimentos. Esque tu pote trovar
me illac verso septe horas e medie?

Petro: Multo ben Io essera illac.

Catherina: A revider. E Martijn e Olivero, non
travalia troppo iste vespere. On debera esser in
bon forma deman.

Olivero: Si, vos ha ration. A deman.

Martijn: Multo ben.

Catherina: A revider.

Olivero: Ah ha!

Martijn: Que significa illo?

Olivero: (Imitante Catherina) &quot;Io va a mi
appartamento pro cambiar de vestimentos. Esque
tu pote trovar me verso septe horas e medie?&quot;

Martijn: Io spera, Petro, que vos va amusar vos
multo ben iste vespere.

Petro: Ah, vos dice omne illo proque vos es jelose.

Olivero: No. Io solmente recognosce que il es
un medio, como multe alteres, de ganiar successo
in le affaires ...

Martijn: Ma io credeva que illa sortiva con ille
switze.

Petro: No, illa ha terminate su relationes con
ille.

Olivero: Tunc il es vos qui va jocar iste vice,
Petro. Bon sorte!

Petro: Io non ha ulle tempore pro isto. Io va
preparar me pro iste vespere.

Olivero: Si, e no oblida le ducha e le vestimentos
munde.

Petro: Si, si. Io nunc debe vader via.

Martijn: A revider. Amusa vos ben.

Olivero: A revider.


EXERCITIO 1: Opportunitates pro successo.

Guida: Io ha trovate illo un pauco difficile.
De que parlava ille exactemente? Obtener le
contracto? Signar le contracto? Il anque habeva
altere parolas que io non ha comprendite multe ben.

Un homine: Aeroporto de Tripoli. Appello pro offertas
pro construer hangars in le aeroporto de Tripoli?
Que es illo?

Un femina: Illo es un annuncio.

Un homine: Illo es in le jornal.

Un femina: Illo es un annuncio in un jornal.

Un homine: Illes vole que le companias que lege
le annuncio ...

Un femina: ... face un offerta.

Un homine: Illo appareva in le jornal. Tunc, ...

Un femina: ... illo es un appello pro un offerta
public.

Guida: Si, io comprende. Il habeva anque questiones
de opportunitates pro successo.

Un homine: Esque il es public?

Un femina: Illo es in le jornal. Si illo es in
le jornal, illo es public.

Un homine: Tunc ulle compania pote facer un offerta?

Un femina: Si, proque illo es un offerta public
in un jornal.

Un homine: Esque io anque pote participar?

Un femina: Vos vole participar? Vos pote si vos
vole.

Un homine: Esque io debe scriber a illes?

Un femina: Si. Scribe a illes si vos vole.

Un homine: Vos crede que io recipera le contracto?

Un femina: Io non sape. Esque vostre precios es
correcte? Vos recipera le contracto si vostre precios
es correcte.

Un homine: Vos pensa que illo es possibile?

Un femina: Io non sape. Vos ha le competentias
requirite. Ma vos es un mercante de aqua mineral!

Un homine: Si, ma io pote participar si io vole!

Guida: Ille es comic, ille mercante de aqua mineral.
Ma que nos vide lo que va passar quando Petro e
Catherina sortira pro dinar iste vespere.


SCENA 2: Geneva: In un restaurante: In iste scena
nos trova Petro e Catherina in un restaurante ordinante
un repasto. Petro deveni infelice quando ille discoperi
que on pote dansar illac solmente le venerdis e
le sabbatos. Quando illes ordina lor repastos, Petro
vole alique calide, e ille time que ille non va
haber assatis pro mangiar. Ille ha multe fame.

Le garson prende lor ordine, e Petro demanda si
ille habera assatis a mangiar. Le garson le assecura
que le portiones es multo generose ma que ille poterea
haber un portion supplementari si ille ha multe
fame. Catherina ordina carne de cervo, ma le cocina
non lo ha in iste momento, e le garson suggere
alternativas.

Petro: Il pare que isto es un bon restaurante.

Catherina: Si, illo pare multo bon.

Petro: E on anque pote dansar. E il ha un cabaret.

Catherina: Si, io lo ha vidite. Ma io anque ha
vidite que on pote dansar solmente le venerdi e
le sabbato.

Petro: Ubi ha tu vidite illo?

Catherina: Sur la porta. Illo dice &quot;Dancing e
Cabaret, le venerdi e le sabbato.&quot;

Petro: Ah, illo es regrettabile.

Catherina: Illo non importa. Le restaurante mesme
es multo agradabile.

Petro: Si, ma io voleva dansar.

Catherina: Eh ben, forsan illes vos lassara dansar,
si vos insiste.

Garson: Esque vos volerea ordinar immediatemente?

Catherina: Oh, io non ha potite vider un menu.

Petro: Un momento. Nos nos non es completemente
preste.

Garson: Io revenira in un minuta.

Petro: Que nos vide. Que ha il que sia bon?

Catherina: Ah, carne ce cervo. Io crede que io
va ordinar illo.

Petro: Io vole qualque cosa calide.

Catherina: Ah, il ha suppa de pisce, o soufflé

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: The Geneva offices: Martijn Ockrente
and Olivero Rossi, after hearing the news of the
Egyptian project, are very happy. They talk with
Catherina about the time and place of their meeting
the next morning. Catherina then goes away, and
Martijn and Olivero speak about the project and
the possibilities of getting the contract for Marex.

Martijn explains how at times it is possible to
get around the advertising laws and public offerings,
which are often not as public as they appear. It
is easy, he says, to decide in advance who is going
to get the contract and to give a lot of time to
a preferred company to prepare its presentation
and not enough time to the other applicants. Everyone
agrees that there is little they can do during this
part of the process, but Oliver wants to examine
the accounts.

Catherina, who has returned to the office, reminds
Petro that they are going to go out to eat and tells
Olivero that he should not work too hard this evening.
Olivero and Martijn laugh a little at Petro for
going out with Catherina and say that he should
change clothes before picking her up.

Martijn; That is really a good piece of news.

Catherina: Yes.

Olivero: What time is the meeting tomorrow?

Catherina: At ten o'clock.

Martijn: Possibly it would be a good idea for us
to get together a little early.

Olivero: Yes.

Catherina: I'm gonna photocopy these papers. I'll
see you soon.

Martijn: Okay.

Olivero: We don't have the time to make a complete
offer.

Martijn: We don't have to.

Olivero: But we'll have to do so before too long.

Martijn: Yes, but tomorrow it will be okay if we
are just nice.

Olivero: And competent.

Martijn: And intelligent. Only that will be necessary
tomorrow.

Olivero: But seriously, what is the possibility
that we will get this contract? If it is for the
government, we will have to make a public offering.

Martijn: No doubt, yes.

Olivero: And if we have to make a public offering,
that means that anyone can submit something.

Martijn: Exactly.

Olivero: The Japanese, the Americans, the Swedish,
everyone.

Martijn: Yes.

Olivero: And then they are going to select the
lowest offer, and possibly ...

Martijn: Yes, but wait.

Olivero: What?

Martijn: Public offers are not always as public
as you may believe.

Olivero: But they have to be like that, according
to the rules of the game. And certainly there are
laws for that. In all countries things are like
that.

Martijn: Yes, but there are various ways of
minipulating the legal requirements.

Olivero: How?

Martijn: Okay, for example, you publish an ad in
different newspapers in which you say &quot;Offers are
being solicited for an important development project.&quot;

Olivero: Yes?

Martijn: Then you add &quot;The offers should be made
in a period of twenty-one days.&quot; Don't you see?
Who can make a complete offer in three weeks?

Olivero: All right, there is possibly someone out
there who can do this.

Martijn: Naturally. In that case, you add: &quot;For
further details, write us ... &quot; They can't prepar
an offer before having available the exact details.
And then you send them this information only a week
before the closing date.

Olivero: Ah, I understand. That is astute. And
during that time ...

Martijn: Exactly, during that time you decide who
you want to select to finish the project. You give
them a week extra, and you send them the complete
details before the others get them.

(Petro comes in.)

Petro: Good morning to everyone.

Martijn: Hello, Petro.

Petro: What were you talking about?

Martijn: About the Egyptian project, the meeting
tomorrow.

Olivero: Martijn told me that public offers are
not always completely public.

Petro: How?

Olivero: You select in advance the company that
will get this contract. You give them enough time
to prepare an offer and less time to all the others.

Petro: Very astute!

Martijn: That is only one way of approaching this
problem. There are also others.

Olivero: But won't it seem irregular to have only
one offer?

Martijn: In that case you ask them to submit three
different offers.

Olivero: Well, I must say I'm happier to be in
accounting and not in marketing. It isn't very
honest.

Martijn: But business is like that. You have to
come to terms with reality.

Olivero: Yes. And I have to examine some numbers.

Martijn: In any event, not much can be done this
evening.

Olivero: I only want to take a brief look to learn
the limits a little.

Catherina: Good morning.

Olivero: Good Morning, Catherina.

Catherina: Is everything ready for tomorrow?

Martijn: I think so.

Olivero: Martijn just now finished explaining to
us the different ways of manipulating a public
offering. There are various ways that are quite
astute.

Catherina: But their use is not up to us. It is
the entrpreneur who will decide. If it is you who
he wants, he will find a way of making sure that
you are selected. Okay. Are you going to close
up the office this evening?

Olivero: Uh, I want to work a little on the numbers
and verify some details.

Catherina: Fine, if you really want to do that.
Petro, are we gonna go out to eat tonight?

Petro: Yes, if ...

Catherina: Good. Okay, I'm gonna go to my apartment
to change clothes. Can you come get me there around
seven thirty?

Petro: Fine. I'll be there.

Catherina: See you then. And Martijn and Oliver,
don't work too hard this evening. We will have
to be in good form tomorrow.

Olivero: Yes, you're right. See you tomorrow.

Martijn: Fine.

Catherina: See you later.

Olivero: Ah ha!

Martijn: What do you mean by that?

Olivero: (Imitating Catherina) &quot;I'm gonna go to
my apartment to change clothes. Can you come get
me there around seven thirty?&quot;

Martijn: I hope, Petro, that you are gonna have
a lot of fun this evening.

Petro: Oh, you're only saying that because you're
jealous.

Olivero: No. I simply understand that it is one
way, like many others, of getting ahead in business.

Martijn: But I thought she was going out with that
Swiss guy.

Petro: No, she put an end to their relationship.

Olivero: So you're the one who's gonna play this
time, Petro. Good luck!

Petro: I haven't got any time for this. I've gotta
get ready for this evening.

Olivero: Yes, and don't forget to take a shower
and change your clothes.

Petro: Yeah, yeah. I've gotta get outta here.

Martijn: See you. Have fun.

Olivero: See you.


EXERCISE 1: Opportunities for success.

Guide: I have found that a little difficult. What
was he talking about exactly? Getting the contract?
Signing the contract? There were also some other
words that I didn't understand very well.

A man: An appeal for offers to build hangars at
the Tripoli Airport. What's that?

A woman: It's an advertisement.

A man: It's in the paper.

A woman: Its a newspaper ad.

A man: They want that the compnies reading the
ad ...

A woman: ... make an offer.

A man: It appeared in the paper. Then, ...

a woman: ... it is an appeal for a public offering.

Guide: Yes, I understand. There were some questions
about opportunities for success.

A man: Is it public?

A woman: It is in the paper. If it is in the paper,
it is public.

A man: Then any company can make an offer?

A woman: Yes, because it is a public offer in a
newspaper.

A man: Can I participate too?

A woman: Do you want to participate? You can if
you want.

A man: Will I have to write them?

A woman: Yes. Write them if you want.

A man: Do you think I'll get the contract?

A woman: I don't know. Are your prices right?
You will get the contracto if your prices are right.

A man: Do you think that's possible?

A woman: I don't know. You have the necessary
skills. But you are a seller of mineral water!

A man: Yes, but I can pariticipate if I want!

Guide: He's funny, that guy who sells mineral water.
But let's see what's gonna happen when Petro and
Catherina go out to dinner this evening.


SCENE 2: Geneva: In a restaurant: In this scene
we find Petro and Catherina in a restaurant ordering
a meal. Petro becomes unhappy when he discovers
that people can dance there only Fridays and
Saturdays. When they order their meals, Peter wants
something hot, and he is afraid he won't have enough
to eat. He is very hungry.

The waiter takes their order, and Petro asks if
he will have enough to eat. The waiter assures
him that the portions are very generous but that
he can have a supplementary portion if he is really
very hungry. Catherina asks for venison, but the
kitchen doesn't have it at this moment, and the
waiter suggests alternatives.

Petro: This seems to be a good restaurant.

Catherina: Yes, it seems very good.

Petro: And you can dance here, and there is a bar.

Catherina: Yes, I've seen it. But I've also seen
that you can only dance here on Fridays and Saturdays.

Petro: Where did you see that?

Catherina: On the door. It says &quot;The bar is open
for dancing only on Fridays and Saturdays.&quot;

Petro: Oh, that's unfortunate.

Catherina: That's not important. The restaurant
itself is very nice.

Petro: Yes, but I wanted to dance.

Catherina: Okay, maybe they'll let you dance, if
you insist.

Waiter: Would the two of you care to order right
now?

Catherina: Oh, I haven't been able to look at your
menu yet.

Petro: Just a moment. We're not completely ready.

Waiter: I'll be back in a minute.

Petro: Let's see. What is there that's good?

Catherina: Ah, venison. I think I'm gonna order
that.

Petro: I want something hot.

Catherina: Ah, there is fish soup, or asparagus
souffle. That should be hot.

Petro: Yes. I think I'm gonna order the souffle,
but I'm wondering if I'll have enough. I'm very
hungry.

Catherina: You can always order a side dish of
potatoes or something similar.

Waiter: Are you ready to order?

Catherina: Yes. I'd like an avocado with shrimp.

Waiter: Fine, madame. And for you, sir?

Petro: I'd like an asparagus souffle. Tell me
something: Are your portions large?

Waiter: Yes, sir. They are really quite large.
If you want, you can always order an extra portion.

Petro: Very good.

Waiter: And you, madame, what would you prefer
as an entree?

Catherina: I'd like to have some venison.

Waiter: Ah, madame, I'm very srry. There's no venison
in the kitchen right now. But the mutton is
excellent. And we also have a chicken entree that
is exceptionally good.


EXERCISE 2:

Guide: Okay. All this dialogue took place in a
restaurant. I'd like to review a little what people
say in a restaurant. First, how do you summon a
waiter?

A woman: Waiter!

Waiter: Yes, what would you like, madame?

A woman: I'd like to see the menu, please.

Waiter: The menu, ... there is one on your table,
madame.

A woman: No, that is the wine list.

Waiter: Excuse me. I'll go get you a menu. Here
it is.

A woman: Thank you.

Waiter: Have you selected anything?

A woman: I'm gonna order a fish plate.

Waiter: Very good, and what kind of vegetables
would you like?

A woman: Peas and potatoes, please.

Waiter: Peas and potatos, very good. And would
you also like a salad?

A woman: No, thanks. No salad.

Waiter: And to drink?

A woman: A half bottle of white wine.

Guide: I think that I understand that. And at
the end of the meal? She will have to ask the waiter
for the check.

A woman: Waiter!

Waiter: Yes, do you want something for dessert?

A woman: No, thanks. I would like the check.

Waiter: Certainly. Did you like your meal?

A woman: Yes. It was great, thanks. What is that?

Waiter: What?

A woman: The seventeen euros.

Waiter: That's the service charge, madame.

A woman: I see. It certainly is expensive!

Guide: Let's hear what Catherina and Petro say
to each other after the meal:

scene Petro drives Catherina to her apartment.
She gives him her thanks for the meal and the drink
afterward in the bar. Petro offers to take her
to another bar for a last drink, but Catherina says
she wants to feel in good form the next day and
prefers to go directly to her apartment.

Petro tries to persuade her to invite him up for
some coffee, but Catherina obviously doesn't want
to risk a romantic encounter this evening. Petro
then suggests that they go out the next evening,
but Catherina does not want to commit herself to
anything. They say good night to each other, and
Peter goes away.

Catherina: Well, thanks a lot for inviting me to
go out with you this evening, Petro.

Petro: It was a pleasure.

Catherina: The restaurant was excellent. And the
cabaret also was very pleasant.

Petro: We can go get a nightcap, if you want.
There are other bars in this area.

Catherina: No, I think I oughtta go to my apartment.

Petro: Really?

Catherina: Yes. I don't want to be hung over
tomorrow.

Petro: Okay.

Catherina: I'm very sorry that you weren't able
to dance.

Petro: Oh, that wasn't very important. We can
do it some other time.

Catherina: Fine. Good night and thanks once again.

Petro: You're not going to invite me up to your
apartment for some coffee?

Catherina: No. I don't think that it would be
a good idea since it's so late.

Petro: That isn't very nice.

Catherina: I'm very sorry, but some coffee could
easily lead to something else, and ...

Petro: And what would be bad about that?

Catherina: No. I hope that you will understand
that I have to get a good night's sleep with all
that we will be having to do tomorrow.

Petro: Can we go out together once again tomorrow
evening?

Catherina: Maybe. Let's discuss that tomorrow.

Petro: Very well.

Catherina: So I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

Petro: Yes, of course, see you tomorrow.

Catherina: Good night, and thanks.

Petro: Good night.


EXERCISE 3: Saying good-bye:

A woman: They're going away right now. What is
he going to say?

A man: Okay, &quot;Good Evening.&quot; And what is she going
to say?

A woman: &quot;Good evening. And thanks.&quot; Is he gonna
talk about the next day?

A man: &quot;Will I see you tomorrow? Will we be seeing
each other tomorrow?&quot; What is she going to say?

A woman: &quot;Yes. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll be
seeing each other tomorrow.&quot; And as far as he's
concerned, did he like the evening? If this is
true, what would he say?

A man: &quot;Thanks for the very nice evening.&quot; And
as far as she is concerned, did she also like the
evening? If this is so, what would she say?

A woman: &quot;I've had a very nice evening.&quot; They
are now taking leave of each other. What would
they say in this case?

A man: Good night.

A woman: Good night.

A man: Sleep well.

A woman: Thanks. You too.

A man: See you tomorrow.

A woman: Yes, see you tomorrow.

Guide: Good. It is now the morning when Catherina
and the entire Geneva office team are going to confer
with Mr. Chahine at his hotel.

SCENE 4: In the Geneva offices and Mr. Chahine's
hotel. Everyone in the office is ready to go to
Mr. Chahine's hotel. Martijn wants some information
from Petro about what he and Catherina did last evening,
but Petro doesn't say anything to him about this.
Catherine arrives at the office. Since her car
is a little small for four people, Martijn offers
to drive Olivero to the hotel in his own car so
that Catherina can go there with Petro in hers.

When they arrive at the hotel, Catherina calls Mohammed
up in his room to tell him that they have arrived,
and they go up to see him. Mohammed is very happy
to see Catherina, who he hasn't seen for five years.
Catherina introduces Mohammed to her three colleagues.
He invites them into his suite and then orders coffee
for six people.

Martijn: Good morning, Petro.

Petro: Good morning, Martijn.

Martijn: How're you doing?

Petro: Fine, thanks.

Martijn: Did you have a good time last night?

Petro: Yes, it was nice, thanks.

Martijn: Tell me all about it.

Petro: What do you mean?

Martijn: I mean, what did you do with the boss?

Petro: Oh, I don't want to talk about it.

Martijn: Okay, fine.

Catherina: Good morning to all of you.

The others: Good morning.

Catherina: Is everybody ready?

The others: Yes.

Catherina: We've gotta go to the hotel before too
long.

Martijn: Where's Olivero?

Catherina: He's not in the office right now, but
he's ready. How're we gonna go there? My car's
a little small for all four of us.

Martijn: Okay, ... uh, if you want, I could take
Olivero there in my car, and you and Petro could
go there in yours.

Petro: Fine.

Martijn: We can meet in the lobby.

Catherina: Good idea.


IN THE HOTEL:

Petro: Do you know his room number?

Catherina: He doesn't have a room. He has a suite.

Petro: Really? But do you know its number?

Catherina: Yes. Five hundred thirteen. I'm gonna
tell the desk clerk that we're going up to see him.
Excuse me.

Desk clerk: Just a minute please. ... What can
I do for you?

Catherina: Can you call up Suite five hundred thirteen
and tell them that we're gonna go up there?

Desk clerk: There's a house phone. It's over there.
Can you see it?

Catherina: Yes, thanks. Mohammed? (Catherina
goes to the phone.) It's me, Catherina. We're
in the hotel, in the lobby. Yes. Immediately (to
her colleagues) There are the elevators, over there.
Let's go on up.

Petro. Fine.

Catherina: Here's his suite.

Mohammed: Catherina! It's so nice to see you.
How are you?

Catherina: Just fine, Mohammed, thanks. And you?

Mohammed: Everything's going just fine for me.
Come on in. It's been years since the last time
we saw each other.

Catherina: Yes. It seems to me it's been at least
five years.

Mohammed: And you. Is everything going okay for
you?

Catherina: Yes, just fine, thanks.

Mohammed: It seems you've brought your entire team
with you.

Catherina: Yes. I'd like to introduce to you Petro,
our engineer.

Petro: Good morning, sir.

Mohammed: Oh, call me Mohammed.

Catherina: And here's Olivero, our accountant ...

Mohammed: Good morning, Olivero.

Catherina: ... and Martijn, who's in charge of
marketing.

Mohammed: Good morning, Martijn. Come on in all
of you and have a seat. (Mohammed calls up Room
Service.) Can you bring us some coffee, please?
Thanks. For five people, please. Thanks a lot.


EXERCISE 4: Renewing old acquaintances.

Guide: Catherina and Mohammed seem to be old friends.
Let's see what old friends say to each other.

First man: Do you see that woman over there?

Second man: Yes.

First man: She looks a lot like Christina.

Second man: Who is she? Christina? She seems
to know you. She's gesturing toward you.

First man: That must be Christina. I'm gonna go
over there to talk to her.

Second man: He's gonna ask her how she is.

First man: Christina, how are you?

Second man: She's gonna say that she's fine.

Christina: I'm fine, and you?

First man: I'm also fine.

Second man: She's gonna say that she hasn't seen
him for a long time.

A woman: We haven't seen each other for a long
time.

First man: Yes. The last time we saw each other
was several years ago.

A woman: Yeah, I think it was three years ago.

Second man: He's gonna correct her.

First man: Oh, much longer than that. I think
that the last time that we saw each other was five
years ago.

Second man: She's gonna express her surprise.

Christina: As long as that?

First man: Oh, yeah. Five years at least, or maybe
even longer than five years.

Second man: He's gonna tell her where they first
met.

First man: We first got to know each other in London.
Do you remember that?

Second man: Now he's gonna introduce me to her.

First man: I'd like to introduce to you Paul, a
friend of mine.

A woman: Good morning, Paul.

Second man: Good morning, Maria.

A woman: I think we know each other. We last saw
each other in Athens about five years ago.

Second man: Yes, that's true. We certainly live
in a small world, don't we.

Guide: Okay. I now want to know how the meeting
went.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENA 5: Geneva, in le suite del senior Chahine:
Martijn explica a Mohammed le multe avantages del
systemas que illes pote offerer a ille. Mohammed
vole saper si le parte administrative del projecto
consumera multo tempore, ma Catherina le assecura
que le quatro de illes pote facer progreder le
projecto multo rapidemente. Martijn adde que illes
pote seliger inter multe optiones pro arrivar al
precios le plus basse.

Mohammed pare imprimite, e ille vole saper quando
illes potera producer un offerta detaliate. Catherina
estima que illes habera besonio de unes octo a dece
septimanas e suggere que illes anque poterea preparar
duo o tres projectos alternative. Illa dice que
pro facer lor travalio illes habera besonio de certe
information, como le costo de combustibile, le natura
del systema de electricitate local, e altere simile
cosas.

Catherina anque dice a Mohammed que illa e su equipa
non vole facer gratis omne iste travalio, e illa
essaya persuader le a dicer si finalmente illes
recipera le contracto. Mohammed responde que ille
ha demandate offertas de tres altere companias e
que le probabilitate que Catherina recipera le
contracto final es bon ma que ille non pote promitter
ullo. Ma a causa de lo que ille ha dicite, Catherina
crede que il ha rationes pro optimismo.

Martijn: Iste systema functiona con electricitate.
Illo es un systema que on ha probate, e nos sape
que illo functiona ben. Naturalmente, illo require
multe spatio. Multe spatio.

Mohammed: Illo non es un problema. Nos ha multe
spatio in le parcella ubi nos va construer iste
citate.

Martijn: Nos ha apprendite multo ex le errores
del prime installationes de iste systema in Europa
e in Nord America. E vos habera le avantage de
lo que nos ha apprendite del problemas que illos
nos ha offerite. Vos anque potera planificar vostre
rete de transporto al mesme tempore que vos designa
le plan del citate mesme. Isto assecura que finalmente
vostre systema de transporto essera multo ben integrate
con le altere partes de vostre citate e plenara
su necessitates de transporto etiam plus efficacemente.

Mohammed: Que typo de systema es illo?

Martijn: Illo es un systema de multo alte
technologia. Illo es multo rapide, e multo efficace.
Ma, naturalmente, su installation mesme essera assatis
car. Illo es magnetic.

Mohammed: E vos pote nos fornir omne iste systemas?

Martijn: Si. Nos pote vos los fornir multo
rapidemente. Nos pote usar le servicios de cinque
o sex del melior companias del mundo. E naturalmente,
nos pote proponer altere solutiones differente.

Mohammed: E esque il habera problemas con demoras
admnistrative?

Catherina: Oh, no, de nulle maniera. Como vos
pote vider, il ha solmente quatro personas in nostre
equipa administrative. Illo tunc es multo mobile
e pote facer omne multo rapidemente.

Mohammed: Illo pare esser un multo bon systema.

Martijn: E como nos pote seliger inter multe optiones,
nostre precios es multo competitive. Nos cerca
le precios le plus avantagiose, e nos passa le
beneficios de iste precios basse a nostre clientes.

Mohammed: Bon. Que nos vade nunc al question le
plus crucial: Quando potera vos inviar a me un offerta
detaliate?

Catherina: Vos dispone de quante tempore?

Mohammed: Inter octo e dece septimanas.

Catherina: Io crede que nos pote facer le travalios
necesse in iste periodo de tempore. Ma nos habera
besonio de un idea de vostre budget pro iste projecto.

Mohammed: Naturalmente nos vole fundar iste projecto
le plus economicamente possibile. Io non pote dar
a vos un quantitate exacte in iste momento.

Catherina: Nos poterea tunc dar a vos un description
general de duo o tres solutiones.

Mohammed: Si, illo esserea perfecte.

Catherina: Ben. Pro iste projecto nos anque ha
besonio del costos de combustibile, le typo de
installation electric que vos ha, e altere simile
informationes sur vostre infrastructura.

Mohammed: Multo ben.

Catherina: E, naturalmente, nos anque habera besonio
de vostre costos de labor local.

Mohammed: Si. Io jam ha apportate hic ille
informtion.

Catherina: Ben. E postea, Mohammed, ...

Mohammed: Si?

Catherina: Francamente, nos non volera facer tante
travalio durante octo septimanas gratis.

Mohammed: Si, io comprende.

Catherina: In vostre opinion, esque nos ha un bon
probabilitate de obtener iste contracto?

Mohammed: Naturalmente, io non pote dicer a vos
si o non in iste momento. Ma io ha demandate que
tres companias prepara offertas differente. Io
crede que vostre probabilitates es bon. Ma io
simplemente non pote vos promitter ullo ante haber
vidite voste offertas detaliate.

Catherina: Io comprende, si.

Mohammed: E nos non pote pagar le costos del travalio
de preparation de un offerta, si illo es lo que
vos me demanda.

Catherina: Io comprende.

Mohammed: Ma inter vos e me, io non pensa que le
altere companias pote offerer le servicios que vos
nos offere, ma io non pote dar a vos un responsa
definite ante vider vostre offertas.

Catherina: Lo que vos ha dicite, naturalmente,
io trova assatis incoragiante.


EXERCITIO 5: Discussion de periodos de tempore
pro completar projectos.

Guida: Durante le reunion inter Mohammed e le equipa
de Catherina, illes ha discutite problemas de periodos
de tempore pro completar projectos. Il ha unes
expressiones que illes ha usate que pare multo utile.

Un femina: Illes vole un prototypo.

Un homine: Quando? Quando lo vole illes?

Un femina: Le data de limite es le fin de junio.

Un homine: Illo nos lassa quante tempore?

Un femina: Unes sex septimanas.

Un homine: Sex septimanas. Io crede que nos habera
besonio de plus que sex septimanas.

Un femina: Quante tempore tunc? Vos habera besonio
de quante tempore?

Un homine: Il essera necesse que nos lo fabrica.

Un femina: Quante tempore? Quante tempore essera
necesse pro fabricar lo?

Un homine: Duo o tres septimanas. Nos tunc debera
assecurar nos que illo functiona ben.

Un femina: Quante tempore essera necesse pro illo?

Un homine: Plus o minus un altere septimana. Tunc
nos debera transportar lo.

Un femina: Quante tempore essera necesse pro
transportar lo?

Un homine: Oh, duo septimanas, plus o minus.

Un femina: Multo ben. Il essera un question de
six septimas pro omne le projecto.

Un homine: Si, ma solmente si omne vade ben. On
non pote esser completemente confidente que le projecto
essera finite intra sex septimanas.

Un femina: Quante tempore, tunc? Quanto tempore
crede vos que vos debe reservar pro iste projecto?

Un homine: Io crede que il esserea plus prudente
reservar octo septimanas.

Un femina: Octo septimanas. Multo ben. Ma nos
debera completar omne iste projecto in octo septimanas
sin falta.

Un homine: Io facera omne lo que io pote facer
pro assecurar illo.

Guida: Le negotiationes con le senior Chahine ha
progredite ben. Io volerea saper si Catherina e
le alteres es tan optimista.


SCENA 6: Geneva, in un automobile e in le officio:
Post le reunion con Mohammed, Catherina, Petro,
e Martijn discute le possibilitates de obtener le
contracto. Catherina es optimistic e crede que
si omne depende de Mohammed solmente, illes probabile-
mente lo obtenera.

Petro essaya invitar Catherina a dinar con ille,
ma illa responde que il esserea melior non facer
isto proque Petro probabilemente vadera a Mexico.
Petro vole saper si Alan Tanner anque ha habite
un certe influentia sur iste decision, e Catherina
confessa que isto es ver. De facto, Alan telephona
Catherina in le medio de iste conversation, e Catherina
dice que illa vole parlar con ille in su officio.

Post isto, Petro decide que ille definitemente vadera
a Mexico. Catherina essaya continuar lor conversation
post parlar con Alan, ma Petro non coopera, e Catherina
es enoiate. Illa tunc vade via con Martijn pro
comenciar lor travalio sur le projecto egyptian.

Petro: Catherina, esque vos crede que le reunion
vadeva ben?

Catherina: Il me pare que omne vadeva ben.

Petro: Ma usque nunc nos non ha ulle contracto.

Catherina: Si. Vos ha ration. E nos anque non
lo habera ante le fin del estate. Ma io crede que
nos vermente ha impressionate Mohammed con le qualitate
de nostre servicios.

Petro: Illo esseva bon, le prandio.

Catherina: Si. Mohammed es un gourmet.

Petro: Ille pareva multo contente quando nos finiva
le reunion.

Catherina: Si. Io pensa que si ille esseva le
sol persona que facerea le decision, nos haberea
le contracto sin difficultate. Ma mesmo in le
circumstantias existente, io crede que nos ha un
bon probabilitate de finalmente reciper le contracto.

Petro: Catherina, e pro iste vespere, esque vos
crede que il esserea possibile ...

Catherina: Vos parla de sortir a dinar?

Petro: Si, exactemente.

Catherina: Oh no, Petro, que nos non parla plus

Tanner?

Catherina: In parte si. Ma il non es solmente
a causa de Alan.

Petro: Proque dice vos illo?

Catherina: Eh ben, vos va partir a Mexico, e ...

Petro: Que?

Catherina: Eh ben, le cosas esserea differente

Catherina: Io crede que omne vadeva ben. E vos,

Martijn: Vos va a Mexico tunc.

Petro: Si.

Martijn: Si, nos jam credeva illo. Tu jam habeva

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: Geneva, in Mr. Chahine's suite: Martijn
explains to Mohammed the many advantages of the
systems that they can offer him. Mohammed wants
to know if the administrative part of the project
will take up a lot of time, but Catherina assures
him that the four of them can keep the project going
very rapidly. Martijn adds that they can select
among many options to arrive at the lowest prices.

Mohammed seems impressed, and he wants to know when
they will be able to come up with a detailed offer.
Catherina estimates that they will need from about
eight to ten weeks and suggests that they could
also prepare two or three alternative projects.
She says that to do their work they will need certain
information, such as the cost of fuel, the kind
of local electricity system they have, and other
similar things.

Catherina also tells Mohammed that she and her team
don't want to do all this work for nothing, and
she tries to persuade him to say if they will finally
get the contract. Mohammed answers that he has
asked for offers from three other companies and
that the probability that Catherine will get the
final contract is good but that he can't promise
anything. But because of what he has said, Catherina
believes that there are reasons for optimism.

Martijn: This system works with electricity. It
is a system that has been tested, and we know that
it works well. Naturally, it requires a lot of
space. A lot of space.

Mohammed: That's not a problem. We've got a lot
of space in the parcel where we're gonna build this
city.

Martijn: We have learned a lot from the mistakes
made in the installations of the first version of
this system in Europe and North America. And you
will have the advantage of what we have learned
from the problems they have caused us. You also
will be able to plan your transport network at the
same time that you design the plan for the city
itself. This makes sure that finally your transport
system will be very well integrated with the other
parts of your city and will fulfill your transport
needs even more effectively.

Mohammed: What kind of system is it?

Martijn: It is a very high-tech system. It is
very rapid and efficient. But naturally installing
it is rather expensive. It is magnetic.

Mohammed: And you can furnish us all these systems?

Martijn: Yes. We can furnish them very rapidly.
We can use the services of five or six of the best
companies in the world. And naturally, we can propose
other different solutions.

Mohammed: And will there be problems with
administrative delays?

Catherina: Oh, no, no way. As you can see, there
are only four people on our administrative team.
It is thus very mobile and can do everything very
rapidly.

Mohammed: It seems to be a very good system.

Martijn: And since we can select among many options,
our prices are very competitive. We look for the
most advantageous prices, and we pass the benefits
of these low prices on to our customers.

Mohammed: Fine. Let's go on now to the most crucial
question: When can you send me a detailed offer?

Catherina: How much time do you have?

Mohammed: Between eight and ten weeks.

Catherina: I think that we can do the necessary
work in this period of time. But we will need an
idea of your budget for this project.

Mohammed: Naturally we will want to fund this
project in the most cost effective way possible.
I can't give you an exact amount at this moment.

Catherina: We could then give you a general
description of two or three solutions.

Mohammed: Yes, that would be perfect.

Catherina: Fine. For this project we also need
fuel costs, the kind of electrical installation
that you have, and other similar information on
your infrastructure.

Mohammed. Fine.

Catherina: And, naturally, we will also need your
local labor costs.

Mohammed: Yes. I have already brought that
information here.

Catherina: Fine. And afterwards, Mohammed, ...

Mohammed: Yes?

Catherina: Frankly, we don't want to do so much
work for eight weeks without getting paid.

Mohammed: Yes, I understand.

Catherina: In your opinion, do we have a good chance
of landing this contract?

Mohammed: Naturally, I can't tell you yes or no
at this moment. But I have asked three other companies
to prepare different offers. I think that your
chances are good. But I simply can't promise you
anything before seeing your detailed proposals.

Catherina: I understand, yes.

Mohammed: And we can't pay you for the costs of
preparing an offer, if that is what you are asking.

Catherina: I understand.

Mohammed: But between you and me, I don't think
that the other companies can offer the services
that you are offering us, but I can't give you a
definite response before seeing your proposals.

Catherina: What you have said, naturally, I find
rather encouraging.


EXERCISE 5: Discussion of time periods for finishing
projects:

Guide: During the meeting between Mohammed and
Catherina's team, there was a discussion of time
periods for finishing projects. There are some
expressions they used that seem very useful.

A woman: They want a prototype.

A man: When? When do they want it?

A woman: The deadline is the end of June.

A man: That leaves us with how much time?

A woman: Some six weeks.

A man: Six weeks. I think that we will need more
than six weeks.

A woman: How much time then? How much time will
you need?

A man: We will have to manufacture it.

A woman: How much time? How much time will be
needed to manufacture it?

A man: Two or three weeks. We then will have to
make sure it works well.

A woman: How much time will be needed for that?

A man: Another week, more or less. Then we will
have to transport it.

A woman: How much time will be needed to transport
it?

A man: Oh, two weeks, more or less.

A woman: Very well. Then six weeks will be needed
for the entire project.

A man: Yes, but only if everything goes well.
You can't be completely confident that the project
will be finished within six weeks.

A woman: How much time, then? How much time do
you think that we should put aside for this project?

A man: I think that it would be safer to put aside
eight weeks.

A woman: Eight weeks. Very well. But we will
have to finish all this project in eight weeks with
no excuses.

A man: I will do everything I can to make sure
of that.

Guide: The negotions with Mr. Chahine have gone
well. I would like to know if Catherina and the
others are as optimistic.


SCENE 6: Geneva, in a car and in the office: After
the meeting with Mohammed, Catherina, Petro, and
Martijn discuss the possibilities of getting the
contract. Catherina is optimistic and thinks that
if everything depended on Mohammed alone, they
would probably get it.

Petro tries to invite Catherina to go out to eat
dinner with him, but she responds that it would
be better not to do this because Petro probabily
will be going to Mexico. Petro wants to know if
Alan Tanner also has had a certain influence on
this decision, and Catherina confesses that this
is true. As a matter of fact, Alan calls Catherina
up in the middle of this conversation, and Catherina
says that she wants to talk to him in her office.

After this, Petro decides that he definitely will
go to Mexico. Catherina tries to continue their
conversation after talking with Alan, but Petro
does not cooperate, and Catherina is annoyed. She
then goes away with Martijn to start their work
on the Egyptian project.

Petro: Catherina, do you think the meeting went
well?

Catherina: It seems to me that everything went
well.

Petro: But up to now, we don't have a contract.

Catherina: Yes, you're right. And we also will
not have it before the end of summer. But I think
that we have really impressed Mohammed with the
quality of our services.

Petro: The lunch at least was good.

Catherina: Yes. Mohammed is a gourmet.

Petro: He seemed very happy when we finished the
meeting.

Catherina: Yes. I think that if it were up to
him alone, we would have the contract with no trouble
at all. But even with things as they are, I think
we have a good chance of finally landing it.

Petro: Catherina, and this evening, do you think
it would be possible ...

Catherina: You're talking about going out to dinner?

Petro: Yes, exactly.

Catherina: Oh, no, Petro, let's not say anything
further about that.

Petro: Why not? Is it because of Alan Tanner?

Catherina: Partly, yes. But it's not only because
of Alan.

Petro: Why do you say that?

Catherina: Well, you're gonna go to Mexico, and ...

Petro: What?

Catherina: Okay. Things would be different if
you stayed here in Geneva. But since you have decided
to go to Mexico to work ...

Peter: But ...

Martijn: (Entering the office) Ah, how's everything?
And the meeting, what do you think of the
possibilities?

Catherina: I think everything went well. And you,
Martin, what do you think of it?

Martijn: Oh, I also found it very encouraging,
especially when he said to you &quot;Between us, I think
that your chances are good.&quot; And the lunch. It
was fantastic.

Petro: Catherina, for me things have changed.

Catherina: What has changed?

Petro: Everything.

Catherina: Oh yeah? Why?

Petro: You know, I wanted to leave Geneva to go ...

(The phone rings.)

Martijn: Hello? Yes, yes. Sbe's here. Catherina,
it's for you. Mr. Tanner is on the line.

Catherina: Alan?

Petro: But Catherina!

Catherina: Hello, Alan? Yes. I'm going with you.
Wait a minute. I'm in the reception area of our
offices. I'm gonna go to my office. I want to
talk with you there. Martijn, can you connect Alan
with the phone in my office?

Martijn: Hello? She's now in her office. I'm
gonna connect you with her. Stay on the line.
Catherina, you have him on your line.

Petro: Good. I now know what I'm gonna do.

Martijn: And what is that?

Petro: I was right. Geneva is not really a good
place for me.

Martijn: You're going to Mexico then.

Petro: Yes.

Martijn: Yes, we already thought so. You made
the decision already a week or two ago.

Petro: No, not really. To tell the truth, I made
this decision only five minutes ago.

Martijn: Have you signed the papers yet?

Petro: No, but I'm gonna do so immediately.

Catherina: (Returning from her office) Thanks,
Martijn.

Petro: That didn't last very long.

Catherina: What do you mean, Petro?

Petro: About what?

Catherina: You were talking about certain things
that had changed.

Petro: No, no. Nothing. Nothing has changed.

Catherina: Petro, you are really the most exasperating
man that I have ever met.

Petro: You're much too nice!

Catherina: Come with me, Martijn. Let's start
our work on the offering.

Martijn: With pleasure, boss.

Guide: It seems to me that Petro is too proud.
He may run into some fairly difficult problems.
But sometimes there are days when things don't work
out the way they should.

EXERCITIO 2: Dar instructiones:

Guida: Il jam ha habite problemas con le equipa
de Paris. Sin dubita, il non es facile organisar
un reunion. In iste scena Petro dava unes
instructiones a Francesca. Io mesme volerea audir
un altere sequentia de instructiones:

A woman: Io ha un problema. Le cravata de mi chef
es prendite in le photocopiator. Que va io facer?

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 1: The offices of Geneva: Peter dictates
to his secretary a letter to Mr. Floret in Paris
in which he reveals his intention to stay in Geneva
and expresses his hope that Floret will be able
to intervene in his favor

Petro: The first letter goes to Transportes de
Mexico. You will find the address in the file.
The date is today's. Dear Patricio, comma, new
line. Thank you for your letter, period. After
having reflected a long time, comma, I have decided
to stay in Geneva, period. No that's not gonna
work. The first letter goes to Marex Mundial, Paris,
to Mr. G. Floret, ef, el, oh, are, ee, tea. The
address, etc., are in the file. Dear Gerardo, I
am writing you because of a problem I have that
is a bit delicate. For several reasons, I wanted
to leave Geneva, comma, and now I want to reverse
this decision, period. New line. Would it be possible
for you to help me and use your good offices in
my favor, question mark. Giving you my thanks in
advance, I want to extend you, etc., etc., etc.
Use yesterday's date. Very well. That's all for
now.


SCENE 2: The Geneva offices: Francesca wants to
talk to Petro about the first commission meeting.
There is a new problem because the meeting will
take place on the third day of the month, but the
Paris office says that it will be impossible to
send out their senior engineer before the fourth
day of the month. Petro gets angry and wants to
know who Francesca talked to, but she doesn't know
this. Petro then tells her to call up Paris and
talk with Mr. Dumont in person (and no other person
who works in the Paris office) and to tell him that
he will have to be in Geneva on the third of the
month without fail.

Petro: Good morning, Francesca.

Francesca: Good morning, Petro. Can I talk with
you?

Petro: Yes, of course.

Francesca: There's a problem with the first meeting
of the commission.

Petro: The technical liaison commission?

Francesca: The meeting will take place the third
day of the month, won't it?

Petro: Yes, exactly. Is everything ready?

Francesca: Yes, but there is one problem with the
engineer in Paris, Mr. Dumont. He won't be able
to be here on the third, and he's gonna arrive on
the fourth.

Petro: Who told you that?

Francesca: Someone called me from Paris. I don't
know exactly who.

Petro: But we can't have the meeting without him.
It is absolutely necessary for everyone to be there.
It is, after all, a liaison meeting.

Francesca: Yes, I know that, but he says that he
can't come before the fourth.

Petro: You didn't talk to Dumont in person?

Francesca: No. He wasn't the person who called
but someone else in the Paris office.

Petro: Fine. Here's what you're gonna do. Call
up Paris and ask to talk with Dumont personally.
Don't talk to anyone else. We want only the senior
engineer, no other person. Contact Dumont and tell
him that we will be having the meeting on the third
of the month.

Francesca: Okay.

Petro: If there's any problem, tell me, and I'll
call Paris up myself.

Francesca: Fine. I'll do that immediately.


EXERCISE 2: Giving instructions:

Guide: There have already been problems with the
Paris team. Wtihout doubt, it isn't easy to organize
a meeting. In this scene Petro gave some instructions
to Francesca. I myself would like to hear another
sequence of instructions:

A woman (talking on the phone: I have a problem.
My boss's tie is caught in the photocopier. What
am I gonna do?

A man: Try to relax now. Don't worry. Is your
boss with you right now?

A woman: Yes.

A man: What kind of machine is it?

A woman: A B-60.

A man: Good. First, tell him to calm down and
relax.

A woman: Calm down and relax.

A man: Tell him that he should not pull on his
tie.

A woman: Don't pull on your tie.

A man: Fine. Tell him that he should disconnect
the electricity.

A woman: Disconnect the electricity.

A man: Now, tell him that he should open up the
cover.

A woman: Open up the cover.

A man: Tell him that he should push the left button.

A woman: Push the left button.

A man: Tell him that he now should lift up the
main platen.

A woman: Lift up the main platen.

A man: Tell him not to let it fall down.

A woman: Don't let it fall down.

A man: Tell him that he should now turn the other
platen.

A woman: Now, turn the other platen.

A man: Is the gear train now disengaged?

A woman: Yes, it is disengaged.

A man: Can he remove his tie now?

A woman: Yes, he's now taken it out.

A man: Good. Tell him that he now should put the
main platen back into the machine, close the cover,
and reconnect the electricity.

A woman: Now put the main platen back into the
machine, close the cover, and reconnect the
electricity.

A man: And tell him also that he should not wear
a tie when he is close to that machine.

SCENA 3: Le officios de Geneva: Post telephonar
Paris, Francesca dice a Petro que le senior Dumont
va esser in Geneva le tertie die del mense in vice
del quarte. Petro da le gratias a Francesca e la
felicita pro haber persuadite Dumont a venir a tempore
pro le reunion.

Francesca tunc demanda a Petro si ille vermente
va vader a Mexico. Petro confirma que forsan ille
vadera illac, e Francesca vole saper proque ille
non appare plus felice con le prospecto de un nove
position. Postea illa suggere a Petro que forsan
ille debe parlar a Catherina si ille vole remaner
in Geneva.

In iste momento Catherina entra. Illa vole parlar
con Petro, qui anque dice que ille vole parlar con
illa. Francesca vade via, e Catherina explica a
Petro un pauco sur le natura de su relationes con
Alan. Il pare que omne es finite inter illes, e
Petro dice a Catherina que ille nunc non vole vader
a Mexico. Ben que Catherina personalmente volerea
que Petro remane in Geneva, illa jam ha contractate
un nove ingeniero pro su position in Geneva. Petro,
naturalmente, es disappunctate.

Francesca: Petro?

Petro: Ah, Francesca, entra.

Francesca: Io ha parlate al senior Dumont in Paris.

Petro: Multo ben. Que diceva ille?

Francesca: Ille venira.

Petro: Le die tertie?

Francesca: Ille diceva que illo essera difficile,
ma ille venira.

Petro: Ben. Gratias pro facer isto. Vos ha facite
un bon travalio. On debe esser firme con iste
ingenieros.

Francesca: Excusa me, ma io ha audite que tosto
vos vadera a Mexico.

Petro: Io habeva ille intention, si.

Francesca: Vos non es contente con vostre decision?

Petro: Vermente no.

Francesca: Io sape que illo non es un affaire mie,
ma proque vole vos vader ex Geneva?

Petro: Vermente, io non sape. Ante dece cinque
dies, io pensava que illo esserea un bon idea.

Francesca: Ma non pote vos cambiar vostre decision?
Vos poterea parlar de illo con Catherina. Io es
confidente que illa prefererea que vos remaneva hic.

Petro: Si, io poterea parlar con illa.

Francesca: Ma proque non lo face vos tunc?

Petro: Il ha plus que illo.

Francesca: De que parla vos?

Petro: Eh ben, io non es completemente confidente
que io ha obtenite iste position in Mexico.

Francesca: Ah si?

Petro: Si. Nullo ha essite finalisate. Io non
ha ulle contracto. Il es possibile que illes dara
le position a un altere persona.

Francesca: Ascolta, il me pare que le melior cosa
a facer es parlar con Catherina ante que il es troppo
tarde. Dice a illa que vos nunc vole continuar
vostre travalio hic.

(Il ha un colpo sur le porta.)

Petro: Entra.

Catherina: Bon die, Petro.

Petro: Esque vos ha un minuta?

Catherina: Si. Que vole vos?

Petro: Eh ben, il es un pauco difficile.

Francesca: Bon. Io debe retornar a mi travalio.
A revider.

Petro: A revider.

Catherina: De que voleva vos parlar?

Petro: Como va Alan?

Catherina: Alan?

Petro: Si.

Catherina: Eh ben, io crede que le cosas va assatis
ben. Proque me demanda vos illo? Vos vole saper
como es le cosas inter Alan e me?

Petro: Si, illo es lo que io voleva saper.

Catherina: Omne es finite inter nos. Quando io
esseva in mi officio parlante con ille, io le diceva
illo.

Petro: Ah si.

Catherina: E ... vos voleva parlar con me solmente
sur illo?

Petro: Vermente no. Io vole parlar sur un altere
cosa: Io vole remaner a Geneva. Io vole continuar
mi travalio hic.

Catherina: Io comprende. Io personalmente volerea
multo que vos remane hic, ma il ha un problema.

Petro: Que es illo?

Catherina: Io ha trovate un altere ingeniero pro
vostre position. Ille va comenciar lunedi, de maniera
que vos pote orientar le al officio e a vostre
travalio.

Petro: Si, io comprende. Omne es decidite tunc?

Catherina: Si, e il esserea multo difficile cambiar
iste situation.

Petro: Quando venira le nove ingeniero lunedi?

Catherina: In le matino. Io pensava que vos e
ille poterea vader al reunion del commission. Vos
sape lo que se passa, e vos potera orientar le al
projecto egyptian.

Petro: Si. Ubi travalia ille in iste momento.

Catherina: In Paris.

Petro: Qui es ille?

Catherina: Vos jam le cognosce.

Petro: Ah si?

Catherina: Si. Vos e ille vos cognosceva un vice
in le avion que vos apportava a Geneva. Le secunde
vice vos le videva in Paris. Io ha audite que vos
non esseva multo cortese con ille.

Petro: Que?

Catherina: Si, ille es John Melville.

Petro: Ma vos non pote travaliar con un homine
como ille. Illo non es possibile.

Catherina: Proque non? Ille es multo ben
qualificate. Ille cognosce multo ben le mestiero.
Ille ha multe experientia.

Petro: No, ille simplemente non debe travaliar
hic.

Catherina: Il non ha multo que on pote facer pro
prevenir lo.

Petro: Ma il debe haber alique maniera de remediar
isto nonobstante.

Petro: Bon.

Melville: Nos va esser professional?

Petro: Professional, si.

Melville: Io volerea simplemente assister al reunion
como observator. Vos comprende? A iste puncto io
vole solmente orientar me un pauco a lo que se face.
Vos pote facer lo que vos vole, naturalmente.

Petro: Multo ben.

Melville: De omne manieras, io crede que io non
va comprender ullo.

Petro: Proque?

Melville: Illo essera troppo technic pro me.

Petro: Ma vos es un ingeniero.

Melville: Si, ma io recipeva mi diplomas ante multe
tempore e le technologia ha cambiate. Omne nunc
es completemente differente.

Petro: Melville, io volerea saper un cosa: Proque
vole vos iste position?

Melville: Illo es un question amusante.

Petro: No, io parla seriosemente. Illo non es
un travalio que conveni a vos.

Melville: Oh, al contrario. Io crede que il es
un travalio ideal pro me.

Petro: Ma, post le position que vos habeva antea?

Melville: Io habeva mi rationes pro volar quitar
lo.

Petro: E io, io vole restar hic.

Melville: Vermente?

Petro: Si, io vole restar a Geneva. Io non vole
un travalio nove.

Melville: Eh ben, io lo regretta multissimo, ma
il es un pauco tarde. Io nunc ha un contracto.
Forsan il ha un altere position pro vos in iste
officio?

Petro: Ma vos sape multo ben que iste position
non vos conveni. Proque non vole vole retornar
a vostre vetule position?

Melville: Reguarda, io regretta que io nunc ha
vostre position, ma io simplemente non vole retornar
a mi vetule position.

Petro: Proque?

Melville: Io non vole discuter illo. Io ha un
contracto, e io vole remaner hic. Esque vos nunc
pote monstrar me le programma pro iste postmeridie?
Io volera studiar lo un pauco ante le reunion pro
non parer un imbecille durante que illo progrede.


EXERCITIO 4: Questiones e responsas (si/non).

Guida: Oh, le cosas non pare vader multo ben pro
Petro in iste momento! Ma ille mesme ha un pauco
de responsabilitate pro su proprie problemas. Io
nunc volerea audir un pauco sur le formation de
questiones al quales on pote responder con si o
non e le diverse manieras de responder a illos:

Un femina: Vos vole vader nunc a London?

Un homine: Si, io va le septimana proxime.

Un femina: Esque vos ha comprate vostre billet
de avion?

Un homine: Non io va comprar lo iste postmeridie.

Un femina: Vos jam ha vadite a London, nonne?

Un homine: Si, io vadeva illac diverse vices ante
multe tempore.

Un femina: Vostre femina vadera con vos?

Un homine: No, illo es un viage de affaires.

Un femina: E le Statos Unite, non vade vos illac
iste anno?

Un homine: Si, sin dubita io vade illac in autumno.

Un femina: E vos vadera illac con vostre femina?

Un homine: Si, iste vice illa vadera con me. Nos
essera in New York dece cinque dies.

Guida: Multo ben. Que nos nunc vide lo que Petro
nunc face.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 3: The Geneva offices: After calling up
Paris, Fancesca tells Petro that Mr. Dumont is going
to be in Geneva on the third day of the month instead
of the fourth. Petro thanks Francesca and
congratulates her for having persuaded Dumont to
come on time for the meeting.

Francesca then asks Petro if he is really going
to go to Mexico. Petro confirms that he will possibly
go there, and Francesca wants to know why he doesn't
seem to be happier with the prospect of a new job.
Afterward she suggests to Petro that maybe he should
talk to Catherina if he wants to stay in Geneva.

At this moment Catherina comes in. She wants to
talk with Petro, who also says that he wants to
talk to her. Francesca leaves, and Catherina explains
to Petro a little about the nature of her relationship
with Alan. It seems that everything is over between
them, and Petro says to Catherina that he now doesn't
want to go to Mexico. Even though Catherina personally
would prefer that Peter remain in Geneva, she has
already hired a new engineer for his position in Geneva.
Peter, naturally, is disappointed.

Francesca: Petro?

Petro: Ah, Francesca, come on in.

Francesca: I've talked with Mr. Dumont in Paris.

Petro: Fine. What did he say?

Francesca: He'll be coming.

Petro: On the third?

Francesca: He said that it will be difficult, but
he'll come.

Petro: Fine. Thanks for doing this. You did a
good job. You have to be firm with those engineers.

Francesca: Excuse me, but I have heard that soon
you're gonna go to Mexico.

Petro: I had that intention, yes.

Francesca: Are you happy with your decision?

Petro: No, not really.

Francesca: I know that it is none of my business,
but why do you want to leave Geneva?

Petro: Really, I don't know. Fifteen days ago,
I thought it would be a good idea.

Francesca: But can't you change your decision?
You could talk about it with Catherina. I'm sure
she would like you to stay here.

Petro: Yeah, I could talk with her.

Francesca: So why don't you do so?

Petro: There's more involved than that.

Francesca: What are you talking about?

Petro: Well, I'm not completely sure that I have
secured this position in Mexico.

Francesca: Oh yeah?

Petro: Yeah. Nothing's been finalized. I don't
have any contract. It's possible that they will
give the job to someone else.

Francesca: Listen, it seems to me that the best
thing to do is talk with Catherina before it's too
late. Tell her that you now want to go on working
here.

(There's a knock on the door.)

Petro: Come in.

Catherina: Good morning, Petro.

Petro: Do you have a minute?

Catherina: Yes. What do you want?

Petro: Well, it's a little difficult.

Francesca: Fine. I'd better go back to my work.
See you.

Petro: See you.

Catherina: What did you want to talk about?

Petro: How're things with Alan?

Catherina: Alan?

Petro: Yes.

Catherina: Okay. I think that things are going
well enough. Why are you asking me that? Do you
want to know how things are going between Alan and
me?

Petro: Yes, that's what I wanted to know.

Catherina: Everything's finished between us. When
I was in my office talking with him, I told him
that.

Petro: Ah yes.

Catherina: And ... you wanted to talk with me about
that?

Petro: Really, no. I wanted to talk about something
else: I want to stay in Geneva. I want to continue
my work here.

Catherina: I understand. I personally would really
like for you to stay here, but there's a problem.

Petro: What is it?

Catherina: I've found another engineer for your
position. He's gonna start Monday so that you can
orient him to your office and to your work.

Petro: Yes, I understand. Everything is decided
then?

Catherina: Yes, and it would be very hard to change
this situation.

Petro: When will the new engineer be coming Monday?

Catherina: In the morning. I thought that you
and he could go to the commission meeting. You
know what is going on, and you will be able to orient
him to the Egyptian project.

Petro: Yes. Where's he working right now?

Catherina: In Paris.

Petro: Who is he.

Catherina: You already know him.

Petro: Oh, yeah?

Catherina: Yes. You and he got to know each other
in the plane that you took to Geneva. The second
time you saw him in Paris. I heard that you weren't
all that nice to him.

Petro: What?

Catherina: Yes, It's John Melville.

Petro: But you can't work with a man like him.
That's not possible.

Catherina: Why not? He is very well qualified.
He knows the field well. He has a lot of experience.

Petro: No, he simply should not work here.

Catherina: There's not much that can be done to
prevent it.

Petro: But there must be something that can be
done about this somehow.


EXERCISE 3: Listening and understanding.

Guide: So it seems that Petro is going to run once
again into his good friend, Mr. Melville. I would
certainly like to know how they are going to treat
each other. But now, here's an oral Interlingua
exercise:

A woman: I've just now received this message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.
It seems that she works half time in marketing Service
and that a coworker said that this apartment will
soon be available. In any case, Mrs. Moreau is
looking for a new apartment not far from the downtown
area of the city. And since she was told that
Mr. Arnez is going to leave the country, she would
like to take a look at his apartment, if it is
available.

A man: Describe to me the message that you have
received in smaller parts, and I'll repeat it to
you.

A woman: I've just now received a message.

A man: You've just now received a message.

A woman: This message is for Mr. David Arnez.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez. Who does this message come from?

A woman: This message comes from Gisele Moreau.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau.

A woman: Gisele Moreau heard that he is going to
leave his apartment.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.

A woman: It seems that she works half time.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.
It seems that she works half time. Where does she
work?

A woman: She works in marketing Service.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.
It seems that she works half time in marketing service.

A woman: A coworker said that soon this apartment
will be available.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.
It seems that she works half time in marketing service
and that a coworker said that soon this apartment
will be available.

A woman: In any case, Mrs. Moreau is looking for
a new apartment. This apartment should be not far
from the downtown area of the city.

A man: You've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.

and that a coworker said that soon this apartment
will be available. In any case, Mrs. Moreau is
looking for a new apartment, which should not be
far from the downtown area of the city.

A woman: Someone said to her that Mr. Arnez is
going to leave the country, and she would like to
take a look at his apartment, if it is available.

A man: So you've just now received a message for
Mr. David Arnez, which comes from Gisele Moreau,
who heard that he is going to leave his apartment.
It seems that she works half time in marketing service
and that a coworker said that soon this apartment
will be available. In any case, Mrs. Moreau is
looking for a new apartment, which should not be
far from the downtown area of the city. And since
someone told her that Mr. Arnez is going to leave
the country, she would like to take a look at the
apartment if it is available. Have I repeated all
the message?

A woman: Yes, you've repeated all of it. Your
memory is very good. You would be a good actor.


SCENE 4: The Geneva offices: Catherina reintroduces
Petro to John Melville and goes away for a few
mintues. Petro and John reassure each other that
they they are going to treat each other
professionally. Mr. Melville explains to Petro
that he wants to participate in the meeting as an
observer.

Petro then asks Melville why he left his last job
for this one and tries to persuade him that this
new position is not suitable for him. Mr. Melville,
however, insists that this new position is perfect
for him at this moment.

Catherina: Mr. Melville, Mr. Minelli. I believe
that you already know each other.

Petro: Yes. We got to know each other once or
twice.

Melville: Yes, that's true.

Catherina: What time does our commission meeting
start?

Petro: At two.

Catherina: Fine. I'm gonna let the two of you
talk.

Melville: See you later Catherina.

Petro: Okay.

Melville: Are we going to be professional?

Petro: Professional, yes.

Melville: I would simply like to go to the meeting
as an observer. You understand? At this point
I would like to orient myself a little to what is
happening. You can do what you want, naturlly.

Petro: Fine.

Melville: In any event, I don't think I'm going
to understand anything.

Petro: Why?

Melville: It will be too technical for me.

Petro: But you're an engineer.

Melville: Yes, but I received my diplomas many
years ago, and the technology has changed. Everything
now is completely different.

Petro: Melville, I'd like to know one thing: Why
do you want this position?

Melville: That's a funny question.

Petro: No, I'm speaking seriously. This is not
a job that is suitable for you.

Melville: Oh, on the contrary. I think that it
is an ideal job for me.

Peter: But after the job you had before?

Melville: I had my reasons for wanting to leave
it.

Petro: And me, I want to stay here.

Melville: Really?

Petro: Yes, I want to stay in Geneva. I don't
want a new job.

Melville: Okay, I'm very sorry, but it's a little
late. I now have a contract. Perhaps there's another
job for you in this office?

Petro: But you know very well that this job is
not suitable for you. Why don't you want to go
back to your old job?

Melville: Look, I'm sorry that I now have your
job, but I simply don't want to return to my old
one.

Petro: Why?

Melville: I don't want to discuss that. I have
a contract, and I want to stay here. Can you now
show me the program for this afternoon? I want
to study it a little before the meeting so I won't
seem stupid while it goes on.


EXERCISE 4: Questions and answers (yes/no).

Guide: Oh, things don't seem to be going very well
for Peter right now! But he has himself to blame
somewhat for his own problems. I now want to hear
a little about the formation of yes/no questions
and the ways they can be answered.

A woman: Do you want to go to London now?

A man: Yes, I'm going next week.

A woman: Have you bought your plane ticket?

A man: No, I'm gonna buy it this afternoon.

A woman: You've already gone to London, haven't
you?

A man: Yes, I went there several times a long time
ago.

A woman: Is your wife gonna go with you?

A man: No, this is a business trip.

A woman: And the United States, aren't you going
there this year?

A man: Yes, no doubt I'll go there this fall.

A woman: Are you gonna go there with your wife?

A man: Yes, this time she will go with me. We
will spend fifteen days in New York.

Guide: Fine. Let's now take a look at what Petro
is doing right now.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SCENE 5: The Geneva offices: Petro and John Melville
are talking after the meeting. Mr. Melville was
very impressed with the professionalism of all the
participants in the meeting.

Petro calls up Francesca to find out if there are
any messages for him. Francesca reads him a letter
from Transportes Mexico. It says that Petro is
exactly the person that they need, and they are
ready to hire him without further interviews. This
surprises Petro because he had dictated a letter
to them indicating that he did not want the job.

Transportes Mexico says that he will have to pass
a medical examination before settling into his new
position, but the company assures him that this
will probably be only a formality. Francesca then
reads a telex to him. It comes from Alicia, who
finally understands that Petro does not want her
as his secretary. This news, naturally, is a great
relief for Petro.

Finally, Francesca says that she has found in his
desk a letter of his to Mexico. Naturally, this
is good news for Petro. Probably he forgot to drop
this letter into the mail. Petro now understands
why Transportes Mexico has offered him his new
engineering job. Finally, he returns to the meeting
with Mr. Melville.

Melville: They really know their work well, those
people.

Petro: That's normal. They are the best in their
specialty.

Melville: Yes, really.

Petro: Listen, will you excuse me. I want to call
up Francesca to verify something.

Melville: Yes, naturally.

Petro: Hello, Francesca?

Francesca: Yes.

Petro: It's me, Petro.

Francesca: Good morning, Petro.

Petro: Listen. Is there a message for me? A letter,
something similar?

Francesca: Yes, there is a telex, and also a letter.

Petro: Where is the letter from?

Francesca: It's from ... Mexico.

Petro: Really? Can you open it up and read me it?

Francesca: Yes, just a moment. It's from Transportes
Mexico. Do you want me to read all of it to you?

Petro: Yes, please.

Francesca: Very well: &quot;Dear Mr. Minelli, we have
the pleasure of informing you that you are exactly
the persona that we need.&quot;

Petro: Oh God, I sent them a letter saying that
I was gonna remain here in Geneva?

Melville: A bad piece of news?

Petro: Yes, in a sense.

Francesca: Pardon?

Petro: Nothing, nothing.

Francesca: Do you want me to continue?

Petro: Yes, please.

Francesca: &quot;We have heard so many good things about
you that it does not seem necessary for us to interview
you. We want to include you among our personnel
immediately, if this is possible. The only
precondition, which certainly will seem normal to
you, is for our medical service to assure us, after
an examination, that you health is in a satisfactory
condition. We are convinced that this wil be a
simple formality. Awaiting the pleasure of receiving
a response from you ... &quot;

Petro: Yes.

Francesca: The signature at the end of the letter
is Roberto Rodgriguez. And there is also a telex.

Petro: Can you read it to me?

Francesca: &quot;Dear Petro, Your supervisor has told
me that you were going to Mexico and that you would
not have need of my services in the future. I hope
that you will have a lot of success in your new
position. Alicia.&quot;

Petro: Ah. That, at least is a good piece of news.

Francesca: Oh, one moment, there is another thing
that I forgot?

Petro: Yes?

Francesca: Among your papers I have found a letter
to Mexico. It seems that you did not mail it out.
Do you want me to ...

Petro: No no. Please, keep it and give it to me
later.

Francesca: Very well. That's everything. Do you
need anything else?

Petro: No, really no.

Francesca: Very well. See you.

Petro: See you.

Melville: It seems to me that we should now get
back to the meeting.

Petro: Yes, very well. It's gonna start very soon.


EXERCISE 5: (It's me, it's him, it's you):

Guide: Developments in Petro's career are progressing
very rapidly for him. Fortunately, however, he's
remaining calm. But now I'd like to hear another
time the expressions of identification that we have
been hearing.

A man: Who's answered the phone?

A woman: It's me. I'm the one who's answered the
phone.

A man: Is she the one who has written the letter?

a woman: No, it's not her. It him. He's the one
who has written the letter.

A man: Do you like this work?

A woman: Yes, it is the kind of work that I like.
It's the kind of work that pleases me.

A man: Have you worked for this company for long?

A woman: Yes, I have worked here for six years.
It is now six years that I have been working for
this company.

A man: Are you happy to be going to Geneva?

A woman: Yes, for me that's a good piece of news.

A man: Do you like to live here?

A woman: Yes, it's very nice, this apartment.

A man: Do you know how to do this exercise?

A woman: Yes, it's very easy.

A man: What are the things about Paris that you
like?

A woman: What I like are the museums and the
restaurants.

Guide: I think that I understand all this a little
better. At this point, let's see what's happening
with Petro.


SCENE 6: The Geneva Airport: Catherina and Petro
are at the airport. The plane that will take Petro
to Mexico is going to take off very soon. Catherina
says that she hopes that they will run into each
other another time after he finishes the three years
of his new contract.

Petro then expresses his hope that Catherina will
have a lot of success in her Egyptian project and
that her relations with Mr. Melville will go well
for her. Finally, he gets on the plane, expressing
his optimism for this new development in his career.

Announcer: Passengers for the Lufthansa flight
eight hundred thirty-five for Mexico who don't have
a boarding pass should board the plane immediately
through Door forty-three. Passengers with a boarding
pass are requested to use Door forty-two.

Catherina: This is your flight.

Petro: Yes. I should go there immediately, it
seems to me.

Catherina: Yes. Good. I hope that possibly
we will see each other later on.

Petro: Me too.

Catherina: Come work with us sometime later, if
you can, after your current contract is over.

Petro: I would like that a lot.

Catherina: How many years is you contract for?

Petro: Three.

Catherina: That's a lot of time, three years.

Petro: Yes, really.

Catherina: See you later, Petro.

Petro: See you later, Catherina. Good luck with
the Egyptian contract.

Catherina: Thanks. And good luck with your current
contract.

Petro: Oh, don't worry. Everything will go fine.

Catherina: Yes. Bon voyage, and good luck.

Petro: Yes. I am very happy to have gotten to
know you.

Catherina: Me too.

Petro: See you later, Catherina.

Catherina: See you later, Petro.

==What countries did they live in?==
The Inca lived in the Andes Mountains in South America.  Their range stretched from southern Chile through Argentina,  Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador and into southern Colombia.

The Inca were very warlike and often attacked their neighbors to take their land. In this way, the Inca Empire, which started out small, grew to be very large. In fact, the Inca Empire was the largest empire ever in South America, and one of the largest in the world.

==What did their buildings look like?==
The Inca lived in stone houses varying in sizes. They were all built in the Andes on flat plateaus. Their temples, however, were built on circular mounds made by the Inca, sort of like a slanted cylinder. At the top there was a plateau. On this plateau the main buildings were built.

A strange thing about the Inca was that they didn't use any iron tools to help them cut and shape the stone for their houses. Instead, they used round balls of stone to pound out blocks of stone for their buildings. The blocks of stone were not usually rectangles, but were very strange looking shapes that fit together much like the pieces of a puzzle. Many of the stone walls the Inca built are still so strong and well made that it is impossible to slide the blade of a knife between the stones.

==What did they eat?==
[[Image:Zea mays.jpg|right|thumb|Corn.]]
&lt;!-- amazedme.com/.../guinea_pig_1-759711.jpg
&lt;!-- [[Image:PuePeruvianPotatoes.jpg|right|thumb|Peruvian potatoes.]] --&gt;
[[Image:Patates.jpg|left|thumb|Potatoes.]]

The Inca ate potatoes and corn. They drank llama milk and water, and ate guinea-pigs for their daily protein, because they didn't have pigs, cows, sheep or turkeys. Occasionally, they ate llamas or alpaca.

==What did they wear?==
Typical Inca clothing would consist of a lightweight finely made poncho covered by a heavier, blanket-like poncho. They wore sandals and hats, some with fuzzy chinbands. Many rich Inca men wore large golden earrings as a symbol of how rich they were.

==What did they believe?== 
The central god of the Inca religion was the sun-god ''Inti'', the only god that had temples built for him. The sun-god was the father of the royal family. There were many gods among the Inca, but the sun-god outshone them all. The Inca also believed that there was a heaven, a hell, and a resurrection of the body after death.
The Inca worshiped the dead, their ancestors, their king whom they regarded as divine, and nature and it's cycles.

==What did their writing look like?==

[[Image:Quipu.png|right|thumb|Quipu.]]

The Inca did not have a system of writing with letters or symbols. Instead, they used a special system called ''quipu'' (pronounced KEE-poo), tying knots in ropes of different colors. The ropes were kept on special belts that the ''quipu'' writers would always wear. The different colored ropes could show deaths, weddings, trade, and other things. Being a ''quipu'' writer took many years of schooling, and because very few learned, ''quipu'' readers were very important.

==Are some of them famous even today?==
Yma Sumac is a singer who performed Inca and South American folk songs beginning in the 1940s.  She is claimed to be an Inca princess directly descended from Atahualpa.

==What is left of them today?==
[[Image:Stone windows macchupichu.jpg|left|thumb|Stone windows at Macchupichu.]]

The Inca are famous for their abandoned cities in the Andes Mountains. Some major cities like Cuzco and Machu Picchu, located in Peru, are major tourist attractions. Although many cities have been found, there are still many hidden in the jungles and under the desert floor. Archaeologists hope to one day know more about these people through their amazing artifacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to biologist Richard Dawkins, life has no purpose! This approaches the metaphysical idea of determinism which presumes every effect has a cause, so that life is simply a chemical consequence of cosmic chaos. Dawkins asserts that ethics, morality and religion are simply 'successful aspects' of  ''the selfish gene'' He favours The Universal Declaration of Human Rights approach, which is roughly the naked pursuit of happiness principle enshrined in the constitution of the USA.  

However, from the previous two chapters survey, it seems we could conclude that, for religion to be effective [[../Making Decisions/Practical Decisions|an 'ultimate goal'  is needed]] before one can make any decision rationally. Furthermore, to evolve a moral code or religion of universal significance we need a purpose of universal significance. We therefore seek a purpose that applies beyond our culture, our species and our planet—one that is ubiquitous, timeless, consequential and fundamental, immediately recognizable as worthy of unfettered support, one that is eternally compelling, able to attract and hold followers for many generations to come.

This chapter looks for such a purpose. If one can be found it should rectify two shortages: one, provide a basis for the rationale used when making moral decisions, and two, provide a solid foundation upon which a logical future universal religion might be built should this eventually be deemed desirable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Would the universe’s purpose be such a candidate? The short answer is, no, because we know of no such purpose. The universe exists and functions and we can explain and predict much of what we observe. Nothing known to us requires its operation to be subject to the constraints of some purpose.

A number of writers have suggested that God, or some god equivalent, could have programmed the universe before it began, before the initiating singularity existed. This god could have bestowed the initial parameters and laws that would force it to ultimately achieve a precisely predetermined purpose.&lt;ref&gt;This would still allow much variety. Control exerted solely by general laws of physics allows limitless unscripted scenarios to unfold between programmed birth and targeted death. (See [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]].)&lt;/ref&gt; This, these writers state, would explain why everything is “just right” for us to be here.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical physicists have shown that, if any of several physical constants (for example, the charge of an electron) were different by even the smallest fraction, then the resulting universe would be uninhabitable for life as we know it. Of course, this does not prove that a God existed. It does not mean that the universe was precisely designed to enable life to begin and eventually evolve to produce humans. The fact that we are here means only that we are here—as this universe developed, conditions arose that were and are right for life forms such as ours to evolve. If the universe existed in another form, then either our equivalents would exist in a different form, or no beings would be present asking questions such as these.&lt;br/&gt;
The most powerful argument against the proposition that the universe was designed solely to cause humanity to evolve, is that our universe might be only one of an infinite number of universes, many of which would have started with parameters that do not permit life to evolve, and just some, such as ours, that do. We do not know what exists outside of our own universe, and so cannot say whether or not this argument carries any weight.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrow and Tipler, two eminent scientists, have attempted to prove this proposition. In ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'',&lt;ref&gt;John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; they provide their rationale for stating that this universe was designed to produce intelligent life. Further, they try to show that ''Homo sapiens'' is the only form of intelligent life that can exist within this universe, and that our descendants have a specific task to perform (to regulate all matter contained within the universe). Their book makes interesting (although complex) reading.

If we want we can choose to adopt the assumption that a god predetermined a purpose for our universe and the life that it spawned. However, when doing so we should remember that this is just what was done several thousands of years ago, and those assumptions led to today’s religious beliefs. Implementing current knowledge to resurrect the same assumption ends up reintroducing the same god of old. This doesn’t help us tackle current moral questions because these questions were never asked, and so never answered, in times when our current religious texts were written. We just don’t know how prophets of old might have replied, so any statement made today is necessarily an extrapolation from what was reportedly said in the past—as such, it is simply an interpretation, and thus sure to be disputed by one religion or another.

If we are unable to know what a designing god wants, then there is little point in thinking about the possibility that a god existed (or exists) and had (or has) a purpose in its mind. This is primarily because, in our lack of knowledge, there are no bounds to what we could imagine. For example, the god could have been (or is) a spiteful monster (and a world-destroying comet could be right now on its way, because we are not turning out to be as malicious as he intended us to be . . . ). Whatever we conjure up will be drawn by the pencil of our desires and fears, and limited only by the scope of our imaginations. We gain nothing by postulating the existence of a “designer” god as Borrow and Tipler have done. We allege several gods already, and different religions’ interpretations of what each one wants seems to be adding to current confusions, not helping us rise above them.

If looking to the universe’s past to find a purpose leaves us empty-handed, what about looking to its future? We know that the universe changes. It has evolved since its time and point of origin from the very simplest that such a thing could be, to what we see today—something vast and complex. Might this change be purpose-directed?

Again, no, it does not appear to be, or at least leading authorities find no reason to think so. As far as can be determined, the contents of the universe are simply obeying known laws of physics when they change from one form to another. These laws control matter-energy interchanges, and force certain physical properties to be conserved during interactions (see [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]]). As a result, the universe unfolds in a strictly rational manner, predictable effect following deducible cause every time. (Predictable, that is, in the sense that actuaries can accurately calculate insurance risks. For instance, we can predict that life will experience more catastrophes, such as the extinctions it has endured in the past, but we cannot say exactly what will happen, nor when it will occur. Predictions can become certainties if the number of variables are reduced—for instance, I can predict that my computer will show an “a” on its monitor when I depress the “A” key.&lt;ref&gt;But see also the discussion on [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]] for additional discussions on this point.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The changes that do occur throughout the universe are not directed toward any purpose that can be discovered from within. From analyzing the universe’s overall behaviour, we can expect only one of two outcomes. Either gravitational attraction between its contents will slow, stop, then reverse its current expansion, and everything will be pulled back again to ultimately disappear into one tiny, hot hole; or, as recent observations suggest, our universe will continue to expand forever, eventually fading into a vast, black, dead frigidity.

Thus, the answer remains no; there is no purpose to be found by examining the universe’s past, or its future. And it doesn’t help to imagine that the universe was designed before its beginning with a purpose in an external god’s mind, because we have no way of finding out what this god had in mind at the time.

No; unfortunately, the physical universe, although meeting the conditions of being virtually infinite and everlasting, seems devoid of the kind of purpose we seek.

The next obvious arena to examine is the biological universe. Let’s take a look at life itself, and ask if its presence or behaviour suggests the existence of any kind of purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Again, the short answer is no; life exists, and its various forms and capabilities change, as shifting environmental conditions favour first one, then another, chance mutation. And that’s all that appears to be happening, as generation after generation meanders its way between birth and death. Biologists do not think that life is on a journey to anywhere. Evolution, they say, is natural selection and survival of the fit, nothing more.

Some two centuries ago, Reverend William Paley wrote that life’s complexity necessitated a creator (saying that, just as a found watch would require a watchmaker to explain its existence, so, too, do the complexities of life require a Maker). Although the concepts of mutations and natural selection readily explain how simple becomes complex over time, Paley’s misconception still exists. This impelled Richard Dawkins to write a book to put an end to this mystification.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''The Blind Watchmaker'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1986), 21. Dawkins evinces the same wonder about life as the Rev. William Paley expressed when he wrote that life’s complexity proves that God exists. However, Dawkins repeatedly demonstrates that the much simpler explanation—mutations accompanying natural selection over time—is the correct elucidation, easily able to account for the existence of so many different and complex species developing (and becoming extinct) in such a long time span. The book provides a delightful romp through the nuances of evolutionary theory.&lt;br/&gt;
(The title of Paley’s 1802 text was ''Natural Theology'', an evocative combination of the two words.)&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins’ text reminds us that although complex life might seem designed to non-biologists, it is simply the result of many mutational advantages being piled one upon another, generation after generation—the successful remnants of environment-surviving adaptations.

Most biologists maintain that life provides no evidence of being directed toward a purpose of any kind. However, they usually have no reason to look much beyond the collection and analysis of facts, and the formulation and testing of theories (this, after all, is their chosen mission in life). But we do have a reason to look further. It behooves us to take a second look at what is known about the origins and development of the biological universe, to see if a purpose might be hidden within the larger picture.

At least two factors that most biologists don’t usually concern themselves with can be added to our considerations. First, as discussed earlier, we can be fairly certain that life exists in many forms, all over the universe. Second, if life is so prolific (and if scientists are likely to be able to construct it in the laboratory in the not-too-distant future&lt;ref&gt;Scientists at the State University of New York recently announced that they have built an active polio virus (that paralyses, then kills, mice) using ingredients obtainable from chemical supply houses. Viruses, although they possess DNA and can replicate under the right conditions, are not considered to be living (see [[../../Life And Exploiting/Life's Beginning#cite_note-2|Life's Beginning, footnote 3]]). Nevertheless, some see this as being another step toward creating life from scratch in the laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;), then life itself may be nothing very special.

But, what might this be suggesting? If anything, it seems to be saying just the opposite of what we might like to hear. The probable abundance and possible triviality of life seems to imply the lack, rather than the presence, of a purpose.

If life’s existence and behaviour seems purposeless, then let’s see if life’s beginning shows signs of being purpose-directed.

We earlier mentioned what is known about life’s beginning. As far as we can tell, it is simply a matter of physical laws giving rise to chemical molecules that interact, with some of these interactions eventually creating molecules that develop into living entities.&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Life/The Probability That Life Exists Elsewhere#cite_note-2|The Probability That Life Exists Elsewhere, footnote 3]] for a “definition” of life.&lt;/ref&gt; There’s no more purpose to be found in such a process than there is to be found in the mere physical presence of the molecules that assemble during that process. The presence and behaviour of all matter is just another result of the presence and behaviour of the universe, and can have no more built-in purpose than the universe itself has.

Well, if the past and present tells us nothing about life having a purpose, then there is only one other place to examine—the future. As we have just mentioned, biologists usually say that they can predict nothing about life’s possible future. They know the mechanics of evolution; the fittest generally survive to parent fit offspring in greater abundance than those less fit. This behaviour doesn’t have to go anywhere; it need have no future other than to favour life’s continuation. In fact, the whole process of evolution, as it is usually described, appears to be a very laid-back process: evolve when conditions change, otherwise stay the same.

But, if we dig a little deeper, we do actually find that something more may be happening. Let me elaborate.

Evolution itself seems to be evolving. Evolution, we know, depends upon the occurrence of one or more chemical or physical happenstance’s that reshape a few of life’s molecules, which then occasionally give rise to descendants better fitted to survive environmental changes. But, this process seems to have become more than solely accidental in advanced animals. Evolution, once a passive occurrence, now occasionally seems to be an active one.

Active evolution involves two events. The first event is always passive: the occasional, random, unavoidable incident that produces a DNA nucleotide change in sperm, ovum, or zygote. A genetic mutation, which (together with its outcome—good, bad or inconsequential) will be carried into descendent generations, should they survive. These descendants may, or may not, be able to utilize this change.

Natural selection tells us that the environment provides the criteria that determines if the inherited change will be beneficial or harmful (dark stripes help to camouflage a zebra in dappled woods, for instance; they may make the animal visible to predators on sunlit plains. Thus, whether a gene mutation helps the animal to hide and survive to procreate depends upon where that animal lives.) However, there can be more going on than just passive use of an inherited feature.

Sometimes the modification to a body structure or system is passed on but lies dormant, unused, perhaps eventually to atrophy from neglect. However, occasionally, the evolutionary process is taken to a second level. Some circumstance (almost always an environmental change) causes the organism to discover how a latent ability might put to use. But, only organisms capable of learning can experience this second step, as will be illustrated.

This two-step evolutionary process seldom takes place in one generation. Mutations that are immediately beneficial are those that do not require learning anything new. Millions of these have occurred throughout life’s evolution—for example, more appropriate body structure, more efficient energy conversion, more attractive plumage, more effective camouflage, etc. These and other such changes benefit with little or no learning curve to conquer. But some parental DNA mutations bring no immediate benefit (or penalty), and these may be passed on unused and un-noticed through many generations. Only when an environmental change offers a niche where these changes might be put to profitable use, may they benefit the bearer. Thus, for example, the uses to which an opposable thumb may be put, or the advantages vocal chords offer language users, must be learned before they can benefit the possessor. Steven Pinker provides an example that illustrates how an ability most take for granted is actually the result of learning how to use an inherited capability.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, ''How the Mind Works'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that we are able to see stereoscopically because we grow two, spatially separated eyes, but we each must first train our brain to use them efficiently, and then train our mind to interpret what has been seen. Bear in mind that eyes evolved from light-sensitive cells. When these first developed, no creature possessing them would “know” how they might best be put to use; each slight advantage would have to be discovered, then experimented with, to learn how to interpret the new perceptions. Evolved change by itself is insufficient in such cases.

“Learn” is an active verb, and learning occurs in animals, but not in plants. Animals use their brains and minds to direct their bodies to obtain food and mates, and to avoid predators. What an animal learns&lt;ref&gt;Usually in small steps, and through repeated trial-and-error effort, but, increasingly, with the more intelligent animals, by way of second-level, association-recognizing, thinking.&lt;/ref&gt; and puts into practice can be copied by peers, and by offspring as they emulate their parent’s behaviour. Learned beneficial changes in both mental outlook and physical ability are thus passed on to successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;Evolutionary Psychology, an important recent advance in understanding behaviour, argues that many inherited behaviours began as evolutionary adaptations to survival or reproduction problems. See David M. Buss, ''Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple organisms like plants have not been able to evolve in this manner. Thus, the evolutionary process has itself evolved over time. In its original form, evolution benefits (or harms) future generations without their active participation. But in its later form, evolution can be a two-stage active process that operates only if animals learn how to take advantage of latent abilities.

Recently, evolution added a third capability and level to its repertoire: it can now plan its own future. Let me explain.

Two things happened after humans learned how to speak and write. First, we dramatically increased the speed at which we acquire knowledge, adapt, and change our behaviour. We learn how to extract metals, then build tools and weapons. We learn about genetics, then breed hardier crops and livestock. We learn about fats and cholesterol, then modify our diet. We learn how to survive in space, then go to the moon. What one discovers, others put into effect—increasingly within the same generation.

Second, we became able to plan our future. We have learned how to apply our knowledge to envision a desirable future, then chart a path toward that future. That is how we reached the moon; that is how we might one day reach other planets.

In essence, we now use our third-level thinking ability to consciously consider what the future holds possible. We then use it again to plan the actions necessary to obtain our desired goal.

This ability, I contend, is significant enough to be thought of as a third-stage in the evolutionary process. We have evolved to the stage of being able to take charge of—to be responsible for—our own future. Indeed, humans are verging upon the ability to take control of evolution itself. In short, we are no longer animals to whom change simply happens, or that must learn to take advantage of a latent ability before we can benefit. We have now become animals that can use words to select, far ahead of time, the kind of benefits we want evolutionary change to produce: we can then produce that change.

Is it not ironic that, just as we are learning how to plan and achieve our own future, this future can seem meaningless? If the universe and life exist with no discernible purpose, then everything subsumed within these two concepts also lacks purpose. No purpose, ergo, no meaning. What are we to do?

The answer is clear to me. If neither the universe nor life itself evince a purpose, if there is nothing anywhere that provides rational and universal direction and meaning, and if, as has been many times stated, we simply must have a purpose if we are to make decisions rationally, then we must invent one. To avoid stagnating in a moral quagmire, we must formulate a proxy purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, professor of religion and philosophy at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, states the same thing. He points out that living things make much use of deception, and that humans have always used myths to ward off nihilism and the angst that comes from realizing that the universe and life are without purpose or meaning. He calls for the invention of a “noble lie” to fill the void that our loss of belief in God has produced. See Loyal D. Rue, ''By the Grace of Guile: The Role of Deception in Natural History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I could not agree more. However, it hardly needs saying that this artifice would have limited value if we knew the myth to be a lie. What I will be suggesting we should use is not a lie. It is an assumption, declared to be just that, right from the beginning. (A noble assumption, if you like.)&lt;/ref&gt; Our history of developing religions when searching for nonexistent answers demonstrates that we have done this many times in the past. We can do so again. Therefore, if, as concluded in the [[../../Present Day Religions/Summary|Summary of Present Day Religions]], the invented purposes of past religions can no longer guide our contemporary moral decision making, then it is time to contrive a new purpose that will.

The question, nevertheless, remains: what purpose do we devise?

To ask and answer the question.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To better understand the rationale behind the choice of purpose that I will be proposing, it is necessary to first say a little more about the nature and consequences of learning.

Learning brings understanding, and understanding opens doors toward modifying and controlling events and things. When humans first lit fires in caves to keep warm, they were using what they had learned. These days, just about every aspect of our environment can be modified using our knowledge. However, while we have become adept at modifying, our ability to control is still in its infancy.

Just think what we might be able to control in the future. Scientists may soon be able to use stem cells and a patient’s DNA to grow body tissues and organs for “rejection-less” transplants, and physicians may be able to suppress the development of (perhaps even eradicate) most or all of the approximately 1,500 diseases thought to be genetically induced. Before long, we expect to be mining our neighbouring planets for rare minerals (NASA is already investigating the techniques needed), then manufacturing products on those planets. This increases the probability of eventually doing the same on exoplanets orbiting neighbouring stars. One day, perhaps not long now, physicists will learn how to build machines that will control nuclear fusion (the process that drives the stars) and so obtain virtually unlimited amounts of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Physicists have been working on this for decades. Controlled fusion is still only possible for small periods of time, and energy input still greatly exceeds energy output, but progress is being made. The internationally funded Iter Project, based in Germany, intends to build a new research and development facility (see http://www.iter.org for their latest news), and it has the longer-term goal of constructing a prototype fusion power plant. (It has been recently shown that smaller fusion reactions can be controlled more easily than large. This may reduce the projected twelve billion dollar cost.)&lt;/ref&gt; Some day we might even be able to scan and map the position of each atom within a living entity. All we will then need is a means of fashioning atoms to such a blueprint, to recreate the exact creature, with its entire memory intact, anywhere we position a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;Beam me up, Scotty! Star Trek, and similar programs, are more than just science fiction to many. They seem to be calling to, and resonating with, dormant feelings of human potentiality. However, the amount of energy required to construct the reassembling matter (or convert a supply into the form needed) will doubtlessly delay this achievement several millennia. Too far ahead for you or I to benefit, but not too far for humankind—if it survives.&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning, then controlling, is limited by only two things: by our mind’s capabilities and the constraints of the universe. There will always be facts we do not know and events we cannot control, but these will become fewer and fewer in number over the centuries and millennia ahead. Someday, perhaps a billion years into the future, perhaps sooner, life forms—possibly even remote descendants of humankind—may learn how to control the behaviour of the stars. Maybe even reposition galaxies! No law of physics prohibits such activities.

Learning how to progressively exploit our environment will not stop until life itself ceases. (We will see why this is so in the next chapter.) The extinction of one species does not prevent life from continuing. If, for example,  all species upon an island are eradicated, the life continuing in the surrounding seas, the air above, on other lands, will soon encroach to colonize the empty niches. If we annihilate ourselves, other species will survive and fill the void we leave. The story of life would continue, and we would not even be missed, a few thousand years into the future. If some occurrence were to obliterate every living thing upon this planet, life would begin again once conditions permit. This is because all the while, everywhere throughout the universe, life explores and exploits its inherited options.

Inevitably, ultimately, life will learn enough to be able to control all that can be controlled from its position within the universe. Evolution will culminate in a life form that seemingly possesses god-like powers.&lt;ref&gt;Teilhard de Chardin had a similar idea. He held that all the universe’s material and spiritual content would eventually converge into a super-consciousness that he named the “Omega Point.” See ''The Phenomenon of Man'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959). First published in French as ''Le Phénomène Humain'' (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; It won’t be a god—it will still be just life. But what an entity!

It is easy to understand why this must be so: to those living just a few hundred years ago, people of this century would appear to have abilities approaching omnipotence. Any inexplicable controlling ability may confer such a title, and impart a mystical awe—ask any successful magician. If electronic, medical and technological progress continue at today’s pace (to say nothing of the many other fields currently being exploited), then in no more than one or two hundred years time humans will certainly possess abilities that would be incomprehensible and astonishing if witnessed today. But think ahead another two thousand, or two million years. How would such powers not seem omnipotent, and where does this accumulation end?

Yet, we cannot say that it is life’s purpose to develop such abilities. Evolution’s consequences may produce a seemingly omnipotent&lt;ref&gt;Omnipotent, because with knowledge comes power; omniscience would simply be a precondition to this final state.&lt;/ref&gt; entity, but we cannot state that this endpoint must therefore be the inherent purpose that guides life’s evolution. Immense competencies accrue simply because life compiles useful abilities, compounding one upon another as it evolves—progeny taking synergistic advantage of its inheritances. As previously stated, we cannot say that life is purpose-driven because we would first have to say that life’s supersystem, the universe, was purpose-driven. And, since we can’t position ourselves outside of our universe, this can never be determined.

This omnipotent consequence of evolution is just that—a consequence. It is not, and should not be considered, an ordained purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, life and our universe have no discernable purpose. Let us return to where we started this chapter and discuss what alternative purpose, if selected, might give us a vision that we can live with and, more importantly, live for.

Please do not misunderstand what I am about to propose. Life, as I have said, cannot be proven to be directed toward a purpose. Neither existing nor evolving is a purpose—these are simply states of affairs. Demonstrating a trend toward complexity does not demonstrate purpose—it demonstrates only what happens when something new is added to something old. Nor does the ability to learn then apply what has been learned prove that life has a purpose.

But we need a purpose to rationally make the many moral decisions thrust upon us by scientific and technological advances. And we need a universally accepted one if we are to achieve any degree of unanimity. So, one must be contrived.

What I am about to propose we adopt is based upon what we now know about the universe and about our abilities within that universe. Two millennia ago, we knew little and could control next to nothing. With ideas inherited from the Pharaohs and earlier civilizations, the only future we could imagine preparing for was our personal entry into an assumed afterlife. Times are much different now. Today, we think about the future of others, including other species, as much as we think about our own. And we are beginning to realize that, collectively, we have the potential to achieve and control almost anything we care to dream about.

A word of caution before we proceed. In selecting a purpose to guide us, we must be careful not to separate ourselves from life. Past religions did this—humans held themselves different from, and superior to, all other forms of life. We know better than this, nowadays. Life itself is our parent. Other living entities are our siblings. We have no more, and no less, purpose for living than life itself has. Thus, whatever we select to be a purpose for humans, must be a purpose that applies to all other living entities, including those beyond our planet.

What, then, do we choose to be our universal purpose?

Given that there is no detectable purpose pre-designed into life or the universe, then, if we must have one, ''we must adopt a surrogate''.

To my mind, the only viable option is to support life’s continual evolution and focus upon helping it to achieve an omnipotent ability. Such a purpose is universal and rational; it is a purpose that will last as long as life itself lasts. It accommodates the whole of life, and shows that we care about more than just our own well-being. It declares that we value life for its own sake and think little about the death that must follow, taking it simply as the price to be paid for living.
 
Such a choice, if made, would be so all-encompassing it would warrant being called a “meta-purpose.”&lt;ref&gt;''Webster'' defines “meta” as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
:''Meta, prefix. “situated behind or beyond,” “later or more highly organized or specialized form of,” “more comprehensive: transcending . . . used with the name of a discipline to designate a new but related discipline designed to deal critically with the original one.”&lt;br /&gt;
::''Webster’s ''Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary'', Frederick C. Mish, Editor in Chief (Markham, Ontario: Thomas Allen &amp; Son Limited, 1986).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, the term “meta-purpose” is intended to convey the idea that its stature is greater than other purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; If we indeed determine that all evidence points to life’s evolution ultimately possessing omnipotent abilities, if selecting such an outcome could clear the way to making decisions that are both moral and beneficial to all forms of life (and this claim has yet to be substantiated, but we will examine both ideas later), then how can this not be the most logical “surrogate purpose” to choose?

(Indeed, we don’t really have any other choice if the review conducted in Part Four has any merit, for, as we will see, no other purpose is as likely to ensure our future survival.)

What this might mean, and how we might obtain benefit by adopting it, must wait to be explored until Part Four. One other matter should be presented first; a speculation about what could be causing life to evolve toward such an end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This has been a chapter of denials, where we finally acknowledge that the universe evolves only in obedience to laws that have been in existence since the moment of its birth—the purpose of which, if pre-programmed by some external deity, can never be discovered. We acknowledged also that life can arise and progress with no purpose apparent. The first life (wherever and whenever it arose) formed from atoms and molecules because conditions were conducive, and it has since evolved to become what exists today for exactly the same reason. When our star dies, so will our home, and all life that remains at home.

Some readers may find this Part of the book distressing. Such bold statements about the triviality of life and our species are not enjoyable to read. The real state of affairs is that there is no candy coating. There is no Father-in-Heaven looking down and caring for or about us—our prayers serve only to console ourselves. It is sobering to confront such truths, but are they really that much of a surprise? Haven’t we all previously, at least briefly, suspected as much, deep down inside, at one time or another?

Much as we might like it to be otherwise, we are truly alone and adrift. Alone, but accompanied by all the other life forms that this universe contains. Adrift, but slowly finding our way from ignorance to wisdom. Constantly moving from the past, when life knew nothing, to the future, when life will know almost everything. God, if He ever existed, cut us all free when He released the universe. That was when free will began, and this is exactly what free will entails: facing up to the facts, recognizing that we make the bed we lie upon, and taking the responsibility to make decisions rationally as we travel along the evolutionary pathway.&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]].&lt;/ref&gt;

But, what a journey it is! Especially now, when we are at the cusp of understanding and controlling so much. So many possibilities, so many choices; the future can seem overwhelming—indeed frightening—at times. But life can become glorious and wonderful again, bright from a new guiding light—once we build the beacon.

I think that there is much to gain by adopting life’s evolutionary consequence as a surrogate purpose, and using that to guide our decision making. Part Four examines some reasons for thinking so, and suggests what might be done with the visions such a choice generates.

But, before we rush ahead; what if these conjectures about life’s outcome are fantasies? No one wants to be misled by yet another set of assumptions, inventions and falsehoods. Although life may well have learned how to control some things, is there any plausible reason to think that it will continue to do so? From where does this ability to learn and to apply such learning come, and is this source a permanent feature of life?

When I was able to step back from my “revelation” (see [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]]) a decade or so after it happened, I began wondering what could possibly cause evolution itself to evolve. Why should it change from being just a passive “reaction-to-events” process, to becoming an active “determinator-of-its-own-future” process? I knew of none; however, such a transformation has happened, so there must be a cause to be discovered. The next chapter explores one possibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Leaving until later a discussion of the many advantages that might be gained by doing so, Chapter Nine concluded by suggesting we adopt as a “meta-purpose” the idea of supporting life’s journey to its consequence of becoming an omnipotent entity. But, as it did so, it emphasized that this whole notion might only be a possibility, and cautioned against building edifices upon faulty assumptions.

However, there may well be a reason why life, very probably not a direct descendant of life on this planet, but life, somewhere, will eventually come to possess omnipotent abilities. What we may now think to be simply a fantasy may actually occur—eventually. This chapter looks for and attempts to provide a possible reason why this might be so by reviewing what we know about life’s behaviour, then speculating about how it came to be this way.

Speculations usually have little merit beyond suggesting lines of further inquiry, but this one, to the extent that it has any validity, provides something more. It warns us to be wary of human nature, particularly as we accumulate knowledge. Thus Chapter Ten serves two purposes—it offers a theory that might explain why life seems to become ever more complex and proficient, and it reminds us that increasing powers bring increasing opportunities for “bad” as well as for “good” behaviour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We begin by noting a few facts about life’s general behaviour, starting with plants. Outwardly, plant life might appear to be passive and uneventful; endless cycles of germination, development, replication and death, with random mutations—possibly of significance to future species—happening in between. A cursory look at the life of animals might suggest the same pattern. However, as we will soon be reminded, the full story is much more complex. Each one of life’s many species is competitive,&lt;ref&gt;Darwin used the words “competition” and “competes” frequently in ''On the Origin of Species''. He knew that life is assertive. Tennyson, too, knew what much of life was about, writing, “nature, red in tooth and claw,” when penning ''In Memoriam''.&lt;/ref&gt; assertive, territorial, and occasionally very aggressive. Each does its utmost to expand into neighbouring territory, wherever it exists and whenever the opportunity arises.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus, in ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', published in 1798, was among the first to write that life (although he limited his discussion to human life) would continue to grow in numbers unless prevented by external forces. Darwin’s thoughts were influenced by that essay. This chapter takes for granted that Malthus’ principles continue to operate, and apply to all forms of life.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants fit this description, once we look at what happens over several generations. Most gardeners know that any plant will expand its domain unless curbed. Creeping Charlie is a good example; it will sow seeds and extend runners ad nauseam, and is very difficult to eradicate. Mushroom fairy rings graphically and accurately portray this expansionist behaviour, as underground mycelia spread, then fruit. In fact, the history of any plant species may be viewed as one long quest to gain territory, and an outside intercession of some kind or another is always needed to halt the process. Plants invariably enlarge their domain until prevented by an inhospitable climate or by soil that lacks nutrients or is toxic in some way, or until they are overcome by some disease agent or eaten by insects or animals.

Insects exhibit exactly the same behaviour. We have all likely read about calculations showing that the offspring from one pair of flies, unless checked in some way, would number enough to blanket the world after a few weeks. Only impediments such as lack of food, its own excrement, poisons of some kind, parasites, attacks from aggressors seeking to control the same environment—some kind of external force—will stop the population from exploding. Locusts dramatically demonstrate this phenomenon. Every few years, huge swarms of these grasshoppers arise and decimate vast areas. Insects, like plants, multiply, strengthen their control of local food sources, increase again in number, move outward, and repeat the sequence if not halted by an opposing force. In fact, it has been said that if a catastrophe killed most of the life on Earth, insects would survive and evolve to dominate what remained.

Animals, too, behave in this manner, as demonstrated by many animal population-cycle studies. Plant food supplies increase, so the number of rabbits increases; the fox population then builds, and a bunny take-over is prevented. The number of rabbits then decreases, so the fox population declines, and before we know it, we have rabbits galore again. (It is a seven-year cycle, roughly, in this example; eight years for the lemming/stoat cycle.)

No species self-limits its own population. Microbes and mice, birds and bees, fish and flowers, horses and humans; all multiply profusely unless prevented.&lt;ref&gt;Even we “modern” parents do not automatically limit the number of children we have. We use contraceptives only when we consider that additional progeny will curtail, endanger, or affect the quality of our life, or adversely affect the lives of others we care about, or when a restriction is imposed and enforced, such as in China where more than one child per couple is made illegal and penalized.&lt;/ref&gt; An external agent is always required to stop the expansion. Not infrequently, this external factor is itself living; it stops the growth of another by using this other as a source of food. The net effect of this has been to produce a precarious balance, maintained as our biosphere. The balance is preserved by each species defending what it possesses, and attacking to take what it needs.

Now, let’s consider what all this might imply. If every form of life behaves this assertively, then the assertive trait must have been present very early in the evolutionary chain. And, indeed, it was, because exploiting surrounding territory turns out to be the main characteristic that distinguishes living material from non-living material. To understand this more completely, we must again start at the beginning of the story.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biological life would not be possible without chemical interactions.&lt;ref&gt;It is precisely because life’s processes are basically chemical processes that we can treat illnesses with chemically synthesized drugs, and can chemically manipulate emotions and genes. (Indeed, genes themselves are simply chemical molecules—and not even very complex ones.)&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, chemical interactions would not be possible without physical interactions, and no physical interaction occurs that does not involve an energy exchange; consequently, all biological processes depend upon energy exchanges. Clearly it is important to understand a little about this phenomenon if we are to understand how life began and how it proceeds.

We learned in school that almost all life on our planet depends, either directly or indirectly, upon the sun’s energy, converted to usable form through photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Not all life on Earth depends directly upon sunlight, but all life requires an energy supply of some kind. As earlier noted, many simple life forms living near deep ocean hydrothermal vents or in subterranean rock crevices obtain their energy by chemosynthesis.&lt;/ref&gt; During photosynthesis, chlorophyll converts simple molecules of water and carbon dioxide into more complex molecules (particularly sugars). Photons of sunlight provide the energy required to join the simple molecules together. This energy doesn’t disappear, it becomes locked within the larger molecules (held within the electromagnetic forces that bind the chemical elements together). Plants utilize these larger molecules as nutrients fuelling other biochemical processes (breaking the molecules apart releases the binding energy). When consumed, these plants in turn fuel micro-organisms, other plants, insects and animals. In this way, the sun provides most of the energy needed by life on this planet.

Before delving a little deeper into what happens during energy exchanges within living entities, it is helpful to review a few features of non-living energy exchanges. The latter have been occurring since the universe began, and they hold the key to understanding life’s creation—that instant when energy-processing chemical molecules first became energy-processing living molecules.

All chemical processes, living or non-living, involve energy transfers. Energy is either added to (or taken from) the involved atoms and molecules (by rearranging their electronic configurations). This energy is either taken from (or added to) the external environment. For instance, the energy required to form an iron compound when iron dissolves in an acid solution, is obtained from the energy released as the relatively complex configurations of electron orbitals in the acid are rearranged to form somewhat simpler ones. Forming iron sulphate in this manner needs no additional energy from outside the interacting molecules. (Quite the opposite; this process is exothermic—it releases energy in the form of heat as it proceeds.) Burning wood is another exothermic reaction; once started, the process sustains itself. When ignited, complex organic wood molecules break apart and release energy, only some of which is needed to join carbon from the wood and oxygen from the atmosphere to form carbon dioxide and other molecules. The rest of the energy is radiated away as heat and warms the universe.

Many chemical interactions do not release energy. These processes, termed endothermic, will not proceed, even after being started, without the continuous addition of energy. Producing plastics from oil, or forming sugar molecules by photosynthesis, are examples of endothermic reactions. In such cases, the final molecular compounds contain more energy than was originally held within the atomic structures of the forming components. This energy must be added before the bonds that hold the more highly structured molecules together will form.

Although every chemical process involves energy transfers, there is a significant difference between non-living (abiotic) chemical processes and living or biological (biotic) chemical processes. Abiotic chemical processes destroy or permanently rearrange the molecular structure of the constituents taking part in the process—the end products are different from those present at the start. However, healthy living cells do not permanently destroy, rearrange (other than when growing, learning or reproducing), nor deplete their own internal molecular configurations to obtain energy. They take what energy they need from their environment, eventually giving all of it back (in degraded form). While molecular configurations change continuously during life’s many and varied processes, they are re-established before these processes end. A living entity, at the end of a long day of processing food, is much the same as it was when it started. (Indeed, unless growing, learning or reproducing, any difference between start and end configurations would be due to disease or damage.)

This energy transformation process, whereby molecules gather energy from their environment, utilize it in various ways, yet retain their unique identity unchanged after the energy utilization, distinguishes biotic from abiotic matter. Thus, the first molecular complex able to sustain an energy-transfer process unchanged, using energy extracted exclusively from the external environment, became the first living entity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The transformation from non-living to living requires two steps. First, environmental sources must provide the energy needed to add an atom or two (also taken from the environment) to a molecular complex. This changes the molecule, as it now has one or more additional atoms and a little bit more energy (the amount needed to attach the extra atoms). In the second step, this process is reversed; the added atoms and energy have to be returned to the environment—otherwise nothing more than a chemical activity is occurring (or the entity is growing, see below). Movements within the fluid environment surrounding the molecule would bring new nutrients, and the process would repeat. (Fluid environments, liquid or gas, are vital to life’s beginnings because life needs a continuous supply of energy and raw materials to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Attaching atoms to, or releasing atoms from, a molecular complex invariably results in the loss of some energy to the environment; thus the complex cannot simply reuse the same energy it has just released. (It would be a perpetual-motion machine were this not so.)&lt;/ref&gt; A point of interest: the complex would be slowly propelled and could stumble upon its own supplies, if its configuration ejected surplus atoms repeatedly in one direction.)

(Where supplies exist to form one kind of molecular complex [see [[../../Life/Possible Origins Of Life On Earth|Possible Origins Of Life On Earth]] concerning life’s beginning], other kinds of biotic complexes might also arise. Once this happens, the most efficient process would sweep up available resources. Environmental variations would favour the formation of different complexes, however. Thus, right at life’s beginning, natural selection seems inevitable.)

Occasionally, different atoms may have become permanently attached to the original molecular complex. Adding extra atoms to any molecule changes its properties; most changes would presumably prevent the complex from continuing its energy processing, and it would “die.” However, some additions would not cause “death” and would thereby enlarge the complex, which might eventually grow big enough to split apart or replicate. However, it is not growing, nor even reproducing, that hallmarks life; it is the particular kind of energy transformations that extract from “without” to utilize “within,” while the totality within retains its overall identity. Homeostasis first arose at life’s beginning, and remains a fundamental property of life, equal in stature to life’s ability to process energy.

Only one such molecule needed to form for life to begin. However, it is likely that conditions permitting the formation of the first self-sustaining molecular complex occurred in many places. If so, then many such molecules, identical or differing slightly one from another, could have formed more or less simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;It is likely that this process is ongoing, continually occurring on Earth even today at sub-life levels in fluid environments of sufficient complexity. However, energy-enriched molecules, of any kind, living or dead, make excellent fodder for omnipresent bacteria and therefore would not survive very long.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first bounded, self-sustaining, molecular complexes might not have been able to grow and split. Many might have formed only to be broken apart by external forces after existing for a period of time. Nevertheless, this situation would provide opportunities for molecular alterations to occur, and thus a variety of molecular structures to have arisen. Eons probably passed before such complexes became capable of self-replication.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman Dyson, in ''Origins of Life'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) hypothesized that life began twice; once as a metabolic (or energy-processing) entity, and once as a replicating entity, with the two forms later uniting.&lt;br/&gt;
I cannot understand how an entity could replicate without an energy-processing mechanism being involved. (A virus is a replicating entity, but (in many people’s opinion) it is not a living one. It has to control its host’s energy-exploiting mechanisms before it might be said to be living.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Replication requires a means whereby each internal physical/chemical process is duplicated in the replicated entity. A bacterium reproduces by binary fission, whereby its single chromosome replicates and the bacterium splits into two. Some one-celled animals and plants also simply duplicate each internal component then split apart (amoebae, for example, replicate this way). At some time, one or more of the prototype living molecular complexes must have developed the ability to replicate (and probably did so by growing, then fissioning).

We can now expand upon the point made in [[../The Behaviour Of Living Things/]] in this chapter: life assertively reaches for and grabs hold of new territory because it needs the energy this territory contains to continue living. Life began as an energy-exploiting process and continued in that manner. It later developed the ability to replicate and hence to evolve in the sense we use that word. Subsequent beneficial mutations conferred an increasing ability to exploit different environmental energy niches, leading, slowly but inexorably, to the complexities of the many different life forms we see all around us today.

The phenomenon of life turns out to be just the behaviour of a bunch of complex molecules, co-operating within one body in order to exploit the many various environments inside and outside that body, to obtain the energy they need to sustain and replicate themselves. The whole body is said to be “living,” but it is so only because each one of its constituent processing molecular complexes is living. In essence, biology is chemistry-in-action, and chemistry is physics-in-action. Feynman knew, decades ago, that life’s basis had to be this simple.&lt;ref&gt;See page 20 of Richard P. Feynman’s book, ''Six Easy Pieces'' (Reading Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1995). Although based upon a series of lectures first presented in 1963, their originality still makes this book very enjoyable reading.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now to return to where this discussion began. Living entities, like automobiles, need constant refuelling to run. Competition for resources, pitting one life form against another, is the inevitable result. The most able become parents to offspring that genetically inherit their parents’ capabilities. In this way, the “exploiting” trait was strengthened as it self-selected down through the ages. The urge to exploit must by now be genetically encoded.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, if the world was awash with food and there were few inhabitants, then competition need not be aggressive. Its denizens would still be “exploiting” the resources, but they would have no need to fight each other to gain a share of what is available, and the “less-able” would possibly survive and reproduce as often as the more-capable. This peaceful situation would change as the population sizes increased however, for life does not voluntarily restrict its own procreation.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural world of plants and animals is not a paradise where every living thing exists in peaceful harmony with every other living thing. It is a battleground of constant aggression, each species against all others,&lt;ref&gt;At first glance, this statement may appear to be too sweeping. Indeed, some life forms cooperate symbiotically, and many never come in contact with one another. But, I would argue, symbiotic relationships essentially create single organisms out of two—both are needed to survive. And those who never contact each other still draw upon resources that either directly or indirectly (through growth and spreading, or the distribution of waste products [via movements in the surrounding environments]) would otherwise eventually supply energy to those at a distance.&lt;/ref&gt; and within a species, one member against another. (In fact, it is precisely because species members compete against each other that species evolve into different species, as the Grant’s work with the Galápagos finches showed.) Nature only appears peaceful because we rarely notice the underlying conflict. Expansion and conquest take place slowly, as with plants; or unnoticed, as is usually the case with insects; or hidden in the underbrush, as happens mostly with birds and animals. When we eulogize the peacefulness and serenity of nature we do not recognize the irony we mouth. All species compete for territory to obtain resources. As these resources become depleted it is inevitable that this competition will become more and more intense, most particularly between members of the same or closely related species, for they eat the same types of food and prefer the same kind of habitat.&lt;ref&gt;This suggests a direct relationship between perceived population pressure and aggressive human behaviour.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may not be pleasant to think that life aggressively exploits its surroundings,&lt;ref&gt;I have searched many times for a better word than “exploit” to define what life does. Exploit is a harsh word, and conveys many negative images and feelings. But I can find no other word so descriptively accurate. (We will better understand why this is so as we continue.)&lt;/ref&gt; battling with any life form that gets in its way, but that is the nature of the beast. (In fact, as Dawkins stated, animal speed, eyesight, hearing, and so on, increases precisely because they are taking part in “arms races.”&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, ''The Blind Watchmaker'', 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The notion of a non-evolving, non-varying, non-exploiting, life form is non-sense. Non-exploiting life forms are dead life forms—living and exploiting are one and the same process. Further, much as we might dislike the idea that we humans exploit, we can find plenty of evidence that even the best of us live via exploiting and protecting what we have.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence and Nohria, condensing work conducted by many into one comprehensive theory, state that humans are controlled by four drives: Acquire, Bond, Learn and Defend. This is too many, in my opinion. I think that just two drives can account for the behaviour of all species—Exploit and Reproduce. The compulsion to exploit, to me, contains Lawrence and Nohria’s concepts of Acquire, Defend (what one has acquired), and much of Learn (we learn to better exploit). The urge to reproduce is equivalent to their drive to Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
See Paul R. Lawrence and Nitin Nohria, ''Driven: How Human Nature Shapes Our Choices'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Who does not eat? Who would not buy stock if a genuine opportunity to gain presented itself? Actions such as these ably demonstrate that we all exploit when given the opportunity. Humans may not exploit every time, and we are usually selective in what, and who, we exploit. But some people are less circumspect than others, and some of their exploiting activities cause extensive grief and trouble to many.&lt;ref&gt;If it is life’s basic nature to exploit, then we would be foolish to ignore or deny this fact. Recognizing that life lives through exploiting allows us to explain much, and facilitates the correction of excesses when they occur. We do ourselves no favour by refuting the nature of reality, regardless of how unpalatable it may seem.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is a topic to be discussed further, in Part Four, when we explore how excessive exploitation might rightly be identified and constrained.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once begun, life continued—exploiting, growing, replicating and diversifying, extracting energy from disorder, being occasionally knocked back many stages as environmental catastrophes occurred, eventually to arrive as we find it today. This continuous pattern is all that has been needed for life to become first, ever more complex, and second, ever more intelligent, as we will see.

The majority of life forms that populate this planet today are incredibly more complex than those that existed a billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;A billion years ago was near the end of the Proterozoic Eon, when bacteria, prokaryotes, eukaryotes and multicellular organisms existed in the oceans, but the lands were barren. See [[../../Life/Development Of Life On Earth|Development Of Life On Earth]] for a little more detail.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, ever since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have known why organisms become more complex. Since most changes are merely modifications to an existing structure, their incorporation adds another layer to that structure. Complexity results, simply because amendments are necessarily added to what has existed before.&lt;ref&gt;This is why, to quote Ernst Haeckel (a German biologist, 1834-1919), “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,” i.e., fetal development restates evolutionary history. Presumably, research will show gene expression successively turning on stored instructions in the same sequence as evolution changed the species. (This also suggests that, sooner or later, body structures become so burdened by their out-grown history that radical change—evolutionary surgery—occurs, and gene expression is turned off.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the old abilities remain, most still active underneath—the new ones simply extend the entity’s capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;The brain is a clear example of this. The cerebrum, considered the seat of intelligence where the brain’s most complex functions (i.e. problem solving) are carried out, is outermost. The cerebellum (which co-ordinates movements) and the medulla (which helps to maintain respiration and other involuntary functions) lie underneath, on either side of the thalamus (which directs all sensory signals—except smell sensations—to and from the brain). The hypothalamus (which regulates many basic body functions such as temperature control, sexual and emotional behaviour, urges to eat and sleep, and so on) lies near the centre of the brain. And at the core, the central brain stem carries out the most basic and primitive tasks—those of regulating heart rate, blood pressure, regurgitation and respiration, as well as conducting electrical signals to and from the body’s organs and systems. This construction demonstrates how one complex body structure, the brain, has been formed: modifications that proved useful to survival were outgrowths of earlier ones.&lt;/ref&gt;

But before they can serve any useful purpose, many changes in body structure and functioning have first to be controlled and directed. A slight increase in finger length or joint flexibility, for instance, offers no survival benefit at all unless the animal can manipulate the modification to gain an advantage over its competitors. This almost always calls for an increase in physical or body-activating skills, which in turn call for an increase in the mental skills needed to manipulate body parts, or to utilize improvements in sensory perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Brain imaging provides physical evidence that this occurs. As different portions of the brain control different body functions, imaging its pattern of electrical activity reveals which functions are being called upon. Using this technique, it has been found, for example, that the brains of violinists grow unusually high numbers of synaptic connections in the area which controls the finger movements of the left hand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motor ability does not come out of the blue; in the modified finger example above, the change requires controlling by finger, wrist, and/or arm muscles, which in turn have to be exerted in new ways. As an example, random poking into crevices to extract bugs or maggots would flex and train these muscles, and this activity feeds information to the brain. Over time, the brain learns which incoming stimuli have been produced by which finger movements. Sooner or later, the brain reverses this process, sending impulses to a specific finger to produce the desired results. Thus, a genetic mutation that caused a body change has led to a new skill being learned, a result noted in the previous chapter in the suggestion that the evolutionary process itself has evolved due to an animal’s ability to learn.

Yet the increased mental capacity is not inheritable. The animal’s offspring learn, through observation, repetitive play and practice, how to use their body’s abilities. Other times, as often with humans, they are deliberately taught. What is learned is stored via synapse development between the brain’s neurons, and becomes part of one or more of the animal’s mental constructs. Infants’ brains explore the body’s capabilities and limitations; they learn what can be controlled by attempting many movements and activities. Additional, mutation-created, physical capabilities require additional, learned, mental capabilities, to obtain this control. As noted in [[../../Thinking/The Mind|The Mind]], learning (linking the information held within neural networks) and intelligence are different aspects of the same phenomenon. Thus, evolution trends toward intelligence simply because a greater intelligence is needed to control a more complex body.

Intelligence is the ability to solve problems, i.e., in earlier terms, the ability to recognize new relationships amid the memories and stimuli present within the mind, to make new neural connections, then to apply this new understanding in some useful way.&lt;ref&gt;Applying new understanding may be as mundane as filling in a box on an IQ test sheet, as overlooked as recognizing a face in a crowd from an earlier chance meeting, or as practical as designing a bridge. Intelligence is expressed through actions that result from biochemical flows through neural links consciously formed by an animal.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the mere possession of a large storehouse of facts, theories, or knowledge. These are just the material, the nuts and bolts, with which intelligence works to build theories and constructs, to solve problems and make decisions. Knowledge can be lost in one generation; intelligence cannot.

Two points must be emphasized. First, evolution trends toward complexity and intelligence, not toward humans. There is nothing inevitable or sacrosanct about our current dominance on this planet. Any language-using species will develop a similar intelligence, given time, although that species’ morphology and history would likely nudge its intelligence to develop in different directions from ours. Second, the fact that intelligence develops is not evidence that life has been directed toward it. Life evolves the way it does solely as a consequence of the physical parameters present at the universe’s birth, those that have structured every item and every event since that time. This accounts for all that exists and all that occurs. Intelligence is no different from other phenomena and needs no other kind of explanation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once again we have attempted to ascertain where we are directed by an analysis of the facts, and once again we are brought to the same conclusion. Nothing other than the universe’s inaugural physics has been needed to bring into existence everything that lies about us. It has taken more than a dozen billion years to produce us. We cannot predict what billions of years more will bring, but we can predict that life’s evolution will continue for as long as the universe has energy sources to exploit. And we can predict that life will continue its trend toward greater intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;And toward complexity, but its complexity will be that of the mind rather than that of the body. Humans are developing technology that will transform society, and this technology is becoming indispensable. Today we have instant messaging between places anywhere in the world. Tomorrow we will have the ability (via nanotechnology, and perhaps otherwise) to manipulate individual atoms and molecules. This will have immense consequences, affecting everything from genetics to space exploration. The tools and devices of the future will have to be created, used and maintained by minds well-versed in complex matters, a situation likely to create the conditions where mental complexity confers greater opportunities to survive and procreate.&lt;br/&gt;
Incorporating electronic circuits into the brain (already being performed to confer hearing and sight, with much more likely to take place within the next decade) will create a different, but possibly equally viable, kind of mental complexity.&lt;/ref&gt; because we can foresee that the energy it needs to survive will become progressively harder to procure. Thus, the universe’s initiating conditions alone seem to demand the eventual formation of an entity possessing what we would today call omnipotent abilities.

Barrow and Tipler reach the same conclusion. In ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' they do their best to prove that life must continue to expand until it can regulate everything within every universe that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', 675 and 677.&lt;/ref&gt; I do not think that we can categorically state that such a life form must evolve, but I do think that its eventual appearance is highly likely. This is why I suggest making this consequence the “purpose” we are seeking. An artifice, certainly, but a necessary one, in the absence of any more-irrefutable purpose. A “surrogate purpose” if you like, but one that is more than adequate for, as we will see, it offers a profound morality-guiding potential.

Feinberg, in ''The Prometheus Project'',&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Feinberg, ''The Prometheus Project: Mankind’s search for long-range goals'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1969), 147.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that we deliberately choose the goal of creating a universal consciousness, then work toward its realization. It is preferable and more realistic, I think, to let life develop its own way to its ultimate “goal.” All we need do, to survive and grow, is to support, rather than hinder, life’s progress. Life’s “goal” may not be to possess god-like abilities. But it seems likely that evolution’s trend toward intelligence will bring such a being (or, at least, such a capability) into existence. I’m simply proposing that we consider this eventuality, think about adopting it as a surrogate “meta-purpose,” and—if we think it useful to do so—use it to guide certain aspects of our global decision making. For just as long as it suits our needs. If it turns out later, when we know more, that life’s evolution is trending toward some other outcome, then that will be the time to re-evaluate our choice of guiding “purpose.”

Similar recommendations have been made by others, but perhaps none are as appropriate to the theme of this book as one made by Ursula Goodenough. She saw the need to have and be guided by a planetary ethic and proposed “The Epic of Evolution.”&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough, ''The Sacred Depths of Nature'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), xv and 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Yes, indeed. This is exactly what we need.

How we might go about developing such an ethic and what it might entail are topics that will be discussed in Part Four.

      <text xml:space="preserve">That life evolves, and increases in complexity and in intelligence, is a fact. Why it does so is a theory, and natural selection is a very good one indeed. Life’s exploitation of nature is a fact. The way it may have begun doing so, sketched in [[../Life And Exploiting/Complexity, Intelligence And Evolution|Complexity, Intelligence And Evolution]], is little more than speculation. While we can ignore theories and speculations (all we lose is a degree of understanding), if we ignore facts we may lose our species’ survival.

All life needs energy, and all life, wherever it exists throughout the universe, will be following the same steps; surviving if able to exploit an energy niche, dying if not, with survivors who possess the ability eventually moving out to exploit resources of neighbouring environments.

Life learns what it can about its environment in order to better exploit what is available. Increases in knowledge are accompanied by increases in the ability to control, a necessary feat if life is to extract all that is available from a declining resource. This results in what has occurred on this planet—life becomes more complex, and its problem-solving ability or “intelligence” develops. In retrospect, humans of past cultures appear primitive. So will we, when looked back upon by life in the distant future.

A million years, even a hundred million years, is nothing to life. It has already existed on this planet for more than three billion years; our sun will still be providing life-giving energy another four billion years from now. Life here and further out in the universe, appears to have all the time it needs to reach its full potential.

To reiterate; the possibility that life will eventually evolve into an omnipotent being is not life’s purpose (unless we return to imagining a god pre-designing the universe toward this end). Life needs no purpose to evolve; all it needs is the ability and freedom to exploit environmental resources. Nonetheless, possession of god-like or omnipotent abilities seems very likely to be life’s eventual outcome.

(We will be referring to the idea of life evolving to become an omnipotent Being several times. This entity needs some kind of name. [As noted in [[../Looking For A Purpose/Learning And Purpose#cite_note-2|Learning And Purpose, footnote 3]], de Chardin called a similar culmination to life’s evolution the Omega Point.] As an irreverent convenience, I’ll call it oB, short for omnipotent Being.)

It might be simpler to believe that a god existed before the universe began, that it started the universe and that its laws created all that we find within. By believing so, all our unknowns are rolled into one, and we feel less driven to find the evidence required to support such an assumption. It would also be especially comforting to believe that this god plays some ongoing part in humankind’s existence. However, miracles are rare and highly suspect to anyone with a logical mind. No rational person sits down and waits for a miracle to get them out of a predicament.

Furthermore, it is irrational to believe that solely one’s own religion, and no other, holds the truth. Humans have thought this way for long enough, and, after centuries of disagreement, culture clashes, fighting and wars, have ended up where we are today—amid much religious bitterness, baggage, and confusion.

We can make a fresh start. We can learn from and apply, rather than deny or distort, the scientific facts we have uncovered. We can start by being rational, just as people tried to be hundreds or thousands of years ago when founding the religions we have inherited. We can consider what evidence there is to support the proposed meta-purpose, the conjecture that life itself will evolve to possess omnipotent abilities. Those for whom the evidence is strong enough may, if they also think the suggestion has merit, adopt it as the purpose they use to guide collective decision making (possibly in the manner suggested in [[../Determining Moral Behaviours/]]).

That many, even most, of the world will continue to follow the dictates issued by their current religion is inevitable. It also matters little, and is not unwelcome. Rather, it is desirable, for individual freedom (in all actions that do not harm others) is essential to life’s vitality. The universal religion (whose development is touched upon in [[../A Universal Religion/]]) does not replace existing religions. It is best regarded as an “umbrella” doctrine whose principal use is to provide moral guidance relevant to the collective action of communities and nations when guidance is otherwise confused or non-existent. With careful development, the old and the new tenets need not compete; they can reinforce each other, with one lending a hand when the other calls for aid.

== Introduction ==

Voice over IP (or VoIP) is an emerging technology allowing encapsulation of voice telephony services within IP (Internet Protocol) for transmission over IP networks, such as the Internet.

VoIP technology provides cheap and flexible voice telephony by utilizing packet-switched networks for voice data, providing a much cheaper solution than traditional circuit-switched telecommunications services, while also allowing termination of IP calls closer to the intended destination, avoiding long-distance tolls.

With the global prevalence of broadband technology at home, interest in telecommunication technology and a move away from traditional copper line telephony, there is a lot of industry interest in VoIP technology.

== Purpose ==

This book is intended for those who possess moderate to high computing skills. The initial sections of the book, dealing with VoIP history and simple VoIP deployment for home and small business users, is specifically written to allow those interested in VoIP technology to get an opportunity to try it out without getting too technical. For those more technically inclined, subjects such as VoIP protocol analysis and advanced PBX functions are discussed toward the end of the book.

== Moving away from traditional telephony ==

There are many compelling reasons for individuals and businesses to invest in Voice over IP. For smaller businesses or home users who frequently make long distance or timed phone calls, to larger commercial ventures looking to reduce costs on site-to-site telephony.

The range of VoIP plans available also allow more flexibility and cost control. Because VoIP termination does not involve any physical rental or consume resources when idle, plans are available on a per-use or prepaid basis, on a monthly subscription basis, or in any number of other configurations.

A successful VoIP deployment requires good planning and a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of IP Telephony. Using the right hardware, the right VoIP provider(s), and a customised dialplan can save significant amounts of money.

Both the positive and negative aspects of VoIP technology are detailed in the following sections.


=== Benefits of VoIP ===

'''Cheaper long-distance''' - Because VoIP calls can be terminated anywhere in the world, long-distance calls can be made for much cheaper rates. For example, if you are a European VoIP user who frequently calls US numbers, you can purchase VoIP termination credit from a US VoIP provider, which will generally offer near local call prices from anywhere in the world.

'''Incoming Calls''' - For the same reason as above, VoIP provides the ability to obtain incoming telephone numbers from anywhere around the world, routed to you over the Internet. It's possible to obtain US 1-800 numbers, for example, no matter what your location.

'''No copper rental''' - Without the need for a circuit from your residence or business to your telephone company's exchange, your monthly costs can reduce significantly. Yet, there must be some means of connectivity from the &quot;End User A&quot; who initiates a call onto the Internet. Ostensibly, this connection is either a broadband connection (Cable or Telco DSL), or a &quot;dial-up&quot; connection. In both cases, and in this sense, obviously a copper rental is required. 

'''Dial-Plan freedom''' - Using a dial plan, you have the ability to direct your softphone, hardware phone or VoIP gateway to send calls to different VoIP gateways or via land-line, depending on the number dialled. You also have the ability to set priority numbers, directing the gateway to drop an existing call in favour of the priority call where no lines are available.

'''Free IP-to-IP Calls''' - Where both the caller and recipient are using VoIP to place/receive calls, and where the correct configuration exists (see the section on ENUM at the end of this book), calls can be placed entirely over the Internet without any charge.

=== VoIP Issues ===

As with any new technology, Voice over IP has its share of issues which must be considered carefully before implementation.

'''Emergency and Information services''' - There is no guarantee that calls terminated over IP for numbers such as 911 and 411 (in the United States) will be correctly routed. Due to the lack of location-specific termination of Voice over IP calls, it is not possible for such services to determine your location, and it is possible that the gateway your calls are terminating on does not have access to such numbers at all.

This limitation, and suggestions for workarounds, are discussed later in this book.

'''Bandwidth Issues''' - VoIP protocols can be very sensitive to both bandwidth limitations and network latency. Generally, VoIP calls must be placed via a broadband connection. Where there is heavy bandwidth utilization, high network latency, or the gateway is a significant distance from the user, call quality can be heavily degraded with the possibility that there will be no VoIP service at all.

See the chapter entitled '''traffic shaping and bandwidth control''' later in this book for suggestions on how this can be controlled.

'''NAT/PAT Issues''' - NAT (Network Address Translation) and PAT (Port Address Translation) are used to provide connectivity to machines in many situations such as private networks which require Internet connectivity.

With NAT, a gateway/router system will translate an IP address from the source address provided by the machine into another IP address entirely. NAT is often confused with PAT; however NAT provides a 1:1 relationship, eg. 192.168.10.10 will be translated to 203.10.10.10.

PAT is a slightly different translation. With PAT, one or more public IP addresses exist for any number of private/translated addresses. In the most common setup, a home user may have a residential DSL connection and a single public IP address, however they may have several computers on a private network behind their gateway/router which require Internet connectivity.

With PAT, the router/gateway will translate all private IP addresses into the public address provided, and will keep track of which ports established via this address belong to which private IP addresses, allowing the machines to share the public IP address.

VoIP protocols often have inherent issues with NAT and PAT. Due to the prevalence of these gateway devices for cable, wireless and DSL users, even users with single machines may find that PAT is performed by default via their router.

Please see the section immediately below entitled '''VoIP Protocols''' for more information on which protocols in particular are affected by NAT and PAT and how to avoid problems.

== Standard Architectures for Next Generation Networks ==

=== IMS(IP Multimedia Subsystem) ===

IMS is currently in development and testing phases, and was originally developed by 3GPP as an architecture for Mobile Networks. 

IMS describes a full architecture that uses IP technologies to transport all traffic (both Voice and Data). It tries to re-use existing protocols defined by IETF and other standards bodies instead of re-inventing the wheel. Some of the protocols it reuses are SIP, MEGACO/H.248, SIGTRAN and DIAMETER.

=== TISPAN ===

TISPAN reuses as much as possible from the IMS architecture and complements it with the required elements to serve fixed/wireless networks.

The work developed by TISPAN is then feed back into IMS.

== Voice over IP Technology ==

The term VoIP is often used to describe general IP telephony technology. Behind this term lies a range of different protocols, languages used to communicate between a range of different devices and vendors.

These protocols are one of the most important factors in choosing a VoIP solution. It is generally impossible to get different devices to communicate, unless they support the same protocol.

=== VoIP Protocols ===

The following protocols are associated with VoIP voice call termination and inter-gateway communication.

'''H.323''' - H.323 is used by many commercial vendors for IP telephony, It is a suite of protocols 
which includes H.245, Q.931, etc. This suite takes care of session establishment between phone and switch and is heavily based on the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) signalling protocols. Signalling part is also taken care by this protocol. This suite uses RTP, RTCP, RSVP for actual data transfer and QOS between phones.

'''SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)''' - SIP is a standard developed by the [http://www.ietf.org IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)] for use in establishing multimedia sessions such as voice, instant messaging and video, amongst other applications.

SIP is also responsible for the implementation of other voice session related functions such as holding voice calls, transferring calls, or hosting several voice conversations simultaneously (call conferencing).

SIP utilises the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to negotiate data types available at either end.  Voice and video data carrying is typically performed with the RTP and RTCP protocols.

'''MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol)''' - MGCP is a protocol typically used internally to systems to represent the whole system as a single entity.  MGCP systems are made up of Call Agents and Gateways.  The Call Agents keep stateful information and offload the majority of the control work from the Gateway(s).  Voice and video carrying is performed by RTP and RTCP.

'''MEGACO/H.248''' - MEGACO is very similar to MGCP and is the standard used for Call Agent architectures.

'''IAX (Inter Asterisk eXchange)''' - The IAX protocol was developed by a team of open-source developers working on the [http://www.asterisk.org Asterisk] project, a very popular and successful open-source PBX described later in this document.

There is not much industry support for IAX, however support has been slowly increasing. There has been a lack of good documentation for the IAX protocol, and many commercial vendors are hesitant to give their support to a protocol not ratified by a standards body such as the IETF or ITU.

'''LTP (Lightweight Telephony Protocol)''' - the LTP is a binary lightweight protocol that is NAT friendly and based entirely on free codecs. It is easily understood and in use since 1999.

=== VoIP Phone Hardware/Software ===

VoIP hardware and software implementations allow phone calls to be placed over IP. Software which uses a computer's soundcard device to provide voice input and output is known as a Softphone.

Several hardware devices exist to provide VoIP telephony. ATA devices provide standard phone ports, allowing standard phone handsets and other devices such as fax machines to utilize VoIP services. Specialised VoIP handsets are also available, often providing advanced features supported by VoIP gateways.

Hardware phones generally provide a better quality VoIP experience than Softphones; however the convenience of not requiring extra hardware, and the smaller expense involved in Softphone products make softphones a popular choice.

==== Softphones ====

A softphone is a soundcard device to provide voice input (via microphone) and sound output (via headphones/speakers) without the need for extra hardware. Handsets and headsets are available which plug into the soundcard and resemble normal phone headsets/handsets, making softphone use more comfortable.

A popular open source softphone that runs on both Windows and Linux platforms is [http://ekiga.org/ ekiga] which supports both H.323 and SIP protocols. [http://www.xten.com/index.php?menu=products&amp;smenu=xlite Xten X-Lite] is another popular free Softphone which provides all necessary features to initiate and receive phone calls via SIP. A list of some of the softphones available can be found on voip-info.org [http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=VOIP+Phones#SoftPhones here], and on Wikipedia [[w:List_of_SIP_software#SIP_clients|here]].

==== VoIP Handsets ====

==== ATA Adaptors ====

`ATA (Analog Telephone Adaptor) Devices provide the ability to connect standard telephone handsets to a hardware unit which provides VoIP capability.

An advantage of ATA devices is the ability to connect other telephony devices, such as TTY devices, FAX machines, Pay TV units and even modems.

=== VoIP Gateway Systems ===

This chapter deals with the complex world of VoIP gateway systems. These systems are responsible for providing some amount of call control and routing from VoIP phone devices.

Each of these systems is responsible for receiving calls from a VoIP handset, ATA or softphone device via a supported VoIP protocol, consulting a dial-plan or other call routing table, and correctly routing the call. Other features made available by some or all of these gateways include:

'''Authentication''' - Ensuring that clients have permission to use VoIP resources.

'''Call Accounting''' - Providing tracking of calls via the gateway, including reports and cost controls.

'''Complex Dialplans''' - Most dialplans configured on simple devices such as ATAs and softphones only allow for a very straightforward dialplan configuration. Using a VoIP gateway such as Asterisk, factors such as time of day, or even values obtained from external sources can be used to determine which path a call should take.

'''Hardware Integration''' - Most gateways provide the ability to interface with physical hardware such as FXS (internal line) and FXO (PSTN line) cards to create a PBX system. They additionally provide the dialplan configuration to determine which calls should route via IP, and which should utilize a card. It is important when selecting gateway software to evaluate which devices they support, and ensure yours is listed. Some devices (for example, Cisco line cards) may require the vendor's specific implementation of VoIP gateway for any support at all.

'''Internal Numbering''' - Some gateways offer the ability to provide internal extension numbering for clients, allowing one VoIP device to dial another device registered on your local gateway using a short internal extension number.

==== When would you use a VoIP gateway? ====

In which situations would you use a VoIP gateway product?

Generally, if you require an advanced configuration such as advanced call accounting for billing, cost controls, complex dialplans, or the ability to call between extensions, you should implement a gateway solution.

If you are interested in integrating extra hardware such as FXO cards (interfaces to the PSTN) you MUST use a gateway product.

If you are designing VoIP solutions for mid-large size business, or will be requiring IVR (Interactive Voice Response) functionality, you should implement a VoIP gateway.

=== VoIP PABX Integration ===

== Advanced VoIP Configuration ==

=== Traffic shaping and bandwidth control ===

=== Correctly terminating emergency calls ===

Particular attention should be given to ensuring that emergency calls on VoIP lines are handled correctly. In some cases, it may not be possible to provide useful or reliable emergency service via VoIP services. In this case, it may be possible to offload emergency calls to a landline service.

If reliable emergency service is not available, the handset or VoIP device should clearly be marked with a warning.

Some VoIP providers allow emergency calls to be routed via their service; however this is only of use if you are within an area covered by the receiving emergency call centre. Additionally, a lack of bandwidth or Internet service or a power loss can lead to loss of emergency service via telephone.

==== Suggestions for dealing with emergency calls ====

If a functioning landline handset is nearby, it is advisable to attach a notice to the VoIP device directing emergency calls to the landline. It is much easier for emergency services to assist if they have information on your location which is generally not available via VoIP calls.

Where calls are handled by a gateway administered by yourself or your organisation, and the ability to route certain calls via landline exists, the dialplan for your VoIP gateway should immediately route emergency calls via the landline, and where possible, any active conversations should be dropped if there are not sufficient lines to handle the call.

It is important to find out whether your VoIP provider(s) offer emergency numbers, what areas they are able to cover and whether they are able to provide enhanced emergency services such as e911 initiatives which allow providers to transmit information on subscribers to 911 call centres.

Ensure that emergency calls are routed via the most appropriate gateways in your dial plan.

=== Incoming telecommunications services ===

=== IVR (Interactive Voice Response) application ===

IVR applications are automated response units which receive input from the user (traditionally in the form of DTMF) and allow the user to progress along a pre-set interactive path. For example, a menuing system where the IVR may announce ''Press 1 for Sales, 2 for Marketting'' and then await user input.  Once the user input arrives the IVR unit may patch through the call to another line and/or may provide a pre-recorded message.

== ENUM/E164 Technology ==

The following section is quite technical, as it deals with complicated infrastructure and the integration of VoIP into core internet technologies.

The ENUM protocol (described in RFC document [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3761.txt RFC 3761]) translates standard telephone number routing (known as E.164, as the ITU defines the standard by which telephone numbers are assigned in the E.164 standard) into an addressing scheme able to route to VoIP (eg. SIP/H323) gateways using DNS technology.

ENUM technology allows VoIP servers to use the DNS infrastructure to query routing paths for terminating voice calls given a phone number. 

When a call is initiated to a given phone number, a VoIP gateway capable of ENUM service will query the provided number in DNS to determine whether there is a path other than the PSTN line available to the destination service.

This allows providers to advertise paths via VoIP to services otherwise only available via a VoIP to PSTN gateway.

ENUM records may contain other information in addition to a VoIP gateway address, such as a web URL or e-mail address.

=== Private vs Public ENUM databases ===

The public ENUM database is a collection of ENUM records, known as NAPTR RRs in DNS speak, which map telephone numbers to VoIP service gateways. These records are stored in a hierarchical tree beneath the e164.arpa domain.

Records within the e164.arpa domain are delegated to their responsible owner via the E.164 addressing convention. Much like the in-addr.arpa domain, which is used to provide mapping of IP addresses to names, these records are delegated in blocks to the agency responsible for this number assignment.

The agency is then responsible for further smaller delegations where necessary. As a result, it is unlikely that individuals or small businesses will have access to provide ENUM records for their telephone numbers.

It also stands to reason that telephone companies would be hesitant to allow telephone calls destined to their customers to instead terminate over the Internet, as much of a phone company's revenue would be derived from call termination fees, charged to carriers for calls terminating on a company's network.

This is unfortunate for end users. Via the ENUM database, you would have the opportunity to direct VoIP-based calls to terminate over the Internet via your VoIP gateway, rather than via a phone line.

For this reason, several free ENUM databases have been created to allow users to share alternate IP-based paths to their phone numbers. Most ENUM aware gateways will allow additional 'search domains' to be configured, providing access to these unofficial databases.

Whilst configuring a gateway to query these extra domains can dramatically reduce costs by terminating calls over IP, therefore freeing copper lines/voice channels for both the caller and recipient, there is an important factor to consider. If a malicious or unauthenticated entry is added, an attacker can direct calls for a phone number to an arbitary VoIP gateway.

Consider the example of rival businesses. If Business A were tech-savvy and entered their competitor's number into a public directory, directing calls to their own VoIP gateway, any calls placed via a VoIP gateway configured to query that directory would be directed to Business A's phone, rather than the intended recipient, Business B.

Some of these directories require voice verification of ownership when you register phone numbers. Others do not require verification or have dispute resolution policies which deal with disputes on a case-by-case basis.

Another less serious but still important consideration is the possibility that your information will be harvested from the database, or sold by the database owner. ENUM information may be valuable to advertisers or phone spammers, as it would provide them with a list of valid phone numbers, and allow them to call for free via IP.

=== Public ENUM registries ===


==== Commerical Registries ====

==== ENUM Trial Registries ====

Many ENUM trial registries are becoming available. Most of these registries are regional, and often are limited by telephony provider, limited number of trial participants, or a trial fee.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What does the kernel do when you boot your computer? There are several major steps that happen prior to the logon screen appearing when you boot the GNU/Linux system. In order they are:

==Firmware/Post==

Your computer firmware/BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is a small computer program whose starting address is loaded into the program counter register of your computer's CPU when power is applied to your system.  The firmware/POST (Power-On Self Test) performs a few rudimentary tests on your computer system (usually memory checks, including possibly a barber-pole memory sieve routine to check your memory, checks to see if you have a keyboard, mouse, hard drive, etc. on your system.  It then goes through a user defined list of devices, looking for a small program called a boot loader.  The list of devices could be a CD-ROM, DVD drive, hard disk, etc. When it finds a bootloader, it loads the boot loader's starting address into the CPU's program counter register.

==Bootloader==
The Linux bootloader may be [[w:en:LILO|LILO]], or now more commonly [[w:en:GRUB|GRUB]].  The bootloader may have only one operating system to boot, or it may have several, and if it has several, it presents a list of which system to load.  The operating system need not be GNU/Linux.

If the GNU/Linux operating system is selected, and the system is on Intel X86/32 hardware, then the bootloader is running in &quot;real&quot; x86 mode (running as if the CPU is an 8086), even though the processor may be a Pentium 4/Celeron/Xeon.

The job of the bootloader is to reset all CPU registers, load an operating system into memory and start it running by loading the starting address into the CPU's Program Counter.  Since the Intel 8086 couldn't support more than 640k of memory and the modern Linux kernel is bigger than 640k, special jump instructions (trampoline) are used to load the compressed Linux kernel called the zImage into memory.

The bootloader loads several programs to help it do this job, including '''setup.S''' and '''system'''.

setup.S is responsible for getting the system data from the BIOS, and putting it into appropriate places in system memory. setup.S asks the BIOS for memory, disk, and other parameters, and relocates itself and system from the low memory location where it was loaded, to a &quot;safe&quot; place: 0x90000-0x901FF (INITSEG), where the boot-block used to be. setup.S then uncompresses the compressed (zImage) kernel image at starting address 0x10000 or 64K, just beyond the firmware's data space (SYSSEG). It then moves the uncompressed kernel from address 0x10000 to address 0x1000 (4k, leaving one page of low memory free) switches from &quot;real&quot; x86 mode to emm386 mode, and loads the kernels' starting address into the CPU's Program Counter register (starts the kernel running).

One of the last things setup.S does is run the video setup and detection code, video.S. The shuffling of the kernel back and forth in memory is to overcome limitations of the PC BIOS memory addressability (640k), and free up several hundred kilobytes of system memory (the actual amount freed is reported by the system).  The 4k is used for handling virtual memory.  The special load instructions (trampoline) are required to 'cheat' the system, as the instructions load part of the kernel into memory locations beyond the 640k barrier that the (then currently running &quot;real mode&quot;) system knows about.  In the process of shuffling the kernel around, the memory originally written to by the BIOS, and also where the setup and system programs were loaded are overwritten by the kernel image, hence the need for moving them to a safe place, beyond where the uncompressed kernel image is loaded.  The actual load is slightly more complicated on x86 systems as not all BIOSs report their memory on the same registers, report information in different ways, or map their memory/system resources in unconventional ways. Also, some BIOSs must be prodded for information several times or have A20 Gate problems.

Other computer architectures may not have the limitations of the Intel x86 processor, and so loading the Linux kernel is done in a much more straightforward manner.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before we begin we should clarify the distinction between a “meta-purpose” and the “universal purpose” we have been seeking to guide our collective morality.

Part Three, ''Purpose'', sought evidence that the behaviour of the universe or life might be directed toward achieving some kind of purpose. It found none. It then suggested that (and proposed a reason why) life might continue evolving until it became an omnipotent being (but emphasized that there is no proof that this must occur).

Since the universe behaves rationally, life’s survival depends upon behaving rationally also. Sentient beings, able to plan ahead before acting, behave rationally when they pre-determine a purpose and make decisions that, when acted upon, help to achieve the chosen purpose.  We might decide that “supporting life’s journey to become omnipotent” is a worthy goal, and we could make it our “meta-purpose” to guide moral decision making. However, this is too loose a statement for many practical purposes. While it might convey some emotional desires or feelings, it is not precise enough.

A statement intended to guide the moral (and therefore physical) behaviour of an entire civilization must be able to withstand all manner of challenges—legalistic, moralistic, religious, economic, and many more. “Helping life to become oB” will never survive a rational attack; a more robust definition of humanity’s goal is required. A clearly defined “universal purpose,” possibly based upon the desire to help life evolve to become oB, could turn wishful conjecture into practical precision. Moreover, if a “universal purpose” were to be derived from the concept of assisting life to become oB, then a potentially dry legal document might come to life—the vision empowering the definition.

How a universal purpose might be defined is touched upon in the [[../Multi-year Targets/]]; it is difficult task but not one we need dwell upon. The question, “why bother to do anything?” is a much more important topic and must be addressed. Why should anyone go to the trouble of contemplating the precise wording of a universal purpose?

[[../Why Bother?/]] suggests some philosophical reasons why the effort should be made while [[../Possible Applications/]] offers some practical ones. Hopefully one or more of the thoughts expressed in those chapters convince at least a few readers that the undertaking would be well worth while.

[[../Determining Moral Behaviours/]] delves into the nitty gritty of a possible new morality. Assuming a universal purpose based upon the premise of oB was crafted, just what behaviours would it support, and what might it forbid?  Superior minds will hopefully someday undertake the task of developing a rational morality, one that might better guide us in solving the extraordinarily complex issues we face today and will surely encounter tomorrow.

In eras past, religions took generations to develop, with emotions playing a large part. Nowadays a sound religion might be rationally grown in a decade or two, via electronic communications. This book's emphasis is upon the need to develop a universal religion, and where one might look, not upon actually doing so. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to outline how such a fantasy might someday become a reality in [[../A Universal Religion/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter attempts to answer some of the questions skeptics may raise. It suggests a few philosophical reasons why we should develop a universal purpose, why we should base it upon supporting the achievement of life’s possible endpoint, and why we should make this effort. Other, more practical, reasons for developing a universal purpose are presented in the next chapter.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Purpose directs decision making. Even so, most of us start our careers and live our lives having no specific goal in mind. Perhaps as a consequence, many of us seem to actually like being told where we should be going and what we should be doing. We see this during election campaigns, and in the organizations we work for. We look for leaders with vision, people who can imagine possible futures, describe desirable ideals, then tell us how they might be achieved. We see it again in our religions: the current split between revision and tradition is all about direction. It is also pervasive in the advertisements that surround us; these wouldn’t be effective if we weren’t receptive to instruction and influence. Our willingness to accept direction in almost all walks of life suggests that many, if not most, may actually prefer to be told what to think, how to behave, and what to buy. Being told, I suppose, simplifies life.

If this is so, then perhaps the first reason why we should develop an overarching purpose is that the world today is arguably without united moral direction, and being in this position is disquieting. Religious dogmatists sense this void and are responding with an oft-surprising militancy. In that fundamentalism seeks to return us to the ways and notions of many centuries past, the possibility that a fundamentalist Protestant, Catholic, Islamist, or other extremist might generate enough support to globalize his or her religious views is rather alarming. Such an outcome would exclude the last thousand years’ of progress in all fields of knowledge, and spawn an oppressive future. The world is not what it used to be—it no longer naturally overflows with abundant resources, and a population of six billion can only be sustained using the products of modern technology.

There are additional good reasons to seek and select a guiding universal purpose. For instance, heads of governments and large multinational corporations make decisions that cross many boundaries, affect the lives of multitudes, and determine how vast resources are spent. In our current society, these decisions are usually made as though each was entirely unrelated to any kind of a broader picture. (Moreover, and this would be worse, the organization’s “bigger picture” could be completely at odds with the one that the majority of us would like to see.) If humanity’s goal for life is to be more than just wandering and squandering, exhausting the world’s resources toward trivial ends, perhaps even harming rather than helping our collective future,&lt;ref&gt;There are many examples of this: funding gigantic dams or re-directing rivers with disastrous results, financing governments that promote genocide, supporting dictators who are politically astute but morally bankrupt, depleting fish stocks to provide temporary jobs, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; then we must find a way to speak with a united voice.

Another, quite different, reason for individuals to adopt a universal purpose is that following one can provide an extra degree of personal meaning, something above and beyond that which we may already possess.

Fully one-fifth of the population (and, very probably, many more, once acknowledging ones adherence to atheism or agnosticism becomes acceptable in general society) openly states that they do not believe in the existence of a god who involves himself in the affairs of humankind. These individuals, and I am one of them, make moral decisions without referring to the guiding purpose a religion provides. Rather, we support a variety of purposes (commonly those that would be called moral or ethical) instead of just one: helping people or animals, working to improve communities or the environment, contributing to charities, and so on. Following such purposes and personally behaving in a manner consistent with these goals provides meaning. But none of these purposes, individually, can bring as much meaning as would following a single, all-encompassing, universal purpose—particularly one accepted and supported by the majority.

However, perhaps the most compelling reason to develop a universal purpose is that, for the first time in history, we now have the knowledge and power to direct our future by genetically manipulating life. This must not be allowed to happen haphazardly, driven this way or that by commercial or quasi-religious immoderates and their organizations, as such interventions represent the desires of only small portions of humankind. All must be heard in matters of such importance, for we are about to recreate ourselves in our own image.

This new-found ability was mentioned earlier, when we noted that survival has meant adapting to changes in the environment. In effect, life’s future used to be (and much still is) externally determined. But our human future is about to become whatever we decide to make it, and we must proceed with great care. One mistake, and we may produce a virus a thousandfold worse than smallpox or HIV. We may introduce factors that migrate between species,&lt;ref&gt;This may have already happened. It has been suggested that the AIDS virus may have been passed along in polio vaccines tested in central Africa in the late 1950s, because those vaccines were made from chimpanzee-kidney tissue which may have been contaminated with the chimpanzee precursor of the AIDS virus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The human version of mad cow disease might be considered to be another example. It was once found only within sheep, but then diseased sheep were made into cattle feed. Other examples (for example, genetically transformed fish and plants that later escaped to proliferate in the wild) were mentioned earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; or that mutate, then decimate entire biomes, and return life’s whole matrix to an ancestral form comprising little more than bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;This is a possible, if somewhat implausible, consequence of developing nanotechnological medical tools. Molecular-sized motors and circuits have been made in the laboratory. It is predicted that by the year 2020 we will have made machines a hundred times smaller than a pinhead, that can move within an animal’s body correcting ills, possibly extracting the energy to do so from fat molecules. Nanotech machines can be designed to self-replicate, and may be used to seek and destroy cancer cells. What if they mutated, replicated, and started consuming other kinds of molecules? How could they be contained?&lt;/ref&gt;

Our present and future actions in gene manipulation are fraught with danger, but they are also magnificently full of opportunities. We cannot ignore these technological and medical advances. We must learn fully the science of genetics, but we must also carefully control the use of what we learn. Only by everyone, at all levels of these endeavours, adopting, developing and maintaining a conscientious awareness of an appropriate humanity-guiding universal purpose, might this degree of control be achievable (a premise to be expanded upon in the next chapter).

The concerned rational among us must be the ones to take the initiative. We should adopt or define a judicious guiding purpose while we may, or in its absence someone will certainly come along and sell us theirs and it may become too late to make a rational choice. History provides us with many examples of this. Whenever we have found ourselves greatly dissatisfied, as a group or as a nation, someone offers leadership, then takes command. This is how Stalin, Hitler, Yeltsin, Milošević, and Bin Laden gained or consolidated their power, to name just a few examples from recent history.

Humanity needs, I think, a collective purpose. This would be ''in addition'' to our many individual and religious purposes. Under such a unified objective, individual moral behaviour not harmful to the collective good would properly remain individual choice, accruing concomitant rewards as believed to come before or after that individual’s death. However, the world’s collective guidance is a different matter. It should be obtained from a purpose positioned far beyond any one individual’s reach. This purpose should shine as a beacon to nations, guiding many generations. And its rewards should accrue to the living, not the dead, enriching the lives of all.

While no one should be expected to abandon their inherited or chosen religion, none should be prevented from adopting an additional universal purpose to guide their moral behaviour. No one should be asked to change what they have come to believe about themselves and their ultimate individual destiny, or to deny the god they worship. But an overarching universal purpose, used to guide humanity’s collective behaviour should also exist—something that clearly helps ensure our species’ and life’s well-being and continuance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Orderings ==

===Definitions===

Relations with certain properties that impose a notion of order on a set are known as '''order relations''' or simply '''orderings'''. For the following definitions, let ''R'' be a ''binary relation''.

*If ''R'' is ''reflexive'' and ''transitive'', then it is known as a '''preorder'''.
*If ''R'' is a ''preorder'' and also ''antisymmetric'', then it is known as a '''partial order'''.
*If ''R'' is a ''partial order'' and also ''total'', then it is known as a '''total order''' or a '''linear order'''.

A set equipped with a ''preorder'', ''partial order'', or ''total order'' is known as a '''preordered set''', '''partially ordered set''' (or '''poset'''), or '''totally ordered set''' (or '''linearly ordered set''') respectively. An order relation is usually denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; and an ordered set is denoted by the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;( S , \le )&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; is the order relation on ''S''.

A ''totally ordered'' subset of a ''partially ordered'' set is known as a '''chain'''. For this reason, any totally ordered set may sometimes be referred to as a ''chain''.

Two elements ''a'' and ''b'' in a ''preordered'' (and thus in a ''partially'' or ''totally'' ordered) set are called '''comparable''' if either &lt;math&gt;a \le b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b \le a&lt;/math&gt;. Note that while ''totality'' guarantees that every two elements in a ''totally'' ordered set are comparable, two elements in a ''pre'' or ''partially'' ordered set may not be so.

=== Bounds ===

Let &lt;math&gt;(S, \le)&lt;/math&gt; be a preordered set and let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists an element &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \le u&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in T&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''upper bound''' for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, if there exists an element &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;l \le x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in T&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is a '''lower bound''' for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists an upper bound for a set then that set is said to be '''bounded above''', or similarly if there is a lower bound then the set is '''bounded below'''.

Let &lt;math&gt;(P, \le)&lt;/math&gt; be a partially ordered set and let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. If an element &lt;math&gt;u \in P&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;u \le z&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is an upper bound for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''least upper bound''' or '''supremum''' of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, a lower bound of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; that is greater than or equal to every other lower bound for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  is the '''greatest lower bound''' or '''infimum''' of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. The following proposition states that we are justified in calling these elements ''the'' supremum or infimum rather than just ''a'' supremum or infimum. The proof is left to the reader.

'''Proposition:''' The supremum and infimum of a set are each unique.

Let &lt;math&gt;(P, \le)&lt;/math&gt; be a partially ordered set and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a subset of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. A '''maximal element''' of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is any element &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;m \le a&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;m = a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a \in T&lt;/math&gt;. If the inequality in the previous sentence is reversed, then the element is called a '''minimal element'''. If &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt; is greater than every other element in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the '''greatest element''' or '''maximum''', and similarly if it is less than every other element it is the '''least element''' or '''minimum'''. Note that an element of a partially ordered set can be a maximal element while failing to be a maximum since not all elements of a partially ordered set may be comparable.

== Equivalences ==

Another important type of relation is the '''equivalence relation'''. This is a relation ''R'' that is ''reflexive'', ''symmetric'', and ''transitive'' (or, simply a preorder that is also ''symmetric''). When ''R'' is an equivalence relation, we usually denote it by &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;. A set equipped with an equivalence relation is also known as a '''setoid'''.

If &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we define for an element &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt; the '''equivalence class''' of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\{a \in S : a \sim s\}&lt;/math&gt;. This is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;[s]&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''quotient set''' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;S/\!\sim\ = \{[x] : x \in S\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

A '''partition''' of a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a family of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}&lt;/math&gt; is pairwise disjoint and &lt;math&gt;\bigcup \mathfrak{S} = S&lt;/math&gt;. The proof of the following theorems about equivalence relations are left to the reader.

'''Theorem:''' If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S/\!\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; a partition of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Define a relation &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; such that for &lt;math&gt;a, b \in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a \star b&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if there exists a member of P which contains both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation.

== The Strengths Perspective ==
=== What Is It? ===

* Strengths-Based Practice assesses the inherent strengths of a person or family, then builds on them.

* Strengths Based practice uses peoples' personal strengths to aid in recovery and empowerment.
(Fort Wayne MSW class, December 2006.  Class discussion.)

* It's really about reframing personal perception to find good even in the worst situation.

=== Why Use It? ===
* It is an empowering alternative to traditional therapies which typically describe family functioning in terms of psychiatric diagnoses or deficits.

* It avoids the use of stigmatizing language or terminology which families use on themselves and eventually identify with, accept, and feel helpless to change.

* It is at odds with the &quot;victim identity&quot; -- epitomized in popular culture by the appearance of individuals on television or talk radio sharing intimate details of their problems—which is inherently self-defeating.
 
* It fosters hope by focusing on what is or has been historically successful for the person, thereby exposing precedent successes as the groundwork for realistic expectations.

* It inventories (often for the first time in the person's experience) the positive building blocks that already exist in his/her environment that can serve as the foundation for growth and change.
 
* It reduces the power and authority barrier between the person and therapist by promoting the person to the level of expert in regards to what has worked, what does not work, and what might work in their situation.

* It reduces the power and authority barrier between person and therapist by placing the therapist in the role of partner or guide.

* Families are more invested in any process where they feel they are an integral part.

* And lastly - it works.

=== Implications for Practice ===
 
Therapists (and other health professionals, like physicians) are often comfortable and confident in their role as expert.  Effective strengths-based practice requires that we acknowledge that in the life of the people we work with, we are not yet significant. Ideally, in the long run, we will not have an ongoing significant role in their lives- we will empower them to be the experts. However, we can help by locating and integrating those who are significant into the helping process.  

More importantly, we must change the way we perceive, and the way we speak.  Stigmatizing labels and personal behavior descriptors must be avoided:

* non-compliant
* resistive
* unwilling to change
* unmotivated
* poor insight
* uncooperative
* dysfunctional
* oppositional
* defiant
* delinquent

Additionally, never refer to the person by his or her diagnosis.  Describing someone as a &quot;schizophrenic&quot; is no different from referring to another person as &quot;cancerous&quot;.  A person is not their illness—a person is a person, with a physical or psychiatric problem.

== Strengths-Based Assessment ==
=== Perception ===

Sometimes, the magnitude or volume of problems troubling an individual or family is overwhelming—to therapists and individuals alike.  When your initial impression of another person's situation is &quot;train wreck&quot;, how can you proceed in choosing areas for initial development, and defining realistic goals?  For yourself, and for the people you are assisting, it is important to begin the process with a positive vision. 
 
Wherever there is a problem in the person/family, look for the inherent strengths that can be used as a starting point for further growth.  Never practice strengths-based perception to the extreme of ignoring dangerous situations, but do focus on creating a valid inventory of positive characteristics that are the foundation of the work you will do together.

=== Life Domain Guided Assessment ===

A useful and visually powerful assessment exercise involves the brainstorming and posting of client/family strengths on a wall, on a pyramid made of different facets (or life domains) of the person/family and their environment.  The pyramid has several levels.

* FAMILY VISION

* ATTITUDES &amp; VALUES, PREFERENCES, SKILLS &amp; ABILITIES, ATTRIBUTES &amp; FEATURES

* Vocational, Educational, Legal, Financial, Social &amp; Recreational  and Logistical

* Crisis &amp; Safety, Home &amp; A Place to Live, Family &amp; Relationships, Spiritual &amp; Cultural, Health &amp; Medical, Mental Health

You may wish to make letter-sized signs—one with each of these domains listed—then laminate them and arrange them on a wall in your office or group therapy room.  Arrange the signs in a roughly pyramid shape starting with the top domain (Family Vision):
&lt;center&gt;
X

X   X   X   X

X   X   X   X   X 

X   X   X   X   X   X
&lt;/center&gt;

This process is a challenge to both individuals and therapists, a fact that clearly illustrates the pervasive influence of deficit-based assessment and labeling in how therapists perceive individuals, and how individuals perceive themselves.  

Take heart—it gets easier with repeated use—and eventually it will be routine to generate fifty or one hundred positive aspects of a person or a family in their present environment.

=== Self Assessment ===

It is also useful to provide people or families with self-assessment tools, and for those who feel pressured or embarrassed by the Life Domain Assessment, this may be a better fit.  In two or three pages, try to elicit background information and basic goals from your new client.  Keep the wording simple.

The following sample questions might be given to the parent/guardian of a child with bipolar disorder, or another emotional handicap:

* List the three most distressing problems you are having with your child/family.
* What seems to help, even if doesn't solve the problem?
* What things does you child enjoy doing?
* What talents or skills does your child have?
* List some positive things about your family.
* What are your dreams and future plans for your child?
* What does your family hope to achieve in the next month?
* What does your family hope to achieve this year?
* If you had all the money and support you needed, what would you change about your family's situation?
* Apart from your immediate family, list by name the most important people in your child's life (examples: teachers, coaches, friends, neighbors, clergy, health professionals, etc.).
* When are the best times for you, your family, and other important people to meet with us to plan and discuss as a team?

=== Exercises ===
''List the strengths of these individuals and their family systems, speculating as appropriate.''

==== Scenario 1: Phil ====

Phil is 16 years old, and the oldest of 4 children.  He attends school regularly but doesn't do much homework, and does assignments at the last minute.  His grades are B's and C's.  Phil is very quiet but has half a dozen friends.  He plays in a garage band with a few guys he knows from school.  Phil rarely smiles.  He has a weekend job, but often does not return home after getting off work.  Usually, he goes straight over to the home of a friend who is two years older.  There, he is allowed to drink as much beer and hard liquor as he wants.  He gets very drunk each time and usually spends the night sleeping on the floor, or on the couch if it is available.  He's driven home drunk once.  Phil sometimes cries when he is drunk, saying he hates how his life is and wishes he were dead.  He complains that his parents scream and fight too much, and it's easier to stay out of the house and avoid the chaos.  Phil hopes to be an architect someday and takes drafting in school. Phil's problem basically stems from home whereby his parents fight most of the time, however despite that Phil still has visions and dreams. therefore, further interventions should focus on the strengths recognized from Phil and also provide family therapy to try and remedy the situation at home.

==== Scenario 2: Rachel ====
Rachel is 11 years old, but already has a reputation at school about her interest in boys, despite never having had a boyfriend (or at least one her own age).  She is a good student.  Her father is employed by the school and even the students are aware of a rumor that he is having an affair with another staff member.  Rachel has a number of friends, but all except one are boys.  She often invites people over, but never to her bedroom.  Instead, she prefers to hang out in her brother Seth's bedroom (he is rarely home).  The room is littered with erotic magazines, liquor containers, and smells like cigarettes and something else.  Rachel says the 'other smell' is pot.  Rachel's mother never comes down to see what she is up to, and rarely greets her friends, despite usually being home.  Her father is often away, and it's difficult to know when he is at home because he gives the children a wide berth.  Seth hosts drinking parties at the house regularly, where marijuana is smoked freely, and no-one has ever objected to Rachel inviting her own friends.  Recently, one of her friends from school died in an accident.  Rachel only remarked that is was a shame that he died a virgin.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;





== Satisfaction and validity of formulae ==

=== Satisfaction ===

Inn sentential logic, an interpretation under which a formula is true is said to ''satisfy'' that formula.  In predicate logic, the notion of satisfaction is a bit more complex.  A formula is ''satisfiable'' if and only if it is true under at least one interpretation (that is, if and only if at least one interpretation satisfies the formula).  The example truth table of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Truth Tables|Truth Tables]] showed that the following sentence is satisfiable.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})&lt;/math&gt;

For a simpler example, the formula &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable because it is true under any interpretation that assigns &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the value True.

We can use the following convenient notation to say that the interpretation &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; satisfies (or does not satisfy) &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}\ \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}\ \not\vDash\,\ \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


We can extend the notion of satisfaction to sets of formulae.  A set of formulae is satisfiable if and only if there is an interpretation under which every formula of the set is true (that is, the interpretation satisfies every formula of the set).

A formula is ''unsatisfiable'' if and only if there is no interpretation under which it is true.  A trivial example is

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \and \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

You can easily confirm by doing a truth table that the formula is false no matter what truth value an interpretation assigns to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We say that an unsatisfiable formula is ''logically false''.  One can say that an unsatisfiable formula of sentential logic (but not one of predicate logic) is tautologically false.

=== Validity ===

A formula is ''valid'' if and only if it is satisfied under every interpretation.  For example,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \or \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is valid.  You can easily confirm by a truth table that it is true no matter what the interpretation assigns to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We say that a vaild sentence is ''logically true''.  We call a valid formula of sentential logic&amp;mdash;but not one of predicate logic&amp;mdash;a ''tautology''.

We can use the following convenient notation to say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is (or is not) valid.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\not\vDash\,\ \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Equivalence ===

Two formulae are ''equivalent'' if and only if they are true under exactly the same interpretations.  You can easily confirm by truth table that any interpretation that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In addition, any interpretation that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus they are equivalent.

We can use the following convenient notation to say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent.

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is true if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ (\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Validity of arguments ==

An ''argument'' is a set of formulae designated as ''premises'' together with a single sentence designated as the ''conclusion''.  Intuitively, we want the premises jointly to constitute a reason to believe the conclusion.  For our purposes an argument is ''any'' set of premises together with ''any'' conclusion.  That can be a bit artificial for some particularly silly arguments, but the logical properties of an argument do not depend on whether it is silly or whether anyone actually does or might consider the premises to be a reason to believe the conclusion.  We consider arguments ''as if'' one does or might consider the premises to be a reason for the conclusion independently of whether anyone actually does or might do so.  Even an empty set of premises together with a conclusion counts as an argument.

The following examples show the same argument using several notations.

: Example 1
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: Therefore &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Example 2
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;big&gt;'''&amp;there4;'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Example 3
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: Example 4
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P},\ \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


An argument is valid if and only if every interpretation that satisfies all the premises also satisfies the conclusion.  A conclusion of a valid argument is a ''logical consequence'' of its premises.  We can express the validity (or invalidity) of the argument with &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as its set of premises and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as its conclusion using the following notation.

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vDash \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\ \not\vDash\ \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For example, we have

: &lt;math&gt;\{\mathrm{P},\ \mathrm{P}\rightarrow\mathrm{Q}\}\ \vDash\ \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Validity for arguments, or logical consequence, is the central notion driving the intuitions on which we build a logic.  We want to know whether our arguments are good arguments, that is, whether they represent good reasoning.  We want to know whether the premises of an argument constitute good reason to believe the conclusion.  Validity is one essential feature of a good argument.  It is not the only essential feature.  A valid argument with at least one false premise is useless.  Validity is the truth-preserving feature.  It does not tell us that the conclusion is true, only that the logical features of the argument are such that, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is.  A valid argument with true premises is ''sound''.

There are other less formal features that a good argument needs.  Just because the premises are true does not mean that they are believed, that we have any reason to believe them, or that we could collect evidence for them.  It should also be noted that validity only applies to certain types of arguments, particularly ''deductive'' arguments.  Deductive arguments are intended to be valid.  The archetypical example for a deductive argument is a mathematical proof.  Inductive arguments, of which scientific arguments provide the archetypical example, are not intended to be valid.  The truth of the premises are not intended to guarantee that the conclusion is true.  Rather, the truth of the premises are intended to make the truth of the conclusion highly probably or likely.  In science, we do not intend to offer mathematical proofs.  Rather, we gather evidence.

== Formulae and arguments ==

For every valid formula, there is a corresponding valid argument having the valid formula as its conclusion and the empty set as its set of premises.  Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;\varnothing \vDash \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


For every valid argument with finitely many premises, there is a corresponding valid formula.  Consider a valid argument with &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the conclusion and having as its premises &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, \varphi_2, ..., \varphi_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Then

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1,\ \varphi_2,\ ...,\ \varphi_n \vDash \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There is then the corresponding valid formula

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1 \land \varphi_2 \land ... \land \varphi_n \rightarrow \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There corresponds to the valid argument

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P},\ \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&amp;there4;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the following valid formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Implication ==

You may see some text reading our arrow &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as 'implies' and using 'implications' as an alternative for 'conditional'.  This is generally decried as a use-mention error.  In ordinary English, the following are considered grammatically correct:

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 'That there is smoke implies that there is fire'.
: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 'There is smoke' implies 'there is fire'.

In (3), we have one fact or proposition or whatever (the current favorite among philosophers appears to be proposition) implying another of the same species.  In (4), we have one sentence implying another.

But the following is considered incorrect:

: There is smoke implies there is fire.

Here, in contrast to (3), there are no quotation marks.  Nothing is the subject doing the implying and nothing is the object implied.  Rather, we are composing a larger sentence out of smaller ones as if 'implies' were a grammatical conjunction such as 'only if'.

Thus logicians tend to avoid using 'implication' to mean ''conditional''.  Rather, they use 'implies' to mean ''has as a logical consequence'' and 'implication' to mean ''valid argument''.  In doing this, they are following the model of (4) rather than (3).  In particular, they read (1) and (2) as '&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; implies (or does not imply) &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
