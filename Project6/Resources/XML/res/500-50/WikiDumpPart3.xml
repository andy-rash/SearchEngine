The motor effect is the term used when a current-carrying wire in the presence of a magnetic field experiences a force. A simple experimental demonstration will show you that this is true.

Place a wire that is connected to a power pack in between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. Turn on the power and the wire moves. Often the movement is only very slight because a typical horseshoe magnet is not very strong.

The force depends on a number of things:
*How strong the magnetic field is inside the loop of the magnetic coil as it is usually iron and iron is a good conductor of magnetic attraction.(B)
*How much current is flowing through the wire. (I)
*The angle formed between the wire and the direction of the magnetic field.(θ)
*The length of the wire, carrying the current, in the magnetic field.(l)

The force obeys the formula: F=lBISinθ

The first two points are pretty much obvious, so let's look at the third point in a little more detail. The magnetic field of a horseshoe magnet points pretty much in a straight line from the north pole to the south pole.  If the wire cuts this field at right angles the resulting force will be a maximum. If the wire runs parallel to the field, from the north the south pole or vice versa, the wire will still experience the motor effect. However, the net result of this force is along the wire, not perpendicular to it, thus the wire does not turn.

Having said that, at GCSE you only really need to think about situations where the field and the wire cut each other at right angles. The force is always at right angles to both the field and the current flowing in the wire. This means that if you draw the direction of the magnetic field and the wire on a piece of paper the force will be out of the plane of the paper pointing straight up or down {More about how you work out which way later).

[[Image:The motor effect.png]]

Look at the diagram above. For simplicity, only the two ends of the horseshoe magnet have been drawn. Also the power pack and connecting wires are not shown either. The magnetic field is going into the screen. The current is traveling from right to left. The black line represents the force, and therefore the direction that the wire moves.

*'''Q1)''' Name one way that the force on the wire could be increased.
*'''Q2)''' Name as many ways as you can to reduce the force on the wire.
*'''Q3)'''  Name two ways of reversing the force on the wire, so that it pushes the wire up rather than down.

==Fleming's Left Hand Rule== 


[[Image:Hand (motor effect).png]]

This rule allows you to work out which direction the force will point in. Arrange your left hand with your thumb, first finger, and second fingers all pointing at right angles to one another. 

*Point your &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; '''F&lt;/font&gt;'''irst finger in the direction of the magnetic &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;''' field'''&lt;/font&gt;.
*Point your '''Se&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;C&lt;/font&gt;ond''' finger in the direction of the &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; '''current'''&lt;/font&gt;.
*The &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt; '''Th'''&lt;/font&gt;umb will then give you the direction of the '''force''' (&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''thrust'''&lt;/font&gt;).

Remember you have to use your left hand for this! Although you may use your right hand so long as you swap the direction of current with the force

'''Q4)''' A student uses her right hand instead of her left. What effect will that have on the force she works out?

You will recall that a current carrying wire is surrounded by its own magnetic field. The diagram below shows the wire end on in a magnetic field of two magnets that are NS facing. The field due to the magnets is shown in blue, and the field due to the current in the wire is shown in black.

[[Image:Motor effect 1.png]]

Notice the direction of the two fields as shown by the arrows. On top of the wire the fields are both going in the same direction. They add up making an overall strong field. 

Underneath the wire, they go in opposite directions. They cancel each other out to some extent making an overall weaker field. The new field is shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:Motor effect 2.png]]

See how the field above the wire is stronger. The lines are closer together. Below the wire the field is weaker (due to partial canceling out) the field lines are further apart. The force pushes the wire downwards, away from the strong field into the weak field. It's as if the field lines try to repel each other. They don't like being squashed together and try to straighten out. They also act as if they are made of elastic bands, they don't like being stretched out of shape. (This is just a model of what's going on. The lines aren't real, they don't actually try to push each other away, but I find it a way of helping me understand what's going on. If it doesn't help you, don't use it)

*'''Q5)''' Use the idea of field lines not liking being squashed together to explain why two magnets with like poles facing each other repel.
*'''(Q6)''' Use the idea of field lines being made of elastic to explain why two magnets with opposite poles facing attract one another.

==A simple electric motor==

Ok, so far we have been looking at the force that results when we put a current carrying wire in a magnetic field. In this section we will look at a practical use for this force.As you have probably already guessed from the name of this page, the practical use is going to be an electric motor.

[[Image:Simplified_electric_motor.png]]

Look at the diagram above. A  rectangular loop of wire is sitting inside a magnetic field. We can consider the current in the four sections of the loop and work out which way the force acts.
*On the left hand side of the loop the current is flowing ''into'' the page or screen. The magnetic field will be going from left to right so from Flemming's left hand rule the force will be downwards.
*On the back and front of the loops the current is parallel to the magnetic field so there is ''zero'' force.
*On the right hand side of the loop the current is coming ''out'' of the page or screen. The field is still going from left to right so the force will be upwards.

The net result of these different forces is that there will be a turning moment that makes the coil rotate by 90&amp;deg;. At that point the upwards and downwards forces will be acting along the same line and the coil will stop turning. Another way to think about it is to consider the loop as a tiny little one turn solenoid. The solenoid will have a little north pole and a little south pole and will therefore move until its north pole lines up with the south pole of the magnet on the right, and its south pole lines up with the north pole of  magnet on the left.

This is all very interesting but not much use as a motor. We want something that keeps turning all the time the current flows. They way this is achieved is by the use of the commutator - a circular metal ring that is split into two halves. The ends of the wire loop turn around inside the commutator. They are in electrical contact with it. One side of the commutator is connected to the positive output of a power pack or battery . the other half of the commutator is connected to the negative.

Let's look at what happens as the coil turns inside the commutator:
#The coil turns clockwise because of the forces on the two halves as explained above. 
#As the coil turns the wires slip around on the inside of the commutator.
#When the coil is in a vertical position there is no force on it, but its momentum carries it forward a little.
#The wires inside the commutator make contact with the other half of the ring. I.e. the wire that was in contact with the positive half of the commutator now touches the negative half and vice versa.
#This causes the current to flow the other way around the coil, which reverses the little solenoid magnet.
#The coil therefore tries to line itself up with the magnetic field by continuing to turn so that it ultimately points in the other direction. 
#Once the coil is vertical, and facing the other way, the wires touch their original halves of the commutator. and the whole cycle repeats over and over

'''Q7)'''A student sets up an electric motor and turns it on. The coil turns clockwise. List two ways she could reverse the direction.

{{move|C Programming/Structures}}

In the section [[C Programming/Types|C types]] we looked at some basic types. However '''C complex types''' allow us greater flexibility in managing data in our C program.

== Data structures ==

A data structure (&quot;struct&quot;) contains multiple pieces of data.
Each piece of data (called a &quot;member&quot;) can be accessed by the name of the variable, followed by a '.', then the name of the member.
(Another way to access a member is using the member operator '-&gt;').
The member variables of a struct can be of any data type and can even be an array or a pointer.


=== Structs ===

A data structure contains multiple pieces of data.
One defines a data structure using the &lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. For example,

    '''struct''' mystruct
    {
        int int_member;
        double double_member;
        char string_member[25];
    } variable;

&lt;tt&gt;variable&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance of &lt;tt&gt;mystruct&lt;/tt&gt;. You can omit it from the end of the &lt;tt&gt;'''struct'''&lt;/tt&gt; declaration and declare it later using:
 '''struct''' mystruct variable;

It is often common practice to make a ''type synonym'' so we don't have to type &quot;struct mystruct&quot; all the time. C allows us the possibility to do so using a &lt;tt&gt;'''typedef'''&lt;/tt&gt; statement, which aliases a type:
 '''typedef''' '''struct'''
 {
   ...
 } Mystruct;
The &lt;tt&gt;'''struct'''&lt;/tt&gt; itself has no name (by the absence of a name on the first line), but it is aliased as &lt;tt&gt;Mystruct&lt;/tt&gt;. Then you can use
 Mystruct structure;

Note that it is commonplace, and good style to capitalize the '''first letter''' of a type synonym. However in the actual definition we need to give the struct a ''tag'' so we can refer to it: we may have a ''recursive data structure'' of some kind. For trees or chained lists, we need a pointer to the same data type in the struct. During compilation, the type synonym is not known to the compiler and there will be an error. To avoid this, it is necessary to let the compiler know the name right from the start (Note that the '''struct''' keyword is used ''only'' inside the structure! After the declaration, the compiler ''knows'' that the type synonym refers to a '''struct'''):
 '''typedef''' '''struct''' Mystruct
 {
   ...
   '''struct''' Mystruct * pMystruct
 } Mystruct;
&lt;!-- Am I the only one that finds this paragraph confusing ? --&gt;

=== Unions ===

The definition of a union is similar to that of a struct.  The difference between the two is that in a struct, the members occupy different areas of memory, but in a union, the members occupy the same area of memory.  Thus, in the following type, for example:

 union {
     int i;
     double d;
 } u;

The programmer can access either &lt;code&gt;u.i&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;u.d&lt;/code&gt;, but not both at the same time. Since &lt;code&gt;u.i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;u.d&lt;/code&gt; occupy the same area of memory, modifying one modifies the value of the other, sometimes in unpredictable ways.

The size of a union is the size of its largest member.

== Type modifiers ==

For &quot;register&quot;, &quot;volatile&quot;, &quot;auto&quot; and &quot;extern&quot;, see [[../Variables#Other_Modifiers]].

      <comment>/* Review of logs */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Review of logs=
Been a while since you used logs? Here is a quick refresher for you.

The log (short for logarithm) of a number N is the exponent used to raise a certain &quot;base&quot; number B to get N.  In short, &lt;math&gt;\log_B\ N = x&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;B^x = N&lt;/math&gt;.

Typically, logs use base 10. An increase of &quot;1&quot; in a base 10 log is equivalent to an increase by a power of 10 in normal notation. In logs, &quot;3&quot; is 100 times the size of &quot;1&quot;.  If the log is
written without an explicit base, 10 is (usually) implied.

{| WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;
|-style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
|&lt;math&gt;y=10^x\ \mathrm{or}\ \log_{10}y=x\ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|''therefore:''	log(10&lt;sup&gt;–12&lt;/sup&gt;) = –12 &lt;br&gt;
|-
|''also:''       log(1000) = 3'''
|}


Another common base for logs is the trancendental number &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, which is approximately 2.7182818....  Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x&lt;/math&gt;, these can be more convenient than &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}&lt;/math&gt;.  Often, the notation &lt;math&gt;\ln\ x&lt;/math&gt; is used instead of
&lt;math&gt;\log_e\ x&lt;/math&gt;.

The following properties of logs are true regardless of whether the base is 10, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;,
or some other number.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;big&gt;
logA + logB = log(AB)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
logA – logB = log(A/B)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
log(A&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;) = B log(A)'''
&lt;/big&gt;
|}

&lt;br&gt;
Adding the log of A to the log of B will give the same result as taking the log of the product A times B.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Subtracting the log of B from the log of A will give the same result as taking the log of the quotient A divided by B.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The log of (A to the Bth power) is equal to the product (B times the log of A).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A few examples:
&lt;br&gt;
log(2) + log(3) = log(6)
&lt;br&gt;
log(30) – log(2) = log(15)
&lt;br&gt;
log(8) = log(2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 3log(2)

Electricity acts as if all matter were divided into four categories:

#Superconductors, which allow current to flow with no resistance. (However these have only been produced in relatively extreme laboratory conditions, such as at temperatures approaching absolute zero)
#Conductors, which allow electric current to flow with little resistance.
#Semiconductors, which allow some electric current to flow but with significant resistance.
#Insulators, which do not allow electric current to flow.

Charges are positive (+) or negative (-). Any two like charges repel each other, and opposite charges attract each other.

==Electric fields==

A charge in an electrical field feels a force. The charge is not a vector, but force is a vector, and so is the electric field. If a charge is positive, then force and the electric field point in the same direction. If the charge is negative, then the electric field and force vectors point in opposite directions.

A point charge in space causes an electric field. The field is stronger closer to the point and weaker farther away.

Electricity is made of subatomic particles called Electrons and so are Electric Fields and Magnetic Fields. One must also note that electrical fields come under the category of spherical fields as the inverse square law may be applied to the electrical field. This means that the electrical force, exhibited by the electrical field emitted by the subatomic electron charge (-), acting upon a body is inversely proportional to the distance between the center point of the electric field (subatomic electron) and the body on which the electric force is acting upon. 

An electric circuit is composed of conducting wires (through which an electric current flows through), a key or switch which is utilized to open and close the circuit, components which transfer electrical energy to a form of energy required by the component and an electromotive source (such as a voltaic cell).
A voltaic cell is an electromotive source in which are present two plates, zinc and copper, placed in dilute sulphuric acid. Whence the circuit is closed the zinc reacts with the sulphuric acid to produce zinc sulphate. The electromotive force which discharges the electrical energy in the electric current is considered to be originated on the surface of the zinc plate in the voltaic cell. However, depending upon the cell, closing the circuit gives rise to polarization, accumulation of hydrogen bubbles on the surface of the copper plate which seriously interferes with the movement of electricity and reduces the magnitude of the electromotive force. For this reason Leclanché cells are utilized. Consisting of similar characteristics as that of the voltaic cell however a Mage difference is present. Instead of the use of copper plates, a carbon plate is used. For this reason, magneze dioxide may be placed on the carbon to react to form a compound which whence in contact with hydrogen bubbles will turn the hydrogen into water, hence increasing the size of the electromotive force produced by the cell. 
The resistance encountered in conducting wires:
Inversely proportional to the diameter of the conducting wire.
Directly proportional to the length of the conducting wire.
Varies with different substances.
Varies with temperature of the conducting wire.

In order to maintain a constant flow of an electric current a constant expenditure of chemical or mechanical energy is required.
An electric current is accompanied by an electric field and a magnetic field. 
A device employed into determining the presence of an electric current is known as a galvanoscope. The conducting wire hriugh which the electric current flows through is he led over and parallel to the galvanoscope the magnetoscope preset inside of the galvanoscope being deflected in the opposite direction to which the electric current flows in. So with the aid of a galvanoscope one may not only deduce the magnetic properties of an electric current, the exhibition of a magnetic field, but the direction in which the current flows through. An electromotive force may also be generators by a dynamo. A rotating magnet present inside of a helix. The magnetic properties of electric currents may be used to construct magnets. An electomagnet is commonly described as a mass of iron on which is placed a helix/solenoid through which flows an electric current. The magnetic field emitted by the electric current is increased if the solenoid is placed around a magnetic mass of iron or any other substance possessing magnetic properties, that is the magnetic field of the iron is added to that of the electic current producing a more powerful magnetic field. 
Conductors may be arranged in two variants. Series and parallel circuits. In series, the current passes through each conductor in turn, where Ohm's law changes to I = nE/(nr + R), where I is the current intensity, n is the number of cells arranged in series in the circuit, E is the electromotive force applied to the circuit, r is the internal resistance ( the resistance the current that is produced in the cell experiences whence passing from the zinc plate to the copper or carbon plate through the sulphuric acid ) and R is the external resistance.

 zo        ZO       1-word quote
                    quote next word only; quotes a single Lojban word
                    (not a cmavo compound or tanru)



 ma        KOhA7    sumti ?
                    pro-sumti: sumti question (what/who/how/why/etc.);
                    appropriately fill in sumti blank



 la        LA       that named
                    name descriptor: the one(s) called ... ; takes name
                    or selbri description



 mi        KOhA3    me
                    pro-sumti: me/we the speaker(s)/author(s); identified
                    by self-vocative

===doi===
{doi} works like vocatives like {coi}. A speaker or author tells who they want to listen or read after this word. {do} stands for the listener.

In English poetry sometimes people say O before names, but usually people just put the name at the beginning or the end of a sentence separated from the rest by a comma or as a sentence of its own. In English, people also say &quot;Hey&quot; before names. This carries the added effect of getting someone's attention.

If I felt like saying something completely useless, I would say {doi do}, identifying the listener as the person listening.

''Can someone say {doi} by itself (without a name following like I can with the rest of the vocatives)?''

===coi===
Near the beginning of a conversation or upon noticing another Lojban speaker to talk to, a Lojban speaker will often say {coi}. The listener usually replies {coi}.

This has about the same meaning as the English words &quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Howdy&quot;, and &quot;Greetings&quot;. As with most of the vocatives, I can follow it with a name. It must either have la or a mandatory pause between {coi} and the name.

A common Lojban phrase {coi ro do} means &quot;Hi, all.&quot;.

{coinai} means the opposite of {coi}, and therefore &quot;goodbye&quot;, but most people say {co'o} to express that thought.

===be'e===
A Lojban speaker not speaking, wanting to speak, and not sure if other speakers will allow him/her to speak will sometimes say {be'e} to ask permission.

In English, people usually only ask to speak on formal occasions like the courtroom and in large meetings. In school students raise their hands for a turn to speak. When people say &quot;Excuse me.&quot;, they don't expect someone to deny them from speaking. They also ask &quot;May I have a word with you?&quot; Like most vocatives, I can follow {be'e} with the listener.

While I see {be'enai} as correct grammar, I can't figure out a meaning for it beyond &quot;Ha ha, I know a cmavo you don't!&quot;

''To me, {be'enai} seems fairly obvious: &quot;Permission not to speak?&quot; which could be used in a fairly similar way to &quot;No comment!&quot; but asking permission not to comment rather than refusing.''

===je'e===
{je'e} acknowledges that the speaker heard and understands the last utterance. As with most vocatives, I can follow {je'e} and {je'enai} with the name of the listener.

In English, people acknowledge &quot;Thank you.&quot;, with &quot;Welcome.&quot;. They say &quot;I heard.&quot; to acknowledge they heard the last utterance. They say &quot;I understand.&quot; To point out they understand the last utterance. &quot;Okay.&quot; also acknowledges the last utterance, but carries more hint of agreement than {je'e}. To show that nearly anyone would understand an utterance, English speakers sometimes use the word &quot;Duh!&quot;.

{je'enai} means the opposite of {je'e}. It means &quot;I did not hear and/or I did not understand.&quot;

In English people say &quot;Huh?&quot; or &quot;Wha?&quot; or &quot;What?&quot; to denote similar meanings.

===co'o===
A Lojban speaker says {co'o} to another Lojban speaker shortly before ending conversation or close proximity to the second Lojban speaker. The second Lojban speaker often replies {co'o}. As with most other vocatives, I can follow {co'o} with a name.

English phrases with similar meanings include &quot;Goodbye.&quot;, &quot;So long.&quot;, and &quot;See you later.&quot;.

{co'onai} means the opposite of {co'o}, but Lojban speakers seem to prefer {coi} to express this meaning nearly unanimously. I like {coi} better because it has two less syllables.

===re'i===
This word signifies that the speaker can listen to the listener. I can
follow {re'i} with a name like most vocatives to signify the listener.

English phrases with similar meanings include &quot;Go ahead.&quot;, &quot;I'm all ears.&quot;, and &quot;I'm listening.&quot;

la daniel. cusku zo be'e .i la kleir. cusku zo re'i
Daniel says, &quot;May I have a word with you?&quot;. Claire says, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;.

{re'inai} means the opposite of {re'i}. Therefore it means the speaker cannot listen to the listener.

In English {re'inai} translate to &quot;Sorry, I'm busy.&quot;, &quot;I'm not accepting visitors.&quot;, and &quot;I can't listen right now.&quot;

===zo===
{zo} quotes the next word. By quoting the next word, a speaker can refer to a word as a word instead of as its meaning. {zo broda} has about the same meaning as {lu broda li'u}, but {zo} can only quote one word.

In English, I might put a word in quotes italics to quote it. If I only wanted to quote one word, I might say &quot;the word foo&quot;.

I can talk about the word {zo} as a word by saying {zo zo}. {zo nai} quotes the word {nai} instead of meaning the opposite of {zo}.

===ma===
In asking another Lojban speaker for information, a Lojban speaker might say give a bridi describing their information with a blank for the listener to insert their answer. The asker would signify that blank with {ma}. The answerer would probably not repeat the entire le bridi, but instead just the information to replace {ma} with.

In English, a person might say &quot;What&quot; or &quot;blank&quot; instead.

===la===
{la} must go before names, except names in vocatives where the speaker can replace it with a mandatory pause. English has no article for names. For non-names it has the articles &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, and &quot;the&quot;.

zo la gadri
{la} is an article.

===mi===
{mi} refers to the speaker or author. An English speaker would probably say &quot;me&quot; to mean the same. I pronounce both the same.

If I wanted to say something that didn't mean much. I would say, {mi'e mi}, pointing out the speaker as myself.

''Does {minai} mean {do}?''

''I believe that {minai} would mean anyone but yourself.''

==Intro==
When two glasses collide we hear a Sound, when we pluck guitar string we hear a Sound

Different Sound generated from different sources. Generally speaking when two objects collides will result in a Sound

Sound does not exist in Vacuum. Sound needs medium's materials to travel. it is a longitudinal wave in which the mechanical vibration constituting the wave occurs along the direction of propagation of the wave.

Velocity of Sound wave depends on Temperature and the Pressure of the Medium . Sound travels at different speed in air, through water
We can therefore define sound as a mechanical disturbance produced by the collision of two or more physical quantities from a state of equilibrium that propagates through an elastic material medium.

=Sound=

&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: white; border:1px solid #D6D6FF; padding:1em;&quot; valign=top &gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;''' &lt;math&gt;decibel(\mathrm{dB}) = 10\cdot \log\left(\frac{I_1}{I_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt; '''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
[[image:FletcherMunson_ELC.svg|thumb|400px|right|Fig. 1: The Fletcher-Munson equal-loudness contours.  Phons are labelled in blue.]]
The amplitude is the magnitude of sound pressure change within a sound wave. [[w:Sound|Sound]] amplitude can be measured in pascals (Pa), though its more common to refer to the ''sound (pressure) level'' as [[w:Sound intensity|Sound intensity]](dB,dBSPL,dB(SPL)), and the ''percieved sound level'' as [[w:Loudness|Loudness]](dBA, dB(A)). 
'''Sound intensity''' is flow of sound energy per unit time through a fixed area. It has units of 
watts per square meter. The reference Intensity is defined as the minimum Intensity that is audible 
to the human ear, it is equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or one picowatt per square meter. When the intensity is quoted in decibels this reference value is used. '''Loudness''' is sound intensity altered according to the frequency response of the human ear and is measured in a unit called the A-weighted decibel ([[w:DB(A)|dB(A)]], also used to be called [[w:phon|phon]]).



==The Decibel==
The decibel is not, as is commonly believed, the unit of sound. 
Sound is measured in terms of pressure. However, the decibel is used to express the pressure as very 
large variations of pressure are commonly encountered. The decibel is a dimensionless quantity and 
is used to express the ratio of one power quantity to another. The definition of the decibel is 
&lt;math&gt;10\cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{x}{x_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where x is a squared quantity, ie pressure squared, volts squared etc. The decibel is useful to define relative changes. For instance, the required sound decrease for new cars might be 3 dB, this means, compared to the old car the new car must be 3 dB quieter. The absolute level of the car, in this case, does not matter.

|}
&lt;br&gt;f' is the observed frequency, f is the actual frequency, v is the speed of sound (&lt;math&gt; v=336+0.6T &lt;/math&gt;), T is temperature in degrees Celsius  &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the observer, and &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of the source. If the observer is approaching the source, use the top operator (the +) in the numerator, and if the source is approaching the observer, use the top operator (the -) in the denominator. If the observer is moving away from the source, use the bottom operator (the -) in the numerator, and if the source is moving away from the observer, use the bottom operator (the +) in the denominator.

===Example problems===
A. An ambulance, which is emitting a 400 Hz siren, is moving at a speed of 30 m/s towards a stationary observer. The speed of sound in this case is 339 m/s.

&lt;math&gt;f' = 400\,\mathrm{Hz} \left( \frac{339 + 0}{339 - 30} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

B. An M551 Sheridan, moving at 10 m/s is following a Renault FT-17 which is moving in the same direction at 5 m/s and emitting a 30 Hz tone. The speed of sound in this case is 342 m/s.


&lt;math&gt;f' = 30\,\mathrm{Hz} \left( \frac{342 + 10}{342 + 5} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Torque and Circular Motion==

Circular motion is the motion of a particle at a set distance (called radius) from a point. For circular motion, there needs to be a force that makes the particle turn. This force is called the 'centripetal force.' Please note that the centripetal force is ''not'' a new type of force-it is just a force causing rotational motion.
To make this clearer, let us study the following examples:
#If Stone ties a piece of thread to a small pebble and rotates it in a horizontal circle above his head, the circular motion of the pebble is caused by the tension force in the thread.
#In the case of the motion of the planets around the sun (which is roughly circular), the force is provided by the gravitational force exerted by the sun on the planets.
Thus, we see that the centripetal force acting on a body is always provided by some other type of force -- centripetal force, thus, is simply a name to indicate the force that provides this circular motion.
This centripetal force is ''always'' acting inward toward the center. You will know this if you swing an object in a circular motion. If you notice carefully, you will see that you have to continuously pull inward.
We know that an opposite force should exist for this centripetal force(by Newton's 3rd Law of Motion). This is the centrifugal force, which exists only if we study the body from a non-inertial frame of reference(an accelerating frame of reference, such as in circular motion). This is a so-called 'pseudo-force', which is used to make the Newton's law applicable to the person who is inside a non-inertial frame. e.g. If a driver suddenly turns the car to the left, you go towards the right side of the car because of centrifugal force. The centrifugal force is equal and opposite to the centripetal force. It is caused due to inertia of a body.

&lt;math&gt; \omega_{\mathrm{avg} }=\frac{ \omega_1 +\omega_f }{2} =\frac{\theta }{t} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Average angular velocity''' is equal to one-half of the sum of '''initial''' and '''final angular velocities''' assuming constant acceleration, and is also equal to the '''angle gone through''' divided by the '''time taken'''. 
----
&lt;math&gt; \alpha =\frac{ \Delta \omega }{t} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Angular acceleration''' is equal to''' change in angular velocity''' divided by '''time taken'''. 

===Angular momentum===

'''Angular momentum''' of an object revolving around an external axis '''O''' is equal to the cross-product of the '''position vector''' with respect to '''O''' and its '''linear momentum'''.

\mathbf{L} = I\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}

'''Angular momentum''' of a rotating object is equal to the '''moment of inertia''' times '''angular velocity'''.

&lt;math&gt; L=I\omega &lt;/math&gt;

----

&lt;math&gt; \tau =I\alpha =\frac{\Delta L}{t} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Torque''' is equal to '''moment of inertia''' times '''angular acceleration''', which is also equal to the '''change in angular momentum''' divided by '''time taken'''. 
----

&lt;math&gt; K_R =\frac{1}{2} I\omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Rotational Kinetic Energy''' is equal to one-half of the product of '''moment of inertia ''' and the '''angular velocity''' squared.

'''IT IS USEFUL TO NOTE THAT'''

The equations for rotational motion are analogous to those for linear motion-just look at those listed above.
When studying rotational dynamics, remember:

*the place of force is taken by torque

*the place of mass is taken by moment of inertia

*#the place of displacement is taken by angle

*the place of linear velocity, momentum, acceleration, etc. is taken by their angular counterparts.

== French accents on computers ==

While French keyboards are available, some French students may need to enter accented characters on an English keyboard.

If you are on the Internet, many sites have a virtual keyboard that allows you to mouse-select the characters. Google Translate, for example, has a virtual keyboard icon for entering text in the form window.

===Windows Operating System===
If you are using Microsoft Windows Operating System, then you can use the Character Map application, located under:
:Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;System Tools-&gt;Character Map (Send this application to your desktop for better ease of use)

Some word processing programs allow the user to enter accents using a key combination, while others may require an Alt code.

{| {{French/Table}}
! Accent || Key combination
|-
| '''acute accent''' {{fr/sec|(accent aigu)}}
| CTRL-'
|-
| '''grave accent''' {{fr/sec|(accent grave)}}
| CTRL-`
|-
| '''circumflex''' {{fr/sec|(accent circonflexe)}}
| CTRL-SHIFT-6
|-
| '''diaeresis''' {{fr/sec|(tréma)}}
| CTRL-;
|-
| '''cedilla''' {{fr/sec|(cédille)}}
| CTRL-,
|}

The ALT code is entered by holding down the ALT key, and enter the number (all digits given) using the keypad (only the keypad).&lt;br /&gt;
In most applications, you will need the ''numlock'' turned on to avoid undesirable effects. &lt;!-- e.g. Google Chrome detects Alt-4 as a hotkey if numlock is turned off. --&gt;

{| {{French/Table}}

|-
| â || 131 || Â || 0194

===Mac Operating System===

If you are using the Mac Operating System, there is a simple system that can be used with the Option ('''⌥''') key. Open the System Preferences application (found in your Applications folder by default and in the Apple menu in the upper-left corner) and navigate to &quot;Language and Text&quot; preferences. Under the Input Sources tab, select U. S. Extended. Now you can use the following key combinations with the Option ('''⌥''') key to form French accents.

{| {{French/Table}}
! Accent || Key combination
|-
| '''acute accent''' {{fr/sec|(accent aigu)}}
| '''⌥ - e'''
|-
| '''grave accent''' {{fr/sec|(accent grave)}}
| '''⌥ - `''' (the ~ key)
|-
| '''circumflex''' {{fr/sec|(accent circonflexe)}}
| '''⌥ - 6'''
|-
| '''diaeresis''' {{fr/sec|(tréma)}}
| '''⌥ - u'''
|-
| '''cedilla''' {{fr/sec|(cédille)}}
| '''⌥ - c'''
|}

For instance: Press and hold '''⌥''' and then press '''e'''. Now you have a floating acute accent. Press '''e''' again to put the accent over that letter and form é. In the same way '''⌥ - 6''', then '''o''' will give you ô, etc. These shortcuts work throughout the operating system and do not depend on the application in which they are used.

===Linux Operating System===

If you are using Ubuntu Linux with Gnome you select the Compose key from System: Preferences: Keyboard then Layouts: Layout Options: Compose key position. You can select one of Right Alt key, Left Win-key, Right Win-key, Menu key, Right Ctrl key or Caps Lock key (for a USA keyboard layout). The Keyboard preferences dialog has an area you can use to test the settings. See below for how to use the Compose key. Ubuntu with a different window manager, such as KDE should have a similar keyboard preferences utility.

If you are using Unix or a derivative operating system (such as Linux) with XFree86, you can define a compose key by opening a terminal window and typing:

'To use the Windows menu key (between the right Windows key and right Ctrl key:
: xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Menu = Multi_key&quot;

'To use the right Windows key:
: xmodmap -e &quot;keysym R_Meta = Multi_key&quot;

'To use the right Alt key:'
: xmodmap -e &quot;keysym Alt_Gr = Multi_key&quot;

To use the Compose key, press and release the Compose key, then type two characters. Combinations useful for typing in French follow:

: à Compose + a + `
: â Compose + a + ^
: ä Compose + a + &quot;

: ç Compose + c + ,

: è Compose + e + `
: é Compose + e + '
: ê Compose + e + ^
: ë Compose + e + &quot;
: É Compose + E + '

: î Compose + i + ^
: ï Compose + i + &quot;

: ô Compose + o + ^
: ö Compose + o + &quot;

: ù Compose + u + `
: û Compose + u + ^
: ü Compose + u + &quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Waves= 
Wave is defined as the movement of any periodic motion like a spring, a pendulum, a water wave, an electric wave, a sound wave, a light wave, etc.

[[Image:wave characteristics.svg|right|frame|400px|A wave with constant amplitude.]]
Any periodic wave that has amplitude varied with time, phase sinusoidally can be expressed mathematically as 
:; R(t , θ) = R Sin (ωt + θ) 

* Minimum wave height (trough) at angle 0, π, 2π, ... 
:; F(R,t,θ) = 0 at θ = nπ 

* Maximum wave height (peak or crest) at π/2, 3π/2, ... 
:; F(R,t,θ) = R at θ = (2n+1)π/2

* Wavelength (distance between two crests) λ = 2π. 
:λ = 2π - A circle or a wave
:2λ = 2(2π) - Two circles or two waves
:kλ = k2π - Circle k or k amount of waves

* Wave Number, 
:; k

* Velocity (or Angular Velocity), 
:; ω = 2πf

* Time Frequency, 
:; f = 1 / t

* Time
:; t = 1 / f



'''Wave speed''' is equal to the '''frequency''' times the '''wavelength'''.  It can be understood as how frequently a certain distance (the wavelength in this case) is traversed.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{v}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Frequency''' is equal to '''speed''' divided by '''wavelength'''.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; T = \frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Period''' is equal to the inverse of '''frequency'''.

&lt;H2&gt;Variables&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;br&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
'''&amp;lambda;:''' wavelength (m)&lt;br&gt;
'''v:''' wave speed (m/s)&lt;br&gt;
'''f:''' frequency (1/s), (Hz)&lt;br&gt;
'''T:''' period (s)
|}

&lt;H2&gt;Definition of terms&lt;/H2&gt;

|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
'''Wavelength (''&amp;lambda;'')''': The length of one wave, or the distance from a point on one wave to the same point on the next wave. Units: meters (m). In light, ''&amp;lambda;'' tells us the color.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Wave speed (v)''': the speed at which the wave pattern moves. Units: meters per second, (m/s)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Frequency of oscillation (''f'')''' (or just '''frequency'''): the number of times the wave pattern repeats itself in one second. Units: seconds&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = (1/s) = hertz (Hz) In sound, ''f'' tells us the pitch. The inverse of frequecy is the period of oscillation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Period of oscillation (''T'')''' (or just '''period'''): duration of time between one wave and the next one passing the same spot.  Units: seconds (s). The inverse of the period is frequency. Use a capital, italic ''T'' and not a lowercase one, which is used for time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Amplitude (''A'')''': the maximum height of the wave measured from the average height of the wave (the wave’s center). Unit: meters (m)

The wave’s extremes, its peaks and valleys, are called '''antinodes'''. At the middle of the wave are points that do not move, called '''nodes'''. 

''Examples of waves:'' Water waves, sound waves, light waves, seismic waves, shock waves, electromagnetic waves …

==Oscillation==
A wave is said to oscillate, which means to move back and forth in a regular, repeating way. This fluctuation can be between extremes of position, force, or quantity. 

Different types of waves have different types of oscillations.

'''Longitudinal waves:''' Oscillation is parallel to the direction of the wave. Examples: sound waves, waves in a spring.

'''Transverse waves:''' Oscillation is perpendicular to direction of the wave. Example: light

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:tranlong.png|tranlong.png]] --&gt;

==Interference==
When waves overlap each other it is called '''interference'''. This is divided into '''constructive''' and '''destructive''' interference. 

'''Constructive interference:''' the waves line up perfectly and add to each others’ strength.


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Constructive-interference.png]] --&gt;


'''Destructive interference:''' the two waves cancel each other out, resulting in no wave.


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Destructive-interference.png]] --&gt;

==Resonance==
In real life, waves usually give a mishmash of constructive and destructive interference and quickly die out. However, at certain wavelengths standing waves form, resulting in '''resonance'''. These are waves that bounce back into themselves in a strengthening way, reaching maximum amplitude.

''Resonance is a special case of forced vibration when the frequency of the impressed periodic force is equal to the natural frequency of the body so that it vibrates with increased amplitude, spontaneously.''

==How to Play Audios ==
The Sample audio, what program to i need to listin to it?
Andrewcool
:Good question.  I'll need to research that.  It just plays &quot;automatically&quot; when I click on it, so I think any PC media player ? - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
When i open it, it doesn't open automatic. It wants me to choose the program to open it but so far i have not found one that works.
:Yes, Windows does give me that &quot;choice&quot; too. My computer has AudioCentral by Roxio and that plays the file just fine, but I seem to recall that the default Windows media player also worked ok. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:47, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC) 

Well we can covert the .ogg and make them into .wav for people who are having problems with this. -Andrewcool
:Sounds good to me. I've got to admit, I know nothing about sound files - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 03:53, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)
 Well wiki only wants .ogg so that means we will need somebody else to host it.--[[User:Andrewcool|Andrewcool]] 23:54, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Foobar works well. google it. -thisdude415

:Get the OGG codec.  Google that.

==The Description Of Sounds==
The long and short 'a' sounds are not very different.  For example, I would say the 'a' in father and the 'o' in pot are about the same, only the first (father) is strung out a bit more (ahhhh vs ah).  When I try this in German I see about the same difference: ''haben'' = ahhhh, ''acht'' = ah.  In English, these would both be short vowel sounds. Am I missing something, or is that all there is to it? Is there a better way to differentiate the long and short 'a' in German? Is it really correct to call these long and short vowel sounds? -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:30, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Hey Marsh! I'd say, you got it completely right. But there is a third sound in German sometimes discriped as an &quot;a&quot;-sound. It's the sound of &quot;-er&quot; at the ending of a word (e.g. Keller = Basement). This sound is somewhere between kell-ea and Kell-a. Think of how it's pronounced in rap slang (kill-a) or of the way Bob Marley pronounced Rast-a. -- [[User:Guido|Guido]]

::Hi, I've to say, taht is not right. It's maybe a bit slang, but someone speaking real good german would say kell-er and not kella. I do it myself, but I know that's because of my accent. -louisana 

===The Ö-Laut===
Hey to all out there. What do you think: does the '''short''' Ö (as in 'Köln') sound like the 'ear' in a (British pronounced) &quot;heard&quot;. To me it does.

: British &quot;ear&quot; in &quot;heard&quot; is IMHO more similar to a '''long''' Ö (as in 'hören'); but in general, &quot;heard&quot; should be mentioned as a guideline for pronouncing 'ö'. The existing explanation is good however (I was not aware that the 'Ö' from my native country's name had anything to do with whistling or the sound in 'late', but following those instructions works!).

===Examples not useful===
is to my mind a bit poor.
I know,  English textbooks for German explain sounds that way. And they will not break a habit.
Result: an unacceptable pronunciation.
Let us see how the German &quot;e&quot; is explained: as in lay with no movement.
What movement? Movement of the tongue. Okay. But is there any English speaking person aware of that movement?
The result would be better if a sound like in &quot;get&quot; is made long. And that would exactly be what it is: a German e.

: I think that means no movement in the sound (not physical movement), although obviously to move or alter a sound there must be some subtle movement of the speech apparatus. Making the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;get&quot; long would sound like &quot;e&quot; in &quot;week&quot;.  A &quot;long&quot; e in English is not a long &quot;e&quot; in German or even close. Coming from the English speaking perspective, the explanations are pefectly sensible. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]

I fully agree that the German e is, in fact, the same sound as the e in &quot;get&quot; made long; just keep your mouth and tongue in the same position and keep the air going. The &quot;e&quot; in &quot;week&quot; has nothing to do with the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;get&quot;, that's just an artifact of English orthography. The description based on &quot;lay&quot; might be good because it explicitly warns about the most common pronounciation mistake that English speaking people make; on the other hand, it is far less useful to people who already speak other languages besides English.

:I disagree, that the German long &quot;e&quot; is the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;get&quot; made long, and I am myself a German native speaker. Actually, the &quot;e&quot; sound in &quot;get&quot; ([ɛ] in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet IPA]) pronounced as long vowel [ɛː] is closer to the German long &quot;ä&quot; than to the long &quot;e&quot; ([eː]). Unfortunately, also many German native speakers don't use or know the [ɛː] sound and pronounce the long &quot;ä&quot; just like the long German &quot;e&quot;, especially in the north of Germany. --[[User:Tobulax|Tobulax]] 07:51, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

=== Austrian Pronunciation ===

There are two important differences in how German is pronounced in Austria from what is described here. I'm not talking about dialects, just the most important basic differences, analogous to the differences in British and American English. For one, the &quot;s&quot; in Austrian is not pronounced as a 'z' at the start of a word, e.g. in &quot;Sonne&quot;. AFAICT, it may only be pronounced 'z' when it is between two vowels, e.g. &quot;Rose&quot;. Also, &quot;ig&quot; as in richtig is NOT pronounced as an ich-sound, but rather as &quot;i&quot;+&quot;g&quot;.
Would it be more appropriate to mention these differences in the text where the letters are described (as is already done to describe the absence of &quot;ß&quot; in Switzerland), or should a separate short section outlining the differences be added at the end, in order to keep things simpler for people who just want to learn the &quot;dominant&quot; form of German?
:I agree it is a good idea to bring up these differences and I would think that mentioning it where specifically appropriate (as with the Swiss example) would be best - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:37, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

=== Pronunciation of German alphabet ===

The one thing that is always ailing me is that almost all german textbooks present the sound of german alphabets by means of using similiar english words, like &quot;bay&quot;, &quot;ah&quot;. Many of those descriptions are pretty vague actually like &quot;Slightly more dental&quot; for L and some are absent like Ü. I suggest presenting those alphabets with IPA which is more convenient for linguistically more advanced users.

: Not to mention that this pronunciation system is just plain wrong in many cases.  I'd be willing to help IPA it. - [[User:71.136.181.45|71.136.181.45]] 08:59, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== The German Alphabet - oggfile ==

I think the ogg-file is not that good. I would speak it again, if you need it. Just contact me on meta. I also could speak more, if you want to. [[m:User:Louisana]]
:If you can create a better one, by all means please do. I have not the technical skills to create sound files  - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 05:05, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
Done. For further request please use my meta talk page! Also spoke something [[German:_Introduction#German_and_English|here]] [[m:User:Louisana]]

== Syllable stress: It's not that easy! ==

It's not generally correct that always the first syllable is stressed. For words with prefix or suffix syllables, it becomes more complex. A a native German, I never learnt formal rules for that, but in most cases the first syllable of the ''stem'' of the word (without pre- and suffixes) is stressed, but there are lots of exceptions. Those who know German, confer [[:w:de:Wortakzent#Wortakzent im Deutschen]], with the example of '''um'''fahren (to knock '''over''') vs. um'''fah'''ren (to '''drive''' round). --[[User:Langec|Langec]] 20:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== First alphabet audio file appears to be bogus ==

After the table showing the alphabet there are two audio files which are fine.

But in the title for the table, where you see &quot;German Dialogue • Alphabet • audio&quot;, the audio link is to a file &quot;German Dialogue - The alphabet.ogg&quot;.

This file was uploaded in November 2006 by Paulaburesh who is no longer a registered user.

The history page for this file is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Image:German_Dialogue_-_The_alphabet.ogg&amp;action=history here].

This file is not an OGG file (I've looked at the binary data and it does not start with the sequence &quot;OggS&quot; as it should).

I suggest it be deleted.

== Pronunciation of the alphabet in the German language ==

I have noticed some weird ideas on the pronunciation of the alphabet in the German language.
The letter b is never pronounced as a 'p' unless one hails from &quot;Payern&quot; (= Bayern/Bavaria).
The letter g is not really pronounced as a 'k' at the end of a word, but like in English as a hard 'g', 
or softened to a German 'ch' like in Bach or ich.
One should always be aware -especially as a non-German- that the German pronunciation has a 
tremendous variation dependent on the region; Austrian or Swiss German is certainly not the standard.
PS I myself am a 'Grenzer' from the Netherlands with a severe German accent, which I was born with.

== More sound examples please ==

A lot of discussion could be made moot if the page would include sound examples of individual words to illustrate how it is really pronounced. This prevent a lot of confusion. E.g. the page says that short i is pronounced as the i in English pit. To my ears -Dutch ones- that is not really true. German mit and English Mitt are not the same. Sound files please.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why is &quot;polynomials and number theory&quot; presented before &quot;rings, fields and modules&quot;, which is in turn presented before &quot;group theory&quot;?

: Rings and fields will be touched upon briefly in polys and number theory, while a more indepth discussion will be in the rings, fields and modules section. Groups are a little more distanced from these, but I think I'll take your suggestion and move that section down :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:14, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I am curious as to the inclusion of Set Theory in Discrete mathematics - especially since there is already a distinct [[Set Theory]] book (although there is almost nothing in it).  Surely discrete mathematics is concerned almost exclusively with finite or possible countable sets, and a full treatment of set theory is not appropriate here.  Would it not be more sensible to merge these, and have one book on set theory, covering both naive and axiomatic set theory? [[User:J Bytheway|J Bytheway]] 23:08, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: If there is nothing in [[Set Theory]], it should be redirected to the book here. Our efforts should be unified. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:56, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Split ==
Why split the book up? How is one to find general topics on discrete math?

Oh my gosh! I saw the word &quot;split&quot; and thought of a made up step in induction called &quot;split&quot; when I was first taught it!
Speaking of which, should I add recursion and induction as sections too?

BTW, to kinda answer your question, this is wikibooks, an in-depth look at discrete etc. If you want a general overview look at the main wikipedia page.

=== Genitive case personal pronouns ===

The '''genitive''' case corresponds to the '''possessive''' case in English or to the English objective case preceded by 'of' and denoting possession. The use of genitive personal pronouns is very rare in German and many Germans are unable to use them correctly.

=== Dative case personal pronouns ===
The personal pronouns in the '''dative''' case are used as indirect objects of verbs and after the prepositions '''''aus, außer, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu'''''.

Fundamental frequency: the frequency when the wavelength is the longest allowed, this gives us the lowest sound that we can get from the system.

In a string, the length of the string is half of the largest wavelength that can create a standing wave, called its fundamental wavelength.

=Wave overtones=

For resonance in a taut string, the '''first harmonic''' is determined for a wave form with one '''antinode''' and two '''nodes'''.  That is, the two ends of the string are nodes because they do not vibrate while the middle of the string is an antinode because it experiences the greatest change in amplitude.  This means that one half of a full wavelength is represented by the length of the resonating structure.

The frequency of the '''first harmonic''' is equal to '''wave speed''' divided by twice the '''length''' of the string.  (Recall that wave speed is equal to wavelength times frequency.)

The first overtone is the first ''allowed'' harmonic above the fundamental frequency (''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

In the case of a system with two different ends (as in the case of a tube open at one end), the closed end is a node and the open end is an antinode.  The first resonant frequency has only a quarter of a wave in the tube.  This means that the '''first harmonic''' is characterized by a wavelength four times the length of the tube.

Astronomy is the scientific study of the universe as a whole, and of celestial bodies and the underlying physics governing those bodies. It is one of the oldest of the natural sciences having been practiced by even very ancient civilizations, but it is also among the most modernized of the sciences, having extensively exploited advances in technology. The progress of technology has dramatically improved our understanding of the universe, and revealed a richer tapestry than had ever been imagined. This Wikibook introduces the reader to that tapestry and the process that revealed it to humanity. It presents astronomy not only as a field of knowledge, but also as a human endeavor in science.

[[General Astronomy|&lt;&lt; Astronomy]] | [[../The Sun|The Sun &gt;&gt;]]

'''The Solar System''' may be broadly defined as that portion of the universe under the gravitational influence of the Sun. This includes the Sun itself as well as all planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust, and ice orbiting the Sun.

The Solar System is an example of a [[../Star System|star system]], which is similarly defined as that portion of the universe under the gravitational influence of one or more co-orbiting stars. The Solar System is a unitary star system, as it has only one star (Sol, our Sun).

== Components of the Solar System ==
[[Image:Solar_planets.jpg|thumb|right|The Solar System]]
The largest, most massive, and most prominent element of the Solar System is, of course, the Sun. The Sun makes up 99.8% of the mass of the Solar System. It is literally the point around which the entire Solar System turns. The Sun is virtually at the center of the Solar System; although gravity tugs by the planets may move the center of the System slightly away from the center of the Sun, it always resides deep within the Sun's core.

The next largest objects in the Solar System are the planets. There are generally considered to be eight planets in the Solar System. They can be divided into two types: (1) the gas giant planets,which include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune and (2) the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. All eight planets orbit the Sun in elliptical, roughly circular orbits, in approximately the same plane. However, no planet orbits in exactly a circular orbit or exactly in the plane of the Sun's rotation. The orbit of Jupiter is the closest to the plane and circularity; the orbit of Pluto (a dwarf planet) deviates the most from both the plane and from circularity.

After the eight major planets are the minor planets, asteroids and comets. Asteroids and comets are smaller objects than planets, but also orbit the Sun. Asteroids and comets are distinguished by their content: asteroids are primarily made up of rock, while comets are primarily made of ices and volatile compounds. 

Minor planets may be found anywhere in the Solar System, in orbits varying from circular to highly elliptical. Most, however, are found in three belts. The [[../Main Asteroid Belt|main asteroid belt]] is found between the planets Mars and Jupiter. As the name implies, it is made almost entirely of asteroids. The [[../Kuiper Belt/]] is found outside the orbit of Neptune, and encompasses the area from 30 to 100 astronomical units from the Sun. The Kuiper belt contains mainly comets, including very large comet-like objects called cubewanos or plutinos. Some astronomers also consider Pluto to be part of the Kuiper belt. The [[../Oort Cloud/]] is another belt of comets, and is believed to extend out to approximately one light-year from the Sun. Its existence is deduced from the frequent visitation of long-period comets, comets with extremely elliptical or even hyperbolic orbits.

==Arrangement of the Solar System==

The Solar System may be divided by its components into three major regions: the inner system, the near outer system, and the far outer system. The near outer system might also be referred to as the middle system. The general term outer system refers to both the near and far outer systems.

The inner system is composed of the Sun, the terrestrial planets and their moons, close-orbiting asteroids and comets, and the main asteroid belt. Objects in the inner system are almost exclusively composed of rock, with either no atmosphere or an atmosphere that composes little of the object's mass. The inner system's boundary is defined by the main asteroid belt, which separates it from the near outer system.

The near outer system is composed of the gas giant planets and their moons, and asteroids and comets that orbit between the main asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt. Objects in the near outer system may have rock, liquid, gas, and ice as significant components. The near outer system's boundary is defined by the orbit of Neptune.

The far outer system is composed of the ice planet Pluto, the Kuiper belt, the Oort Cloud, and comets that orbit between the belt and the cloud. Objects in the far outer system may have some rock components, but are mainly composed of ices.

==Boundary of the Solar System==

The boundary of the Solar System is defined in two ways. The gravitational boundary may be described as the point at which objects no longer orbit the Sun. This boundary includes the Oort Cloud, but is poorly defined, as an object is not compelled to orbit the Sun at any point. Another definition is to declare the heliopause as the boundary of the Solar System. This boundary is more easily detectable and definable, but resides well within the Oort Cloud.

This book aims to be a comprehensive source for any developer who is interested in programming for the Windows platform. It starts at the lowest level, with the Win32 API (C and VB Classic) and then goes over to [[/Microsoft Foundation Classes/|MFC]] (C++). Beyond these basic sections, it will cover COM, and the creation of ActiveX modules from a variety of languages. Next, it delves into the Windows DDK, and talk about programming device drivers for Windows platform. Finally, it moves on to the highest-level programming tasks, including shell extensions, shell scripting, and finally ASP and WSH.

Other topics that will be discussed here are: Writing screen-savers, creating HTML help modules, and compiling DLL files. 

This book will focus on topics that are specific to Windows, and avoids general programming topics. For related material the reader is encouraged to look into Wikibooks other works, they will cover general programming, ASM, C, C++, Visual Basic and Visual Basic.NET and other languages and concepts in greater detail. Appropriate links to these books are provided.

The reader is assumed to have a previous knowledge of the programming languages involved. Specifically, prior knowledge in C, C++, and Visual Basic is required for certain sections of this book.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vectors''' are quantities that are characterized by having both a numerical '''quantity''' (called the &quot;magnitude&quot; and denoted as |''v''|) and a '''direction'''. Velocity is an example of a vector; it describes the time rated change in position with a numerical quantity (meters per second) as well as indicating the direction of movement.

The definition of a vector is any quantity that adds according to the parallelogram law (there are some physical quantities that have magnitude and direction that are not vectors).

'''Scalars''' are quantities in physics that have '''no direction'''. Mass is a scalar; it can describe the quantity of matter with units (kilograms) but does not describe any direction.

==Multiplying vectors and scalars==
*A '''scalar''' times a '''scalar''' gives a '''scalar''' result. 
*A '''vector''' scalar-multiplied by a '''vector''' gives a '''scalar''' result (called the dot-product).
*A '''vector''' cross-multiplied by a '''vector''' gives a '''vector''' result (called the cross-product).
*A '''vector''' times a '''scalar''' gives a '''vector''' result.

==Frequently Asked Questions about Vectors==
=====When are scalar and vector compositions essentially the same?=====
'''Answer:''' when multiple vectors are in same direction then we can just add the magnitudes.so, the scalar and vector composition will be same as we do not add the directions. 
=====What is a &quot;dot-product&quot;? (work when force not parallel to displacement)=====
[[Image:Man_walking_up_a_hill.png|thumb|A Man walking up a hill]] 
'''Answer:''' Let's take gravity as our force.  If you jump out of an airplane and fall you will pick up speed. (for simplicity's sake, let's ignore air drag). To work out the kinetic energy at any point you simply multiply the ''value'' of the force caused by gravity by the ''distance'' moved in the direction of the force. For example, a 180 N boy falling a distance of 10 m will have 1800 J of extra kinetic energy. We say that the man has had 1800 J of work done on him by the force of gravity. 


Notice that energy is ''not'' a vector. It has a value but no direction. Gravity and displacement are vectors. They have a value plus a direction. (In this case, their directions are down and down respectively) The reason we can get a scalar energy from vectors gravity and displacement is because, in this case, they happen to point in the same direction. Gravity acts downwards and displacement is also downwards.

When two vectors point in the same direction, you can get the scalar product by just multiplying the ''value'' of the two vectors together and ignoring the direction.

But what happens if they don't point in the same direction?


Consider a man walking up a hill. Obviously it takes energy to do this because you are going against the force of gravity. The steeper the hill, the more energy it takes every step to climb it. This is something we all know unless we live on a salt lake.

In a situation like this we can still work out the work done. In the diagram, the green lines represent the displacement. To find out how much work ''against'' gravity the man does, we work out the ''projection'' of the displacement along the line of action of the force of gravity. In this case it's just the y component of the man's displacement. This is where the cos &amp;theta; comes in. &amp;theta; is merely the angle between the velocity vector and the force vector.

If the two forces do not point in the same direction, you can still get the scalar product by multiplying the projection of one force in the direction of the other force.  Thus:
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\equiv \|\vec{a}\|\ \|\vec{b}\|\ \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;}}
There is another method of defining the dot product which relies on components.
{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border: solid 3px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\equiv a_xb_x+a_yb_y+a_zb_z&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====What is a &quot;cross-product&quot;? (Force on a charged particle in a magnetic field)=====

'''Answer:''' Suppose there is a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field. According to the laws of electromagnetism, the particle is acted upon by a force called the Lorentz force.  If this particle is moving from left to right at 30 m/s and the field is 30 Tesla pointing straight down perpendicular to the particle, the particle will actually curve in a circle spiraling out of the plane of the two with an acceleration of its charge in coulombs times 900 newtons per coulomb!  This is because the calculation of the Lorentz force involves a cross-product.when cross product can replace the sin0 can take place during multiplication.
A cross product can be calculated simply using the angle between the two vectors and your right hand.  If the forces point parallel or 180&amp;deg; from each other, it's simple: the cross-product does not exist.  If they are exactly perpendicular, the cross-product has a magnitude of the product of the two magnitudes.  For all others in between however, the following formula is used:

{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border: solid 3px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\left\|\vec{a}\times\vec{b}\right\| = \left\|\vec{a}\right\|\ \left\|\vec{b}\right\|\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;
|}


[[File:Right_hand_rule_cross_product.svg|thumb|The right-hand rule: point your index finger along the first vector and your middle finger across the second; your thumb will point in the direction of the resulting vector]]
But if the result is a vector, then what is the direction? That too is fairly simple, utilizing a method called the &quot;right-hand rule&quot;.

The right-hand rule works as follows:  Place your right-hand flat along the first of the two vectors with the palm facing the second vector and your thumb sticking out perpendicular to your hand.  Then proceed to curl your hand towards the second vector.  The direction that your thumb points is the direction that cross-product vector points!  Though this definition is easy to explain visually it is slightly more complicated to calculate than the dot product.
{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border: solid 3px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;math&gt;(a_x,\ a_y,\ a_z)\times(b_x,\ b_y,\ b_z) =(a_yb_z-a_zb_y\ ,a_xb_z-a_zb_x\ ,a_xb_y-a_yb_x)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====How to draw vectors that are in or out of the plane of the page (or board)=====
[[Image:Vector addition subtraction.svg|thumb|How to draw vectors in the plane of the paper]]
[[Image:Notation for vectors in or out of a plane.svg|thumb|Standard symbols of a vector going into or out of a page]]
'''Answer:''' Vectors in the plane of the page are drawn as arrows on the page.  A vector that goes into the plane of the screen is typically drawn as circles with an inscribed X.  A vector that comes out of the plane of the screen is typically drawn as circles with dots at their centers. The X is meant to represent the fletching on the back of an arrow or dart while the dot is meant to represent the tip of the arrow.

==Indonesian and Malay==
Maybe this book should be presented as Indonesian and Malay?  If you don't have time to add notes for where Malay is different, somebody else might do it.

:Sure thing. --[[User:Robbyjo|Roby Joehanes]] 21:55, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I disagree.  For one, I don't know where they differ, but also, they are different languages.  Sure, there's a high degree of mutual understanding between speakers of the language, but they should be different books.

If the people writing the Malay one want to copy and paste this one with minor alterations then they can feel free, but they shouldn't be merged. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 14:21, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

:I also disagree - they are significantly different. I think of it as being like someone from London and someone from Scotland speaking in a Scots-influenced English. (I'm not trying to say which is which - just that there's differences in accent and vocab). Note that Indonesian has a lot of Dutch words that don't occur in Malay, and Malay has more English influence. See the Wikipedia article [[w:Differences between Malay and Indonesian|Differences between Malay and Indonesian]] (and that could be linked from this Wikibook, rather than duplicating the work). 

:I like the idea, though, of having notes on where [[Malay]] differs, in the text or in a section at the end of the page; also of this book copying and modifying pages to and from Malay, where appropriate. Perhaps there could be a template used temporarily at the top of a Malay page, saying something like &quot;This page has been copied from the Indonesian Wikibook, and may need further changes to reflect Malay usage.&quot; Or the reverse if copied from the Malay to the Indonesian Wikibook. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 01:30, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

== How can I say it in Indonesian language? ==

How can I say &quot; How was the school? &quot; in Indonesian language?

thank you,

jameelhy@yahoo.com

It's probably too late and I can't tell when you made the edit because you didn't sign your post, but it's ''bagaimana sekolahnya?'' although, due to Indonesian's lack of tenses this could mean &quot;how is the school?&quot; as well. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 14:21, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

==This is a good book==
Thank you for this nice project. -- 22:40, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

Thank you

== Just a thought ==
I feel that the &quot;ahli&quot; section of this page concentrate too much on &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; instead of the formal and more advanced &quot;Bahasa Indonesia.&quot; It should include a more complex vocabulary than those in the &quot;beginner section&quot;
Thanks

I agree, but I would like to think that my particular area of expertise is &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; so that's what I wrote lessons on.  It's not concentrated on &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; for any reason other than no one else has written any lessons for it yet.  It's a work in progress.  If you have specific requests for lessons then post them here and I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, 
[[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 08:48, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

== Advanced vocab ==

I've been doing a web search for an advanced vocabulary list with no luck. Does anyone know a good link? Such a link would also be useful as an &quot;external link&quot; or &quot;additional resource&quot; for an &quot;advanced&quot; page in this Wikibook.

Memorising lists of words suits my style of learning (I use mnemonics - but of course I also need to back it up with practice). 

I'm at the stage where I can read a newspaper or book without too much difficulty, but there's still a few words per article or page that I don't understand. Making my own lists as I go works okay, but a ready made vocab list would be more efficient. Memorising words from a dictionary is probably going to give me a lot of rarely used words (and all of them starting with &quot;A&quot;...!)

For the moment though, I do appreciate the pages on informal use from Mr John. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 01:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

:I found a site with some tips on mnemonics - but only two, and at a very basic level. [http://wwwfp.education.tas.gov.au/indonesianonline/TR/TRs_Penyelematan_binatang/Making%20connections.html Teacher Resource - Penyelamatan binatang]
The tips, on one of the linked PDFs, are:
:* &lt;tt&gt;Many students mix up the numbers 4 and 6 (empat and enam) - but maybe remembering that you 'pat' a dog which has four legs will help. &lt;/tt&gt;
:* &lt;tt&gt;How can you remember the meanings of kanan and kiri (right and left)? Perhaps simply that kanan and right both have five letters; and kiri and left both have four.&lt;/tt&gt;
:These could be rewritten and included in a mnemonics page, e.g. [[Indonesian/Mnemonics]] - I don't know a good translation for mnemonics, unless we use ''cara penghafalan'' or ''cara menghafalkan kata''. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

::I'm starting a page here: [[Indonesian/Adding vocabulary with word association]] - it probably needs a better name, and it's very basic, but it's a start.  --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 05:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the compliments, I'm glad the articles are of interest.  If you have any other areas of slang you'd like articles on, let me know. On the subject of vocab lists, I'm not sure how useful they are without the context of an article...  If you find an online article that you think is a good example (that we're allowed to use) I'd be happy to list the difficult and interesting words, provide some commentary on the article and maybe have some comprehension questions at the end...  Would that be more useful than just having parallel translations?[[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 08:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Can we use other free (as in beer) sites as part of a curriculum? ==
A page on the above Tasmanian Department of Education site, [http://wwwfp.education.tas.gov.au/indonesianonline/learningobjects.htm Learning Objects], has some free, useful resources for beginners &amp; high school students. (Graphics based, with very slow, clear pronunciation... rather formal (''Kalau bepergian''?? I never heard the word ''bepergian'' in 2 years in Indo - only ''pergi''), but that's standard for Indonesian lessons in Australia, I find.) 

Resources like these which are free (as in beer) but not open-source are good for giving inspiration - no controversy, I think. I think they are also good for linking from the modules, and even using as part of the curriculum - at least until we have developed better resources here. This would consist of linking from a Wikibooks page, not replicating or infringeing copyright in any way.

Would this conflict with Wikibooks policies? --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

:I asked this at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Can we use other free (as in beer) sites as part of a curriculum?|the Staff lounge]] and it seems that Wikiversity encourages this practice, and there doesn't seem to be a policy against it in Wikibooks (perhaps making it clear that that we're not endorsing the external link). --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 05:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Audiobook (Pimsleur?) ==

This wikibook is a great effort to provide instructional tools in learning Bahasa Indonesia. It would be great if there is an accompanying audio instruction.

Recently I've been using Pimsleur methods to learn spanish, and I find it very good. If anyone is an expert in liguistic and language instructional methods, and is interested in doing Pimsleur audio on Indonesian language, I'd be delighted to help to read out the phrases, since I'm an indonesian native speaker. However, I can't be the one who organize and edit the audio because I don't have experience in language teaching methods. Besides, I think &quot;pimsleur method&quot; itself is not copyrighted (am I correct) although there are pimsleur branded instructional recordings released by Simon and Schuster. Hence I'd think it's possible to replicate the method and record our own instructional recordings in order to make language instruction more accessible (currently the Simon and Schuster Pimsleur is really expensive!).

[[User:Chaerani|Chaerani]] 01:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

== Childrens' songs == 

I like this section.  I'm glad to see the wikibook has progressed since I last looked at it.  I'll add a few songs soon.  As far as I know most childrens' songs are open source.  It could be interesting to add some popular songs and comment on the lyrics there, but I'm not sure if we'd be violating copyright...  Does anyone want to weigh in on this?

Incidentally, I have no idea how to add audio to these pages...  If someone does work out how to do it I could record some of the childrens' songs on guitar and post them...  I'd rather not sing them though if someone wants to go a wikollaboration. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 08:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:There are some good [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/Recording_guidelines recording guidelines] for the Spoken Wikipedia that you can look at. Then just upload to [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]] or Wikibooks using the &quot;Upload file&quot; link in the Toolbox on the sidebar (must be logged in). Have a look at [[Chinese/Lesson_1]] to see how I linked to audio from within the lessons. I wouldn't worry of you can only provide the guitar. Using Audacity it's easy to splice audio together, so someone could add their singing voice later on. -&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 10:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

Work is equal to the integral of '''force''' times '''velocity''' times '''displacement''' times '''time.'''

An integral, if the force isn't constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''When work is applied to an object or a system it adds or removes kinetic energy to or from that object or system. More precisely, a net force in one direction, when applied to an object moving opposite or in the same direction as the force, kinetic energy will be added or removed to or from that object. (Someone please explain this to me though because energy is not a vector.) Note that work and energy are measured in the same unit, the Joule (J).''
:That's why you have to use a scaler product! Work is the scaler product of force and displacement. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:37, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Please, what is a scalar product ? If I dont know this, many other people wont know this, and we could use a good, concise definition here on the site. Thanks, --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

OK I'll have a go. Let's take gravity as our force.  If you jump out of an aeroplane and fall you will pick up speed. (for simplicity sake let's ignore air drag). To work out the kinetic energy at any point you just multiply the  ''value'' of the force of gravity, by the ''distance'' moved. So for example a 100kg man falling a distance of 10m will have 1000kJ extra kinetic energy. We say that the man has had 1000kJ of work done on him by the force of gravity. 

Notice that energy is ''not'' a vector, it has a value but no direction. Gravity and dispacement are vectors. They have a value plus a direction.(In this case their directions are down and down respectively) The reason we can get a scalar energy from vectors gravity and dispacement is because in this case they happen to point in the same direction. Gravity acts downwards and displacement is also downwards. 

When two vectors point in the same direction, you can get the scalar product by just multiplying the ''value'' of the two vectors together and ignoring the direction.


What happens if they don't point in the same direction?
[[Image:Man_walking_up_a_hill.png]] 


Consider a man walking up a hill. Obvoiusly it takes energy to do this because you are going against the force of gravity. The steeper the hill the more energy it takes every step, this is something we all know unless we live on a salt lake.

In a situation like this we can still work out the work done. In the diagram the green lines represents the displacement. To fond out how much work ''against'' gravity the man does we work out the ''projection'' of the displacement along the line of action of the force of gravity. In this case it's just the y component of the man's displacement. This is where the cos&amp;theta; comes in. 

If the two forces do not point in the same direction, you can still get the scaler product by multiplying the projection of one force in the direction of the other force. '''A'''('''B'''cos&amp;theta;)

I hopes this makes sense. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:16, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

But don't these situations only apply in the specific instances that you have described? Surely, the relationship might not always be cos theta, rather sin theta. Sorry if I'm mistaken. Also, the formula describing work done = deltaKE + deltaPE is also a specific instance, where there are no losses, for example air resisitance or friction. Shouldn't this be mentioned? If you're going into the preciseness of vectors and scalars or whatever, shouldn't this be mentioned? Finally, I'd just like to say it's a great job you're doing here!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''linear transformation''' is an important concept in mathematics because many real world phenomena can be approximated by linear models. 

Unlike a linear function, a linear transformation works on vectors as well as numbers.

== Motivations and definitions ==
Say we have the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, and we rotate it through 90 degrees, to obtain the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Another example instead of rotating a vector, we stretch it, so a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;2\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, for example. &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, if we look at the ''projection'' of one vector onto the ''x'' axis - extracting its ''x'' component - , e.g. from
&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These examples are all an example of a ''mapping'' between two vectors, and are all linear transformations. If the rule transforming the matrix is called &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, we often write &lt;math&gt;T\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; for the mapping of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; by the rule &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is often called the transformation.

Note we do not always write brackets like when we write functions. However we ''should'' write brackets, especially when we want to express the mapping of the sum or the product or the combination of many vectors.

== Definitions ==
===Linear Operators===

Suppose one has a field K, and let x be an element of that field. Let O be a function taking values from K where O(x) is an element of a field J. Define O to be a linear form if and only if:
# O(x+y)=O(x)+O(y)
# O(&amp;lambda;x)=&amp;lambda;O(x)

===Linear Forms===
Suppose one has a vector space V, and let x be an element of that vector space. Let F be a function taking values from V where F(x) is an element of a field K. Define F to be a linear form if and only if:
# F(x+y)=F(x)+F(y)
# F(&amp;lambda;x)=&amp;lambda;F(x)

===Linear Transformation===
This time, instead of a field, let us consider functions from one vector space into another vector space. Let T be a function taking values from one vector space V where L(V) are elements of another vector space. Define L to be a linear transformation when it:
# ''preserves scalar multiplication'': T(&amp;lambda;'''x''') = &amp;lambda;T'''x'''
# ''preserves addition'': T('''x'''+'''y''') = T'''x''' + T'''y'''

Note that not all transformations are linear. Many simple transformations that are in the real world are also non-linear. Their study is more difficult, and will not be done here. For example, the transformation ''S'' (whose input and output are both vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) defined by

&lt;math&gt;S\mathbf{x} = S\begin{pmatrix} x \\
                                     y  \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}  xy\\
                                                                        \cos(y)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can learn about nonlinear transformations by studying easier, linear ones. 

We often ''describe'' a transformation T in the following way
:&lt;math&gt;T : V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;

This means that T, whatever transformation it may be, maps vectors in the vector space V to a vector in the vector space W.

The actual transformation ''could'' be written, for instance, as
:&lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x + y \\ x - y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples and proofs ==
Here are some examples of some linear transformations. At the same time, let's look at how we can prove that a transformation we may find is linear or not.

=== Projection ===
Let us take the projection of vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to vectors on the ''x''-axis. Let's call this transformation T.

We know that T maps vectors from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so we can say 
: &lt;math&gt;T: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;

and we can then write the transformation itself as
: &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly this is linear. (''Can you see why, without looking below?'')

Let's go through a proof that the conditions in the definitions are established.

==== Scalar multiplication is preserved ====
We wish to show that for all vectors '''v''' and all scalars &amp;lambda;, T(&amp;lambda;'''v''')=&amp;lambda;T('''v''').

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ \lambda v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now
:&lt;math&gt; T(\lambda\mathbf{v}) = T\begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ \lambda v_1\end{pmatrix} = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
If we work out &amp;lambda;T('''v''') and find it is the same vector, we have proved our result. 
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda T\mathbf{v}= \lambda \begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
This is the same vector as above, so under the transformation T, ''scalar multiplication is preserved''.

==== Addition is preserved ====
We wish to show for all vectors '''x''' and '''y''', T('''x'''+'''y''')=T'''x'''+T'''y'''.

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 
and
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}=\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now
: &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})=T\left(\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}\right)=&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + y_0 \\ x_1 + y_1 \end{pmatrix} =&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + y_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now if we can show T'''x'''+T'''y''' is this vector above, we have proved this result.
Proceed, then,
:&lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix} + T\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\0 \end{pmatrix}=&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + y_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
So we have that the transformation T ''preserves addition''.

==== Zero vector is preserved ====
Clearly we have 
: &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Conclusion ====
We have shown T preserves addition, scalar multiplication and the zero vector. So T must be linear.

== Disproof of linearity ==
When we want to ''disprove'' linearity - that is, to ''prove'' that a transformation is ''not'' linear, we need only find one counter-example.

If we can find just one case in which the transformation does not preserve addition, scalar multiplication, or the zero vector, we can conclude that the transformation is not linear.

For example, consider the transformation 
: &lt;math&gt; T\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}  x^3 \\ y^2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We suspect it is not linear. To prove it is not linear, take the vector
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
then
: &lt;math&gt; T(2\mathbf{v}) = \begin{pmatrix} 64 \\ 16 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
but
: &lt;math&gt; 2T(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so we can immediately say T is not linear because it doesn't preserve scalar multiplication.

=== Problem set ===
Given the above, determine whether the following transformations are in fact linear or not. Write down each transformation in the form T:V -&gt; W, and identify V and W. (Answers follow to even-numbered questions):
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} v_0^2 + v_1 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ v_0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} v_0 - v_2 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Answers ====
: 2. No. A check whether the zero vector is preserved readily confirms this fact. T : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 4. Yes. T : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Images and kernels ==
We have some fundamental concepts underlying linear transformations, such as the ''kernel'' and the ''image'' of a linear transformation, which are analogous to the ''zeros'' and ''range'' of a function.

=== Kernel ===
The ''kernel'' of a linear transformation T: V -&gt; W is the set of all vectors in V which are mapped to the zero vector in W, ie., 
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ker}\ T = \{v \in V\ |\ T\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Coincidentally because of the matr to the matrix equation A'''x'''='''0'''.

The kernel of a transform T: V-&gt;W is always a subspace of V. The dimension of a transform or a matrix is called the ''nullity''..

=== Image ===
The ''image'' of a linear transformation T:V-&gt;W is the set of all vectors in W which were mapped from vectors in V. For example with the trivial mapping T:V-&gt;W such that T'''x'''='''0''', the image would be '''0'''. (''What would the kernel be?'').

More formally, we say that the image of a transformation T:V-&gt;W is the set
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{im}\ T = \{w \in W\ |\ w=T\mathbf{v}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathbf{v}\in V\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Isomorphism ==

A linear transformation T:V -&gt; W is an isomorphic transformation if it is:
* one-to-one and onto.
* kernel(T) = {0} and the range(T) = W.
* an inverse of T exists.
* dim(V) = dim(W).

Things work much the same here as in wikipedia, except it's a much smaller community here. We've only been going a little while, but we've done a lot already. I don't think we have amunal of sytle yet, but take a look at some of the books already started to get ideas about layout etc.

Re NPOV - I happen to agree with you (For example, in the [[Programming:C]] book, it's important to point out bad techniques in programming in C that lead to awful code). But out-and-out plugging one product over another is hardly in the general &quot;spirit&quot; of NPOV - plugging a product isn't in the spirit of teaching, it's in the spirit of promotion...

But I think perhaps some changes need to be made to [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]], but exactly ''what'' to change will be a sticky area. Strict NPOV works well, but once you relax the restriction then you get a lot of grey area. What if someone is coming to write about the history of Palestine for example, and they add a lot of anti-Israeli sentiment, or vice versa...Is that in the spirit of teaching the correct things? Does that adhere to the &quot;spirit&quot; of NPOV? Very sticky...

Anyway, thanks for your response :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:18, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I noticed a lot of the new pages were commented as &quot;tex extraction/import&quot;... does the licence from wherever they're coming from require noting the source?

:Hello! Thanks for your concern.  I spoke with the author personally at a conference, and he gave me his permission to import his book into wikibooks (knowing that implicitly, this would pass it under the GFDL).  After a few friendly reminders, he sent me the TeX sources, which have never before been released.  Otherwise, the book has been available as PDF under the terms, which I quote here:&lt;blockquote&gt;

::&quot;we grant permission to copy and distribute it for any purpose, '''provided that it is reproduced in its entirety''', including this notice. '''Modified versions may not be distributed without prior concent of the author'''&quot;

::hmmm. The boldfaced sections actually create a rather serious problem, since they don't jibe with the GFDL. Are you sure he understands fully what the GFDL means? Neither of those conditions could legally be applied to a GFDL document. I'd say hold off adding more until he gives consent... sorry about this, but these things are better nipped in the bud. Hopefully he can just change that notice on the copyright, but until he does, it can't be on a GFDL copyrighted server. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

::::OK. If you get a chance to talk to him again, just ask him if he can remove those 2 clauses, or just change the copyright to GFDL. The problem is that the modified versions of this document will in theory be under the GFDL, but if it's based on a document that has a copyright with those clauses, the GFDL would actually violate his copyright. Again, it's all a pain in the butt at first, but it pays off in the end to take care of these things at the beginning, rather than later.

Hey, I noticed you mention that a scientific calculator should give an error and to contact you if it does not. I am using an HP (50G), and I was easily able to calculate the factorial of 1,000. I did have problems in Haskell though (using ghci) with a stack overflow.

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Unused Haskell templates ==

Are the seven Haskell templates at [[Special:Unusedtemplates]] needed anymore? --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 05:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

:No, thanks for pointing them out.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Thank you ==

Assuming you read the staff lounge!  May good karma stay with you - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:33, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Chapter titles in [Linguistics] ==

I didn't revert your changes.  I changed the visible text for two of the sections.  An anonymous editor had changed &quot;How we make words&quot; to &quot;How you make words&quot;, and &quot;Speech sounds go to work&quot; to something like &quot;Speech sound to go work&quot; (I forget the exact change, but it was just pranksterism, regardless).

Your changes seem completely appropriate to me. [[User:ACW|ACW]] 17:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:Oops, my mistake.  I ''did'' revert your changes, but I didn't mean to.  Look at the diffs and you'll see what I had in mind.  I'll try again, and this time I'll do it right, leaving the titles as you had them. I apologize for the goofup. [[User:ACW|ACW]] 17:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

== Featured Books and other Work ==

I just wanted to let you know that i've seen alot of the work you've been doing around here, especially with the featured books templates, and i just wanted to personally thank you for your effort. It's always nice to see new faces working on the same old projects. 

If you need any help with your projects or in general, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:13, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:Hey, thanks for that!  I feel very lucky to always stumble upon the friendliest communities of the net (Haskell, darcs, wikibooks).  I'm actually just looking out for the [[Haskell]] wikibook, but trying to do it in a way that benefits everybody as well.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:16, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

::It's always good to get more programmers around here. Even though wiki is just a text-markup tool, programmers just seem to &quot;get it&quot; more quickly then other editors do. The kinds of things that you are doing with that featured book template are typically reserved for the oldest and most experienced editors, and even many of them can't quite figure out how to use a named template parameter properly. Of course, it doesnt help that some of the wiki syntax is so complicated. Anyway, keep up the good work! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:21, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[Control Systems]] ==

Yeah, i'm fine with the space shuttle for now for the book blurb here. I'll look through commons and see if i can find something a little better, but if not this is okay. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 14:09, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== languages bookshelf ==

Good morning, Kowey. I'm a bit concerned my latest comment on the discussion might get lost on the page, which is starting to look like an overgrown garden, so I'll repeat it here to make sure you see it as it's important:

&quot;Yesterday I placed a request on the template's talk page with intructions for the change. There has not been any response yet. If we decide to implement my and Kowey's proposal for disambiguation pages/templates (for languages with multiple textbooks), the bookshelf template will subsequently need to be updated to reflect that; or if Junesun's alternative proposal of leaving multiple books in the bookshelf template itself is opted for, again that will entail modifications. In this respect, what I have requested (#4) can be considered as &quot;provisional&quot;, but I think it's a step in the right direction. Kowey's disambiguation strategy sounds good to me but it does require &quot;technical&quot; implementation (i.e. somebody still has to make those pages or templates). Kowey, could you yourself either: (1) create them and incorporate them, or (2) failing that, at least create ONE of them for me to see exactly what your proposal looks like, and I can try to do the others following that model if you prefer it that way? Alan&quot;

I also noticed this morning that Xania has reorganised the list of English books on the bookshelf. Quite a list it is too. That might be a good place to start if you would like to try out your idea about the transcluded list strategy. I'd like to see an illustration of how that is going to work... Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:04, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Questionable links ==

Hi Kowey. Would you take a look at the question I've raised at the bottom of [[Wikibooks talk:Languages bookshelf]] and at the links in question? What do you think? If you agree with me, since you've been involved longer than I have with the project perhaps you'd like to say something on the matter? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 21:38, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

Hello again. I see you still haven't responded to/about Lutonia. I didn't incorporate Lutonia's book into the individual-language bookshelf system we recently developed because I wanted to wait and see what would be decided (and avoid any additional work that might have to be undone afterwards). Any thoughts? Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 10:11, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, yeah, sorry about that.  I've been meaning to look into ways we can import his work into wikibooks and find means for him to work with us.  That's the only barrier, really... technical stuff.  The books have no place here until this work is done, however.  If only we could state this in a very positive way that keeps him with us -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:18, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

::I also happen to think that content-wise his books are methodologically highly unsound, although that is probably irrelevant since &quot;censorship&quot; of books on such grounds is not contemplated in Wikibooks. If I were to agree with encouraging him to stay &quot;with us&quot; it would be for purely &quot;ethical&quot; reasons, rather than because I see his work as a useful contribution to the quality (or eventual prestige) of the series. It's not a valid reason for turning him away, either; it's also not, therefore, the reason why I have called the books into question. Given all that, I would explain as delicately as possible the technical problem, but wouldn't go as far as bending over backwards or in any sense &quot;begging&quot; him to &quot;stay&quot;. My opinion for what it's worth. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 17:47, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks for the welcome! ==

Hi Kowey,
Thanks for the welcome to the Haskell wikibook project!  I've been looking for a way to contribute to the Haskell community, and at the moment I've found that the wikibook is a place where I can contribute productively.  You can expect to see lots of edits from me in the near future. =)  I already hang out in #haskell-books some, but I didn't know about the mailing list; I will go subscribe to it. --[[User:Byorgey|Byorgey]] 15:10, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== Thank you + LaTeX ==

Hi Kowey!

Thank you for your welcome message. 
I have added an answer to your comment on my Wikibook
''[[LaTeX/Collaborative_Writing_of_LaTeX_Documents|Collaborative Writing of LaTeX Documents]]''

 
on my [[User_talk:Arnehe|talk page]].

== How did you make those diagrams? ==

I admired the diagrams in your Haskell book. How were they made?

rfrankel

:Hi, I used the MacOS X program OmniGraffle (see also the [[Haskell/Zippers]] chapter with some nice diagrams by [[User:Apfelmus]]).  Some of our diagrams ([[Haskell/Category theory]]) were made using Inkscape, which David House reports to be nice as well.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 04:41, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

The objective of this wikibook, ''A Study Guide to Basic Ecology'', is to give the reader a better understanding of the way life functions on Earth, and how it is organized. This section will introduce basic concepts and definitions required to establish a course that is both biological and ecological in approach. You will learn that there are numerous terms in ecology which basically mean the same thing, and that there are also a plethora of views on precise definitions. As ecology emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries, many concepts of ecological organization were proposed. These came from both zoologists and botanists&amp;mdash;whom seldom read the other's literature&amp;mdash;and from different schools of thought. 
==  Definition of Ecology==
The term '''''oekologie''''' ([[Wikipedia:en:Ecology|ecology]]) was coined in 1866 by the German biologist, [[Wikipedia:en:Ernst_Haeckel|Ernst Haeckel]] from the Greek ''oikos'' meaning &quot;house&quot; or &quot;dwelling&quot;, and ''logos'' meaning &quot;science&quot; or &quot;study&quot;. Thus, ecology is the &quot;study of the household of nature&quot;.  Haeckel intended it to encompass the study of an animal in relation to both the physical environment and other plants and animals with which it interacted.   

A contemporary definition of ecology is: 
&lt;center&gt;
'''''The scientific study of the distribution and abundance of organisms and the interactions that determine distribution and abundance'''''{{ref|Begon2006}}.
&lt;/center&gt;
This definition encompasses not only the plants and animals that Haeckel recognized but microscopic organisms such as [[Wikipedia:en:Bacteria|Bacteria]], [[Wikipedia:en:Archaea|Archaea]] and [[Wikipedia:en:protozoa|protozoa]], as well.  The interactions that determine an organism's distribution and abundance are processes that include energy flow, growth, reproduction, predation, competition and many others.

== Basic Ecology Definitions ==
[[Image:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Ecology''' is essentially the study of the workings of the planet Earth.]]
To fully understand the science of ecology, there are some common terms that must be defined.
The term '''environment''' describes, in an unspecified way, the sum total of physical and biotic conditions that influence an organism (Kendeigh, 1961). The subset of the planet earth ''environment'' into which life penetrates is termed the '''biosphere'''. With respect to the planet earth, the biosphere penetrates only a limited distance into the rock beneath the land and the oceans, and a limited distance out away from the planet towards space.  All human effort so far has failed to demonstrate that the biosphere extends beyond these limits or that other biospheres exist elsewhere in the universe. We cannot therefore conclude that they do not exist, only that we know nothing of that existence. 
'''Ecosystem''' is perhaps the most widely used term in ecology. It is defined as the system of organisms and physical factors under study or consideration. 
Although the boundaries of ecosystems are sometimes quite difficult to define in nature, ecosystems&amp;mdash;however bounded&amp;mdash;comprise the basic units of that nature (Tansley, 1935). '''Habitat''' is generally considered by biologists to be the physical conditions that surround a species, or species population, or assemblage of species, or community (Clements and Shelford, 1939).

The basic physical units of the biosphere are the '''lithosphere''' (the land), '''hydrosphere''' (the water), and '''atmosphere''' (the air). Apparently there is no permanent biota of the atmosphere, although insects and birds among others utilize that environment extensively (Hesse, et al., 1951). These basic units are easily recognized in any '''landscape''', as for example shown in the scene at right from Belarus in Europe.

&lt;big&gt;NOTE:&lt;/big&gt; Definitions of terms used in this textbook have been collected into various glossaries, the basic one being [[../Main Glossary|Basic Ecology Glossary]].

== Scope of Ecology ==
[[Image:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|right|thumb|360px|Tropical woodlands and River Gambia. The surface of the earth is covered by an exceedingly complex biological system capturing energy from sunlight. Availability of water determines the &quot;density&quot; of this system.]]
Humanity has been studying nature for thousands of years and formally for several centuries under the science of biology, so why do we say that Ecology is a relatively new science?  (Note, the term &quot;ecology&quot; is only about 150 years old). What is it that ecologists do or study that biologists might not? Kendeigh (1961, p. 3) wrote that &quot;[e]cology is one of three main divisions of biology; the other two being morphology [organism structural aspects] and physiology [organism functional aspects]&quot;. The behavioral sciences encompass one facet of the interaction of an organism with its physical and biological surroundings, and therefore are part of ecology.

Several techniques are used to study Ecology; one of the methods is known as strong inference.  Strong inference is defined as the method of testing a hypothesis by deliberately attempting to demonstrate the falsity of the hypothesis (Kinraide and Denison, 2003).  Performing experiments is the preferred method of using strong inference.  The point of an experiment is to control variables and/or patterns and to predict the outcomes.  

Traditionally, Ecology is based more on weak inference (the other type of inference) rather than strong inference. In weak inference there are no experiments; rather, there are correlations between observations.  Weak inference is defined as a &quot;common sense&quot; approach using simple system models to build understanding (Elner and Vadas).  

Both weak and strong inference have been used throughout many different science courses over the last several thousands of years (Kinraide and Denison).  However, strong inference is said to be more advantageous because weak inference is more prone to error.  Weak inference makes people try to cling to one point of view; whereas strong inference (doing experimentation) causes people to think from more than one point of view and keep coming up with different hypotheses to test as their old hypotheses get falsified.  

Ecology incorporates and overlaps with many other disciplines in both the biological and physical sciences. Certainly on one level, there is no information about the natural environment that does not have some applicability to ecology. On the other hand, such interrelationships between the sciences are much more the norm than most people realize. Ecology, according to Kendeigh (1961, p. 1), is a distinct science because of the way information about the natural world is organized; and because of its unique methodologies and point-of-view by which knowledge is extracted from such information.
:''Ecology has no aim, but ecologists have. The problems of the ecologist are not fundamentally different from those of any other kind of naturalist. The superficial differences in aim are due to the different points of view, or methods of approach, rather than to any essential differences in the character of the problems'' &amp;mdash; (Charles Adams, 1913; cited in Hedgepeth, 1957). 

It may be helpful here to list the phenomenon that ecologists are particularly interested in if only to better clarify the boundaries of this text covering basic ecology (list modified from Kendeigh, 1961, p 1).  Ecologists study: 
# structural, functional, and behavioral adaptations of organisms in relation to their environment (Chapter 3); 
# interrelationships between species and their populations, and populations in their communities (Chapter 4);
# local and geographic distributions of organisms;
# regional variations in organism abundances;
# temporal changes in the distribution, abundance, and behaviors of organisms; and
# evolution of the interrelationships described.

Ecology is both a biological and an environmental science, something that should certainly be evident from the definition provided above. Many environmental sciences are minimally concerned with biology (meteorology, for example) and others (environmental toxicology, for example) necessarily combine physical and biological sciences. Environmentalism on the other hand is a political position involved with various aspects of managing the environment.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Ecology|Ecology]] (&lt;small&gt;Neither links nor extended (&quot;Main&quot;) articles need be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)

There are many subcategories of Ecology. Plant Ecology looks at the differences and similarities of various plants in differing climates and habitats. The origins of Animal Ecology can be traced to two Europeans, R. Hesse of [[Wikipedia:en:Germany|Germany]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Charles_Sutherland_Elton|Charles Elton]] of [[Wikipedia:en:England|England]] . Physiological Ecology, or [[Wikipedia:en:Ecophysiology|ecophysiology]], studies the responses of the individual organism to the environment. The idea of [[Wikipedia:en:Population_ecology|Population Ecology]] was brought forward by two famous men, [[Wikipedia:en:Charles_darwin|Charles Darwin]], who looked at the similarities and dissimilarites of populations and how they replaced each other over time, and [[Wikipedia:en:Mendel|Gregor Mendel]] . The last subcategory is [[Wikipedia:en:Ecosystem_ecology|Ecosystem Ecology]], which brought about terms such as [[Wikipedia:en:Limnology|limnology]], introduced by A. Thienemann.

== Early History of Ecology ==
Because ecology is a facet of biology, it is not possible to clearly define a time or person that represents the beginning of ecological thought as distinct from biology. One of the first ecologists was probably Theophrastus, a contemporary and student of Aristotle.  Theophrastus described various interrelationships between animals and between animals and their environment as early as the 4th century BC (Ramalay, 1940).

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Theophrastus|Theophrastus]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time except as necessary to clarify points&lt;/small&gt;)

Over the next several centuries biological knowledge gradually expanded as naturalists, such as Bufon and Linnaeus, contributed to a growing understanding of the nature of plants and animals.  These early naturalists of course understood that organisms had a relationship with the environment, and especially that the distribution of forms was related to physical aspects of the geography.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander von Humboldt]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links only as needed to clarify terms and points made&lt;/small&gt;)

The modern ecological concept of integrated communities of organisms began in the 19th century with the studies of August Grisebach (1838), a German botanist.  A contemporary and fellow countryman, Ernst Haeckel, coined the term &quot;ecology&quot; in 1866. Other biologists followed Grisbach's ecological approach to natural history studies: K. Möbius (1877) investigating Danish oyster banks, Stephen A. Forbes (1887), describing a lake community as a microcosm, J. E. B. Warming (1895), describing Danish plant communities, and C. C. Adams conducting ecological stuidies in northern Michigan (1905) and at Isle Royale (1909).

When you take time to consider it, a computer would be pretty useless without some way to talk to the people who use it.  Just like we need information in order to accomplish tasks, so do computers.  And just as we supply information to others so that ''they'' can do tasks, so do computers.

These supplies and returns of information to a computer are called '''input''' and '''output'''.  'Input' is information supplied to a computer or program.  'Output' is information provided by a computer or program.  Frequently, computer programmers will lump the discussion in the more general term ''input/output'' or simply, '''I/O'''.

In C, there are many different ways for a program to communicate with the user.  Amazingly, the most simple methods usually taught to beginning programmers may also be the most powerful. In the [[Programming:C#A taste of C|&quot;Hello, World&quot; example]] at the beginning of this text, we were introduced to a Standard Library file stdio.h, and one of its functions, printf(). Here we discuss more of the functions that stdio.h gives us.


== Output using printf() ==

Recall from the beginning of this text the demonstration program duplicated below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
 int main(void)
 {
    printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
    return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

If you compile and run this program, you will see the sentence below show up on your screen:


{| cellspacing=3
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|bgcolor=lightgrey|
   '''Hello, world!'''
|}

This amazing accomplishment was achieved by using the ''function'' &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt;. A function is like a &quot;black box&quot; that does something for you without exposing the internals inside. We can write functions ourselves in C, but we will cover that later.

You have seen that to use &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; one puts text, surrounded by quotes, in between the parentheses. We call the text surrounded by quotes a ''literal string'' (or just a ''string''), and we call that string an ''argument'' to printf.

As a note of explanation, it is sometimes convenient to include the open and closing parentheses after a function name to remind us that it is, indeed, a function. However usually when the name of the function we are talking about is understood, it is not necessary.

As you can see in the example above, using &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; can be as simple as typing in some text, surrounded by double quotes (note that these are double quotes and not two single quotes). So, for example, you can print any string by placing it as an argument to the &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; function:


{| cellspacing=3
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|bgcolor=lightgrey|
   printf(&quot;This sentence will print out exactly as you see it...&quot;);
|}

And once it is contained in a proper &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function, it will show:


{| cellspacing=3
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|bgcolor=lightgrey|
   '''This sentence will print out exactly as you see it...'''
|}

=== Printing numbers and escape sequences ===
==== Placeholder codes ====
The &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; function is a powerful function, and is probably the most-used function in C programs. 

For example, let us look at a problem. Say we don't know what 19 + 31 is. Let's use C to get the answer.

We start writing

 #include &quot;stdio.h&quot; // this is important, since printf 
                    // can't be used without this line

 int main(void)
 {
    printf(&quot;19+31 is&quot;);

Better write #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
Use #include &quot;file.h&quot; when the *.h file is in the current work directory. 

But here we are stuck! &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; only prints strings! Thankfully, printf has methods for printing numbers. What we do is put a ''placeholder'' format code in the string. We write:

   printf(&quot;19+31 is '''%d'''&quot;, 19+31);

The placeholder %d literally &quot;holds the place&quot; for the actual number that is the result of adding 19 to 31. 

These placeholders are called '''format specifiers'''. Many other format specifiers work with &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt;. If we have a floating-point number, we can use &lt;tt&gt;%f&lt;/tt&gt; to print out a floating-point number, decimal point and all. Other format specifiers are:

*%d  - int      (same as %i)
*%ld - long int (same as %li)
*%f  - float
*%lf - double
*%c  - char
*%s  - string
*%x  - hexadecimal

==== Tabs and newlines ====
What if, we want to achieve some output that will look like:
    '''1905 '''
   '''312 +'''
   '''-----'''

&lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; will not put line breaks in at the end of each statement: we must do this ourselves. But how?

What we can do is use the newline ''escape character''. An escape character is a special character that we can write but will do something special onscreen, such as make a beep, write a tab, and so on. To write a newline we write &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;. All escape characters start with a backslash.

So to achieve the output above, we write
   printf(&quot; 1905\n312 +\n-----\n&quot;);

or to be a bit more clear, we can break this long printf statement over several lines. So our program will be 
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   printf(&quot; 1905\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;312 +\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;-----\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;%d&quot;, 1905+312);
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
There are [[C Programming/Strings#backslash escapes | other escape characters]] we can use. Another common one is to use &lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; to write a tab. You can use &lt;tt&gt;\a&lt;/tt&gt; to ring the computer's bell, but you should not use this very much in your programs, as excessive use of sound is not very friendly to the user.
{{BookCat}}

== Other output methods ==
=== puts() ===

The puts() function is a very simple way to send a string to the screen when you have no placeholders to be concerned about.  It works very much like the printf() function we saw in the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example:

   puts(&quot;Print this string.&quot;);

will print to the screen:

   Print this string.

followed by the newline character (as discussed above).  (The &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function appends a newline character to its output.)

== Input using scanf() ==

The scanf() function is the input method equivalent to the printf() output function - simple yet powerful.  In its simplest invocation, the scanf ''format string'' holds a single ''placeholder'' representing the type of value that will be entered by the user.  These placeholders are exactly the same as the printf() function - %d for ints, %f for floats, and %lf for doubles.

There is, however, one variation to scanf() as compared to printf().  The scanf() function requires the memory address of the variable to which you want to save the input value.  While ''pointers'' are possible here, this is a concept that won't be approached until later in the text.  Instead, the simple technique is to use the ''address-of'' operator, '''&amp;'''. For now it may be best to consider this &quot;magic&quot; before we discuss pointers.  

A typical application might be like this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &quot;stdio.h&quot;

int main(void) 
{
   int a;

   printf(&quot;Please input an integer value: &quot;);
   scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;a);
   printf(&quot;You entered: %d\n&quot;, a);

   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If you were to describe the effect of the scanf() function call above, it might read as: &quot;Read in an integer from the user and store it at the address of variable ''a'' &quot;.

If you are trying to input a ''string'' using ''scanf'', you should '''not''' include the &amp; operator. The code below will not compile.
   scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, &amp;a);

The correct usage would be:
   scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, a);

This is because, whenever you use a format specifier for a string (%s), the variable that you use to store the value will be an array and, the array names (in this case - a) themselves point out to their base address and hence, the '''address of''' operator is not required.

(Although, this is vulnerable to [[w:Buffer overflow|Buffer overflow]]. fgets() is preferred to scanf()).

'''Note on inputs''':  When data is typed at a keyboard, the information does not go straight to the program that is running.  It is first stored in what is known as a '''buffer''' - a small amount of memory reserved for the input source.  Sometimes there will be data left in the buffer when the program wants to read from the input source, and the scanf() function will read this data instead of waiting for the user to type something. Some may suggest you use the function fflush(stdin), which may work as desired on some computers, but isn't considered good practice, as you will see later. Doing this has the downfall that if you take your code to a different computer with a different compiler, your code may not work properly.

I don't think splitting scanf/printf into its own section is a good idea. It's good to have some level of centralization - I'll move te stuff back, you can reply here if you have some disagreement if you like :) 

Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:04, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)



Thanks, Dysprosia.  I have no objection in the general.  It just seemed that the scanf/printf section was going to get very long - between escape sequences, placeholders, etc.  I thought it left a big hole, but figured it could be filled in easily enough.  Don't you think this subsection is going to overwhelm the topic?

Maffu 23:09, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: C's ''simple'' IO system can be covered by just considering scanf and printf for the moment. We can get into the more nitty-gritty stuff with files and getc and fprintf and all that other wonderful stuff in another section :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:11, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)


I guess I was referring to the other simple I/O methods.  Can't get much simpler than gets(), puts(), and cout.  These should at least be mentioned under the &quot;simple&quot; category.   Maffu 23:20, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hello and greatings from the Wikipedia world. I went ahead and moved the C-specific content from the Wikipedia article on printf into the C book here, which it looks like you edit. You can take a look at what I did and move it around if you would like (I added a section to the end of the functions chapter) and linked to a new printf page from there. -- Zach (Zachlipton on Wikipedia).

== Parallèles (Pearson Prentice Hall) ==
Something I would recommend is taking a look at the staging and format of some popular French textbooks. The one I'm currently using is Parallèles. It's March of my second college semester and we're just now getting to lui and leur, yet they're stuck right in the first lesson section, before you've even hit a different tense! I've posted below the chapter contents for the first three chapters in my current book to give an idea of how they do it. (Please excuse me for not using accents, it's hard to do in Firefox!)

*Prèliminaire - Entrée en scène
**Introductions (Bonjour, comment vous appelez-vous, je m'appelle, au revoir, etc.)
**Identification (Qu'est ce que c'est? C'est... Voila... Voici...)
**Le jour, la date, et les nombres cardinaux
**Phonetique: Alphabet, accents et consonnes
*1. Premiers contacts
**People, origin, and profession
**Les pronom sujets; le verbe etre; la negation ne...pas
**Le genre et le nombre a trente, articles definis et indefinis, contractions
**Les verbes en -er; changements orthographiques de quelques verbes en -er (-ger, -cer, -érer)
**Expressions de fréquence (ne...jamais, parfois, etc.) et de quantité (assez, beaucoup, peu, plus)
**Questions oui/non (intonation, est-ce que, n'est-ce pas)
*2. On rejoint la communaute francophone
**Le verbe avoir; l'expression il y a
**Les mots de la famille
**Les adjectifs reguliers: accord et place
**Les nombres cardinaux de 31 a un millard
**Questions d'information (Combien, Comment, Pourquoi, etc.); inversion

As you can see, they take it rather slowly. I think that if we're going to create a dynamite wikibook, we'll want to follow a similar pattern. In between all of that, they add tons of culture, stories, etc. 

I am a writer by nature, but very, very limited in my French ability. I would be more than willing to work with someone or different people to add flavor text to the wikibook (such as conversations, stories, characters, etc) if they could translate for me? (Granted, I'm certain there are people who could do that themselves without having to go through English to get there.) I would guess it might help, though, to produce French from an Anglophone learner's perspective. --[[User:Averykrouse|Averykrouse]] 04:49, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Yes, I don't really like the organization of the first four lessons (1. Intorductions, 2. Gender, Subject pronouns, 3.Date and Time, 4. Description). Your book has the alphabet and pronunciation, which we have in our introduction, as part of a general preliminary lesson. Maybe we should combine the &quot;reading French&quot; lesson with lesson 1. We defintately need to reorganize from the introduction to lesson 1.4.  

Right now level one covers the present tense, etre, avoir, and faire, and basic pronouns. Could you make a list of all the grammar your book covers other than tenses and irregular verbs?

We're horribly lacking in stories and conversations. Luckily, Merrheim, a native French speaker, has agreed to write stories for each lesson, so the book would improve at least a little in that regard. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 16:14, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

ps. Remeber alt + 1 3 0 on the numpad for é, which is where most accents are used. For the others, use the &quot;insert&quot; box below the editor. The first set is accent aigu, the second accent grave, and the third the carot marks.
----
As far as grammar specifically is concerned, here is the rundown by chapter. (I went ahead and listed the tenses and verbs as well because that is one area that I'd like to address in our organization styles. I've also given the general topic used in each chapter to exemplify the vocab used as it relates to the grammar.)

P. L'alphabet, accents et consonnes, le jour et la date (avec les nombres cardinaux de 1 à 30)

1. (Indentifying people, objects, and daily activities) Les pronoms sujets, le verbe être, la négation ne...pas; &lt;br&gt;le genre et le nombre, articles définis et indéfinis; contractions; &lt;br&gt;les verbes en -er, changements orthographiques de quelquesverbes en -er; &lt;br&gt;Questions oui / non (intonation, est-ce que, n'est-ce pas); &lt;br&gt; syllabation et liason

2. (Describing personality, tastes, family, friends) Le verbe avoir, l'expression il y a; &lt;br&gt;Les adjectifs réguliers: accord et place; &lt;br&gt;Les nombres cardinaux de 31 à un milliard; &lt;br&gt;Questions d'information; inversion

3. (A tour of France, weather, seasons) Les adjectifs qui précèdent le nom; &lt;br&gt;Le verbe faire; &lt;br&gt;Le verbe aller et le futur proche; &lt;br&gt;L'adjectif interrogatif quel; l'adjectif démonstratif ce

4. (City life, directions, and shops) Les adjectifs possessifs (ma, tes, notre, etc); &lt;br&gt;L'impératif et le conditionnel de politesse (je voudrais, je pourrais only); &lt;br&gt;Les verbes réguliers en -re, le verbe prendre;

5. (A person's physical features, personality, and character) Les verbes réguliers en -ir, les verbes comme ouvrir; &lt;br&gt;Adjectifs irréguliers, les pronoms toniques, c'est vs. il est/elle et; &lt;br&gt;Le passé composé avec avoir; &lt;br&gt;Le comparatif et le superlatif de l'adjectif

6. (House, furnishings, chores, and daily routines) Les verbes partir, sortir, dormir; &lt;br&gt;Le verbe venir, le passé récent; &lt;br&gt;Les verbes pronominaux au présent et à l'impératif

''(This point is where first semester college French ends and second begins in this book.)''

7. (Food, shopping, and table manners) L'article partitif, révision de l'article défini et indéfini (le café vs. du café, etc); &lt;br&gt;Les verbes mettre, boire, et recevoir; &lt;br&gt;Expressions de quantité; &lt;br&gt;Les verbes pronominaux au passé composé

8. (Holidays, events, memories) Les pronoms relatifs qui et que; &lt;br&gt;L'imparfait (description); &lt;br&gt;L'imparfait (habitudes); &lt;br&gt;Les verbes vouloire, pouvoire, et devoir

9. (de lycée) Les verbes connaître, savoir, et suivre; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms compléments d'objet direct; &lt;br&gt;La narration au passé: l'imparfait vs. le passé composé; &lt;br&gt;Les expressions de temps depuis, il y a, pendent

10. (la fac, university life) Les verbes dire, lire, et écrire; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms compléments d'objet indirect; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms y et en; &lt;br&gt;Le conditionnel

11. (careers, clothes) Les pronoms interrogatifs; &lt;br&gt;Le pronom interrogatif lequel; &lt;br&gt;Les verbes croire et voir; &lt;br&gt;Le présent du subjonctif: verbes réguliers, les expressions impersonnelles d'obligation

12. (travel and leisure) Les noms géographiques et les prépositions; &lt;br&gt;Le subjonctif d'être et d'avoir, l'emploi du subjonctif après les expressions de volonté; &lt;br&gt;Le sobjonctif des verbes irréguliers; &lt;br&gt;Le subjonctif après les expressions d'émotion

13. (heath and the environment) Les adverbes, le comparatif et le superlatif de l'adverbe; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms indéfinis; &lt;br&gt;L'emploi du subjonctif après certaines conjonctions; &lt;br&gt;Le futur

Voilà! --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 21:12, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the list. Sections we could have:

*contractions - in French? what kind of contractions?
*L'adjectif interrogatif quel; l'adjectif démonstratif ce
*changements orthographiques de quel
*Les pronoms compléments d'objet direct - what are these?
*L'impératif et le conditionnel de politesse (je voudrais, je pourrais only) - Basic introductions to tenses might be a very good idea.
*Les expressions de temps depuis, il y a, pendent - definately add to level two
*Questions d'information; inversion

I think that level one is way too early for the subjunctive and the more difficult pronouns like lequel. I also don't view lui and leur as anything special that takes more than five minutes to learn. 

Anyway, I'm interested in hearing your views on the progression. I think having the difficulty level increase is the best course. If you haven't done so already, check the structure lesson on the planning page. If you have a better structure, we should reorganize as soon as possible. On a related note, would copying the organization straight out of a book be any kind of legal infringement? --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 00:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
----
Actually, I would say that just the organization structure itself wouldn't be an infringement on copyright. If we're dividing those fourteen chapters into three sections (perhaps Étages or Étapes), the chapter numbering wouldn't even match up. And for the flavor text, I would highly recommend a theme per chapter, but we could probably use different themes than the ones they use. (They also focus a lot on French / American parallels (hence the name) and connections to other Francophone places.)

In general, it's important to give things one at a time. One tense at a time, one irregular at a time, one regular set at a time, one pronoun at a time, etc, especially considering that if a student gets lost in the first chapter, they wouldn't carry anything over to build with in the second chapter, and so forth.

To make it more presentable as a textbook, I would definitely like to see more dialogues, character profiles, etc. (Wow, I just had a great idea!) Let's introduce a character. Luc Beauchamp, let's say. And we see him start in a new college (introductions, basic vocabs, etc.) to lycée (friends, interactions, after school stuff), to the bac (testing, adjectives, careers), to the fac (college life), to graduation (reminiscing about old times = l'imparfait!), to choosing a career (the conditional), to starting a family, and so forth. It gives us clear story lines, something the reader can relate to, and a format to work towards when adding the meat of the chapter. The bones are the bones one way or the other, grammar is grammar, but vocabulary and comprehension is the meat.

What do you think? Something we could flesh out, maybe using the above grammar outline to format around? --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 07:18, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
----
The problem with giving tenses and verbs one at a time is that later on you can't. For example, ~4 verbs are conjugated irregularly in the subjunctive, and ~10 more have irregular stems. 40 verbs have irregular passé simple stems. (See [[French/Lessons/Revolution%21|the section]]). The verbs that were irregular in the present indicative will for the most part be irregular in all the other tenses, and you can't devote a chapter to each verb. The book ''has to'' get more rigorous as it progresses. 

But I wholeheartedly agree to starting off as simply as possible. Level one has one regular set/irregular verb section and one misc grammar section in each lesson. Level two has 3-4 irregular verbs per lesson. After level two, we're done with introducing new irregular verbs.

I also agree with guiding the reader and explaining things rather than simply showing vocabulary charts. The problem is that we need  to introduce the grammar and vocabulary first. Level one should be mostly vocabulary, and four mostly prose French. There should also be just as many practice exercises as sections and a test for each lesson. Things like dialogues should be included to force the reader to go back and reread vocabulary and grammar.

As for Luc, I think that's a great idea and will make the course a lot more interesting. If we follow the current structure, level one could be the summer before he goes to university, where Luc describes himself, we meet his family and see his house, watch him play with his friends, take trips to the science and art museum, etc. Level two could be Luc in university, where we learn about his daily life. Level three could be Luc taking a vacation before going to an interview and getting a job, and later having a kid of his own.

Finally, I'm for whatever book organization you feel is best. To see another French book as an example, go [http://www.glencoe.com/sec/worldlanguages/french/ose/index.html here] and enter user: BONVL105  and pass: w6pUtRux for level 1 and user: BONVL205 pass: yaN6pRef  for level two. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 09:06, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
----
During the next few days I should have all the grammar sections completed and expanded, so we won't have to worry about that anymore, or at least until level four. I've pretty much given all the vocabulary I have so either someone else will have to finish [[French/Lessons/Planning#Lesson_To-Do|what's left]] or we'll just use basic Google translations. Whatever book organization we choose, we'll still have the same grammar and vocabulary, so that will be taken care of. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 09:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)
----
One of the comments I would make is that it's not necessary to devote a chapter to each verb, just make sure that the basic verbs are covered well, and as we get to harder tenses and different irregulars, group them in simple sets. Partir/sortir/dormir, vouloir/pouvoir, etc. With tenses, I don't see it that necessary to place every single irregular stem in the page, just a good selection of frequently used ones. Then, we should have a chart of verbs (one each for er, re, and ir, then for each orthographic group like cer and ger, then for each of the irregular verbs we've presented (and a handful extra)). After all, this is just a textbook designed to take the reader through approximately three semesters worth of French, correct?

Also, for vocabulary, let's try and make a balance between pure vocab lists, contextually-learned vocab (vocab placed inside of stories and dialogues), and sets of examples (Luc se coucher. Il se leve. Il s'habille. Etc.) The way my book does it is to do the dialogues and stories and whatnot and at the end of each section, have a list of new vocab that was used in that section, so that you end up with a handful of vocab lists in each chapter. That way, anything the student didn't catch in context they can pick up manually. --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 01:55, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

Also also, we need to consider the dialogues that are already in place. For example, the two at the end of the introductory lesson contain reflexive pronouns, imperfect tense, etc. This is way too far ahead for introductory. The general rule for staging this kind of thing ought be: 80% What they already have, 15% what they will get next, 5% other vocabulary (often with translated citations). Right now, the students should be able to learn both by rote and by context. The dialogues and stories become useless when they would require an outside source to translate them (if only because most people aren't going to go to that much trouble). We have to consider that right now, most of our readers will be learning on their own. We should be as explanatory as possible, at least throughout the first lesson, including lots of full sentence French examples with full sentence English translations. --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 02:06, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

Ideally, this course should teach dedicated and hard-working readers to speak the language fluently. By the end of level four, all French grammar will be covered in depth. Five should be conducted in French. The Glencoe books I've linked to commonly have grammar that hasn't been formally taught, but that translates straightforwardly. Other grammar should be included, but with footnote translations. I completely agree with everything else you said. As for what we should do now, first we should get the core content (grammar and vocabulary) done, then we can build around that complete all-encompassing lessons. The student should never have to leave the book (or ideally the lesson) to look anything up. 

The higher level Glencoe books have texts accompanying chapters structured as introduction/context, vocabulary for the text, the text, questions on the text. I have started one to accompany the Revolution lesson, found [[French/Lessons/Revolution!/Text|here]]. We should have many more of these in the later levels. Finally, I would like to ask you to write English introductions to the beginning lessons, since I know you can right a lot better than I can. We're making progress! --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 03:40, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

One more thing: how do you think we should handle grammar review? The Glencoe books did this by combining lessons from the previous book. For example a tense learned in three lessons in the previous book would be reviewed in one lesson in the next. The new grammar lessons would also be the bigger size. The third Glencoe book is almost all grammar review. We could follow that example, which is what I did, or we could have a review lesson at the end of each level before the test, like the German Wikibook, since our levels aren't separate year courses. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 04:45, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of '''power series''' is aimed at investigating series which can approximate some function over a certain interval.{{Wikipedia|Power series = }}

== Motivations ==
Elementary calculus ([[Calculus/Differentiation|differentiation]]) is used to obtain information on a line which touches a curve at one point (i.e. a tangent). This is done by calculating the gradient, or slope of the curve, at a single point. However, this does not provide us with reliable information on the curve's actual ''value'' at given points in a wider interval. This is where the concept of power series becomes useful.

===An example===
&lt;!-- needs a pic --&gt;
Consider the curve of ''y'' = cos(''x''), about the point ''x'' = 0. A naïve approximation would be the line ''y'' = 1. However, for a more accurate approximation, observe that cos(''x'') looks like an inverted parabola around ''x'' = 0 - therefore, we might think about which parabola could approximate the shape of cos(''x'') near this point. This curve might well come to mind:

&lt;math&gt;y = {1 - { x^2 \over 2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this is the best estimate for cos(''x'') which uses polynomials of degree 2 (i.e. a highest  term of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) - but how do we know this is true? This is the study of power series: finding optimal approximations to functions using polynomials.

== Definition ==
A ''power series'' (in one variable) is a infinite [[Calculus/Series|series]] of the form

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=a_0 (x-c)^0+a^1 (x-c)^1 +a_2 (x-c)^2... &lt;/math&gt;(where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant)

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infin} a_j(x-c)^j&lt;/math&gt;

== Radius of convergence ==
When using a power series as an alternative method of calculating a function's value, the equation
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infin} a_j(x-c)^j&lt;/math&gt;
can only be used to study ''f''(''x'') where the power series converges - this may happen for a finite range, or for all [[w:Real_number|real numbers]].

The size of the interval (around its center) in which the power series converges to the function is known as the ''radius of convergence''.

===An example===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n &lt;/math&gt; (a geometric series)
this converges when | ''x'' | &lt; 1, the range -1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; +1, so the radius of convergence - centered at 0 - is '''1'''. It should also be observed that at the ''extremities'' of the radius, that is where ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = -1, the power series does not converge.

===Another example===
:&lt;math&gt;e^x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
Using the [[Calculus/Series#Ratio test|ratio test]], this series converges when the ratio of successive terms is less than one:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{x^\left(n+1\right)}{\left(n+1\right)!}\frac{n!}{x^n}\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{x^n x^1}{n! \left(n+1\right)}\frac{n!}{x^n}\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{n \to \infty}\left|\frac{x}{n+1}\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;
which is always true - therefore, this power series has an infinite radius of convergence. In effect, this means that the power series can ''always'' be used as a valid alternative to the original function, e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Abstraction===
If we use the ratio test on an arbitrary power series, we find it converges when
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infin} \frac{|a_{n+1}x|}{|a_n|} &lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;
and diverges when
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infin} \frac{|a_{n+1}x|}{|a_n|} &gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;
The radius of convergence is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;r=\lim_{n \to \infin} \frac{|a_n|}{|a_{n+1}|}&lt;/math&gt;
If this limit diverges to infinity, the series has an infinite radius of convergence.

==Differentiation and Integration==
Within its radius of convergence, a power series can be differentiated and integrated term by term.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_jx^j = 
\sum_{j=0}^\infty a_{j+1}(j+1)(x-c)^j&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j(x-c)^j dx = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_{j-1}(x-c)^j}{j}+k&lt;/math&gt;

Both the differential and the integral have the same radius of convergence as the original series.

This allows us to sum exactly suitable power series. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+x}=1-x+x^2-x^3+ \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
This is a geometric series, which converges for | ''x'' | &lt; 1. Integrating both sides, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\ln (1+x) = x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3} \ldots &lt;/math&gt;
which will also converge for | ''x'' | &lt; 1. When ''x'' = -1 this is the harmonic series, which ''diverges'; when ''x'' = 1 this is an alternating series with diminishing terms, which ''converges'' to ln 2 - this is testing the extremities.

It also lets us write series for integrals we cannot do exactly such as the error function:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-x^2}=\sum (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
The left hand side can not be integrated exactly, but the right hand side can be.
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^z e^{-x^2}dx=\sum  \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)n!}&lt;/math&gt;
This gives us a series for the sum, which has an infinite radius of convergence, letting us approximate the integral as closely as we like.

Note that this is not a power series, as the power of z is not the index.

Note that ''quitter'' must be followed by a direct object, usually a room or building.

== {{French/Section|Usage notes|To reside|Habiter}} ==

{{fr|Habiter|IPA=/a.bi.te/|audio=Fr-habiter.ogg}}, meaning ''to inhabit'', ''to dwell'', or ''to reside'', is used to say in what city or area you live:
: {{fr|Où habitez-vous ? J'habite à Paris.|en=Where do you live? I live in Paris.}}
: {{fr|Ils habitent à la ville, mais nous habitons à la campagne.|en=They live in the city, but we live in the country.}}
: {{fr|Ils habitent en ville, mais nous habitons en banlieue.|en=They live downtown, but we live in the suburb.}}

''Habiter'' is also used more specifically:
: {{fr|L’homme habite un appartement crasseux et sombre.|en=The man lives in a dirty, dark apartment.}}
: {{fr|Elle habite dans une maison neuve.|en=She lives in a new house.}}

''Habiter rue …'' is used to state on what street a person lives:
: {{fr|J'habite Rue Lecourbe.|en=I live on Lecourbe Street.}}
: {{fr|Il habite Rue de Rennes.|en=He lives on Rennes Street.}}

''Habiter'' refers to occupying a location, and does not mean ''to live'' more generally. (The irregular ''vivre'' is used instead.)

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To do|Faire}} ==

The verb ''faire'' is translated to ''to do'' or ''to make''. It is irregularly conjugated (it does not count as a regular ''-re'' verb).

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Object pronouns ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous''}} ==

The direct object pronouns ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' mean ''me'', ''you'', and ''us'':
: {{fr|Il te donne un livre.|en=He's giving you a book.}}

''Me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' are also indirect object pronouns, and mean ''to me'', ''to you'', and ''to us'':
: {{fr|Ils nous parlent.|en=They're speaking to us.}}

These pronouns come before the verb they modify:
: {{fr|Il vous aime.|en=He likes you.}}
: {{fr|Il aime vous parler.|en=He likes to talk to you.}}

''Me'' becomes ''m&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''te'' becomes ''t&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' before a vowel:
: {{fr|Il t'aime.|en=He likes you.}}
: {{fr|Il aime t'écouter.|en=He likes to listen to you.}}

=== Summary ===
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Me, te, nous, and vous.ogg}}

== {{French/Section|Usage notes|In|Dans|supplementary-id=french-dans-usage-notes}} ==
&lt;div id='french-dans-usage-notes'&gt;
The preposition {{fr|dans|IPA=/dɑ̃/|audio=Fr-dans.ogg}} means ''in'' or ''into'', in the sense of ''inside'', ''from outside'', or ''to inside'':
: {{fr|Il habite dans le quartier le plus riche de Paris.|en=He lives in (inside) the richest district of Paris.}}

{{fr|Dans}} also means ''in'' in the sense of ''within a period of time'':
: {{fr|Il fait deux fois plus d’ouvrage que son frère dans le même temps.|en=He does two times more work than his brother in the same time.}}

As in English, {{fr|dans}} describes abstract situations and state:
: {{fr|Il est dans les larmes.|en=He is in tears.}}

{{fr|Dans}} can also mean ''out of'' or ''from'':
: {{fr|Il prend le beurre dans le réfrigérateur.|en=He takes the butter out of the refrigerator.}}

The preposition {{fr|en}} is used instead to indicate ''in'' in other senses.

The lesson says about the preterite: &quot;...note that the nosotros form is the same as in the present tense...&quot;. Then it gives the example verb &quot;comer&quot;. the preterite for &quot;nosotros&quot; is &quot;comimos&quot;, but the present tense is &quot;comemos&quot;, with ''E''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CJROmaniustreet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca, Romania]]&lt;br/&gt;

'''Romanian''' is a Romance language spoken mainly in [[w:Romania|Romania]] and [[w:Moldova|Moldova]], as well as in some parts of [[w:Hungary|Hungary]], [[w:Serbia|Serbia]], [[w:Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[w:Ukraine|Ukraine]]. It is part of the '''Romance''' group of the [[w:Indoeuropean|Indoeuropean]] family of languages. It is easiest to learn if someone already knows a related language such as Spanish, Catalan, French, Galician, Portuguese or Italian.

The most closely related are the other Romance languages, [[w:Italian language|Italian]] being the closest, but any knowledge of Spanish, French, Galician or Portuguese might be very useful, especially because of the lexical and vocabulary similarities and the grammatical structure. A bit of knowledge of the Latin grammar might be useful as well.

Even more distant Indo-European languages have many similarities in both grammar and even common words, as many languages, like English have borrowed extensively words from Latin.

It is useful to know the language if travelling in Romania, especially in rural areas.  Many people who know English and Romanian will understand any of its relatives, especially Spanish, French or Italian. 

Note that in Romanian, there is a formal and informal form when addressing people. The informal is '''tu''' (you - singular) and '''voi''' (also you - plural). Use '''tu''' when addressing friends or people you know well. When addressing strangers, use '''Dumneavoastr&amp;#259;''' or '''v&amp;#259;'''. Dumneavoastr&amp;#259; is used for stressed pronouns, which are optional, ''v&amp;#259;'' is used for non-stressed pronouns, which are mandatory for direct and indirect objects.  For instance, '''V&amp;#259; multumesc''' means &quot;Thank you&quot; (accusative case, direct object), and '''V&amp;#259; dau un telefon''' means &quot;I telephone (to) you&quot; (dative case, indirect object) The formal form of address requires the second person plural form of the verb at all times, even when addressing a single person. (This is similar to the French construction, and, to an extent, German.) Using the singular form can be considered rude or even insulting.

Do you have capability to record stuff in the OGG file format ? Its a bit obscure but would be ideal for the site because we try to use all open source solutions, and the OGG format is the open source sound file format. By the way, your English sounds very good. 

:Of course I can record in OGG. I can record in Speex too, as I have experimented with them a lot.

Hi Oaso. I've just look over your comments page and I'd like to make a suggestion. Firstly I know nothing of Spanish so I can't agree of disagree with your comments but I would advise you to just go ahead and make the changes to the lessons. I know it's a bit daunting to just change other peoples work, but really that's the whole point of this site! Just go ahead and improve the lessons directly. That is a much more constructive use of your time than writing out comments. Don't worry about others not agreeing with you. They can very easily revert any changes you make with a couple of clicks, so you won't ruin anything, and nobody will hate you :-)   [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:36, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Thanks for the advise. The problem is that I don't have enough on-line time to do all the changes. I use a dial-up connection and the telephone service is not a cheap thing in Guatemala. That's why I downloaded all the lessons, saved them in my hard disk, then I review them, write the comments and upload the whole thing so someone else do the changes. Also there are some things that are meant for discussion.

[[User:Oaso|Oaso]] 21:26, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::The phone costs are quite understanable Oaso, I'm really glad for all your suggestions and I'll put them into the pages as good as I can. One option that might work also is that you click on an edit-page of a text and copy all the plain text to your hard disk. Then you can go off-line and make all the changes to the plain text. When you are done you can go online again and simply paste your editted version in (I use that strategy often, not so much because of phone costs but because sometimes the wiki server is down and all the edits will be gone if they are not saved on my harddisk). But in any case, if you want to keep writing comment pages that's fine for me, I appreciate all your feedback for the Spanish book. Thanks! [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Oaso. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Oaso~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hello, Angela. Thank you for responding so quickly to my request for 'crat'ship. I have some questions:
# How can I edit the MediaWiki namespace (or whatever you call it)? E.g. if I want to change &quot;''Wikibooks:Help''&quot; to &quot;''Викиучебник:Help''&quot;.
# Would it be better (I heard it works faster) to edit LanguageRu.php instead of the namespace?
#* If yes, how can I do that?&lt;br /&gt;[[:ru:Участник:Ramir]]. (someone has changed the ''User:'' namespace name!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are '''six''' different types of syllables in the English language.

#'''Closed:''' ends in a consonant, has a '''short''' vowel sound
#'''Open:''' does '''not''' end in a '''consonant''', has a '''long''' vowel sound  
#'''Vowel-consonant-&quot;E&quot;:''' This syllable is only found at the end of a word. The final &quot;e&quot; is silent and makes next vowel before it long. 
#'''Diphthong:''' two vowels next to each other that together create a new sound and '''Vowel team:''' two pronounced vowels next to each other
#'''Consonant-&quot;LE&quot;:''' 
#''' Power-&quot;R&quot;:''' a syllable where a vowel is followed by the letter &quot;r&quot;. The &quot;r&quot; takes control of the vowel and changes the way that it is pronounced. 

'''Schwa:''' This can end in a consonant or not, and is an unemphasized syllable whose vowel is somewhat swallowed and pronounced like &quot;uh&quot;. Other syllable types can be reclassified as a schwa based on experience of how a word is regionally pronounced. 

In a dictionary, the schwa sound is written like an upside-down, lower case &quot;e&quot;.

==Long and short vowels==
Long vowels are the same sound as the name of the vowel, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;. 

Short vowels are the hardest vowel sounds to pronounce in English. &quot;ah&quot; as in cat, &quot;eh&quot; as in pet, &quot;ih&quot; as in sit, &quot;oo&quot; as in not, &quot;uh&quot; as in nut.

So far we have looked at the effect of putting a current in a magnetic field and seeing that there is a force on the wire that carries the current. On this page we will look at a related effect known as ''induction''.

The best way to learn about induction is to consider the results of a simple experiment. In fact if your school has a spot galvanometer, you should really take a look at these results ''in the flesh''. Otherwise you'll just have to take my word for it.

==Experimental set up to demonstrate induction==


Look at the diagram below. A coil of wire (solenoid) is attached to the inputs of a spot galvanometer. The solenoid can be made by winding a piece of plastic coated wire a round a paper tube. 

A spot galvanometer (also known as a mirror galvanometer) looks like a fancy piece of kit, and it is pretty fancy, delicate and expensive, but it does a very simple job. It's really just a very sensitive ammeter. It measures current just like any other ammeter but is much more sensitive than the normal sort you usually see. It can detect ''tiny'' currents.

The only other thing that is needed is an ordinary bar magnet.





[[Image:Induction_shown_on_a_spot_galvanometer.png]]

===Experimental results===

So, once the apparatus has been set up as in the diagram above, we can look and see what happens.



{| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ededff&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | '''&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt; What was done&lt;/font&gt;'''
| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | '''&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;What was observed to happen &lt;/font&gt;'''
|-
| The magnet is moved ''into'' the coil.
| The spot deflects to the left indicating that a small current is flowing.
|-
|-
| The magnet is left inside the coil.
| The spot comes back to the middle showing the that no current is flowing.
|-
| The magnet is pulled out of the coil.
| The spot deflects to the right indicating that there is a current flowing again but this time in the opposite direction.
|-
| The experiment is repeated except this time the magnet is inserted into the coil very slowly.
| There is still a deflection but this time it's much less than before indicating a smaller current is flowing.
|-
| The magnet is turned around.
| The results are the same as above except the deflections are reversed.
|-
| The magnet is kept still but the coil is moved.
| The results are as above.
|}

===Conclusions===
#If there is relative ''movement'' between a coil of wire and a magnet, there will be a current induced in the coil.
#The faster the movement the bigger the current.
#Reversing the magnet, or the direction of movement reverses the direction of the induced current.

'''Q1)''' What effect will reversing the magnet '''and''' the direction of movement have on any induced current ?

==Theoretic explanation of what's going on (Advanced)==
So now we know what happens we have to come up with an explanation. Look at the diagram below.


[[Image:Induction_in_a_wire_crossing_a_magnetic_field.png]]

In this diagram the green line represents a wire that is going into the screen or page. It is at right angles to the magnetic field between the two bar magnets. The is moved downwards so that it &quot;cuts&quot; the field lines. This induces an e.m.f. (voltage) across the length of wire. It is this e.m.f. that causes a current to flow if a complete circuit is made. So now we know why you get a current. It's caused by the induced voltage, but why do you get a voltage?

Look at the diagram below. 


[[Image:Induction_in_a_wire_magnified_view.png]]

This is a close up of the wire seen end on. The blue circles represent where the magnetic field lines stick out of the screen or page. They are coming straight out of the screen. 

The wire is made of a metal and so has many free electrons. As the wire moves downwards each individual electron travels downwards too. They effectively form loads of little current flowing down. From the motor effect we know that if a current flows in a magnetic field there will be a force. in this case the force pushes the electrons to the right. It is the electrons all moving up to the right end of the wire that causes the voltage difference.

So you see, Induction is really the motor effect.

'''Q2)''' A student uses a stronger magnet. What effect do you think this will have on any induced current?

'''Q3)''' Imagine more than one loop of wire cutting through the magnetic field.Each loop of wire has its own e.m.f. induced on it. If the wires are joined up, it's as if they are little cells in series. Fill in the blanks &quot;&lt;font color=aa22aa&quot;&gt; '''As the number of windings on the solenoid ''increases'' the value of the induced voltage ______________.'''&lt;/font&gt;

'''Q4)''' An engineer want's to uses the induction to create electrcity. He gets a couple of students to push an enormous magnet into and out of a huge coil (he uses a whip to make 'em go fast). In what way will the electricity that this set up produces be different to a the electricity produced by a battery?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transformers are devices that use induction to transform a high a.c. voltage to a low one or vice versa. They are incredibly important devices, and (even more importantly) they are examiners' favourites. On this page you will be looking at how a transformer works and how they are used. You will also be given some practice in using some simple equations that let you work out what the output voltage and current must be.

==How a transformer works== 

There is nothing new to learn in this section. You've already covered [[GCSE Science/Magnetic effects of a current]] and [[GCSE Science/Induction]]. This section used ideas from those two pages to understand a transformer.

The simplest transformer consists of a soft iron core with two coils of wire independently wrapped around it. The first coil called the ''primary coil'' is connected to an a.c. power supply. The other coil, called the ''secondary coil'' is connected to the output.

The current in the primary coil causes a magnetic field. It's just an electromagnet but because the current is a.c. the magnetic field is constantly changing. If we consider one end of the soft iron core, it's first a north pole, then the field gets weaker and weaker until it becomes zero, then it starts to build up and the end becomes a south pole. The process repeats and the end becomes a north pole again.

Now let's think about what is going on in the secondary coil. The magnetic field of the first coil passes right through the secondary coil, what's more the field is constantly changing. This changing field induces a current in the secondary coil. So even though the coils are not physically connected, the current in one, causes the current through the other.

If you imagine the lines of field they appear to pulse as the field grows stronger and weaker. When the field grows weak they sweep inwards cutting the secondary coil.

'''Q1)''' What would the current in the secondary coil be like if you used d.c. in the primary coil? - d.c. in the primary coil will not create any current in the secondary coil.

Transformers are used to change the voltage.  If the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than the number of turns in the primary coil, then the voltage in the secondary coil will be higher than that in the primary coil.  This is called a ''step-up transformer''.  Conversely, if the secondary coil has fewer turns than the primary coil, then the voltage will be lower, and it is called a ''step-down transformer''.

==A simple demonstration transformer==

Your teacher may show you a demonstration of a transformer. (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_a_transformer here] for details on how to set up a simple transformer). Look at the diagram below.


The second coil is on a separate soft iron core. This core can be brought up to the primary coil. At large distances the bulb is off, but as the coils are brought closer together they suddenly attract one another (the primary coil is a powerful electromagnet). Once the two cores are stuck together the bulb in the secondary coil starts to glow. The brighness of the bulb depends on the number of turns on the secondary coil. The more windings there are, the brighter the bulb.

==Important equations==
There are two things you need to remember about transformers.

* The '''voltage''' in the secondary coil depends on the voltage in the primary coil ''and'' the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary and primary coils.
: If we call:
** the voltage in and number of turns in the primary V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
** the voltage in and number of turns in the secondary V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
: then 
:::::: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;= N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

: or, rearranging:
:::::: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;= V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

* Similarly, the '''current''' in the secondary coil depends on the current in the primary coil ''and'' the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary and primary coils.  However, the current is inversely related to the number of turns.
: If we call:
** the current in and number of turns in the primary I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
** the current in and number of turns in the secondary I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
: then 
:::::: I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;= N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

: or, rearranging:
:::::: I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;= I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

* The power in the primary is equal to the power in the secondary (assuming a '''perfect''' transformer). This is because energy is never created or destroyed.
:::::: I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

==Step up and Step down transformers==
Because the voltage in the secondary coil depends on the number of turns, we can use a transformer to ''transform'' one voltage to another. For example let's assume that the primary coil has 300 turns of wire and the secondary coil has 900 turns. This transformer will step up the voltage by a factor of 3. So if the primary coil has 2V applied to it, the secondary coil will have 6V across it.

A step down transformer is the opposite of a step up transformer. Let's say the primary has 900 turns and the secondary has 450 turns. This time the voltage will be half on the secondary as it is on the primary. So if the primary has 2V applied, the secondary will have only 1V across it.

===Strategy for answering questions===
Questions on transformers will often be of the form &quot;A coil has 3000 turns of wire on a soft iron. Another coil of 12000 turns is brought into contact with the first coil. This second coil has a 12V bulb attached to it completing a circuit.What voltage should applied to the first coil?&quot;

to answer a question like this:

# '''Decide which is the primary coil and which is the secondary'''-in this case the 3000 turn coil is the primary and the 12000 turn coil is the secondary
# '''Decide if it is a step up or a step down transformer''' in this case it is a step up transformer because the secondary coil has more turns on it than the primary.
# '''Work out a multiplication factor''' in this case 12000/3000 = 4
# '''Use this multiplication factor to work out the required voltage''' - the secondary coil has to supply 12V so the primary has to be 12V/4 = 3V

==Uses of transformers==

The most important use of transformers is in the routing of mains electricity. The power disspated by a cable = I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R, where I is the current and R is the resistance. There is little that can be done to lower the resistance, so in order to lose as little energy as possible in heating up the cable, the current needs to be kept as low as possible. This is done using a step up transformer which increases the voltage to many thousands of volts. Because power is voltage times current, a high voltage means a low current for a given power value.(Notice that transormers do not obey Ohm's law). At the other end of the distribution network, the voltage is stepped down using another transformer so that the voltage going into homes and factories is not excessively high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just checked the lessons and I have a couple of suggestions, tips, comments, and whatnot, well, a lot of them. I hope they to help you to improve the quality of this wikibook and your knowledge of the Spanish language. Here they are:

Introduction:

*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; &quot;requirement&quot; is misspelled. It has '''G''' instead of '''Q'''.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; (at least started: [[Pronouncing Spanish words]] --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]) Before the currently available lessons, I think the reader should receive an introduction of the Spanish phonetics and pronunciation (there's a lot to be explained here: the right pronunciation of the consonants G, H, J, L, LL, Q, R, RR, Ñ), as well as the Spanish alphabet and writing system, and of course, the use of the accent.
*After a few lessons there should be another lesson about the syllabic separation of the words, as it's very important for the correct spelling and pronunciation. Until this lesson, every polisyllabic word in Spanish that doesn't have accent should be written like &quot;'''es'''to está en espa'''ñol'''&quot; to let the reader know where to stress the word.
*After some more lessons, or as an appendix, there could be a section where the reader becomes a listener and hears the different accents of Spanish in the world: The Spanish, The Mexican, The Argentinian, etc.
*I notice that only lesson 1 has dialogs. Why? The other lessons should have dialogs too. Everybody loves them! Now, seriously, I think dialogs are at least as useful as all the grammatic descriptions, as they put everything in practice.
*A spanish translation of ALL the english text could be an interesting thing to do, but it might make the pages too overloaded.
*Also I see some mix of Spanish-styled Spanish and American-styled Spanish. This is noticeable in the use of the second person pronouns. I propose to define a standard, so the book looks more homogeneous. If I'm not wrong, here are three main Spanish styles: The Mexican-like (''tú'', ''ustedes''), the Argentinian-like (''vos'', ''ustedes''), and the Spanish-like (''tú'', ''vosotros''). I propose the Mexican-like one, as it's probably the most used (from the USA Latino communities to somewhere by Bolivia, I think). This is only for the dialogs and the examples. The verb conjugation for all styles should be described, even if that means a headache for the reader. An alternative  could be to include all the examples in the three styles, so European people can get used to the Spanish Spanish, and Argentinian don't feel despised.

Lesson 1:

*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; I'm not sure about the name ''Gonzales''. In Spanish there is freedom when it comes to names, and there's probably some people called ''Gonzales'', and I'm doubtful about the correctness of the word. I think a better word is ''González'', which is also the name of a place in México.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; I'm more sure about this one: The last name ''Pérez'' has accent in the first ''E''.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; I think it's a good idea to give also literal translations, so the reader knows what is he/she really saying. For example, the expression ''Encantado'' actually means ''(I'm) Charmed'', and ''Me llamo...'' means ''I'm called...''.
*In the personal pronouns section, you could add the pronoun ''vos''. It's for the 2 person singular, and it's used in 2 ways:
**the informal one: It's used a lot in Argentina, Chile, etc. I think it's used much more than ''tú'' or ''usted'' there. The conjugation is the same as with ''vosotros'' but removing the ''I'' before the last ''S'', and, if it has more than one syllable, add an accent to the last vowel. Example: &quot;Who are you&quot; -&gt; ''¿Quién sos vos?'' This pronoun is also used a lot here in Guatemala, but it's used only among boys, young men, and between them and their close relatives (a boy and his mother, etc.). It's almost never used by girls, or when a boy talks to a girl, unless she's his sister or if they're really, really close (grew together, etc.). I use it with my mother, father and sisters, but not with my grandparents. It's not used in Spain.
**The formal one: The conjugation is exactly the same as ''vosotros''. Example: &quot;Who are you?&quot; -&gt; ''¿Quién sois vos?'', with &quot;I&quot;. This one is never used in America, unless someone's doing a play of old, old times, and it probably sounds as old as &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; sound at least in American English. I don't know about its usage in Spain.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; Also in the personal pronouns section: You could explain about the difference between the article ''el'' and the pronoun ''él'', so readers don't confuse the two words.
*One more thing: ''ustedes'' is probably formal only in Spain. The pronouns ''vosotros(as)'' aren't used at all here in Guatemala, and very probably, in all of America.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; In the grammar section, the verb ''to be'' translates to '''3''' different verbs(!): &quot;''ser''&quot;, &quot;''estar''&quot;, &quot;''haber''&quot;. The last one is used where in English you say ''there is/are'', in Spanish you say &quot;''hay''&quot;. Example: ''There's a fly in my soup!'' -&gt; ''¡Hay una mosca en mi sopa!''.

Lesson 2:

*Gender of nouns: I think it's a good idea to explain that genders belong to the nouns, not to the objects. A common mistake is that people think that because a noun has a masculine article, the object denoted by the noun has some kind of masculine properties, which is false, of course. Then they don't get why both ''el camino'' and ''la vereda'' mean &quot;the way&quot; and have different articles.
*Also I see the word &quot;''caballo''&quot; in the examples, but the pronunciation guide is after the lessons in the index, and it doesn't mention that ''LL'' in Spanish sounds similar to the consonant ''Y'' in English. I've heard more than one people from the USA pronouncing ''llama'' (flame) as ''lah mah'' where it should be more like ''yah mah''.
*The definite article: please don't forget the article &quot;''lo''&quot;, which is used to &quot;convert&quot; adjectives into nouns.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; The indefinite article: the title has a wrong formating. It has 3 &quot;=&quot; before and 4 after it, so it can't be wikified.
*In the examples, ''Son unos boletos caros'': In the real world one usually omits the word ''unos'', however, it's fine as an example.
*Nationalities: The nationalities are both, adjectives and nouns. So in the examples, ''el hombre mexicano'' = ''el mexicano'', etc. However, when using a nationality as noun, you only mean people, not animals or objects. Also often when people say ''el hombre mexicano'' or any other nationality, they mean all the people of the country.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; Also, in Spanish the word ''americano'' means from the continent of America, not the USA. This is because in Spanish USA is abbreviated as ''Estados Unidos'' (United States), so the nationality is ''estadounidense'', and it applies to masculine and feminine nouns without changing: ''el hombre estadounidense'', ''la mujer estadounidense''.
Vocabulary-Colors: the adjective ''naranja'', ''gris'', ''marrón'', ''púrpura'', ''verde'' also don't change when describing a noun (''anaranjado'' and ''morado'' do). I think that it can be explained in the section &quot;Grammar III - Matching Adjectives&quot;. Also ''la naranja'' means &quot;the orange&quot; and ''la mora'' means &quot;the blackberry&quot;, so literally ''anaranjado'' = &quot;orange-like&quot; and ''morado'' = &quot;blackberry like&quot;.

Lesson 3:

*''¿Qué hacéis por la noche?'' sounds like a Spanish speaker. An American speaker would say: ''¿Qué hacen por la noche?'', or since he's talking about the future, ''¿Qué harán por la noche?'' for American, and ''¿Qué haréis por la noche?'' for Spanish.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; ''Mañana practico el tenis.'' - The article ''el'' is usually dropped in this case, just like in English.
*In the vocabulary, the article is missing in the English part, ''la noche'' means ''the night'', not just ''night'' alone. Same goes for next lessons.
*The verb ''hacer'' and the weather: the verb ''haber'' can be used the same way (''hace buen tiempo'' = ''hay buen tiempo''). The expression ''Hace fresco'' doesn't sound right. This is because the words ''tiempo'', ''frío'', ''calor'', ''sol'', ''viento'' are nouns, but ''fresco'' is an adjetive that means &quot;at a lower temperature than usual&quot;. It's also a noun in America (''el fresco'' or ''el refresco''), but then it means &quot;a cold drink&quot;. The phrases literally mean &quot;It's making...&quot; or ''It makes'' and are similar to when one says &quot;It's raining&quot; (nobody rains, or &quot;makes the wind&quot;, but it's only an expression).

Lesson 4:

*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; ''seguir'' also means &quot;to continue&quot;. ''volver'' also means &quot;to turn&quot;.

Lesson 5:

*''Tú eres de México.'' -&gt; ''Eres de México.'' It's unusual to mention the pronoun here, as ''eres'' implies ''tú''.
*''¿Eres tú de México? '' -&gt; ''¿Eres de México?'' It's even more unusual here.
*''¿Cómo...?'' = How...?; ''¿Qué...?' = What...? This explains ''¿Por qué...?'': For what (reason)...?
*''¿Cómo te llamas?'' can also mean &quot;How are you called?&quot;
*''Alberto estudia tanto como Felicitas.'' - ¿Felicitas? Now that's a really, really weird name!
*Superlatives: Spanish uses ''el X más Y'' for &quot;the most Y X&quot; and ''el X menos Y'' for &quot;the least Y X&quot;, not only ''más'' and ''menos''. ''más'' literally means &quot;more&quot;, and ''menos'' means &quot;less&quot;.
*''Plutón es el planeta menos grande del sistema solar'' literally means &quot;Pluto is the least big planet in the solar system&quot;.
*In Guatemala, ''el colegio'' and ''el instituto'' both mean &quot;school&quot; (primary or secondary). The difference is that mostly all the ''colegios'' are private and ''institutos'' are public, even though is possible nowadays to find ''institutos privados'', that is &quot;private schools&quot;.
*''la mar'' is often used in poems, but in a conversation, ''el mar'' is used.
*''pesado'' sounds like a localism. The international meaning of the word is ''heavy''.
*I don't know if the adjectives that describe persons with learning difficulties are constructive in this book (''estúpido'' [stupid], ''tonto'' [dumb]).

Lesson 6

*I think it will be necessary to remember here that even though the word ''me'' in Spanish is written just like &quot;me&quot; in English, and both mean the same, they sound very different.
*The tables of pronouns should have the pronouns in Spanish, at least to disambiguate the pronouns &quot;you&quot;.
*The example ''Te compro una bicicleta, te la compro.'' is, in particular, somewhat ambiguous. It can mean ''I buy you a bike, I buy it for you'' but it can also mean ''I buy it to/from you''.
*''el desayuno'' literally means &quot;to put an end to the fast (and start eating)&quot;. It comes from the noun ''el ayuno'', that means &quot;the fast&quot; (not to eat).
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; ''comer'' means internationally ''to eat''.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; Another word for &quot;banana&quot; is ''el banano''.
*It may be time to remember the correct pronunciation of the word ''zanahoria'' too.

Lesson 7

*There are a lot of words in Spanish that are very similar to their English counterparts. By including them in the vocabulary list, it will be easier to the reader to learn more words. So...
*There's another word for &quot;the closet&quot; and it is... ''el closet''! :)
*Another word for &quot;the refrigerator&quot; is ''el refrigerador''.
*''el plato'' also means &quot;the dish&quot;, so lavaplatos = ''lavar'' (to wash) + ''plato'' (dish).
*That's right, ''sartén'' is feminine. Some other tricky words are ''el agua'' (the water) and ''el arma'' (the weapon).

Lesson 8

*Here's the command conjugation for the formal (Spanish Spanish) ''vos'' pronoun, as well as for ''vosotros'' and ''vosotras'':
**''hablar: hablad''
**''comer: comed''
**''pedir: pedid''
**''dar: dad''
**''estar: estad''
**''ir: id''
**''saber: sabed''
**''ser: sed'' (not to be mistaken with ''sed'' (thirst))
*And for the informal (American Spanish) ''vos'' pronoun; it's similar to the Spanish Spanish form, but you drop the last &quot;D&quot; and put an accent in the last vocal. Remember that this is only for America:
**''hablar: hablá''
**''comer: comé''
**''pedir: pedí''
**''decir: decí''
**''hacer: hacé''
**ir: (Does not exist as far as I know, or is not used (What could it be?''í''?). The verb used is ''andar'' (to go, walk, to ride, to function [a machine]), and conjugates ''andá'')
**''poner: poné''
**''salir: salí''
**''ser: sé''
**''tener: tené''
**''venir: vení''
*Now some corrections:
**decir, negative: ''no digas''
**hacer, negative: ''no hagas''
**poner, negative: ''no pongas''
**salir, negative: ''no salgas''
**ser, negative: ''no seas''
**tener, negative: ''no tengas''
**venir, negative: ''no vengas''
*In the medical attention: &quot;the doctor&quot; = ''el doctor''.
*The end of the vocabulary can be:
**''el pie = the foot''
**''los pies = the feet''
**''el dedo = the finger''
**''los dedos = the fingers''
**''los dedos de los pies = the toes''
*so the reader makes the asociation :).

Lesson 9

*It's better if you include:
**''la radio'' = the radio station
**''el radio'' = the radio receiver/the radius (geometry, chemistry)

Wow OASO! Thanks a lot for the huge amount of suggestions - I guess it will take me a while to go through all this :), but once it is all included the Wikibook will definitely be of a much higher quality. Again, feel free and encouraged to make changes right away this is more efficient (but I am very glad for your writeup here since I'll be able to learn a lot from it). Thanks!

*''el desayuno'' literally means &quot;to put an end to the fast (and start eating)&quot;. It comes from the noun ''el ayuno'', that means &quot;the fast&quot; (not to eat).
:I though the english word breakfast had exaclty the same etymology, so to have breakfast would mean to break the fast. All the other comments are great, when I have some time i'll try to make the corrections listed here that are not yet done. [[User:200.89.153.204|200.89.153.204]] 6 July 2005 13:46 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronouncing Spanish based on the written word is much simpler than pronouncing English based on written English.  This is because, with few exceptions, each letter in the Spanish alphabet represents a single sound, and even when there are several possible sounds, simple rules tell us which is the correct one. In contrast, many letters and letter combinations in English represent multiple sounds (such as the ''ou'' and ''gh'' in words like ''cough'', ''rough'', ''through'', ''though'', ''plough'', etc.).  


==Letter-sound correspondences in Spanish==
The table below presents letter-sound correspondences in the order of the traditional Spanish alphabet.  (Refer to the article [[w:Writing system of Spanish|Writing system of Spanish]] in Wikipedia for details on the Spanish alphabet and alphabetization.)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Letter
! Name of&lt;br/&gt;the letter
! IPA
! Pronunciation of the letter (English approximation)
|-
|A a
|a
|{{IPA|a}}
|Like ''a'' in ''father''
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|B b
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|be, be larga, be alta
|{{IPA|b}}
|Like ''b'' in ''bad''.
|-
|{{IPA|&amp;beta;}}
|'''Between vowels''', the lips should not be fully closed when pronouncing the sound (somewhat similar to the ''v'' in ''value'', but much softer).
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|C c
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|ce
|{{IPA|&amp;theta;/s}}
|'''Before the vowels ''e'' and ''i''''', like ''th'' in ''thin'' (most of Spain) or like ''c'' in ''center'' (Parts of Andalucía, Canary Islands and Americas).
|-
|{{IPA|k}}
|'''Everywhere else'''; like ''c'' in ''coffee''
|-
|Ch ch
|che
|{{IPA|tʃ}}
|Like ''ch'' in ''church''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|D d
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|de
|{{IPA|d}}
|Does not have an exact English equivalent. Sounds similar to the ''d'' in ''day'', but instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, it should touch the teeth themselves.
|-
|{{IPA|ð}}
|Between vowels, the tongue should be lowered so as to not touch the teeth (somewhat similar to the ''th'' in ''the'').
|-
|E e
|e
|{{IPA|e}}
|Like ''e'' in ''ten'', and the ''ay'' in ''say''.
|-
|F f
|efe
|{{IPA|f}}
|Like ''f'' in ''four''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|G g
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|ge
|{{IPA|g}}
|Like ''g'' in ''get''.
|-
|{{IPA|ɰ}}
|Between vowels (where the second vowel is ''a'', ''o'' or ''u''), the tongue should not touch the soft palate (no similar sound in English, but it's somewhat like Arabic ''ghain'').
|-
|{{IPA|x}}
|'''Before the vowels ''e'' and ''i''''', like a Spanish ''j'' (see below).
|-
|H h
|hache
|{{IPA|}}
|'''Silent''', unless combined with ''c'' (see above). Hu- or hi- followed by another vowel at the start of the word stand for {{IPA|/w/}} (English ''w'') and {{IPA|/j/}} (English ''y''). Also used in foreign words like '''h&amp;aacute;mster''', where it is pronounced like a Spanish ''j'' (see below).
|-
|I i
|i
|{{IPA|i}}
|Like ''e'' in ''he''. Before other vowels, it approaches ''y'' in ''you''.
|-
|J j
|jota
|{{IPA|x}}
|Like the ''ch'' in ''loch'', although in many dialects it may sound like English ''h''.
|-
|K k
|ka
|{{IPA|k}}
|Like the ''k'' in ''ask''. Only used in words of foreign origin - Spanish prefers ''c'' and ''qu'' (see above and below, respectively).
|-
|L l
|ele
|{{IPA|l}}
|Does not have an exact English equivalent. It is similar to the English &quot;l&quot; in ''line'', but shorter, or &quot;clipped.&quot; Instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, it should touch the tip of the teeth themselves.
|-
|Ll ll
|doble ele, elle
|{{IPA|ʎ/ʝ}}
| Pronounced, mostly in Northern Spain, like ''gl'' in the Italian word ''gli''. Does not have an English equivalent, but it's somewhat similar to ''li'' in ''million''. In other parts of Spain and in Latin America, ''ll'' is commonly pronounced as {{IPA|/ʝ/}} (somewhat similar to English ''y'', but more vibrating). In Argentina and Uruguay it can be like ''sh'' in &quot;flash&quot; or like the ''s'' in the English &quot;vision&quot;.
|-
|M m
|eme
|{{IPA|m}}
|Like ''m'' in ''more''.
|-
|N n
|ene
|{{IPA|n}}
|Like ''n'' in ''no''. Before '''p''', '''b''', '''f''' and '''v''' (and in some regions '''m''') sounds as ''m'' in ''important''. For example '''un paso''' sounds '''umpaso'''. Before '''g''', '''j''', '''k''' sound (c, k , q), '''w''' and '''hu''' sounds like ''n'' in ''anchor'': un gato, un juego, un cubo, un kilo, un queso, un whisky, un hueso. Before '''y''' sound (''y'' or ''ll''), it sounds like ''ñ'', see below.
|-
|Ñ ñ
|eñe
|{{IPA|ɲ}}
|Like ''gn'' in the Italian word ''lasagna''. As it's always followed by a vowel, the most similar sound in English is {{IPA|/nj/}} (''ny'') + ''vowel'', as in ''canyon'', where the ''y'' is very short. For example, when pronouncing &quot;años&quot;, think of it as &quot;anyos&quot;, or an-yos. To practice, repeat the onomatopoeia of chewing: &quot;ñam, ñam, ñam&quot;.
|-
|O o
|o
|{{IPA|o}}
|Like ''o'' in ''more'', without the following ''r'' sound.
|-
|P p
|pe
|{{IPA|p}}
|Like ''p'' in ''port''.
|-
|Q q
|cu
|{{IPA|k}}
|Like ''q'' in ''quit''. As in English, it is always followed by a ''u'', but before ''e'' or ''i'', the ''u'' is silent (''l&amp;iacute;quido'' is pronounced {{IPA|/'li.ki.ðo/}}). The English {{IPA|/kw/}} sound is normally written ''cu'' in Spanish (''cuanto''), although ''qu'' can be used for this sound in front of ''a'' or ''o'' (''qu&amp;aacute;sar'', ''qu&amp;oacute;rum'').
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|R r
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|ere, erre
|{{IPA|ɾ}}
|This has two pronunciations, neither of which exist in English. The 'soft' pronunciation [ɾ] sounds like American relaxed pronunciation of ''tt'' in &quot;butter&quot;, and is written ''r'' (always written ''r'').
|-
|{{IPA|r}}
|The 'hard' pronunciation [r] is a multiply vibrating sound, similar to Scottish rolled r (generally written ''rr''). 'Hard' ''r'' is also the sound of [r] at the start of a word or after ''l'', ''n'' or ''s''.
|-
|S s
|ese
|{{IPA|s}}
|Like ''s'' in ''six''. In many places it's aspirated in final position, although in Andalusia it is not itself pronounced, but changes the sound of the preceding vowel. (See regional variations). In most parts of Spain, it's pronounced as a sound between [s] and [ʃ].
|-
|T t
|te
|{{IPA|t}}
|Does not have an exact English equivalent. Like to the ''t'' in ''ten'', but instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, it should touch the teeth themselves.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|U u
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|u
|{{IPA|w}}
|'''before another vowel''' (especially after ''c''), like ''w'' in ''twig''.
|-
|
|'''In the combinations ''gue'',''gui'' and ''qu'', it is silent unless it has a diaresis (''g&amp;uuml;e'', ''g&amp;uuml;i''), in which case it is as above: ''w'' (only in the combinations ''g&amp;uuml;e'' and ''g&amp;uuml;i'' and not in the combination ''q&amp;uuml;'').
|-
|{{IPA|u}}
|'''Everywhere else''', like ''oo'' in ''pool'', but shorter.
|-
|V v
|uve, ve, ve corta, ve baja
|{{IPA|b, &amp;beta;}}
|Identical to Spanish ''b'' (see above). The pronunciation &quot;v&quot; is regarded as an over-cultism{{Citation needed}}.
|-
|W w
|uve doble, doble ve, doble u
|{{IPA|b, &amp;beta;, w}}
|Used only in words of foreign origin (Spanish prefers ''u''). Pronunciation varies from word to word: ''watt'' is pronounced like ''bat'' or ''huat'', but ''kiwi'' is always pronounced like ''quihui''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|X x
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|equis
|{{IPA|ks}}
|Like ''ks'' (English ''x'') in ''extra''. In some cases it may be pronounced like ''gs'' or ''s''.
|-
|{{IPA|ʃ}}
|In words of Amerindian origin, like ''sh'' in ''she''.
|-
|{{IPA|x}}
|Note that ''x'' used to represent the sound of ''sh'', which then evolved into the sound now written with ''j''. A few words have retained the old spelling, but have modern pronunciation /x/. Most notably, ''M&amp;eacute;xico'' and its derivatives are pronounced like ''M&amp;eacute;jico''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|Y y
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|i griega, ye
|{{IPA|i}}
|It sounds as a vowel [i]: a. when it is a word itself (''y'' /i/, meaning &quot;and&quot; in English), b. at the end of a word like in ''rey'' /rei/ (&quot;king&quot;), c. in the middle of a compound word like in ''Solymar'' (''sol y mar'' /so.li'mar/, meaning &quot;sun and sea&quot;), d. at the beginning of a word followed by a consonant in words or names that have retained an old spelling (''Yfrán'' /i'fɾan/).
|-
|{{IPA|ʝ}}
|It sounds as a consonant [ʝ] in any other position: ''reyes'' /'re.ʝes/, ''yeso'' /'ʝe.so/. This standard pronunciation for ''y'' as a consonant does not have a perfect English equivalent, but it is somewhat similar to English ''y'' (just more vibrating). In Argentina and Uruguay ''y'' is pronounced similar to the English ''sh'' ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}) in ''she'', or {{IPA|/ʒ/}} (like  English ''s'' in ''vision'').
|-
|Z z
|zeta, ceda
|{{IPA|&amp;theta;, s}}
|Always the same sound as a soft ''c'' i.e. either {{IPA|/&amp;theta;/}} (most of Spain) or {{IPA|/s/}} (elsewhere). See ''c'' for details.
|}

==One letter, one sound==

Pronouncing Spanish based on the written word is much simpler than pronouncing English based on written English.  Each vowel represents only one sound. With some exceptions (such as ''w'' and ''x''), each consonant also represents one sound. Many consonants sound very similar to their English counterparts. 

As the table indicates, the pronunciation of some consonants (such as ''b'') does vary with the position of the consonant in the word, whether it is between vowels or not, etc.  This is entirely predictable, so it doesn't really represent a breaking of the &quot;one letter, one sound&quot; rule. 

The University of Iowa has a very visual and [http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eacadtech/phonetics/ detailed explanation] of the Spanish pronunciation.

Here is another page with links to the [http://www.spanishspanish.com/alfabeto_ipower.html audio files of the letters].

==Local pronunciation differences==

==Word stress==

In Spanish there are two levels of stress when pronouncing a syllable: stressed and unstressed. To illustrate: in the English word &quot;''thinking''&quot;, &quot;''think''&quot; is pronounced with stronger stress than &quot;''ing''&quot;. If both syllables are pronounced with the same stress, it sounds like &quot;''thin king''&quot;. 

With one category of exceptions (''-mente'' adverbs), all Spanish words have one stressed syllable.  If a word has an accent mark (´; explicit accent), the syllable with the accent mark is stressed and the other syllables are unstressed.  If a word has no accent mark (implicit accent), the stressed syllable is predictable by rule (see below).  If you don't put the stress on the correct syllable, the other person may have trouble understanding you.  For example: ''esta'', which has an implicit accent in the letter ''e'', means &quot;this (feminine)&quot;; and ''está'', which has an explicit accent in the letter ''a'', means &quot;is.&quot; ''Inglés'' means &quot;English,&quot; but ''ingles'' means &quot;groins.&quot; 

Adverbs ending in ''-mente'' are stressed in two places: on the syllable where the accent falls in the adjectival root and on the ''men'' of ''-mente''.  For example: ''estúpido'' → ''estúpida'''men'''te''.

The vowel of an unstressed syllable should be pronounced with its true value, as shown in the table above.  Don't reduce unstressed vowels to neutral schwa sounds, as occurs in English.

===Rules for pronouncing the implicit accent===

There are only the following rules for pronouncing the implicit accent. The stressed syllable is in bold letters:

*If a word ends with a vowel or with ''n'' or ''s '', the next-to-last syllable is stressed.&lt;br/&gt;'''Examples''':
**''cara'' ('''ca'''-ra) (face)
**''mano'' ('''ma'''-no) (hand)
**''amarillo'' (a-ma-'''ri'''-llo) (yellow)
**''hablan'' ('''ha'''-blan) (they speak)
**''martes'' ('''mar'''-tes) (Tuesday)

*If a word ends with a consonant other than ''n ''or ''s'', the last syllable is stressed.&lt;br/&gt;'''Examples''':
**''farol'' (fa-'''rol''') (street lamp)
**''azul'' (a-'''sul''') (blue)
**''español'' (es-pa-'''ñol''') (Spanish)
**''salvador'' (sal-va-'''dor''') (savior).

*A syllable usually contains exactly one vowel. If there are two adjacent vowels, they count as two distinct syllables if both are one of ''a'',''e'' and ''o''. If, however, at least one of them is ''i'' or ''u'', they count as only one syllable. If, according to the two rules above, that syllable is stressed, the first of the two vowels is stressed if it is one of ''a'', ''e'' and ''o'', while the second vowel is stressed if the first one is one of ''i'' and ''u''.&lt;br/&gt;'''Examples''':
**''correo'' (co-'''rre'''-o) (mail)
**''hacia'' ('''ha'''-cia) (in the direction of)
**''fui'' (fu-'''i''') (I was) (Note that this word has only one syllable.)

Any exception to these rules is marked by writing an acute accent (''máximo'', ''paréntesis'', ''útil'', ''acción''). In those exceptions, the stressed syllable is the one where the acute accent (called ''tilde'' in Spanish) appears.

==The diaeresis ( ¨ )==

In the clusters ''gue'' and ''gui'', the ''u'' is not pronounced; it serves simply to give the ''g'' a hard-''g'' sound, like in the English word ''gut'' (''gue'' → [ge]; ''gui'' → [gi]).

However, if the ''u'' has a the diaeresis mark (¨), it is pronounced like an English ''w'' (''güe'' → [gwe]; ''güi'' → [gwi]).  This mark is rather rare.

Examples:
*''pedigüeño'' = beggar
*''agüéis'' (2nd person plural, present subjunctive of the verb ''aguar''). Here, the diaeresis preserves the ''u'' (or [w]) sound in all the verb tenses of ''aguar''.
*''argüir'' (to deduce)
*''pingüino'' = penguin

== Relation with wiktionary ==

I'm thinking about the relations of this to [[w:Wiktionary|Wiktionary]]. A good bilingual would be a great language resource.  feel we can do more than make wiki textbooks.



I'm trying to focus a few ideas around that on [[meta:Wiki Language School]]. It would be something in a more dictionary / encyclopedia format - very browseable, but with focus on teachign rather than definitions. So the actual contents may actually look more like what's in a textbook.

Comments welcome - oh, and is there a page on wikibooks that talks about this kind of things ? [[User:Flammifer|Flammifer]] 19:20, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Language families unhelpful? ==

Anybody else feel that language categories for this bookshelf are unhelpful? I found them much easier to scan and find the language I was looking for before they were categorized into groups like ''ROMANCE'', ''Q-CELTIC'' or ''OTHER INDO-EUROPEAN''. If I would make one division, it would be between natural languages and constructed languages, but other than that the divisions make things harder to find. 

Think about our users here and what they would reasonably expect to see. Most people know less than half of those language families, so grouping would be an encumbrance to them.  --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 18:27, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:Agree. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:Agree. I also find the ''level'' of categorisation by &quot;family&quot; employed (i.e. how do you define family?) very arbitrary, e.g. &quot;Q-Celtic&quot; is not a language family, it is a subranch of a branch (Celtic) of a family (Indo-European): why choose to categorise at that particular level? Maybe someone will disagree with me there, but that is precisely my point: the decisions ''are'' debatable, hence (at least potentially) arbitrary, providing one more argument for getting rid of the categorisation. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

:Disagree. I accept anyone without specialist knowledge would perhaps not be familiar with all the family/branch etc. hierarchies, but I think a simple alphabetical list completely removes the possibility for people to learn about these distinctions and possibly lead them in directions which are intellectually stimulating. I read often in User talk pages about how people follow random link after random link and become interested in subjects they were previously unaware of. To take away the categorisation is to restrict access to knowledge, not increase it. I accept the division between Q-celtic and P-celtic could come across as an excessive concentration on differences that in world terms are relatively small, but I think the main point is this: To be simply looking at the languages bookshelf means you have some interest in languages and so it is only natural to find out the answers to curiosities that jump out at them. To name but a few: Why are Welsh and Irish in different &quot;branches&quot;? Why is Basque not in any group? Arbitary maybe, but none the less interesting to anyone with an interest in languages.

::To be clear, I only meant to argue for the removal of categorizations in the little &lt;nowiki&gt;{{bookshelf|Languages bookshelf}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; box up top. The family/branch grouping is a ''very'' good thing for the organization of the Languages Bookshelf page, but not for a small box. 

::It shows up on [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Languages_bookshelf|many pages]] and should be just a quick reference with organization that is easily understood by someone wishing to browse popular or developed language texts. I do not think it should be the job of a bookshelf to serve as a primer on etymology. Think of the user here and their likely expectations and search strategies. Alphabetical order is quick to recognize, but the family groupings make most languages harder to find (just try finding Arabic, Finnish or Irish without having to read through half the box first). As a bonus, we'd also free up another line so that more books could be featured. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 19:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm still not sure what the whole process leading to that is, but I'd like to thank whoever supported that decision, and also take the opportunity to invite anybody who's interested in such things to give their feedback on what they think of the (unfinished) course's design and content, since I think it's a bit innovative in the Wikibooks context. I'd be glad to discuss matters anybody might like to bring up, time permitting. Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 06:42, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

== A few things about the bookshelf ==

There are serious problems with the way languages are ordered/classified in the bookshelf - both in the smaller template at the top and in the main list. The points I will raise have already been touched on higher up on this page (but not resolved, I think, and certainly not satisfactorily in my opinion), and I think they do need attention.

I'll start with a practical point. In the template at the top, as it is presently organised, there is NO PLACE to put Miskito (or any other American Indian language): they simply haven't been alotted a place. Perhaps this is simply because until now there were no American Indian language courses considered worth including in the template, so it wasn't necessary to have a category. In principle, therefore, the problem could easily be solved by adding a new category.

That, however, leads to my second point, which is that the choice of currently existing categories is somewhat inconsistent because it mixes two different ways of classifying languages: by language family and by geographical area.

Most of the template goes by the former: thus we have various branches of Indo-European (taking up more than half of the entire list), followed by some other families (e.g. Finno-Ugric, Turkic) or sub-families (e.g. Semitic, Chinese). That's okay in principle, as long as we realise that the (sub)-families present do not cover all the world's languages and will therefore have to be repeatedly revised to make room for new additions not accommodated by the present categories. For example: (1) as I mentioned, there is presently no category for (any) American Indian languages; (2) if we wanted to incorporate, for example, Somali or Hausa, which belong to the Afro-Asiatic language family, we'd have to add Afro-Asiatic, but also remove the Semitic category since Semitic is also a branch or subfamily of Afro-Asiatic. (Actually, you could do it in at least two ways:
*List all of Arabic, Hausa, Hebrew and Somali under Afro-Asiatic.
*List Arabic and Hebrew under Semitic (as at present) and Hausa and Somali under &quot;Other Afro-Asiatic&quot; in imitation of the present category &quot;Other Indo-European&quot;.)
If we continue in this way, the more languages are incorporated the more complicated this is going to get, and we're going to need to revise (and discuss?) the classification over and over again.

However, near the end of the template (just before &quot;Constructed&quot; languages, which obviously should stand on their own as they now do), we now have the category &quot;East Asian/Polynesian&quot;, which has several things &quot;wrong&quot; with it in relation to the preceding categories namely:
*East Asian and Polynesian have nothing to do with each other, so why have they been lumped together?
*None of the languages listed is Polynesian anyway. (The Polynesian languages include Tongan, Samoan, Maori, Tahitian, Hawaiian..., none of which appear there.)
*Some languages listed (as a matter of fact, all of them except Japanese and Korean) are ''neither'' East Asian ''nor'' Polynesian.

All the above points could be &quot;fixed&quot; by simply correcting the categories without questioning the whole system of classification, but the next problem raises a whole new issue:

*As far as linguistic classifications go, &quot;East Asian&quot; is not a family at all, it is simply a geographical location. So if the classification is by families, you cannot suddenly say &quot;East Asian&quot; without disrupting the classification and making it internally inconsistent.

Before talking about how to solve this, let's take a glance at the main listing of all the language courses. (So far I've been talking about the shorter template that is seen at the top of the page and shows up elsewhere in Wikibooks.) 

The Contents box at the top of the page shows how this is structured at present, and it is immediately obvious that it is badly organised, the top-level divisions being:

*General topics
*Constructed
*Indo-European (over 60 books listed, classified into 4 branches plus &quot;Other Indo-European languages&quot;, listing 6 further branches covering 9 books)
*Sino-Tibetan (6 items: five Chinese &quot;dialects&quot; plus Nepal-Bhasa)
*Other languages (35 books, divided by language family - 16 top-level divisions plus &quot;Miscellaneous languages&quot;, containing three)
*Other language books

This is partly internally consistent, but not altogether (why should Sino-Tibetan have a different status from other non-Indo-European families?). I would also object to Constructed languages being placed ''before'' natural human languages rather than at the end of the list. Notice that this system does not mix geographical and &quot;genealogical&quot; categories. Potentially, it could be cleaned up, made more consistent, and mechanisms could be determined to open up new families and branches as needed to accommodate new books (I put Miskito in the Other languages/Miscellaneous languages sub-category simply because there was nowhere else to put it on the existing list).

But, I would ask, do we want to do that? Do we want the bookshelf to be ordered following a strict classification into families (and sub-families)? Is that useful for most users, and does it best serve the bookshelf's main purpose? These questions have already been raised on this page but I think they remain unresolved. Some people feel it is ''not'' a useful, practical system, and I tend to agree. One argument in its favour that has been given is that it encourages people to learn about the &quot;etymological&quot; (I quote; the word is used incorrectly here, but we understand the point) relationships between languages and facilitates random browsing. I myself feel there is much to be said in favour of the rejoinder that the principal function of this bookshelf is ''not'' to teach people about the relationships between languages - for that there are other sources; try reading Wikipedia, for example; and that as for random browsing, why not let people randomly browse through an alphabetical language list for that matter?

For many practical reasons, which I won't spell out further as I've already gone on for too long (I tend to do that, I apologise), I think there are two options either of which would be more useful to most Wikibooks readers than the present one, and which each have points in their favour (and against, obviously):

*a simple alphabetical listing by language
*a simple, broad geographical listing, e.g. by continent (and alphabetical within each major geographical category)

Perhaps the second of these (by continent) would be good for the smaller template and the first (alphabetical by language) for the main, complete list.

At least with either of these solutions I'd know where to put Miskito! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:56, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Thank-you! I've never been able to formulate this, but I've always had that nagging feeling that (well-meaning) attempts to classify languages into linguistic families are not going to help anybody trying to find a language book.  If you're just a guy trying to learn enough Korean for a business trip, you're probably not going to know that it is an Altaic (maybe) language or even care for that matter.  I'd say we go with the geographical listings.  Continental seems a little large, but anything smaller is probably going to be too arbitrary. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:33, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

=== Kowey jumps the gun ===

Hi Kowey. I would have liked an opportunity to discuss this here before going ahead and implementing your suggestion. (I was waiting to see if there was input from anyone else.) I suspect there will be practical problems with parts of the classification you've put there - cases where it is hard to decide which subdivision a language belongs to and hard to avoid arbitrary decisions on that. Remember that whatever makes it more difficult for a reader to guess which division to look in, or less probable that she will get it right the first time, goes against our present purpose. While I agree that in some cases it may be convenient to get slightly narrower than just continents, I wouldn't advocate going too far in that direction because it will create new problems, for sure. One other thing: I oppose any proposal to classify the languages according to official political units. Any division proposed by the UN is likely to reflect such units because the members of the UN are political entities (i.e. states). Sorry to be a spoilsport, but I think you jumped the gun a bit. Can we go back a step and discuss the matter properly first, and act afterwards? Cheers, --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:21, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi again, Sure! Despite appearances, I am actually in no particular hurry and was just laying down a concrete proposal.  Never sure how to navigate the mixed cultures of wikiboldness and consensus-based decision making.  For what it's worth, I personally agree that we should eschew the use of national/political boundaries as a basis of classifying languages (no need to see wikibooks descending into a mass of useless politico-linguistic flamewars).  I had simply assumed that the continents would be impractical as a basis for organising the shelf, and that broad, commonly accepted (?) geographical regions would be &quot;safe&quot;.  Note however, that we could always classify things in more than one place... perhaps an option to consider if things are looking too fine-grained. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:57, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

::Another thought.  If we went with a coarse-grained continental classification, we could use something very neutral as a sub classification, like 'African languages from A-M' -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:04, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

::Also, rereading your comment, I realise that you are saying that the adoption of UN-style region implies the acceptance of the political boundaries (i.e. nations within those boundaries).  Not sure what to do about that.  I went with the classification as I had expected it to be uncontroversial.  Oops.  :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:08, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

My 2 cents: when I am trying to find a language, I do use the language family tree. I feel it is the most efficient classifiation, since some languages are spoken accross continents. Also, If I am looking for a language and I do not know its familly, I simply use CTRL-F and find it by its name, no need for a near-impossible regional classification (I may not know the region anyway). So I am fine with the genealogical classification and don't need any other. I beleive any competent user of the internet should also be able to do a search on a web page and find what they need. If not, well what they need is a &quot;computer for dummies&quot; book, first, and then they can move on to learning a foreign language using web resources after that. [[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] 12:15, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, well, it's true that one could always search, but (i) that's asking just a tiny little bit more computer literacy than I think reasonable (very tiny bit) and (ii) part of the issue is not so much finding a particular book you are looking for -- admittedly that is what I had used as an example -- but even knowing that certain books exist.  In any case, I'm not suggesting that we do away with the linguistic genealogy altogether, just that it play a secondary role to a classification that is more obvious to the layperson.  In any case, let me stress that I have no strong feelings on the matter and would be happy to see what the community come up with -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:57, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King's proposal (expanded) ===

I share Kowey's attitude of &quot;no strong feelings on the matter and would be happy to see what the community come up with&quot;, as far as practicality is concerned, but as far as my own feelings there (even if not &quot;strong&quot;) are concerned, I tend to side with Kowey rather than Lgriot on the point that the latter has just raised, and for both of the reasons Kowey has given under (i) and (ii). Where my feelings might get a wee little bit stronger would be if the proposed solution were one that tended to exacerbate rather than correct what the Wikipedians call systemic bias, such as with a system that tended to favour European or Indo-European languages and marginalise African, American Indian (etc.) ones. And with that we come full circle, in a way, back to the original problem I had with the present system - which, by the way, Lgriot's comments do not address. I also agree that it would be great to have some more input from the community here; I hope we do. 

As far as specific proposals go, I fail to see what major problems there are with a &quot;flat&quot; (no sub-categories) classification such as the following:

*African
*American
*Asian
*Australian
*European
*Pacific
*Constructed
*Other books (not actual language courses)

Here they're given in alphabetical order except for Constructed and Other, for less bias, but another interesting (and practical) option would be to follow the analogy of the listing of languages on the Wikipedia project generic homepages, in descending order of representation: thus European would be placed first because there are more language books for European languages, and so on.

These categories refer to area of ORIGIN of languages; thus English is classified as European, not American (but Cherokee is American). I think there are very few languages for which it is at all debatable (and not easily resolvable) which of these areas they come from. I also think it does not take a great deal of linguistic sophistication from users to figure out where things are going to be. And Lgriot's argument about using Ctrl-F in the last resort is equally applicable here if there are doubts. The fact that there are only a few categories means that it's easier and quicker to browse through the whole lot and see what is there whether or not you know what you're looking for (i.e. in both cases in which Kowey envisages people browsing: to find something, or just to see what there is). Within each category alphabetical order would normally be followed, perhaps to be waived in certain cases such as placing different kinds of &quot;Chinese&quot; together, so you could perhaps have Mandarin Chinese under C, not M, for example.

In this list, I propose for American to include North, Central and South America, and Pacific refers to islands (not the coasts of America, Asia or whatever) whatever their size, from the biggest (Australia) to the smallest (Micronesia etc.), unless it is desired to treat Australia as a separate category, either way would do. &quot;Oceanic&quot; is not a good term for this because linguists recognise a certain group of languages as Oceanic languages which wouldn't coincide in range with what we mean here, hence I propose Pacific.

I do foresee a fairly small number of possible doubts here, but not enough or insurmountable enough to invalidate the proposal. Speaking of Pacific, I guess Japanese would be an exception because although it actually is the language of islands in the Pacific Ocean, we should follow tradition by classifying it as Asian (because that is where everybody will look for it). Secondly, languages of the Middle East might be awkward (is Hebrew to be classified as European, Asian or African?); here we might want to decide to add a Middle Eastern category which would, I guess, include Arabic, Aramaic, Assyrian, Hebrew, Sumerian and Ugaritic? I don't think Pidgins and Creoles are a problem because they pretty clearly pertain to the areas where they are spoken (not the place of origin of the lexifier language), so for example Tok Pisin would be Pacific, not European! Unless it is felt desirable to keep Pidgins and Creoles as a separate category of its own, which might be okay as long as it is clear enough which languages constitute Pidgins or Creoles for the purpose. Other issues? Romani and Yiddish are both European languages, I think that's clear enough, so no problem there...

I would be in favour of only using one classification on the bookshelf page, not providing more than one alternative classifications, as I think it's unnecessary (this is essentially an inventory, not a categorisation) and could only make things less clear. I would also recommend using that same, single classification system in the template and the full listing on the page, keeping them parallel to help users to find their way around. The difference is that the template would not contain all the titles; ideally, only those having reached a certain level of completion should probably be there.

Well, that's my contribution to the discussion for now. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 15:07, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King try 1 ===
This is what the implementation of my proposal would look like applied to the template part of the bookshelf page:


{{Languages bookshelf (proposal)}}



I have gone for the option of ordering the categories (European...) by size, so the more books there are in a category, the higher that category gets placed on the overall list. The content of the template needed updating anyway, so rather than copy the present content I have taken the information from the full list on the page, only including books that are claimed to be at least 25% completed. Needless to say I have done nothing to check out that information, and some of it may need revising, but that wasn't the purpose of the present exercise. At present this template is only in my private user space; I haven't touched the &quot;real&quot; template yet. What do you say? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:07, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:We could perhaps limit ourselves to the top N% completed books in each category.  This is what we do for programming languages, anyway -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:18, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Certainly. I just didn't want to be too restrictive, and besides, since this is an illustration of how the books can be classified, including more books for the exercise allowed me to give a more complete illustration. If this classification is adopted, I would recommend applying it in the full list too, so there's still more work to be done. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:40, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

::Featured books should also go in -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:02, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

I've been doing some checking and found a number of discrepancies between the (original) template list and the full list, such as: (1) books listed in the template and not in the full list, and (2) books listed in both but with a higher level of completion registered in the template than in the full list. Taking into consideration that information, and assuming that if two indications differ the more &quot;optimistic&quot; one is more recent information and therefore to be preferred, I have updated the first proposed template above to reflect the fuller information. At the same time, where necessary, I have revised the full book list on the present bookshelf page following the same assumptions, so that this information is not lost if we should decide to replace the old bookshelf template. I only hope that in doing so I haven't introduced new human errors; of course it is theoretically up to the editors of each book, I suppose, to take some interest in ensuring that &quot;their&quot; informtion is accurate and updating as necessary. In any case, all the information provided is still that given by editors (presumably of the books concerned), meaning that I still haven't checked into how true a picture this gives of the real situation of those books. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:42, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

: Dev markers on all our bookshelves are horribly out of date. Would there be enough 50%+ books if they are updated? Many new books are also added only to the templates, probably because the templates feature an &quot;edit&quot; link and are on pages like [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]]. All bookshelves should eventually be checked and updated. Great job with the proposals, have you considered sorting and updating the other bookshelves that you are knowledgeable about?. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:46, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King #3 ===
Kowey: I feel that three books per category makes little sense (sorry). Do you realise that would mean (according to my classification proposal) listing only three European languages? Hardly practical for many users, I think (since some of the most widely studied languages are European ones), and besides, how to choose which three to list?! On the other hand it would also be inappropriate, arbitrary and unhelpful, in my opinion, to apply such a principle to languages of other continents. Is it really a big problem to have a list of the length of the above template? Does it make sense to limit the list of language books if they really exist? (IF they exist! I repeat that so far we are taking the word of editors on that, which I think is the usual procedure here...) If you want to shorten it a little bit, though, one suggestion is that we limit it to one book per language (the most generic one, e.g. German but not German In Bit-Sized Lessons? the most completed one? some other formula?) --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:54, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

The one-book-per-language principle, if implemented, would look like this:

::To elaborate on this, I was thinking that we could have some principle, say &quot;must be &gt;= 50% or featured&quot; which decides which books get into the template, but bend the rules so that we have at least three (or whatever) books per category -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:45, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
:::That said, your third proposal looks very reasonable -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:47, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Okay, sorry, I guess it was me jumping the gun that time! ;-) Yes, I think the third proposal looks pretty good myself. And we could certainly incorporate your 3-minimum suggestion there too. I was thinking that some people (I might even be one of them) might think it a not-so-good idea to only list one book per language in the template if that means people are likely to go straight to that book and not even see other books (possibly even better ones for all we know) on the same language; that might be thought unfair, and I was wondering how to solve that problem (if it is one). And one idea I had for that is that when there is more than one book on any language, when the user clicks on the language's link, rather than being sent straight to one of the books, she gets sent to a disambiguation page (like the ones used on Wikipedia), with a list of the available books to choose from. That way nobody would be left out. What do you think? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 09:56, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King #4 ===

Here you are, I've implemented the minimum-3-languaged-per-category rule, by including Zulu for African and Sumerian for Middle Eastern. The only other candidate was Swahili, but it really is too unsubstantial to justify listing in the template.

Looking better all the time, isn't it? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 10:07, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:Yep! That looks very nice.  As for the languages with more than one book, we might consider having a small, for example, [[Wikibooks:German bookshelf]] which the German link would point to.  Perhaps a way to implement disambiguation pages. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:50, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Since we appear to have agreed on that (with the dissenting voice of Lgriot, which I respect, but I think it's fair to say there is a majority consensus - though it's a shame more people didn't get involved), I've now moved the list to the bookshelf and omitted it from here for reasons of space. I've read Junesun's comments and will respond to them below. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:45, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:How about the new template?  Are you waiting on that because you think it needs more discussion? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:48, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Yesterday I placed a request on [[Template talk:Languages bookshelf|the template's talk page]] with intructions for the change. There has not been any response yet. If we decide to implement my and Kowey's proposal for disambiguation pages/templates (for languages with multiple textbooks), the bookshelf template will subsequently need to be updated to reflect that; or if Junesun's alternative proposal of leaving multiple books in the bookshelf template itself is opted for, again that will entail modifications. In this respect, what I have requested (#4) can be considered as &quot;provisional&quot;, but I think it's a step in the right direction. Kowey's disambiguation strategy sounds good to me but it does require &quot;technical&quot; implementation (i.e. somebody still has to make those pages or templates). Kowey, could you yourself either: (1) create them and incorporate them, or (2) failing that, at least create ONE of them for me to see exactly what your proposal looks like, and I can try to do the others following that model if you prefer it that way?

:Hi, please see my response below -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:22, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Re: Language Shelf Reorganisation ==

I'm glad that finally things are moving. I found the old classification very correct (going as far as Q-Celtic and so on), but not usable by the average guy on the street. I believe a classification by continent is much preferable, though some people may look for Spanish under 'American'... By the way, I don't really see why we can't list all languages for which there are books that are at least 25% complete in the template, at least for the Languages Bookshelf page (and maybe limit them for the main page, though a lot of subjects have more books listed there). 

Unfortunately most of the language books can't actually be used as textbooks for any kind of study, even if they have received the &quot;Book of the Month&quot; award. I mean for example the main German textbook, which is why I started creating the &quot;Bite-sized&quot; method for German. I believe the main problem is a lot of good will paired with zero knowledge of pedagogics. The help page on how to create a good language-teaching Wikibook should be a must read for anybody wanting to create a new book in this shelf. Since that's not going to happen and since I now got a well-paying job creating multimedia lessons, I am no longer actively creating lessons here. I do believe that a wiki could be a good way of having people collaborate to create courses, but only under the condition that they get together at the start and then work as a team (single contributors work well too, as you show, Alan, but it's too frustrating) and that they first discuss the goals, methodology and lesson plan of their course. Otherwise there will be too many cooks in the kitchen and the result will be something like the Chinese Wikibook. I'm currently testing this concept (having a small team develop a course using a wiki) creating a basic English course for people in developing countries.

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 21:49, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:First of all, Junesun, I'd like to let you know that as far as I'm concerned, at least, your work and attempts to improve things here did ''not'' go unnoticed. I am a relative newcomer to these parts and it looks like all that happened before I got here. I sympathise with your efforts, agree with your evaluation of the situation, approve of your intentions, and can understand perfectly well your frustration too. I have hopes of continuing to work in the direction you have begun by (a) producing some quality materials that may be useful (at least to some of the more serious potential editors here) as models (the [[Miskito]] material represents a first, somewhat experimental step towards that), and (b) in the future, if I can manage it, also writing some instructional materials here teaching the whole process of language textbook production - material that might be of practical use both for future wikibook writers and for writers of such materials in any medium. That's a very ambitious project, and not all ambitions get fulfilled, so I won't shout too loudly about that yet, but I have thought about doing this. Support would be helpful regarding all that, and while I understand you may decide you have better things to do now (and perhaps you're right), if you change your mind or would like to at least discuss these plans, I hope you will do so - your contributions could be most valuable.

:Coming to your comments and suggestions on the bookshelf and template:

* ''some people may look for Spanish under 'American'...''

:I've inserted a note at the beginning of the &quot;American&quot; section to warn people.

* ''By the way, I don't really see why we can't list all languages for which there are books that are at least 25% complete in the template...''

:As in my 1st proposal? We could. I don't have strong feelings on the matter. Perhaps we should go on discussing that point.

* ''Unfortunately most of the language books can't actually be used as textbooks for any kind of study...''

:Yes, I noticed. In that sense, this whole list could be seen as a bit of a farse - the titles look very impressive, but when you start to look at the contents, most of it is very disappointing indeed. While that can be seen as a criticism of the list, it is a matter that exceeds the purpose of the present exercise as I understand it, which was to decide how to organise the list. Another matter for future discussion?

* ''I do believe that a wiki could be a good way of having people collaborate to create courses, but only under the condition that they get together at the start and then work as a team...''

:And, I would add, have the minimally necessary know-how to do so (which you said too). It comes down to a matter of education, doesn't it: education so that people understand what it takes to create a course, and education for those really interested in making the necessary effort to teach how to do the things that need to be done. I have also worked in this area in the &quot;real world&quot; - by producing language textbooks (including a small-scale collaborative effort which WAS a success); by teaching language teachers to teach (and working as a language teacher myself, of course); by working with teams producing language-teaching-related materials (e.g. learning objectives); and more recently, by working in a third-world country (El Salvador) in a project (designed by me) to support recovery of a dying indigenous language (Pipil or Nawat) in which a team was formed and worked together on the production of language-teaching materials. My experiences reinforce my belief that education is the first stop - people can't do things if they don't know how (or don't even know what they're supposed to be doing, never mind how). Some people aren't really interested in learning and will just plod along blindly for a while, and perhaps it's the best policy just to let them do that. The important thing is to help the other people who do want to improve and learn and produce good work. That good work, when it's done, will speak for itself, as results usually do. I find arguing with people enormously tiring, while working can be tiring at times too, but can be exhilarating too and is ultimately far more productive. Now, how to make that work in the Wikibook environment? Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:24, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

===Important ideas for improving the language books (EVERYBODY PLEASE READ!)===

:: Thank you for your reply. Working on Wikibooks is very frustrating and I believe this is actually part of the problem: somebody starts a Wikibook, gets frustrated with the lack of encouragement or participation by others, abandons it, then somebody else comes, adds something and leaves, a serious contributor may arrive long after the fact and add to the course or start to re-write lessons according to his ideas, leaving again... This explains some of the mess. That's why I believe it's essential to start with a team who have the same ideas and can see the project through together. Maybe it could also work if there's one initiator with a background in teaching who leaves clear instructions for people who want to join in later, but for [[BLL German|my German course]] that didn't work out.

:: The problem is even bigger than I initially thought because on the Wikibooks sites in other languages people often just translate existing courses from the English Wikibooks site, also translating all the poor pedagogy. This really is a pity, because the people there are really ambitious and work hard to do all those translations and then it's all for naught since nobody can use the books. I almost feel like putting big warning templates on every bad Wikibook so that people don't translate it or use it as exam preparation, but that would probably discredit the site entirely. Already language lovers advise each other not to come here to study...

:: Here are some ideas for a solution. I already suggested some of these at the Wikimania Conference 2006:
* suggesting to everybody signing up to Wikibooks or creating a page to read the help page on creating a good Wikibook; 
* heavily promoting a model language Wikibook or at least creating a language course template that includes sections like &quot;Dialogue&quot;, &quot;Vocabulary&quot;, &quot;Grammar&quot; and &quot;Exercises&quot; so that people won't leave them out;
* having somebody answer a short quiz on elementary pedagogy (drawing from that page) before giving him the privilege of starting a new book (he would still be able to edit existing ones);
* requiring the publication of a lesson plan for every course, so that new contributors will have a guideline;
* promoting a special page where people can look for other contributors to form a development team or post their ideas and lesson plans for new courses if they don't have the time to write them themselves. This would have to be advertised with a big link on the front page or on the page creation page, so that newbies actually find it;
* prominently displaying author names for every book in an effort to make authors feel it is &quot;their&quot; book that they should take care of rather than leaving it to an anonymous wiki community;
* displaying page views for every book in an effort to show authors that their work is being noticed and used even if nobody comments;
* providing a user-based rating system (0-5 stars) as an additional way to give quick feedback to the book authors and also so that potential translators and users quickly see if the book is any good;
* making it easier to upload audio files and add interactive exercises (template?)

:: As for improving the &quot;learning to teach&quot; resources, I believe the existing help page is already very good but goes unnoticed by those who would need it the most. I mentioned it on several Wikibook talk pages to try to draw attention to it. What would maybe work even better than that page would be a step-by-step guide towards creating a new language course and a lesson, mentioning all the things to consider at the right place. I would help create this, but only if it will be prominently mentioned at least on the language shelf template, so that it stands a chance of being seen by those who are about to create a new language Wikibook.

:: [[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 08:41, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

Excellent ideas, every single one of them. Attention, all editors! (The title at the top to draw everyone's attention was placed by me, not Junesun.) --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 12:02, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, I'm new here and just wanted to give some comments:
:* I'm very thankful that I may start a wikibook on learning a language even without having a clue or a plan about it! 
:* I don't think that guidelines for contributers are very important if there really is only one or two contributers at a time. I guess the active contributers can always rewrite the guidelines if they wish to.
:* The de-facto model language wikibook is the Miskitu wikibook. Maybe this should be emphasized in more places.
:* In my opinion, hoping for contributers is bascially futile. Authors should be prepared to write a first version of the whole book on their own. 
:* How to display contributing authors on the cover page of each book should be decided by the authors of each book. I don't think it makes sense for the categories to include authors as the categories are already cluttered with failed book projects.
:* Audio files should probably be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons; thus, I'm not sure what can be done about this within the WikiBooks project.
:* Displaying page views and a rating system are great suggestions.
:One question: I was looking for a place to discuss the design of exercises for the course I'm working on and finally put my thoughts on the discussion page of the Miskitu wikibook as A R King has written some interesting things about this. Is there a better place to discuss the design of wikibooks for language learning? Or is there just very limited interest in such discussions? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:03, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

== Back to the template ==

Resuming the discussion in progress above: (1) I understand that only certain people have permission to edit the template. So if and when we're ready to modify the template, who does that and how do we go about getting them to do it?

(2) Kowey, please see Junesun's question about whether we really want to only list one book per language in the template, or include all books that are over 25%, and tell me what you think because I'm pretty easy either way. Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:34, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Re (1): we could always post something on the discussion page of that template and maybe one of the Staff Lounge areas to get an administrator's attention.  As for (2), I'm afraid of having the template be too cluttered, but I suppose if we allowed for 25%s and used the disambiguation page method, it would be fine.  I tend to see the template as being our first foot forward, so whilst (a) we want to show that we cover a broad range of subjects (b) we also want to highlight the best of our work...  Although one thought is that the progress bars tend not to be updated frequently enough to be informative, so maybe we shouldn't rely too much on them anyway.  As usual, no real resistance to offer.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:22, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Re (2): Kowey, when you say &quot;but I suppose if we allowed for 25%s and used the disambiguation page method, it would be fine&quot;, are you just suggesting that we stick to my fourth proposal (the most recent one) for the template and do the disambiguation thing, i.e. 25%s but no multiple-books-per-language on the template? I guess so. What I think this means is that the link for (for example) &quot;German&quot; on the template will not lead directly to the book titled &quot;German&quot; (which would in a sense be overriding other German textbooks on the bookshelf which could, for all we know, be even better than that one, or at least different), but rather to some sort of disambiguation page where the German-related textbooks are all listed and the user chooses which one(s) to look at. Extra work, but it may work and would keep the template list less cluttered, as you say. Someone's going to have to created the necessary disambiguation pages and maintain them (as new books emerge, requiring new disambig pages or updating of existing ones), and I don't see much evidence of there being a large, busy, active community here to do those sorts of things (as one gets on Wikipedia); do you think we have the human resources for it? Otherwise, it sounds fine to me.

As for the progress &quot;bars&quot;, we do need some sort of index of progress for some such decisions, and I think it should be (and is?) the responsibility of people working on books to keep them updated, and in their interest to do so if they want their work to have the visibility it deserves. But if somebody wanted to look at individual books and evaluate whether they deserve to have a higher progress indication (and so, perhaps, get onto the template list), I guess that would be okay too; but again, who is going to do it? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:48, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Right, so I guess we're stuck with the progress bars, then.  Anyway, I guess I was advocating example #4 without remembering it.  Also, I suspect that creating the disambiguation pages requires a pretty small initial effort (I would make them bookshelves, like this one) will likely be maintained by the respective language book authors.  To avoid duplicating effort, we might use the transclusion mechanism to automatically merge the individual subbookshelves into this one.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:06, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

How's this? I've made some prototype subshelves for English and Chinese, with the links appropriately replaced.  Also, I have noticed that the template was only locked so that registered users (i.e. not anonymous) could edit it, and have thus replaced it with your proposal #4 (perhaps somebody heard our pleas and downgraded the locking, or there was a misunderstanding) (and thanks for your note) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:20, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

::It looks good to me, Kowey. If you would like to go ahead and fully implement the same idea throughout, you have my blessing.

== Language books quality ==

If I recall correctly, there was a wikibook: page that tried to suggest some best practices for writing language books; however, those practices seem to have the mix of good intentions + poor pedagogy that Junesun was talking about.  We might do well to hunt that page down and make it better! -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:22, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:For what it's worth, I don't think [[Help:How_To_Build_An_Excellent_Wikibook_Teaching_Any_Language]] was the culprit.  If memory serves me right, the book I had in mind was quite painful (sorry... I am pretty clueless about pedagogy myself, so what do I know?) and all the language books except for [[Miskito]] and some others seemed to follow it like a template -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:25, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Well, I've thought about this before, as apparently a number of us have, and it seems to me that if we can't actually stop people from writing books (or so-called &quot;books&quot;, in some cases) of dubious quality and usefulness, then that leaves us with the options of (1) creating other books, hoping that setting an example will eventually have some effect, or (2) offering advice, and hoping that it will at least sometimes be followed. I plan to try doing both at some point. It would be good if there were cooperation between some people on such projects. Such people would effectively self-select themselves (those who are not interested will probably remain uninterested) and my theory as that by being more active, our voice will eventually prevail. That seems to be, grosso modo, what happens on Wikipedia on the whole, don't you think.

Another thing I notice is that (predictably, I guess) there are plenty of moves to start new Wikibooks and much less work done to develop them. As Junesun says, most of the titles are actually pretty much useless as they stand. Not sure what can be done about that though, within the philosophy of Wikibooks. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:57, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:I'm writing a kind of &quot;wikibooklet&quot; for an audio course: [[Spanish by Choice]].

== Questionable links added ==

I see new links have been added to the bookshelf page, linking to [[LIL Esperanto 1]], [[LIL French 1]] and [[LIL German 1]]. After having a brief look at the target pages, I have my doubts about whether these are wikibooks at all, in which case as I understand it the links should not have been put here. But perhaps I'm mistaken; would someone else like to have a look and see what you think, please? Would the author of the pages and the new links like to explain here whether or not these are wikibooks? Thanks. No offence intended, but I think we need to be a bit coherent... --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 21:35, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

: I would hope that they are Wikibooks.  They are no different to other books on the site (except for being longer than two pages, perhaps).  Same GFDL license; same spirit of community authorship.  I sincerely hope that someone will one day be able to improve everything I have written.  I'm quite aware that if I simply write some lesson plans and wait for everyone to fill them in, I'll still be waiting twenty years from now.  After I have presented a completed text, the Wikibooks community can make any changes they please.

: You can download the &quot;mainstream&quot; French and German books as PDF files.  You will also be able to download my books directly from Wikibooks as PDF files as soon as I have finished making my own corrections to them.  (I made the assumption that it would not be acceptable to upload a 300-page rich-text file to Wikibook's servers.)

: My VR software doesn't understand PDF or Wikicode, but it is quite comfortable with rich-text.  That is why I want to finish making corrections to the text itself before I format the books as polished PDF documents.

:I hope that answers your question. --[[User:Lutonia|Lutonia]] 06:34, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::Hi Lutonia, I appreciate your commitment to the spirit of community authorship and the GFDL.  That said, the purpose of the wikibooks and wikimedia sites is also partly technical, in that it allows people to edit the same document immediately (impulsively!) without any overhead, i.e. downloading the RTF source, learning about version control software (for instance) or about diffing and patching.  So unless you are willing to translate your books to wikicode and have them be edited with the (admittedly less than ideal) wiki software, wikibooks is really not the appropriate place for your books.  I'm sure the staff lounge would be a fine place to advertise your project and to attract collaborators.  But creating links like [[LIL French 1]], which do little than point to a PDF is not wiki-appropriate.  Also, I would understand your reluctance to switch to wikicode if you were working with a typesetting language [[LaTeX]], but since you're dealing with RTF anyway, it seems that you won't be losing much by switching to wikicode.  How about getting somebody technical to help you make the conversion?  We can figure out how to a PDF out of it later; it has been done before many times over -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:14, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::Also, in case you were worried about convenience, there are tools which will let you edit the wikibooks content directly from a text editor.  There is a piece of software called MVS, which allows you to 'check out' pages from any mediawiki hosted site as if it were a CVS repository (if you're not sure what I'm going on about, it's no big deal).  These pages can then be edited in any editor, such as Emacs and 'committed'.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:17, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:::I am very keen to have the books converted into wikicode, and as soon as possible.  There are obvious benefits to a course which can be read online, a page at a time, and that contains clickablable hypertext.

:::However, I cannot make the conversion myself.  I cannot use a keyboard and my voice recognition software knows nothing about LaTeX or MVS.  I cannot use these editors.

== Where are the Baltic languages - Lithuanian, Latvian? ==

I've seen full text of [[Lithuanian]] in the requested books after I inserted Lithuanian. Why this very old indoeuropean language is not presented in common list?

[[User:78.62.22.250|78.62.22.250]] 09:28, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

::Inclusion of languages in the template (the &quot;common list&quot; as you call it) is no reflection of how &quot;important&quot; they are. It was agreed in recent discussion (see a little higher up on this page) to try to include languages that at least have the 25% progress bar. My own position is that all languages are important; this restriction is aimed at providing a manageable list and indicating to users the books that are likely to be most &quot;useful&quot; - simply because those books are minimally developed. Develop the books (or revise the progress bars if they are out of date - this should preferaby be done by books' authors, and taken on good faith) and the books can then be included in the template. I hope that answers your question. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 10:07, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

There's a new book on the above subject that I think is under 'languages' classification. Could someone figure out where to put it? [[User:Laleena|Laleena]] 11:48, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

== High quality Public Domain courses online with audio ==

Some organisation have created [http://www.fsi-language-courses.net/ a page with PDFs and MP3s] of courses from the US Foreign Service Institute.  This is high quality material (although it dates from the 60s and 70s).  I say this mostly because it's often extensive: lots and lots of MP3s and course books of 150 pages or more.  Languages include Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin,  Greek, French, Yoruba and more.  The organisation claims that they are public domain (which would make sense, these being govt produced).  We should definitely think about raiding these for our respective books.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:24, 26 October 2007 (UTC)

Is there a guideline or template for conversation examples in the language courses? I don't see many examples of conversations, but I have seen some here: [[Japanese/Mini-tutorial_lesson|Japanese Mini-tutorial lesson]]. I have also asked for some opinions on a few ideas I posted on the [[Talk:Japanese/Mini-tutorial_lesson|Talk Page of the Japanese Mini-tutorial lesson]].

==Language groupings==
Turkish is a European language but Azerbaijani (a dialect of Turkish) is an Asian language?
I know for political reasons Turkey is European, but it doesn't make sense linguistically.  (In that case Hungarian, Estonian and Finnish would be &quot;Asian&quot; too).  Maybe Azerbaijani should be European too, since Azerbaijan is partially in Europe.

:Or perhaps we should not divide languages by continent. Maybe doing so by language family (Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, etc) would be less ambiguous. [[User:Neoptolemus|'''Νεοπτόλεμος''']] ( [[User talk:Neoptolemus|talk]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Emailuser/Neoptolemus|email]] &amp;#124; [[Special:Contributions/Neoptolemus|contribs]] ) 04:12, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

::There has been a long discussion about this issue (see above) and the consensus was that a linguistically correct categorization is less useful for typical Wikibook readers, who are usually unaware of the linguistically correct language family they are looking for. Therefore, whenever there is a serious ambiguity, links should be added to point to the correct category. (I added links for Azerbaijani, Afrikaans and Hebrew from European; and for Yiddish from Middle Eastern.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 20:13, 4 December 2008 (UTC)

== Learning through songs ==

Learning through songs is valuable, so I thought I'd mention that some songs on Youtube have the lyrics in subtitles, e.g. the Indonesian pop song [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVxnyE8-7wU&amp;NR=1 Jadikan aku yang kedua]. 

On the one hand, I've read that it's harder to absorb information when it's in both spoken and written form (this was talking about Powerpoint presentations with text). On the other hand, it probably helps in language learning where the sound alone is not enough to pick up the words - and where the focus is less on the understanding the specific content, and more on making the connection between the sounds and the words. 

If we want to promote the use of this method, is it acceptable to link videos from the lesson pages? I'm guessing not, as they very likely will have copyright issues. If that is the case, I'll just add the idea to [[How to Learn a Language]].  --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] ([[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]]) 20:18, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:My experience with learning from songs is that you always run into copyright issues. Neither can you publish the lyrics nor a translation of the lyrics without a permission by the copyright holders. I'm not sure what can be done about this. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:09, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

== Church Latin ==

After reviewing the section for Latin, I feel that an entirely different section should be allowed to be created for Latin in the form that is in current use within the Catholic Church.  This is not to diminish the good work that has been done for the study of Republic Latin, but let us say the truth, it is not what is used or taught by Catholic clerics. This is not to say that people should not study the classics by any means, just to point out that someone wishing to study the form of Latin used in Vatican Documents, and in Catholic rituals would be better served by a different section with a different scope.  

It is still the same language to be sure, but there are lots of issues of Idiom and Vocabulary that would be very different.  Certainly you can understand what feelings of repression someone may feel if they are forced to learn Catholic Latin before they may move on to Caesar.  In the same way, many Catholics feels a sense of being misunderstood when we have to study Caesar first and read about pagan gods before we get to what we think is the good stuff, like the vulgate and the breviary.  

Also, the end goal is different.  In Classical studies, students are taught to decode the sentence (translate) and understand the final English result.  The focus is on translation, changing the Latin into English.  For some Catholics, that may be the case but many Catholics do not want to translate, they want to learn the various prayers, passages from the Bible, hymns, and Papal quoted in the original Latin and keep it in the Latin and understand it in the Latin.  

I would be more than happy to get to doing much of the work myself, and indeed it would not be that much work.  I am simply asking for you to allow the pages to be created and to be here and not to go behind taking out the &quot;j&quot;s or turning the &quot;u&quot;s back into &quot;v&quot;s.

:Hello there and welcome to the languages bookshelf! First of all: please sign your comments with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Even if you have no username, this will at least show the time when you wrote a comment. Second: Just go ahead and start a new wikibook. You'll find more information about how to start a new book here: [[Help:Starting_a_new_page_or_book]]. The most important issue is probably the name. Since &quot;Latin&quot; is already the title of the wikibook about Republic Latin, you should choose something different such as &quot;Church Latin&quot;. (It's more difficult to change the name of the book &quot;Latin&quot;, but I think you really shouldn't worry about that.) As you will see there are really not a lot of people working on language books right now. If someone takes out &quot;j&quot;s and turn &quot;u&quot;s to &quot;v&quot;s, just undo the changes and discuss the issue with the user. I'm sure everyone will understand and won't bother you again. And really: this is a very peaceful place. Welcome! :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:00, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

:::Great, I've added the book to the bookshelf. It is certainly OK if you want to proceed without a user name; however, I would recommend that you create a user account just to make it possible to attribute your contributions to a specific user. Imagine this scenario: you finish this book anonymously. One year later another user comes along and decides to rewrite the book in a totally inacceptable manner. If you then want to discuss these changes, you will have a ''much stronger'' position if you can be identified as the original author of the book. I think it is always ''in the interest of books and their readers'' that the main contributions can be attributed to specific users. In any case: Happy writing! --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:55, 25 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though Romanian spelling is very phonetic, a lot of foreigners find the language difficult. The accent and sounds are very similar to Italian (with slight Slavic influences), so remember to sound every letter clearly. Also, sounds very rarely differ between words (i.e. the letter '''s''' is always pronounced the same, everytime, unlike in English).

In the pronunciation guide, X-SAMPA will be used to help those people who are familiar with it, or the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), in pronouncing Romanian. For those unfamiliar with it, the IPA is a phonetic alphabet designed to help in the description of foreign sounds, and is used extensively by linguists. A good place to start learning the IPA is [http://www.ling.hf.ntnu.no/ipa/full/ here].

X-SAMPA is an ASCII method of transcribing the IPA. A guide to it can be found [http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/studerende/thorinn/xsamchart.gif here].

==Vowels==
; a (a) : like 'a' in &quot;father&quot;, X-SAMPA /a/.&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Open_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for ''a''}}
; e (e) : like 'a' in &quot;bait,&quot;, or 'e' in &quot;exit&quot; X-SAMPA /e/.&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Close-mid front unrounded vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for ''e''}}
; i (i) : in most cases, like the 'ee' in &quot;beet,&quot; X-SAMPA /i/. At the end of a word when following a consonant, however, it palatizes the preceeding consonant, X-SAMPA /_j/.&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Near-close near-front unrounded vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for ''i''}}
; o (o) : like 'o' in &quot;chlorine&quot;, X-SAMPA /o/.&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Close-mid back rounded vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for ''o''}}
; u (u) : like 'oo' in &quot;broom&quot;, X-SAMPA /u/.&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Close back rounded vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for ''u''}}
; &amp;#259; : like 'a' in &quot;about,&quot; X-SAMPA /@/ (schwa). &lt;br&gt;{{audio|Mid-central vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for &amp;#259;}}
; â (â) , î (î) : no English equivalent - it's best to hear it being spoken.  '''â''' and '''î''' are the same sound in Romanian. '''î''' is used at the beginning and end of words, '''â''' in all other cases. The best way to approximate this sound is to attempt to make the vowel in &quot;ski,&quot; then retract your tongue toward the center of your mouth.

Many states have developed '''curriculum standards''' for their public schools. These standards give an '''age-appropriate outline''' and '''structure''' that can be used to develop textbooks and supporting materials for all schoolgoing ages. 

The standards are in fact ''quite useful''. They are painstaking and exhaustive organizations of material with regard to the appropriate level of the curriculum. Teams of trained professionals have already done a big chunk of the work in developing high-quality textbooks. It falls to the contributors at Wikibooks to flesh out this work and deliver it in a way that will be useful and pertinent.

Note that standards neither dictate how the material should be ''presented'', nor how students should be ''treated'' based on their progress regarding established learning goals. Rather, the standards are an outline of essential concepts to be included, as well as a suggestion to how to structure them. Standards are often credited with improving educational attainment in schools.  Another way to look at standards is the state telling students, parents and teachers what not to teach.

==Why use standards?==
*In order to be '''used by a class in a real school''' the book must adhere to set standards 
*Standards compliance gives the books an '''authority''' equal to other textbooks
*Once we have one or two top-quality, standards-compliant books on the site, they will serve as a '''sales tool''' and bring '''attention''' and '''credibility''', which opens us up both to 
**more '''people using our books''' and therefore served by our labor
**more '''donations''' from institutional givers, which could translate to less site down time and new software features

==Standards in Australia==

This list gives an accessible resource for Australians who want to write textbooks for the Australian curriculum. These will vary by State, though certain things will be covered on a federal level. The standards are usually decided by the Department for Education and Training (in Victoria) and affect all primary school, secondary school, TAFE (technical and further education) and university students studying an accredited Australian course in an Australian educational institution (or an international institution offering Australian curriculum as part of its offering).

==Standards in New Zealand==
The [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz New Zealand Qualifications Authority] has produced a wide range (thousands) of modular &quot;unit&quot; standards that set out the learning objectives and assessment criteria for almost all topics taught in New Zealand schools and tertiary institutions.  Many of these are competency based standard at a topic level within a subject.  

Text book authors may find this approach useful for segmenting their books into pages or topics and pitching the topic to an appropriate audience.

Note: Level 1 standards are taught in Year 11 (14-16 year olds) while level 7 standards are at a tertiary institution graduate level.  (Qualifications are attained by achieving the required unit standards.)

==Standards in the United Kingdom==

The [http://www.nc.uk.net/index.html National Curriculum Online] from the [http://www.qca.org.uk/ Qualifications and Curriculum Authority] seems specific to England but also has links to sites that are specific to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

===Advanced Placement===
The Advanced Placement® program, run by the College Entrance Examination Board, allows high school students to receive college/university level credit in various subjects. Since these standards must reflect to some level both high-school level and university standards, they may be of some help in creating standards-based textbooks.

==Standards in Canada==
Curriculum standards in Canada are established for each province/territory in all K-12 subjects.  Each province/territory tends to suggest that their curriculum standards are high and this contribution to learning as significant.  There are some efforts to find common ground on standards between jurisdictions, but these are not maintained or communicated in such a way that allow portability or interoperability across various systems.  A Pan-Canadian Science Curriculum [http://www.cmec.ca/science/framework/] was created in 1990's, but is not utilized.

== Lernen 7-2 ~ Tour de France ==

(aus Wikipedia, der freien Enzyklopädie)&lt;br&gt;
Die ''Tour de France'' ist eines der berühmtesten und wichtigsten sportlichen Großereignisse überhaupt.  Seit 1903 wird die Tour alljährlich - mit Ausnahme der Zeit des Ersten und Zweiten Weltkriegs - drei Wochen lang im Juli ausgetragen und führt dabei in wechselnder Streckenführung quer durch Frankreich und das nahe Ausland. 

Eine Tour de France der Frauen (''grande boucle féminine'') mit deutlich kürzeren Etappen wird seit 1984 gefahren. Sie steht medial völlig im Schatten ihres männlichen Pendants.

====Definition Box====
In a few sections a box of definitions seems to be useful so there should probably be a universal style for the box
[[Template:PSG/def]] here's an example of the usage


  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PSG/def|&lt;/nowiki&gt;

  :War: Peace
  :Freedom: Slavery
  }}

[[Template:PSG/var]] here's an example of the usage


  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PSG/var|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
  :&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}\ &lt;/math&gt;: Force&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Cover Art Needed====
This book has ben cited a couple times as an exemplary book and yet we don't have any cover art. [[User:Msmithma|Msmithma]] 22:16, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

====TOC template====
The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PSG}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template should be placed at the bottom of pages

==Collaboration==

I wanted to get hold of Karl Wick but I couldn't find an email address - so I am going out on a limb here. I believe we can have a mutually beneficial collaboration. My name is Mark Horner and I started the Free High School
Science Texts project. The PR homepage is 
http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst 
and our project admin is done through 
http://savannah.gnu.org
. We are going to release our books under GFDL and we'd like to put them on the web. We have much content in Maths, Physics and Chemisty but we are looking for people to help us finish them off. We are past the 1/2 mark but still need help.

All my details are on the project page - please contact me if you are interested.

:This sounds like the beginning of a beautiful relationship. You should have recieved my email by now, lets chat on my [[User_talk:Karl_Wick|talk page]]. - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

What counts as nonessential?

:You ask a question that deserves an honest answer. To me, the &quot;essentials&quot; include everything that '''I''' needed to know to get a passing grade in a pre-med Physics class.

::Aha! You're revealing your biases! The reason for learning physics isn't to understand nature, but to get a passing grade!

:::True, there's the ultimate goal as well as the more immediate one. 

:Perhaps a more meaningful description of nonessential would be: extended detailed background. My goal in starting this study guide is to draw attention to the central concepts of introductory physics that are easily lost in the hundreds of pages of text in a typical textbook. 

:Often the biggest stumbling block or time-waster in learning a new topic is the terminology. In physics, add in the equations. This guide is intended to bring a spotlight on the equations and terms and give straitforward exlanatinons to each concept. Beyond this we can link to more in-depth material for further study. 

:--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Equations, equations, and equations, and not even a single overview or explanation of the concepts...

:Would that mean we should move towards adding overviews?  Explanations (if included) should be kept short.  This is, after all, a study guide, not a complete rehash of a Freshman-level Physics book.  Overviews should probably be kept down to maybe basic discourse about the use of such equations (after all, if this is a study guide, I wager it would be helpful to have an idea to help people with &quot;word problems&quot;...)

:And how deep into each level should we go?  Calculus based for everything?  Deep sub-topics into quantum equations, etc? -- [[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

::By just presenting equations with no explanation on what they mean, you're just encouraging rote memorization with no understanding...

:::I agree on that point, which is why I do think that SOME explanation is needed, but I do not believe that we need a textbook-like explanation (&quot;Free-fall acceleration is acceleration due to gravity.  Some examples of this acceleration can be seen when dropping objects from a height, such as an apple from your hand.  It does, however, have acceleration along the y-axis...&quot;) but rather a simple one (&quot;Free-fall acceleration is vertical acceleration thanks to the force of earth's gravity.  It is equal to ''g'', or 9.8 m/s^2&quot;) -- [[User:209.39.26.2|209.39.26.2]]

::I'm all into some brief explanations. My goal is to help students learn the material in the quickest and least painful way possible. 

::About the Calculus, let that be another book or special subpages of this one. I have not taken any calc-based physics and it is not necessary for pre-meds, so I want to keep that separate. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::I think it would be a good idea to include it, but I think a separate section would probably be a good idea as well (Kinda like how you've partially separated out the advanced work information).  An appendix perhaps?  (&quot;A Calculus-Based Approach&quot;?)

:::Also, I think I will rework the formulae in [[m:MediaWiki User's Guide: Editing mathematical formulae|TeX format]] --[[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

::I change my earlier stance and now favor including the calculus-based material. Tex stuff sounds great if you like, I have not familiarized myself with how to write that stuff yet. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::Yeah, I was about to say that I was going to add such to the Kinematics section first.  Now that you've said it's OK, I'll go right ahead and do that.  Shouldn't be that hard to do it inline.  Only thing is that the TeX outputs on a white background, so we will have to accommodate in terms of the tables. I'll go ahead and alter the Kinematics page first though to give you a taste.  I'll add some more explanation to it later.  Also, because I have a minor qualm with using d for displacement, favoring instead &amp;Delta;x (That's what I've read in every physics book that I've read), which also makes sense in the calculus-context (dx/dt), I'm going to switch those &quot;d&quot;s to &quot;&amp;Delta;x&quot;s. --[[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

::OK [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:::Take a look.  That's how I envision the pages looking (aside from adding a little explanation) -- [[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

::I like how the formatting looks under Tex. I'd like to keep everything as simple as possible. Right now I get a bit of a headache looking at all of the equations and for ME it is a bit overwhelming, and I think that it will be even more so for someone just getting into the subject. If possible I'd like to relegate all of the calc-based stuff to separate spots where it will not distract those who dont need it. One solution is for the reader to just ignore it but I'd rather not make him go thru all of that work. The calc stuff can be on a different page or on the same page further down. We could link to each more advanced page beneath the corresponding, simpler treatment. My whole goal in starting this book was to make the subject as approachable to a novice as possible and to eliminate averything that may distract him. My intent is that adding additional stuff is material for another, different book. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::OK, let me change my mind a bit again. I dont like the formatting in Tex so much cuz it loses the color that sets the equations apart, and the type is in a different font. I think yours and my goals may be different for the project. Mine include printing up copies of this material to sell on campus when I have all of the sections done. Maybe it would be better if you did a paralell version where you copied all of the material you wanted from here but didnt implement the pseudo-drastic changes you propose .. or do whatever you want to do on separate pages linked off of the existing pages. Talk to me cuz I know you will probably be mad/exasperated/something negative about what I am saying. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::The equations should still be fairly noticeable, as they are inscribed in boxes (you could dash them or do various other things instead of tinting the insides).  Feel free to change it back if you like, but I believe that it would be best to keep it as it is (since it would be more accurate to what people will see in their books, and calculus equations are more difficult to display accurately without the help of TeX).  It would be nice if TeX would place it on the colored background, but this, unfortunately, does not seem to be possible.  As for Calculus, it would be convenient if it were at the bottom of the same page, rather than on a different page.  I don't mind separating it however. -- [[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

::I also think it would be beneficial to arrange it as ''kinematics'', ''forces'', ''momentum'', ''work/energy'' (should be one section), ''circular motion'', ''fluids'', ''fields'', ''gravity'', ''waves/sound'' (should be one section), ''thermodynamics'', ''electromagnetism'', ''optics'', ''modern (quantum/atomic) physics'' as that is a more natural way to learn physics.  Each builds on the previous up to fields, and it is confusing to think about energy in the ''gravity'' chapter when it has not been mentioned in the study guide.  Everything after gravity is more or less up for grabs as to location, though modern physics should be last. -- [[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

::So where do we stand on forthcoming development of this text?  Would it seriously be better if I split off? (I also tested making the borders thicker on Kinematics, if it looks alright) -- [[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

There is some duplicated content in the [[Physics Exercises]] book I placed a wiki-link in the apedicies to that book as I figured that worked problems would be a good resource. --[[User:msmithma|Mart&amp;iacute;n S-M]]

After looking at the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] I realized the book needs a [[Physics Study Guide/Cover]] page and I made it and moved all the relavent information to that page from the table of contents.  Also I am in the process of removing all the Category:Physics links from the sub-pages. I also moved the detailed infoamtion on changes on the Author page to the disscussion page leaving only the names of authors on the [[Physics Study Guide/Authors]] page.  I created  the subcategory [[:Category:Physics Study Guide]]--[[User:msmithma|Mart&amp;iacute;n S-M]] Oct, 20, 2006

I am at a small college in Florida and as an assignment my students have created Wiki pages for Introductory Physics. Feel free to borrow freely from it [http://academics.eckerd.edu/facultywiki/index.php/PH241N-001:Main here]. -- S. Weppner

==Outlines==
Those box outlines are a bit too fat. I thought you had decided not to develop a different book but maybe we could just work on the same one together. If I want to publish my own version later I can just rework it to what I had originally in mind. Also notice that I restructured the list of topics as it seemed you had suggested, please modify as you see fit. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:Alright.  I slimmed those down to 3px instead of 4px.  If you want, I'll take them to 2px.  As for the topic list, I re-arranged it slightly to put it in a (seemingly) better order.  If you disagree, let me know. -- [[User:Pipian|Pipian]]

hi Dysprosia, I came a couple of times when it was set up, but not since then. Thought of cleaning the place a bit. The logo is gorgious imho ! that makes it a very sunny place. Cheers.

== Wikilivres ==

Je m´étonne que, en entête des Wikilivres, il n´apparaît pas la mention du type : &quot;Un article de la Wikipedia, l´encyclopédie libre&quot; comme il y a en anglais &quot;From Wikibooks,The freebook project&quot;.
N´aurait-il pas lieu d´y mettre cette mention? (normaliser le texte)[[User:Hibisco-da-Ilha|Hibisco-da-Ilha]] 09:25, 10 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Wikimania presentation ==

Ciao Anthere!  How're you?  We're working on the Wikimania proceeding - will you write a paper for your presentation?

(sorry if someone has asked you the same question already :p)

Cathy from Hong Kong  --[[User:Cma|Cma]] 12:25, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

errr, well. No. To be fair, it requires me a lot of time to write properly in english... and in this case, I would feel compelled to write in GOOD english :-) So, I prefer not. However, I can write you a better and more complete summary than the one I wrote much sooner than preparing the powerpoint. What is the deadline ? Anthere

Hoi :) Thanks for your reply. Yeah I understand that's a lot of work!  A summary will be good enough if you think that a full paper is taking too much toll upon you.  As you can see, there is not really a deadline, but hopefully it will be before the Wikimania 06?

--[[User:Cma|Cma]] 04:27, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

Actually, I am glad I did not make any summary... since they were all deleted :-) [[User:Anthere|Anthere]] 11:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

----

Anthere,

I strongly object to what has just happened with the the Wikimania content, and feel that your and Brion's actions are tantamount to completely ignoring the local Wikibooks user community, and a total disregard to local policies as well.  As far as where the discussion took place, yeah, it wasn't perhaps as prominent of a location, but keep in mind that even you should admit that Wikimania did not belong on Wikibooks.  It is only because of the insistance of people like you that it absolutely must belong on Wikibooks that it is here at all.

The only reason why Wikimania is going to remain on Wikibooks is strictly because of individuals like yourself exerting undo political influence on this project, and that strictly because of your position on the board.  Wikibooks is being treated like a backwater project that has no administrators, no user community, and no policies in place.

For a more detailed explaination as to why I think Wikimania absolutely does not belong, and by previously published policy is eligable for immediate deletion by an administrator and doesn't even need a community vote on the topic, see [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Wikimania proceedings, transwikiing, and related issues]].  This content violated several Wikibooks policies, and is from a certain point of view tantamount to vandalism.  I didn't immediately delete this content, and I did perform a full transwiki.  This is critically important, as I am not really trying to remove the content, but find a more permanent home, and through a process that has been accepted many times for many different projects, including multi-page content that is rather substantial.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:25, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:BTW, if you are seeking a formal discussion and vote, I guess we can have that now.  I have added this to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#Wikimania 2005 proceedings]], FYI.  I suspect several different opinions will be added, and you are welcome to voice your opinion there as well.  I'm getting a little hot under the collar for this, but I do think it eventually does need to go.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Merci! ==

Anthere,

Je suis bien content que vous ayez decidé d'utiliser notre livre à votre presentation internationale! J'aimerais vous y accompagner! I would love to hear more about the conference. I'm excited that our class project will be getting more attention. Starting next week I was planning to have class members contact physiology teachers at as many universities as possible to invite them to use the book and help improve it. While there are still some gaping holes and some misinformation, I am so impressed with what the students have accomplished in only 7 weeks. This has been a great experience for most of the students. 

I look forward to hearing more from you about your presentation. [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 22:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

THe presentation is in two days... and I am currently trying to prepare it (and not having much fabulous insight actually). See the link : http://www.hcuge.ch/genevahealthforum/index.html. In case you have a funny strip or interesting image to lighten up the presentation, I am more than interested. I'll use your book for the marketplace as well. Hopefully, it will bring some readers :-) [[User:Anthere|Anthere]]</text>

[[Systematic Phonics]]
----
If we can divide a word into syllables, it essentially divides it into easy, bite-size chunks that very easy to pronounce. In this way anyone can pronounce even very large and difficult words.

There are a few simple steps to divide a word into syllables.

#Mark the talking vowels
#Linkvowels with looping lines un   rneath
#Mark the consonants
#Identify consonant patterns
#Divide word into syllables

==Consonant patterns==
Take a word and grab any two talking vowels (the two vowels should not have any other talking vowels in-between them). These are the bookends, the beginning and the end of the part of the word that we are going to look at. 

There are just five possible combinations of vowels and consonants that can occur:

#'''VV
#'''VCV
#'''VCCV
#'''VCCCV
#'''VCCCCV

== VV ==
This vowel pattern is always broken between the two vowels. That is, one syllable ends at the end of the first vowel, and another syllable begins with the beginning of the second vowel.

==VCV==
This is the trickiest one of the five, the only one that will trip you up if you are not careful.

First, tentatively divide the syllables between the first vowel and the consonant. Then pronounce the result. If it sounds right, this is the correct division. If it does not sound right, try dividing the syllables between the consonant and the second vowel. 

How do you know how to pronounce the syllables ? If the syllable ends with a consonant, it is a short vowel. If it ends in a vowel, it is a long vowel. 

Think about it this way: imagine that an ending consonant has hands, and can use them to shut things like a Jack-in-the-box. If the box is shut by that ending consonant, the Jack-in-the-box is stuffed down in the box andd real short, just like the vowel will be short. If there is no consonant to shut the box, the Jack-in-the-box springs out and is real long, just like the vowel will be real long.

==VCCV==
Always break syllables between the two consonants. Almost always, even if the two consonants are the same one repeated, like a double &quot;s&quot;.  The only exception would be if the two consonants are a single diagraph such as &quot;th&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;.

==VCCCV==
Look for a [[Systematic Phonics/Blend|blend]] in the group of three consonants. Circle the blend. Then divide the syllables between the blend and the remaining consonant.

==VCCCCV==
The four consonants in the middle can be made up of either two double blends or one triple blend with another consonant. Identify and circle the blend(s) involved, and divide between them.

'''Blends''' or '''clusters''' are '''groups of consonants''' whose sounds '''blend''' together. 

They can be composed of '''two''' or '''three''' consonants and can '''begin''' or '''end''' a syllable.

Examples include br, cr, dr, fr, gr, pr, tr, bl, cl, fl, gl, pl, sl, sm, sn, sp, st, str, sw, sc, sk, scr, squ, spl, spr, thr, tw, rl, ng, nt, nk, lk, mp, lt, nd, and rt.

Systematic phonics is a toolbox designed to enable and empower a person to read. It is useful for children first learning to read, non-native speakers who are learning to read, and even the many native adult English speakers who have not yet learned to read.

With systematic phonics, a reader can break down any word, even the most difficult, into maneagable pieces called syllables. When a person can correctly divide a word, he can then pronounce each part and then the whole word.

Systematic phonics was developed decades ago by language experts as a way to decode the entire English language. 

:From a [http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/ch2-II.pdf paper] published by the [http://www.nih.gov National Insitute of Health]: '' &quot;Findings provided solid support for the conclusion that systematic phonics instruction makes a bigger contribution to children’s growth in reading than alternative programs providing unsystematic or no phonics instruction.&quot; ''

Extensive studies support that the method is effective. However, systematic phonics has not been adopted by most educators, who tend to use &quot;whole language&quot; or &quot;holistic learning&quot; to teach kids to read. Proponents of systematic phonics claim that the failure of many students to read to level can be traced to the use of other, less systematic, teaching methods.

Systematic phonics an be an important part of learning [[English as a Second Language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A great way to learn to do design is to stretch your graphic design muscles. That is, push up your shirtsleeves and get down to doing some projects. Don't worry if the stuff turns out bad or people hate it, it's all a process of learning.

==Business card design==
Every professional needs a business card. The US standard is 2&quot; x 3.5&quot; (89 mm x 51 mm). Use a .125&quot; (3.175 mm) margin on all sides.

Using a desktop publishing program, such as [[Scribus]], make a business card for yourself, with typography and graphic elements. Plan layout with an eye for hierarchy.

==Symbol design==
Using Adobe Illustrator or a similar vector-graphics tool, design a stylized icon or symbol representing an animal, taking care to communicate the socially perceived emotional connotations of this animal. The icon should be scalable to the point that it can be used on office stationary as well as blown up to billboard size. The symbol should employ limited colors so as to be easily and inexpensively printable.

==Compact disc design==
Find an existing or imagined compact disc recording and design a complete package for it, including all copy appropriate for a disc to be sold in a store (song list, copyright information, etc.) You may use photography that you take yourself or any drawings or other computer art, etc. that you create yourself or commission for the project. Design the inside and outside of the CD case as well as the disc itself, keeping yourself open to the possibilites of non-traditional CD cases (transparent, etc.)

==Typeface design==
Design a complete alphabet with special characters of your own, original font. You may choose a serif or sans-serif font, or a decorative font. Give samples of bold, extra bold, and italic versions of some letters. 

==Webpage design==

Design, using appropriate tools, an entire webpage devoted to a social or political cause of your choosing. Use colors, images, and a style that conforms to the page's message. Importantly don't forget - that the page you are designing for the Visitors only. So first classify your visitors, and use the color schemes which they impress most. And try to design a user friendly navigation system with a low flashy images.

==Toy design==
Design a novel toy, optimized for maximum &quot;fun-ness&quot; for an audience of your choosing, and its complete packaging. Include suggestions for a marketing campaign promoting the toy.

==Personal projects==
Design a project that personally touches you. Whether it be a collage or a poster for something you believe in, it is important to perform your skills for your own use as well as for your clients. Combine tools (Adobe with Macromedia with ink, pencil, highlighters and your trusty scanner). Have fun.

----
It is difficult to discuss the subject of biochemistry without a firm foundation in general chemistry and organic chemistry, but if one doesn't remember the concept of the Acid Dissociation Constant (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) from Organic Chemistry, one can read up on the topic below.


''Buffers'' are essential to biochemical reactions, as they provide a (more or less) stable pH value for reactions to take place under constantly changing circumstances. The pH value in living cells tends to fall between 7.2 and 7.4, and this pH level is generally maintained by weak acids. (The pH values in lysosomes and peroxisomes differ from this value, as do the pH measurements of the stomach and other organs found in various types of plants and animals.)


An ''acid'' is here defined simply as any molecule that can release a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into a solution. Stronger acids are more likely to release a proton, due to their atomic and molecular properties. The tendency of an acid to release a proton is called the ''dissociation constant'' (''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) of that substance, with
:&lt;math&gt;{K}_{a} = {[{H}^{+}][{A}^{-}] \over [HA]}&lt;/math&gt;
for HA &lt;-&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.


A larger ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value means a greater tendency to dissociate a proton, and thus it means the substance is a stronger acid. The pH at which 50% of the protons are dissociated can therefore be calculated as:
:p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -log ( ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; )
This equation is known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

:&lt;math&gt;{pH} = {pK}_{a} + log{[base] \over [acid]}&lt;/math&gt;

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is derived from the adjacent K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; expression. By taking the logarithm of base ten to both sides, the next part of the equation is obtained. Using the logarithmic property of multiplication, the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] breaks from the expression. Since log K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to -pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and log [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is equal to -pH, they are then substituted. To obtain what is known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, -pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and -pH are subtracted from their respective sides to yield a positive equation. 



The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation interestingly enough predicts the behavior of buffer solutions.  A solution of 1 M ethanoic (acetic) acid [HA] and 1 M sodium ethanoate [A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] will have a pH equal to the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of ethanoic acid: 4.76.  


If we added acid to pure water up to a concentration of 0.1 M, the pH would become 1. If we add the same concentration of acid to the buffer solution, it will react with the ethanoate to form ethanoic acid. The ethanoate concentration would drop to 0.9 M and the ethanoic acid concentration should rise to 1.1 M. The pH becomes 4.67 - very different from the pH=1 ''without'' a buffer.


Similarly, adding 0.1 M alkali changes the pH of the buffer to 4.85, instead of pH=13 without buffer.  Due to the amphipathic nature of amino acids - which are the monomer building blocks of all proteins, physiological conditions are always considered to be buffered, which plays a major role in the conformations and reactivities of substrates in the cell's liquid interior, its cytosol.


A very small (which would include a large negative value) p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; indicates a very strong acid.  A p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value between 4 and 5 is the most common range for organic acid compounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Drawing=
It's a good idea for a student of graphic design to learn how to draw. Sure, you can bypass this and do everything by computer, but drawing by hand trains your mind and your eye to seek out details and improve your grasp of visual forms. It develops different parts of your mind that relate to composition, color, anatomy, depth and mood, and helps you directly perceive things and interpret them. 

Much of what we relate to in our lives is linear. For effective visual communication you need to develop a nonlinear, direct connection to the actual tensions, feelings, and dimesions you are interpreting and expressing in your work. Drawing can be an invaluable way to develop a direct connection to the world around you and develop your own outlook.

The ultimate aim of the graphic designer is to understand, use and coordinate the tools of the craft (typeface, art, photography, printing, etc.) and create a message that rises above them. As in music, you do not pay attention to the instruments alone but to the composition as a whole.

Draw some architecture, some life studies, and some abstract compositions. Start with basic media like pencil and charcoal, and then try some things in color. Look at master drawings for ideas and inspiration. 

In interpreting three dimensions on a flat surface with a defined page shape, you encounter a number of issues. Evaluate how light falls across an object and how you can make shapes out of shadows. Shading, the gradation of darkness, is one of the most important factors when you draw an object. Shading and defining basic forms can provide a truer understanding of a dimensional object on a flat surface, and can make the difference between a really shoddy piece and a proper drawing. Get beyond outlining in your definition of form.

Appreciate your overall use of the page. Be familiar with positive and negative space (negative space is that space that falls between the objects) and understand they are all part of the overall composition.

To be successful at graphic design you need to develop a taste for solving visual problems and a set of strategies for resolving them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Typography=

Typeforms are an integral part of modern communication. Since the invention of the printing press, people have used printed —and more recently— electronic type to communicate. Could you imagine a newspaper or magazine where all the articles were handwritten and copied? Imagine how difficult it would be to compose an e-mail or use desktop publishing software to create party invitations without the existence of typefaces. 

Typefaces are used in print and electronic media not just to communicate a legible message, but as an expressive tool of the author or designer. Each typeface can be used to convey a different style or atmosphere. There are typefaces evocative of Art Deco, The old American West, Weddings and other traditionally formal ceremonies, childhood, The Middle Ages, handwritten text, and an endless variety of other styles.

It is almost imperative as a graphic designer, and ''absolutely'' imperative as a typographer, to develop an appreciation and understanding of both modern and historic [[typography]]. In everyday life, one should pay attention to the stylistic and practical uses of typefaces in various kinds of media. Note what feelings the designer was hoping to convey, or what style they were attempting to mimic.

==Classification==

A '''typeface''' is a style of lettering, such as Helvetica or Times. A '''font''' is the set of a typeface, used to produce the letters. On a computer, it is a file used by the system.  People often confuse &quot;font&quot; with &quot;typeface&quot;.  For example, Helvetica, point 12 is a different font from Helvetica, point 14, even though both are of the same typeface.  

A set of similar typefaces is called a &quot;family.&quot; Within a family, typefaces are categorized as parent (e.g. Times, Helvetica) or relative (e.g. bold, italic). Typefaces are categorized also according to style (e.g. italic, book), weight (e.g. bold or light), and width (e.g. expanded).  

Type is measured in points, from top to bottom of the letters' invisible bounding boxes. Since each letter fills up a percentage of that bounding box, when the size of the box is increased, the letter size increases.

The divisions you may already be familiar with are the '''serif''' and &lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt; '''sans-serif'''&lt;/font&gt; fonts. Serif fonts, like Times, have the little feet and variable line width characters which make them easy to read. Sans-serif fonts, like Helvetica and Verdana, are drawn with more even-width lines and don't have the little feet, which gives them a clean, modern feel.

==Usage in Design==

Text can have a number of different purposes in a design. It can be used for pure graphic appeal —or aesthetically— a case in which legibility may be less important than aesthetics. An example of graphical use of text is possibly that of major titles.  Text may also, more commonly, be used for communication on a linguistic basis rather than visual, in which case, legibility is always the priority of the designer. A few examples of usage of text for linguistic communication are: the body text of an article or book, the text of a restaurant menu, or in product descriptions in a catalog.

A font may be used either successfully or poorly, depending on its degree of relevance in the project and the skill of the designer. The designer must pay careful attention to letter, word, and line spacing as well as the size of the typeface and its stylistic contribution to the overall aesthetic of the project.  He or she must optimize the properties of the text for its purpose in the overall design (aesthetic or communicative) and maintain legibility where it is necessary, and the designer is also expected to add visual variety with formatting and layout, as well as possible font changes where applicable.

=== Choosing a Font ===

A designer has to choose a font that is not only appropriate to the mood of the design, but that is appropriate for the text's purpose in the design.
For example, there are many kinds of decorative typefaces that one would not want to set an entire article in. This is because a purely decorative typeface tends to be distracting to the content of the message and tire the reader's eyes when used in large portions. Our eyes are most comfortable reading less idiosyncratic typefaces. Decorative typefaces are better suited for display type (greater than 14 points), while simpler type is better used for text (less than 14 points). To maintain readability in large blocks of text —such as in an article— stay consistent, and use only one family.

==== Readability in Different Media ====

Standard graphic design wisdom holds that of the categories of serif and sans-serif, serif fonts are easier to read. This is because when reading, the eye quickly scans the tops of the letterforms, and a serif font has more immediately recognizable features thanks to the tiny 'eye-holds' provided by the serifs. There is a notion slowly gaining acceptance, that, for the purposes of purely electronic design, the reverse is sometimes true. Sans-serif fonts are more readable in this case because a screen has a lower resolution than a printed page, so the serifs only serve to smudge the letter forms.

Some typefaces such as Times, originally designed for the London Times newspaper, or Futura, designed as a letterpress (raised plate) type for printing on paper, were intended for the printed page. Others such as Georgia and Verdana were designed for the lower resolution of text on a screen. The shapes of these typefaces are developed to optimize visibility in smaller sizes on a computer monitor. In larger sizes, these differences don't matter as much. 

''For maximum readability on the page: Serif; On the screen: Sans.''

=== Typeface Sizing ===

Keep the typeface at a reasonable size for reading. The numbered size of a typeface may reflect the overall height of the lines that stick out of the type, but not the readability size that relates to the inner dimensions of the letters. The type size should be chosen on a visual basis, and not purely on that of font size numbers. Usually, type that is proportioned so that the lower case size is larger in proportion to the overall height of the font, can produce a greater amount of legible words into an equivalent space.

=== Typeface Spacing ===

Word spacing should be so that the reader is aware of the beginnings and endings of words with little or no difficulty. Experiment with spacing settings to find the best one. Letter spacing and line spacing may be used to expand on the expressivity of the font. Leave enough space between the lines so that the text is legible. Experimentation is important here, too. The reader's eyes should be pulled to the next word as they read, not to the lines above and below. The letter spacing should be that so the reader can easily differentiate between different characters. Yet again: experiment, experiment, experiment.

; Kerning
: Kerning is the horizontal spacing between exactly 2 [[w:glyph|glyph]]s. When you are hand kerning text (logotype or headline text usually) try to imagine that the [[w:baseline|baseline]] and glyph shapes make a container, and imagine pouring water in. Try to make the [[w:negative space|negative space]] between each pair of glyphs hold the same amount of water.
; Tracking 
: Tracking is the horizontal space added to or subtracted from the space between each and every pair of glyphs in a selection. In other words tracking adds to or subtracts from the kerning of all pairs of glyphs in a selection.
; Leading
: Leading is the vertical spacing between separate lines of type. There is a relationship between the length of the line and the amount of leading needed for easy legibility. Longer lines need more leading to prevent the reader's eye from slipping up or down when moving from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. It then logically follows that short lines are preferable if information density is important as in a newspaper.
; Typographic Color
: Typographic Color is something of a misnomer in that it is only concerned with one aspect of color: value. The darkness or lightness of a block of text on average is the typographic color of that block of text. Typographic color is strongly influenced by spacing. Consider the difference in the emotions aroused by a dark block of text (long lines with little tracking and leading as seen in many legal agreements) and a light block of text with lots of space. 

=== When to Break Rules ===

With text used purely for graphical or display purposes, spacing, fonts, or colors that would be considered otherwise unreasonable can be utilized to create a visually appealing effect. The legibility rules that are extremely important in body text aren't as critical to effect the larger typeface size. Make sure that before deciding to use more untraditional methods of formatting text, you consider the desires of your client, and/or the stylistic effect the formatting will have on the overall design. Is it supposed to be a classic, elegant wedding invitation, or is this a layout for a skateboarding magazine article? Consider the circumstances and break or follow the rules of tradition appropriately. Remember that a common amateur mistake is to break too many —or the wrong— formatting rules in rebellion of the idea that aesthetics have constraints. Then, they end up with a horrible mess of a design that looks good under no circumstances. ''The purpose of a graphic designer is to merge optimal form and function''. Remember: anything can be art, but not anything can look good!

==Layout==

A good layout is one that shows good use of the elements and principles of design. Most importantly, a designer should use the principles of design to draw the reader's eye both to and through the design easily. The elements of design are: color, value, texture, shape, form, space, and line. The principles of design are: contrast, emphasis, balance, unity, pattern, movement, and rhythm. The specifics of both the principles and elements vary from source to source, but the idea remains the same. If you haven't studied the principles and elements of design before, read more in the chapter [[Graphic Design/Principles of Design|Principles of Design]], or scroll down to view the external links.

=Form and function=
Just like in architecture, one of the fundamental debates in graphic design is between form and function.

'''Form''' is defined as the shape or visual quality of something. It refers to aesthetics, how a piece looks. Much of graphic design centers on how to make a work appealing (or unappealing, or any other quality depending on the project goals). 

'''Function''' relates to getting the job done. Function is pragmatic and business-oriented. Printing newspaper on glossy magazine paper is too expensive, and printing it on tissue paper would fall apart. An artistic photograph of a mountain may not convey a message appropriate to an Arctic cruise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book was started by [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]], a graduate of the acclaimed [http://www.uc.edu/ University of Cincinnati] College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning ([http://www.daap.uc.edu/ DAAP]).

==Note from the author==
There are not many textbooks published on the discipline of graphic design. Perhaps this is due in part to the abstract, subjective nature of many of its aspects, and the fact that there are few universally-agreed-upon rules like there are for mathematics or the hard sciences. 

This book is an attempt to formalize some of the concepts that were taught to me while in design school. The material was difficult and sometimes even overwhelming for me at the time. I did not graduate at the top of my class. However DAAP is a widely respected school and I did receive the vigorous training that characterizes its graphic design department. In this book I will try to break down in a simple and understandable way the basics of what I learned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Congruency==
''Congruent'' shapes are the same size with corresponding lengths and angles equal. In other words, they are exactly the same size and shape. They will fit on top of each other perfectly. Therefore if you know the size and shape of one you know the size and shape of the others. For example:

[[Image:CongruentTriangles.png|(Three congruent triangles)]]

Each of the above shapes is congruent to each other. The only difference is in their orientation, or the way they are rotated. If you traced them onto paper and cut them out, you could see that they fit over each other exactly.

[[Image:Congruent2.png|(Two similar but non-congruent triangles, redrawn to show them the same orientation)]]

Having done this, right away we can see that, though the angles correspond in size and position, the sides do not. Therefore it is proved the triangles are '''not''' congruent.

==Similarity==
''Similar'' shapes are like congruent shapes in that they must be the same shape, but they don't have to be the same size. Their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are in proportion.

----
On the [[GCSE Science/Induction|last]] page we looked at induction. That is how the motor effect acting on electrons in wires causes them to move and create a current. On this page we will look at some practical uses of induction and how electricity is made in power stations.


Look at the diagram of an electric motor. As the coil rotates it cuts the field lines in a downwards direction then an upwards direction. This means that the electricity produced alternates. The current flows one way then the other. The frequency depends on the speed of rotation.

'''Q1)''' A motor is rotated manually to produce a current. An oscilloscope is used to investigate this current and produces a trace like the one shown. The time is on the x axis and voltage is on the y axis.

[[Image:Alternating_current_on_a_'scope.png]]


The motor is speeded up. Which one of the following shows the new trace?

[[Image:Alternating_current_question.Pos_Answers.png]]

==Alternating Current==

In the section above you learned that a dynamo produces a.c. If you've ever looked closely at a school power pack you will probably have noticed that it has a.c. and d.c. outputs. D.c. stands for direct current. The current flows in one direction only and (apart from when it is switched on or off) doesn't change in value. A.c. constantly changes. An a.c. curve is typically that of a sine wave. The current switches back and forth and the value of the current is constantly changing.(This fact is important when we come to study transformers.)

Some devices work equally well with either a.c. or d.c. Others must have the correct type or they won't work. For example think about a child's train on a track.

[[Image:Train on track.png]]

If a.c. electricity is used the train will not go anywhere! This is because the current is 'telling'  the motor to go forwards, go backwards, no, go forwards and so on. Anything with a small electric motor in it has to use d.c. (Special electric motors which use a.c. do exist. However, the ones you'll come across in school or in any toy application will almost certainly be '''d.c.''' motors.)

On the other hand a bulb has no problem working on a.c. This is because a bulb converts the energy of the electric current to heat and light. It makes no difference which way the current flows, the energy is still there. So bulbs, electric fires, cookers and so on do not care if they use a.c. or d.c. 

Transformers (which we will study in the next section) will only work with a.c. This is because a transformer needs to have a constantly varying current, and d.c. only varies when it is switched on or off.

:'''Q2)''' Name a source of a.c. Name a source of d.c.
:'''Q3)''' Name a device that only works with d.c. Name a device which will work with a.c. or d.c.
:'''Q4)''' A hair dryer contains a heating element and a fan. Will it work best with a.c. or d.c.? Explain your answer.
:'''Q5)''' An engineer has an idea about the toy train. He thinks, &quot;If I pass the a.c. through a certain useful electric component, I can get rid of the backward direction current and keep the forward direction current. Like this:

[[Image:Question_on_rectification_diagram.png]]

What useful electrical component was the engineer thinking of?----

      <comment>/* Past tense */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{English in Use}}
'''Verbs''' are often called action words that show what the subject (a noun or pronoun) is doing. A verb is a word that signifies to be, to act, or to be acted on: as, ''I am, I rule, I am ruled, I love, you love, he loves''. Verbs are so called, from the Latin ''verbum'', a word; because the verb is that word which most essentially contains what is said in any clause or sentence. Although described as &quot;action words&quot;, they can describe abstract concepts. They are a requirement of any sentence. Verbs have modifications of four kinds: moods, tenses, persons and numbers.


==Morphological forms==

An English verb has four morphological forms (forms of word formation) ever needful to be ascertained in the first place: the present, the past, the present participle, and the past participle. The third person singular is the fifth morphological form.

The '''present''' is that form of the verb, which is the root of all the rest; the verb itself; or that simple term which we should look for in a dictionary: as, ''be, act, rule, love, defend, terminate''.

The '''past''' is that simple form of the verb, which denotes time past; and which is always connected with some noun or pronoun, denoting the subject of the assertion: as, ''I was, I acted, I ruled, I loved, I defended''.

The '''present participle''' is that form of the verb, which ends commonly in ''ing'', and implies a continuance of the being, action, or passion: as, ''being, acting, ruling, loving, defending, terminating''.

The '''past participle''' is that form of the verb, which ends commonly in ''d'' or ''ed'', and implies what has taken place: as, ''been, acted, ruled, loved''.

==Regularity==

English, like many Germanic languages, contains both strong (or irregular, which is not ''quite'' the same as strong) and weak (regular) verbs. Irregular verbs are one of the most difficult aspects of learning English. Each [[wikt:Appendix:Irregular verbs:English|irregular verb]] must be memorized, because they are not often easy to identify otherwise.

Verbs are divided, with respect to their regularity, into four classes: regular and irregular, redundant and defective.

A '''regular verb''' is a verb that forms the past and the past participle by assuming ''d'' or ''ed'': as, ''love, loved, loving, loved''.

An '''irregular verb''' is a verb that does not form the past and the past participle by assuming ''d'' or ''ed'': as, ''see, saw, seeing, seen''.

A '''redundant verb''' is a verb that forms the past or the past participle in two or more ways, and so as to be both regular and irregular: as, ''thrive, thrived or throve, thriving, thrived or thriven''.

A '''defective verb''' is a verb that forms no participles, and is used in but few of the moods and tenses: as, ''beware, ought, quoth''.

==Persons and numbers==

The person and number of a verb are those modifications in which it agrees with its subject. There are three persons and two numbers: thus,

#Singular first person. I love.
#Singular third person. He loves.
#Plural first person. We love.
#Plural second person. You love.
#Plural third person. They love.

Where the verb is varied, the '''third person singular''' in the present tense, is regularly formed by adding ''s'' or ''es'': as, ''I see, he sees; I give, he gives; I go, he goes; I fly, he flies; I vex, he vexes; I lose, he loses''.

Where the verb is not varied to denote its person and number, these properties are inferred from its subject: as, ''if I love, if he love; if we love, if you love, if they love''.

==Tenses==

Tenses are those modifications of the verb, which distinguish time. There are six tenses; the present, the past, the perfect, the past perfect, the first-future, and the second-future. One could even say there are twelve tenses because each of those comes in simple and in progressive forms, which have different meaning.

The past tense is sometimes called imperfect, but the names perfect and imperfect do not fit their meaning. These names were derived from Latin where they were correct.

The '''[[../Present Simple Tense|present tense simple]]''' is that which expresses what now exists, is normal or correlated to senses. It is used with adverbs like ''always'', ''generally''.

*&quot;There is a house in New Orleans.&quot;
*&quot;I read a book every week.&quot;
*&quot;I hear a noise.&quot;

The '''present tense continuous''' is that which expresses what is temporary:

*&quot;I am reading a letter.&quot;
*&quot;The car is running at high speed.&quot;
*&quot;Someone is always working.&quot;

The '''past tense simple''' is that which expresses what took place in time fully past. It is used with adverbs like ''yesterday'', '' last week''.

*&quot;Last week, I read several of Shaw's novels.&quot;

The '''past tense continuous''' is that which expresses what was taking place when (suddenly) something else occurred.

*&quot;I saw him yesterday, and hailed him as he was passing.&quot;
*&quot;I was giving a presentation when the microphone broke.&quot;

The '''present perfect tense simple''' is that which expresses what has taken place, within some period of time not yet fully past, or is still valid. It is used with adverbs like ''ever'', ''never'', ''today'', ''this week''.

*&quot;I have read several of Shaw's novels.&quot;
*&quot;I have seen him today; something must have detained him.&quot;
*&quot;Have you ever tried fugu fish?&quot;

The '''present perfect tense continuous''' is that which which started in the past and has not yet finished.

*&quot;Since I have been standing here, five planes took off.&quot;

The '''past perfect tense simple''' is that which expresses what had taken place, at some past time mentioned, before something other happened.

*&quot;I had seen him, when I met you.&quot;
*&quot;As soon as my car had been repaired, I could continue my trip.&quot;

The '''past perfect tense continuous''' is that which expresses what had started before and was still going on, when something else occurred.

*&quot;I had been listening to the radio when she dropped in.&quot;

The '''first-future tense simple''' is that which expresses what will take place hereafter.

*&quot;I shall see him again, and I will inform him.&quot;

The '''first-future tense continuous''' is that which expresses what will be currently taking place at a certain time in future.

*&quot;I will be swimming in the sea by the time you'll awake.&quot;

The '''second-future tense simple''' is that which expresses what will have taken place at some future time mentioned.

*&quot;I shall have seen him by tomorrow noon.&quot;

The '''second-future tense continuous''' is that which expresses what will have started at some time and will still be ongoing, at some future time mentioned.

*&quot;I will have been swimming in the sea for four hours by the time you'll awake tomorrow.&quot;

==Signification==

An '''active verb''' is a verb in an active sentence, in which the subject performs the verb: as,

*&quot;I ''hit'' the dog.&quot;

An active verb can be transitive or intransitive, but not passive or neuter.

Verbs are divided again, with respect to their signification, into four classes: transitive, intransitive, passive, and neuter.

A '''transitive verb''' is a verb that expresses an action which has some person or thing for its object: as, 

*&quot;Cain slew Abel.&quot;
*&quot;Cassius loved Brutus.&quot;

An '''intransitive verb''' is a verb that expresses an action which has no person or thing for its object: as, 

*&quot;John walks.&quot;
*&quot;Jesus wept.&quot;

A '''passive verb''' is a verb in a passive sentence (passive voice) that represents its subject, or what the nominative expresses, as being acted on: as,

*&quot;I am compelled.&quot;
*&quot;Caesar was slain.&quot;

In a passive sentence, the action is performed on the subject.

*&quot;I ''hit'' the dog,&quot;
*&quot;The dog was ''hit'' by me.&quot;

These sentences have the same denotative meaning, but their connotative meaning is quite different; active verbs are much more powerful and personal.

A '''neuter verb''' or impersonal passive verb is a verb that expresses neither action nor passion, but simply being, or a state of being: as,

*&quot;There was light.&quot;
*&quot;The babe sleeps.&quot;

==Voice==

Voice of speech can be active or passive. Principally in '''passive voice''' the same tenses can be used as in '''active voice'''. There are two forms of passive voice (the second form is preferred):

*&quot;He gave me the book.&quot; =&gt;
*&quot;The book was given to me,&quot;
*&quot;I was given the book.&quot;

There are however some things to note.

*&quot;They build a house.&quot;
*&quot;The house is built.&quot;

Here active and passive do not really have the same meaning. If for example you describe a picture where people build a house, the first sentence is perfectly correct. The second sentence however will be interpreted as the static perfect of the sentence

*&quot;The house has been built&amp;mdash;it is built now.&quot;

This is, the house is now ready and not under construction. So the correct passive form is

*&quot;The house is being built.&quot;

Passive voice can be built quite formally by adhering to some rules. You will however not find normally all tenses as in active voice. Formal rules will lead you to monstrosities like the following, you will certainly never hear (already the active sentence is quite monstrous):

*&quot;The speech will have been being held for four hours when finally you'll arrive.&quot;
*&quot;The president will have been holding a speech for four hours when finally you'll arrive.&quot;

==Moods==

Moods are different forms of the verb, each of which expresses the being, action, or passion, in some particular manner.

There are five moods; the infinitive, the indicative, the potential, the subjunctive, and the imperative.

The '''infinitive''' mood is that form of the verb, which expresses the being, action, or passion, in an unlimited manner, and without person or number: as,

*&quot;To die,&amp;mdash;to sleep;&amp;mdash;to sleep!&amp;mdash;perchance, to dream!&quot;&amp;mdash;from Hamlet by William Shakespeare.

The '''indicative''' mood is that form of the verb, which simply indicates or declares a thing: as,

*&quot;I write,&quot;
*&quot;You know.&quot;

or asks a question: as,

*&quot;Do you know?&quot;
*&quot;Know you not?&quot;

The '''potential''' mood is that form of the verb which expresses the power, liberty, possibility, or necessity, of the being, action, or passion: as,

*&quot;I can walk.&quot;
*&quot;He may ride.&quot;
*&quot;We must go.&quot;

The '''subjunctive''' mood is that form of the verb, which represents the being, action, or passion, as conditional, doubtful, and contingent: as,

*&quot;If you go, see that you offend not.&quot;
*&quot;See you do it not.&quot;&amp;mdash;Rev., xix, 10.
*&quot;God save the queen.&quot;
*&quot;It is a requirement that ... be done.&quot;
*&quot;It's high time you were in bed.&quot;
*&quot;If I were you,...&quot;

The '''imperative''' mood is that form of the verb which is used in commanding, exhorting, entreating, or permitting: as,

*&quot;Depart you.&quot;
*&quot;Be comforted.&quot;
*&quot;Forgive me.&quot;
*&quot;Go in peace.&quot;

==Conjugation==

The conjugation of a verb is a regular arrangement of its moods, tenses, persons, numbers, and participles.

An '''auxiliary''', or a '''sign''' of a verb, is a short verb prefixed to one of the morphological forms of another verb, to express some particular mode and time of the being, action, or passion. The auxiliaries are ''do, be, have, shall, will, may, can'', and ''must'', with their variations. ''Do'', ''be'', and ''have'' express the indicative mood.

Most often, the auxiliaries are used in the following way:

* When talking about actions that take place in the future, add the word ''will'' before the verb.
* To describe an action that is temporary, add the appropriate form of the verb ''[[wikt:be|be]]'' before the verb and add ''ing'' to the end of the verb root.
* To describe an action that has taken place, put the verb in the past tense and add the appropriate form of the verb ''[[wikt:have|have]]'' before the verb.
* You can combine the previous two auxiliaries by putting the appropriate form of ''have'' before ''been'', and putting both of them before the verb.

===Do===

*Present tense, sign of the present. I do, he does, we do, you do, they do.
*Past tense, sign of the past. I did, he did, we did, you did, they did.

===Be===

*Present tense, sign of the present. I am, he is, we are, you are, they are.
*Past tense, sign of the past. I was, he was, we were, you were, they were.

===Have===

*Present tense, sign of the perfect. I have, he has, we have, you have, they have.
*Past tense, sign of the past perfect. I had, he had, we had, you had, they had.

===Shall and will===

Often confused with each other in modern English. These auxiliaries have distinct meanings, and, as signs of the future, they are interchanged thus:

Present tense, sign of the indicative first-future.

*Simply to express a future action or event: I shall, he will, we shall, you will, they will.
*To express a promise, command, or threat: I will, he will, we will, you will, they will.

Past tense, sign of '''aorist''', or indefinite.

*Used with reference to duty or expediency: I should, he should, we should, you should, they should.
*Used with reference to volition or desire: I would, he would, we would, you would, they would.

'''See also:''' [[w:Shall and will|Shall and will]] by Wikipedia

===May===

*Present tense, sign of the potential present. I may, he may, we may, you may, they may.
*Past tense, sign of the potential past. I might, he might, we might, you might, they might.

===Can===

*Present tense, sign of the potential present. I can, he can, we can, you can, they can.
*Past tense, sign of the potential past. I could, he could, we could, you could, they could.

===Must===

*Present tense, sign of the potential present. I must, he must, we must, you must, they must.

If ''must'' is ever used in the sense of the past tense, the form is the same as that of the present: this word is entirely invariable.

===Is being===

English grammar has changed,

*&quot;The house is being built.&quot;

no longer means the same as

*&quot;The house is built.&quot;

The first sentence refers to an ongoing action, the second to a completed one.

*&quot;If the expression, 'Is being built,' be a correct form of the present indicative passive, then it must be equally correct to say in the perfect, 'Has been being built;' in the past perfect, 'Had been being built;' in the present infinitive, 'To be being built;' in the perfect infinitive, 'To have been being built;' and in the present participle, 'Being being built;' which all will admit to be expressions as incorrect as they are inelegant, but precisely analogous to that which now begins to prevail.&quot;&amp;mdash;Bullions's Principles of English Gram., p. 58.

===Forms of conjugation===

Verb may be conjugated in four ways:

*'''Affirmatively''': as, I write, I do write, or, I am writing; and so on.
*'''Negatively''': as, I write not, I do not write, or, I am not writing.
*'''Interrogatively''': as, write I? do I write? or, am I writing?
*'''Interrogatively and negatively''': as, write I not? do I not write? or, am I not writing?

The verbs would be conjugated affirmatively, unless said otherwise.

==Love, conjugated in simple form==

The verb ''love'' is a regular active verb.

===Simple form, active or neuter===

The simplest form of an English conjugation, is that which makes the present and past tenses without auxiliaries; but, even in these, auxiliaries are required for the potential mood, and are often preferred for the indicative.

===Morphological forms===

&lt;/center&gt;

===Infinite mood===

The infinitive mood is that form of the verb, which expresses the being, action, or passion, in an unlimited manner, and without person or number. It is used only in the present and perfect tenses.

====Present tense====

This tense is the root, or radical verb; and is usually preceded by the preposition to, which shows its relation to some other word: thus,

*To love.

====Perfect tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliary have to the past participle; and, like the infinitive present, is usually preceded by the preposition to: thus,

*To have loved.

===Indicative mood===

The indicative mood is that form of the verb, which simply indicates or declares a thing, or asks a question. It is used in all the tenses.

====Present tense====

The present indicative, in its simple form, is essentially the same as the present infinitive, or '''radical verb'''; except that the verb ''be'' has ''am'' in the indicative.

The simple form of the present tense is varied thus:

*I love, he loves, we love, you love, they love.

This tense may also be formed by prefixing the auxiliary ''do'' to the verb: thus,

*I do love, he does love, we do love, you do love, they do love.

====Past tense====

This tense, in its simple form is the past; which, in all regular verbs, adds ''d'' or ''ed'' to the present, but in others is formed variously.

The simple form of the past tense is varied thus:

*I loved, he loved, we loved, you loved, they loved,

This tense may also be formed by prefixing the auxiliary ''did'' to the present: thus,

*I did love, he did love, we did love, you did love, they did love.
she did love 
‿

====Perfect tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliary ''have'' to the past participle: thus,

*I have loved, he has loved, we have loved, you have loved, they have loved.

====Past perfect tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliary ''had'' to the past participle: thus,

*I had loved, he had loved, we had loved, you had loved, they had loved.

====First-future tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliary ''shall or will'' to the present: thus,

*Simply to express a future action or event: I shall love, he will love, we shall love, you will love, they will love.
*To express a promise, volition, command, or threat: I will love, he shall love, we will love, you shall love, they shall love.

====Second-future tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliaries ''shall have or will have'' to the past participle: thus,

*I shall have loved, he will have loved, we shall have loved, you will have loved, they will have loved.

===Potential mood===

The potential mood is that form of the verb, which expresses the power, liberty, possibility, or necessity of the being, action, or passion. It is used in the first four tenses; but the potential past is properly an aorist: its time is very indeterminate: as,

*&quot;He would be devoid of sensibility were he not greatly satisfied.&quot;&amp;mdash;Lord Kames, El. of Crit., Vol. i, p. 11.

====Present tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliary ''may, can, or must'', to the radical verb: thus,

*I may love, he may love, we may love, you may love, they may love.

====Past tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliary ''might, could, would, or should'', to the radical verb: thus,

*I might love, he might love, we might love, you might love, they might love.

====Perfect tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliaries, ''may have, can have, or must have'', to the past participle: thus,

*I may have loved, he may have loved, we may have loved, you may have loved, they may have loved.

====Past perfect tense====

This tense prefixes the auxiliaries, ''might have, could have, would have, or should have'', to the past participle: thus,

*I might have loved, he might have loved, we might have loved, you might have loved, they might have loved.

===Subjunctive mood===

The subjunctive mood is that form of the verb, which represents the being, action, or passion, as conditional, doubtful, or contingent. This mood is generally preceded by a conjunction: as, ''if, that, though, lest, unless, except''. But sometimes, especially in poetry, it is formed by a mere placing of the verb before the nominative: as,

*&quot;Were I,&quot; for, &quot;If I were;&quot;
*&quot;Had he,&quot; for, &quot;If he had;&quot;
*&quot;Fall we&quot; for, &quot;If we fall;&quot;
*&quot;Knew they,&quot; for, &quot;If they knew.&quot;

It does not vary its termination at all, in the different persons. It is used in the present, and sometimes in the past tense; rarely, and perhaps never properly, in any other. As this mood can be used only in a dependent clause, the time implied in its tenses is always relative, and generally indefinite: as,

*&quot;It shall be in eternal restless change, self-fed, and self-consumed: if this fail, the pillared firmament is rottenness.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton, Comus, l. 596.

====Present tense====

This tense is generally used to express some condition on which a future action or event is affirmed. It is therefore erroneously considered by some grammarians, as an elliptical form of the future.

*If I love, if he love, if we love, if you love, if they love.

In this tense, the auxiliary ''do'' is sometimes employed: as,

*&quot;If you do prosper my way.&quot;&amp;mdash;Genesis, xxiv, 42.
*&quot;If he do not utter it.&quot;&amp;mdash;Leviticus, v, 1.
*&quot;If he do but intimate his desire.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Key, p. 207.
*&quot;If he do promise, he will certainly perform.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., p.  208.
*&quot;An event which, if it ever do occur, must occur in some future period.&quot;&amp;mdash;Hiley's Gram., 3d Ed., Lond., p. 89.
*&quot;If he do but promise, you are safe.&quot;&amp;mdash;Ib., 89.
*&quot;Until old experience do attain to something like prophetic strain.&quot;&amp;mdash;Milton: Il Penseroso.

====Past tense====

*If I loved, if he loved, if we loved, if you loved, if they loved.

This tense, like the past of the potential mood, with which it is frequently connected, is properly an aorist, or indefinite tense; for it may refer to time past, present, or future: as,

*&quot;If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, what further need was there that an other priest should rise?&quot;&amp;mdash;Heb., vii, 11.
*&quot;They must be viewed exactly in the same light, as if the intention to purchase now existed.&quot;&amp;mdash;Murray's Parsing Exercises, p. 24.
*&quot;If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&quot;&amp;mdash;Matt., xxiv, 24.
*&quot;If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Corinthians, xii, 17.
*&quot;If the thankful refrained, it would be pain and grief to them.&quot;&amp;mdash;Atterbury.

===Imperative mood===

*Love [you,] or do you love.

==Defective verbs==

A defective verb is a verb that forms no participles, and is used in but few of the moods and tenses: as, ''beware, ought, quoth''.

List of the defective verbs:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Present !! Past
|-
|Beware||&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;

|-
|Shall|| should
|-
|Will|| would
|-
|Quoth|| quoth
|-
|Wis|| wist
|-

|}

==A short syntax==

The finite verb must agree with its subject, as &quot;The birds fly&quot;, except the following cases: the conjunction ''and'', as &quot;Rhetoric and logic are allied,&quot; one person or thing, as &quot;Flesh and blood has not revealed it,&quot; empathy, as &quot;Consanguinity, and not affinity, is the ground,&quot; ''each'', ''every'', or ''no'', as &quot;No one is the same,&quot; and the conjunction ''or'', as &quot;Fear or jealousy affects him.&quot;

They are the sum of two numbers before (also known as the Fibonacci-sequence):

2 3 5 8 13 21 &lt;b&gt; 34 55 89 &lt;/b&gt;

That is, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 8 = 13 and so on...

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am interested in filling in the gaps in the Physics and Mathematics wikibooks. I will likely start out by elaborating on the existing Electricity and Magentism content, my current area of speciality.

I am currently an undergraduate majoring in physics, philosophy, and bioengineering at UCSD. Although I am a second year, I am taking upper division and graduate courses in physics, and I have taught (informally) and tutored lower division courses in physics. Meanwhile, I've written sections of a physics study guide in modern vernacular. It is called The Slacker's Guide to Physics. (Google it.)

I look forward to adding to wikibooks in my remaining spare time...

      <text xml:space="preserve">This textbook is designed for use with first- and second-year college level physics for engineers and scientists. While the content is not mathematically complicated or very advanced, the students are expected to be familiar with differential calculus and some integral calculus.

Unlike the [[Modern Physics]] textbook, this textbook will stay with the traditional order in presentation of topics in mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and geometric optics. These consist the first two semesters and perhaps first few weeks of the third semester. The topics in modern physics, which can be covered during the third semester in the remaining time, can be presented or read in any order.

In keeping with maintaining the orthodox order, we will also maintain the traditional chapter-section organization. A few suggested break points between semesters are shown below as well. These break points are marked by a horizontal line between chapters.

''(Note to editors: For the purpose of hierarchical organization, at least until the organization of the book is settled down, it should be: &quot;Physics with Calculus/General Topic/Specific Topic&quot;, where &quot;General Topic&quot; is any of the following: Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Waves, Electromagnetism, Optics, Modern. No additional &quot;general topic&quot; should be necessary. &quot;Specific Topic&quot; is what it sounds like it is. It can be as specific as necessary, such as &quot;Conservation of Angular Momentum in Spin-Orbit Coupling&quot;, or as general as necessary, such as &quot;Newton's Laws&quot;. More specific information, such as ordering of chapters will be kept in this module only. This should minimize the need to rename books each time one section moves from one chapter to another, without the unclear &quot;Part I&quot; or &quot;Unit I&quot;.)''

Very few programs follow exactly one control path and have each instruction stated explicitly. In order to program effectively, it is necessary to understand how one can alter the steps taken by a program due to user input or other conditions, how some steps can be executed many times with few lines of code, and how programs can appear to demonstrate a rudimentary grasp of logic. C constructs known as conditionals and loops grant this power.

From this point forward, it is necessary to understand what is usually meant by the word ''block''. A block is a group of code statements that are associated and intended to be executed as a unit. In C, the beginning of a block of code is denoted with { (left curly), and the end of a block is denoted with }. It is not necessary to place a semicolon after the end of a block. Blocks can be empty, as in {}. Blocks can also be nested; i.e. there can be blocks of code within larger blocks.

== Conditionals==

There is likely no meaningful program written in which a computer does not demonstrate basic decision-making skills. It can actually be argued that there is no meaningful human activity in which some sort of decision-making, instinctual or otherwise, does not take place. For example, when driving a car and approaching a traffic light, one does not think, &quot;I will continue driving through the intersection.&quot; Rather, one thinks, &quot;I will stop if the light is red, go if the light is green, and if yellow go only if I am traveling at a certain speed a certain distance from the intersection.&quot; These kinds of processes can be simulated in C using conditionals.

A conditional is a statement that instructs the computer to execute a certain block of code or alter certain data only if a specific condition has been met. The most common conditional is the If-Else statement, with conditional expressions and Switch-Case statements typically used as more shorthanded methods.

Before one can understand conditional statements, it is first necessary to understand how C expresses logical relations. C treats logic as being arithmetic. The value 0 (zero) represents false, and '''''all other values''''' represent true. If you chose some particular value to represent true and then compare values against it, sooner or later your code will fail when your assumed value (often 1) turns out to be incorrect. Code written by people uncomfortable with the C language can often be identified by the usage of #define to make a &quot;TRUE&quot; value.
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.c-faq.com/bool/bool2.html C FAQ]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Because logic is arithmetic in C, arithmetic operators and logical operators are one and the same. Nevertheless, there are a number of operators that are typically associated with logic:

===Relational and Equivalence Expressions:===
; a &lt; b: 1 if '''a''' is less than '''b''', 0 otherwise.
; a &gt; b: 1 if '''a''' is greater than '''b''', 0 otherwise.
; a &lt;= b: 1 if '''a''' is less than or equal to '''b''', 0 otherwise.
; a &gt;= b: 1 if '''a''' is greater than or equal to '''b''', 0 otherwise.
; a == b: 1 if '''a''' is equal to '''b''', 0 otherwise.
; a != b: 1 if '''a''' is not equal to '''b''', 0 otherwise

New programmers should take special note of the fact that the &quot;equal to&quot; operator is ==, not =. This is the cause of numerous coding mistakes and is often a difficult-to-find bug, as the expression &lt;code&gt;(a = b)&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; equal to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and subsequently evaluates to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;; but the expression &lt;code&gt;(a == b)&lt;/code&gt;, which is usually intended, checks if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is equal to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. It needs to be pointed out that, if you confuse = with ==, your mistake will often not be brought to your attention by the compiler. A statement such as &lt;code&gt; if (c = 20) {}&lt;/code&gt; is considered perfectly valid by the language, but will always assign 20 to &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and evaluate as true. A simple technique to avoid this kind of bug (in many, not all cases) is to put the constant first. This will cause the compiler to issue an error, if == got misspelled with =.

Note that C does not have a dedicated boolean type as many other languages do. 0 means false and anything else true. So the following are equivalent:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (foo()) {
   // do something
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

and

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (foo() != 0) {
   // do something
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Often &lt;code&gt;#define TRUE 1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;#define FALSE 0&lt;/code&gt; are used to work around the lack of a boolean type. This is bad practice, since it makes assumptions that do not hold. It is a better idea to indicate what you are actually expecting as a result from a function call, as there are many different ways of indicating error conditions, depending on the situation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (strstr(&quot;foo&quot;, bar) &gt;= 0) {
   // bar contains &quot;foo&quot;
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;strstr&lt;/code&gt; returns the index where the substring foo is found and -1 if it was not found. Note that this would fail with the &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; definition mentioned in the previous paragraph. It would also not produce the expected results if we omitted the &lt;code&gt; &gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;.

One other thing to note is that the relational expressions do not evaluate as they would in mathematical texts. That is, an expression &lt;code&gt;myMin &lt; value &lt; myMax &lt;/code&gt; does not evaluate as you probably think it might. Mathematically, this would test whether or not ''value'' is between ''myMin'' and ''myMax''. But in C, what happens is that ''value'' is first compared with ''myMin''. This produces either a 0 or a 1. It is this value that is compared against myMax.  Example:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int value = 20;
 /* ... */
 if (0 &lt; value &lt; 10) { // don't do this! it always evaluates to &quot;true&quot;!
   /* do some stuff */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Because ''value'' is greater than 0, the first comparison produces a value of 1. Now 1 is compared to be less than 10, which is true, so the statements in the if are executed. This probably is not what the programmer expected.  The appropriate code would be

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int value = 20;
 /* ... */
 if (0 &lt; value &amp;&amp; value &lt; 10) {   // the &amp;&amp; means &quot;and&quot;
   /* do some stuff */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Logical Expressions===
; a || b: when EITHER '''a''' or '''b''' is true (or both), the result is 1, otherwise the result is 0.
; a &amp;&amp; b: when BOTH '''a''' and '''b''' are true, the result is 1, otherwise the result is 0.
; !a: when '''a''' is true, the result is 0, when '''a''' is 0, the result is 1.

Here's an example of a larger logical expression. In the statement:
   e = ((a &amp;&amp; b) || (c &gt; d));
e is set equal to 1 if a and b are non-zero, or if c is greater than d. In all other cases, e is set to 0.

C uses short circuit evaluation of logical expressions. That is to say, once it is
able to determine the truth of a logical expression, it does no further evaluation. This is often useful as in the following:

 int myArray[12];
 ....
 if (i &lt; 12 &amp;&amp; myArray[i] &gt; 3) { 
 ....

In the snippet of code, the comparison of i with 12 is done first.  If it evaluates to 0 (false), '''i''' would be out of bounds as an index to '''myArray'''.  In this case, the program never attempts to access '''myArray[i]''' since the truth of the expression is known to be false. Hence we need not worry here about trying to access an out-of-bounds array element if it is already known that i is greater than or equal to zero.
A similar thing happens with expressions involving the or || operator.

 while (doThis() || doThat()) ...

doThat() is never called if doThis() returns a non-zero (true) value.

===Bitwise Boolean Expressions===

The bitwise operators work bit by bit on the operands. The operands must be of integral type (one of the types used for integers). The six bitwise operators are &amp; (AND), | (OR), ^ (exclusive OR, commonly called XOR), ~ (NOT, which changes 1 to 0 and 0 to 1), &lt;&lt; (shift left), and &gt;&gt; (shift right). The negation operator is a unary operator which precedes the operand. The others are binary operators which lie between the two operands. The precedence of these operators is lower than that of the relational and equivalence operators; it is often required to parenthesize expressions involving bitwise operators.

For this section, recall that a number starting with '''0x''' is hexadecimal, or hex for short. Unlike the normal decimal system using powers of 10 and digits 0123456789, hex uses powers of 16 and digits 0123456789abcdef. Hexadecimal is commonly used in C programs because a programmer can quickly convert it to or from binary (powers of 2 and digits 01). C does not directly support binary notation, which would be really verbose anyway.

; a &amp; b :  bitwise boolean and of '''a''' and '''b'''
: 0xc &amp; 0xa produces the value 0x8 (in binary, 1100 &amp; 1010 produces 1000)

; a | b :  bitwise boolean or of '''a''' and '''b'''
: 0xc | 0xa produces the value 0xe (in binary, 1100 | 1010 produces 1110)

; a ^ b :  bitwise xor of '''a''' and '''b'''
: 0xc ^ 0xa produces the value 0x6 (in binary, 1100 ^ 1010 produces 0110)

; ~a    :  bitwise complement of '''a'''.
: ~0xc produces the value -1-0xc (in binary, ~1100 produces ...11110011 where &quot;...&quot; may be many more 1 bits)

; a &lt;&lt; b :  shift '''a''' left by '''b''' (multiply a by &lt;math&gt;2^b&lt;/math&gt;)
: 0xc &lt;&lt; 1 produces the value 0x18 (in binary, 1100 &lt;&lt; 1 produces the value 11000)

; a &gt;&gt; b :  shift '''a''' right by '''b''' (divide a by &lt;math&gt;2^b&lt;/math&gt;)
: 0xc &gt;&gt; 1 produces the value 0x6 (in binary, 1100 &gt;&gt; 1 produces the value 110)

===The If-Else statement ===

If-Else provides a way to instruct the computer to execute a block of code only if certain conditions have been met. The syntax of an If-Else construct is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (/* condition goes here */) {
   /* if the condition is non-zero (true), this code will execute */
 } else {
   /* if the condition is 0 (false), this code will execute */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The first block of code executes if the condition in parentheses directly after the ''if'' evaluates to non-zero (true); otherwise, the second block executes.

The ''else'' and following block of code are completely optional. If there is no need to execute code if a condition is not true, leave it out.

Also, keep in mind that an ''if'' can directly follow an ''else'' statement. While this can occasionally be useful, chaining more than two or three if-elses in this fashion is considered bad programming practice. We can get around this with the Switch-Case construct described later.

Two other general syntax notes need to be made that you will also see in other control constructs: First, note that there is no semicolon after ''if'' or ''else''. There could be, but the block (code enclosed in { and }) takes the place of that. Second, if you only intend to execute one statement as a result of an ''if'' or ''else'', curly braces are not needed. However, many programmers believe that inserting curly braces anyway in this case is good coding practice.

The following code sets a variable c equal to the greater of two variables a and b, or 0 if a and b are equal.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (a &gt; b) {
   c = a;
 } else if (b &gt; a) {
   c = b;
 } else {
   c = 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;   

Consider this question: why can't you just forget about ''else'' and write the code like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (a &gt; b) {
   c = a;
 }
 
 if (a &lt; b) {
   c = b;
 }
 
 if (a == b) {
   c = 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

There are several answers to this. Most importantly, if your conditionals are not mutually exclusive, ''two'' cases could execute instead of only one. If the code was different and the value of a or b changes somehow (e.g.: you reset the lesser of a and b to 0 after the comparison) during one of the blocks? You could end up with multiple ''if'' statements being invoked, which is not your intent. Also, evaluating ''if'' conditionals takes processor time. If you use ''else'' to handle these situations, in the case above assuming (a &gt; b) is non-zero (true), the program is spared the expense of evaluating additional ''if'' statements.  The bottom line is that it is usually best to insert an ''else'' clause for all cases in which a conditional will not evaluate to non-zero (true).

==== The conditional expression ====

A conditional expression is a way to set values conditionally in a more shorthand fashion than If-Else. The syntax is:

 (/* logical expression goes here */) ? (/* if non-zero (true) */) : (/* if 0 (false) */)

The logical expression is evaluated. If it is non-zero (true), the overall conditional expression evaluates to the expression placed between the ? and :, otherwise, it evaluates to the expression after the :. Therefore, the above example (changing its function slightly such that c is set to b when a and b are equal) becomes:

 c = (a &gt; b) ? a : b;

Conditional expressions can sometimes clarify the intent of the code. Nesting the conditional operator should usually be avoided.  It's best to use conditional expressions only when the expressions for a and b are simple. Also, contrary to a common beginner belief, conditional expressions do not make for faster code. As tempting as it is to assume that fewer lines of code result in faster execution times, there is no such correlation.

=== The Switch-Case statement ===

Say you write a program where the user inputs a number 1-5 (corresponding to student grades, A(represented as 1)-D(4) and F(5)), stores it in a variable '''grade''' and the program responds by printing to the screen the associated letter grade. If you implemented this using If-Else, your code would look something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (grade == 1) {
   printf(&quot;A\n&quot;);
 } else if (grade == 2) {
   printf(&quot;B\n&quot;);
 } else if /* etc. etc. */
&lt;/source&gt;

Having a long chain of if-else-if-else-if-else can be a pain, both for the programmer and anyone reading the code. Fortunately, there's a solution: the Switch-Case construct, of which the basic syntax is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 switch (/* integer or enum goes here */) {
 case /* potential value of the aforementioned int or enum */:
   /* code */
 case /* a different potential value */:
   /* different code */
 /* insert additional cases as needed */
 default: 
   /* more code */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The Switch-Case construct takes a variable, usually an int or an enum, placed after ''switch'', and compares it to the value following the ''case'' keyword. If the variable is equal to the value specified after ''case'', the construct &quot;activates&quot;, or begins executing the code after the case statement. Once the construct has &quot;activated&quot;, there will be no further evaluation of ''case''s. 

Switch-Case is syntactically &quot;weird&quot; in that no braces are required for code associated with a ''case''.

'''''Very important''''':
Typically, the last statement for each case is a break statement. This causes program execution to jump to the statement following the closing bracket of the switch statement, which is what one would normally want to happen.  However if the break statement is omitted, program execution continues with the first line of the next case, if any.  This is called a ''fall-through''.  When a programmer desires this action, a comment should be placed at the end of the block of statements indicating the desire to fall through. Otherwise another programmer maintaining the code could consider the omission of the 'break' to be an error, and inadvertently 'correct' the problem.  Here's an example:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 switch (someVariable) {
 case 1:
   printf(&quot;This code handles case 1\n&quot;);
   break;
 case 2:
   printf(&quot;This prints when someVariable is 2, along with...\n&quot;);
   /* FALL THROUGH */
 case 3:
   printf(&quot;This prints when someVariable is either 2 or 3.\n&quot; );
   break;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

If a ''default'' case is specified, the associated statements are executed if none of the other cases match. A ''default'' case is optional.  Here's a switch statement that corresponds to the sequence of if - else if statements above.

Back to our example above. Here's what it would look like as Switch-Case:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 switch (grade) {
 case 1:
   printf(&quot;A\n&quot;);
   break;
 case 2:
   printf(&quot;B\n&quot;);
   break;
 case 3:
   printf(&quot;C\n&quot;);
   break;
 case 4:
   printf(&quot;D\n&quot;);
   break;
 default:
   printf(&quot;F\n&quot;);
   break;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

A set of statements to execute can be grouped with more than one value of the variable
as in the following example. (the fall-through comment is not necessary here because the intended behavior is obvious)

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 switch (something) {
 case 2:
 case 3:
 case 4:
   /* some statements to execute for 2, 3 or 4 */
   break;
 case 1:
 default:
   /* some statements to execute for 1 or other than 2,3,and 4 */
   break;
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

Switch-Case constructs are particularly useful when used in conjunction with user defined ''enum'' data types. Some compilers are capable of warning about an unhandled enum value, which may be helpful for avoiding bugs.

== Loops ==

Often in computer programming, it is necessary to perform a certain action a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met. It is impractical and tedious to simply type a certain statement or group of statements a large number of times, not to mention that this approach is too inflexible and unintuitive to be counted on to stop when a certain event has happened. As a real-world analogy, someone asks a dishwasher at a restaurant what he did all night. He will respond, &quot;I washed dishes all night long.&quot; He is not likely to respond, &quot;I washed a dish, then washed a dish, then washed a dish, then...&quot;. The constructs that enable computers to perform certain repetitive tasks are called loops.

=== While loops ===

A while loop is the most basic type of loop.  It will run as long as the condition is non-zero (true). For example, if you try the following, the program will appear to lock up and you will have to manually close the program down. A situation where the conditions for exiting the loop will never become true is called an infinite loop. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int a = 1;
 while (42) {
   a = a * 2;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is another example of a while loop. It prints out all the powers of two less
than 100.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int a = 1;
 while (a &lt; 100) {
   printf(&quot;a is %d \n&quot;, a);
   a = a * 2;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The flow of all loops can also be controlled by '''break''' and '''continue''' statements.  A break statement will immediately exit the enclosing loop.  A continue statement will skip the remainder of the block and start at the controlling conditional statement again.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int a = 1;
 while (42) { // loops until the break statement in the loop is executed
   printf(&quot;a is %d &quot;, a);
   a = a * 2;
   if (a &gt; 100) {
     break;
   } else if (a == 64) {
     continue;  // Immediately restarts at while, skips next step
   }
   printf(&quot;a is not 64\n&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, the computer prints the value of a as usual, and prints a notice that a is not 64 (unless it was skipped by the continue statement).

Similar to If above, braces for the block of code associated with a While loop can be omitted if the code consists of only one statement, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int a = 1;
 while (a &lt; 100)
   a = a * 2;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will merely increase a until a is not less than 100.

When the computer reaches the end of the while loop, it always goes back to the while statement at the top of the loop, where it re-evaluates the controlling condition.
If that condition is &quot;true&quot; at that instant -- even if it was temporarily 0 for a few statements inside the loop -- then the computer begins executing the statements inside the loop again; otherwise the computer exits the loop.
The computer does not &quot;continuously check&quot; the controlling condition of a while loop during the execution of that loop.
It only &quot;peeks&quot; at the controlling condition each time it reaches the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the loop.

It is very important to note, once the controlling condition of a While loop becomes 0 (false), the loop will not terminate until the block of code is finished and it is time to reevaluate the conditional. If you need to terminate a While loop immediately upon reaching a certain condition, consider using '''break'''.

A common idiom is to write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int i = 5;
 while (i--) {
   printf(&quot;java and c# can't do this\n&quot;);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This executes the code in the while loop 5 times, with i having values that range from 4 down to 0 (inside the loop). Conveniently, these are the values needed to access every item of an array containing 5 elements.

=== For loops ===

For loops generally look something like this:

 for (''initialization''; ''test''; ''increment'') {
   /* code */
 }

The ''initialization'' statement is executed exactly once - before the first evaluation of the ''test'' condition.  Typically, it is used to assign an initial value to some variable, although this is not strictly necessary. The ''initialization'' statement can also be used to declare and initialize variables used in the loop.

The ''test'' expression is evaluated each time before the code in the ''for'' loop executes. If this expression evaluates as 0 (false) when it is checked (i.e. if the expression is not true), the loop is not (re)entered and execution continues normally at the code immediately following the FOR-loop.  If the expression is non-zero (true), the code within the braces of the loop is executed. 

After each iteration of the loop, the ''increment'' statement is executed. This often is used to increment the loop index for the loop, the variable initialized in the initialization expression and tested in the test expression.  Following this statement execution, control returns to the top of the loop, where the ''test'' action occurs. If a ''continue'' statement is executed within the ''for'' loop, the increment statement would be the next one executed. 

Each of these parts of the for statement is optional and may be omitted.  Because of the free-form nature of the for statement, some fairly fancy things can be done with it. Often a for loop is used to loop through items in an array, processing each item at a time. 
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int myArray[12];
 int ix;
 for (ix = 0; ix &lt; 12; ix++) {
   myArray[ix] = 5 * ix + 3;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The above for loop initializes each of the 12 elements of myArray.
The loop index can start from any value. In the following case it starts from 1.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (ix = 1; ix &lt;= 10; ix++) {
   printf(&quot;%d &quot;, ix);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

which will print
 '''1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 '''

You will most often use loop indexes that start from 0, since arrays are indexed at zero, but you will sometimes use other values to initialize a loop index as well.

The ''increment'' action can do other things, such as ''decrement''.  So this kind of loop is common:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (i = 5; i &gt; 0; i--) {
   printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

which yields
 '''5 4 3 2 1 '''

Here's an example where the test condition is simply a variable. If the variable
has a value of 0 or NULL, the loop exits, otherwise the statements in the body of
the loop are executed.
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (t = list_head; t; t = NextItem(t)) {
   /* body of loop */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

A WHILE loop can be used to do the same thing as a FOR loop, however a FOR loop is a more condensed way to perform a set number of repetitions since all of the necessary information is in a one line statement.

A FOR loop can also be given no conditions, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 for (;;) {
   /* block of statements */
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This is called an infinite loop since it will loop forever unless there is a break statement within the statements of the for loop. The empty test condition effectively evaluates as true.

It is also common to use the comma operator in for loops to execute multiple statements. 
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int i, j, n = 10;
 for (i = 0, j = 0; i &lt;= n; i++, j += 2) {
   printf(&quot;i = %d , j = %d \n&quot;, i, j);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;


Special care should be taken when designing or refactoring the conditional part, especially whether using &lt; or &lt;= , whether start and stop should be corrected by 1, and in case of prefix- and postfix-notations. ( On a 100 yards promenade with a tree every 10 yards there are 11 trees. )

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int i, n = 10;
 for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
   printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i); // processed n times =&gt; 0 1 2 3 ... (n-1)
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
 for (i = 0; i &lt;= n; i++)
   printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i); // processed (n+1) times =&gt; 0 1 2 3 ... n 
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
 for (i = n; i--;)
   printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i); // processed n times =&gt; (n-1) ...3 2 1 0 
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
 for (i = n; --i;)
   printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i); // processed (n-1) times =&gt; (n-1) ...4 3 2 1 
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Do-While loops ===

A DO-WHILE loop is a post-check while loop, which means that it checks the condition after each run.  As a result, even if the condition is zero (false), it will run at least once.  It follows the form of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 do {
   /* do stuff */
 } while (condition);
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the terminating semicolon.  This is required for correct syntax.  Since this is also a type of while loop,  '''break''' and '''continue''' statements within the loop function accordingly. A '''continue''' statement causes a jump to the test of the condition and a ''break'' statement exits the loop.

It is worth noting that Do-While and While are functionally almost identical, with one important difference: Do-While loops are always guaranteed to execute at least once, but While loops will not execute at all if their condition is 0 (false) on the first evaluation.

== One last thing: goto ==

'''goto''' is a very simple and traditional control mechanism. It is a statement used to immediately and unconditionally jump to another line of code. To use goto, you must place a label at a point in your program. A label consists of a name followed by a colon (:) on a line by itself. Then, you can type &quot;goto ''label'';&quot; at the desired point in your program. The code will then continue executing beginning with ''label''. This looks like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 MyLabel:
   /* some code */
   goto MyLabel;
&lt;/source&gt;

The ability to transfer the flow of control enabled by gotos is so powerful that, in addition to the simple if, all other control constructs can be written using gotos instead. Here, we can let &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; be any arbitrary statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (''cond'') {
   S;
 } else {
   T;
 }
 /* ... */
&lt;/source&gt;

The same statement could be accomplished using two gotos and two labels:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 if (''cond'') goto Label1;
   T;
   goto Label2;
 Label1:
   S;
 Label2:
   /* ... */
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the first goto is conditional on the value of &quot;cond&quot;. The second goto is unconditional. We can perform the same translation on a loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 while (''cond1'') {
   S;
   if (''cond2'')
     break;
   T;
 }
 /* ... */
&lt;/source&gt;

Which can be written as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 Start:
   if (!''cond1'') goto End;
   S;
   if (''cond2'') goto End;
   T;
   goto Start;
 End:
   /* ... */
&lt;/source&gt;

As these cases demonstrate, often the structure of what your program is doing can usually be expressed without using gotos. Undisciplined use of gotos can create unreadable, unmaintainable code when more idiomatic alternatives (such as if-elses, or for loops) can better express your structure. Theoretically, the goto construct does not ever ''have'' to be used, but there are cases when it can increase readability, avoid code duplication, or make control variables unnecessary. You should consider first mastering the idiomatic solutions, and use goto only when necessary.  Keep in mind that many, if not most, C style guidelines ''strictly forbid'' use of '''goto''', with the  only common exceptions being the following examples.

One use of goto is to break out of a deeply nested loop. Since '''break''' will not work (it can only escape one loop), '''goto''' can be used to jump completely outside the loop. Breaking outside of deeply nested loops without the use of the goto is always possible, but often involves the creation and testing of extra variables that may make the resulting code far less readable than it would be with '''goto'''. The use of '''goto''' makes it easy to undo actions in an orderly fashion, typically to avoid failing to free memory that had been allocated.

Another accepted use is the creation of a state machine. This is a fairly advanced topic though, and not commonly needed.

== Examples ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
	int years;

	printf(&quot;Enter your age in years : &quot;);
	fflush(stdout);
	errno = 0;
	if (scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;years) != 1 || errno)
		return EXIT_FAILURE;
	printf(&quot;Your age in days is %d\n&quot;, years * 365);
	return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

In C programming, all executable code resides within a '''function'''.  A function is a named block of code that performs a task and then returns control to a caller. Note that other programming languages may distinguish between a &quot;function&quot;, &quot;subroutine&quot;, &quot;subprogram&quot;, &quot;procedure&quot;, or &quot;method&quot; -- in C, these are all functions.

A function is often executed (called) several times, from several different places, during a single execution of the program.
After finishing a subroutine, the program will branch back (return) to the point after the call.

Functions are a powerful programming tool.

As a basic example, suppose you are writing code to print out the first 5 squares of numbers, do some intermediate processing, then print the first 5 squares again. We could write it like this:
  
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int i;
  for(i=1; i &lt;= 5; i++)
  {
     printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i*i);
  }
  for(i=1; i &lt;= 5; i++)
  {
     printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i*i);
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We have to write the same loop twice. We may want to somehow put this code in a separate place and simply jump to this code when we want to use it.  This would look like:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void Print_Squares(void)
{
  int i;
  for(i=1; i &lt;=5; i++)
  {
    printf(&quot;%d &quot;, i*i);
  }
}

int main(void)
{
  Print_Squares();
  Print_Squares();
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This is precisely what functions are for.

== More on functions==
A function is like a black box. It takes in input, does something with it, then spits out an answer.

Note that a function may not take any inputs at all, or it may not return anything at all. In the above example, if we were to make a function of that loop, we may not need any inputs, and we aren't returning anything at all (Text output doesn't count - when we speak of ''returning'' we mean to say meaningful data that the program can use).

We have some terminology to refer to functions:
* A function, call it ''f'', that uses another function ''g'', is said to ''call'' ''g''. For example, ''f'' calls ''g'' to print the squares of ten numbers.
* A function's inputs are known as its ''arguments''
* A function ''g'' that gives some kind of answer back to ''f'' is said to ''return'' that answer.  For example, ''g'' returns the sum of its arguments.

== Writing functions in C==
It's always good to learn by example. Let's write a function that will return the square of a number.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int square(int x)
{
   int square_of_x;
   square_of_x = x * x;
   return square_of_x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To understand how to write such a function like this, it may help to look at what this function does as a whole. It takes in an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, x, and squares it, storing it in the variable square_of_x. Now this value is returned. 

The first int at the beginning of the function declaration is the type of data that the function returns. In this case when we square an integer we get an integer, and we are returning this integer, and  so we write &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; as the return type.

Next is the name of the function. It is good practice to use meaningful and descriptive names for functions you may write. It may help to name the function after what it is written to do. In this case we name the function &quot;square&quot;, because that's what it does - it squares a number.

Next is the function's first and only argument, an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, which will be referred to in the function as x. This is the function's ''input''. 

In between the braces is the actual guts of the function. It declares an integer variable called square_of_x that will be used to hold the value of the square of x. Note that the variable square_of_x can '''only''' be used within this function, and not outside. We'll learn more about this sort of thing later, and we will see that this property is very useful. 

We then assign x multiplied by x, or x squared, to the variable square_of_x, which is what this function is all about.  Following this is a &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; statement. We want to return the value of the square of x, so we must say that this function returns the contents of the variable square_of_x.

Our brace to close, and we have finished the declaration.

Written in a more concise manner, this code performs exactly the same function as the above:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
int square(int x)
{
   return x * x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note this should look familiar - you have been writing functions already, in fact - main is a function that is always written.

=== In general ===
In general, if we want to declare a function, we write
  ''type'' ''name''(''type1'' ''arg1'', ''type2'' ''arg2'', ...)
  {
    /* ''code'' */
  } 

We've previously said that a function can take no arguments, or can return nothing, or both. What do we write if we want the function to return nothing? We use C's &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; basically means &quot;nothing&quot; - so if we want to write a function that returns nothing, for example, we write

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void sayhello(int number_of_times)
{
  int i;
  for(i=1; i &lt;= number_of_times; i++) {
     printf(&quot;Hello!\n&quot;);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that there is no &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; statement in the function above. Since there's none, we write &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; as the return type. (Actually, one can use the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; keyword in a procedure to return to the caller before the end of the procedure, but one cannot return a value as if it were a function.)

What about a function that takes no arguments? If we want to do this, we can write for example

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
float calculate_number(void)
{
  float to_return=1;
  int i;
  for(i=0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
     to_return += 1;
     to_return = 1/to_return;
  }
  return to_return;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice this function doesn't take any inputs, but merely returns a number calculated by this function.

Naturally, you can combine both void return and void in arguments together to get a valid function, also.

=== Recursion ===

Here's a simple function that does an infinite loop. It prints a line and calls itself, which again prints a line and calls itself again, and this continues until the stack overflows and the program crashes. A function calling itself is called recursion, and normally you will have a conditional that would stop the recursion after a small, finite number of steps.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
      // don't run this!
void infinite_recursion()
{
    printf(&quot;Infinite loop!\n&quot;);
    infinite_recursion();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A simple check can be done like this. Note that ++depth is used so the increment will take place before the value is passed into the function. Alternatively you can increment on a separate line before the recursion call. If you say print_me(3,0); the function will print the line Recursion 3 times.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void print_me(int j, int depth)
{
   if(depth &lt; j) {
       printf(&quot;Recursion! depth = %d j = %d\n&quot;,depth,j); //j keeps its value
       print_me(j, ++depth);
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Recursion is most often used for jobs such as directory tree scans, seeking for the end of a linked list, parsing a tree structure in a database and factorising numbers (and finding primes) among other things.

=== Static functions ===

If a function is to be called only from within the file in which it is declared, it 
is appropriate to declare it as a static function.  When a function is declared static, the compiler will now compile to an object file in a way that prevents the function from being called from code in other files.   Example:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
static int compare( int a, int b )
{
    return (a+4 &lt; b)? a : b;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Using C functions==
We can now ''write'' functions, but how do we use them? When we write main, we place the function outside the braces that encompass main.

When we want to use that function, say, using our &lt;tt&gt;calculate_number&lt;/tt&gt; function above, we can write something like

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 float f;
 f = calculate_number();
&lt;/source&gt;

If a function takes in arguments, we can write something like

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 int square_of_10;
 square_of_10 = square(10);
&lt;/source&gt;

If a function doesn't return anything, we can just say

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 say_hello();
&lt;/source&gt;
since we don't need a variable to catch its return value.

== Functions from the C Standard Library == 
While the C language doesn't itself contain functions, it is usually linked with the C Standard Library.  To use this library, you need to add an #include directive at the top of the C file, which may be one of the following:

{|
|
* &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Assert.h|&lt;assert.h&gt;]]&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;[[w:Ctype.h|&lt;ctype.h&gt;]]&lt;/tt&gt;

== Variable-length argument lists ==
Functions with variable-length argument lists are functions that can take a varying number of arguments. An example in the C standard library is the &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; function, which can take any number of arguments depending on how the programmer wants to use it.

C programmers rarely find the need to write new functions with variable-length arguments.
If they want to pass a bunch of things to a function, they typically define a structure to hold all those things -- perhaps a linked list, or an array -- and call that function with the data in the arguments.

However, you may occasionally find the need to write a new function that supports a variable-length argument list.
To create a function that can accept a variable-length argument list, you must first include the standard library header &lt;tt&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/tt&gt;. Next, declare the function as you would normally. Next, add as the last argument an ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;). This indicates to the compiler that a variable list of arguments is to follow. For example, the following function declaration is for a function that returns the average of a list of numbers:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
  float average (int n_args, ...);
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that because of the way variable-length arguments work, we must somehow, in the arguments, specify the number of elements in the variable-length part of the arguments. In the &lt;tt&gt;average&lt;/tt&gt; function here, it's done through an argument called &lt;tt&gt;n_args.&lt;/tt&gt; In the &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; function, it's done with the format codes that you specify in that first string in the arguments you provide.

Now that the function has been declared as using variable-length arguments, we must next write the code that does the actual work in the function.
To access the numbers stored in the variable-length argument list for our &lt;tt&gt;average&lt;/tt&gt; function, we must first declare a variable for the list itself:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
  va_list myList;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;va_list&lt;/tt&gt; type is a type declared in the &lt;tt&gt;stdarg.h&lt;/tt&gt; header that basically allows you to keep track of your list. To start actually using &lt;tt&gt;myList&lt;/tt&gt;, however, we must first assign it a value. After all, simply declaring it by itself wouldn't do anything. To do this, we must call &lt;tt&gt;va_start&lt;/tt&gt;, which is actually a macro defined in &lt;tt&gt;stdarg.h.&lt;/tt&gt; In the arguments to &lt;tt&gt;va_start&lt;/tt&gt;, you must provide the &lt;tt&gt;va_list&lt;/tt&gt; variable you plan on using, as well as the name of the last variable appearing before the ellipsis in your function declaration:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
float average (int n_args, ...)
{
    va_list myList;
    va_start (myList, n_args);
    va_end (myList);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now that &lt;tt&gt;myList&lt;/tt&gt; has been prepped for usage, we can finally start accessing the variables stored in it. To do so, use the &lt;tt&gt;va_arg&lt;/tt&gt; macro, which pops off the next argument on the list. In the arguments to &lt;tt&gt;va_arg&lt;/tt&gt;, provide the &lt;tt&gt;va_list&lt;/tt&gt; variable you're using, as well as the primitive data type (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;) that the variable you're accessing should be:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
float average (int n_args, ...)
{
    va_list myList;
    va_start (myList, n_args);
    
    int myNumber = va_arg (myList, int);
    va_end (myList);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

By popping &lt;tt&gt;n_args&lt;/tt&gt; integers off of the variable-length argument list, we can manage to find the average of the numbers:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
float average (int n_args, ...)
{
    va_list myList;
    va_start (myList, n_args);
    
    int numbersAdded = 0;
    int sum = 0;
     
    while (numbersAdded &lt; n_args) {
        int number = va_arg (myList, int); // Get next number from list
        sum += number;
        numbersAdded += 1;
    }
    va_end (myList);
     
    float avg = (float)(sum) / (float)(numbersAdded); // Find the average
    return avg;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

By calling &lt;tt&gt;average (2, 10, 20)&lt;/tt&gt;, we get the average of &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;, which is &lt;tt&gt;15.&lt;/tt&gt;

Having covered the basic concepts of C programming, we can now briefly discuss the process of ''compilation''.

Like any programming language, C by itself is completely incomprehensible to a [[w:microprocessor|microprocessor]]. Its purpose is to provide an intuitive way for humans to provide instructions that can be easily converted into machine code that ''is'' comprehensible to a microprocessor. The '''''compiler''''' is what takes this code, and translates it into the machine code. 

To those new to programming, this seems fairly simple. A naive compiler might read in every source file, translate everything into machine code, and write out an executable. This could work, but has two serious problems. First, for a large project, the computer may not have enough memory to read all of the source code at once. Second, if you make a change to a single source file, you would rather not have to recompile the ''entire'' application. 

To deal with these problems, compilers break their job down into steps; for each source file (each &lt;code&gt;.c&lt;/code&gt; file), the compiler reads the file, reads the files it references with &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;, and translates it to machine code. The result of this is an &quot;object file&quot; (&lt;code&gt;.o&lt;/code&gt;). Once every object file is made, a &quot;linker&quot; collects all of the object files and writes the actual program. This way, if you change one source file, only that file needs to be recompiled and then the application needs to be re-linked. 

Without going into the painful details, it can be beneficial to have a superficial understanding of the compilation process. 

== Preprocessor ==
The preprocessor provides the ability for the inclusion of header files, macro expansions, conditional compilation, and line control.
Many times you will need to give special instructions to your compiler. This is done by inserting preprocessor [[w:Preprocessor directives|directives]] into your code. When you begin compiling your code, a special program called the preprocessor scans the source code and performs simple substitution of tokenized strings for others according to predefined rules. The preprocessor is not a part of the C language.

In C language, all preprocessor directives begin with the pound character (#). You can see one preprocessor directive in the [[Hello world program]] introduced in [[C Programming/A taste of C|A taste of C]]:

Example: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

This directive causes the header to be included into your program. Other directives such as &lt;code&gt;#pragma&lt;/code&gt; control compiler settings and macros. The result of the preprocessing stage is a text string. You can think of the preprocessor as a non-interactive text editor that prepares your code for the compilation step.
The language of preprocessor directives is agnostic to the grammar of C, so the C preprocessor can also be used independently to process other kinds of text files.

== Syntax Checking ==
This step ensures that the code is valid and will sequence into an executable program. Under most compilers, you may get messages or warnings indicating potential issues with your program (such as a statement always being true or false, etc.) 

When an error is detected in the program, the compiler will normally report the file name and line that is preventing compilation.

== Object Code ==
The compiler produces a machine code equivalent of the source code that can then be linked into the final program. The code itself can't be executed yet, as it has to complete the linking stage. 

It's important to note after discussing the basics that compilation is a &quot;one way street&quot;. That is, compiling a C source file into machine code is easy, but &quot;decompiling&quot; (turning machine code into the C source that creates it) is not. Decompilers for C do exist, but they rarely create useful code.

== Linking ==
Linking combines the separate object codes into one complete program by integrating libraries and the code and producing either an [[W:Executable|executable program]] or a [[W:Library (computing)|library]]. Linking is performed by a linker, which is often part of a compiler.

Common errors during this stage are either missing functions, or duplicate functions.

== Automation ==
For large C projects, many programmers choose to automate compilation, both in order to reduce user interaction requirements and to speed up the process by only recompiling modified files.

Most integrated development environments have some kind of project management, which makes such automation very easy. On UNIX-like systems, [[make]] and Makefiles are often used to accomplish the same.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Hephaestos. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Hephaestos~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recall from the previous section that we considered the case where '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; analogous to modular arithmetic but with polynomials, and that when we are looking at numbers modulo ''n'', we have a field iff '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a field if ''n'' is prime.

Can we say something similar about '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;? Indeed, if m(''x'') is irreducible then '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; is a field.

This section deals with these kinds of fields, known as a '''finite field'''.

== Definitions==
We have the object '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; where this is the set of polynomials in '''F'''[''x''] are divided by the polynomial m(''x'').

Of the elements in '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; we can easily define addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and so on normally but with a reduction modulo m(''x'') to get the desired remainder.

We have that '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; is a commutative ring with identity, and if m(''x'') is irreducible then '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; is a field. 

If m(''x'') has degree ''n'', then 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}[x] / \langle m(x) \rangle = \{ a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + a_{n-2} x^{n-2} + \dots + a_0 x^0 | a_i \in \mathbf{F} \} &lt;/math&gt;

If '''F''' is '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (so ''p'' is prime) then &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{F}[x] / \langle m(x) \rangle | = p^n&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties==
Now remember with complex numbers '''C''', we have &quot;invented&quot; the symbol i to stand for the root of the solution ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1=0. In fact, we have '''C'''='''R'''[''x'']/&lt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&gt;. 

When we have a ''general'' finite field, we can do this also. We write this often as '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;='''F'''(&amp;alpha;) where &amp;alpha; is &quot;the root of&quot; m(''x'') - we ''define'' &amp;alpha; to be the root of m(''x'').

'''F'''(&amp;alpha;) in fact is the smallest field which contains '''F''' and &amp;alpha;.

== Finite field theorems ==
We have a number of theorems associated with finite fields. 

# If '''F''' is a finite field, |'''F'''|=''q'', then ''q''=''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''k'' &lt;math&gt;\ge&lt;/math&gt; 1 and ''p'' prime. 
# There then is a monic irreducible polynomial m(''x'') with degree ''k'' such that '''F'''='''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;='''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) with &amp;alpha; a root of m(''x'') over '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
# There is an element &amp;gamma;&amp;isin;'''F''' such that the order (the least element ''n'' such that &amp;gamma;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=1) of &amp;gamma; is ''q''-1, so &amp;gamma; is primitive in '''F''', and we can generate elements of '''F''' (not zero) from powers of &amp;gamma;, i.e. '''F'''={0, &amp;gamma;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=1, &amp;gamma;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., &amp;gamma;&lt;sup&gt;q-2&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;gamma;&lt;sup&gt;q-1&lt;/sup&gt;=1}
# '''F''' is a [[Algebra/Vector space|vector space]] with dimension ''k'' over '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. It has basis {1, &amp;alpha;, &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,...,&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;} where ''n'' is the degree of m(''x''), so we have '''F'''={''a''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;+...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;isin;'''F'''}
# If ''a''&amp;isin;F, ''a''+...+''a'' ''p'' times (''pa'') is 0.
# If m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is any other irreducible polynomial of degree ''k'' over '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; then '''F''' is ''isomorphic'' (meaning basically equal to, except for a change in symbols) to '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&gt; - so all ways of writing this field are basically the same. So there is essentially one field of size ''q''=''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; and we denote it GF(''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;) (GF meaning [[w:Evariste Galois|Galois]] Field).

== Some examples==
Let's look at a few examples that go through these ideas. 

=== The complex numbers===
[[Algebra/Complex Numbers|Complex numbers]], briefly, are numbers in the form
: &lt;math&gt; a + bi&lt;/math&gt;
where ''i'' is the solution to the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1=0

These numbers in fact form a field, however it is not a finite field. 

Take m(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1, with the field '''F''' being '''R'''. Then we can form the complex numbers as '''F'''/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;. Now '''F'''/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; = { ''a''+''bx'' | ''a'', ''b'' &amp;isin; '''R'''} because the remainders must be of degree less than m(''x'') - which is 2.

So then (''a''+''bx'')(''c''+''dx'')=''ac''+''bdx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(''ad''+''bc'')''x''.

But remember that we are working in '''F'''/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;. So ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modulo ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1, can be written as (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1)-1=-1, and substituting -1 above yields a rather familiar expression.

If we let the symbol ''i'' to be the &quot;root of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;, then ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1=0 and ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1. The rest of the field axioms follow from here. We can then say the complex numbers '''C'''='''R'''/&lt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&gt;='''R'''(''i'').

=== The '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; case ===
We can still do this for some field in general. Let's take '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for example, and pick m(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2. m(''x'') is irreducible - m(0)=2, m(1)=4=1, m(2)=4+2+2=8=2.

So '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2&gt; is a finite field. Assume &amp;alpha; is a root of m(''x''). Then '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) = { ''a''+''b''&amp;alpha;|''a'', ''b'' &amp;isin; '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}. Since '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2&gt; is finite, we can list out all its elements. We have the constant terms, then the &amp;alpha; terms, then the &amp;alpha;+constant terms, and so on. We have {0, 1, 2, &amp;alpha;, &amp;alpha;+1, &amp;alpha;+2, 2&amp;alpha;, 2&amp;alpha;+1, 2&amp;alpha;+2}.

Now we have &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;alpha;+2=0, then
: &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-&amp;alpha;-2
: &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=2&amp;alpha;-2=2&amp;alpha;+1
(Recall the coefficients are in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;! We are working in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;)

We can verify multiplication works mod m(''x'') - for example
: (1+2&amp;alpha;)(2+&amp;alpha;) = 2 + &amp;alpha;+4&amp;alpha;+2&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
Reducing coefficients normally mod 3 we get
: (1+2&amp;alpha;)(2+&amp;alpha;) = 2 + 2&amp;alpha; + 2&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
Now using the formula above for &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: (1+2&amp;alpha;)(2+&amp;alpha;) 
:: = 2 + 2&amp;alpha; + 2(2&amp;alpha;+1) 
:: = 2 + 2&amp;alpha;+4&amp;alpha;+2
:: = 2 + 6&amp;alpha;+2
:: = 2 + 2 = 4 = 1

Verify for yourself that multiplication and other operations work too.

== Primitive elements==
Recall from [[../Modular arithmetic/]] that the order of a number ''a'' modulo ''n'', in a field, is the least power such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''-1&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''k'' the size of this field. Since the order is defined over a field, this leads us to consider whether we have primitive elements in '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt; - which we do. If we have '''F'''(&amp;alpha;), just like in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;alpha; is primitive iff the order of &amp;alpha; is ''q''-1 where ''q'' is the number of elements in '''F'''[''x'']/&lt;m(''x'')&gt;.

Let's take '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+1&gt;. Is &amp;alpha; (root of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+1) primitive?

First, if &amp;alpha; is a root of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+1, 
:&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;alpha;+1=0
:&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-&amp;alpha;-1=&amp;alpha;+1

Now, let us calculate powers of &amp;alpha;
: 1, &amp;alpha;
: &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=&amp;alpha;+1
: &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=&amp;alpha;(&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)=&amp;alpha;(&amp;alpha;+1)=&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+&amp;alpha;=(&amp;alpha;+1)+&amp;alpha;=1

Recall that the size of this field is 4 (the ''n'' in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, in this case, 2, raised to the power of the degree of the polynomial, in this case 2). Now we have &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;4-1&lt;/sup&gt;=1, and &amp;alpha; is primitive.

We generally want to look at powers of &amp;alpha; in '''F'''(&amp;alpha;), to see whether they are primitive, since we already know about the orders of the constants in '''F'''(&amp;alpha;) - which we've looked at in [[../Modular arithmetic/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi.

Brief personal introduction: I am involved in academia, education, and community work.

What brings me here?

I am am extremely interested in the idea of creating a virtual home for open-source annotated texts, a home where readers could create their own commentaries, introductions, critical apparatus, or any other aids for reading and study that might be interesting and helpful.

I strongly feel that such a project should be a separate project from Wikibooks.  There is a fundamental difference between creating a school textbook, where the text is primarily a means for presenting the ''topic'', versus a primary text where the ''text'' itself is at the center of attention.

But meanwhile the annotated texts are here, and I'd be happy to help contribute what I can to them.

(By the way, yes, I have read the discussion about &quot;Project Sourceberg.&quot;)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Noldoaran. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Noldoaran~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GenBioTOC}}
The word '''''biology''''' means, &quot;the science of life&quot;, from the Greek ''' bios,'''  ''life'', and ''' logos,''' ''word'' or ''knowledge.'' Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is sometimes known as Life Science.

The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as [[botany]], bacteriology, [[anatomy]], zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, [[genetics]], [[Molecular Biology|molecular biology]], systematics, immunology, [[microbiology]], physiology, [[Cell Biology|cell biology]], cytology, [[ecology]], and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies, including [[paleontology]], taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, entomology,  biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and anthropology. 


== Characteristics of life ==

Not all scientists agree on the definition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving being classified as living or something living classified as nonliving. Therefore we are careful not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.

*Living things are composed of '''matter structured in an orderly way''' where simple molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.

An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C
All organisms;
- '''G'''row, '''R'''espire, '''I'''nteract, '''M'''ove, Need '''N'''utrients, '''E'''xcrete (Waste), '''R'''eproduce,'''D'''eath, '''C'''ells (Made of)

*Living things are '''sensitive,''' meaning they are able to ''' respond to stimuli. '''

*Living things are able to '''grow''', '''develop''', and '''reproduce'''. 

*Living things are able to '''adapt''' over time by the process of '''natural selection'''.

*All known living things use the '''hereditary molecule, [[w:DNA|DNA]]'''.

*Internal functions are coordinated and '''regulated''' so that the internal environment of a living thing is relatively constant, referred to as '''[[w:homeostasis|homeostasis]].'''

Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to [[w:cell|cells]]. Atoms are arranged into molecules, then into [[w:macromolecule|macromolecules]], which make up [[w:organelle|organelles]], which work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire multicellular organisms. Cells together form [[General Biology/Tissues|tissues]], which make up organs, which are part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earth's ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.

Example:-

sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population, community, eco systems

'''Emergent property''' is viewed in the biological organization of life, ranging from the subatomic level to the entire biosphere. Emergent properties are not unique to life, but biological systems are far more complex, making the emergent properties of life difficult to study.

'''Systems biology''' is a biology-based inter-disciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach.

Biologists study properties of life, with reductionist approach and holistic approach.

== Nature of science ==

Science is a '''methodology''' for '''learning about the world'''. It involves the '''application of knowledge'''.

The scientific method deals with '''systematic investigation''', '''reproducible results''', the formation and testing of '''hypotheses''', and '''reasoning.''' 

Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, '''induction''' (specific data is used to develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and '''deduction''' (general information leads to specific conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.

Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.

== Scientific method ==


The scientific method is not a step by step, linear process.  It is an intuitive process, a methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge.  Scientists must be able to have an &quot;imaginative preconception&quot; of what the truth is.  Scientists will often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred.  They use all of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that might be true.    A typical scientific investigation might go like so:

:You ''observe'' that a room appears dark, and you ponder ''why'' the room is dark.  In an attempt to find explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several different ''hypotheses''.  One hypothesis might state that the lights are turned off.  Another hunch might be that the room's lightbulb has burnt out.  Worst yet, you could be going blind.  To discover the truth, you ''experiment''.  You feel your way around the room and find a light switch and turn it on.  No light.  You ''repeat'' the experiment, flicking the switch back and forth.  Still nothing.  That means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are off, has been ''rejected''.  You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a flashlight to prove that you are indeed not blind.  In order to ''accept'' your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,  you could ''predict'' that changing the light bulb will fix the problem.  If all your predictions succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted.  In some cases, however, your predictions will not occur, in which you'll have to start over.  Perhaps the power is off.
[[Image:Ap_biology_scienceofbiology01.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|'''How Science is Done'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;A diagram that illustrates scientific investigation&lt;/small&gt;]]


Scientists first make observations that raise a particular question.  In order to explain the observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses.  This is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why an event occurred.  Experiments are then used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses until one hypothesis remains.  Using deduction, scientists use the principles of their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are confirmed.  After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been confirmed, the hypothesis then may become a theory.

'''Quick Definitions'''

:'''Observation''' - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
:'''Inference''' - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
:'''Hypotheses''' - A suggested explanation.
:'''Rejected Hypothesis''' - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
:'''Accepted Hypothesis''' - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive experimentation and makes verifiable predictions that are true.
:'''Experiment''' - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already known.
:'''Scientific Method''' - The process of scientific investigation.
:'''Theory''' - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time.  Often tested, and usually never rejected.

The scientific method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation. This involves a '''control''', or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more firmly what is and what is not true. 

A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsification. All knowledge has its relative uncertainty.

'''Theories''' are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsification. Common theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of cells. The scientific community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas than contradicts them.

== Charles Darwin ==

[[Image:Hw-darwin.jpg|left|130px]]

Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of '''evolution through natural selection'''. 

The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwin's mind through observations made on a five-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and relatedness of island life forms, and the affinity of island forms to mainland forms.

Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsified by empirical data collected by mainstream scientists.

== After Darwin ==

Since Darwin's day, scientists have amassed a more complete '''fossil record''', including '''microorganisms''' and '''chemical fossils'''. These fossils have supported and added subtleties to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of the mechanism of heredity as carried out through '''genetics''' and '''DNA''', areas unknown to Darwin. Another growing area is '''comparative anatomy''' including homology and analogy. 

Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the '''development ''' of embryos, as certain (although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history. 

The [[molecular biology]] study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.

== Challenges to Darwin ==

[[Image:Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_(1871).jpg|right|125px]]

Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conflict with the preconceived notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were different or nonexistent in earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientifically testable and fall outside the area of attention of the field of biology, or have been disproved by one or more fields of science.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Puzzles/How do you ... ?/Ten Apples and a Basket|Back to Problem]]

Solutions:

*To your first nine friends, you give them an apple each. To your tenth friend, you hand her the basket containing the apple.  She has an apple, but she also has the basket containing the apple.

* You have ten apples in a basket.  You have an eleventh apple in your hand.  You give out the one in your hand and nine of your ten from the basket, leaving one in the basket for you.

//Solutions below are only humorous and not Logical //

*Since it doesn't say there are '''only'''(Do in the real world we always use only? Surely we mean it without saying else every sentence of us will include &quot;only&quot;. Consider &quot;My name is only Ramjane&quot;.) ten apples in the basket, it's possible the basket could start out with eleven apples in it. Then when you give out ten apples to your ten friends, you still have one apple in the basket.

*You discover a horrible secret about your friend Brian, end your friendship and put his apple back in the basket
*Alternately, end Brian, and take the apple back.

*The basket is lying under an apple tree. At the right moment you shake the tree, catching a falling apple.

*Ask Brian to wait a minute for his apple. Give the first apple to the second friend, the second to the third, the third to the fourth, the fourth to the fifth, the fifth to the sixth, the sixth to the seventh, the seventh to the eighth, the eighth to the ninth and the ninth apple to Brian, the tenth man, leaving one remaining apple in the basket.

*You consider yourself as one of the friends, and so you still have the basket with an apple.

*You went back to the store and bought another apple.

*Two of your apples got frisky in the basket and had little applets

*The tenth friend was a magician so he created the eleventh apple.

*You are a kid and your tenth friend is an imaginary one.

==[[w:Matter|Matter]]==
Matter is defined as anything that has [[w:mass|mass]] (an amount of matter in an object) and occupies [[w:space#Physics|space]] (which is measured as [[w:volume|volume]]).
* Particles, from smallest to largest
*# Subatomic particles
*#* [[w:Electrons|Electrons]]
*#* [[w:Protons|Protons]]
*#* [[w:Neutrons|Neutrons]]
*# Atoms
*# Molecules
*# Macromolecules
* Origin of matter
*# [[w:Big Bang|Big Bang]], about 13.7 billion years ago
*# [[w:Hydrogen|Hydrogen]], [[w:Helium|helium]]
*# Heavier elements formed in suns, super nova
*#* Earth's matter predates formation of sun, 4.5 billion years ago
* All matter consists of atoms, which are composed of : electrons, protons, neutrons

==[[w:Atom|The atom]]==
* Example: Hydrogen
** The simplest element
** One proton (+)
** One electron in orbit (-)
* Built by adding one proton (and one electron) at a time
* Number of protons determines atomic number and number of electrons
* Neutrons
** Neutral charge
** Contribute mass
** May decay
* [[w:Oxygen|Oxygen]]
** 8 protons (mass)
** 8 electrons
** 8 neutrons (mass)

==Mass and isotopes==
* Atomic mass
** Sum of masses of protons and neutrons
** Measured in daltons or AMU (Atomic Mass Unit)
** An AMU is 1/12 the mass of Carbon-12
** proton ~1 AMU or dalton
** 6.024 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; daltons/gram
* Atoms with same atomic number belong to same element
* Isotopes
** Same atomic number but different atomic mass
** Some are radioactive
** Uses of isotopes
*** Radioactive: 3H, 14C, 32P, 35S
**** Tracers in biochemical reactions
**** Detection of molecules in recombinant DNA technology (genetic engineering)
**** Half-life: dating of rocks, fossils
*** Non-radioactive (N, C, O)
**** Diet of organisms (including fossils)
**** Biochemical tracers

==Electrons==
* Negative charge
* Held in orbit about nucleus by attraction to positively charged nucleus
* Atom may gain or lose electron, altering charge
** Cation: loses electron, positive charge
*** Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
** Anion: gains electron, negative charge
*** Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
* Determine chemical properties of atoms
** Number
** Energy level

==Chemical bonds==
* Form molecules
* Enzymes: make, break, rearrange chemical bonds in living systems
* Ionic
* Covalent
** Sharing of one or more pairs of electrons
*** Called single, double, or triple
** No net charge (as in ionic bonds)
** No free electrons
** Give rise to discrete molecules
** Hydrogen

==Chemical reactions==
* Formation and breaking of chemical bonds
* Shifting arrangement of atoms
* Reactants -&gt; products
* Reactions are influenced by:
** Temperature
** Concentration of reactants, products
** Presence of catalysts (enzymes)
* Oxidation:reduction
==[[w:Water|Water]]==
* Essential for life
* ~75% earth's surface is water
* Life evolved in water
* Solvent for many types of solutes
* High specific heat
* High polarity
**Creates a slightly negative Oxygen and a Slightly positive hydrogen
**allows formation of Hydrogen Bonds

===Hydrogen bonding===
* A type of polar interaction
* Critical for:
** Protein structure
** Enzymatic reactions
** Movement of water in plant stems
* Weak and transient
* Powerful cumulative effect
** Solubility of many compounds
** Cohesion (capillary action)
** Lower density of ice
* Formed between molecules other than water
** Protein structure
** [[w:DNA|DNA]], [[w:RNA|RNA]] structure
Water organizes nonpolar molecules
* Nonpolar molecules: no polarity (+/-) charges
* Hydrophobic: exclude water because they don't form hydrogen bonds with it
* Consequences:
** Membranes
** Protein structure
* Hydrophilic: polar substances associate with water
Ionization of water: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 
* Forms a Hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)
* Due to spontaneous breakage of covalent bond
* At 25°C, 1 liter of water contains 10-7 moles of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions: 10-7 moles/liter
pH
* A convenient way of indicating H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration
* [[w:pH|pH]] = -log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]
* For water, pH = -log[10-7] = 7
* Since for each H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water, there is one OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, pH of 7 indicates neutrality
* Logarithmic scale

Buffer
* Reservoir for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
* Maintains relatively constant pH over buffering range

* Discovery of catalytic RNA by Cech and Altman suggested that RNA might have been first self-replicating molecule
* DNA evolved as more stable type of storage molecule

Proteins:
Their building block is amino acids. The bond connecting 2 of the amino acids together are called peptide bonds.  One of these bonds makes a monopeptide, two a dipeptide, and any more than that makes a polypeptide.

==Properties of life==
# Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic units of life. 
#* prokaryote: no nucleus 
#* eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.&lt;br /&gt;
# Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.&lt;br /&gt;
# Energy Processing&lt;br /&gt;
# Growth and Development&lt;br /&gt;
# Reproduction&lt;br /&gt;
#* hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.
# Regulation, including homeostasis.&lt;br /&gt;
# Evolution.

==Origin of life: 3 hypotheses ==
 
* Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe 
** evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D &amp; L forms) 
** questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock
-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only difference would be that life did not originate on Earth. 
* Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)
-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution without evidence of an &quot;in-between stage&quot; that is credible. Many of the stages of man are disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
* Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of this.)  These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other Intelligent Designer).
** Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support. 
-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often regarded as superstitious and/or unscientific.

* It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses (and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or the other.

==The early earth==
It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago. 
* Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
* Reducing atmosphere: much free H 
** also H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 
** little, if any, free O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
** with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C 
* Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C 
* Lack of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and consequent ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) meant considerable UV energy 

Chemical reactions on early earth 
* UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic molecules 
* Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment 
** simulated early atmospheric conditions 
** found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life 
** won Nobel prize for work 
** experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible

Issues
* Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of what is currently thought to be those of early earth
* He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into replicating molecules and cells
* In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, significant issues and problems for biogenesis have been identified.  This is a weak hypothesis at this time.
* Conclusion: Life exists, we don't know why.

==Origin of cells==
Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death.  As such, fossils of the earliest cells do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life) was created on Earth.
* Bubble hypothesis 
** A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s 
* Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes 
* Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles 
** Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacervates 
* Other surfaces for evolution of life 
** deep sea thermal vents 
** ice crystals 
** clay surfaces 
** tidal pools

==The RNA world?==
* DNA &amp;rarr; RNA &amp;rarr; polypeptide (protein) 
* Catalytic RNA: ribozyme 
** discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize) 
** catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc. 
* Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life 
** consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides (ATP) 
** relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain 
==The earliest cells==
* Microfossils 
** ~3.5 by 
** resemble bacteria: prokaryotes 
** biochemical residues 
** stromatolites 
* Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea) 
** extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens 
** may not represent most ancient life 
* Eubacteria 
** cyanobacteria: photosynthesis 
* atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; limestone deposits 
* chloroplasts of eukaryotes 
Cyanobacteria

==Major steps in evolution of life==
* Prebiotic synthesis of macromolecules 
* Self replication 
** RNA? (primitive metabolism) 
* DNA as hereditary material 
* 1st cells 
* Photosynthesis 
* Aerobic respiration 
* Multicellularity (more than once)

== Biological membranes ==
[[image:bilayer.png|thumb|400px|Plasma membrane bilayer]]
Biological membranes surround cells and serve to keep the insides separated from the outsides. They are formed of [[en:lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]]s, which by definition are a double layer of [[en:Fatty acid|fatty acid]] molecules (mostly [[en:phospholipid|phospholipid]]s, lipids containing lots of phosphorus).  

[[en:Proteins|Proteins]] serve very important functions in cellular membranes. They are '''active transports''' in and out of the cell, acting as gatekeepers. They relay '''signals''' in and out of the cell. Proteins are the '''site of many enzymatic reactions''' in the cell, and play a role in '''regulation of cellular processes.'''

==Phospholipid==
Phospholipid bilayer
* basis of biological membranes and cellular organisms
* contains a charged, hydrophilic (attracted to water) head and two hydrophobic (repelled by water) hydrocarbon tails
* In presence of water, phospholipids form bilayer
** maximize hydrogen bonds between water
** creates barrier to passage of materials
** fluid mosaic model shows horizontal (common) and &quot;flip-flop&quot; (rare) movement of phospholipids

==Fluid mosaic model==
* Current model of membrane
* Phospholipid bilayer
** Phospholipids
* Move freely in lipid layer, but rarely switch layers
* Different phospholipids in each layer in different organelles
** Glycolipids
** Sterols (cholesterol in animals)
* Transmembrane proteins &quot;float&quot; in fluid lipid bilayer
** also called intrinsic, integral proteins
* Exterior (extrinsic, peripheral) proteins
==Membrane proteins==
* Transport channels
* Enzymes
* Cell surface receptors
* Cell surface identity markers
* Cell adhesion proteins
* Attachments to cytoskeleton
Integral membrane proteins
* Anchoring to membrane
** Protein has attached phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, anchors protein in outer layer (no picture)
** Protein has one or more hydrophobic transmembrane domains
* -helix
* -sheet


----
'''Channel protein
Transport across membranes'''
'''* Diffusion'''
** From higher concentration to lower concentration
** Membranes are selectively permeable
* Ions diffuse through membrane channels
** Selective
** Movement determined by diffusion and voltage differences
* '''Facilitated diffusion'''
** Carrier protein, physically binds transported molecule
*''' Osmosis'''
* Diffusion of water down concentration gradient
* In cell: various solutes (amino acids, ions, sugars, etc.)
** interact with water, e.g., hydration shells
* Water moves through aquaporin channels into cell
* Depends upon the concentration of all solutes in solution
** Hyperosmotic solution: higher concentration of solutes
** Hypoosmotic solution: lower concentration of solutes
** Isoosmotic solution: solute concentrations equal
* Water moves from hypoosmotic solution to hyperosmotic solution
Osmotic pressure
'''Bulk transport'''
* Endocytosis: energy requiring
** Phagocytosis
* Solid material, typically food
** Pinocytosis
* Primarily liquid
'''** Receptor-mediated endocytosis'''
* Pits on cell surface coated with clathrin and receptors
* Bind specific proteins
* Exocytosis
** Discharge of materials from vesicle at cell surface

==Receptor-mediated endocytosis==
Active transport
* Energy required (usually ATP)
* Highly selective
* Works against concentration gradient
* Many examples, e.g., Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump
Cotransport (coupled transport)
* Does not use ATP directly
* Molecule is transported in connection with another molecule that is moving down a concentration gradient
** Example: Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gradient is established by a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump, with higher concentration on outside of cell. Cotransport channel carries Na+ and another molecule (e.g. glucose) into cell
* May involve proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) pumps (chemiosmosis - ATP production)

with the environment 
with each other 
  


==Cell signaling ==
* Signaling requires 
** Signal 
** Cell receptor (usually on surface) 
* Signaling is important in: 
** Response to environmental stimuli 
** Sex 
** Development 
* Major area of research in biology today 
  
===Types of signaling ===
* Direct contact (e.g., gap junctions between cells) 
* Paracrine:  Diffusion of signal molecules in extracellular fluid; highly local 
* Endocrine: Signal (hormone) molecule travels through circulatory system 
* Synaptic: neurotransmitters

====Types of signal molecules ====
* Hormones: chemically diverse 
** Steroid 
** Polypeptide 
** Vitamin/amino acid derived

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GenBioTOC}}
==Energy ==
* The capacity to do work. 
** Kinetic energy: energy of motion (ex. jogging).
** Potential energy: stored energy (ex. a lion that is about to leap on its prey).
* Many forms of energy: e.g., 
** Heat 
** Sound 
** Electric current 
** Light 
** All convertible to heat 
* Most energy for biological world is from sun 
* Heat (energy of random molecular motion, thermal energy) 
** Convenient in biology 
** All other energy forms can be converted to heat 
** Thermodynamics: study of thermal energy 
* Heat typically measured in kilocalories 
** Kcal: 1000 calories 
** 1 calorie: amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree Celsius (°C) 
* Heat plays major role in biological systems 
** Ecological importance 
** Biochemical reactions

==Oxidation–Reduction==
* Energy flows into biological world from sun 
* Light energy is captured by photosynthesis 
** Light energy raises electrons to higher energy levels 
** Stored as potential energy in covalent C-H bonds of sugars 
* Strength of covalent bond is measured by amount of energy required to break it 
** 98.8 kcal/mole of C-H bonds 
* In chemical reaction, energy stored in covalent bonds may transfer to new bonds.  When this involves transfer of electrons, it is oxidation–reduction reaction 
* Always take place together 
** Electron lost by atom or molecule through oxidation is gained by another atom or molecule through reduction 
** Potential energy is transferred from one molecule to another (but never 100%) 
* Often called redox reactions 
** Photosynthesis 
** Cellular Respiration
** Chemiosynthesis
** Autotrophs
** Heterotrophs

==NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ==
* Common electron acceptor/donor in redox reactions 
* Energetic electrons often paired with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

==Free energy ==
* Energy required to break and subsequently form other chemical bonds 
** Chemical bonds: sharing of electrons, tend to hold atoms of molecule together 
** Heat, by increasing atomic motion, makes it easier to break bonds (entropy) 
* Energy available to do work in a system 
* In cells, G = H - TS
** G = Gibbs’ free energy 
** H =  H (enthalpy) energy in molecule’s chemical bonds 
** TS (T, temperature in °K; S, entropy) 
* Chemical reactions break and make bonds, producing changes in energy 
* Under constant conditions of temperature, pressure and volume, &amp;Delta;G = &amp;Delta;H - T&amp;Delta;S
* &amp;Delta;G, change in free energy 
** If positive (+), H is higher, S is lower, so there is more free energy; endergonic reaction, does not proceed spontaneously; require input of energy (e.g., heat) 
** If negative (–), H is lower, S is higher.  Product has less free energy; exergonic; spontaneous

Pee pee ===Activation energy =       == yeet dis ain't true
Mr Simmons is setting us up for failure
* Reactions with –&amp;Delta;G often require activation energy 
** e.g., burning of glucose 
** Must break existing bonds to get reaction started 
* Catalysts lower activation energy

==Enzymes ==
* Biological catalysts 
** Protein 
** RNA (ribozyme) 
* Stabilizes temporary association between reactants (substrates) to facilitate reaction 
** Correct orientation 
** Stressing bonds of substrate 
* Lower activation energy 
* Not consumed (destroyed) in reaction 
  
===Carbonic anhydrase ===
* Important enzyme of red blood cells 
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 
*  Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes 1st reaction 
** Converts water to hydroxyl 
** Orients the hydroxyl and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Enzyme mechanism ===
* One or more active sites which bind substrates (reactants) 
** Highly specific 
* Binding may alter enzyme conformation, inducing better fit

===Factors affecting enzyme activity ===
* Substrate concentration 
* Product concentration 
* Cofactor concentration 
* Temperature 
* pH 
* Inhibitors 
** Competitive: bind to active site 
** Noncompetitive: bind to 2nd site, called allosteric site; changes enzyme conformation 
* Activators 
** Bind to allosteric sites, increase enzyme activity 
  
====Cofactors ====
* Required by some enzymes 
* Positively charged metal ions 
** e.g., ions of [[en:Zinc|Zn]], Mo, Mg, Mn
** Draw electrons away from substrate (stress chemical bonds) 
* Non-protein organic molecules (coenzymes) 
** E.g., NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, etc. 
** Major role in oxidation/reduction reactions by donating or accepting electrons

==ATP ==
* Adenosine triphosphate 
* Major energy currency of cells, power endergonic reactions 
* Stores energy in phosphate bonds 
** Highly negative charges, repel each other 
* Makes these covalent bonds unstable 
** Low activation energy 
* When bonds break, energy is transferred 
* ATP &amp;rarr; ADP + Pi + 7.3 kcal/mole

==Biochemical pathways ==
* Metabolism: sum of chemical reactions in cell/organism 
* Many anabolic and catabolic reactions  occur in sequences (biochemical pathways) 
* Often highly regulated 
Evolution of biochemical pathways 
* Protobionts or 1st cells likely used energy rich substrates from environment 
* Upon depletion of a substrate, selection would favor catalyst which converts another molecule into the depleted molecule 
* By iteration, pathway evolved backward

Glucose + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ATP 
==Energy ==
* Energy is primarily in C-H bonds (C-O too) 
* Chemical energy drives metabolism 
** Autotrophs: harvest energy through photosynthesis or related process (plants, algae, some bacteria) 
** Heterotrophs: live on energy produced by autotrophs (most bacteria and protists, fungi, animals) 
* Digestion: enzymatic breakdown of polymers into monomers 
* Catabolism: enzymatic harvesting of energy 
* Respiration: harvesting of high energy electrons from glucose 
==Respiration ==
* Transfer of energy from high energy electrons of glucose to ATP 
* Energy depleted electron (with associated H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is donated to acceptor molecule 
** Aerobic respiration: oxygen accepts electrons, forms water 
** Anaerobic respiration: inorganic molecule accepts hydrogen/electron 
** Fermentation: organic molecule accepts hydrogen/electron

==Respiration of glucose ==
* C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy 
* &amp;Delta;G = -720 kcal/mole under cellular conditions 
* Largely from the 6 C-H bonds 
* Same energy whether burned or catabolized 
* In cells, some energy produces heat, most is transferred to ATP

==Alternative anaerobic respiration ==
* Methanogens (Archaebacteria). 
** CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is electron acceptor, forming CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 
* Sulfur bacteria 
** SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reduced to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S 
** Formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S set stage for evolution of photosynthesis (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as electron donor before H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) 
** About 2.7 by, based on ratio of 32S/34S, where only biological processes produce 32S enrichment

==Glycolysis overview ==
Glycolysis accounting 
* Oxidation 
** Two electrons (one proton) are transferred from each G3P to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forming NADH 
2NADH 
* Substrate level phosphorylation 
** G3P to pyruvate forms 2 ATP molecules 
 4 ATP (from 2 G3P) 
–2 ATP (priming) 
  2 ATP (net gain)

Summary: The net input of glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules which are used to split one glucose molecule.  The net yield of this step is 2 ATP and 2 pyruvate.

==Regeneration of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ==
* Reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH can deplete NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; supply; it must be regenerated 
* Two pathways, coupled to fate of pyruvate 
** With oxygen: enter electron transport chain, forming water (and ATP) 
** Without oxygen: fermentation 
* lactate 
* ethanol

==Alcohol fermentation ==

==Lactate formation ==
Either [[w:Lactate|lactic acid]] or alcohol can be formed as a result of anaerobic respiration in cells.

==Krebs cycle: overview ==
* Matrix of mitochondrion 
* Priming steps 
** Joining of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate 
** Isomerization reactions 
* Energy extraction steps in Krebs cycle 
** Per glucose 
* 6 NADH 
* 2 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
* 2 ATP (from GTP) 
* 4 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==ATP production ==
* Chemiosmosis (Mitchell) 
* H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (from NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is pumped against a gradient into the intermembranal space of the mitochondrion (creates voltage potential) 
* Diffusion back into matrix through ATP synthase channels drives synthesis of ATP (ADP + Pi &amp;rarr; ATP) 
* ATP exits mitochondrion by facilitated transport

==Evolution of aerobic respiration ==
* Preceded by evolution of photosynthesis (O2 needed; also, prior evolution of electron transport and chemiosmosis) 
* High efficiency of ATP production compared to glycolysis 
** Fostered evolution of heterotrophs 
** Fostered evolution of mitochondria by endosymbiosis in eukaryotes</text>

&lt;center&gt; '''6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/center&gt;

* One of most important reactions in history of life: 
** source of atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
** ultimately led to aerobic respiration and eukaryotes 
* Responsible for bulk of glucose production 
* Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air, not the soil 
* Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water 
* Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) continue in the dark 
* Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light) and build sugar (glucose).  
* Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions.  In light reactions, light is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.
* Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.  

==Light Reactions==
* Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
* Consists of units of energy called photons 
* Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end 
*Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
* Chlorophyll and other plant pigments differentially absorb photons 
** Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy 
** Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll 
** Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reflected back, hence the green color of plants) 

===Accessory pigments===
* Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment 
** Absorbs light with considerable efficiency (i.e., retaining energy) 
* Accessory pigments 
** Chlorophyll b 
** Carotenoinds 
* capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls 
* Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too) 
Photosynthetic steps 
* Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to electron donated by water 
* Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor 
* Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP

===The Even More Detailed Light Reactions===

'''What the Light Reactions Do:'''

The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.  During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules.  More specifically, light turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.

'''How the &quot;Chloroplast-Battery&quot; Charges ATP:'''

The '''stroma''' is the fluid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge.  This means that it contains about a &quot;gazillion&quot; extra electrons.  The solvent of stroma is water.

The fluid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen (H+) ions.  The pH here is low, making the fluid very acidic.  The solvent of thylakoid disk fluid is water.

A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a strong negative charge in two different compartments.  Energy is released when H+ ions (free protons) flow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma.  This is electrical energy, since it is a flow of charged particles.

The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane; this reaction is 'exothermic.'  The energy that is given off is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is the phosphate ion):
                     ADP + Pi --&gt; ATP

The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.  Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesn't, and since the first reaction releases energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be 'coupled' together so that the first fuels the second.  Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for this to happen.

'''Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:'''

Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk green.  The nonpolar &quot;tails&quot; of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of the thylakoid.

==“Dark” reactions==
* ATP drives endergonic reactions 
* NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to carbohydrate (C-H bonds) 
*Occur in the stroma
*First step in carbon fixation 

===The Detailed Dark Reactions===

'''What the Dark Reactions Do:'''

The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions.  The dark reactions occur in the stroma of a chloroplast.  Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they don't have to.  They'll occur in the dark until the chloroplast's supply of ATP runs out (usually about 30 seconds).

'''The Calvin Cycle:'''

The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar.  This means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of different enzymes to catalyze the reactions.

Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms are strong.  Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon atoms from the oxygen atoms.  The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.

When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as sugar), this is called carbon fixation.

It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

How cells divide
==Prokaryote cell division ==
* Binary fission 
** Doubling of cell contents, including DNA 
** Fission to divide contents 
* Segregation of replicated genomes by growth of membrane between attachment points 
* Partitioning of cytoplasmic components 
* Escherichia coli 
** Capable of cell division every 20 minutes under optimal conditions (DNA in continuous state of replication) 
** Model organism of bacterial cell division

==Bacterial DNA replication==
* Replication follows rules of base pairing, with each polynucleotide chain serving as template for synthesis of its complement. 
* Genetic evidence showed that the bacterial chromosome is circular long before there was corroborating physical evidence. 
Eukaryotic chromosomes 
* Discovered by Walther Fleming in 1882 in dividing cells of salamander larvae, following improvements in microscopes and staining technology 
** He called division mitosis (mitos = “thread”) 
* Chromosome number is constant in a species 
** Ranges from 2 to &gt;500 (46 in human somatic cells) 
** Homologous pairs, one contributed by each parent 
** Change in number is cause and consequence of speciation 
* Chromosome constancy and their precise division in mitosis and meiosis led biologists to postulate that they were carriers of hereditary information 

==Chromosome number ==
* 1N = number of chromosomes in gamete 
* 1N = haploid chromosome number 
* 2N = number of chromosomes in somatic cells (cells that are not egg or sperm) 
* 2N = diploid 
* Deviations from N or 2N are usually lethal in animals 
Chromosome numbers 

==Eukaryotic chromosomes ==
* Consist of chromatin 
** DNA and associated proteins, mainly histones 
** Nucleosomal organization 
** Euchromatin: unwound chromatin, in basic nucleosomal configuration; genes available for expression 
** Heterochromatin: highly condensed except during replication 
* Karyotype: array of chromosomes an individual possesses 
** Clinical importance (Down syndrome; cancer) 
** Evolutionary importance (speciation)

==Chromosome organization==

==Human karyotype stained by chromosome painting ==

==Chromosomes ==
* Homologous pairs 
** Inherited one from each parent 
** Identical in length and position of centromere 
** Contain identical or similar genes 
** Homologous pair = homologs 
* Morphology 
** After replication, consist of two sister chromatids attached to a centromere 

==Human chromosomes ==
* Diploid number = 2n = 46 = 23 pairs of homologs 
* Haploid number = 23 (gametes) 
* Each replicated chromosome contains 2 sister chromatids = 92 chromatids 
Cell cycle 
* Growth and division cycle of cells 
* Precisely controlled by biochemical and gene activity, except in cancer 
* Phases 
** G1: primary growth phase 
** S:  DNA replication; chromosome replication 
** G2: second growth phase; preparation for mitosis 
** M: mitosis; nuclear division 
** C: cytoplasmic division 

==Mitotic cell cycle ==
* Cells exiting the cell cycle are said to be in G0 
* Cell cycle time varies with stages of life cycle and development, with G1 the most variable 
* DNA replication occurs during S phase of the cell cycle following G1.
  - at this point the chromosomes are composed of two sister chromotids connected by a common centromere.

==Replicated human chromosomes ==

==Mitosis ==
* Nuclear division 
** equational division of replicated chromosomes 
** chromatids move to opposite poles 
* Continuous process 
** prophase 
** metaphase 
** anaphase 
** telophase 
* Driven by motors and microtubules 
* No change in chromosome number 
** N &amp;rarr; N by mitosis 
** 2N &amp;rarr; 2N by mitosis 
*  May be accompanied by cytokinesis 
Kinetochore 
Microtubules attach to kinetochores. 
Metaphase 
* Momentary alignment of chromosomes in center of cell 
Anaphase 

==Plant mitosis ==
* Similar to animal mitosis 
* New cell wall formed between cells from membrane partition 
Cell cycle control 
* Cell cycle events are regulated by protein complexes and checkpoints 
* Discovered by microinjection of proteins in to eggs, by mutational analysis and by techniques of molecular biology 
Molecular control of cell cycle: Cdk and cyclin 
* Cyclin dependent protein kinase (Cdk) 
** Phosphorylate serine/threonine of target regulatory proteins 
** Function only when bound to cyclin 
* Cyclin: short-lived proteins that bind to cdks 

==Controlling the cell cycle==
* External signals initiate cell division in multicellular organisms 
* Growth factors: extracellular regulatory signals 
** Usually soluble; bind to cell surface receptor 
** Sometimes membrane bound, requiring cell-cell contact with receptor 
** E.g., upon wound, platelets release PDGF which stimulates fibroblasts to enter cell cycle (exit G0), to heal wound 

==Cancer ==
* Unregulated cell proliferation 
* Cancer cells have numerous abnormalities 
** &gt;46 chromosomes 
** Mutations in proto-oncogenes 
* Encode proteins stimulating the cell cycle 
* May be regulated by phosphorylation 
* Often over expressed in cancer cells 
** Mutations in tumor-suppressor genes 
* Encode proteins inhibiting the cell cycle 
** Often bind to products of proto-oncogenes 
* May be regulated by phosphorylation

==Sexual==
* Exclusively eukaryotes 
* Fusion of two haploid genomes 
** Fertilization (= syngamy) 
** Forms new individuals in multicellular organisms as result of fusion of egg and sperm 
* Plants 
* Animals 
* Meiosis yields haploid genomes at some point in life cycle

==Sexual life cycle ==
Typical animal life cycle 
* Meiosis occurs in germ line cells in gonads producing haploid gametes 
* All other cells are somatic cells 
*Alternation of generations
*Sexual intercourse

==Meiosis ==
* Gives rise to genetic variation
* Reduction division: 2n to n 
* Preceded by one round of DNA (chromosome) replication 
* Two rounds of nuclear (&amp; usually cell) division 
** Meiosis I 
* Synapsis of homologs 
* Segregation of homologs 
* Reduction division, 2n to n 
** Meiosis II 
* No chromosome replication 
* Segregation of sister chromatids 
* Formation of 4 haploid (n) cells
* Two nuclear divisions, usually 2 cell divisions, only one round of replication 
* Meiosis I 
** Prophase: synapsis and crossing over 
** Metaphase 
** Anaphase: chromosome segregation 
** Telophase 
* Meiosis II (mitosis-like) 
** Prophase 
** Metaphase 
** Anaphase: sister chromosome segregation 
** Telophase

==Prophase I: synapsis ==
* Complete alignment of replicated homologs 
* Synapsis occurs throughout the entire length of a pair of homologs 
* Key to chromosome segregation 
* Synapsis, crossing over 
* Subdivided into 5 continuous stages 

==Crossing over ==
* Reciprocal, physical exchange between nonsister chromatids 
* Type of recombination; mixes maternal and paternal genes 
* Visual evidence: chiasmata

==Microtubules and anaphase I ==
* During prophase microtubules attach to kinetochores on one side of centromere 
* The metaphase checkpoint insures proper attachment 
* A phosphorylation event initiates motor activity and anaphase 

==Meiosis II ==
* Cytologically similar to mitosis 
** No preceding DNA replication 
** Chromatids segregate and move to opposite poles as chromosomes 
** 4 haploid cells produced 
* In animals, these cells differentiate into gametes 
* In plants and many other organisms, these cells divide by mitosis, followed some time later by gamete formation 

==Evolution of sex ==
* Asexual reproduction: all offspring genetically identical to parent 
* Sex: recombination destroys advantageous combinations 
* So why sex? 
** Many hypotheses 
** Effect repair of genetic damage? 
* Much pachytene repair as well as gene conversion 
* Some protists form diploid cells in response to stress 
** Recombination breaks up combinations of genes favoring parasites, thus reducing parasitism? 

==Consequences of sex ==
* Recombination: generates genetic diversity 
** Crossing over 
** Independent assortment 
* Random fertilization 
** Qualities of gamete usually do NOT reflect qualities of genes enclosed in gamete

[[en:Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin]], for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits arise.  

As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be '''[[w:DNA|DNA]]''', or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a million matches out of sequence.

However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order differently than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of a '''mutation'''. 
These changes in DNA sequences are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest difference in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the example of [[w:Sickle cell anaemia|Sickle cell anemia]] is commonly given as its origin is a difference of only one base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.

Individual sequences of DNA that encode for specific proteins are called '''genes''' and are the units of heredity. Each one has a set [[w:nucleotide|nucleotide]], and together all of the genes (and some  sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions) together make up the entire '''[[w:chromosome|chromosome]]'''

==Mendel ==
* Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
* Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes 
* Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
* Work is model of scientific method
* In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and recessive traits
* Published work in 1866, went unnoticed 
* In 1900 his scientific paper was “rediscovered” 
* Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics 
** still used alphabet letters to designate genes 
** still refer to dominant and recessive genes 
** still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis 
** principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results were immediately applied to humans in 1900
==Mendel’s experiments ==
* 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum 
* 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found 
* 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society 
* Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because the species did not undergo true fertilization
* discrete traits in Pisum sativum
** pure-breeding lines
** dominant/recessive alleles
* alleles are two alternate versions of a gene
** gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
** homozygous has two of the same allele
** heterozygous has two different alleles
* reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3 
* counted offspring, noted ratios 
* inferred genotypes from phenotypes 
* tested hypotheses with testcrosses 
* attempted to repeat with another species

== Mendel’s seven pairs of traits ==
# Seed form (round or wrinkled)
# Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
# Seed coat color (white or colored)
# Pod form (inflated or constricted)
# Pod color (green or yellow)
# Flower position (axial or terminal)
# Plant heights (tall or short)

==Locus ==
*The location of a specific gene within a chromosome

==Modern Y chromosome ==
Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chromosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and results in normal female. This type of female's frequency is 1/250000.

==Chromosome phenomena ==
* X-chromosome inactivation 
** Barr bodies 
* Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis 
** Results in 2N ± 1 chromosome number 
* Trisomy 2N + 1 
** Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception 
* Monosomy 2N ** 1 
** Lethal except XO 
** Usually maternal origin in humans 
==X-chromosome inactivation==
In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched off forming a Barr body.

==Barr body ==
Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.

==Human genetic disorders==

'''Down's Syndrome(Mongolism)'''

Down's Syndrome is usually produced  by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suffering from this type of syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex chromosome but an autosome.
      
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur
in children born by women in their forties. The affected
children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation 
and have a shorter life expectancy. Their most prominent
feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, 
the term mongolism.

'''Klinefelter's Syndrome'''

When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing 
egg, the resulting condition is called Klinefelter's 
Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals 
having the syndrome show the following characteristics:
*    testes are small
*    sperms are never produced
*    breasts are enlarged
*    body hair is sparse
*    individuals are mentally defective
     
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in
females. They produce eggs with XX or no sex chromosomes.
Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not 
develop (YO). This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause 
death to the offspring.</text>

==DNA ==
DNA stands for ''Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid''. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)

When someone says DNA, they may be referring to one's genetic material on multiple levels: They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double helix, a section of a chromosome, or one's entire hereditary composition.

* antiparallel
* Double helix 
** Semiconservative replication 
** Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide

==Historical perspective ==
* Mitosis and meiosis 
** Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary information 
** Bridges/Morgan, using Drosophila melanogaster showed that genes are on chromosomes (1910s) 
* Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s) 
* Griffith: transformation of bacteria (1928) 
* Avery, MacLeod, McCarty:  transforming substance is DNA (1944) 
* Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952) 
* Rosalind Franklin
* Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)

==Hershey-Chase Experiment ==
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.  Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.  They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.  With the bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria was radioactive.  In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria was radioactive, not the DNA.  This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed on in viruses.

==DNA/RNA components ==
* Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869 
===Structure of DNA===
DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides.  The &quot;backbone&quot; of the double helix is composed of phosphates connected to a five carbon sugar called ''deoxyribose'', . The &quot;rungs&quot; are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain  Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

==Chemical structure of DNA ==
* Polynucleotide 
** Phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides 
** 5’-pGpTpCpGpTpApApTp-OH 3’

==DNA replication==
* Conservative model 
** One double helix of both old strands 
** One double helix of two new strands 
* Dispersed 
** Each strand mixture of old new 
* Semiconservative 
** Meselson-Stahl experiment confirmed its viability over the previous two
*** grew ''E. coli'' bacterium in a culture containing 15N (a heavy isotope of nitrogen)
*** bacterium assimilated the 15N into their DNA
*** a similar process was then done using 14N, a lighter isotope
*** following centrifugation, the densities were observed to be that of combined in the middle, and 14N on top, thereby confirming the semiconservative model

==DNA replication ==

** Lagging strand: discontinuous replication 
*** contains multiple Okazaki fragments
* Joined by DNA ligase

==DNA replication fork==

* Beadle and Tatum 
** One gene one enzyme 
** Genetic and biochemical analysis in Neurospora 
* Today:  gene is sequence of nucleotides encoding functional RNA molecule or the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Pembentukan Kata ''(Word Forming)'' ===

In Indonesian, you can form a new word from an existing word. For example, in English, you form the word ''organize'' from the word ''organ''. Further, you can add ''-ization'' suffix on it and thus ''organization''. This example pretty much illustrates how Indonesian words are formed. Certainly, this formation is not necessarily the same and it's far richer than that. You'll learn shortly why.

The word formation is very attached to Indonesian / Malay culture. Some of the formations may not make sense to the westerners. However, with some stretch of imagination, you should be able to cope with it. Many Asian language speakers, on the other hand, will find it very intuitive and much more structured than, say, Chinese.

Using these formations, you just need to memorize one type of word (either the noun form, the verb form, or the adjective form). You can then ''nounize'' the verb or ''verbize'' the noun or form other interesting words.

In a sense, the word formation is the irregular side of Indonesian since you must know which word works with which affixes. This can be confusing for beginners. However, even if you use the incorrect affixes, as long as it doesn't lead to preexisting meaning, sympathetic speakers would understand.

=== Susunan Aktif / Pasif ''(Active / Passive Formation)'' ===
* [[Indonesian/prefix me|Awalan me-]] ''Prefix me-''
* [[Indonesian/affix me kan and me i|Imbuhan me-kan dan me-i]] ''Affix me-kan and me-i''

* [[Indonesian/prefix di|Awalan di-]] ''Prefix di-''
* [[Indonesian/affix di kan and di i|Imbuhan di-kan dan di-i]] ''Affix di-kan and di-i''
* [[Indonesian/prefix ter|Awalan ter-]] ''Prefix ter-''
* [[Indonesian/affix ter kan and ter i|Imbuhan ter-kan dan ter-i]] ''Affix ter-kan and ter-i''

== Awalan me- ''(Prefix me-)'' ==

Prefix ''me-'' is used '''to form active verbs'''. You may combine any nouns, any adjective, numbers, and even verbs themselves to form another verb.

Prefixing any words with ''me-'' would require a minor spelling change (inflection) in order to facilitate a smooth transition in pronunciation. The inflection is based solely on the first letter of the original word. This is an example of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_mutation consonant mutation]. See the table below.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''First letter''
! ''Inflection''
! ''Example''
|-
| vowels, g, h || ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''meng-''
| uji &amp;rarr; menguji (= to test), garuk &amp;rarr; menggaruk (= to scratch), hitung &amp;rarr; menghitung (= to count)
|-
| b, f, v || ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''mem-''
| beri &amp;rarr; memberi (= to give), fitnah &amp;rarr; memfitnah (= to falsely accuse)
|-
| c, d, j || ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''men-''
| cari &amp;rarr; mencari (= to search), dapat &amp;rarr; mendapat (= to obtain), jangkau &amp;rarr; menjangkau (= to reach)
|-
| k
| ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''meng-'', drops the ''k''
| kandung &amp;rarr; mengandung (= to contain or to be pregnant [if applied to a person])
|-
| p
| ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''mem-'', drops the ''p''
| putih &amp;rarr; memutih (= to turn white)
|-
| s
| ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''meny-'', drops the ''s''
| satu &amp;rarr; menyatu (= to become one / to unite)
|-
| t
| ''me-'' &amp;rarr; ''men-'', drops the ''t''
| tulis &amp;rarr; menulis (= to write)
|}

Note:
* Since original Indonesian words have no ''q'', ''x'', and ''z'', the inflection is adapted from the existing ones. The ''q'' and ''x'' words would follow ''g'' rules, ''z'' words would follow ''j'' words.
* Other initial letters (l, m, n, r, w, and y) don't have spelling changes.
* If the word is monosyllabic (only has one syllable), regardless of the first letter of the word, the ''me-'' always turns into ''menge-'', then add the word. For example: ''cat'' (= paint) &amp;rarr; ''mengecat'' (= to paint), ''bor'' (= boring tool / drill) &amp;rarr; ''mengebor'' (= to make a hole with drill).

== Me- + Kata Kerja ''(Me- + Verb)'' ==

Verbs can be combined with ''me-'' prefix. The meaning is exactly the same as the infinitive. The semantics may be different depending on the type of verbs. To refresh our mind -- there are two kinds of verbs in Indonesian:
* Transitive verbs (verbs that can have objects)
* Intransitive verbs (verbs that cannot have objects, [almost] equivalent to reflexive verbs)

=== Me- + Kata Kerja Transitif ''(Me- + Transitive Verbs)'' ===

Transitive verbs can not be used in a sentence in their infinitive forms, except for a few words (e.g. ''makan'' (= to eat), ''minum'' (= to drink)). So, in order to use it, you must conjugate it with ''me-'' or some other prefixes.

Example:
* Saya memakan roti ''(= I eat [a slice of] bread)''
* Dia menulis buku ''(= He/she writes [a] book(s))''

=== Me- + Kata Kerja Intransitif ''(Me- + Intransitive Verbs)'' ===

Unlike transitive verbs, only a few of intransitive verbs can be conjugated with ''me-''. Example:
* Dia menangis ''(= He/she cries)''

Most intransitive verbs must be used in their infinitive forms (e.g. ''tidur'' (= to sleep)) or use other affixes.

Note that, the sense of transitivity is not the same with other languages like Spanish. Here the word ''tari'' (= to dance) is considered intransitive.
* Wati menari ''(= Wati dances)''

== Me- + Kata Benda ''(Me- + Noun)'' ==

When ''me-'' prefix is combined with a noun, the new word could mean one of the following:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To put the noun on some other noun&lt;br&gt;
cat (= paint) &amp;rarr; mengecat (= to paint)&lt;br&gt;
e.g. Bapak mengecat tembok (= Father paint the wall).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To indicate that the subject turns into the noun (most of the times, figuratively)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;batu (= stone) &amp;rarr; membatu (= to turn to stone)&lt;br&gt;
e.g. Dia membatu (= He/she turns to stone [figuratively, to indicate that he/she doesn't move for hours])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kuping (= ear) &amp;rarr; menguping (= to turn to ear [i.e. to eavesdrop])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To produce the noun&lt;br&gt;
sambal (= chili) &amp;rarr; menyambal (= to make chili)&lt;br&gt;
Comment: Indonesian rarely use this notion, but Malay do. Indonesian people usually prefer the phrase ''&quot;membuat sambal&quot;'' instead.
&lt;li&gt;To do work with the noun&lt;br&gt;
bajak (= plow) &amp;rarr; membajak (= to plow)&lt;br&gt;
Note: ''Membajak'' can also mean ''to hijack''.
&lt;/ul&gt;

Note: The trickiest part of ''me-'' is when it is being combined with noun. Not all nouns can be combined with ''me-'' and the meaning is highly dependant on the culture.

== Me- + Kata Sifat ''(Me- + Adjective)'' ==

When combined with adjective, the ''me-'' prefix indicates the subject changes more into or to turn to the indicated adjective. For example:

* Besar (= big) &amp;rarr; membesar (= to become bigger)
* Kecil (= small) &amp;rarr; mengecil (= to become smaller)
* Panas (= hot) &amp;rarr; memanas (= to become hotter)
* Panjang (= long) &amp;rarr; memanjang (= to become longer)
* Putih (= white) &amp;rarr; memutih (= to turn white)
* Kuning (= yellow) &amp;rarr; menguning (= to turn yellow)

Note: Adjective that describes emotions cannot be combined with ''me-''.

== Me- + Kata Bilangan ''(Me- + Numbers)'' ==

The only numbers that can be conjugated with ''me-'' are ''satu'' (= one) and ''dua'' (= two).

* Satu &amp;rarr; menyatu (= to unite)
* Dua &amp;rarr; mendua (= to split into two)&lt;br&gt;Perhatiannya mendua (= His attention is split into two [i.e. not focused])&lt;br&gt;Hatinya mendua (= His heart is split into two [i.e. not loyal])

== Me- + Kata Tempat ''(Me- + Places)'' ==

When combined with places, ''me-'' would indicate that the subject is going to the said place.

* Udara (= air) &amp;rarr; mengudara (= to go to the air [for radio/tv program or airplane])
* Laut (= sea) &amp;rarr; melaut (= to go to the sea [for ships/sailors])
* Darat (= ground/land) &amp;rarr; mendarat (= to land [for ships/airplane])
* Seberang (= across) &amp;rarr; menyeberang (= to cross [the street, sea, river])

== Me- + Kata Seru ''(Me- + Expletive)'' ==

Note that the ''expletives'' doesn't mean ''swear words'' here, but rather the words that mimic sounds. For example: &quot;Moo&quot;, &quot;Baa&quot;, &quot;Quack&quot;, etc.

When expletives are combined with ''me-'', it indicates that the subject produces the indicated sound.

* Aum (= tiger roar) &amp;rarr; mengaum (= to roar like tigers)
* Lenguh (= moo) &amp;rarr; melenguh (= to moo like cows)

      <text xml:space="preserve">You are already familiar with writing a number down, and having it mean a certain combination of tens, hundreds, and so on. This is one form of '''number representation''', but there are others. We will look at number bases and continued fractions.




== Number bases==
You are already familiar with base-10 number representation. For example, the number 2818 is the same as
: 2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+8&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+8&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

We can replace the number 10 here with any number and we obtain a different number. In general, we can represent an integer ''n'' in a base ''b'' by the following:
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt;+...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
where the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are all less than ''b''.

We write a number base ''b'' as (''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt;...''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, if we have the numeral 243 in base 6, we write it (243)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. When we are in base 10 we simply write the number: for example the numeral 155 in base 10 is simply written 155.

However, given a number in a base ''b'', how can we convert it to our natural base 10 system? Likewise, how can we convert a number from our base 10 system to base ''b''?

The first is relatively easy, the other more difficult.

=== Converting base ''b'' to base 10 ===
We simply use the definition of a base-''b'' number to convert a base-''b'' number to base 10 - that is we simply multiply out.

For example
:(919)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;=9&amp;times;12&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+12&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+9=1317.

=== Converting base 10 to base ''b''===
This task however is slightly more difficult, and there are several ways of performing this task.

One method is to write each step using the division algorithm from the [[../Number theory/]] section. For example, if we wish to convert 1317 to base 12:
: 1317 = 12 &amp;times; 109 + 9
: 109  = 12 &amp;times; 9 + 1
: 9    = 12 &amp;times; 0 + 9


So in base 12, (919)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;=1317.

== Real numbers ==
We've just seen how we can convert ''integers'' from base to base, but how do we work with converting ''real'' numbers?

Recall in base 10 we write a number such as 11.341 as
: 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;+4&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;+1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

and so we can extend our definition above of a base-''b'' number to be
:
''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt;+...+''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+''a''&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;+...

where the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are all less than ''b'', and the sum could terminate or go on indefinitely.

Again, how are we to convert these numbers from base to base? We can convert the integral part, but what about the ''fractional part'' (the part less than 1)?

=== Converting fractional ''n'' to base-''b''===
Say we wish to convert .341 in base 10 to base 6.

We write a table, using the following rules
:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \lfloor{6\gamma_{i-1}}\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_i = 6\gamma_{i-1}-c_i&lt;/math&gt;

 ''i''      ''c''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;                   &amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;                6&amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
 0      0                   .341                2.046
 1      2                   .046                0.276
 2      0                   .276                1.656
 3      1                   .656                3.936
 4      3                   .936                5.616
 5      5                   .616                3.696
 6      3                   .696                4.176
 7      4                   .176                1.056
 8      1                   .056                0.336
 9      0                   .336                2.016

It looks like this expansion will go on forever! We need to calculate for further values of i to see whether we hit a repeat value of &amp;gamma;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to see whether we get a repetition.

So we have the approximation that .341 is near to (.20135341)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. (''Calculate this using the definition. How close is our approximation?'')

&lt;!-- note to self: provide an example of a repeater --&gt;

If we obtain a base-''b'' representation for example, that looks something like (.18191819181918191819...)&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; we call the representation ''periodic''. We often write this as
: &lt;math&gt;(.\overline{1819})_b&lt;/math&gt;

We use this same procedure to convert a fractional number to base-''b'' by replacing the 6 above with ''b''.

== Converting fractional ''n'' to base 10==
We have a nifty trick we can use to convert a fractional ''n'' in base-''b'' to base 10 provided the representation repeats. Let us look at an example:

Consider &lt;math&gt;(.\overline{3145})_7=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
Now then
: &lt;math&gt;(3145.\overline{3145})_7 = 7^4\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
And now
: &lt;math&gt;(3145)_7+(.\overline{3145})_7=7^4\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
which is
: &lt;math&gt;(3145)_7+\alpha=7^4\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
Then
: &lt;math&gt;(3145)_7=7^4\alpha - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(3145)_7=(7^4-1)\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
And finally
: &lt;math&gt;{(3145)_7 \over 7^4-1}=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
On converting (3145)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; to base 10, we obtain the following
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1111/2400&lt;/math&gt;

== Continued fractions==
In a sense, the base-''b'' representation is nice, but it has a few shortcomings in respect to accuracy. We cannot reliably represent the number &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; using base-''b'' representation. This is where the ''continued fraction'' representation comes in handy, which has some nice properties regarding quadratic irrationals.

A ''continued fraction'' is a number in the form
:&lt;math&gt; q_0 + {1 \over q_1 + {1 \over q_2 + {1 \over q_3+\ldots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this notation is clearly rather cumbersome, we abbreviate the above to
:&lt;math&gt;[q_0; q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots]&lt;/math&gt;

Again we ask ourselves how can we convert from and to this number representation? Again converting from is simpler than converting to.

=== Converting from continued fraction representation ===
We simply use our definition of the continued fraction to convert from a continued fraction. This may look difficult, but in fact is quite simple depending on which end one starts with. Let's look at an example

Consider
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=[3; 1, 2, 5]&lt;/math&gt;
Now, we work from right to left. We first have the fraction 
:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over 5}&lt;/math&gt;
The next digit 2 tells us to perform
:&lt;math&gt;2+{1\over 5}=11/5&lt;/math&gt;
and then take the reciprocal to get
:&lt;math&gt;{5 \over 11}&lt;/math&gt;
Now the next digit 1 tells us to perform
:&lt;math&gt;1+{5 \over 11}={16 \over 11}&lt;/math&gt;
and then to take the reciprocal to get
:&lt;math&gt;{11 \over 16}&lt;/math&gt;
Now we must add ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; which is always greater than 1 and we get the result:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha={59 \over 16}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Converting to continued fraction representation===
Again, we draw up a table.

Consider the fraction 12/22, and use the following rules in the table
&lt;!-- : &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''q''&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- previous not only wasn't using math mode — and thus wasn't very readable — it looks like the power was missing from the first term; the results didn't match the table. --&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i = \theta_{i-1}^{-1} - q_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;q_i = \lfloor \theta_i^{-1} \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
 i   &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;      &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;     q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
 0   12/22   .       0
 1   12/22   22/12   1
 2   5/6     6/5     1
 3   1/5     5/1     5

(stop since next row will be full of 0s)

So now the continued fraction for 12/22 is [0; 1, 1, 5].

=== Converting a periodic continued fraction to quadratic irrational===
Firstly, we make note of a nice property of periodic continued fractions (where the sequence of ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; repeat), that 
: every periodic continued fraction is a number in the form 
:: &lt;math&gt;{a \pm \sqrt{b} \over c}\ \mathrm{for}\ a, b, c \in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the continued fraction 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\alpha &amp; = &amp; [2; 2, 1, 2, 2, 1 ...] \\
       &amp; = &amp; [2; \overline{2, 1, 2}]\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now
:&lt;math&gt;[2; \overline{2, 1, 2}]=[2; 2, 1, \overline{2, 2, 1}]&lt;/math&gt;
which we can rewrite as
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+{1 \over {2 + {1 \over {1 + {1\over \alpha}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Now we can simplify to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+{1 \over {2 + {1 \over {\alpha+1 \over \alpha}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+{1 \over {2 + {\alpha \over \alpha+1}}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+{1 \over {3\alpha+2 \over \alpha+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=2+{\alpha+1 \over 3\alpha+2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha={7\alpha+5 \over 3\alpha+2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha{(3\alpha+2)}={7 \alpha+5}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha{(3\alpha+2)}-5=7 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3\alpha^2+2\alpha-5=7 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3\alpha^2+2\alpha-7 \alpha-5=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;3\alpha^2-5 \alpha-5=0&lt;/math&gt;
which is a quadratic equation and can be solved to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha={\frac{5 + {\sqrt{85}}}{6}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that we can always roll up the continued fraction into the form (a&amp;alpha;+b)/(c&amp;alpha;+d)=&amp;alpha;, which demonstrates the point that every quadratic irrational has a repeating continued fraction representation

=== Convergents ===
Say we have a continued fraction [''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ] which represents a number ''n''. Let us examine the following series of fractions [''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;], [''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;], [''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and so on. Each element of the series is known as a ''convergent''. It turns out that the series of convergents provide the best rational approximations to ''n''.

These can be calculated from the continued fraction representation, but also from the calculation table. Let us take &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

Continue as before, but place an extra -1 row, and set u&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;=1, v&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;=0. Iterate with the rules
:&lt;math&gt;u_{i+1}=q_{i+1}u_i+v_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_{i+1}=q_{i+1}v_i+v_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
i   &amp; \theta_i      &amp; \theta_i^{-1} &amp; q_i &amp; u_i &amp; v_i\\
-1  &amp;               &amp;               &amp;     &amp; 1   &amp; 0 \\   
0   &amp; \sqrt{6}      &amp;               &amp; 2   &amp; 2   &amp; 1 \\
1   &amp; 2-\sqrt{6}    &amp; 1+\sqrt{3/2}  &amp; 2   &amp; 5   &amp; 2 \\
2   &amp; -1+\sqrt{3/2} &amp; 2+\sqrt{6}    &amp; 4   &amp; 22  &amp; 9 \\
3   &amp; -2+\sqrt{6}   &amp; 1+\sqrt{3/2}  &amp; 2   &amp; 49  &amp; 20 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and the sequence repeats and the continued fraction is [2; 2, 4, 2, 4, ... ]. We can continue the process to generate more convergents - the convergents are 2, 5/2, 22/9, 49/20, ...

A mutation is a permanent change to an organism's genetic material ([[w:DNA|DNA]] or RNA).  Mutations are a rare but significant biological process, since they provide the variation on which [[General Biology/Evolution|evolution]] acts and are also the source of cancer.

An organism's genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four different [[w:nucleotide|nucleotides]], like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters.  A mutation event is when the order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.

Mutations come in a number of forms:
==Point Mutations==
Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide.  These come in the form of substitutions, insertions and deletions:

==Substitution==
Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing the codon. The altered codon codes for a different amino acid substitution.The substitution mutations are of two types:


1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another purine(A by G or G by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)

2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine  or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

===Insertion===

===Deletion===

==Larger mutations==
Larger mutations which involve more than one nucleotide also include insertions and deletions, but can also include inversions, rearrangement of nucleotides and duplication of entire genes:

===Inversion===

===Rearrangement===

===Gene/Exon Duplications===

====Transposition====

====Retrotransposition====

==Chromosomal mutations==
Chromosomal mutations involve changes to entire chromosomes.  These mutations are particularly rare:

===Translocation===

===Fusion===

===Fission===

===Segmental Duplication===

===Chromosomal Duplication===

===Genome Duplication===

== Causes of mutations ==

== Effects of mutations ==
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.  Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.

Mutations can be classified by their effects:

===Silent Mutation===

Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid chain.

===Frameshift===

===Missense Mutation===

Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

===Nonsense Mutation===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GenBioTOC}}There are lots of ways to classify living things but the most important is cells, domains, kingdoms, species, and binomial nomenclature. These are all the things that you need to know to be able to classify living things.

=== Classification of Living Things &amp; Naming ===

In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called '''taxonomy''' (Taxis means arrangement and nomos means method). The modern taxonomic system was developed by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical characteristics of organisms to identify and differentiate between different species, and is based around genetics.  
  
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish different levels of similarity, each classifying group, called '''taxon''' (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups. To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical order: 
*Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote 
*Kingdom - Plantae, Animalia, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria 
*Phylum 
*Class
*Order 
*Family 
*Genus 
*Species - smallest classification

  
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most specific category available. The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would be classified as follows: 
  
Eukaryote --&gt; Animal --&gt; Chordata --&gt; Mammalia --&gt; Lagomorpha --&gt; Leporidae --&gt; Lepus --&gt; ''Lepus europaeus''. 
  
'''Binomial nomenclature''' is used to name an organism, where the first word beginning with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientific name can be also abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its first letter followed by a period. In our example, ''Lepus europaeus'' would become ''L. europaeus''. 
  
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both specific methods of classifying an organism. They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is quite different from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between crayfish and catfish, where one might believe that they both are fish when in fact, they are quite different.

Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement with published rules. To study for a test these are the best words to know 
taxonomist, biologist, chemist, geologist, unicellular, multi- cellular, bilateral symmetry, radial symmetry, chlorophyll, photosynthesis, respiration, reproduction, vertebrates, endoskeleton, exoskeleton, consumers, decomposers, heterotroph, autotroph, vascular, non-vascular. These are all part of classifying things.

=== Eukaryotes &amp; Prokaryotes ===

Recall that there are two basic types of cells: '''eukaryotes''' and '''prokaryotes'''. 

Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles. Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:

*Large (100 - 1000 μm)
*DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
*Genome consists of several chromosomes.
*Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
*Mitochondria and other organelles present
*Most forms are multicellular

Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:

*Small (1-10 μm)
*DNA circular, unbounded
*Genome consists of single chromosome.
*Asexual reproduction common, by mitosis.
*No general organelles
*Most forms are singular

=== The Three Domains ===

The three domains are organized based on the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Today's living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and different from eukaryotes. This fact has been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology. The three domains are as follows: 

'''Archea (Archeabacteria)''' consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.

'''Eubacteria''' consists of more typical bacteria found in everyday life. The kingdom Eubacteria belongs to this domain.

'''Eukaryote''' encompasses most of the world's visible living things. The kingdoms Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.

=== The Six Kingdoms ===

Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The first two, '''Plants''' and '''Animals''', are commonly understood and will not be expounded here. 

'''Protista''', the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in 1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit properties of both animals and plants. 

'''Fungi''' are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.

'''Eubacteria''' are bacteria, made up of small cells, which differ in appearance from the organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell walls made of peptidoglycan. 

'''Archae (or Archaebacteria)''' are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not found in any other organism)which differ them from other bacteria and which allow them to live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.
&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

=== Origins of Diversity ===

The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was first described by British naturalist Charles Darwin as '''natural selection'''. 

For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an immense potential of genetic variety.

One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry, DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is used:

*Anatomy:

Although a horse and a human may look different, there is evidence that their arm structures are quite similar. Their arms' sizes and proportions may be different, but the anatomical structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in different taxa may not be that different. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as '''homologous'''.

*Development

*Biochemistry: 

Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry led them to be in their taxon of their own.

=== Phylogeny, Cladistics &amp; Cladogram ===

Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses' of the evolutionary history of organisms, known as '''phylogeny'''. As with the Scientific Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny. 

'''Cladistics''' is a classification system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny, cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique characteristics. Such characteristics are known as '''derived characteristics'''

The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a '''cladogram''', a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animal's phylogeny. In order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species are matched and analysed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

'''Viruses''' are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However, they are not biological organisms so they are not classified in any kingdom of living things. They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a '''capsid'''. Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are completely inert.

Since first being identified in 1935, viruses have been classified into more than 160 major groups. Viruses are classified based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classified into 21 groups. 

Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called '''bacteriophages'''.

==Viral Replication==

As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles. 

In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a specific receptor site on the plasma membrane of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which fit exactly into a matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope. 

There are two forms of viral replication: the '''lytic cycle''' and the '''lysogenic cycle'''. 

===Lytic Cycle===

# Attachment: The virus binds to specific receptors on the host cell.
# Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.
# Replication: The virus's nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the virus's DNA or RNA.
# Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
# Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus particles are now released.

===Lysogenic Cycle===

# Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
# Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
# Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cell's chromosome. When integrated in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cell's chromosome is known as a '''prophage'''.
# Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions, daughter cells, contain original father cell's chromosome embedded with a prophage.
# Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can switch to the lytic cycle.  

The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly different. A notable example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus. 

====Retrovirus reproductive cycle====

# The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See above).
# In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA. 
# Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the first. With these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created. 
# DNA is then incorporated into the host cell's chromosomes. Similar to the concept of a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a '''provirus'''. However, the provirus never leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage. 
# The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.

==Viral Genome==

The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and configuration vary. The entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments. Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or circular.

Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only making a few different proteins for the viruses' capsid. On the other hand, the human genome codes for over 30,000 different proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves. Such viruses are called '''replication defective'''.

Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.

==Viruses Practice Questions==

# As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.
# Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they will reappear many times during the course of a person's life. Which cycle would the herpes simplex virus undergo?
# Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suffer from shingles, an altered form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have undergone?
# Would an antibiotic work for a person suffering from a cold of flu? Explain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.

==Classification of Protists==

There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.

1. '''Protozoa''' (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food and helps.

2. '''Algae''' (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.

3. '''Slime moulds''' and '''water moulds''' (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like protozoa.

==Protozoa==

As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms, like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.

Protozoa are generally difficult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a flattened leaf.  Tiny blood parasites may be only 2 μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter. 

Furthermore, different protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has led certain organisms to be mistakenly classified for other species. 

Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classified based on their methods of locomotion.

&lt;u&gt;Characteristics of Protozoa :&lt;/u&gt;

*About 30,000 species known 

*About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases

*heterotrophic

*highly variable in form and life cycle

*mostly unicellular

*range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm

*lack cell walls

they love environment and each other..............

==Algae==

Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classified as plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem, and phloem (though some plants, such as mosses, also lack all of these parts). Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can differ in size and shape as well.

There are six phyla of algae:''' chlorophytes (green algae)''', '''phaeophytes (brown algae)''', '''rhodophytes (red algae)''', '''chrysophytes (diatoms)''', '''pyrrophytes (dinoflagellates)''', and '''euglenophytes (euglenoids)'''. 

===Chlorophytes===

Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most chlorophytes use flagellae for some locomotion.

===Phaeophytes===

Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds. They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin). The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out when exposed to air at low tide. 

Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, flat fronds (a large leaf) which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in areas of cold water. 

===Rhodophytes===

Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to resist drying. 

===Chryosophytes===

Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one of the biggest components of plankton, a free-floating collection of microorganisms, eggs, and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a significant amount of atmospheric oxygen.

The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must fit inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.

===Pyrrophytes===

Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats composed of stiff cellulose. They are more easily identifiable, due to the presence of two flagellae. The longer flagellae propels the dinoflagellate, while the second shorter, flatter flagellae functions as a rudder.

Some species of pyrrophytes are '''zooxanthellae'''. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning the favour of sheltering them, dinoflagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.

A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoflagellates reproduce rapidly to form a '''harmful algal bloom (HAB)''', known as a red tide if dinoflagellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife, and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.

===Euglenophytes===

Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two flagella. They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive structure called an '''eyespot'''.

==Slime molds &amp; Water molds==

There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.

===Oomycotes (Water moulds)===

Oomycotes are filamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.  Oomycotes differ from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.

===Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)===

Myxomycoties are visible to the naked eye as tiny slug-like organisms which creep over decayed and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a '''plasmodium'''. 

===Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive cycle===

Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in unfavourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a '''pseudoplasmodium'''.

====Reproductive Cycle:====

1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.

2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium. 

3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.

4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated. 

5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals or the wind.

6. Cycle repeats.

==Protists Practice Questions==

1. Which of the following adjectives describe the major food source of protozoa?
 
:a) chemoautotrophic
:b) photoheterotrophic
:c) chemoheterotrophic
:d) heterotrophic
:e) A, C, D
:f) C, D


2. The protozoan ''Giardia lamblia'' can inhabit a human body's intestinal tract and cause gastroenteritis.

a) Give the abbreviated binomial name of this protozoan.

b) Would the relationship between this protozoan and human being be mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic?

3. Found in many products, such as Petri dishes, agar is made from mucilagnious material in seaweed. Of the six phyla of algae, which phyllum/phyla would agar be made from?

4. Which of the following adjectives describe the major food source of Euglenophytes without an eyespot?

:a) photoautotrophic
:b) photoheterotrophic
:c) chemoautotrophic
:d) chemoheterotrophic
:e) B or C
:f) C or D

5. Can coral reefs exist in nutrient-poor areas? Explain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals. Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms (a type of fungi) are eaten by us.
A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi are multicellular. Their bodies are composed of '''hyphae''', a network of fine filaments. In a mushroom, the hyphae are densely packed so it is difficult to see the individual structures when a mushroom is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus. The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a '''mycelium'''. 

In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa are porous, allowing cytoplasm to flow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a hard material called '''chitin'''. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large, branching, multinucleate cells.

==Nutrition==

Fungi are '''saprophytes'''. When they find a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) , they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diffuse into the fungus, where they are used to allow growth and repair. 

Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athlete's foot grows on the human foot.  These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called '''haustoria''', which can penetrate host cells without immediately killing them. 

However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this relationship, known as a '''mycorrhiza''', there are many benefits:

*Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.

*The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the plant roots.

*The fungal cells help to maintain air and water flow in the soil around the roots. 

*The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.

==Fungal Reproduction==

Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through '''fragmentation'''. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken off, which then grow into new mycelia.

The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers. Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the four phylla of fungi.

==Types of Fungi==

===Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)===

This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.

1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as '''mating strain +''' and '''mating strain -''', combine and fuse together.

2. '''Plasmogamy''', the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation of a heterokaryotic (n + n) '''zygosporangium or zygospore'''. Note that the zygospore is NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.

3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.

4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes '''karyogamy''' (n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce diploid zygosporangia. 

5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.

6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.

7. Back to step #1.

===Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)===

This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes. 

1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as '''mating strain +''' and '''mating strain -''', combine and fuse together.

2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.

3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which develop into '''basidiocarps''', short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom. 

4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called '''basidia''', which then undergo karyogamy. 

5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid '''basidiospores''', a term referring to a basidiomycete's spores. 

6. Still remaining on the basidiocarp, the haploid basidiospores eject, fall from the basidiocarp, and are dispersed by the wind when mature.

7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived haploid mycelia.

8. Back to Step #1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Standards==
This book is intended to cover science as taught in schools to 14 - 16 year old pupils. It is called GCSE science because the first draft is intended to cover the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) standard as taught in schools in the UK, but generally in Scotland. Having said that if you are not in the UK and wish to include material to bring it up to another ''similar'' standard feel free to do so. (Note: It would be appreciated if you could use the ''British'' way of spelling words (e.g. colo'''u'''r)!

==Additional resources==
There will be teacher notes added in time with worksheets, experiments and additional questions. There will also be a study help desk set up so that students can ask questions.

==Contributing to this book==
If you spot any errors in the texts, just go ahead and edit them out (click the link that says edit this page and start typing). If you wish to help writing any of the modules, either click on any red module and start typing, or if you need help drop me a line on my talk page [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">In networking, a communications protocol or network protocol is the specification of a set of rules for a particular type of communication. 

Different protocols often describe different aspects of a single communication; taken together, these form a protocol stack. The terms &quot;protocol&quot; and &quot;protocol stack&quot; also refer to the software that implements a protocol. 

Most recent protocols are assigned by the IETF for internet communications, and the IEEE, or the ISO organizations for other types. The ITU-T handles telecommunications protocols and formats. 

Index page for network protocols and protocol layers, categorised by the nearest matching layers of the OSI seven layer model. 

Systems engineering principles have been applied to design network protocols.

===Common Internet protocols===
Common Internet protocols include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), UDP/IP (User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

;TCP/IP : TCP/IP is a stream protocol. This means that a connection is negiotated between a client and a server. Any data transmitted between these two endpoints is guaranteed to arrive, thus it is a so-called lossless protocol. Since the TCP protocol (as it is also refered to in short form) can only connect two endpoints, it is also called a peer-to-peer protocol. 

;HTTP : HTTP is the protocol used to transmit all data present on the World Wide Web. This includes text, multimedia and graphics. It is the protocol used to transmit HTML, the language that makes all the fancy decorations in your browser. It works upon TCP/IP.

;FTP : FTP is the protocol used to transmit files between computers connected to each other by a TCP/IP network, such as the Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proxy servers provide a cache of items available on other servers which are presumably slower, more expensive to access or unavailable from the local network. 

The process of proxying a network through a single host on another network is called network masquerading or IP-masquerading if the source and target networks use the Internet Protocol.

This term is used particularly for a World Wide Web server which accepts URLs with a special prefix. When it receives a request for such a URL, it strips off the prefix and looks for the resulting URL in its local cache. If found, it returns the document immediately, otherwise it fetches it from the remote server, saves a copy in the cache and returns it to the requester. The cache will usually have an expiry algorithm which flushes documents according to their age, size, and access history. 

The Squid cache is the popular http proxy server in UNIX/Linux world. However, Apache's mod_proxy module also provides proxying and caching capabilities, and has the advantage of already being installed on nearly all systems.

This page attempts to define what Wikibooks is, what it is not, and what distinguishes it from other Wikimedia projects. The descriptions on this page are relatively '''brief'''. Detailed discussion or debate should happen on the talk page.

== What is Wikibooks ==
Simply, '''Wikibooks''' is a collection of [[w:open content|open-content]] [[w:textbooks|textbooks]].

Because the word '''textbook''' is open to interpretation, this document exists to help clarify which types of content are acceptable for Wikibooks. For example, ''The Complete Works of Shakespeare'' might be considered a ''textbook'' in an English Literature course, but such a text would be inappropriate for this site.

=== What Wikibooks includes ===

Wikibooks is for textbooks, annotated texts, instructional guides, and manuals.  These materials can be used in a traditional classroom, an accredited or respected institution, a home-school environment, as part of a [[v:Main Page|Wikiversity]] course, or for self-learning.  As a general rule, only instructional books are suitable for inclusion.  Non-fictional books (as well as fictional ones) that aren't instructional aren't allowed on Wikibooks.  Literary elements, such as allegory or fables, that are used as instructional tools can be permitted in some situations.

Wikibooks includes [[Wikibooks:Incubator|both minor and major book-like projects]].

Materials which may not be appropriate for Wikibooks should only be removed in accordance with the [[WB:DP|deletion policy]].

=== Wikibooks includes annotated texts ===
{{Main|Wikibooks:Annotated texts}}

Although we do not permit verbatim copies of pre-existing works, we do permit [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts|annotated texts]], which are a kind of text that includes an original text within it and serves as a guide to reading or studying that text. Annotated editions of previously published source texts may only be written if the source text is compatible with the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|project's license]].

As a point of overlap between the two projects, [[Wikisource:Main Page|Wikisource]] also allows the inclusion of annotated texts. If you would like to write a sparsely annotated text or a sparsely critical edition of a text, consider hosting your work more appropriately on Wikisource instead.

== What Wikibooks is not ==
{{shortcut|WB:WIN|WB:NOT}}
Below is a list of things that '''Wikibooks is not'''.  Keeping this list in mind while editing will help us stay on task.

=== Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider ===
{{shortcut|WB:HOST}}
You may not host your own website, blog, or wiki at Wikibooks. If you are interested in using the [[w:wiki|wiki technology]] for a collaborative effort on something else, even if it is just a single page, there are many sites that provide wiki hosting (free or for money).  You can also [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/ install wiki software] on your own server. (See the [[mw:Manual:Installation guide|MediaWiki installation guide]] for information on doing this.)

'''Wikibooks pages are not personal homepages.''' Wikibookians have their own personal pages, but they are used for information relevant to working on free textbooks and other content on Wikibooks. If you are looking to make a personal webpage unrelated to textbook work (e.g. posting your résumé), please make use of one of the many free homepage providers on the Internet.

=== Wikibooks is not a soapbox ===
{{shortcut|WB:SOAP|WB:BLOG}}
Wikibooks is not a [[wikt:soapbox|soapbox]], or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikibooks modules are not:
#'''[[w:propaganda|propaganda]] or [[w:advocacy|advocacy]]''' of any kind.  Wikibooks modules must always adhere to the [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]].  You might wish to go to [[w:Usenet|Usenet]] or start your own [[w:blog|blog]] if you want to convince people of the merits of your favourite views.
# '''personal essays''' that state your particular opinions about a topic.  Wikibooks is not a vehicle to make personal opinions become part of human knowledge. 
# '''[[w:advertising|advertising]] or self-promotion'''.  We don't need books or modules on items just because a contributor is associated with them.  Please note that Wikibooks does not endorse any business and it does not set up affiliate programs.

=== Wikibooks is not a mirror or a text repository{{anchor|NOR}}===
{{shortcut|WB:NOR|WB:OR|WB:SOURCE}}
{{Main|Wikibooks:Annotated texts}}

#'''Fiction or literature''' &amp;mdash; Wikibooks does not allow original fiction or literature. One place to write original fiction is [[wikia:fiction|Fiction Wikia]].
#'''Primary research''' &amp;mdash; Wikibooks is not a place to publish primary research.  Examples of things not allowed on Wikibooks include proposing new theories and solutions, presenting original ideas, defining new terms, and coining new words.  In short, primary research should be published elsewhere, such as a peer-reviewed journal, or our sister project [[v:Wikiversity:What is Wikiversity?#Wikiversity for researching|Wikiversity]].
#'''Published texts''' &amp;mdash; Wikibooks is for collaboratively developing new open-content non-fiction texts. [[:wikisource:|Wikisource]] is for hosting static texts that have been previously published and are now either in the public domain or have been released under a compatible license. Exceptions are made for [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts|annotated texts]], which are a kind of '''educational material''' that ''includes'' an original text within it and serves as a guide to reading or studying that text.

=== Wikibooks is not paper ===
{{shortcut|WB:NOTPAPER}}
[[m:Wiki is not paper|Wikibooks is '''not paper''']]. Thus, Wikibooks has no size limits, can include links, etc. It also means that the style and length of writing appropriate for paper may not be appropriate here.  The authors of a Wikibook module don't worry about an event occurring tomorrow that makes all the large, expensive paper copies outdated, as the Wikibook will change as well.

=== Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia ===
{{shortcut|WB:NOTWP|WB:NOTWIKIPEDIA}}
'''Wikibooks is not an in-depth encyclopedia on a specific topic''' nor are pages '''encyclopedia-formatted articles'''. Books build knowledge from one page to the next with inter-dependency between pages. Books in progress are sometimes organized in an encyclopedic manner until developed into proper books. For an encyclopedia, see our sister project [[w:|Wikipedia]].

=== Wikibooks is not a news service ===
{{shortcut|WB:NEWS}}
Wikibooks is not the place to publish news articles.  That is covered by our sister project [[:Wikinews:|Wikinews]].

=== Wikibooks is not a dictionary ===
{{shortcut|WB:DICT}}
Although a [[wikt:dictionary|dictionary]] is a book, the needs of a general-purpose dictionary are better served at our sister project, [[wikt:Main Page|Wiktionary]]. Also:
#'''Wikibooks is not a [[wikt:thesaurus|thesaurus]].''' There is a thesaurus project at [[wikt:Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|Wiktionary:Wikisaurus]]. Books that only give lists of synonyms or slang should be deleted from Wikibooks.
#'''Exception:''' Wikibooks does allow and encourage projects that require supplemental dictionaries or thesauri, such as a [[wikt:glossary|glossary]]. For example, a mathematical textbook might need a glossary of math terms; a foreign language textbook might include an English-to-foreign and foreign-to-English dictionary. For these dictionaries and thesauri to remain, they must be [[wikt:secondary|secondary]] and [[wikt:auxiliary|auxiliary]] to a main text.

=== Wikibooks is not for developing new Wikimedia projects ===
{{shortcut|WB:NOTMETA}}
[[m:Proposals for new projects|New Wikimedia projects]] should be proposed at [[m:|Meta-Wiki]] and not developed at Wikibooks.

=== Wikibooks is not censored for the protection of minors ===
{{shortcut|WB:CENSOR}}
Wikibooks is '''not [[w:censorship|censored]] for the 'protection of minors'''' ([[w:MPAA film rating system|content-rated]]). First, anyone can edit a [[WB:MODULE|module]] and the results are displayed instantaneously, so we cannot guarantee that a child will see or read nothing their parents may find objectionable.  Second, Wikibooks has no organized system for the removal of material that might be thought likely to harm minors. However, modules can be, and are, censored by consensus.

It is important to note that content that would typically be considered offensive is usually a violation of one or more of the previously mentioned policies or contains copyrighted content which is removed from this project without regards to its social value.  Random defacement of pages and adding profanity is usually considered an act of vandalism and removed quickly without any formal community discussion taking place.  Unfortunately you might just be viewing some page on Wikibooks immediately after this offensive content was added, and although we try very hard to clean up stuff like this as quickly as we can, we do miss some stuff every once in a while.

Pages have &quot;flagged revisions&quot; which have been validated by users to be of at least minimal quality.  If set in [[Special:Preferences]] for a user, choosing to view only the stable version of pages will often provide a reading experience that is free of vandalism.

=== Wikibooks is not for video game strategy guides ===
{{shortcut|WB:GUIDE}}
Wikibooks is not for video game strategy guides and walk-throughs.  Walk-throughs and strategy guides for video games are not acceptable instructional materials for, and do not belong on Wikibooks.  However, other books about video games, such as scholarly analysis of video games or guides on the design of video games, are allowed here.  One place for writing strategy guides is [[Strategywiki:|StrategyWiki]].

----
In Polish it is possible to move words around in the sentence, and to drop subject or object if they are obvious from context.
These sentences mean basically the same &quot;Henia has a cat&quot;, although they are used in different contexts:
* Henia ma kota (simple statement)
* Henia kota ma (It's a cat Henia has)
* Kota ma Henia (It's Henia who has a cat)
* Ma Henia kota 
* Kota Henia ma (the action &quot;has&quot; is emphasized)
* Ma kota Henia 

Use the first word order, unless emphasizing something.

If apparent from the context, you can drop the subject, object or even the verb:
* Ma kota - can be used if it's obvious who is being talked about
* Ma - answer for &quot;Czy Henia ma kota ?&quot; (Does Henia have a cat?)
* Henia - answer for &quot;Kto ma kota ?&quot; (Who has a cat?)
* Kota - answer for &quot;Co ma Henia?&quot; (What does Henia have?)
* Henia ma - this sounds least natural. There is a tendency in Polish to drop the subject rather than the object and rarely you know the object but not the subject. If the question was &quot;Kto ma kota ?&quot; (who has a cat ?), the answer should be &quot;Henia&quot; alone, without a verb.

In particular, &quot;ja&quot; and &quot;ty&quot;, and also their plural equivalents &quot;my&quot; and &quot;wy&quot;, are almost always dropped.

=Vertebrate digestive system =
&lt;br&gt;Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive membrane.

'''Digestive tract''': tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or
cloacae in bird, reptile or monotreme.

'''Lumanal glands''': empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).

Tract divided into three main regions:
&lt;br&gt;1. buccal cavity
&lt;br&gt;2. pharynx&amp;nbsp;
&lt;br&gt;3. alimentary canal

Alimentary canal divided into four regions:
&lt;br&gt;1. esophagus
&lt;br&gt;2. stomach
&lt;br&gt;3. small intestine&amp;nbsp;
&lt;br&gt;4. large intestine

'''Accessory digestive glands''', outside digestive tract proper, secrete
into lumen of tract through ducts. Includes the '''salivary glands''', '''liver'''
and '''pancreas'''.

'''Buccal cavity''', which includes '''palate''' and '''tongue''',
develops from infolding of '''stomadeum''', or second opening of blastula,
whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the '''primitive
gut'''.

'''Teeth''': capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further
process and break down food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.

'''Tooth anatomy''':
&lt;br&gt;1. '''crown''' projects above gum,
&lt;br&gt;2. '''root''' below gum,
&lt;br&gt;3. '''enamel''' is outer coating of crown, hardest surface in body,
of epideral origin
&lt;br&gt;4. '''dentin''', below enamel, bone-like and forms bulk of tooth,
is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels. (Remember that mammals are '''heterodontic''', with different types of teeth).

'''Pharynx''': air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important
in lower vertebrates, site of gills. Features derived from '''pharyngeal'''
region: first pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts of the ear, other pouches
give rise to various other structures.

'''Alimentary canal''': epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into
lumen, longitudinal and circular muscles help digestive movements ('''peristalsis''').

'''Esophagus''': tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to
fit large '''bolus''' (lump of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication.
Birds have '''crop''' for storage, enlargement of esophagus.

'''Epiglottis''': keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,”
or fix.

'''Stomach'''. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice
with enzymes, mucous, HCl, released by '''chief''' and '''parietal cells'''
(release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. '''Rugae''': folds of stomach,
disappear when full. '''Sphincter''' at both ends of stomach, control
food passage.

'''Chyme''': semi-digested food released to small intestine.

'''Small intestine''': three regions, '''duodenum''', '''jejunum''',
and '''ileum'''.

'''Duodenum''' site of most intestinal digestion. '''Jejunum''' and
'''ileum''' do most of intestinal absorption. Ileum ends with another
sphincter, '''ileocolic valve''' or ileosecal valve. Structure: Circular
folds covered with '''villi''' (singular is villus).

'''Villi''': finger-like cellular projections, covered with '''microvilli''',
tiny projections which increase surface area. Increases surface area by
900x, speeds '''digestion''' (break down) and '''absorption''' (taking
in nutrients).

'''Large intestine''': larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine.
No villi. In mammals, forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight
region, rectum, empties into outside world through anal sphincter. Colon:
absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released by bacteria which
live there (vitamin K).

'''Food''': made up of 1. '''proteins''', 2. '''fats''', 3. '''carbohydrates''' 4. '''fibrous material'''.

Digestive system breaks foods down. '''Proteins''' must be broken to
'''amino acids''' to be absorbed. '''Polysaccharides''' to '''monosaccharides''',
'''lipids''' to '''fatty acids''' and '''monoglycerides''' to absorb.

'''Salivary glands''' in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a
few enzymes (amalase, begins starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland,
mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes. Breaks down blood vessels and
disables nervous system.

'''Stomach enzymes''': released in inactive form, '''zymogene''',
converts to active form in lumen of gut. Transformation is triggered by
another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. '''Pepsin''' secreted as '''pepsinogen'''
(-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or three
liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.

'''Chyme''' released to '''duodenum'''.

'''Small intestine''' has two major accessory glands:
&lt;br&gt;1. '''pancreas'''
&lt;br&gt;2. '''liver'''

'''Pancreas''' has ''' endocrine''' and '''exocrine''' functions, releases
large amounts of carbonate to neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes
work in neutral pH, and stuff to break down lipids and starch (zymogens,
like tripsin)

'''Liver''' releases '''bile'''. Bile made from cholesterol, stored
in '''gall bladder''', released in duodenum, emulsifies fats.''''''

'''Emulsify''': keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing
surface area and action of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine,
taken to liver for processing. Fatty acids go to lymphatic system

'''Appendix''': vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems
within mammals: herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.

'''Rumen''': four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant
herbivores). Cellulose resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to
break down cellulose. Some bacteria, protists and fungi can break down
cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down cellulose in rumen,
to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow swallows
to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).

'''Coprophagy''': rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious
products of the cecum.</text>

=Circulatory system=

'''Circulatory system functions'''

1. '''Transportation'''&lt;br&gt;
  a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate of
diffusion&lt;br&gt;
  b. Nutrition:&lt;br&gt;
  c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Regulation'''&lt;br&gt;
  a. Transport hormones&lt;br&gt;
  b. Regulate body temperature&lt;br&gt;
  c. Protection&lt;br&gt;
     i.  Blood clotting&lt;br&gt;
     ii.  Immune system (carries white blood cells)

'''Vasodilation''': allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant
ears, takes more blood to surface of body, sweating may accompany

'''Countercurrent heat exchange''': used by dolphins in fins to conserve
heat in cold water. Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body
absorbs heat from blood traveling out from body to fin, minimizing heat
loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.

Blood made of
&lt;br&gt;1. '''plasma''' and
&lt;br&gt;2. '''formed cellular elements''' (red and white blood cells, and
platelets).

Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume.  Cellular elements make up the other 45%.

'''Plasma makeup''': 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins ('''albumin'''
maintains blood osmotic integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1%
elements in transit

'''Red blood cell''' ('''erythrocyte'''): contains '''hemoglobin''',
functions in oxygen transport. In mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei
on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape. No self repair, live
120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells. About
7-8 micrometers in diameter.

'''Hematocrit''': proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about
43% in humans on average.  48% for men and 38% for women.

'''White blood cells''' ('''leukocytes'''): Nucleated, about 10-14
micrometers in diameter, commonly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in
capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes,
B- and T-cell lymphocytes.

'''Platelets''' ('''thrombocytes''') Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus.
In non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at
site of broken blood vessels, form clots. Bud off special cells in bone
marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8 day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as
abundant as white blood cells.

'''Arteries''': carry blood '''away''' from heart. Smallest tubes
called '''arterioles''', feed blood to capillaries.

'''Veins''': return blood to heart. Smallest veins called '''venules'''.

Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out:
&lt;br&gt;1. '''epithelium''' (endothelium),
&lt;br&gt;2. '''elastic connective tissue fibers''',
&lt;br&gt;3. '''smooth muscle''',
&lt;br&gt;4. '''connective tissue'''. Arteries have thicker elastic layer than
do veins.

'''Capillaries''', where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin
and narrow, and red blood cells pass through single file. Capillaries are
tiny but numerous, and their total volume is greater than that of supplying
arteries.

Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure
highest in arteries, lower in capillaries and arteries.

Osmotic pressure draws interstitial fluid from blood in arterioles,
but replaces it in venules.

'''One-way valves''' mean that blood can flow only one way, works with
residual blood pressure and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure
in thoracic cavity caused by breathing also helps move blood.

'''Lymphatic system''': part of the immune system, a one-way, or '''open''', system. Takes up '''interstitial fluid''' not taken up by venules.

'''Lymphatic structures''':&lt;br&gt;
1. lymphatic '''capillaries'''&lt;br&gt;
2. lymphatic '''vesicles'''&lt;br&gt;
3. '''lymph nodes'''&lt;br&gt;
4. lymphatic '''organs''' ('''spleen''' and '''thymus''')

'''Lymph''': movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the heart via single large thoracic duct.

As lymph passes through system, passes '''lymphocytes''', second part of immune system.

'''Heart''': pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form two separate circulations&lt;br&gt;
1. '''pulmonary circulation''' to and from lungs and&lt;br&gt;
2. '''systemic circulation''' to and from tissues of body.

Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).

Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.

'''Pattern of blood flow through heart''': blood returning from '''major veins''' (vena cava) enters right '''atrium''', contraction there delivers blood to right '''ventricle''' through a '''tricuspid valve''', one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood through '''semi lunar valve''' into '''pulmonary circuit''' and to '''lungs'''.Blood return to heart in '''pulmonary veins''', is oxygenated. Goes to left '''atrium''', which contracts and delivers blood to left '''ventricle'''by way of '''aortic semi-lunar valve''', then goes to '''systemic circulation'''.

Both '''atria''' and '''ventricles''' contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system vs. just lungs).

'''Systole''': heart contraction, '''diastole''': heart relaxed

'''Timing of heart contraction''': '''ventricles''' rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and '''semi-lunar valves''' close. Both '''atria'''(singular: atrium) fill with blood coming from pulmonary and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the '''ventricles'''.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause, then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, '''atrio-ventricular(AV) valves''' shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries and from the right ventricle into the '''aorta'''.

Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called '''myogenic'''. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have '''neurogenic''' hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the '''cardiac ganglion'''.

The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the '''sino-atrial (SA)node''', or pacemaker. This is a '''phylogenic''' (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart that had one more chamber than modern hearts.

'''How the heart contracts''': waves of '''depolarization''' start in '''SA node''' and spread through '''atria'''. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular node. Signal continued by '''bundle branches '''to '''lower ventricle''', begins to stimulate heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at '''heart apex''',then signals spread through heart.

'''Medulla''' (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system. (The medulla is part of the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the body). '''Sympathetic cardiac accelerator'''connects to '''spinal cord''', uses '''norepinephrine''' to signal. '''Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center''' reaches heart through '''Vagus nerve''', uses'''acetylcholine''' to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction. (Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.) Dominant effect here is '''inhibitory'''. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about 25 bpm.

=Respiratory system=
In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system include '''airways''', '''lungs''', and the respiratory muscles.
  
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.

Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such as holes on the undersides of leaves known as '''stomata'''.

In mammals, the '''diaphragm''' divides the body cavity into the

   '''abdominal cavity''': contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)

   '''thoracic cavity''': contains the heart and lungs. 

'''Respiratory tree''': terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diffuses micrometer, very tiny distance.</text>

=Sensory systems=
Categorized by&lt;br&gt;
# '''nature of stimulus''', such as '''mechanical''', '''chemical'''or '''light''' stimulus, and&lt;br&gt;
# '''where stimulus received''', such as '''outside''' ('''exteroceptors''',such as the '''eye''' and '''skin temp receptors''') or '''inside'''body ('''interoceptors''', such as '''blood body temperature receptors''').

'''Transduction''' of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or carried, from environment into nervous signal.

Three sensory processes we cover&lt;br&gt;
# '''taste''' and '''smell''' (chemoreception)&lt;br&gt;
# '''gravity''' and '''movement'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
# '''light'''

==Taste and smell (chemoreception)==
Found in mammal nose and mouth, fly feet, fish bodies, moth antennae.

Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly.  Other “taste” sensations really smell.

Smell: received in '''nasopharynx'''. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one. Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has relatively unfiltered root to higher brain centers.

Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.

==Response to gravity and movement==
Registered in '''inner ear'''. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells deformed by gelatinous membrane. '''Vestibular apparatus''', gives us perception of gravity and movement. Due to '''physical response''', not chemical binding.

'''Cochlea''': bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.

Sound enters through '''auditory canal''', vibrates '''tympanic membrane''',moving three bones of middle ear ('''malleus''', '''incus''', and '''stapes''')against oval window opening in front of cochlea. Cochlea has three fluid filled ducts, one of these the '''organ of Corti'''. Sound waves in air go to vibration in organ of Corti; fluid tickles '''hair cells''', which register the movement along '''basilar membrane''' in cochlea. Different sound frequencies move different portions of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).

Transduction of sound accomplished throgh '''physical deformation''',not chemical binding.

==Vision==
Light enters '''pupil'', focused by '''lens''' onto '''retina'''.''''''

'''Sclera''': hardened part behind retina.

'''Optic nerves''' and '''neurons''' attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has no receptors.&amp;nbsp;

Two types of photoreceptors&lt;br&gt;
# '''rods''' - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.&lt;br&gt;
# '''cones''' - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.

'''Fovia''': region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.

Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod photopigment is called '''rhodopsin''',cone has three photopigments, called '''photopsins'''. This molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron leading to vision center in brain.'''Parul Godika'''

Each of the three photopsins has a different peak of sensitivity: '''blue''','''green''' or '''red''', and changes '''isometric form''' (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GenBioTOC}}

== Homeostasis ==
Is a very important part of everyone's and everything's lives.
Defined as '''dynamic constancy of internal environment''', maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside an organism usually involving '''feedback regulation'''.

'''Homeostasis''' is maintained in face of
# a '''varying external environment''', or
# a '''non-ideal, constant external environment''' (as with the penguin).&lt;br&gt;

Deals with '''temperature''', '''pH''', '''chemical concentrations''','''pressure''', '''oxygen levels'''.

Occurs through '''negative feedback loops'''.

Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns off heater when above a certain temperature and on when below a certain temperature Involves '''stimulus''', '''sensor''','''integrating center''', '''effector''' and '''response'''.

More efficient control has '''two sensors''' and '''two effectors'''. Can be antagonistic to each other, such as, one cools, the other heats.

Precise control through '''proportional control''', not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate, shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating, behavioral changes (get out of sun).

'''Positive feedback loop''': effector increases deviation from set point. Amplifies reaction. Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must exist at some point for control.

==Osmotic environments and regulations ==
# '''Marine invertebrates'''
## fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set internal environment same as environment, no net flow of ions) in a stenohaline (narrow non-changing salt level) environment
## Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels fluctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmoconfomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation) environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment get real low).
# '''Freshwater animals'''. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do living organisms so water tends to flow in and solutes out.
##Freshwater fish (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
## Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater fish but with different structures
## Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin
# '''Marine fishes''': Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does the organism so water tends to flow out and ions in.
## Bony fishes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
## cartilaginous fishes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide to increase its osmolality to that of seawater
# '''Terrestrial animals''': here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and regulation of salt levels.
## water loss adaptations
## concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes

'''Hypoosmotic''': having less osmotic potential than nearby fluid

'''Hyperosmotic''': having more osmotic potential than nearby fluid

'''Isoosmotic''': having equal osmotic potential than nearby fluid

'''Glomerulus''': reduces volume of kidney

Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.

Terrestrial animal water sources:&lt;br&gt;
1. drinking&lt;br&gt;
2. moist foods&lt;br&gt;
3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their water from metabolism.)

Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:&lt;br&gt;
1. '''ammonia''' (aquatic life)&lt;br&gt;
2. '''urea''' (mammals)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''uric acid''' (birds)

'''Ammonia''' very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony fishes.

'''Urea''': low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it. Must be released in solution, water cost.

'''Uric acid''' (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss, more costly side groups lost than the others.

'''Mammalian kidney''': Structure: fist-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a day.

'''Nephron''': structural and functional unit of kidney.

'''Bowmans capsule''': funnel-like opening, contains primary filter, the '''glomerulus'''.

'''Proximal convoluted tubule''': receives stuff from Bowmans capsule.

'''Loop of Henle''': descends and ascends.

'''Vasa recta''': capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.

'''Glomerulus''': main filter of the '''nephron''', located within the '''Bowman's capsule'''

Kidney properties and processes important to its function

1. '''Active transport of solutes''' from one fluid to another against a concentration gradient, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; actively transported out of filtrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into the interstitial fluid&lt;br&gt;
2. '''Passive movement of solutes''' and water from one fluid to another(down a concentration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into interstitial fluid.&lt;br&gt;
3. '''Differential permeability of cells''' in different regions of the nephron to movement of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is permeable to water&lt;br&gt;
4. '''Hormonal control of that permeability''', antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of filtrate and thus more concentrated urine.&lt;br&gt;
5. '''Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial fluid of the kidney''', from the cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

Comes from various sources, '''ectodermal''' or '''endodermal''' material. Cell sheet lines a surface or body cavity. One side, called '''freesurface or Apical''', is exposed to
* animal '''interior''' (forming the '''lumen''') or
* '''exterior''' of its '''body cavity'''.
The other side rests on the '''basal layer'''.

Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.

Two categories:
* '''sheets'''
* '''glands'''

Classified on two features:
* '''simple''', (a single layer of cells),
* '''stratified''', (more than one cell layer.)

Cell shape at free surface:
* '''squamous''' (broad and flat)
* '''cuboidal''' (spherish)
* '''columnar''' (tall and thin)

; '''Simple squamous epithelium''' : usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
; '''Simple cuboidal epithelium''' : in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
; '''Simple columnar epithelium''' : nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and lungs
; '''Stratified squamous epithelium''' : (important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, flat and keratinized, making them resistant to abrasion. Stratified squamous epithelium changes to columnar squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
; '''Epidermis''' : from epithelium. Below this is '''dermis''', thicker and with blood vessels.

Two specialized epithelia:
* '''pseudostratified'''
* '''transitional'''

; '''Pseudostratified epithelia''' : lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks stratified but not.
; '''Transitional epithelia''' : found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell layers deep.
; '''Glandular epithelia''' : ('''gland''': group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from '''epithelium'''. Glands are classified into '''endocrine''' and '''exocrine''' by where they excrete.
; '''Endocrine glands''' : secrete hormones into the '''blood''' without use of ducts.
; '''Exocrine glands''' : secrete onto the '''body surface''' or into a '''cavity''', thru a '''duct'''. Exocrine substances include sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the '''liver''', which secretes bile.</text>

=Connective tissue =
This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and supporting. Types include '''bone''', '''cartilage''', '''fibrous connective tissue''', '''blood''' and '''adipose''' (fat) tissue.

If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to see the basic form of the body.

'''Form''': distinctive cells surrounded by a '''cell matrix''' made of '''extra-cellular fiber''' grounded in a '''ground substance ''' (excluding blood)

Types:&lt;br&gt;
1. '''connectile connective tissues''' (can be 1. '''loose''' or 2. '''dense''')&lt;br&gt;
2. '''special connective tissue''' (includes blood, bones and cartilage).

'''Fibroblasts''' form '''connective tissue proper;'''&lt;br&gt;
'''chondoroblasts''' form '''cartilage;'''&lt;br&gt;asdasdasdasdasdasdads
'''osteoblasts''' form '''bone;'''&lt;br&gt;
and '''blood''' is formed from various sources.

'''Ground substance''': “unstructured” material that fills space between cells and contains fibers. Made of&lt;br&gt;
1. '''interstitial fluid''' (bathes cells)&lt;br&gt;
2. '''proteoglycans''' (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy to gelatin-like)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''cell-adhesion proteins''' (connect connective tissue cells to the fibers).

'''Fibers''' of '''connective tissue''':&lt;br&gt;
1. '''Collagen''' (flexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant protein in animals, white)&lt;br&gt;
2. '''elastin''' (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''andreticulin''' (like collagen).

'''Loose connective tissue''': found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include '''fibroblasts''', '''macrophages''', '''mast cells''',and '''adipose cells'''. '''Fibers''' include '''collagen''' and '''elastic fibers'''. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.

'''Dense connective tissue''': largely densely packed fibers of '''collagen''' or '''elastin''' regularly or irregularly arranged. Forms '''tendons''' and '''ligaments''', coverings of muscles, capsules around organs and joints, and '''dermis''' of skin.

'''Cartilage vs. bone'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Cartilage: '''There are three cartilage types:&lt;br&gt;
1. '''hyaline''' cartilage&lt;br&gt;
2. '''fibrocartilage''' (fibrous cartilage)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''elastic''' cartilage

'''Hyaline cartilage''': most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly '''collagen''', name refers to '''glassy''' appearance. In embryo, bones form first as '''hyaline''' cartilage, later '''ossifies'''. Found in tracheal rings. Few collagen fibers.

'''Fibrous cartilage''': have lots of '''collagen''' fibers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic symphesis. Grades into dense '''tendon''' and '''ligament''' tissue.

'''Elastic cartilage''': springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in epiglottis, yellow when fresh.

'''Chondrocites''' (cartilage cells) rely on diffusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.

'''Bone''': Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit called '''osteon''', or '''Hyvercian system'''. Concentric rings around central canal with blood vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our concern: simple pattern for mammals.

'''Lacuna''' (spaces in which osteocytes found); '''canaliculi''' (little canals) bigger diagonal cells, layers of bone called '''lamellae.'''

Three types of bone cells, ending in&lt;br&gt;
-'''blast''', (mend bone)&lt;br&gt;
-'''cyte''' (fortify bone)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
-'''clast''' (tear down bone)

Classified by&lt;br&gt;
1. '''appearance''' ('''spongy''' vs. '''hard''')&lt;br&gt;
2. '''where found''' (outside or inside)&lt;br&gt;
3. '''how it is formed''' (endochondral cartilage model forms first and then is ossified, and entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)

Example of '''endochondral bone formation''': long bone begins to ossify from center shaft, calcified region expands and cuts off diffusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In young mammals, secondary ossification centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossified. In other animals, bones continue growing throughout their lifetime.

Three types of '''intramembrous bone''':&lt;br&gt;
1. '''dermal''' bone&lt;br&gt;
2. '''sessamoid''' bone&lt;br&gt;
3. '''perichondral''' bone.

'''Dermal bone''' forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal armor of ancestor. Comes from '''mesoderm''', in dermis of skin.

'''Sessamoid bones''': form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with stress.

'''Perichondral bone''' means '''“around cartilage,”''' forms around cartilage or bone. Functions in bone repair and in ossification of endochondral bone.

'''Bone remodeling and repair''': bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures, which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced. '''Osteoclasts''' channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind '''osteoblasts''' and '''lacuna''', leaving '''osteocytes'''. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is preventative maintenance.

When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, '''periosteum''' gives rise to new bone with calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue fixing over time and slowly removing imperfection.</text>

=Muscle tissue = 

Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: '''supply force for movement''', '''restrain movement''', proper '''posture''', act on viscera (internal organs) for '''peristalsis''' (moving food down digestive tract), give body '''shape''', form '''sphincters''', (such as in esophagus, between stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in '''sheets''' of muscles, affect ai'''r flow''' in and out of lungs, line '''blood vessels''' and play vital role in '''circulation'''.

Secondary roles: '''heat production''' (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement metabolism). 

Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical field created by fish muscles. Some fish formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators or stun prey. Other fish can use field as “radar” to see things and communicate with other animals. (Evolved independently in different groups). 

Different classifications: by '''color''', (red or white) '''location''', nature of '''nervous system contro'''l (voluntary or involuntary), '''embryonic origin''', or by '''general microscopic appearance''' (striated, smooth, and cardiac.) 

'''Striated muscle''' (or '''skeletal''' muscle): under '''voluntary control'''. Individual cells called '''fibers''', grouped into '''fascicle'''. '''Myofibrils''' founding one cell made of even smaller '''myofilaments'''. Each striated cell very long and '''multi-nucleated'''. Fibers joined end to end to form longer '''composite fibers'''. '''Sarcomeres''': repeating units make up '''myofibrils'''. Two kinds of '''myofilaments''', thick kind made up of '''myosin''' and thin of '''actin'''. Striations visible in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope. 

'''Cardiac muscle''': occurs only in '''heart'''. Light banding visible under light microscope. Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercollated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart transplants.) 

'''Smooth muscle''': no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely '''visceral''' function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up), lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short, fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size. 

Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myofibrils. Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myofilaments: &lt;br&gt;
1. thick, '''myosin''' filament &lt;br&gt;
2. thin, '''actin''' filament. 

'''Sarcomere''': Thick and thin filaments interspersed in ordered grid. 

'''Sliding filament theory''': thick and thin filaments move past each other in opposite direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell bio for details). 

'''Myosin molecule''': two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end. 

'''Myosin filament''': many slender myosin molecules together. 

'''Actin filament''': chain of actin single, '''tropomyosin''' strands with repeated '''globular troponin''', and with '''actin'''. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites that bind to actin. Actin filaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin. 

'''Troponin''' has '''four site'''s: &lt;br&gt;
1. one to bind '''myosin''' &lt;br&gt;
2. one for '''actin''' &lt;br&gt;
3. one for '''tropomyocin''' &lt;br&gt;
4. one for '''calcium ions''' 

Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter, that diffuses across cell membrane ('''sarcolimic reticulum''') and binds to receptors in it. Receptor is '''acetylcholine''', ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions. 

Lacking calcium, '''tropomyosin''' site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and heads bind to '''actin''' molecules, delivering force to move '''fibers''' in relation to each other. Myocin head then interacts with '''ATP''' to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it fires again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal, '''sarcoplasmic reticulum''' sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs. 

'''Quirari (or curare)''': known from movies, used in South America, blocks '''acetylcholine receptors''' in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t breathe. 

'''Duchenne's muscular dystrophy''': degeneration of '''sarcolema''', plasma membrane of muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies. 

'''Fast''' and '''slow twitch fibers''': vertebrate muscle fiber. Terms relative within one group of animals. Differences related to differences in '''enervation''', type of '''myocin''', and '''actin activation'''. 

Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. '''active''' component 2. '''elastic''' component (energy stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue around tendons. Especially important in '''limb oscillation''', like running, or trunk twisting, like fish swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.) 

How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways: &lt;br&gt;
1. '''rate modulation''', derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus. &lt;br&gt;
2. '''selective involvement of motor units''', a given neuron enervates a fixed number of muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle. 

How do muscles grow stronger? &lt;br&gt;
1. add more '''myofilaments''', increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets working &lt;br&gt;
2. proliferation in '''blood vessels''' and '''connective tissue''' around muscle 

Muscle strength is relative to '''cross sectional area''', not length. Not always feasible to add more cross sectional area. 

'''Pinnate fibers''': oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circumstances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out. 

Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation between fibers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is greater. 

'''Synergist muscles''': muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction. Bicep shares work with brachialis. 

'''Antagonist muscles''': muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls it back out. 

'''Origin vs. insertion''': origin is the end of the muscle that more fixed in its attachment to the body. The more movable end called insertion. 

'''Fixators''': muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you clench your fist hard. 

'''Flexors and extensors''': applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another about limb, extensor straightens it. 

'''Adductor and abductor''': adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).</text>

The word ''stoichiometry'' derives from two Greek words: ''stoicheion'' (meaning &quot;element&quot;) and ''metron'' (meaning &quot;measure&quot;). Stoichiometry deals with calculations about the masses (sometimes volumes) of reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. It is a very mathematical part of chemistry, so be prepared for lots of calculator use.

{{Wikipedia|Stoichiometry}}
Jeremias Benjaim Richter (1762-1807) was the first to lay down the principles of stoichiometry. In 1792 he wrote: 
&quot;''Die stöchyometrie (Stöchyometria) ist die Wissenschaft die quantitativen oder Massenverhältnisse zu messen, in welchen die chymischen Elemente gegen einander stehen.''&quot; [Stoichiometry is the science of measuring the quantitative proportions or mass ratios in which chemical elements stand to one another.]

==Molar Calculations==
===Your Tool: Dimensional Analysis===
Luckily, almost all of stoichiometry can be solved relatively easily using dimensional analysis.  Dimensional analysis is just using units, instead of numbers or variables, to do math, usually to see how they cancel out.  For instance, it is easy to see that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;grams \times \dfrac{moles}{grams} \times \dfrac{atoms}{moles} = atoms&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It is this principle that will guide you through solving most of the stoichiometry problems (chemical reaction problems) you will see in General Chemistry.  Before you attempt to solve a problem, ask yourself: what do I have now? where am I going?  As long as you know how many (units) per (other units), this will make stoichiometry significantly easier.

===Moles to Mass===
{{SideBox|Where can you find the molar mass of these elements? [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table|The periodic table.]] You should always have one on hand—don't expect to get very far without one!}}

''How heavy is 1.5 mol of lead? How many moles in 22.34g of water?'' Calculating the mass of a sample from the number of moles it contains is quite simple. We use the '''molar mass''' (mass of one mole) of the substance to convert between mass and moles. When writing calculations, we denote the molar mass of a substance by an upper case &quot;M&quot; (e.g. M(Ne) means &quot;the molar mass of neon&quot;). As always, &quot;n&quot; stands for the number of moles and &quot;m&quot; indicates the mass of a substance.  To find the solutions to the two questions we just asked, let's apply some dimensional analysis:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.5 \; mol \; Pb \; \times \dfrac{207.2 \; g \; Pb}{1 \; mol \; Pb} = 310.8 \; g \; Pb&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Can you see how the units cancel to give you the answer you want?  All you needed to know was that you had 1.5 mol Pb (lead), and that 1 mol Pb weighs 207.2 grams.  Thus, multiplying 1.5 mol Pb by 207.2 g Pb and dividing by 1 mol Pb gives you 310.8 g Pb, your answer.

===Mass to Moles===
But we had one more question: &quot;How many moles in 22.34g of water?&quot;  This is just as easy:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;22.34 \; g \; H_2 O \; \times \dfrac{1 \; mol \; H_2 O}{18 \; g \; H_2 O} = 1.24 \; mol \; H_2 O&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where did the 18 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O come from?  We looked at the periodic table and simply added up the atomic masses of two hydrogens and an oxygen to get the molecular weight of water.  This turned out to be 18, and since all the masses on the periodic table are given with respect to 1 mole, we knew that 1 mol of water weighed 18 grams.  This gave us the relationship above, which is really just (again) watching units cancel out!

===Calculating Molar Masses===
Before we can do these types of calculations, we first have to know the molar mass. Fortunately, this is not difficult, as the molar mass is exactly the same as the '''atomic weight''' of an element. A table of atomic weights can be used to find the molar mass of elements (this information is often included in the periodic table). For example, the atomic weight of oxygen is &lt;B&gt;16.00&lt;/B&gt; amu, so its molar mass is 16.00 g/mol.

For species with more than one element, we simply add up the atomic weights of each element to obtain the molar mass of the compound. For example, sulfur trioxide gas is made up of sulfur and oxygen, whose atomic weights are 32.06 and 16.00 respectively.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\hbox{M(SO}_3\hbox{)} &amp;=&amp; 32.06 + 3 \times 16.00 \\
\ &amp;=&amp; 80.06 \hbox{g}/\hbox{mol} \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The procedure for more complex compounds is essentially the same. Aluminium carbonate, for example, contains aluminium, carbon, and oxygen. To find the molar mass, we have to be careful to find the ''total'' number of atoms of each element. Three carbonate ions each containing three oxygen atoms gives a total of nine oxygens. The atomic weights of aluminium and carbon are 26.98 and 12.01 respectively.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\hbox{M}(\hbox{Al}_2(\hbox{CO}_3)_3) &amp;=&amp; 2 \times 26.98 + 3 \times 12.01 + 9 \times 16.00 \\
\ &amp;=&amp; 233.99 \hbox{g}/\hbox{mol} \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Empirical Formulae==
The empirical formula of a substance is ''the simplest ratio of the number of moles of each element in a compound''. The empirical formula is ambiguous, e.g. the formula CH could represent CH, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; etc. These latter formulae are called '''molecular formulae'''. It follows that the molecular formula is always a ''whole number multiple'' of the empirical formula for a compound.

Calculating the empirical formula is easy if the relative amounts of each element in the compound are known. For example, if a sample contains 1.37 mol oxygen and 2.74 mol hydrogen, we can calculate the empirical formula. A good strategy to use is to divide all amounts given by the smallest '''non-integer''' amount, then multiply by whole numbers until the simplest ratio is found. We can make a table showing the successive ratios.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;border:1px;text-align:center;&quot;
|-
! Hydrogen
! Oxygen
|-
| 2.74 || 1.37 || divide by 1.37
|-
| 2 || 1 || ANSWER
|}

The empirical formula of the compound is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Here's another example.  A sample of piperonal contains 1.384 mol carbon, 1.033 mol hydrogen and 0.519 mol oxygen.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;border:1px; text-align:center;&quot;
|-
! Carbon
! Hydrogen
! Oxygen
|-
| 1.384 || 1.033 || 0.519 || divide by 0.519
|-
| 2.666 || 2 || 1 || multiply by 3
|-
| 8 || 6 || 3 || ANSWER
|}

The empirical formula of piperonal is C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Converting from Masses===
Often, we are given the relative composition by mass of a substance and asked to find the empirical formula. These masses must first be converted to moles using the techniques outlined above. For example, a sample of ethanol contains 52.1% carbon, 13.2% hydrogen, and 34.7% oxygen by mass. Hypothetically, 100g of this substance will contain 52.1 g carbon, 13.2 g hydrogen and 34.7 g oxygen. Dividing these by their respective molar masses gives the amount in moles of each element (as we learned above). These are 4.34 mol, 13.1 mol, and 2.17 mol respectively.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;border:1px; text-align:center;&quot;
|-
! Carbon
! Hydrogen
! Oxygen
|-
| 4.34 || 13.1 || 2.17 || divide by 2.17
|-
| 2 || 6 || 1 || ANSWER
|}

The empirical formula of ethanol is C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O.

===Molecular Formula===
{{SideBox|1=
'''Beware:'''
In the case of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the whole number multiple is 1, so its empirical formula is the same as its molecular formula.  This is not always the case!}}
As mentioned above, the molecular formula for a substance equals the count of atoms of each type in a molecule.  This is always a ''whole number multiple'' of the empirical formula.  To calculate the molecular formula from the empirical formula, we need to know the '''molar mass''' of the substance. For example, the empirical formula for '''benzene''' is CH, and its molar mass is 78.12 g/mol. Divide the actual molar mass by the mass of the empirical formula, 13.02 g/mol, to determine the multiple of the empirical formula, &quot;n&quot;. The molecular formula equals the empirical formula multiplied by &quot;n&quot;.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\hbox{M(CH)} &amp;=&amp; 13.02 \hbox{ g/mol} \\
\hbox{M(benzene)} &amp;=&amp; 78.12 \hbox{ g/mol}\\
\hbox{M(benzene)} / \hbox{M(CH)} &amp;= (78.12\ g/mol)/(13.02\ g/mol)&amp;= 6 \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This shows that the molecular formula for benzene is 6 times the empirical formula of CH. The molecular formula for benzene is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Solving Mass-Mass Equations==
A typical mass-mass equation will give you an amount in grams and ask for another answer in grams.

#Convert the given quantity to moles.
#Multiply by the molar ratio of the demanded substance over the given substance.
#Convert the demanded substance into grams.
}}

For example, given the equation &lt;math&gt;Cu^{2+} + 2 AgNO_3 \to Cu(NO_3)_2 + 2 Ag^+&lt;/math&gt;, find out how many grams of silver (Ag) will result from 43.0 grams of copper (Cu) reacting.

*Convert the given quantity to moles.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;43.0g~Cu \times \frac{1~mol~Cu}{63.55g~Cu}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
*Multiply by the molar ratio of the demanded substance and the given substance.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;43.0g~Cu \times \frac{1~mol~Cu}{63.55g~Cu} \times \frac{2~mol~Ag}{1~mol~Cu}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
*Convert the demanded substance to grams.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;43.0g~Cu \times \frac{1~mol~Cu}{63.55g~Cu} \times \frac{2~mol~Ag}{1~mol~Cu} \times \frac{107.86g~Ag}{1~mol~Ag} = 1.46 \times 10^2~g~Ag&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Summary ==

To solve a stoichiometric problem, you need to know what you already have and what you want to find.  Everything in between is basic algebra.

{{TextBox|1=
; Key Terms
*''Molar mass:'' mass (in grams) of one mole of a substance.
*''Empirical formula:'' the simplest ratio of the number of moles of each element in a compound
*''Molecular formula:'' the actual ratio of the number of moles of each element in a compound
}}

In general, all you have to do is keep track of the units and how they cancel, and you will be on your way!

An '''adverb''' is a word added to a verb, a participle, an adjective, or an other adverb; and generally expresses time, place, degree, or manner: as,

*&quot;They are now here, studying very diligently.&quot;

Adverbs can modify a verb, a clause, adjective or a phrase.


==Form==

Adjectives are generally turned into adverbs with the addition of a ''ly'' suffix. ''Ly'' is a contraction of like, and is the most common termination of adverbs. When added to nouns, it forms adjectives; but a few of these are also used adverbially: as, ''daily, weekly, monthly''.

Examples of adverbs are:
*&quot;Jack is swimming ''quickly''.&quot;
*&quot;''Unfortunately'', he lost the race.&quot;
*&quot;We told him to run ''much'' faster.&quot;

In the first sentence, the adverb modifies the verb swimming. The adjective ''quick'' has had a ''ly'' added to it to make an adverb. In the second sentence, it modifies the entire sentence and in the final example, the adverb ''much'' modifies the adverb ''faster''.

==Comparative forms of adverbs==

Adverbs have no modifications, except that a few are compared, after the manner of adjectives: as, ''soon, sooner, soonest; long, longer, longest; fast, faster, fastest''.

The following are irregularly compared: ''well, better, best; badly or ill, worse, worst; little, less, least; much, more, most; far, farther, farthest; forth, further, furthest''.

==Kinds of adverbs==

Adverbs may be reduced to four general classes; namely, adverbs of time, of place, of degree, and of manner. Besides these, it is proper to distinguish the particular class of conjunctive adverbs.

===Adverbs of time===

Adverbs of time are those which answer to the question, when? how long? how soon? or how often?

Of time '''present''': as, ''now, yet, today, nowadays, presently, instantly, immediately, straightway, directly, forthwith''.

Of time '''past''': as, ''already, just now, lately, recently, yesterday, formerly, anciently, once, heretofore, hitherto, since, till now, long ago, erewhile, erst''.

Of time '''to come''': as, ''tomorrow, hereafter, henceforth, henceforward, by-and-by, soon, erelong, shortly''.

Of time '''relative''': as, ''when, then, first, just, before, after, while, whilst, meanwhile, as, till, until, seasonably, betimes, early, late, whenever, afterward, afterwards, otherwhile, otherwhiles''.

Of time '''absolute''': as, ''always, ever, never, aye, eternally, forever, perpetually, continually, incessantly, endlessly, evermore, everlastingly''.

Of time '''repeated''': as, ''often, oft, again, occasionally, frequently, sometimes, seldom, rarely, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, annually, once, twice, thrice, or three times''.

Above thrice, we use only the phrases four times, five times, six times, etc. Times, for repetitions, or instances, may be supposed a noun; but such phrases often appear to be used adverbially.

===Adverbs of degree===

Adverbs of degree are those which answer to the question, how much? how little? or to the idea of more or less.

Of '''excess''' or abundance: as, ''much, more, most, too, very, greatly, far, besides; chiefly, principally, mainly, mostly, generally; entirely, full, fully, completely, perfectly, wholly, totally, altogether, all, quite, clear, stark; exceedingly, excessively, extravagantly, intolerably; immeasurably, inconceivably, infinitely''.

Of equality or '''sufficiency''': as, ''enough, sufficiently, competently, adequately, proportionally, equally, so, as, even, just, exactly, precisely''.

Of '''deficiency''' or abatement: as, ''little, less, least, scarcely, hardly, scantly, scantily merely, barely, only, but, partly, partially, nearly, almost, well-nigh, not quite''.

Of quantity in the '''abstract''': as, ''how, however, howsoever, everso, something, anything, nothing, a groat, a sixpence'', and other nouns of quantity used adverbially.

===Adverbs of manner===

Adverbs of manner are those which answer to the question, how? or, by affirming, denying, or doubting, show how a subject is regarded.

Of manner from '''quality''': as, ''well, ill, wisely, foolishly, justly, wickedly'', and many others formed by adding ''ly'' to adjectives of quality.

Of affirmation or '''assent''': as, ''yes, yea, ay, verily, truly, indeed, surely, certainly, doubtless, undoubtedly, assuredly, certes, forsooth, amen''.

Of '''negation''': as, ''no, nay, not, nowise, noway, noways, nohow''.

Of doubt or '''uncertainty''': as, ''perhaps, haply, possibly, perchance, peradventure, maybe''.

Of '''mode''' or way: as, ''thus, so, how, somehow, nohow, anyhow, however, howsoever, like, else, otherwise, across, together, apart, asunder, namely, particularly, necessarily, hesitatingly, trippingly, extempore, headlong, lengthwise''.

===Adverbs of place===

Of place '''in''' which: as, ''where, here, there, yonder, above, below, about, around, somewhere, anywhere, elsewhere, otherwhere, everywhere, nowhere, wherever, wheresoever, within, without, whereabout, whereabouts, hereabout, hereabouts, thereabout, thereabouts''.

Of place '''to''' which: as, ''whither, hither, thither, in, up, down, back, forth, aside, ashore, abroad, aloft, home, homewards, inwards, upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards''.

Of place '''from''' which: as, ''whence, hence, thence, away, out, off, far, remotely''.

Of the '''order''' of place: as, ''first, secondly, thirdly, fourthly'', etc.

Thus, secondly means in the second place; ''thirdly, in the third place''; etc.

===Conjunctive adverbs===

The conjunctive adverbs are those which perform the office of conjunctions.
The following words are the most frequently used as conjunctive
adverbs: ''after, again, also, as, before, besides, consequently, else, ere, even, furthermore, hence, how, however, moreover, nevertheless, as well, otherwise, since, so, still, till, then, thence, therefore, too, until, when, where, wherefore, whither, while''.

The '''adverbs of cause''': ''why, wherefore, therefore''; but the last two of these are often called conjunctions.

The '''pronominal compounds''': ''herein, therein, wherein'', etc.

==A short syntax==

Adverbs relate to verbs, participles, adjectives, or other adverbs: as, &quot;How blessed,&quot; except the following cases: independent adverbs, as &quot;No,&quot; the word ''amen'', as &quot;These things say the amen,&quot; an adverb before preposition, as &quot;All along&quot;, and ''much'', ''little'', ''far'', and ''all'', as &quot;Thus far is right.&quot;

An '''adjective''' is a word added to a noun or pronoun, and generally expresses quality: as, A wise man; a new book; you two are diligent. Adjectives may be divided into six classes; namely, common, proper, numeral, pronominal, participial, and compound.

A '''common''' adjective is any ordinary epithet, or adjective denoting quality or situation: as, ''good, bad, peaceful, warlike, eastern, western, outer, inner''.

A '''proper''' adjective is an adjective formed from a proper name: as, ''American, English, Platonic, Genoese''.

A '''numeral''' adjective is an adjective that expresses a definite number: as, ''one, two, three, four, five, six'', etc.

A '''pronominal''' adjective is a definitive word which may either accompany its noun, or represent it understood: as,

*&quot;All join to guard what each desires to gain.&quot;&amp;mdash;Pope.

That is,

*&quot;All men join to guard what each man desires to gain.&quot;

A '''participial''' adjective is one that has the form of a participle, but differs from it by rejecting the idea of time: as,

*&quot;An amusing story,&quot;
*&quot;A lying divination.&quot;

A '''compound''' adjective is one that consists of two or more words joined together, either by the hyphen or solidly: as, ''nut-brown, laughter-loving, four-footed; threefold, lordlike, lovesick''.

'''Cardinal''': ''one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two'', etc.

'''Ordinal''': ''first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second'', etc.

'''Multiplicative''': ''single or alone, double or twofold, triple or threefold, quadruple or fourfold, quintuple or fivefold, sextuple or sixfold, septuple or sevenfold, octuple or eightfold'', etc.

All that occur above decuple or tenfold, are written with a hyphen, and are usually of round numbers only: as, ''thirty-fold, sixty-fold, hundred-fold''.


==Adjectives ending in ing and ed==

==Adjectives word order==

In English, multiple adjectives should follow a certain pattern as follows:

#opinion (e.g. lovely, fantastic)
#size (e.g. tiny, large)
#most other qualities (e.g. warm, tight)
#age (e.g. new, young)
#colour (e.g. red, beige)
#pattern (e.g. stripy, plain)
#nationality (e.g. Spanish, foreign)
#material (e.g. silk, cotton)

Although you generally shouldn't use more than 2 or 3 adjectives together it is possible to make a sentence like this:

*&quot;I just bought a lovely, large, warm, new, red, stripey, foreign, cotton sweater.&quot;

==Modifications==

Adjectives have, commonly, no modifications but the forms of comparison. Comparison is a variation of the adjective, to express quality in different degrees: as, ''hard, harder, hardest; soft, softer, softest''.

There are three degrees of comparison; the positive, the comparative, and the superlative.

The '''positive degree'' is that which is expressed by the adjective in its simple form: as,

*&quot;An elephant is large; a mouse, small; a lion, fierce, active, bold, and  strong.&quot;

The '''comparative degree''' is that which is more or less than something contrasted with it: as,

*&quot;A whale is larger than an elephant; a mouse is a much smaller animal than a rat.&quot;

The '''superlative degree''' is that which is most or least of all included with it: as,

*&quot;The whale is the largest of the animals that inhabit this globe; the mouse is the smallest of all beasts.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

Those adjectives whose signification does not admit of different degrees, cannot be compared: as, ''two, second, all, every, immortal, infinite''.

Those adjectives which may be varied in sense, but not in form, are compared by means of adverbs: as, ''fruitful, more fruitful, most fruitful; fruitful, less fruitful, least fruitful''.

==Regular comparison==

Adjectives are regularly compared, when the comparative degree is expressed by adding ''er'', and the superlative, by adding ''est'' to them: as, ''great, greater, greatest; mild, milder, mildest''.

In the variation of adjectives, final consonants are doubled, final ''e'' is omitted, and final ''y'' is changed to ''i'', agreeably to the rules for spelling: as, ''hot, hotter, hottest; wide, wider, widest; happy, happier, happiest''.

The regular method of comparison belongs almost exclusively to monosyllables, with dissyllables ending in ''w'' or ''y'', and such others as receive it and still have but one syllable after the accent: as, ''fierce, fiercer, fiercest; narrow, narrower, narrowest; gloomy, gloomier, gloomiest; serene, serener, serenest; noble, nobler, noblest; gentle, gentler, gentlest''.

==Comparison by adverbs==

The two degrees of superiority may also be expressed with precisely the same import as above, by prefixing to the adjective the adverbs ''more'' and ''most'': as, ''wise, more wise, most wise; famous, more famous, most famous; amiable, more amiable, most amiable''.

The degrees of inferiority are expressed, in like manner, by the adverbs ''less'' and ''least'': as, ''wise, less wise, least wise; famous, less famous, least famous; amiable, less amiable, least amiable''. The regular method of comparison has, properly speaking, no degrees of this kind.

Nearly all adjectives that admit of different degrees, may be compared by means of the adverbs; but, for short words, the regular method is generally preferable: as, ''quick, quicker, quickest''; rather than, ''quick, more quick, most quick''.

==Irregular comparison==

The following adjectives are compared irregularly: ''good, better, best; bad, evil, or ill, worse, worst; little, less, least; much, more, most; many, more, most''.

==A short syntax==

Adjectives relate to nouns or pronouns, as &quot;Worldly enjoyments,&quot; except the following cases: an intervening verb, as &quot;To err is human,&quot; arithmetical numbers, as &quot;Four hundred and fifty-six men,&quot; an abstract adjective, as &quot;Being sublime,&quot; and an adjective as abstract noun, as &quot;Sensations of sublime.&quot;

An adjective is placed immediately before noun, as &quot;Vain man,&quot; except the following cases: pronouns, as &quot;They left me weary,&quot; other words, as &quot;A mind conscious of right,&quot; an action, as &quot;Virtue renders life happy,&quot; admiration, as &quot;Goodness infinite,&quot; a verb, as &quot;Truth stands independent,&quot; a prefix ''a'', as afraid, the nature of a participle, as &quot;The time then present,&quot; poetry, as &quot;Isles atlantic,&quot; technical usage, as &quot;Notary public,&quot; an adjective, as &quot;A being infinitely wise,&quot; several adjectives, as &quot;A woman, modest, sensible, and virtuous,&quot; empathy, as &quot;Weighty is the anger,&quot; an adjective in predicate, as &quot;We call the boy good,&quot; and an adjective as adverb, as &quot;Particularly&quot;.

A '''pronoun''' is a word used instead of a noun: as,

*&quot;The boy loves his book; he has long lessons, and he learns them well.&quot;

Pronouns are not a requirement of a sentence, and it is possible for them to never to be used in sentences. However, many sentences become unwieldy without them:

*&quot;Alistair is doing what Alistair thinks is best according to Alistair's rights as a human being.&quot;
*Better, &quot;Alistair is doing what he thinks is best according to his rights as a human being.&quot;

The pronouns in English language are twenty-four; and their variations are thirty-two: so that the number of words of this class, is fifty-six.

Pronouns are divided into three classes; personal, relative, and interrogative.

Pronouns also change depending on whether they refer to one person or thing (singular) or a group of people or things (plural).


==Personal pronouns==

A personal pronoun or '''personal''' is a pronoun that shows, by its form, of what person it is: as,

*&quot;Whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.&quot;&amp;mdash;1 Cor., xv, 11.

The simple personal pronouns are five: namely, ''I'', of the first person; ''you'', of the second person; ''he, she'', and ''it'', of the third person.

The compound personal pronouns are also five: namely, ''myself'', of the first person; ''yourself'', of the second person; ''himself, herself'', and ''itself'', of the third person.

First person pronouns are used when referring to oneself:

*&quot;''I'' think ''I'' am not silly.&quot;

Second person pronouns are used to refer to someone who you are conversing with, the person the sentence is intended to be heard by:

*&quot;''You'' are not very silly.&quot;

Third person pronouns are used when referring to something else that is outside the conversation, either some other person, or an object not capable of understanding or communicating:

*&quot;I don't like the tree because ''it'' is ugly.&quot;
*&quot;I don't like the RIAA because ''they'' sued me.&quot;

Third person singular pronouns are the only pronouns marked for gender. If gender is unknown, use ''he or she'' or use a plural.

==Relative pronouns==

A relative pronoun or '''relative''' is a pronoun that represents an antecedent word or phrase, and connects different clauses of a sentence: as,

*&quot;No people can be great, who have ceased to be virtuous.&quot;&amp;mdash;Dr. Johnson.

The relative pronouns are ''who, which, what, that, as'', and the compounds ''whoever or whosoever, whichever or whichsoever, whatever or whatsoever''.

''What'' is a kind of double relative, equivalent to &quot;that which&quot; or &quot;those which&quot;; and is to be parsed first as antecedent, and then as relative: as,

*&quot;This is what I wanted; that is to say, the thing which I wanted.&quot;&amp;mdash;L. Murray. III.

==Interrogative pronouns==

An interrogative pronoun or '''interrogative''' is a pronoun with which a question is asked: as,

*&quot;Who touched my clothes?&quot;&amp;mdash;Mark, v, 30.

The interrogative pronouns are ''who, which'', and ''what''; being the same in form as relatives.

''Who'' demands a person's name; ''which'', that a person or thing be distinguished from others; ''what'', the name of a thing, or a person's occupation and character.

Pronouns have the same modifications as nouns; namely, persons, numbers, genders, and cases. Definitions universally applicable have already been given of all these things; it is therefore unnecessary to define them again in this place.

The declension of a pronoun is a regular arrangement of its numbers and cases.

==Simple personals==

The simple personal pronouns are thus declined:
&lt;pre&gt;
I, of the first person, any of the genders.

Sing. Nom.  I,             Plur. Nom.  we,
      Poss. my, or mine,         Poss. our, or ours,
      Obj.  me;                  Obj.  us.

You, of the second person, any of the genders.

Nom.  you,
Poss. your, or yours,
Obj.  you.

He, of the third person, masculine gender.

Sing. Nom.  he,            Plur. Nom.  they,
      Poss. his,                 Poss. their, or theirs,
      Obj.  him;                 Obj.  them.

She, of the third person, feminine gender.

Sing. Nom.  she,           Plur. Nom.  they,
      Poss. her, or hers,        Poss. their, or theirs,
      Obj.  her;                 Obj.  them.

It, of the third person, neuter gender.

Sing. Nom,  it,            Plur. Nom.  they,
      Poss. its,                 Poss. their, or theirs,
      Obj.  it;                  Obj.  them.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Compound personals==

The word ''self'', added to the simple personal pronouns, forms the class of compound personal pronouns; which are used when an action reverts upon the agent, and also when some persons are to be distinguished from others. They all want the possessive case, and are alike in the nominative and objective. Thus:
&lt;pre&gt;
Myself, of the first person, any of the genders

Sing. Nom.  myself,   Plur. Nom.  ourselves
      Poss. ------,         Poss. ---------,
      Obj.  myself;         Obj.  ourselves.

Yourself, of the second person, any of the genders.

Sing. Nom.  yourself,
      Poss. --------,
      Obj.  yourself.

Plur. Nom.  yourselves,
      Poss. ----------,
      Obj.  yourselves.

Himself, of the third person, masculine gender.

Sing. Nom.  himself,  Plur. Nom.  themselves,
      Poss. -------,        Poss. ----------,
      Obj.  himself;        Obj.  themselves.

Herself, of the third person, feminine gender.

Sing. Nom.  herself   Plur. Nom.  themselves,
      Poss. -------,        Poss. ----------,
      Obj.  herself;        Obj.  themselves.

Itself, of the third person, neuter gender.

Sing. Nom.  itself,   Plur. Nom.  themselves,
      Poss. ------,         Poss. ----------,
      Obj.  itself;         Obj.  themselves.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Relatives and interrogatives==

The relative and the interrogative pronouns are thus declined:
&lt;pre&gt;
Who, literally applied to persons only.

Sing. Nom.  who,      Plur. Nom.  who,
      Poss. whose,          Poss. whose,
      Obj.  whom;           Obj.  whom.

Which, applied to animals and things.

Sing. Nom.  which,    Plur. Nom.  which,
      Poss. ----,           Poss. -----,
      Obj.  which;          Obj.  which.

What, applied ordinarily to things only.

Sing. Nom.  what,     Plur. Nom.  what,
      Poss. ----,           Poss. ----,
      Obj.  what;           Obj.  what.

That, applied to persons, animals, and things.

Sing. Nom.  that,     Plur. Nom.  that,
      Poss. ----,           Poss. ----,
      Obj.  that;           Obj.  that.

As, applied to persons, animals, and things.

Sing. Nom.     as,    Plur. Nom.  as,
      Poss.    ----,        Poss. ----,
      Obj.     as;          Obj.  as.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Compound relatives==

The compound relative pronouns, ''whoever or whosoever, whichever or whichsoever'', and ''whatever or whatsoever'' are declined in the same manner as the simples. Thus:
&lt;pre&gt;
Whoever or whosoever, applied only to persons.

==Unclear Usage of Pronouns==

Although helpful to eliminate repetitiveness of nouns, pronouns, when used too much, can make a sentence extremely vague: as,

*&quot;Pictures on walls make ''it'' look pretty.&quot;

The reader does not know what ''it'' is.

*&quot;The teachers prepared the food. The students ate it. ''They'' had fun.&quot;

The reader does not know who ''they'' are.

==Y'all==

The pronoun ''y'all'' is a contraction of &quot;You all&quot;.  It is traditionally used in the south of the United States, where in the north you all is more common. ''Y'all'' follows the same conjugation rules as ''they''. Very often it is incorrectly spelled ''ya'll''.

==A short syntax==

A pronoun must agree with its antecedent, as &quot;This is the book; it is excellent,&quot; except the following cases: something indefinite, as &quot;Tell me who it was,&quot; a neuter pronoun, as &quot;I cannot view it,&quot; the pronoun ''it'', as &quot;It is not for kings,&quot; the adjective ''many'', as &quot;Many a great genius, they have no friends,&quot; enallage, as &quot;We shall close our remarks,&quot; another sense, as &quot;Lamps is of the plural number,&quot; nominatives, as &quot;Who are you?&quot;, absolute nominatives, as &quot;It need not be any wonder,&quot; possessives, as &quot;Him whose yoke is easy,&quot; objectives, as &quot;Those whom she persuaded,&quot; neuter verbs, as &quot;Whom did you suppose me to be?&quot;, familiar language, as &quot;The man [whom] I trust,&quot; omission of the relative, as &quot;The worst thing [that] could happen,&quot; a collective noun, as &quot;The council were divided,&quot; the conjunction ''or'', as &quot;James or John will favour us with his company,&quot; the conjunction ''and'', as &quot;Saul and Jonathan were pleasant in their lives,&quot; one person or thing, as &quot;This great philosopher and statesman,&quot; empathy, as &quot;The good man, and the sinner too, shall have his reward,&quot; and ''each'', ''every'', or ''no'', as &quot;Every plant and every tree produces others after its kind.&quot;

why are we teaching scanf. we all know we should never use it
: Should we use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fgets Fgets] instead? It ''does'' terminate after a \n character is found. True, scanf is vulnerable to format string attacks, but in the context of the guide (for beginners) I think scanf is sufficient. --[[User:MithrandirAgain|MithrandirAgain]] ([[User talk:MithrandirAgain|talk]]) 06:04, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

== d and i ==

Noob here... I was curious as to why &quot;d&quot; meant &quot;integer&quot;, so I looked it up, and from what I read (correct me if I am wrong please!), &quot;d&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;i&quot;. &quot;d&quot; literally stands for &quot;decimal&quot; as opposed to &quot;hexadecimal&quot; or &quot;octal&quot;, whereas &quot;i&quot; could be interpreted as being in any base. I feel it would help to make this clear, as chances are that if someone is trying to learn C as opposed to Java, they are trying to understand what is actually going on with the programs they are writing.

== Chapter 14. Pinophyta ==
[[image:Conifers_Sierra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Conifer trees growing above 6000 ft (1800 m) in the Sierra Nevada of California]]

The '''Division Pinophyta''' in the Kingdom Plantae comprises those species of plants that were formerly classified as the &quot;modern&quot; '''gymnosperms''' of the Class Coniferales&amp;mdash;that is the ''conifers''.  Unlike many of the gymnosperm groups covered in the previous chapter, ''pinophytes'' are today still broadly represented on the landscape, forming extensive forests in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.  This does not mean this is a recent  group in the paleontological record. Pinophytes are found as fossils as far back as the Upper Carboniferous (Paleozoic Era).  Thus, it is a very ancient group, but one still having significant ecological importance on the planet.  Pinophytes are mostly evergreen trees (some are shrubs) and many have great commercial value for their wood.

* Reread [[Wikipedia:en:Gymnosperm|Gymnosperm]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Conifer|Conifers]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)

These terms, ''gymnosperm'' and ''conifer'' no longer have standing in modern taxonomic treatments of plants. However, both terms are still widely used, so you should have a grasp of what they mean, and how they fit into the taxonomic terms that have replaced them.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Pinophyta|Division Pinophyta]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included:&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Pinales|Order Pinales]]
***[[Wikipedia:en:Pinaceae|Family Pinaceae]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links to '''''Pinus''''' (pines) and read accounts for each of the ''Pinus'' species&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;br&gt;Be sure to read about and understand each of the following terms: '''softwood''', '''evergreen''', '''pine needle''', '''pine cone''', '''pine nuts''', '''resin''', '''wood pulp''', '''timberline'''
***[[Wikipedia:en:Cupressaceae|Family Cupressaceae]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links to each of the listed genera and read accounts for each species&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;br&gt;Be sure to read about and understand each of the following terms: '''Bald Cypress''', '''cypress knees''', '''Giant Sequoia''', '''redwoods''', '''swamp'''
***[[Wikipedia:en:Taxaceae|Family Taxaceae]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links to each species&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;br&gt;Be sure to read about and understand each of the following terms: '''aril''', '''yew''', '''alkaloid'''

==Evolution of the Gymnosperms==

Gymnosperms are very different from the earliest vascular plants. Gymnosperms have very reduced gametophyte generations- female ovules and male pollen. Many gymnosperms, like the Pinophytes, have secondary growth from a vascular cambium. While tree ferns are tall and have a trunk resembling a tree, they are only very superficially similar. They do not have woody growth the way trees with secondary growth from a vascular cambium do. A single mutation of a fern or a horsetail could not produce a functioning seed plant. So gymnosperms must be descended from some progymnosperm ancestor that evolved these adaptations from the ferns, but was not fit enough to remain on earth. One possible example of a progymnosperm is the spore bearing woody tree [[Wikipedia:en:Archaeopteris|Archaeopteris]], which was at one point probably prevalent on earth.

The following table shows the Spanish words for the four basic 
arithmetics operations:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFF99&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp;
| más  
|-
! &amp;nbsp; - &amp;nbsp;
| menos  
|-
! &amp;nbsp; * &amp;nbsp;
| por  
|-
! &amp;nbsp; / &amp;nbsp;
| entre  
|-
! &amp;nbsp; = &amp;nbsp;
| es/son  
|}

For the equals sign ('''=''') you use '''es''' if the answer is 1, otherwise
you use '''son''':


{| border=&quot;0&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
| ''6-5'': || Seis menos cinco es uno. 
|-
| ''2+2'': || Dos más dos son cuatro.  
|}

== Problemas de matemáticas - ''Math Problems'' ==

Write out as words and then solve the following math problems:

1. ''3 * 3'': ________________________________________

2. ''10 / 2'': ________________________________________

3. ''23 + 42'': ________________________________________

4. ''99 - 9'': ________________________________________

5. ''13 * 7'': ________________________________________

6. ''75 / 3'': ________________________________________

7. ''17 + 4'': ________________________________________

8. ''67 - 66'': ________________________________________

9. ''4 * 25'': ________________________________________

10. ''78 / 13'': ________________________________________

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would say the Baha'i Faith is indeed a religion... look at the wikipedia entry:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%E1%27%ED_Faith Baha'i Faith] --- djKianoosh - 17 May 2005

The Baha'i Faith is a cult.  You may want to be politically correct, but it has so few adherents that it can hardly be called a major religion, at any point in history.  That is what this page is meant for.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 04:00, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

I agree - whether Baha'i is a religion or not is only semantics; it hasn't had a large enough impact on world history to merit inclusion in this summary. --[[User:Lady~Macbeth|Lady~Macbeth]] 6 July 2005 22:15 (UTC)

A look into the Kitab-i-Aqdas (the most holy book of the Baha'i) may give any interested person deep insights into the nature of this faith and is therefore strongly recommended. Please note especially the things that are said about the rights of women. Please mark also: the so-called Universal House of Justice, the highest elected Baha'i administrative and legislative council is considered infallible (like the Pope!) in its decisions. It will become, as the Baha'i believe, the world governement in the future, when the majority of mankind will be Baha'i. Only Baha'i have electional rights in the elections of the Universal House of Justice! No woman may be elected to serve in the Universal House of Justice (so much to equal rights).

This section is supposed to explain how different religions affected history, not act as a crash course on each religion, imo. Perhaps the title is a misnomer, and this section should be moved into other relevant pages (i.e. Christianity -&gt; Later Roman, Middle Ages pages, Islam -&gt; Middle East, etc.)
--[[User:Tai|Tai]]

== Zoroastrianism ==

you guys have forgot about one of the most important religions.
You cant have a history book without Zoroastrianism. In case you dont know what Zoroastrianism is, look it up. It was the first ever monotheistic religion.

== Organization of Page ==

I'm curious. Why organize this page alphabetically? Is this page meant to be like a glossary?  Otherwise, why not organize it chronologically or regionally and then chronologically?  Just curious. [[User:DW5|DW5]] ([[User talk:DW5|talk]])</text>

== Bacaan ''(Reading Comprehension)'' ==

Nama saya Mira. Saya tinggal di bae bersama ayah dan ibu. Saya punya seorang kakak laki-laki. Namanya Anto. Saya juga punya adik perempuan. Namanya Wati. Kakak saya dan adik perempuan saya juga tinggal bersama kami.

Ayah kerja di kantor setiap hari. Ibu tinggal dirumah, memasak makanan untuk kami. Setiap hari, saya, kakak dan adik perempuan saya pergi ke sekolah

Terjemahan ''(Translation):''

My name is Mira I live in bae with my father and mother. I have an older brother. His name is Anto.  I also have a younger sister. Her name is Wati.  My older brother and younger sister also live with us.

Father works at the office everyday.  Mother stays at home, cooking food for us. Every day, myself, my older and younger siblings go to school.

== Kosa Kata ''(Vocabulary)'' ==

* adik = younger (brother/sister)
* ayah = bapak = father
* bersama = with
* hari = day
* ibu = mother
* juga = also / too
* kakak = older (brother/sister)
* kerja = work
* laki-laki = male
* makanan = food
* masak = cook
* perempuan = female
* pergi = go
* punya = have
* rumah = home / house
* sekolah = school
* seorang = one person
* setiap = every
* tinggal(*) = stay / live
* untuk = for

&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The word &quot;tinggal&quot; is a tricky word. If it is used alone (not conjugated), it means to live or to stay. However, if you conjugate it, it means to leave or to die. Many people got confused with this. Think of it from an Indonesian cultural perspective. Many indigenous Indonesians believe that when a person dies, the soul is here to stay.

=== Family Structure ===

* ''Ayah'' is synonymous with ''bapak'', which means ''father''.You can use it interchangeably when referring to a father (or your father).  Note that we call adult males as ''bapak'' for courtesy, but we never call them ''ayah''. The word ''ayah'' is exclusively for the father-child relationship (whether by consanguinity or by law such as a stepfather).

* ''Ibu'' means ''mother''. Here, we don't make any distinction like ''bapak'' / ''ayah''.

* •	Notice from the vocabulary list that Indonesian words for siblings are gender-free.  The word ''&quot;kakak&quot;'' is used to describe an older sibling (older brother or older sister). The word ''&quot;adik&quot;'' is used to describe a younger sibling (younger brother or younger sister). In order to further distinguish the gender, we use gender words, e.g., ''&quot;laki-laki&quot;'' for male or ''&quot;perempuan&quot;'' for female. Other gender-free words are made distinct in a similar fashion.

* Other family members:
** Suami = husband
** Istri = wife
** Anak = child / children
** Kakek = grandpa
** Nenek = grandma
** Paman = uncle
** Bibi = aunt
** Sepupu = cousin
** Keponakan = nephew / niece
** Saudara = brother / sister
** Saudara ipar = (brother/sister)-in-law

== Grammar ==
=== Awalan Me- ''(Me- prefix)'' ===

In the passage, you'll notice the first prefix in Indonesian: ''me-''. It's the most important and commonly used in Indonesian.

When it's combined with verbs like above (masak &amp;rarr; memasak), it means the same as the infinitive form. The only thing is that we emphasize that now the verb is in active form.

Almost all verb can be conjugated using ''me-'', but not all. Unfortunately, in order to know which verbs can go with ''me-'' , you must read a lot. The general rule of thumb is that if the verb is reflexive (i.e. doing it to ourself), it usually can't be conjugated with ''me-''. Even more so, don't think that the sense of reflexivity is the same to that of your language. Below is some words that &lt;b&gt;cannot&lt;/b&gt; be conjugated with ''me-'', unless the meaning changes completely differently:
* tinggal = stay (&amp;rarr; meninggal = to die)
* tidur = sleep
* duduk = sit
* bangun = wake up (&amp;rarr; membangun = to build)
* berdiri = get up
* tawa = laugh

The prefix ''me-'' can also apply to other type of words, such as noun and adjectives. However, the rough goal is still the same: To make an active verb. So, you can ''verbize'' a noun or an adjective. Details on these will be covered later.

Note also that when words are conjugated with ''me-'', the spelling is changed a little bit. The spelling change is called ''inflection''. The inflection depends solely on the first letter of the original word. The rule on how the spelling changes can be viewed here: [[Indonesian/prefix me|Prefix me-]] chapter.

=== Akhiran -an ''(Suffix -an)'' ===

Suffix ''-an'' is to ''nominalize'' a verb. Note the example from the passage: makan &amp;rarr; makanan. Analoguous to the prefix ''me-'', you can virtually ''nominalize'' almost any verb you want using ''-an'' suffix, as long as it makes sense.

Note, however, that the nominalisation of the verb does not correspond with the gerundive form (-ing form) expressing the ''action'' or ''state of action'' like in case of Western languages (i.e. eating), but the ''target'' or ''object'' of said action (i.e. food). You can think of it as &quot;things that do what the verb says&quot;.

Some of the verbs may also function as nouns already. For example: ''tidur'' (= sleep), which can be noun and verb at the same time. In this case, you cannot add ''-an'' suffix on it to make a noun out of it. (Note that the word ''tiduran'' does exist, but the meaning is &quot;to lie down casually&quot;, not &quot;sleep&quot;).

Note also that some words may have dual meanings, like ''bangun'', which may mean ''to wake up'' or ''to build''. Of course, if you add ''-an'' suffix, the second meaning is taken, i.e.:
* Bangun (= build) &amp;rarr; Bangunan (= &quot;things that was built&quot; &amp;rarr; building)

TODO: Load the chapter on suffix -an.

=== Awalan Se- ''(Prefix se-)'' ===

Prefix ''se-'' combined with noun would mean &quot;one of that noun&quot;. In the example above, ''orang'' means ''person''. Therefore, ''seorang'' means ''one person''. In English, ''se + noun'' usually translates into ''a / an''.

The ''se + noun'' word compounds are often used as a measure word, akin to those in Chinese. The measure words can be pretty complex. However, as being mentioned in the previous chapters, ''sebuah'' should be fine for most of the things. You must use ''seorang'' to indicate that the noun is a person, and use ''seekor'' for animals.

TODO: Load the chapter on prefix se-.

=== Grammar Summary ===

A simplified grammar summary for this chapter:
* Me + verb &amp;rarr; active verb
* Verb + an &amp;rarr; noun
* Se + noun &amp;rarr; one of that noun

''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Niederösterreich ist sowohl flächenmäßig als auch nach Einwohnern das größte der neun österreichischen Bundesländer. Sankt Pölten ist die Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich. Der Name St. Pölten geht auf den heiligen Hippolytos zurück, nach dem die Stadt benannt wurde.

Die Altstadt befindet sich dort, wo vom 2. bis zum 4. Jahrhundert die Römerstadt ''Aelium Cetium'' stand. 799 wurde der Ort als &quot;Treisma&quot; erwähnt. Das Marktrecht erhielt St. Pölten um 1050, zur Stadt erhoben wurde es 1159. Bis 1494 stand St. Pölten im Besitz des Bistums Passau, dann wurde es landesfürstliches Eigentum. Bereits 771 findet sich ein Benediktinerkloster, ab 1081 gab es Augustiner-Chorherren, 1784 wurde deren Kollegiatsstift aufgehoben, das Gebäude dient seit 1785 als Bischofssitz. Zur Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich wurde St. Pölten mit Landtagsbeschluss vom 10. Juli 1986, seit 1997 ist es Sitz der Niederösterreichischen Landesregierung.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This seems to be an exciting project. But if we're ever going to build up a useful resource in science, people should add references to their work. At least if this information should ever be used for academic purpose - which I have very strong doubts about. - [http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mendalus Mendalus]
: If people are using external references - I'm sure they'll add it. Most of us are writing texts from our own knowledge (so we own the copyright to the material - see [[en:Wikipedia:Copyrights]] - we fall under the same licensing). [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:34, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:: By academic standards - which this project need to follow if they're ever going to be used for academic purposes - you try to look up references (mainly published scientific articles) even though you write out of your own knowledge. :) If you've got a textbook in a subject, take a look at the references given there. You do not infringe any copyrights by using some of those references. Anyways, you're doing a great job!

Well yes, but most textbooks put a bibliography at then end of the book, not as they go along. Remember these are textbooks not scientific papers [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 16:05, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

==Medical wiki==

Don't want to spoil anybody's plans here but I have been maintaining a separate wiki for medicine the past few months now. You can see it here. [http://mednotes.net Mednotes.net] [http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Weiming Weiming] --[[User:82.35.40.201|82.35.40.201]] 23:02, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)
: Note:  This is not really &quot;spoiling&quot; anything.  Wikibooks is a good way to help collect information, and certainly Wikibooks could be a mirror/fork of a project that is done elsewhere... particularly if it is released with a copyright license that is compatable with the GFDL.  There are some high school science textbooks that are being done exactly this way.  An advantage to having the content here is that you don't have to maintain the server, and it is likely that this server will be around for a few years, as opposed to a private server.  [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 3 July 2005 11:12 (UTC)

== Medicine as a separate bookshelf ==

I think Medicine is too vast a subject and too heavy to be listed in the Science bookshelf. It is more appropriate that this bookshelf is listed independently. This is not to say it does not belong to &lt;tt&gt;Science&lt;/tt&gt;. It invariably does but it deserves a separate, independent category of its own!!

[[User:Bduttabaruah|BDB]] 08:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

== QUESTION ==

Are wikibooks ever finished?? like do they close to edits?

==Rename entry for Ethology in bookshelf==
I have been working on the [[Animal Behavior|Animal Behavior Book]] for some time. On the book shelf it is listed as the much more restrictive term ethology, which automatically redirects to - animal behavior. Would somebody in the know be so kind to rename the entry in the book shelf so it is directly listed as [[Animal Behavior]] instead of ethology?
[[User:Robert Huber|Robert Huber]] 18:33, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

: {{done}}. Darklama fixed it in the {{tl|Biology bookshelf}} template, which is transcluded here -- I don't see any mention of &quot;ethology&quot; now. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:04, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

== New textbook: [[Chemical Principles]] ==
I am nearly halfway finished creating a textbook for first-year college students called [[Chemical Principles]].  It is based on a traditional textbook of the same title and is used with the explicit written permission of the authors (Dickerson, Gray and Haight).  Can someone please tell me
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get the text linked to the Natural Sciences and Chemistry pages, along with the other Chemistry textbooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get authorized to review/approve the pages (as my students are entering information)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Thanks. [[User:wight|Chuck Wight]] 20:01, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

Diphthongs:
*Ae is pronounced as a long 'i'.
*Oe is pronounced as a short 'i'.

Digraphs:
*Ph is pronounced as an aspirated 'p', like ph in 'tophat'. It is equivalent to the Greek letter φ 'phi'. *Often, however, it is just pronounced 'f' as in fat'.
*Th is pronounced as an aspirated 't', like th in rat hall'. It is equivalent to the Greek letter θ 'theta'. *Often, however, it is just pronounced 'th' as in 'threat'.
*Qu is pronounced 'kw' like in English.

*Y is pronounced 'u' as in put. It is equivalent to the Greek letter υ 'upsilon'.
*J, a form of consonantal i used in Medieval Latin texts, is pronounced like a 'y'. Similarly, i, when is used as a consonant, is pronounced with a 'y' sound.

*C is always pronounced hard (velar [k] - as in English 'cat'), even when it follows an 'e' or 'i'.  It is never pronounced as English 'c' in 'cell'. 

*G is always pronounced hard (velar [g] - as in English 'go'), even following 'e' and 'i'.  It is never pronounced as in English 'gel'.

*R was probably trilled or tapped, closer to modern Italian than to English.  

*Classical latin texts used only capital letters, and the same letter, 'V', was used for what are now spelt as 'u' and 'v' in most texts.  This is still reflected in some modern Latin texts, where a capital 'u' is spelt 'V'.  When used as a consonant, 'V' was pronounced much like English 'w'.

b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, q, s, t, x, and z are pronounced as they are normally pronounced in English.

Trying to describe a noun is hard! Words are just text labels for objects, concepts, actions, attributes, or simply &quot;things&quot; which fulfil certain functions within the languages which use them. Nouns are words which are associated with physical objects, or with abstract concepts, or with the names of people or objects or concepts.

I am not sure that it is OK to say that &quot;Nouns are just names&quot;!

Further, I do wonder whether it makes sense to do this section without using images. Mention is made of a chair, but this does not make sense to anyone who does not already know a word for chair, or who has not seen a chair or used one. [[User:David Martland|David Martland]] 11:06, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I copied the exercises here, this article is already much too long. Adding the whole Wikipedia article on plurals there made it a mess. Perhaps the articles should be in a separate article, as a long article with many exercises in the middle is almost impossible to follow. [[User:Tkorrovi|Tkorrovi]] ([[User talk:Tkorrovi|talk]]) 15:39, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

== Audio Recording ==

Speaking from personal experience from learning foreign languages, it is really useful to have an AUDIO recording of the pronunciation of the various sounds in a language.

Having approximations like &quot;'A' as in 'father'&quot; etc. is all very well, but it really is no substitute for hearing a native make the sound and then replicating it. Written words are subject to the variances of dialect and accent- for example while &quot;Pen&quot; might be pronounced &quot;Pehn&quot; in the UK and USA, in New Zealand it is pronounced &quot;Piin&quot;. Reliance on written approximations of a sound is thus quite dangerous and restrictive for a self-learner of a language. 

If you think about it, the reason books used these approximations back in the day, was that it was a &lt;u&gt;BOOK&lt;/u&gt; BACK IN THE DAY. It's 2009 for freaks sake- on the internet!! The ability to integrate audio into the learning of a language is a marvellous opportunity that we should capitalise on! The old book format of self-learning was subject to the technological limitations of yesteryear. We should be availing of the ease of audio integration that is at our disposal to provide a dynamic language learning experience.

I therefore '''request that a native record each sound''': perhaps saying the sound alone, then in a word, repeated, and then as a sound alone again. This could easily be inserted as an mp3 beside each individual sound. It will only really take about an hour's work or so and would REALLY contribute to learning that the wikibook seeks to provide!

All the best,
Jack

== Ch, Ll, Ñ ==

While Ch and Ll have now been added to &quot;c&quot; and &quot;l&quot; in the ''Real Academia Española'' dictionaries and other dictionaries, keep in mind that in '''ALL''' the Spanish-Spanish dictionaries, ''Ñ/ñ'' is a letter by its own, and hasn't (nor has a reason to) been eliminated from the order of ''M, N, Ñ, O'' in the dictionaries.

== Common pronunciation of Ll ==

Is the 'proper' pronunciation of ll as 'gl' like in Italian actually exist in the Spanish-speaking world?  It seems it exists solely academically.

More to the point, while the 'll' is often pronounced like the 'y' in English, in many areas it is actually closer to the 'zh' sound and, notably in many parts of Argentina, quite nearly the English 'sh' sound.  Anecdotally, I have used both the 'y' and the 'zh' versions and have never had it questioned, even by academics.  I believe the fair student can stick with either of these and avoid the unusual sounding 'gl'.  Just an opinion.

[[User:156.56.73.196|156.56.73.196]] 18:00, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
*I removed the whole &quot;properly&quot; nonsense. There are numerous proper ways to say the letter ll. Castilian Spanish is not any more &quot;proper&quot;.

==Hablan==
it says that hablan is pronounced HA- BLAN not A- BLAN like it should be [[User:144.138.190.1|144.138.190.1]] 07:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
*huh? Hablan is pronounced AH-blahn, with emphasis on the first syllable. This is the rule of stress for words ending in the letter N but that do not have an accent to signify stress.

== alignment on page 5 ==

The left and right columns have their &quot;middle&quot; aligned. This is confusing. They should have their TOP aligned.Š

== d, touching teeth ==

&quot;Between vowels, the tongue should be lowered so as to not touch the teeth (somewhat similar to the ''th'' in ''the'').&quot;

But the tongue '''does''' touch the teeth in ''the'', in English - could this please be clarified? --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] ([[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]]) 17:55, 5 August 2008 (UTC)


==N==
&quot;Like n in no. Before '''p, b,''' f and v (and in some regions m) sounds as m in important...&quot; never write n before a B or a P, always, mp and mb
'''Bold text'''

== What is &quot;over-cultism&quot;? ==

The section on the letter 'v' states that pronouncing 'v' like 'v' instead of 'b' is an 'over-cultism'. An internet search sheds absolutely no light on the meaning of this phrase. Curious students who doubt the veracity of this wiki page (because anyone can edit it) will wonder if the phrase 'over-cultism' might mean something along the lines of being a widely held belief thoroughly known to be wrong to those in the know. No one can be sure though. Is it a neologism? If 'over-cultism' is synonymous with 'common misconception', that might be a better word choice.

For me, a beginner, it seems possible that v is a sort of cross between an English v and b, with at least a different mouth shape from a Spanish 'b'. Does it vary region to region, or is it really so absolute?

== About Spanish &quot;Q&quot; ==

On this page it says that &quot;qu&quot; can substitute &quot;cu&quot; before &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot;. Is this true, and how common is it?</text>

The '''Domain Name System''', most often known as simply '''DNS''', is a core feature of the [[Internet]]. It is a distributed database that handles the mapping between host names ('''domain names'''), which are more convenient for humans, and the numerical [[Wikipedia:IP_address|Internet addresses]]. For example, ''www.wikipedia.org'' is a domain name and ''130.94.122.199'' the corresponding numerical internet address. The domain name system acts much like an automated phone book, so you can &quot;call&quot; ''www.wikipedia.org'' instead of ''130.94.122.199''. So, it converts human-friendly names such as &quot;www.wikipedia.org&quot; into computer-friendly (IP) addresses such as 130.94.122.199. It can also handle the reverse mapping, meaning that we can query for a name for ''130.94.122.199'', that return ''larousse.wikipedia.org''

DNS was first invented in 1983 by [[Wikipedia:Paul_Mockapetris|Paul Mockapetris]]; the original specifications are described in [[Wikipedia:RFC|RFC]] 882.  In 1987 RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 were published which updated the DNS specifcation and made RFC 882 and RFC 883 obsolete.  Subsequent to that there have been quite a few RFCs published that propose various extensions to the core protocols.

DNS implements a hierarchical name space by allowing name service for parts of a name space known as zones to be &quot;delegated&quot; by a [[Wikipedia:Name_server|name server]] to subsidiary name-servers. DNS also provides additional information, such as alias names for systems, contact information, and which hosts act as mail hubs for groups of systems or domains.

The present restriction on the length of domain names is 63 characters, excluding the ''www.'' and ''.com'' or other extension. Domain names are also limited to a subset of [[Wikipedia:ASCII |ASCII]] characters, preventing many languages from representing their names and words correctly. The [[Wikipedia:Punycode|Punycode]]-based [[Wikipedia:IDNA|IDNA]] system, which maps [[Wikipedia:Unicode |Unicode]] strings into the valid DNS character set, has been approved by [[Wikipedia:ICANN|ICANN]] and adopted by some [[Wikipedia:domain_name_registry|registries]] as a workaround.

The DNS system is run by various flavors of DNS software, including:

* [[Wikipedia:BIND|BIND]] (Berkeley Internet Name Domain), the most commonly used namedaemon.
* [[Wikipedia:DJBDNS|DJBDNS]] (Dan J Bernstein's DNS implementation)
* [[Wikipedia:MaraDNS|MaraDNS]]
* [[Wikipedia:NSD|NSD]] (Name Server Daemon)
* [[Wikipedia:PowerDNS|PowerDNS]]

Any [[Wikipedia:Internet protocol|IP]] computer network can use DNS to implement its own private name system. However, the term &quot;domain name&quot; is most commonly used to refer to domain names implemented in the public [[Wikipedia:Internet|Internet]] DNS system. This is based on thirteen &quot;root servers&quot; worldwide, all but three of which are in the [[Wikipedia:United_States_of_America|United States of America]]. From these thirteen [[Wikipedia:root_nameserver|root servers]], the rest of the Internet DNS name space is delegated to other DNS servers which serve names within specific parts of the DNS name space.

An 'owner' of a domain name can be found by looking in the [[Wikipedia:whois|WHOIS]] database: for most TLDs a basic WHOIS is held by ICANN, with the detailed WHOIS maintained by the domain registry which controlls that domain. For the 240+ Country Code TLDs the position is usually that the registry holds the entire authorative WHOIS for that extension, as part of their many functions.

The current way the main DNS system is controlled is often criticized. The most common problems pointed at are that it is abused by monopolies or near-monopolies such as [[Wikipedia:VeriSign|VeriSign]] Inc., and problems with assignment of [[Wikipedia:top-level_domain|top-level domain]]s. 

Some also allege that many implementations of DNS server software fail to work gracefully with dynamically allocated IP addresses, although that is the failure of specific implementations and not failures of the protocol itself.

DNS uses [[Wikipedia:Transmission_Control_Protocol|TCP]] and [[Wikipedia:User_Datagram_Protocol|UDP]] [[Wikipedia:computer_port|port]] 53.  Most DNS queries (such as name resolution requests) use UDP connections as the amount of data transferred is small and the session establishment overhead would introduce unnecessary traffic and load on nameservers.  DNS zone file transfers between nameserver peers use TCP connections as the volume of data transferred is potentially much larger.

A DNS domain definition (sometimes referred to as a 'zone file') consists of individual DNS records.  There are several record types in common usage:
* '''SOA''' or Start Of Authority records contain parameters for the domain definition itself.
* '''A''' records resolve names into an IP addresses
* '''PTR''' records resolve IP addresses to names
* '''NS''' records define the authoritative nameservers for the domain.
* '''CNAME''' or Canonical Name records allow aliasing of one name to another.
* '''MX''' or Mail Exchange records define the mail server associated with a domain or A record.
* '''HINFO''' or Hardware Information records can be used to hold descriptive text about a specific device.

Virtually all modern operating systems and network applications contain resolved libraries or routines for interrogating DNS services.  However, OSs generally provide a command line interface for querying DNS servers.  The Windows NT family of operating systems provides the 'nslookup' command.  Unix-based operating systems may also offer 'nslookup' or 'dig' tools.

'''nslookup''' can either be used interactively, or non-interactively.  An example of non-interactive usage follows.  In this example, we gather the A record for www.wikipedia.org from the client's default nameserver:

''nslookup www.wikipedia.org''

Nslookup is somewhat more powerful when used interactively.  An example of this follows.  In the example, we find the mail servers for the domain wikipedia.org:

''nslookup''

''&gt; set q=MX''

''&gt; wikipedia.org''

''Non-authoritative answer:''

''wikipedia.org   MX preference = 50, mail exchanger = mormo.org''

''wikipedia.org   MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = mail.wikimedia.org''

''&gt;''

There are many resources available on the net that are in the [[w:public domain|public domain]], and therefore freely usable without restrictions for Wikimedia universe (this includes Wikibooks) content. 

There are also many [[w:copyright|copyright]]ed resources whose licensing terms are liberal enough that they can generally be used as well. For these, see [[w:Wikipedia:Free or semi-free non-Public-Domain information resources|free or semi-free non-Public-Domain information resources]] and [[w:Wikipedia:GNU Free Documentation License resources|GNU Free Documentation license resources]] (includes images).

This page is intended as a list of only true public domain text resources. For public domain images, see [[w:Wikipedia:Public domain image resources|public domain image resources]].

'''CAVEAT''': Because there is no concept of [[w:public domain|public domain]] in [[w:Japan's copyright law|Japan's copyright law]], even though the materials are claimed public domain, there can be some restrictions such as about commercial use, which has a conflict with [[m:GFDL|GFDL]]. Also, unlike the United States, most English speaking commonwealth countries exert [[m:Crown copyright|Crown copyright]]. Please make certain that in any particular jurisdiction government agencies will allow you to copy materials without permission.

India government sites also seem to be copyright by default.  Quoting from [http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/login/userAgreement.htm]: ''Unless otherwise stated, copyright and all intellectual property rights in all material presented on the site (including but not limited to text, audio, video or graphical images), trademarks and logos appearing on this site are the property of Government of Maharashtra and are protected under applicable Indian laws. Any infringement shall be vigorously defended and pursued to the fullest extent permitted by law.''

== Please don't data dump! ==

The resources below are valuable, but many are very old, context-dependent, written from biased points of view, and otherwise are not ''in themselves'' good encyclopedia articles. The [[w:1911 encyclopedia|1911 encyclopedia]] discussed below is a good example of this - it contains some useful information, but also antiquated writing style and innumerable errors of fact. 

So please, if you copy material from these sources, make sure you take some time to verify the actuality of the information, edit, '''update''', introduce, or otherwise produce a good article out of it rather than just [[wiktionary:dump|dump]]ing it here verbatim. But if you can't do that, put it in anyway because somebody else will come by and tweak it.  Wikibooks books are living texts, because everybody has the power to edit them.  An entry that starts out incorrect, as a stub or even as something very inane will eventually be tweaked and evolve into something much more sophisticated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Q1 The white areas are left neutral.

Q2 When the electrons absorb the light, they get a little bit of extra energy. It is this increase in energy that allows them to escape to earth.

Q3  The toner is given a negative charge so that it is attracted to the positively charged plate.

Q4 The paper attracts the toner because it is positively charged. Note that the charge on the paper is stronger than the charge on the plate, so although the toner is still attracted to the plate, it is attracted to the paper even more.

Q5 negative

Q6 less paint falls on the floor becaue more is being attracted to the car. Remember: Unlike charges attract.

*&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;These are not used nearly as casually in Hindi and Urdu as they are in western languages. कृपया especially is used only in cases of true importance or urgency, and using it otherwise would sound incredibly stilted and formal. Instead, politeness is achieved by proper address and verb forms and body language/tone of voice.
&lt;!-- A problem I came into, is that Hindi and Urdu don’t use 'please', 'excuse me', 'thank you', or even 'sorry' in the same casual, polite manner as other languages. As “common” phrases, they really don’t belong here at all, nor, even possibly, the formal namaskaar; but I erred on the cautious side, choosing to conform to the rest of the page. --&gt;

== Actions ==

* To make a phone call: PHONE KAR-NAA.&lt;BR&gt;

Hindi uses two forms of address. One is honoring and the other is common.
'''Honoring address''' is used when talking to first acquaintances, unfamiliar people, and to elders (relations and age)....  Examples include
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where are you? =&gt; aap kahan hain 
&lt;li&gt;What is your name? =&gt; aapka naam kya hai , aapka naam jaan sakta hoon?
&lt;li&gt;Please have a seat. =&gt; kripya baithiye, virajiye
&lt;/ol&gt;
The common type of address is used with friends and those of the same age group with whom one is familiar....  Examples include
&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Where are you? =&gt; kahan ho?
&lt;li&gt;What is your name? =&gt; tumhara naam kya hai, 
&lt;li&gt;Have a seat. =&gt; baitho, baith. &lt;/ol&gt;

For Hindi learners, it is better to stick to the first type of address.

Hindi speakers normally use 'namaste' or 'namaskar' for all occasions (meaning good morning/afternoon/day/evening/night) especially with honorific use. Although these may also be used in pure Hindi:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;good morning =&gt; su-pra-bhaa't
&lt;li&gt;good evening =&gt; shubh-sun-dhyaa
&lt;li&gt;good night =&gt; shubh raat-ri&lt;/ul&gt;

Removed bad german from the intro.
Set ''das Rechnen'' instead of ''das Rechnungs'', although ''das Rechnungswesen'' would translate better into 'accounting' but is a compounded noun itself and would be confusing here.&lt;br&gt;
'kennen lernen'/'kennenzulernen' actually mean the same, while the second form is an extension (erweiterter Infitiv mit 'zu').
:Thanks. Any help with German as really spoken is welcome here. Das Rechnungs comes from [http://dict.leo.org/ LEO] which gives ''das Rechnungs'' as &quot;accounting&quot; and Rechnens as &quot;calculation&quot; - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:21, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)

''Rechnungswesen'' is a bit obscure, I don't know if it really exists. The simple ''Buchhaltung'' might be better. I'd change it right away if it wasn't used as an example :) --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 14:23, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Don't worry about making changes (as you suggest). I will see that a change has been made and readjust the lesson accordingly. Providing a reason on the talk page or in the &quot;summary&quot; is very helpful; but you need not (you can of course) make adjustments to other parts of the lesson - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 19:02, 6 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Problem in 1A, states &quot;Mark removes '''a''' Book&quot;, answer states &quot;Markus holt '''das''' Buch&quot;.
Question and Answer, need to have either definate or indefinate article for Book. I changed the question, to make it more in line with the example.--[[User:Bielenberg|Bielenberg]] 14:18, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

== Grammatik 2-6 ~ Personal Pronouns: nominative case ==

Regarding [[German/Level III/Gespräche Unter Geschäftsmännern#Grammatik 2-6 ~ Personal Pronouns: nominative case | the example sentence ''Du bist ein Schwein!'']], isn't the term ''Schwein'' a profoundly vile insult these days? I'm wondering whether or not there should be a note as to its usage (so as not to give the impression that it's a term that can be bandied about), or if it should be replaced by something more conversational?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Newton's Second Law=
== Momentum ==
A motion of a body is described by its momentum. '''Momentum''' is the '''product''' of a body's '''mass''' and its '''velocity'''. Momentum has both ''magnitude'' and ''direction''. Newton showed that '''bodies only change their motion when a force is applied''', Newtons first law. The change in the momentum is equal to the applied force.

== Derivation of Newton's second law ==
Consider a snooker ball of mass ''m'' moving with a velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The ball hits the cushion and bounces off, it now has a velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The change in momentum is ''mv''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''mv''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
The change in velocity is the acceleration, and so the change in momentum and hence force ''F'' is mass times acceleration, ''F'' = ''ma''.
Thus Action and Reaction are equal but opposite in direction.

== Pushing a car ==
Have you ever helped to push start a car? The hardest part is getting the car to move, but once it is rolling it takes much less effort, (especially if it is on a hill rolling down). To change the velocity of an object we have to do work on it.This means we have to supply energy to it. Once an object is moving it requires no further work, to keep it moving. Objects only slow down in everyday life because of friction forces which do work on the object.
To do work on an object you have to apply a force to it, the amount of work you do depends on the acceleration of the object. Consider pushing a car quickly versus slowly. Pushing a car quickly requires more work.

The rate of change in an objects velocity with respect to time is its acceleration.

When you do work to push start a car, your energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of the car. When objects go faster they have more kinetic energy. We can slow an object down by removing energy from it. For instance if we use a spinning wheel to drive machinery, such as a generator, it will slow down as the energy is transferred to the generator and converted to electricity.

Wikipediaも方向が定まってないのにこんなことを、と思われるかもしれませんがはじめはこんなもので、地道にやるしかないとおもっていて、ほんのり準備だけでもしようかと。もし間違って足を踏み入れたらぜひ[[User talk:Suisui|トークページ]]で声をかけてください。よろしくお願いします。

とりあえず誰もいないのでおもいついたことを思いつくままにここにかきためて、たまに整理します。

== ==
よくわかっていないものの翻訳を開始。
プロジェクト関係の文章はほとんどmetaからのコピーで同一。
日本語版のWikipediaの文章はいまのmetaよりも古いものを翻訳していてつかえない。逆にこっちで翻訳して持ち込むほうがシンプルになりそう。

* 新規参加者～とか、新しい記事の作り方は訳しなおし
* 編集の仕方、はpediaのをつかえる。
* プロジェクトについてはもちろん新規
* おそらく多言語展開をしてからのためだと思うがページごとにスキンを分けたりはできないか。Edit this pageとか、ノート(talk page）を今のまま作り続けるとそのうちダメなのかもしれない。名前空間の多言語化はどこかで議論があった。
しばらくは参加者もいないだろうし。のんびりと[[User:Suisui|Suisui]] 20:37, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)

昨日書き忘れたがこと
* 日本語ではTextbookStandardがおそらく大問題。Netの検索ではまともなものを見つけることはできず、書籍の検索でも論文の書き方はあったけど教科書の書き方というのはないようだ。
* ただし、英語のTextbookStandardは日本で言う論文の書き方にかなり近いものなので、そう問題もないかも。ただ、freeなものが出回っていない
* 教科書だと、縦書きとかを心配したほうがいいのかもしれない。

----
=== 日本語独自 ===
思いつきのメモ

それなりに人がきているウィキペディアですら日本の文化に関するところまでまだ手がついていないが、教科書系だといろんなものがいきなりあっても良いように思う。
* 書道 - 茶道 - 華道
* 剣術 - 武道
* 和歌 - 俳句 - 短歌
* 仏像、城、和傘、伝統工芸マニュアルもよい・・・のか？いまいち不明。

普通に学校で習うものだけでなく、単純に国や文化やマナーの紹介系もあると面白い気がする
* 日本の祝祭日と四季の行事
** 正月、成人式、七草粥、鏡開き、節分、ひな祭り、エイプリルフール、こどもの日、菖蒲湯、ゆず湯、年越しそば
*** wikipediaのほうがいいのか、その辺が良くわからない。

教育制度の違い、近年激しく動いている教育制度などを考えると普通の教科書タイプはやはり無理。各項目ごとに作るしかないと思われる。数学とか、特に。

== おもいつき ==
* WikiUはテストとかも含める？
** 漢字テストとか、単語テストとか、そういうのはどうなるのか。
*** 小学校レベルの漢字練習張とか・・・英語圏にはなさそうだし。
* 必勝の暗記法
* 速読
* 英語版にもない楽器の演奏法、音楽関係
** musixtexは取り込まれないのかな
** その前にAMUかChemかもしれない。</text>

== Big Cats Wikijunior ==

Where is the discussion surrounding the December 10th deadline for Big Cats to be up-to-code? Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:47, 6 December 2005 (UTC)
: On the original proposal to the Beck Foundation (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior/proposal_to_Beck_Foundation), we said it would be printed by December 2005. All good printers likely have a backlog of jobs, because they're so in demand. Plus, I have to preflight the file to make sure it will print. So, sooner is better than later.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

::Well, thanks for the response. So what is going to happen to the Solar System book? I thought that that book was going to be the first to print. Maybe I read that wrong somewhere. Anyway, do we even know who is going to be doing the printing or distributing? Do we have any of the processes in place to actually make this happen, or is this just something you noticed and decided to act upon? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

:::That was discussed at [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/Archive 2]].  I think it'd be a way better idea to publish Solar System first, but unforunately our grant proposal for some reason explicitly says that our first one will be on animals.  Not sure if they'd really hold us to that or not.  Anyone know who is actually in communication with the Beck Foundation?  &amp;mdash; [[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 20:36, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

==Example chapter==

You wrote:

&quot;Shall I do up an example of a chapter of the US Constitution and Government textbook? Just thought I'd mention that Cafepress would be our best choice, because they print of demand. That way, if it sinks, it doesn't hurt anyone's pocketbook.&quot;

Excellent idea.  It is actually quite easy to do the whole book. I have just finished &quot;Consciousness Studies&quot;. See:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/b/bb/Consciousness_studies.pdf

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies/Print_version



This was how I did it:

:I made the print version then viewed and saved it. I opened this file in MS Word and saved it once more in Word format. This allowed Word to set the pagination, produce a TOC etc. The document &quot;read&quot; differently as a whole book so I did some final edits and juggled with the image placements. I then downloaded PDFCreator and printed the Word document to PDF. This preserved the page breaks, which are the big problem with the HTML original whether printed direct or converted to PDF and printed.

どうもです。これをやって次にwikisourceだ、とおもっていたらnanshuさんがやってくれたようです。ウィキメディア、sourcefoge、あとwikitravel（笑）などやりたいところは多々ありますね。ウィキメディアも日本語を載せたいところはいろいろありますよね。でもあちらはどこに日本語版おいていいのかわからなかったので、見てすぐわかったここから手をつけました。プロジェクト関係のものはwikipediaに反映しようと思っています。ここはしばらく放置でしょうからのんびり、時々やります。[[User:Suisui|Suisui]] 19:23, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== [[User:Aram Pitts]] ==

I am writing to you because you blocked this vandal only for a week, although his edits made it obvious, that it's a vandalism-only account. After this week he came back and started to vandalise more pages.

You cannot do such things. The only valid way to deal with users making such edits is to block them infinitely. One week block is something an admin can give for insulting other user, not for mass destruction of project pages! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:59, 12 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{wiktionary|Category:French slang}}

==Notes on how to use slang==
===Foreign speakers===
It is important to note that, as a foreigner, your use of slang will often be received as cute or funny, depending greatly upon your overall fluency in spoken French. To understand this, think about how it would sound to you if a foreigner&amp;mdash;with a strong accent and odd rhythm of speech&amp;mdash;came up to you and said &quot;Dude, what a sketchy-ass hater that bizz-natch was, I totally was just like 'fuck off fo-sheezy'&quot;. Therefore, no matter how much slang you use in your native language, limiting your use of slang in French (proportionally to your level of fluency) will also limit how much you are patronised and giggled at by native listeners.

===Slang: consistency &amp; style=== 
To use slang efficiently, it is important to maintain a consistency of style. Mixing styles might sound like saying: &quot;Thy face, it is quite finely rawkin'&quot;.
*Avoid ''vous'' unless a plural is necessary.
*Avoid subject-verb inversion in questions. Use rather question formations where there is no inversion or 'est-ce que', only the raised tone at the end of the sentence. When doing this with interrogatives (''qui'', ''quand'', ''comment'', etc.), place them at the end of the sentence; i.e. &quot;On va bouffer quand ?&quot;

===Translating 'fuck'=== 
The English-language term 'fuck' is exceptional as it can serve as noun, verb, adjective, exclamation, and others. There is no such equivalent usage of any word in the French language, apart from 'putain', wich can be used as adjective and exclamation, &quot;That's a fucking good car&quot; = &quot;C'est une putain de bonne voiture&quot;. Therefore the translation of 'fuck' into French depends on the corresponding part of speech. 

====Examples====
; noun : &quot;He's a great fuck&quot; = &quot;C'est un bon coup&quot;
: &quot;He is such a fuck(er)&quot; = &quot;C'est un pauvre type/enfoiré/enculé/connard/salaud&quot; (insert any insult)
: &quot;He's such a fuck-up&quot; = &quot;C'est un pauvre con/un raté/un loser&quot;

; verb : sexual: ''baiser, niquer, coucher avec'' ; insulting: ''foutre, enculer''
: &quot;I fucked up on my French test&quot; = &quot;J'ai foiré/raté mon examen de français&quot;
: &quot;I fucked (up) my car&quot; = &quot;J'ai niqué ma bagnole&quot;
: &quot;He fucked me over&quot; = &quot;Il m'a planté&quot;
: &quot;I fucked your mother/mum/mam/mom&quot; = &quot;J'ai baisé/niqué ta mère&quot;
: &quot;Fuck off&quot; = &quot;Va chier!&quot;, &quot;Fous le camp&quot;, &quot;Dégage !&quot; (see the verb 'Foutre')
: &quot;Fuck you&quot;/&quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; = &quot;Va te faire foutre/enculer&quot;

; adjective : &quot;This is fucking awful&quot; = &quot;Putain, ça craint&quot;/&quot;C'est bordelique&quot;/&quot;C'est de la merde&quot;
: &quot;I am so fucked-up&quot; = &quot;Je suis barré/perché&quot; (mental state); &quot;Je suis totalement bourré(e)&quot; (drunk); &quot;Je suis défoncé(e)&quot; (high[marijuana])
: &quot;I don't give a fuck.&quot; = &quot;Je m'en fous&quot;

; adverb : &quot;I am trying to fucking work here&quot; = &quot;J'essaie de bosser putain&quot;

; exclamation : &quot;Fuck!&quot; = &quot;Merde !&quot; ; &quot;Putain !&quot; ; &quot;Bordel !&quot;
: n.b.: these can also be compounded in French, i.e., &quot;Putain de merde !&quot; &quot;Putain de bordel de merde&quot;   (for stringing these together, see the scene in the film Matrix Reloaded with the Frenchman (Merovingian) in the restaurant)

==Glossary==
 Notes on Pronunciation:&lt;br&gt;*To feel how R should be pronounced, gargle with water, then try gargling without water.&lt;br&gt;That is what your throat should be doing when pronouncing the R.&lt;br&gt;*The U is hardest for English speakers. The back of the throat should be stretched out as if you see&lt;br&gt;a mouse and are saying &quot;eee!&quot;, but the lips should be in a tight circle as if you are saying &quot;ooo&quot;.

==Verlan==
Verlan is roughly similar to English Pig Latin, in that certain words are split in half, and the two componenents switch positions, but do not necessarily retain all letters (due to French pronunciation patterns). For example, if you have word [12], in verlan it will become [2-1]. The word ''verlan'' is in itself an example of this; it comes from the word ''l'envers'' (meaning 'backwards'). Verlan is, unlike Pig Latin, quite commonly used among young adults and even adults.  Common verlan expressions include:

; Beur ou rebeu : n., A person of Arab descent. from ''arabe''. ('Beur' is so commonly used that it now has its own Verlan form, 'reub').

; Chelou : adj., Fishy, shady, suspicious. from ''louche''.

; Ienche : n., Dog. from &quot;chien&quot;. &quot;Les ienches, ca me fait flipper.&quot; (Pronounced &quot;ee-ansh&quot;)

; Keuf : Policeman (not polite) from flic &quot;Il est chelou ce mec ! j'vais le balancer aux keufs.&quot;

; Keum   : n., man, guy, dude, from ''mec''.

; Meuf : n., Woman, chick, girl. from ''femme''.

; Ouf : adj., Crazy, ridiculous. from ''fou''. Used commonly in the expression &quot;c'est un truc de ouf&quot; (&quot;that is madness&quot;).

; Portnawak : see 'n'importe quoi'

; Relou : adj., Not funny, difficult, something that sucks. from ''lourd'', heavy. (the ''d'' is dropped in Verlan because the final ''d'' does not pronounce in ''lourd'').

; Ripou : adj., Rotten, awful, gross. from ''pourri''
: Ripou = un policier qui commet des actes graves illégaux
: pl : des ripou'''x'''

; Teuf : n., Party. from ''fête''.

; Venère : adj., aggravated, angry, pissed off. from ''enervé(e)''.

==Common chat abbreviations==

* '''é''' can be substituted for all homophonic equivalents including &quot;-ais&quot;, &quot;-ait&quot;, &quot;-es&quot; (such as in the articles ''les'' and ''des''), the conjunction &quot;et&quot; (and), and the verb &quot;est&quot; (third person sing. conjugation of ''être'', &quot;to be&quot;).
* words that end in a silent '''-s''' commonly drop this ''s'': such as ''pas'' (''pa''), and ''vois'' (''voi'').

== Grammatik 2-5 ~ Word Formation ==
As in any language, many words in German are constructed from other smaller words that provide similar meaning, although the connections can sometimes be obscured by the passage of time. Construction of new words from word combinations is especially prevalent with German nouns, and understanding word roots can therefore be helpful in learning new words. As an example, consider the phrase ''Auf Wiedersehen'' &amp;mdash; the standard translation into English being 'Good bye', although it means literally 'upon reunion' (in essence, &quot;until we meet again&quot;). The noun, ''das Wiedersehen'', consists of ''wieder'', 'once again' (or 're-' as a prefix), and ''sehen'' or 'see'.

The noun ''die Geschäftsleute'' provides a direct example of a compounded noun: the first part of each deriving from ''das Geschäft'' ('business') and the second part from ''die Leute'' ('people'). The gender of a compound noun follows the base or last noun.

There are other examples in the this lesson, but these may not be immediately obvious unless you already have a good command of German words. However, you should train yourself to view new words in terms of the meanings of their component parts.  Consider all of the various words used in this lesson to describe types of cheeses: ''der Hartkäse'', ''der Schmelzkäse'', ''der Schweizerkäse''; or nouns and verbs related to buying and selling (''Kaufen und Verkaufen'').                          
----

== Grammatik 2-6 ~ Personal Pronouns: nominative case ==
Here are the personal pronouns in the '''nominative''' case: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Singular&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Plural&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1st person || &amp;nbsp;'''ich'''&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''wir'''
| &amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
| 2nd person&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''du''' ('''Sie'''*)
| &amp;nbsp;you
| &amp;nbsp;'''ihr''' ('''Sie'''*) || &amp;nbsp;you
|-
| 3rd person
| &amp;nbsp;'''er, sie, es'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;he, she, it&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''sie''' &lt;small&gt;(all genders)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;they
|}
:*&lt;small&gt;'''Polite''' form.&lt;/small&gt;

The nominative case is that of the subject of a verb. The pronoun '''subject''' of these sentences is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; in the German and the English:
{|
|''&lt;u&gt;Es&lt;/u&gt; geht mir gut.''
|&lt;u&gt;It&lt;/u&gt; goes well (for) me.
|- 
|''Das kann &lt;u&gt;ich&lt;/u&gt; verstehen.''
|That &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; can understand.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Du&lt;/u&gt; bist ein Schwein!''
|&lt;u&gt;You&lt;/u&gt; are a pig!
|-
|''Und können &lt;u&gt;Sie&lt;/u&gt; mir sagen...?''
|And can &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; tell (to) me...?
|} 
This last sentence is an example from Gespräch 2-3 using the '''polite form''' of 'you'. Whether singular or plural must be established by context. This next sentence translates with ''sie'' as 'they':
{|
|''Und können &lt;u&gt;sie&lt;/u&gt; mir sagen...?''
|And can &lt;u&gt;they&lt;/u&gt; tell me...?
|-
|And this one, with ''sie'' as 'she':
|-
|''Und kann &lt;u&gt;sie&lt;/u&gt; mir sagen...?''
|And can &lt;u&gt;she&lt;/u&gt; tell me...?
|}
as evidenced by the form taken by the verb 'can' (''können''). Other uses of the nominative case in German will be explored in future lessons. Tables of the pronouns in all cases are summarized in the grammar appendix: [[German/Appendix 3#Personal Pronoun Tables|Pronoun Tables]].

&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: An intransitive verb cannot be followed by an object in English or German.  A pronoun following an intransitive verb such as 'to be' is called a predicate pronoun and should be in the nominative case. In English 'It is I' is correct; 'It is me' is incorrect. 
----
== Grammatik 2-7 ~ More on verb forms ==
Just as English sometimes adds the verb &quot;to be&quot;, forming the progressive, note also in [[German/Lesson_2|Grammatik 2-2]] (in both question sentence examples) that English also may insert the verb 'to do' (called the emphatic form), especially useful when  forming a question. This is not done in German:
{|
|''&lt;u&gt;Haben&lt;/u&gt; Sie zu viel Arbeit?''
|becomes in English:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.
|&lt;u&gt;Do&lt;/u&gt; you &lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt; too much work?
|(Notice polite form of 'you' here)
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Hast&lt;/u&gt; du jede Wurst?''
|becomes in English:
|&lt;u&gt;Do&lt;/u&gt; you &lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt; every sausage? 
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Hat&lt;/u&gt; Helena zehn Finger?''
|becomes in English:
|&lt;u&gt;Does&lt;/u&gt; Helena &lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt; ten fingers?
|}
Again, in the present tense, the English sentences:
:'I write a letter.'
:'I do write a letter.'
are all, in German: ''Ich schreibe einen Brief.''
:'I am writing a letter.'
means: ''Ich schreibe gerade einen Brief.''

== Vokabeln 2-4 ==
 der Brief                  letter
 das Einkaufen              shopping
 der Finger, die Finger     finger, fingers
 das Kaufen                 buying                (use of the verb form is preferred)
 das Schwein                pig                   (compare with ''die Schweinswurst'')
 das Verkaufen              selling

 können                     can
 schreiben                  write

 jede                       any
 zehn                       ten

== Andere Wörter 2A ==
Using these additional vocabulary words, you should be able to restate '''Gespräch 2-2''' above, altering the meaning (or time of day) of the conversation.

 der Abend                evening

 Guten Abend!             Good Evening (greeting)
 morgen früh              tomorrow morning
 zu wenig                 too little

 abend                    evening
 abends                   evenings
 falsch                   false, wrong
 morgen                   tomorrow
 morgens                  in the morning
 schlecht                 bad
:*&lt;small&gt;[[German/Appendices/Alphabet|Pronunciation Guide]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
----
== Übersetzung 2-2 ==
Write these sentences in German. Pay attention to the additional words presented in ''Andere Wörter 2A'':
#Good evening Catherine.Where are you going?
#I'm looking for a good Swiss cheese.
#That is wrong! Too little is too little.

Currently, whilst avoiding real work have been adding to the GCSE science textbook,(I remember taking my GCSE's and so am filled with sympathy for those who are i the midst of the dual-science award syllabus). 

I also am interested in working on pages discussing Acoustics and Vibration as that is the area of both my degrees and current research.

== Why orthodox order? ==
What's so great about the orthodox order?
:Probably because it makes the textbook potentially most useful. Orthodox, by definition is the order that most instructors follow when they teach the subject&amp;mdash;the textbook is likely to be useful to the most number of people possible, if it follows the orthodox order. There is something to be said for unorthodox-order textbooks (I, for one, am fond of Feynman's lecture series), but there has to be at least one textbook that goes in the orthodox order, so that the instructors who are considering the textbook are not forced to jump around the book. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 23:27, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

== Reorganization ==
I just re-organized the book. Currently, it's organized roughly as:
* Divide it into three parts to follow three-semester introductory physics courses taught in U.S. schools
* The first part should cover: preliminary materials, Newtonian mechanics and waves (but not E&amp;M).
* The second part should cover: thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism (up to electromagnetic waves, but not its implications on relativity)
* the third part should cover: more on electromagnetic waves (perhaps as an intro to relativity), relativity (*some* materials on general relativity for advanced students), optics, and quantum mechanics.
For this particular outline, I am mainly motivated by the [http://sis.berkeley.edu/catalog/gcc_list_crse_req?p_dept_name=Physics&amp;p_dept_cd=PHYSICS Physics 7A-C] in my undergraduate institution, UC Berkeley. The bit about general relativity was because I was so frustrated myself 5 years ago, when the texts would hint at the importance of general relativity, without ever telling us why.

Obviously, this is not the only way to divide out the material into clear three-semester chunks and I would appreciate any improvements on it, but in lack of a response from a past contributor (but most seem to have abandoned this book for a while), I will go ahead and start making changes.

== Inconsistent notation? ==
I've looked over a few pages, and there are some serious inconsistencies with notations. I don't mind if this textbook's notations are not consistent with another textbook (like one that's more oriented towards abstract math), but it should at least be internally consistent. I'd suggest creating a &quot;notations&quot; page (it would also be convenient for students, like for looking up commonly used symbols) so that different editors could agree to a convention at one place and follow that convention elsewhere. Some inconsistency I've seen are: For vectors, &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;\vec{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}&lt;/math&gt; (I myself am in favor of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;, but I think most textbooks do use &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; more to denote vectors ... even though students will invariably have to use &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;). ... And that's it. Maybe &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;, but I think students need to see both (I myself is in favor of the latter).

== faster-than-light shadows? ==

On the [[Physics_with_Calculus/Modern/Special_Relativity|Special Relativity]] page:
&quot;For example, if I had a projector very far away from a screen, and I wave my hand in front of it very quickly, the shadow will travel faster than light.&quot;

Is this true?  At the instant I block the projector, there are still photons between my hand and the screen, and they'll travel at the speed of light toward the screen; there will be a slight delay before the shadow appears.  Am I misreading this?  Maybe it should be reworded.

[[User:DavePercy|DavePercy]] ([[User talk:DavePercy|talk]]) 01:45, 30 June 2008 (UTC)


You are right that it is poorly worded, but it is correct.  Look at the wall, and let a bug walk across the projector.  If the projector is very far from the wall, you will see the shadow of the bug moving faster than the speed of light.  You just cannot transmit information faster than light with the shadow.

== Too many menus ==

There seem to bee far too many divisions between chapters.  This is all very well and good for sections like Newton's laws, but when you scroll further, you get one chapter per subhead.  If nobody has an objection within a few months or so, I'll start rearranging these sections and consolidate a number of them.  --[[User:Freiberg|Freiberg]] ([[User talk:Freiberg|talk]]) 12:29, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

== Multiple efforts to create a book like this ==

There are too many parallel efforts on this book.  I jumped into a parallel effort on Wikiversity before I found this book.  I think others on Wikiversity have made similar efforts, and I am not sure what should be done.  Also, a good way to achieve uniformity in notation and style is to copy equations from Wikipedia itself.  The articles on Wikipedia have improved greatly in the past few years.  --[[User:Guy vandegrift|Guy vandegrift]] ([[User talk:Guy vandegrift|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Guy vandegrift|contribs]]) 05:01, 20 November 2013 (UTC)

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language. It was named after the concept of adding objects to the [[C Programming|C]] language.

If you have programmed before and would like to see a little bit of how Objective-C works and is different from other programming languages, you can get an [[Objective-C Programming/overview|overview]].

Objective C was introduced with NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP, and was considerably extended in application due to its use with the [[Cocoa Programming|Cocoa]] libraries under Mac OS X or the GNUstep libraries. However, you can program in Objective-C without these libraries if you wish.

Because not everyone uses OPENSTEP or Mac OS X, we will introduce these library-specific details later.

Familiarity with the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]] is required, as Objective-C shares a lot with it, hence its name.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pipian. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pipian~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:1em; padding:5px; border:3px #666 double;&quot;&gt;$2&lt;/div&gt;
This block has been set to expire: '''$6'''.

&lt;big&gt; What is a block? &lt;/big&gt;

A [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|block]] is a measure used to protect Wikibooks from possible improper use or modification in breach of [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|editorial policies]]. Blocks can apply to a user account, an [[w:IP address|IP address]], or a range of IP addresses that is deemed responsible for or related to problematic activity. You may be an innocent victim of [[w:collateral damage|collateral damage]], whereby a block of some other activity has accidentally caused your account to be inaccessible.  The reason for your block may be found above.

&lt;big&gt; Most common causes &lt;/big&gt;

* Your [[w:IP address|IP address]] matches that used by another blocked account. Ask for further information and/or request unblocking.
* Your account or a connected IP has been used in a problematic way, or your username was unsuitable and you need to choose another. The reason should be in the box above.
|}

{| style=&quot;margin:6px auto; width:100%; background:transparent; border:2px solid #AAA; padding:5px;&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot; | &lt;h2 style=&quot;border:none;&quot;&gt;What do I do now?&lt;/h2&gt;
|-
|
* If instructions are given above in the block message, follow them.
* If you have never edited Wikibooks before and/or do not have an account, [[Special:UserLogin/signup|consider creating one]].
* If you wish to appeal the block, or you believe you have been blocked by mistake, please see the following section.

&lt;big&gt; Appealing &lt;/big&gt;

The current block will automatically expire $6. You have many routes to appeal the block or its duration. Firstly, if you are a registered user and have a valid e-mail address confirmed, you can contact $1 '''[[{{ns:special}}:Emailuser/$4|via e-mail]]'''. This feature can be removed if abused.

Alternatively, you may appeal the block by requesting that another [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] review the block. To do so, add
:&lt;tt&gt;{&amp;#123;unblock|''your reason here''&amp;#125;}&lt;/tt&gt;
to the '''bottom''' of [[{{ns:Special}}:Mytalk|your user discussion page]] to request unblocking. You '''must''' state a reason for this, and the block can then be discussed.

If $7 is not blocked, your [[w:IP address|IP address]] ($3) or range may have been blocked. Please check  &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:BlockList|ip=$3}} here]&lt;/span&gt;. If this is the case, please copy and paste the following text to the '''bottom''' of [[{{ns:Special}}:Mytalk|your user talk page]].

:&lt;tt&gt;{&amp;#123;unblock-ip|1=$3|2=&amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;$2&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;/nowiki&amp;gt;|3=$1&amp;#125;}&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC0000;&quot;&gt;'''Please note:'''&lt;/span&gt; While this block may be upsetting or unexpected, abuse of appeal processes, repeatedly using the unblock template when denied, [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|personal attacks]], or [[Wikibooks:Be civil|impolite conduct]] may lead to the removal of your ability to edit your discussion page.

|-
|
&lt;big&gt; Online Chat &lt;/big&gt;

You may also use the [[w:freenode|freenode]] [[Wikibooks:Contact_us#IRC|IRC]] network to discuss your block with administrators available at the time. If you have an IRC client, the channel can be found at &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[irc://irc.freenode.net/wikibooks #wikibooks].

&lt;big&gt; E-mailing us &lt;/big&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;padding:5px; margin-bottom:10px; border:1px solid #AAA; background-color:#DFF7FF; text-align:center; font-size:115%;&quot;&gt;
Due to the high volume of e-mail we receive, you are more likely to get a quick response if you try requesting an unblock via [[Special:MyTalk|your discussion page]] first.
&lt;/div&gt;

Before you e-mail us, please make sure that your situation has not already been addressed by the above sections. [[Special:MyTalk|Your discussion page]] may also contain further details related to your block or [[w:IP address|IP address]], and we strongly advise that you review it before contacting us.

Even though e-mails sent to the address are viewable only by [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] and trusted volunteers, '''under no circumstances''' should you e-mail us your account's password or reveal it to anyone else even if asked to. When requesting an account, a temporary password will be generated and e-mailed to you. Please change the password on your new account as soon as possible. You may contact us at wikibooks{{@}}wikimedia.org.

'''IMPORTANT:''' Please do not e-mail us without providing the information requested above. We will always require that information to help you. Any request to make edits to books on your behalf will be disregarded. Correspondence containing legal threats, [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|personal attacks]], or [[Wikibooks:Be civil|rudeness]] is likely to be ignored and may result in the extension of pre-existing blocks.

You can use this form to block editing access and account creation from individual accounts or IPs in accordance with the [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|blocking policy]].

'''Please remember to include an informative reason for blocking.''' When using the pull-down menu, please also elaborate on the following line whenever helpful (citing relevant policy pages, [[Wikibooks:Sockpuppets|sock puppet]] accounts, the nature of the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism|disruption]], etc.). Use civil, appropriate, and professional diction. Keep in mind that the block message will be very visible when volunteers try to edit Wikibooks.

'''Blocks of governmental IP ranges:''' If you block ''any'' IP in the ranges listed on the right under &quot;Sensitive IP addresses&quot;, you ''must'' notify the [[meta:Communications committee|Wikimedia Foundation Communications Committee]] immediately (see contact instructions there or use [[meta:Communications committee/Notifications|the notifications page]]). These ranges are allocated to major governmental organizations; blocks of these organizations have political and public relations implications of which the Foundation's press relations team must be aware. Avoid long blocks of these addresses, and ''be especially careful in formulating your block messages'' because your block message will probably be seen and commented on by the press.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can export the text and editing history of a particular page or
set of pages wrapped in some XML. This may then be imported into another
wiki running MediaWiki software through use of [[{{ns:Special}}:Import]].

To export Wikibook module pages, enter the titles in the text box below, one title per line, and
select whether you want the current version as well as all old versions, with the page
history lines, or just the current version with the info about the last edit.

In the latter case you can also use a link, e.g. [[{{ns:Special}}:Export/Chess]] for the
main Wikibook module [[Chess]].</text>

Also, there has been no previous definition of force, which makes this supposed proof spurious. At best, it's a poor way of motivating a ''definition'' of force, not a ''derivation''. Someone with a GCSE syllabus needs to correct this.</text>

==The Normal Force==

Why is it that we stay steady in our chairs when we sit down? According to the first law of motion, if an object is translationally in equilibrium (velocity is constant), the sum of all the forces acting on the object must be equal to zero.  For a person sitting on a chair, it can thus be postulated that a '''normal force''' is present balancing the '''gravitational force''' that pulls the sitting person down.  However, it should be noted that only some of the normal force can cancel the other forces to zero like in the case of a sitting person. In Physics, the term '''normal''' as a modifier of the '''force''' implies that this force is acting perpendicular to the surface at the point of contact of the two objects in question.  Imagine a person leaning on a vertical wall.  Since the person does not stumble or fall, he/she must be in equilibrium. Thus, the component of his/her weight along the horizontal is balanced or countered (opposite direction) by an equal amount of force -- this force is the ''normal force'' on the wall. So, on a slope, the normal force would not point upwards as on a horizontal surface but rather perpendicular to the slope surface.

The normal force can be provided by any one of the four fundamental forces, but is typically provided by electromagnetism since microscopically, it is the repulsion of electrons that enables interaction between surfaces of matter.  There is no easy way to calculate the normal force, other than by assuming first that there is a normal force acting on a body in contact with a surface (direction perpendicular to the surface).  If the object is not accelerating (for the case of uniform circular motion, the object is accelerating) then somehow, the magnitude of the normal force can be solved.  In most cases, the magnitude of the normal force can be solved together with other unknowns in a given problem.

Sometimes, the problem does not warrant the knowledge of the normal force(s).  It is in this regard that other formalisms (e.g. Lagrange method of undertermined coefficients) can be used to eventually ''solve'' the physical problem.

==Friction==

When there is relative motion between two surfaces, there is a resistance to the motion.  This force is called friction.  Friction is the reason why people could not accept Newton's first law of Motion, that an object tends to keep its state of motion. Friction acts opposite to the direction of the original force. '''The frictional force''' is equal to the '''frictional coefficient''' times the '''normal force'''.

Friction is caused due to attractive forces between the molecules near the surfaces of the objects. If two steel plates are made really flat and polished and cleaned and made to touch in a vacuum, it bonds together. It would look as if the steel was just one piece. The bonds are formed as in a normal steel piece. This is called cold welding. And this is the main cause of friction.

The above equation is an empirical one--in general, the frictional coefficient is not constant.  However, for a large variety of contact surfaces, there is a well characterized value.  This kind of friction is called Coulomb friction.  There is a separate coefficient for both static and kinetic friction.  This is because once an object is pushed on, it will suddenly jerk once you apply enough force and it begins to move.

Also, the frictional coefficient varies greatly depending on what two substances are in contact, and the temperature and smoothness of the two substances.  For example, the frictional coefficients of glass on glass are very high.  When you have similar materials, in most cases you don't have Coulomb friction.

For '''static friction''', the force of friction actually increases proportionally to the force applied, keeping the body immobile.  Once, however, the force exceeds the maximum frictional force, the body will begin to move.  The maximum frictional force is calculated as follows:

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{F}_f\right| \leq \mu_s\left|\vec{N}\right|&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''The static frictional force''' is less than or equal to the '''coefficient of static friction''' times the '''normal force'''.  Once the frictional force equals the coefficient of static friction times the normal force, the object will break away and begin to move.

Once it is moving, the frictional force then obeys:

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\left|\vec{F}_f\right| = \mu_k\left|\vec{N}\right|&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''The kinetic frictional force''' is equal to the '''coefficient of kinetic friction''' times the '''normal force'''.  As stated before, this always opposes the direction of motion.

&lt;br&gt;
'''Force of friction (F&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;): ''' The force placed on a moving object opposite its direction of motion due to the inherent roughness of all surfaces. Units: newtons (N)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Coefficient of friction ('''&amp;mu;'''):''' The coefficient that determines the amount of friction.  This varies tremendously based on the surfaces in contact.  There are no units for the coefficient of either static or kinetic friction&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

It's important to note, that in real life we often have to deal with viscose and turbulent friction - they appear when you move the body through the matter. 

Viscose friction is proportional to velocity and takes place at approximately low speeds. Turbulent friction is proportional to &lt;math&gt;V^2&lt;/math&gt; and takes place at higher velocities.

'''Before we begin'''
:This chapter will not attempt to teach you how to program rigorously. Therefore a basic working knowledge of the C programming language is highly recommended. It is recommended that you learn as much about the C programming language as possible before learning the materials in this chapter.

:Please read the first 7 lessons of [http://cplus.about.com/od/learningc/a/ctutorialprelim.htm: &quot;C Programming Tutorial&quot;] at About.com if you are unfamiliar with programming or the C programming language.

As you gain programming experience you will appreciate the more specific explanations like [[C_language | The C Programming Wikibook]].

== Introduction to programming ==
Programming has many uses. Some areas where programming and computer science in general are extremely important include artificial intelligence and statistics. Programming allows you to use computers flexibly and process data very quickly.

When a program is written, it is written into a textual form that a human can understand. However, a computer doesn't directly understand what a human writes. It needs to be transformed into a way that the computer can directly understand.

For example, a computer is like a person who reads and speaks German. You write and speak in English. The letter you write to the computer needs to be translated for the computer to speak. The program responsible for this work is referred to as the ''compiler''. 

You need to ''compile'' your English-like instructions, so that the computer can understand it. Once a program has been compiled, it is hard to &quot;un-compile&quot; it, or transform it back into English again. A programmer writes the program (to use our analogy, in English), called ''source code'', which is a human-readable definition of the program, and then the ''compiler'' translates this into &quot;machine code&quot;. We recommend using the widely available gcc compiler.

When we look at mathematical programming here, we will look at how we can write programs that will solve some difficult mathematical problems that would take us normally a lot of time to solve. For example, if we wanted to find an approximation to the root of the polynomial ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+1 - this is very difficult for a human to solve. However a computer can do this no sweat -- how?

=== Programming language basics ===
We will be using the C programming language throughout the chapter, please learn about the basics of C by reading the first 7 lessons of [http://cplus.about.com/od/learningc/a/ctutorialprelim.htm: &quot;C Programming Tutorial&quot;] at About.com.

===Sample C Program===


* [[/Sample C Program/]]

== Data Types ==

'''Size Constraints: Header files limits.h, and float.h  '''

Computers are machines based on Boolean logic.  This means that the computer is based on some method of differentiating a state as true or false, or set and not set.  Abstractly we think of computers as using 1's for true or set and 0's for false or not set.  We refer to these 1's and 0's as bits.  In computers we don't keep track of information as bits.  Instead information in a computer is stored in addressable blocks called bytes.  A byte is the smallest piece of memory that can be accessed in the computer that is not a bit.  When we declare a [scalar] variable in a C program that memory has an address and a length.  The address says where the memory starts, and the length states how many bytes are used to express the variable.

The include file [[w:Limits.h|&lt;limits.h&gt;]] is used to define the size of addressable integer types and the include file [[w:Float.h|&lt;float.h&gt;]] is used to define the size of addressable floating point types.  The values in these files are compiler and computer dependent.  This means that if you change compilers or compile your program on a different type of computer it may execute differently.

Here are some of the values defined in these two files:



''' Exercises '''

== Programming With Integers ==
Discrete programming deals with integers and how they are manipulated using the computer.

=== Integer Operations ===

=== Understanding integer division ===
In C, the command
:int number;
:number = 3 / 2;
will set aside some space in the computer memory, and we can refer to that space by the ''variable'' name '''number'''. In the computer's mind, number is an integer, nothing else. After
:number = 3 / 2;
numbers equals 1, not 1.5, this is due to that fact that '''/''' when applied to two integers will give only the integer part of the result. For example in C:
:5 / 2 equals 2
:353 / 3 equals 117
:-5 / 2 equals -2
:353 / -3 equals -117
: -5 / - 2 equals 2

If the number you are testing is between one and negative one - for example 2 / 5 or -2 / 5 then the result is undefined, although most compilers return 0. 

The ''modular operator'', %, returns the remainder resulting from integer division. For example in C:

:5 % 2 equals 2
:353 % 3 equals 2
:-5 % 2 equals -2
:353 % - 3 equals 2
:-5 % -2 equals -1

The sign of the result takes on the sign of the dividend as you would expect.  For fractions that are between one and negative one the result is the same as the numerator.  

''' Exercises '''

Exercise 1

Write down your thoughts on what a program to explore division and modulus should do.&lt;br&gt;
:*What processing has to occur?
:*What types of input do you have?
:*What does your output look like?

The following example will walk you through this exercise.

===C Program Example For Exercise 1 ===

* [[/Program to Explore Integer Division And Integer Modulus/]]

=== Modeling Recursively defined functions ===
The factorial function n! is recursively defined:
:0! = 1
:n! = n&amp;times;(n-1)! if n &amp;ge; 1
In C, if fact(n) is the functions as described above we want
:&lt;math&gt;fact(0) = 1;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;fact(n) = n * fact(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;
we should note that all recursively defined functions have a ''terminating condition'', it is the case where the function can give a direct answer to, e.g. fact(0) = 1.

We can model the factorial functions easily with the following code and then execute it:
:int fact (int n)
:{
::  if (n == 0)
:::    return 1;
::  if (n &gt;= 1)
:::    return n * fact(n - 1);
:}
The C function above models the factorial function very naturally. To test the results, we can compile the following code:
:&amp;#x0023;include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* Standard Input &amp; Output Header file */
:int fact (int n)
:{
::  if (n == 0)
:::    return 1;
::  if (n &gt;= 1)
:::    return n * fact(n - 1);
:}
:int main(void)
:{
::int n = 5;
::printf(&quot;%d&quot;, fact(n)); /* printf is defined in stdio.h */
:}

We can also model the Fibonacci number function. Let fib(n) return the (''n'' + 1)th Fibonacci number, the following should be clear
:fib(0) should return 1
:fib(1) should return 1
:fib(n) should return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); for n &amp;ge; 2
we can model the above using C:
:int fib (int n)
:{
::if (n == 0 || n == 1) /* if n = 0 or if n = 1 */
:::return 1;
::if (n &gt;= 2)
:::return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
:}
Again, you shall see that modeling a recursive function is not hard, as it only involves translating the mathematics in C code.

=== Modeling non-recursive functions ===
There are functions that involve only integers, and they can be modelled quite nicely using ''functions'' in C. The factorial function
:f(n) = n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... 3&amp;times;2&amp;times;1
can be modeled quite simply using the following code

 int n = 10;  //get factorial for 10
 int f = 1;   //start f at 1
 while(n &gt; 0) //keep looping if n bigger then 0
 {
    f = n * f; //f is now product of f and n
    n = n - 1; //n is one less (repeat loop)
 }

== Floating point Programming ==

Programs can not only be written with integer values, but also with various forms of floating-point values. You should normally use the ''double'' keyword to define a floating point number; the reason for this is that in many cases, the intuitive way to write an expression in floating point arithmetic is suboptimal. Floating point arithmetic is non-associative - in base-10, a system that has 2 places of accuracy has (1.0 + 0.02) + 0.04 = 1.0 (rounded down because 1.02 rounds to 1.0, and then 1.04 rounds down to 1.0), but 1.0 + (0.02 + 0.04) = 1.0 + 0.06 = 1.1. There also exists a ''float'' type, which uses 4 bytes instead of 8, but you should not use it unless you know what you are doing, since there is only 24 bits of accuracy, or roughly 9 base-10 significant digits.

Beware: If you use 2 integer operands, it still performs integer arithmetic, so this prints 1, not 1.5 as you'd expect:

:double number;
:number = 3/2;
:printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;,number);

An example of a definition of a floating-point number and then calculating 3/2:

:double number = 3;
:number /= 2;
:printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;,number);

A caveat: floating point numbers do not perfectly represent all decimal numbers. Obviously, because the memory consumed by a variable is finite, it cannot represent an infinite number, but only an approximation of it. In addition, some numbers cannot be perfectly represented in floating point. In this code:

:double number;
:number = 1/10;

the value of number is not 0.1, but actually 0.10000000000000001.

An analogy of this limitation is the value of 1/3. In the decimal system, this value cannot be exactly represented with a finite number of 3s, as in 0.333...  Since 2 and 5 are the only prime factors of 10 (the base of the decimal system), only fractions with denominators comprising products of 2s and 5s, such as 5/8 &lt;math&gt;\left ( \tfrac{5}{2^3} \right )&lt;/math&gt; or 231/250 &lt;math&gt;\left ( \tfrac{231}{2\times5^3} \right )&lt;/math&gt; (but not 1/3 or 5/14) can be exactly represented by decimal numbers (0.625 and 0.924, respectively).

Computers use base 2 arithmetic, so only fractions with denominators comprising products of 2s (powers of 2), such as 5/8 &lt;math&gt;\left ( \tfrac{5}{2^3} \right )&lt;/math&gt; or 231/256 &lt;math&gt;\left ( \tfrac{231}{2^8} \right )&lt;/math&gt; (but not 231/250, 1/3 or 1/10, as above) can be exactly represented by a floating point number.

=Fields=

A field is one of the more difficult concepts to grasp in physics.  A field is an area or region in which an influence or force is effective regardless of the presence or absence of a material medium. Simply put, a '''field''' is a collection of vectors often representing the force an object ''would'' feel if it were placed at any particular point in space.  With gravity, the field is measured in newtons, as it depends solely on the mass of an object, but with electricity, it is measured in newtons per coulomb, as the force on an electrical charge depends on the amount of that charge.  Typically these fields are calculated based on canceling out the effect of a body in the point in space that the field is desired.  As a result, a field is a vector, and as such, it can (and should) be added when calculating the field created by TWO objects at one point in space.

Fields are typically illustrated through the use of what are called '''field lines''' or '''lines of force'''.  Given a source that exerts a force on points around it, sample lines are drawn representing the direction of the field at points in space around the force-exerting source.

There are three major categories of fields:

# '''Uniform fields''' are fields that have the same value at any point in space.  As a result, the lines of force are parallel.
# '''Spherical fields''' are fields that have an origin at a particular point in space and vary at varying distances from that point.
# '''Complex fields''' are fields that are difficult to work with mathematically (except under simple cases, such as fields created by two point object), but field lines can still typically be drawn.  '''Dipoles''' are a specific kind of complex field.

Magnetism also has a field, measured in Tesla, and it also has '''field lines''', but its use is more complicated than simple &quot;force&quot; fields.  Secondly, it also only appears in a two-pole form, and as such, is difficult to calculate easily.

The particles that form these magnetic fields and lines of force are called electrons and not magnetons. A magneton is a quantity in magnetism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm glad you liked HSE so much! I'm trying my best to do a good job, but as so often is the case in my first drafts, glaring spelling and grammar mistakes seem to plague my work. Lucky you pick them out for me.

I do not know enough about Lisp, Prolog, Scheme (never heard of it) or Haskell to decide whether they are suitable for high school students or not. If you think a coherent course can be taught using one of those languages, then please go ahead! Create a new chapte if you have to. But I was thinking of teaching a more conventional language like Pascal. Anyway we are not just writing about programming, but mathematical programming. Haskell seems to be a good choice, but where can I find a good programming IDE/compiler for it? I simply haven't done the research.

And nice to meet you. How do you do?

[[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo Jia Dai]]

:[http://www.schemers.org Scheme] is a simpler version of Lisp designed for teaching theoretical computer science. It's also used in some professional applications such as GIMP, the image editor. I would highly recommend it as it is fairly similar to Lisp. Note that the version taught at [http://www.htdp.org How To Design Programs] isn't quite the standard.

== Lucid Dreaming deletion ==
Hi r3m0t, I don't know of a way to delete the version from the history except delete the whole page and the whole history. I think the page should be OK in the old versions list because it is not actively used and people will tend not to refer to it. Thanks for your concern and if there is a way to delete just that version I'd be happy to do it for you. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==gcse science==

Hi thanks for your offer of help. I suppose we could go at movement and change, most of the stuff comes under forces, but I've kinda got bored with physics after doing electricity and was thinking of starting a chemistry module. Would you be willing to help out with that ? What are you studying in chemistry at the moment ? (says Theresa Knott 26 March)

==Lucid Dreaming FAQ==

On the subect of copyrights, I can only point out the bold text on the bottom of the submit page...

I took out the nowiki tags because they show up when the message is inculded in other pages. look at [[Los verbos reflexivos (Spanish)]]. I think this is a bug. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 13:59, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Hey Remot,==

I saw a little mention of the LD wikibook in alt.dreams.lucid. Good job so far! Thanks for the tips, I'll continue writing stuff whenever I feel I have some info to share.

== Remot ==

A long time ago, you asked if I'd like to move the material in the &quot;Science in Simple Steps&quot; development hypertextbook to Wikibooks.  Having finally gotten enough time to pay at least a bit of attention to the projec again, ''I would love to.''  Especially since I don't know when work and other factors may swallow me whole again, and I'd want the start we've made to go somewhere where others can carry on the good work without having months go by with their messages unanswered. :P   So I would like to ask - beg, even - that you and the others with you help guide me through the process of setting things up and getting them copied over in a way that is consistent with the WikiBooks organization.  I would be endlessly grateful for the help.  [[User:April Follies]]

: Erm, I just about started that page when we stopped studying it in class. However, lucky for you (assuming you want to see the page grow but are too lazy to do it yourself) it's an exam text, not a coursework, so I'll have to revise it.

: I put dinosaurs on that page previously. What happened? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 09:15, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::They were removed as a non starter because of difficulties getting suitable media. The trouble with dinosuars is that it's only possible to easily get photos of bones. Bones are fine, we should certainly have them but we also need good quality artists impressions. It'll be much easier to get artists once the project is up and running. I had to narrow the choice down to a managable list. i opted for the three where we had plenty of photographs already, so that we wouldn't be held back by lack of media.

== message from [[User:166.121.36.7]] found in wikibook main text ==

The following message was posted by [[User:166.121.36.7]] in the Lucid Dreaming wikibook. Like an idiot, I replied in the main text too instead of sending you this message. I also replied to the user on the talkpage, but feel free to send him additional comments if you have any.

--&gt; to whoever messaged me... hmm, i have no idea how to message you back, but since you deleted my test, i guess i can talk to you from here. just wondering, isn't the concept of a freely editable &quot;wikibook&quot; something dangerous? if anybody was feeling malicious, he could just go and delete all the contents...

: (note: I'm not the one who deleted your test) When an edit is made to a page, even an entire content deletion, the version of the page before that is saved so someone can revert (i.e. reverse) it. By clicking on the &quot;history&quot; tab at the top of the page you can view all the edits that have been made to it, latest edit first. To send a message to a user you go to the page &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;User talk:[username]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; (no quotes, replace &lt;nowiki&gt;[username]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the username of the person you want to talk to) and edit that page.

== Book of the month ==

Hi R3m0t! Congratulations for the book of the month! Thank you for helping me to change all pages connected to &quot;Book of the month&quot;. I wanted to do it by myself, but fell asleep (00:00 UTC is 1:00 over here), and didn't get up until now. Anyway, would you help me also in the future to organize things? Your help is highly appreciated, and I think you do things in a very professional way. You also did a good job in talking to people who did not vote correctly. B.t.w. I put in a picture on the main page temporarily, but you can replace it with yours once you are allowed to. Cheers, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 08:01, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: I'm proud. :) I live in London, so I was up till about 00:30 closing the vote and updating pages related to it. Today I was really sleepy at school, but never mind. I'm happy to help with any more administrivia ;) you would like done. Thanks for putting that picture up.

Hey people i've been trying my BEST to get a lucid dream,i cant,help me!!!

== REMask device ==

Hi out there , has anyone used an REmask and are they as good , better , worse than the lifetools nova dreamer. Nova dreamers are so dear and hard to get that for $130 i'm considering one .
Any views.
45 never been lucid ( that I can recall ) , read about it and am dying to experience it too.
Any dietery triggers knownabout or worth a go. Tried sleep - wake - sleep with SUGAR but still nothing. 
Can you try too hard ?

== Addition to Lucid Dreaming ==

I placed my mattress on my bedroom's heating vent (you have no idea how comfortable that can be). Although I've never been lucid in a dream, I have noticed that the dreams themselves are more clear than they used to be (or maybe it improved my recall for some reason, who knows). Maybe you can start a chapter on external stimulation.

(I don't understand this editor too well, I hope this comes out ok)

== Translation in french language. ==

Hello,

I'm very interesting in Lucid dreaming. However, french lucid dreaming community isn't very large.

We need documentation about lucid dreaming but we're not enough in order to redact them.

That's why I ask you if I can translate them into french.

In waiting your approbation,
Nicolas.

== Appreciation ==

Hi, I'm reading the Lucid Dreaming book now. It is excellent. Thank you very much.

== About Lucid Dreaming ==

Hello!
I've found very useful your book about lucid dreaming... you should go on with this idea!
I want to ask you about a problem I have. I find too difficult in concentrating before sleeping, nad most methods needs concentration. Which method requires less concentration?
Please, send me an e-mail to gzimize at gmail.com

== I'm willing to help ==

Hey, I'm willing to help you with anything on your Lucid Dreaming book. I know quite a lot myself, and I am willing to do research, etc. I guess just post back on my talk page? -Erik212

==Good Resource==

Hey I took a look at your lucid dreaming book it's pretty good.  I have narcolepsy myself and I have been lucid dreaming almost every night for over 3 years.  It's something else I'll tell ya.  If you have any questions or anything I'm sure I could offer my insight.  I'm somewhat of a self proclaimed sleep expert.  You can post on my talk page or email me. -lethargiclown

==Two-Dimensional Vectors==
===Introduction===
In most mathematics courses up until this point, we deal with '''scalars'''.  These are quantities which only need one number to express.  For instance, the amount of gasoline used to drive to the grocery store is a scalar quantity because it only needs one number: 2 gallons.

In this unit, we deal with '''vectors'''.  A vector is a '''directed line segment''' -- that is, a line segment that points one direction or the other.  As such, it has an '''initial point''' and a '''terminal point'''.  The vector starts at the initial point and ends at the terminal point, and the vector points towards the terminal point.  A vector is drawn as a line segment with an arrow at the terminal point:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:VectorCalculations_1.png|60px|A single vector without coordinate axes.]]&lt;/center&gt;


The same vector can be placed anywhere on the coordinate plane and still be the same vector -- the only two bits of information a vector represents are the '''magnitude''' and the '''direction'''.  The magnitude is simply the length of the vector, and the direction is the angle at which it points.  Since neither of these specify a starting or ending ''location'', the same vector can be placed anywhere.  To illustrate, all of the line segments below can be defined as the vector with magnitude &lt;math&gt;4\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and angle 45 degrees:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:VectorCalculations_2.png|175px|Multiple locations for the same vector.]]&lt;/center&gt;

It is customary, however, to place the vector with the initial point at the origin as indicated by the black vector.  This is called the '''standard position'''.

===Component Form===

In standard practice, we don't express vectors by listing the length and the direction.  We instead use '''component form''', which lists the height (rise) and width (run) of the vectors.  It is written as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \mathrm{run} \\ \mathrm{rise}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:VectorCalculations_3.png|150px|Vector with rise and run measurements.]]
&lt;/center&gt;

Other ways of denoting a vector in component form include:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{(u_x,u_y)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\left\langle u_x,u_y\right\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

From the diagram we can now see the benefits of the standard position: the two numbers for the terminal point's coordinates are the same numbers for the vector's rise and run.  Note that we named this vector ''u''.  Just as you can assign numbers to variables in algebra (usually x, y, and z), you can assign vectors to variables in calculus.  The letters u, v, and w are usually used, and either boldface or an arrow over the letter is used to identify it as a vector.

When expressing a vector in component form, it is no longer obvious what the magnitude and direction are.  Therefore, we have to perform some calculations to find the magnitude and direction.

===Magnitude===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{u}| = \sqrt{u_x^2+u_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; is the width, or run, of the vector; &lt;math&gt;u_y&lt;/math&gt; is the height, or rise, of the vector.  You should recognize this formula as the Pythagorean theorem.  It is -- the magnitude is the distance between the initial point and the terminal point.

The magnitude of a vector can also be called the norm.

===Direction===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{u_y}{u_x}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:VectorCalculations_4.png|150px|Vector triangle with ux and uy labeled.]]
&lt;/center&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the counter-clockwise angle made by the vector with the positive x-axis.  This formula is simply the tangent formula for right triangles.

===Vector Operations===

For these definitions, assume:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_x \\ u_y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_x \\ v_y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


====Vector Addition====
Vector Addition is often called ''tip-to-tail'' addition, because this makes it easier to remember.

The sum of the vectors you are adding is called the resultant vector, and is the vector drawn from the initial point (tip) of the first vector to the terminal point (tail) of the second vector. Although they look like the arrows, the pointy bit is the tail, not the tip. (Imagine you were walking the direction the vector was pointing... you would start at the flat end (tip) and walk toward the pointy end.)

&lt;center&gt;

It looks like this:

[[Image:VectorCalculations_5.png|175px|Tip-to-tail addition]]

(Notice, the black lined vector is the sum of the two dotted line vectors!)


Numerically:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Or more generally:
&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} u_x + v_x \\ u_y + v_y \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Scalar Multiplication====
Graphically, multiplying a vector by a scalar changes only the magnitude of the vector by that same scalar.  That is, multiplying a vector by 2 will &quot;stretch&quot; the vector to twice its original magnitude, keeping the direction the same.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:VectorCalculations_6.png|175px|Multiplication of a vector with a scalar]]

&lt;math&gt;2 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Numerically, you calculate the resultant vector with this formula:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;c \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} c u_x \\ c u_y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, where c is a constant scalar.&lt;/center&gt;

As previously stated, the magnitude is changed by the same constant:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;|c \mathbf{u}| = |c| |\mathbf{u}|&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since multiplying a vector by a constant results in a vector in the same direction, we can reason that two vectors are parallel if one is a constant multiple of the other -- that is, that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} || \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = c \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant c.`

We can also divide by a non-zero scalar by instead multiplying by the reciprocal, as with dividing regular numbers:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{u}}{c} = \frac{1}{c} \mathbf{u}, {c}\ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


====Dot Product====
The dot product is a way of multiplying two vectors to produce a scalar value. Because it combines the components of two vectors to form a /scalar/, it is sometimes called a scalar product. If you were asked to take the 'dot product of two rectangular vectors' you would do the following:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_x v_x + u_y v_y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Calculus/Vectors&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9

It is very important to note that the dot product of two vectors does '''not''' result in another vector, it gives you a scalar, just a numerical value. 

Another common pitfall may arise if your vectors are not in rectangular ('cartesian') format. Sometimes, vectors are instead expressed in polar coordinates, where the first component is the vector's magnitude (length) and the second is the angle from the x-axis at which the vector should be oriented. Dot products cannot be performed using the conventional method on these sorts of vectors; vectors in polar format must be converted to their equivalent rectangular form before you can work with them using the formula given above. A common way to convert to rectangular coordinates is to imagine that the vector was projected horizontally and vertically to form a right triangle. You could then use properties of sin and cos to find the length of the two legs the right triangle. The horizontal length would then be the x-component of the rectangular expression of the vector and the vertical length would be the y-component. Remember that if the vector is pointing down or to the left, the corresponding components would have to be negative to indicate that.

With some rearrangement and trigonometric manipulation, we can see that the number that results from the dot product of two vectors is a surprising and useful identity:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = |\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}| \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the two vectors. 
This provides a convenient way of finding the angle between two vectors:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{
|\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that the dot product is 'commutative', that is:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Also, the dot product of two vectors will be the length of the vector squared:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = u_x u_x + u_y u_y = (u_x)^2+(u_y)^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and by the Pythagorean theorem,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(u_x)^2+(u_y)^2=||u||^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The dot product can be visualized as the length of a projection of one vector on to the other. In other words, the dot product asks 'how much magnitude of this vector is going in the direction of that vector?'

===Applications of Scalar Multiplication and Dot Product===

====Unit Vectors====

A '''unit vector''' is a vector with a magnitude of 1.  The '''unit vector of u''' is a vector in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;, but with a magnitude of 1:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:VectorCalculations_7.png|175px|Unit vector]]&lt;/center&gt;


The process of finding the unit vector of u is called '''normalization'''.  As  mentioned in '''scalar multiplication''', multiplying a vector by constant C will result in the magnitude being multiplied by C.  We know how to calculate the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  We know that dividing a vector by a constant will divide the magnitude by that constant.  Therefore, if that constant is the magnitude, dividing the vector by the magnitude will result in a unit vector in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}=\frac{\mathbf{u}}{|\mathbf{u}|}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

====Standard Unit Vectors====

A special case of ''Unit Vectors'' are the ''Standard Unit Vectors'' '''i'''
and '''j''':  '''i''' points one unit directly right in the x direction, and '''j''' points one unit directly up in the y direction:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Using the scalar multiplication and vector addition rules, we can then express vectors in a different way:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

If we work that equation out, it makes sense.  Multiplying x by '''i''' will result in the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.  Multiplying y by '''j''' will result in the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.  Adding these two together will give us our original vector, &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressing vectors using i and j is called '''standard form'''.

====Projection and Decomposition of Vectors====
Sometimes it is necessary to decompose a vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
into two components: one component parallel to a vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}
&lt;/math&gt;,  which we will call &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_ \parallel &lt;/math&gt;; and one component perpendicular to it, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_ \bot &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:VectorCalculations_8.png|175px|Projection of a vector]]&lt;/center&gt;

Since the length of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_ \parallel &lt;/math&gt; is
(&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{u}| \cdot \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt;), it is straightforward to
write down the formulas for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_ \bot &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{u}_ \parallel &lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u_ \parallel} = |\mathbf{u}| * \frac{(\mathbf{u} \cdot
\mathbf{v})}{(|\mathbf{u}| |\mathbf{v}|)} * \frac{\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{v}|}= 
(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v})/(|\mathbf{v}|^2)  \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_ \bot = \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{u}_ \parallel
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

====Length of a vector====
The length of a vector is given by the dot product of a vector with itself, and &lt;math&gt; \theta = 0 \ rad &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = |\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{u}| \cos \theta = |\mathbf{u}|^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

====Perpendicular vectors====
If the angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; between two vectors is 90 degrees or &lt;math&gt; {\pi \over 2} &lt;/math&gt; (if the two vectors are orthogonal to each other), that is the vectors are perpendicular, then the dot product is 0.
This provides us with an easy way to find a perpendicular vector: if you have a vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_x \\ u_y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, a perpendicular vector can easily be found by either
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -u_y \\ u_x \end{pmatrix} = - \begin{pmatrix} u_y \\ -u_x \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


===Polar coordinates===

Polar coordinates are an alternative two-dimensional coordinate system, which is often useful when rotations are important. Instead of specifying the position along the ''x'' and ''y'' axes, we specify the distance from the origin, ''r'', and the direction, an angle &amp;theta;.

[[Image:Coordonnees polaires plan.png|Polar coordinates]]

Looking at this diagram, we can see that the values of ''x'' and ''y'' are related to those of ''r'' and &amp;theta; by the equations
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
x=r \cos \theta &amp; r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\
y=r \sin \theta &amp; \theta = \arctan\frac{y}{x} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Because tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is multivalued, care must be taken to select the right value.

Just as for Cartesian coordinates the unit vectors that point in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions are special, so in polar coordinates the unit vectors that point in the ''r'' and &amp;theta; directions are also special.

We will call these vectors &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced r-hat and theta-hat. Putting a circumflex over a vector this way is often used to mean the unit vector in that direction.

Again, on looking at the diagram we see,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} 
\mathbf{i}= \hat{\mathbf{r}} \cos \theta  
-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \sin \theta  &amp;
\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{x}{r}\mathbf{i}+ \frac{y}{r}\mathbf{j} \\
\mathbf{j}= \hat{\mathbf{r}} \sin \theta  
+\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \cos \theta &amp; 
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} =  -\frac{y}{r}\mathbf{i} + \frac{x}{r}\mathbf{j}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Three-Dimensional Coordinates and Vectors==
===Basic definition===
Two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates as we've discussed so far can be easily extended to three-dimensions by adding one more value: 'z'.  If the standard (x,y) coordinate axes are drawn on a sheet of paper, the 'z' axis would extend upwards off of the paper.

[[File:Isometric 1.png|center|3D coordinate axes.]]

Similar to the two coordinate axes in two-dimensional coordinates, there are three '''coordinate planes''' in space.  These are the '''xy-plane''', the '''yz-plane''', and the '''xz-plane'''.  Each plane is the &quot;sheet of paper&quot; that contains both axes the name mentions.  For instance, the yz-plane contains both the y and z axes and is perpendicular to the x axis.

[[File3D Cartesian coordinates.PNG|center|Coordinate planes in space.]]

Therefore, vectors can be extended to three dimensions by simply adding the 'z' value.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

To facilitate standard form notation, we add another standard unit vector:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Again, both forms (component and standard) are equivalent.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 1 \mathbf{i} + 2 \mathbf{j} + 3 \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''Magnitude''':
Magnitude in three dimensions is the same as in two dimensions, with the addition of a 'z' term in the radicand.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;| \mathbf{u} | = \sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2 + u_z^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Three dimensions==
The polar coordinate system is extended into three dimensions with two different coordinate systems, the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems, both of which include two-dimensional or planar polar coordinates as a subset. In essence, the cylindrical coordinate system extends polar coordinates by adding an additional distance coordinate, while the spherical system instead adds an additional angular coordinate.

===Cylindrical coordinates===
[[Image:Cylindrical coordinates.svg|thumb|right|250px|a point plotted with cylindrical coordinates]]
The ''cylindrical coordinate system'' is a coordinate system that essentially extends the two-dimensional polar coordinate system by adding a third coordinate measuring the height of a point above the plane, similar to the way in which the Cartesian coordinate system is extended into three dimensions. The third coordinate is usually denoted ''h'', making the three cylindrical coordinates (''r'', θ, ''h'').

The three cylindrical coordinates can be converted to Cartesian coordinates by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
x &amp;= r \, \cos\theta \\
y &amp;= r \, \sin\theta \\
z &amp;= h.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

===Spherical coordinates===
[[Image:Spherical Coordinates (Colatitude, Longitude).svg|thumb|right|250px|A point plotted using spherical coordinates]]

Polar coordinates can also be extended into three dimensions using the coordinates (ρ, φ, θ), where ρ is the distance from the origin, φ is the angle from the z-axis (called the colatitude or zenith and measured from 0 to 180°) and θ is the angle from the x-axis (as in the polar coordinates). This coordinate system, called the ''spherical coordinate system'', is similar to the latitude and longitude system used for Earth, with the origin in the centre of Earth, the latitude δ being the complement of φ, determined by δ = 90° − φ, and the longitude ''l'' being measured by ''l'' = θ − 180°.

The three spherical coordinates are converted to Cartesian coordinates by
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
x &amp;= \rho \, \sin\phi \, \cos\theta \\
y &amp;= \rho \, \sin\phi \, \sin\theta \\
z &amp;= \rho \, \cos\phi.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2},&lt;/math&gt;   

:&lt;math&gt;\theta\ = \arctan{\frac{y}{x}},&lt;/math&gt;   

:&lt;math&gt;\phi\ = \arccos{\frac{z}{\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;

===Cross Product===
The cross product of two vectors is a [[w:determinant|determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\ u_x &amp; u_y &amp; u_z \\ v_x &amp; v_y &amp; v_z \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

and is also a [[w:pseudovector|pseudovector]].

The cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to both vectors. The magnitude of the cross product is the product of the magnitude of the vectors and the sin of the angle between them.
:&lt;math&gt; |\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}|=|\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}| \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;
This magnitude is the area of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors.

The cross product is ''linear'' and ''anticommutative''. For any numbers ''a'' and ''b'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} \times \left( a\mathbf{v} +b\mathbf{w} \right) =
a \mathbf{u} \times  \mathbf{v} +b\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} 
\quad \mathbf{u} \times  \mathbf{v} = - \mathbf{v} \times  \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

If both vectors point in the same direction, their cross product is zero.

===Triple Products===

If we have three vectors we can combine them in two ways, a triple scalar product,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and a triple vector product
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The triple scalar product is a determinant
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \cdot(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = \begin{vmatrix} 
u_x &amp; u_y &amp; u_z \\ v_x &amp; v_y &amp; v_z \\ w_x &amp; w_y &amp; w_z \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

If the three vectors are listed clockwise, looking from the origin, the sign of this product is positive. If they are listed anticlockwise the sign is negative.

The order of the cross and dot products doesn't matter.
:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}) = 
(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot \mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;

Either way, the absolute value of this product is the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the three vectors, '''u''', '''v''', and '''w'''

The triple vector product can be simplified
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})
=(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}) \mathbf{v} 
-(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This form is easier to do calculations with.

The triple vector product is '''not''' associative.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})
\ne (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

There are special cases where the two sides are equal, but in general the brackets matter. They must not be omitted.

===Three-Dimensional Lines and Planes===

We will use '''r''' to denote the position of a point.

The multiples of a vector, '''a''' all lie on a line through the origin. Adding a constant vector '''b''' will shift the line, but leave it straight, so the equation of a line is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{a}s+\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a ''parametric equation''. The position is specified in terms of the parameter ''s''.

Any linear combination of two vectors, '''a''' and '''b''' lies on a single plane through the origin, provided the two vectors are not colinear. We can shift this plane by a constant vector again and write
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{a}s+\mathbf{b}t+\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

If we choose '''a''' and '''b''' to be ''orthonormal'' vectors in the plane (i.e. unit vectors at right angles) then ''s'' and ''t'' are Cartesian coordinates for points in the plane.

These parametric equations can be extended to higher dimensions.

Instead of giving parametric equations for the line and plane, we could use constraints. E.g., for any point in the ''xy'' plane ''z=0''

For a plane through the origin, the single vector normal to the plane, '''n''', is at right angle with every vector in the plane, by definition, so
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;
is a plane through the origin, normal to '''n'''.

For planes not through the origin we get
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{r}- \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{n}=0
\quad \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{n}=\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

A line lies on the intersection of two planes, so it must obey the constraint for both planes, i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{n}=a \quad \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{m}=b&lt;/math&gt;

These constraint equations con also be extended to higher dimensions.

==Vector-Valued Functions==

Vector-Valued Functions are functions that instead of giving a resultant scalar value, give a resultant vector value.  These aid in the creation of direction and vector fields, and are therefore used in physics to aid with visualizations of electric, magnetic, and many other types of fields.  They are of the following form:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F(t)} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1(t)} \\ \mathbf{a_2(t)} \\ \mathbf{a_3(t)} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n(t)} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Introduction===

{{Calculus Stub}}

===Limits, Derivatives, and Integrals===

Put simply, the limit of a vector-valued function is the limit of its parts.

Proof:

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{F}(t) = \mathbf{L} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1} \\ \mathbf{a_2} \\ \mathbf{a_3} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;\phi &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;0 &lt;  |t-c| &lt;  \phi \implies |\mathbf{F}(t) - \mathbf{L}| &lt;  \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

But by the triangle inequality &lt;math&gt;|a_1| \le |\mathbf{F}| \le |a_1| + |a_2| + |a_3| + ... + |a_n|&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|a_1(t) - a_1| \le |\mathbf{F}(t) - \mathbf{L}|&lt;/math&gt;

So

&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; |t-c| &lt; \phi  \implies  |a_1(t) - a_1| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \rightarrow c} a_1(t) = a_1 &lt;/math&gt;
A similar argument can be used through parts a_n(t)

Now let &lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{F}(t) = \mathbf{L} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1} \\ \mathbf{a_2} \\ \mathbf{a_3} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; again, and that for any &amp;epsilon;&gt;0 there is a corresponding &amp;phi;&gt;0 such 0&lt;|t-c|&lt;&amp;phi; implies

&lt;math&gt;|a_n(t) - a_n| &lt; {\epsilon \over n} &lt;/math&gt;

Then

&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; |t-c| &lt; \phi  \implies  |\mathbf{F}(t) - \mathbf{L}| \le {\epsilon_1 \over n} + ... + {\epsilon_n \over n} = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

therefore!:

&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{F}(t) = \mathbf{L} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1} \\ \mathbf{a_2} \\ \mathbf{a_3} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{a_1(t)} \\ \lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{a_2(t)} \\ \lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{a_3(t)} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \lim_{t \rightarrow c} \mathbf{a_n(t)} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we can then create an accurate definition of a derivative of a vector-valued function:

&lt;!--I broke this up, so that it doesnt spill off over the side of the screen. May not be the best solution, but at least people don't have to scroll to see it all. --Whiteknight--&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}'(t)=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\mathbf{F}(t+h) - \mathbf{F}(t) \over h}
= \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1(t)} \\ \mathbf{a_2(t)} \\ \mathbf{a_3(t)} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n(t)} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1(t + h)} \\ \mathbf{a_2(t + h)} \\ \mathbf{a_3(t + h)} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n(t + h)} \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{a_1(t)} \\ \mathbf{a_2(t)} \\ \mathbf{a_3(t)} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{a_n(t)} \end{pmatrix} \over h} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \begin{pmatrix} \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {a_1(t+h) - a_1(t) \over h} \\ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {a_2(t+h) - a_2(t) \over h} \\ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {a_3(t+h) - a_3(t) \over h} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \mathbf{.} \\ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} {a_n(t+h) - a_n(t) \over h} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The final step was accomplished by taking what we just did with limits.

By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus integrals can be applied to the vector's components.

In other words:  the limit of a vector function is the limit of its parts, the derivative of a vector function is the derivative of its parts, and the integration of a vector function is the integration of it parts.

===Velocity, Acceleration, Curvature, and a brief mention of the Binormal===

Assume we have a vector-valued function which starts at the origin and as its independent variables changes the points that the vectors point at trace a path.

We will call this vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is commonly known as the '''position vector'''.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; then represents a position and t represents time, then in model with Physics we know the following:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}(t+h) - \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is displacement.
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}'(t) = \mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector.
&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)|&lt;/math&gt; is the speed.
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}''(t) = \mathbf{v}'(t) = \mathbf{a}(t)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration vector.

The only other vector that comes in use at times is known as the curvature vector.

The vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(t)&lt;/math&gt; used to find it is known as the unit tangent vector, which is defined as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{v}(t)}{|\mathbf{v}(t)|}&lt;/math&gt; or shorthand &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat v}&lt;/math&gt;.

The vector normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; to this then is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{T}'(t)}{|\mathbf{v}(t)|}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can verify this by taking the dot product

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{N} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Also note that &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{v}(t)| = {ds \over dt} &lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{v}{|v|} = \frac{\frac{dr}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}} = {dr \over ds}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} = \frac{\mathbf{T}'(t)}{|\mathbf{v}(t)|} = \frac{\frac{dT}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}} = {dT \over ds}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can actually verify:

&lt;math&gt;{d \over ds} ( \mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{T} )= {d \over ds} (1)  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {dT \over ds} \cdot \mathbf{T} + \mathbf{T} \cdot {dT \over ds} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2 * \mathbf{T} \cdot {dT \over ds} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} \cdot {dT \over ds} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{N} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

What this gives rise to is the '''Unit Normal Vector''' &lt;math&gt; \frac{\frac{dT}{ds}}{|\frac{dT}{ds}|} &lt;/math&gt; of which the top-most vector is the Normal vector, but the bottom half &lt;math&gt;(|\frac{dT}{ds}|)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the curvature.  Since the Normal vector points toward the inside of a curve, the sharper a turn, the Normal vector has a large magnitude, therefore the curvature has a small value, and is used as an index in civil engineering to reflect the sharpness of a curve (clover-leaf highways, for instance).

The only other thing not mentioned is the Binormal that occurs in 3-d curves &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N} = \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which is useful in creating planes parallel to the curve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yo, I added in Green's Theorem and order of integration into Multivariable Calculus, and Projection/derivatives/limits/integral/vector-valued functions/position, velocity, acceleration, tangent, normal, binormal, vectors/curvature into Vector Calculus.  However, I'm not sure how much of this scope from Vector Calculus spills into this Multivariable Calculus, what else should be added (as I don't really want to edit for grammatical errors and ordering nicety, just adding articles, since I suck at ordering and English), and where I can put independence of path or if you have that in here, at one point it looks like you do, but to be honest I can't decipher what you're trying to teach; but then again I just randomly put stuff in here also.  Anyways, what's going on/where can I read about, thanks, feedback?  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 05:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)


Just letting you know that there's already stuff/going to be stuff on [[Linear Algebra/Vectors]] for the vector stuff. If you wish to do them again here, that's ok.
In my opinion, stuff on divergence and curl and all that funky stuff, Green's theorem et al, and vector-valued functions and others should be put here. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:25, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)


I was thinking I'd quickly cover the things we need for the following sections so that this &quot;book&quot; would be sorta self-contained.  I'm new to wikibooks though, so perhaps that's not the norm? [[User:Brianluft|Brianluft]] 12:23, 6 Dec 2003 (CST)

: There aren't any concrete policies about redundant information yet.  For now, do what you feel is best :) Could you please fix up the header problem too? Or let me know when you're done and I'll do it. It looks nicer if we start at == and work down. &lt;!-- Sorry if I sound too demanding! --&gt; [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:26, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:: Done. :-)  [[User:Brianluft|Brianluft]] 12:30, 6 Dec 2003 (CST)

: By the way, should we use the same bracket notation across articles? We need to maintain consistency across mathematics pages. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:06, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:: Yeah, I think so.  I must admit I've never seen the notation in [[Linear Algebra/Vectors]], but I'll use that instead of my angled brackets notation for consistency.  [[User:Brianluft|Brianluft]] 12:34, 6 Dec 2003 (CST)
::: Thanks :) For a good reason why, see [[Linear Algebra/Linear transformations|Linear transformations]] [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:50, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:::: I disagree, that notation (the large vertical parantheses) is commonly used in combinatorics, and angled brackets are much more widely used.  Also, does the Wiki system have support for overbars/underbars, because that notation is more commonly used than bold also. Hao 11:45 13 July 2005 (JST)

How far is the scope of this page going to cover?  There aren't any sections on curl or divergence or what-have-you.  I'd be glad to fill them in, but I'm not sure exactly how far it should be taken.  It seems to me that there should really be a section on scalar fields before we hop into vector fields, though. --[[User:Eienmaru|Eienmaru]] 00:39, 15 May 2005 (UTC)

== deleted image for polar coordinates ==

I deleted an unlicensed image you were using in section &quot;Polar Coordinates&quot; but I replaced it with a similar one from Commons; you'll have to change the text in that section to match the image (ie. it doesn't use x and y as variables etc.) ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:23, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

== What about torsion? ==

&lt;nowiki&gt;Maybe the importance of the binormal should be mentioned in respect to measuring the torsion of a curve?&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Is a conversational tone OK? ==

I find many parts of this wikibook are kind of hard to follow, solely because of their lack of descriptive prose. Is it alright to write in a conversational tone, as an instructor would speak to students? (using 'you', for example) or is this too inconsistent and hard to reproduce for the wiki format?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Lisp''' is a programming language. It is named after the collapsed phrase '''Lis'''t '''P'''rocessing.

If you have programmed before and would like to see a little bit of how Lisp works and is different from other programming languages, you can get an [[/Overview|overview]].

==Dialects==
Because Lisp itself is, technically, just nine operators, to become a useful language, much more needs to be implemented atop it. [[Common Lisp]] and [[Scheme]] are two such designs to create a useful programming language. 

'''[[Common Lisp]]''' is an ANSI standard, and features an extensive array of library functions. It is the more widely-used of the two. 

'''[[Scheme]]''' is designed in a minimalistic fashion, with a very small amount of built in functions. This is probably true, but Scheme lacks many of the time-saving built-in functions of Common Lisp.

[[Emacs/Introduction_to_Emacs_Lisp|'''Emacs Lisp''']] is a implementation of Lisp in [[Emacs]].

[[Introduction to newLISP|'''newLISP''']] is a Lisp-like, general-purpose scripting language

In short, the basic alphabet of the Finnish language: 
{{audio|Fi-aakkoset.ogg|Aakkoset: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z å ä ö }}

----
'''Finnish''' is a very '''phonetic''' language, as every pronunciation has its own letter. That is to say that things are &quot;pronounced exactly as they are written&quot; so [[w:SAMPA|SAMPA]] and [[w:IPA|IPA]] notations of Finnish words are almost identical to the written language. However, do not take this too literally; there are certainly many details in speech that cannot be easily expressed in written language, and Finnish is no exception.

The glyphs 'ä' and 'ö' have been borrowed from Swedish. They are independent letters and phonemes (sounds), not modified nor accented letters. Changing 'Ä' into 'A' or 'Ö' into 'O' is akin to changing 'O' into 'Q'.

* Ä is similar to the following bolded sounds in English: ''&quot;A f'''a'''t p'''a'''ncake m'''a'''n s'''a'''t on a c'''a'''t.&quot;''
* Ö is similar to the following bolded sounds in British English: ''&quot;G'''ir'''ls all over the w'''or'''ld tried to fig'''ure''' out what all the w'''or'''ds mean until a consensus was reached that it cannot be w'''or'''ked out.&quot;''

Go through each of the letters of the alphabet and practice saying them:

Like most other [[wikipedia:en:Indo-European languages|Indo-European languages]], and unlike Chinese or Japanese, almost everything in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] depends on number, which may be either plural or singular (pojedyncza and mnoga).

Let's take a look at verbs first.

| To drive || jadę || jedziesz || jedzie || jedziemy
| jedziecie || jadą
|-
| To give || daję || dajesz || daje || dajemy
| dajecie || dają
|}

And some nouns:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Gender
&lt;th rowspan=2&gt;Meaning
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Singular
&lt;th colspan=2&gt;Plural
|-
! Nominative
&lt;th&gt;Accusative
! Nominative
&lt;th&gt;Accusative

| Feminine || Girl || Dziewczyna

|-
| Inanimate-masculine || Computer || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Komputer
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Komputery
|}

As you can see, with the exception of person-masculine, the nominative and accusative are the same in the plural (in the person masculine accusatives are the same as genitives).

Like in other Indo-European languages, the verb agrees with the subject.
* Basia ma chomiki. - Basia has (owns) hamsters.
* Dziewczyny mają komputer. - The girls have a computer.
* Koty piją mleko. - The cats are drinking milk.

There are seven cases of noun and adjective declension in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]].
So far we have only introduced the nominative (''mianownik'') and the accusative (''biernik''), in [[Polish:Basic sentences 1]]. The whole list, in traditional order, is:
* [[Wikipedia:Nominative|Nominative]] (''mianownik'')
* [[Wikipedia:Genitive|Genitive]] (''dopełniacz'')
* [[Wikipedia:Dative|Dative]] (''celownik'')
* [[Wikipedia:Accusative|Accusative]] (''biernik'')
* [[Wikipedia:Instrumental_case|Instrumental]] (''narzędnik'')
* [[Wikipedia:Locative|Locative]] (''miejscownik'')
* [[Wikipedia:Vocative|Vocative]] (''wołacz'')


== Nominative ==

No need to memorize endings as nouns and modifiers in this case. Use the basic, unmarked, dictionary forms.

* Indicates the '''subject''' of a sentence.
** Gosia pisze książkę. - Gosia is writing a book. (Gosia in nominative because she is the subject of the sentence)

* Used for most '''lone adjectives''' and sentences of the type '''&quot;To jest X&quot;.'''
** Piotr jest przystojny. - Piotr is handsome. (przystojny is in the nominative)
** To jest moja żona. - This is my wife. (moja żona is in the nominative)

== Genitive ==
 
* Used to indicate '''possession'''. Often corresponds to English ''''s''' or '''of''':
** Adam widzi kota Agnieszk'''i''' - Adam sees Agnieszka''''s''' cat (Agnieszka in genitive)
** Kot Piotr'''a''' pije mleko - Piotr''''s''' cat drinks milk (Piotr in genitive)

* Used with units or amounts:
** puszka piw'''a''' - a can '''of''' beer (Beer in genitive)

* Used after '''certain prepositions''' such as ''dla'', ''do'', ''od''.

* Used for the '''direct object in a negative sentence''' (Only if the positive sentence would use the accusative!):
** Kot pije mleko - The cat drinks milk. (Milk in the accusative)
** Kot nie pije mlek'''a''' - The cat doesn't drink milk. (Milk in genitive)
** Agnieszka jest dziewczyną - Agnieszka is a girl. (Girl in instrumental)
** Adam nie jest dziewczyną - Adam is not a girl. (Girl remains in the instrumental)
** Agnieszka daje kotu mleko - Agnieszka gives milk to the cat (Milk in the accusative, cat in the dative)
** Agnieszka nie daje kotu mlek'''a''' - Agnieszka doesn't give milk to the cat (Milk is now in the genitive, cat still in the dative).

== Dative ==

* Indicates the '''indirect object'''. '''To whom''' something is given, or action '''for''' somebody:
** Basia daje kot'''u''' mleko - Basia gives milk '''to''' the cat. (Cat is in the dative.)
** Znajdę '''ci''' dom. - I'll find you a house ('''for you''').

* After '''certain verbs''', like '''dziękować ''komuś''''' (to thank someone), '''pomóc ''komuś''''' (to help someone), '''wierzyć ''komuś''''' (to believe someone)

* '''expressions''' of the type: 
** Jest '''mi''' zimno - I'm cold
** Jest '''nam''' smutno - We're feeling sad
** Będzie '''wam''' trudniej... - It will be more difficult for you guys...
** Śniło '''jej''' się, że... - She dreamt that...

* when something is taken away or something befalls someone
** Zdechł '''im''' pies - Their dog died
** Wzięli '''mi''' komputer - They took away my computer
** Zgasła moj'''emu''' sąsiad'''owi''' nadzieja - My neighbor's hopes were extinguished.

== Accusative ==
* Indicates the '''direct object''' of the sentence 
** Piotr kocha Kasi'''ę'''. - Piotr loves Kasia.
** Bożena spiewa piosenk'''ę'''. - Bożena is singing a song.

* Used with some prepositions to indicate a '''motion/change''' (Note that the same preposition + locative or, more rarely the instrumental, indicates a state/condition )
** &quot;na stole&quot; - on the table (a state/condition, so you need to use the locative)
** &quot;na stół&quot; - onto the table (motion, so accusative)
** &quot;na poczcie&quot; - at the post office (state/condition so locative)
** &quot;na pocztę&quot; - to the post office (motion so accusative)
** &quot;pod stołem&quot; - under the table (a state/condition, pod is one of those prepostions which take the instrumental, not the locative)
** &quot;pod stół&quot; - towards and under the table (motion so accusative)

'''Exception:''' The preposition &quot;w&quot; (in) takes the locative when indicating a state/condition, but to imply change you must use the preposition &quot;do&quot; + genitive. 
* &quot;Jestem w sklepie&quot; (I am in the shop), but &quot;Idę do sklepu&quot; (I am going to the shop) instead of &quot;Idę w sklep&quot;.

== Instrumental ==

* Indicates the '''tool''' or '''means'''
** Basia jedzie samochod'''em''' - Basia is driving a car. (The car is the tool or means so it needs to be in the instrumental)

* A few prepositions, like &quot;z&quot; (&quot;with&quot;) or &quot;za&quot;:
** Adam jest z Basi'''ą''' - Adam is with Basia (May either mean &quot;in this moment&quot;, or more permanently, for example as boy- and girlfriend.)

* With certain verbs '''&quot;być&quot;''' (to be), '''&quot;zostać&quot;''' (to become), '''&quot;interesować się czymś/kimś&quot;''' (to be interested in something): 
** Basia jest dziewczyn'''ą''' - Basia is a girl. 
** Adam jest chłopak'''iem''' - Adam is a boy.
** Marzena interesuje się mod'''ą''' - Marzena is interested in fashion.
** Piotr jest przystojny'''m''' chłopak'''iem'''. - Piotr is a handsome guy.


Exceptions: Most '''lone adjectives''' and '''&quot;To jest X&quot;.'''
* Piotr jest przystojny. - Piotr is handsome. (przystojny is in the nominative)
* To jest moja żona. - This is my wife. (moja żona is in the nominative)

== Locative ==

* Never used alone, only in connection with '''certain prepositions, like &quot;w&quot; (in) and &quot;o&quot; (about)'''. 
** Chłopak myśli o dziewczyn'''ie''' - The boy is thinking about the girl.
** Adam jest w bank'''u'''. - Adam is in the bank.


== Vocative==

* Used '''to address someone directly''' 

* Often replaced by the nominative in colloquial language, however the vocative remains common in the following situations:
** To address someone in a rude or offensive manner (A phrase like ''ty kretyn'''ie'''!'' (&quot;you cretin!&quot;) or ''ty idiot'''o''''' (&quot;you idiot!&quot;) can only be expressed in the vocative, never in the nominative).
** In formal situations, ''Panie ''Kazimierz'''u''''', niech pan przyniesie te klucze.''
** In affectionate contexts, such as ''Kocham Cię Krzys'''iu'''!'' (&quot;I love you, Chris!&quot;)

Only masculine and feminine singulars have a separate form. 


Before declension tables are provided, let's take a look at adjectives:

The adjective (''przymiotnik'') is a very powerful part of speech in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]].
It declines very regularly depending on case, number and gender.
It may be used as a noun. For example Polish adjectives &quot;bogaty&quot; (rich) and &quot;czarny&quot; (black) are very often used as &quot;nouns&quot; (taking forms &quot;bogata&quot; and &quot;czarna&quot; in feminine gender).

While there is only one pattern, final consonant group takes different endings.

The vocative always has the same form as the nominative.

= Feminine noun declension =

The declension of nouns in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] is less regular than of adjectives, but follows a pattern that is in many ways similar to adjective declension.

Let's take a look at a few typical feminine declension nouns in singular and are equal to nominative in plural):

As you can see it's quite regular. Possible changes are:
* &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;softening of final consonant group in the singular dative and locative (which have the same form)&lt;/font&gt;
* &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;change of &quot;o&quot; to &quot;ó&quot; (pronounced /u/) in the plural genitive&lt;/font&gt;
* &lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;insertion of &quot;e&quot; between the two final consonants in the plural genitive.&lt;/font&gt; You may think of this &quot;e&quot; as a kind of aid to pronunciation. &quot;mrówk&quot; would be pretty hard to say without this &quot;e&quot;. The Polish language allows quite complicated consonant groups at the the beginning of a syllable, but it tries to avoid complex syllable endings.

These changes aren't specific to the feminine noun declension - they happen throughout the Polish language, so you'd better get used to them.

A bit less typical are feminine nouns that end in &quot;-ia&quot;:

Notice that in the genitive and the accusative the pronunciation is the same in the singular and plural.
This is not usual in Polish, and may cause some problems if number is not obvious from context. One solution is to overemphasise difference between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ę&quot; in speech (which are usually pronounced the same at word endings).
A better solution is to use some adjective or pronoun, for example:
* &quot;tej komedii&quot; (singular genitive, of this comedy)
* &quot;tych komedii&quot; (plural genitive, of these comedies)
* &quot;tę komedię&quot; (singular accusative, this comedy)
* &quot;te komedie&quot; (plural accusative, these comedies)

And abstract feminine nouns ending in &quot;-ść&quot; (note vocative forms):

There is some magic here with &quot;ść&quot; changing to &quot;śc&quot; but it's only spelling.
You never write the softened version of a consonant before a vowel - you change it to the &quot;normal&quot; version and add &quot;i&quot; to mark it as &quot;soft&quot;. You don't have to add &quot;i&quot; if it's already there.

Without this magic endings would look like:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!  
&lt;th&gt;Singular          
! Plural
|- align=&quot;center&quot;

|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Instrumental  
| '''ią''' || '''iami'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
! Locative  
| '''i''' || '''iach'''
|}

Let's try to use that knowledge in practice.
* Agnieszka myśli o miłości - Agnieszka thinks about love (love in locative)
* Agnieszka nie myśli o miłości - Agnieszka doesn't think about love (as above)
* Dziewczyny lubią komedie - The girls like comedies (comedies in accusative)
* Kobieta pije kawę - The woman is drinking coffee. (coffee in accusative)
* Dziewczyna nie pije kawy - The girl doesn't drink coffee (coffee in genitive)
* Basia nie widzi krów - Basia doesn't see cows (cows in genitive)
* Marta nie lubi mrówek - Marta doesn't like ants (ants in genitive)

* myśli - third person singular form of &quot;to think&quot;
* lubi - third person singular form of &quot;to like&quot;
* lubią - third person plural form of &quot;to like&quot;

= Masculine noun declension =

There are three masculine genders in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] - person-masculine, animate-masculine and inanimate-masculine. The differences between them are regular:
* In the case of inanimate-masculine, the accusative has the same form as the  nominative
* In the case of person-masculine, the accusative has the same form as the genitive
* In the case of animate-masculine, the accusative has the same form as the genitive in the singular, but as the nominative in the plural
* Vocative singular is always the same as locative singular and vocative plural is the same as nominative plural.

But there are also some other differences in declension.
Before they get explained, let's take a look at some examples.

Phonetic changes and irregularities are:
* &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;All &quot;e&quot; (or &quot;ie&quot;) and &quot;o&quot;/&quot;ó&quot; changes in the singular nominative, and also the accusative if it has the same form as the nominative.&lt;/font&gt;
* The plural nominative isn't very regular. &lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;In the case of some nouns softening of the final consonant may be required.&lt;/font&gt; Some nouns even have two correct plural nominative forms - one with &quot;owie&quot; and another in a soft &quot;e&quot;.
* Some nouns have a singular locative in &quot;u&quot;, other have in &quot;e&quot;, and in the case of the latter &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;the final consonant group must be softened.&lt;/font&gt;
* Very few masculine nouns have a singular dative in &quot;u&quot; instead in &quot;owi&quot;. However, they are really common words - Pan (literally lord, nobleman, master - a very important word because it is used exactly as the English pronoun &quot;You&quot; to express politeness e.g &quot;Podać Panu kawę? Could you take some coffee, sir?)  brat (brother), kot (cat), pies (dog) and Bóg (God). As you see, apart from unusual dative ending in all of them declension is connected with unpleasant stem alternations, resulting from various historical processes e.g. consonant cluster softening, compensatory lengthening, development of Slavonic semi-vowels (jery)    
* Some inanimate-masculine nouns have a singular genitive in &quot;u&quot;, most others in &quot;a&quot;.

Now some sentences:
* Pies jest pod stołem - The dog is under the table. (table in instrumental)
* Chłopak nie ma psa - The boy doesn't have a dog. (dog in genitive)
* Facet daje kotu mleko - The man gives milk to the cat. (cat in dative)
* Adam jest rolnikiem - Adam is a farmer. (farmer in instrumental)

The neuter gender in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] is least common. Many neuter words end in &quot;-o&quot; and their declension is somewhat similar to inanimate-masculine.

The archaic instrumental '''oczyma''' doesn't have much to do with the neuter gender - it was the Indoeuropean dual number (for a pair of things), which disappeared in almost all modern Indo-European languages. You can still find it in some expressions.

&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;In the singular locative &quot;krześle&quot; you can see how softening works on a group of consonants - all consonants are softened, in that case &quot;s&quot; changes to &quot;ś&quot; and &quot;ł&quot; to &quot;l&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;As with other declensions, &quot;e&quot; may appear between two final consonants if there is no vowel after them (&quot;null&quot; ending).&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#008000&quot;&gt;The plural instrumental is &quot;-ami&quot;/&quot;-iami&quot; in almost all nouns, and &quot;-imi&quot;/&quot;-ymi&quot; in almost all adjectives. Here you can see one of the exceptions. For some weird historical reasons &quot;a&quot; disappeared and we have &quot;-ćmi&quot; instead of the expected &quot;-ciami&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;

In the case of &quot;dziecko&quot;, &quot;oko&quot; and &quot;ucho&quot; you can see that a slightly different form is used as the base for the singular and plural forms. This is also quite archaic.

If you find some neuter noun, try to decline it rather like &quot;piwo&quot;, &quot;krzesło&quot; and &quot;ciastko&quot; rather than like &quot;dziecko&quot;, &quot;oko&quot; or &quot;ucho&quot;.

Examples:
* Dziecko je ciastka - child eats cakes (cake in accusative)
* Dzieci nie piją piwa - children don't drink beer (beer in genitive)
* Oczy Piotra są zielone - Piotr's eyes are green (eyes in nominative, Piotr in genitive, green in nominative)
* Kot jest na krześle - cat is on chair (chair in locative)

* zielone - plural neuter form of adjective &quot;green&quot;

Adjectives in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] may be used in many ways, including:
* in constructs &quot;X is Y&quot;
* as nouns
* as describing words for nouns, usually placed before nouns

The English &quot;X is Y&quot; has many meanings. If Y is a noun, it usually means that X is a member of some class, for example &quot;Kasia jest dziewczyną&quot; (Kasia is a girl). In that case Y should be used in the instumentative. But if Y is an adjective, it means a completely different thing - that Y has a certain feature. For example &quot;Kot jest czarny&quot; (cat is black) doesn't mean that cat is member of class of black things. To mark that this is a different situation the nominative is used for Y. In the case of adjectives that can be used as nouns both cases may be used, but the nominative is much more common.

Conjugation of the verb &quot;to be&quot;:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;

!
&lt;th&gt;Singular
! Plural
|-
! First person
| jestem || jesteśmy
|-
! Second person
| jesteś || jesteście
|-
! Third person

|}

* Agnieszka jest ładna - Agnieszka is pretty
* Kot Basi jest czarny - Basia's cat is black
* Krowy rolnika są białe - The farmer's cows are white
* Jestem wysoki - I'm tall
* Jesteś gruby - You're fat (singular you)
* Jesteśmy młodzi - We're young
* Jesteście bogaci - You're rich (plural you)

Adjectives used and their antonyms, in the feminine singular nominative
* ładna - pretty
* brzydka - ugly
* czarna - black
* biała - white
* wysoka - tall/high
* niska - short (height)
* gruba - thick/fat
* chuda - thin
* młoda - young
* stara - old
* bogata - rich
* biedna - poor

Some examples with adjectives used as nouns:
* Czarni lubią muzykę - black people like music (the fact that it's black people discussed must be found out from context)
* Basia lubi czarną - Basia likes black coffee (of course it could have also been in the context of &quot;pornography&quot;)
* Bogaci lubią golf - rich people like golf


If an adjective describes some noun, it has to be used in the same case, number and gender as the noun.
Here are some examples:
* Biały kot pije mleko - A white cat drinks milk (white in nominative)
* Ładna dziewczyna ma białego kota - The pretty girl has a white cat (pretty in nominative, white in accusative)
* Gruby chłopak nie ma czarnego kota - The fat boy doesn't have a black cat (fat in nominative, black in genitive)
* Czarne oczy Marty są ładne - Marta's black eyes are pretty (black and pretty in nominative)
* Dorota jest stara - Dorota is old (old in nominative)
* Dorota jest starą kobietą - Dorota is an old woman (old in instrumental)

You can also stack adjectives:
* Basia ma grubego czarnego kota - Basia has a fat black cat (fat and black in accusative)

      <comment>Polish has no definite article. But English does. What's more, English has aspects: simple and continous. Polish works a little differently</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">We often want to group nouns or sentences, to say &quot;X and Y&quot; or &quot;X or Y&quot;.

In [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] the commonly used word for &quot;and&quot; is &quot;i&quot;:
* Marta i Basia mają koty - Marta and Basia have cats
* Kobieta je ciastko i pije kawę - The woman is eating a cookie and drinking coffee
* Kot jest gruby i czarny - The cat is fat and black
* Adam lubi Martę i Basię - Adam likes Marta and Basia

The word &quot;oraz&quot; may also be used to express English &quot;and&quot;:
* Basia ma kota oraz psa - Basia has a cat and a dog.
It sounds a little more sophisticated. However, you shouldn't use ''oraz'' inbetween adjectives - &quot;Kot jest gruby '''oraz''' czarny&quot; doesn't sound very natural. When in doubt, say &quot;i&quot;.

You can also use &quot;z&quot; + instrumental (with) and &quot;bez&quot; (without) + genitive
* Magda z Tomkiem są małżeństwem - Magda and Tomek are married (Tomek in instrumental)
* Magda i Tomek są małżeństwem - Same.
* Dziecko lubi kanapki z serem - The child likes sandwiches with cheese (cheese in instrumental) - meaning &quot;The child likes cheese sandwiches&quot;
* Dziecko lubi kanapki i ser - The child likes sandwiches and cheese - this one meaning &quot;The child likes both sandwiches and cheese&quot;
* Kobieta lubi kawę bez cukru - The woman likes her coffee without sugar (sugar in genitive) - we don't say &quot;her coffee&quot; in Polish, just &quot;coffee&quot;

* małżeństwo - married couple
* kanapka - a sandwich
* ser - cheese
* cukier - sugar
* Tomek - popular male name, diminuitive of Tomasz - the English equivalent is Thomas

When you group a few nouns, the result will always be plural, and if any of them was person-masculine, so will the whole expression be.

There are many words for &quot;or&quot; - we mostly use &quot;albo&quot; or &quot;lub&quot; (the same meaning), but &quot;czy&quot; (which usually has a different meaning) may be used for this purpose too, especially in questions.

* Masz kota albo psa? - &quot;Do you have a cat or dog ?&quot; Proper answers are &quot;tak&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;, if you have either or even both) or &quot;nie&quot; (&quot;no&quot;, if you have neither)
* Masz kota czy psa? - &quot;Do you have a cat, or a dog?&quot;, meaning &quot;Which do you have, cat or dog?&quot;. Proper answers are &quot;kota&quot; (&quot;a cat&quot;, if you have a cat but not a dog), or &quot;psa&quot; (&quot;a dog&quot;, if you have a dog but not a cat). If you have both or neither some more complex answer will be needed. But &quot;tak&quot;/&quot;nie&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot;) will leave the other party rather confused.
* Marta albo Basia ma kota - Marta or Basia has a cat
* Adam ma kota albo psa - Adam has a cat or a dog
* Dziecko je ciasto albo pije mleko - The child is eating cake or drinking milk.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]], sometimes yes/no questions are created by a rising tone, which is indicated by a question mark:
* Basia ma kota - Basia has a cat.
* Basia ma kota? - Does Basia have a cat?

However, this is more or less to the equivalent of saying in English: &quot;Basia has a cat?&quot; 

Another way to form a question is by using the word 'czy'. This makes it slightly more formal and also easier to understand for foreigners.
* Czy Basia ma kota? - Does Basia have a cat?

Specific questions are created by question pronouns like:
* gdzie - where
* kiedy - when
* kto - who
* co - what
* ile - how much
* jaka - what kind
* która - which
* jak - how

&quot;kto&quot; and &quot;co&quot; behave like nouns (but they don't have number) and &quot;jaka&quot; and &quot;która&quot; like adjectives, so you must use them in their proper form.

A question pronoun is usually moved to the beginning of a sentence, even if it replaces something that would usually be at the end, like an object.

* Kogo lubi Basia? - who does Basia like? (who in accusative and moved to beginning of sentence). Emphasis on &quot;Basia&quot;
* Kogo Basia lubi? - also correct but emphasis on &quot;to like&quot;
* Co pije dziecko? - what does a child drink? (&quot;what&quot; is in accusative), emphasis is on &quot;dziecko&quot;
* Co dziecko pije? - also correct but emphasis is on &quot;to drink&quot;
* Kogo lubisz? - Who do you like? (&quot;who&quot; is in the accusative)
* Z kim rozmawiasz? - who are you talking with? (&quot;who&quot; in instrumental)
* O czym myślisz?  - what are you thinking about? (&quot;what&quot; in locative)
* Gdzie jest ciastko? - where is the cake?
* Gdzie są dziewczyny? - where are the girls?
* Którą dziewczynę lubisz? - which girl do you like? (&quot;which&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; in accusative)
* Jaką pijesz kawę? - what kind of coffee do you drink? (&quot;what kind&quot; in accusative). May mean either &quot;What kind of coffee are you drinking?&quot; or &quot;What kind of coffee do you like?&quot; (and drink usually)

* rozmawiasz - second person singular of verb &quot;to talk&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two classes of verbs in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]] - '''perfective''' verbs to talk about actions that are completed or will be completed, and '''imperfective''' verbs for actions that are taking place in some moment (no indication of completion). Very often they form pairs.

Perfective verbs don't have a present tense - if something is already done you must use the past tense and if it's not - the future tense. This &quot;future perfective&quot; tense is identical in form to the present tense. Let's take the imperfective and perfective verbs for &quot;to drink&quot;:
* Kot pije mleko - &quot;The cat drinks milk&quot; or &quot;The cat is drinking milk now&quot;, pije is an imperfective verb
* Kot wypije mleko - &quot;The cat will drink (all the) milk&quot;, wypije is a perfective verb

To form other tenses besides the present and future perfective we need two more verb forms - the infinitive and the participle.

The infinitive usually ends with &quot;-ć&quot;. The participle depends on the subject's number and gender:

&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;mieli&lt;/font&gt;

| myśli || myśleć || myślała || myślał
| myślało
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;myśleli&lt;/font&gt;
| myślały
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Perfective || pomyśli || pomyśleć || pomyślała || pomyślał
| pomyślało
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;pomyśleli&lt;/font&gt;
| pomyślały
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Imperfective || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | To drive
| jedzie || jechać || jechała || jechał
| jechało || jechali || jechały
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Perfective || pojedzie || pojechać || pojechała || pojechał
| pojechało || pojechali || pojechały
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Imperfective || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | To do / to make
| robi || robić || robiła || robił || robiło || robili || robiły
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Perfective || zrobi || zrobić || zrobiła || zrobił
| zrobiło || robili || zrobiły
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Imperfective || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | To earn
| zarabia || zarabiać || zarabiała || zarabiał
| zarabiało || zarabiali || zarabiały
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| Perfective || zarobi || zarobić || zarobiła || zarobił
| zarobiło || zarobili || zarobiły
|}

Very often a perfective verb is formed from the imperfective by some prefix.
Another class of pairs is verbs which are already derived from some other verb by prefixing. In Polish double prefixing is very rare, so an alternative form of base verb is used with the same prefix.

Participles usually have regular endings showing the number and tense of the verb's subject:  &quot;ła&quot;, &quot;ł&quot;, &quot;ło&quot;, &quot;li&quot;, &quot;ły&quot;.
&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;In some cases &quot;a&quot; also changes to &quot;e&quot; in the plural person-masculine, where a softened consonant is used. This is one of the typical features of the Polish language, and it can also be found in other places, for example the locative of the noun &quot;miasto&quot; (city) is &quot;mieście&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;

The future imperfective is formed by the future form of the verb &quot;to be&quot; (equivalent to &quot;will&quot; in English) and either the third person form of the participle or simply the infinitive. The participial form is more common, however, if you're unsure of the correct ending, just use the infinitive.

!
&lt;th&gt;Singular

| Second person || będziesz || będziecie

|}

* Basia będzie czytać książkę - Basia will be reading a book.
* Basia będzie czytała książkę - also correct
* Basia przeczyta książkę - Basia will read the (whole) book
* Dziecko będzie jadło ciastko - &quot;The child will be eating a cake&quot;, or &quot;The child will eat part of cake&quot; (it might eat the whole cake, but the sentence doesn't specify this)
* Dziecko będzie jeść ciastko - also correct
* Dziecko zje ciastko - the child will eat the (whole) cake
* Zrobisz obiad? - will you make dinner? (question about effect or result, that is dinner. Contains implied expectation of completion of action)
* Będziesz robić obiad? - will you make dinner? (question about action. No indication if dinner is expected to be completed)


You can also use the verb &quot;to be&quot; on its own:
* Ciastko będzie smaczne - The cake will be tasty (the cake probably hasn't been made yet, but when it is made, it will be tasty)
* Basia będzie mamą - Basia will be a mother (Basia is pregnant)
* Adam będzie inżynierem - Adam will be an engineer (maybe he's studying engineering)


Past tenses - past perfective and past imperfective - were originally formed in a similar way, but later the auxiliary verb merged with the participle.
The Polish past perfective doesn't have anything to do with the English perfect tense - it's used for completed actions and is more similar to the English simple past.

The participle alone is the correct third person past tense:

* Basia zrobiła kawę - Basia made coffee (past perfective tense, important thing is that coffee is available now)
* Basia robiła kawę - Basia was making coffee (past imperfective tense, answer for &quot;what was Basia doing when you last saw her&quot; or &quot;what is all that mess in the kitchen&quot;. No indication if the action was completed.)

In first and second person you have to add:
* First person singular - &quot;m&quot;
* Second person singular - &quot;ś&quot;
* First person plural - &quot;śmy&quot;
* Second person plural - &quot;ście&quot;

Note that for the masculine singular (&quot;-ł&quot;) you have to add an extra &quot;-e-&quot;:
* zrobił'''e'''m kawę - I made coffee (masculine I)
* zrobiłam kawę - I made coffee (feminine I)
* zrobił'''e'''ś kawę - you made coffee (singular masculine you)
* zrobiłaś kawę - you made coffee (singular feminine you)
* zrobiłyśmy kawę - we made coffee (... and we are all girls)
* zrobiliśmy kawę -  we made coffee (... and there is at least one man among us)

There is also a tense to mark something that happened before a given event in the past, like the English &quot;pluperfect&quot;, but it's very archaic now and rarely used in modern Polish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Prepositions as hints to declensions==

Prepositions, which generally show some sort of literal or figurative relationship between events, very rarely overlap exactly between different languages, both in literal and figurative usages. For example, to a non-native English speaker, it is not obvious why we ''talk about'' something, rather than talk ''on'', ''at'', or ''in'' something. 

The correspondence shown below between some key Polish and English prepositions  should '''not''' be taken as a relation in terms of meaning (semantics); it is only a rough approximation. 

However, in [[Basic Polish language course|Polish]], both the choice of verb and the preposition (the Polish preposition, of course) are constrained by the declension. Once you develop some intuition as to which preposition you should use, or which declension, the relation between these can be used to guess the declension from the preposition or vice versa. Common links are as follows.

Note that some prepositions, these regarding to place, can be used with two possible cases. Usually, a locative or instrumental are used when the acting takes place in this place and accusative when it is going towards the place. Compare:
:Kot siedzi na stole. - The cat sits on the table. (table - locative)
:Kot wskakuje na stół. - The cat jumps onto the table. (table - accusative)
:Kot nie wskakuje na stół. - The cat doesn't jump onto the table. (table still in accusative, not genitive, because it is not an object here!)

I'm glad you liked HSE so much! I'm trying my best to do a good job, but as so often is the case in my first drafts, glaring spelling and grammar mistakes seem to plague my work. Lucky you pick them out for me.

I do not know enough about Lisp, Prolog, Scheme (never heard of it) or Haskell to decide whether they are suitable for high school students or not. If you think a coherent course can be taught using one of those languages, then please go ahead! Create a new chapte if you have to. But I was thinking of teaching a more conventional language like Pascal. Anyway we are not just writing about programming, but mathematical programming. Haskell seems to be a good choice, but where can I find a good programming IDE/compiler for it? I simply haven't done the research.

And nice to meet you. How do you do?[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

: Just being a stickybeak, but
:* If you want Haskell, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler is an excellent Windows/*nix based Haskell interpreter and compiler environment. Some systems may only run the Hugs system. I'm about to go to bed so I can't give you an exact link but I'm sure you can google it :)
:* Haskell is a good choice of language for pure, functional programming. It's not quite the best language for exploring mathematical concepts in since it's a strict functional programming language. You may want to concentrate on looking at programming in common Computer Algebra systems such as Maple and Mathematica (I do know both systems, but Mathematica's better) for stuff like numerical approximations and all that funky jazz. Haskell is nice for exploring recursion, but more conventional looping structures are easier taught in some other language. With teaching Mathematica (You guys should still have it at Sydney, right?) you get the best of both worlds, really.
: HTH :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:59, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:''Think free. Learn free.'' is the Wikibooks concept, but Mathematica seems to be a commercial thing. I wouldn't encourage people to use a propriety language on Wikibooks. Wikipedia: [[w:Lisp programming language]] [[w:Scheme programming language]] [[w:Haskell programming language]] [[w:Maple computer algebra system]] [[w:Mathematica]] [[w:Maxima]] [[w:Computer algebra system]] [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 19:58, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: It doesn't mean we can't teach non-free software, at all. And it's not exactly proprietary software either - it's well used. I merely mention this to Xiaodai as an option. In any case, are we to forbid the creation of a Windows guidebook here because it is non-free software? We cannot be bigoted on the forbidding of teaching ''just'' because of its origins now, can we? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:43, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: A Windows guidebook would be created for users of Windows who wish to (manipulate/configure/whatever) their installation. By teaching Mathematica in a textbook not created ''specifically'' for teaching Mathematica, that is encouraging people to use Mathematica. Lisp, Scheme, Ruby, Haskell seem different to me - it is hard to make any money out of them (plenty of compilers or interpreters are free already) so it's offering a choice of compiler, etc. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 21:55, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

: That's fine, and I understand where you're coming from. However to simply restrict our choice of teaching tool because the product is commercial is not a necessarily good thing - Lisp, Scheme, Ruby and Haskell are fine programming languages, but they are just that -- ''programming languages''. Haskell and other functional programming languages have mathematical groundings, but we aren't teaching lambda-calculus, we're teaching how to obtain numerical solutions to things. For this, Haskell and its ilk are not suited for this and an imperative language is better suited. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:59, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)
----
I think it's best not to use any commercial software, most high school students do not have access to them. The ideal choice would be something like Free Pascal, C++ or Java (something platform independent). [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

: If you want to go down that path, C's your best choice. But to ''properly'' teach ''good'' C and not just C's nuts and bolts of C you really have to get into the details. I wouldn't suggest OO languages because it's just not necessary. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:47, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::Agree 100%. Still think Pascal is a good choice though -- my first love. Let this be undecided until we decide to start writing it. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

:::Pascal...not so sure on this one. I'll think of this some more, too. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:24, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::::We can't decide to start writing it until we decide what programming language to use! I think C is pretty complicated, with all the #includes and things before the code bulk. I prefer Scheme (simplified Lisp) because I can just type stuff in the top frame and execute it in the bottom. I could also type straight into the bottom. (I'm talking about [http://www.drscheme.org/ DrScheme], which runs on Windows 95+, Mac OS Classic or X, and Linux). [http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/mzscheme/ MzScheme], the core of DrScheme, can be run seperately. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 12:40, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::::: Okay, we know you like Scheme! :) C's not too complicated, really. It can be rote-taught. If one is trying to learn C ''proper'' it can be a bit more difficult. 
::::: The reason why I don't think Scheme is best here is because it's a functional programming language and is simply not best suited for performing certain tasks which this chapter will probably aim to try and tackle.
::::: If you want to teach Scheme, why not start at [[Computer programming]] and start a new chapter? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:48, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I have no love for teaching any programming language proper, I don't think that's the way to learn programming. We will go into the practical aspects head first. And for that reason, I want to find a language with as few boiler-plates as possible. For ''C'', we will only need #include &lt;stdio&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; so I don't think that's a problem. As for Scheme, I haven't tried it yet(soon will). This is still a pretty much undecided matter.

::On an aside note, I have soon come to realize that someone learning C by &quot;osmosis&quot;, so to speak, means that they will only produce inefficient, buggy, and just plain bad code. ''Garbage in, garbage out'', they say!... For reasons why this is so, I could write a short book, but anyway, that's beside the point :)
:: I was thinking we could teach GNU Maxima (I think the syntax is like Maple's), but I have no experience in Maxima whatsoever, yet I do with Maple, Mathematica and C.

----
R3m0t, you should wait till we have some sort of consensus on which language we are to use ''before'' we start writing the programming section here. We work by consensus at the Wikipedia, we should do so here. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 02:01, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:I agree with Dysprosia on this one. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

== Teach C ==
We shall use C as the language for this chapter. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 05:55, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Heavy editing ==
I will have to heavily edit the intro to programming section, because i feel it has too many things that are potentially confusing and is giving to much irrelevant information to the reader. I want a minimalist approach to this chapter, we will not be attempting to teach the user how to program properly. They can read other materials if they want to do that. We want this chapter to have a mathematical focus, rather than a computer science/computing one. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 06:02, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Pseudocode? ==

It seems there has been a heated debate about which programming language to use, here's my two cents: Afterall, we're teaching the method of programming to study and explore mathematical problems, right? It's the technique, the algorithm that matters, not the programming language. Maybe we can use pseudocode here. And when later we've a majority opinion on which programming language to use specificlly, we can easily convert them back. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 10:38, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

I think I've come up with a reasonable solution to this problem.  Instead of choosing any one language why not use pseudocode in the body of the text, thus providing this information in a more general context in order to demonstrate how an algorithm might be written.  Then near the end of the article, or after major examples a link can be given to a page where various code snippets from a variety of languages can be submitted for users to get a more specific example of a concept in the language they are comfortable with.  This seems like it would solve any disputes and create a book that is not bounded by the constraints of teaching in any one language.  Tell me what you all think. --[[User:Etscrivner|Etscrivner]] 8:25, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

==The Programming Language==

If this is for High School Students, either an appropriate first programming language should be used or we should follow the AP Computer Science Standards.  http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap08_compsci_coursedesc.pdf

AP Computer Science exam uses Java as their Language.  That should a fine first language, but if others think that something easier should be used, than I would recommend using PHP.  Or better yet, why not use PHP is relation to MediaWiki.  Maybe this chapter's scope should be limited to how to setup a MediaWiki using PHP, MySQL, and Apache.  For a project, pick a simple extension, it could even be one that is already written or just make one up that would be fun for a student to use.  It is much easier to add onto an existing code base than to write something completely from scratch.  The kids can be exposed to all of the basic programming structures, but actually accoplish something tangable at the same time.

I am a Software Engineer, and C is definitely NOT a first programming language.  There is no safety in C, and it is very easy to get yourself into trouble really fast.  Between PHP and Java, I personally feel that PHP is easier to learn, especially when it is the foundation language for many shareware products: MediaWiki, Moodle, WordPress, etc.  So my final vote for a chapter in a high school math book, as opposed to a whole textbook is PHP. [[User:Zzmonty|Zzmonty]] ([[User talk:Zzmonty|talk]]) 05:15, 1 February 2009 (UTC)


===The Case for Python===

OK, here's my 2 cents worth on this issue. We should pick a language which allows students to focus on the algorithms without getting too involved in the nuts and bolts of software engineering.

C: is great for teaching people how computers actually work but is a bit too &quot;close to the machine&quot; to be ideal for teaching people how to use computer programs to explore mathematics. Students are likely to spend too much time on pointers, memory management and compilation/linking problems. Also the need to have separate header and source files is a distraction.

Java: is great for teaching OO programming but the fact that it is so Object Oriented means that students will have to spend too long getting to grips with Objects, Classes, Inheritence, Polymorphism etc. and not enough time thinking about the algorithms.

Lisp/Prolog etc: again are great for teaching predicate calculus but are difficult to use for purely functional programming.

Python: has a simple and consise syntax and scripts can be run directly without the need for the compilation stage. There is no need to consider pointers, type conversions, memory management etc. Likewise there is no need to be distracted by OO concepts but OO concepts can be introduced if needed. Also the interactive python shell can be used directly as a sort of massively powerful and expressive calculator. Also Python has the NumPy and SciPy modules that enable you to easily do graphs, statistics, linear algebra and much much more! Also it is free (as in beer) and Open Source....for what its worth my vote goes for Python.([[User:Russell|Russell]] ([[User talk:Russell|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Russell|contribs]]) 10:06, 19 July 2011 (UTC))

Would &quot;Dziękuję&quot; be better translated as &quot;thank ''you''&quot; (instead of the quite informal &quot;thanks&quot;) to signify its (relative) formality? --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] 04:27, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Generally &quot;Dziękuje&quot; means &quot;thanks&quot;. When you are about to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, you have to say &quot;Dziękuje Ci&quot;
No!!! I'm from Poland. &quot;Dziękuję&quot; means &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Dzięki&quot; means &quot;Thanks&quot;.

== Pronunciation ==
I have already added pronunciations of the words/sentences. If you need more of them, please let me know at [[commons:user talk:odder|my commons]] or [[:pl:w:user talk:odder|polish Wikipedia talk page]]. Best regards, [[:pl:w:user:odder]]/[[commons:user:odder]] 14:28, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

yo soy

&quot;no&quot; is ordinary word. Mustn't use its in official texts.

== Translation ==
Dear all,
I think using &quot;Jak leci?&quot; might be unfortunate. Possibly it would be better to use &quot;Co tam?&quot;. It is more natural.
Jak leci? - what's up? (lit. how's it flying?) (Yah-k l-eh-chee) About this sound pronunciation (help·info)
Co tam? - what's up? (lit. what there?) (Tso tham)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Thunderbunny. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Thunderbunny~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

::Please please please stop with the images. Use TeX it is so much better. Every image you upload that contains a formula is going to have to be deleted and converted to TeX :-(   [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:23, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)

The use of images instead of TeX '''''prevents other users from editing the formulae'''''. Kindly do ''not'' revert the changes that I have made - if you do not want to learn TeX and create TeX formulae, then do not revert the changes that others are making to our work.

==[[Die Mechanik flüssiger und gasförmiger Körper]]==

Diese Seite haben wir eigentlich mit Absicht nicht auf die Leitseite genommen, da wir uns in der Diskussion über die Leitseite darauf verständigt haben, dass dort nur Artikel stehen sollen, die (fast) fertig sind. Zumindest die alte Leitseite behauptete, das Buch sei nur zu 50% fertig. Da ich nicht beurteilen kann, ob das Buch jetzt tatsächlich inzwischen fertig ist, oder nicht möchte ich dich bitten, im [[Regal Physik]] die entsprechende Angabe auf 100% zu ändern, oder das Buch vorerst mal wieder von der Leitseite zu entfernen. (Ich bin nicht böse und das soll auch kein Tadel sein; schließlich müssen wir uns an die neue Leitseite erst mal alle gewöhnen).

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Siegfried Petry. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Siegfried Petry~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

Adding -い(-i) to the end of these colors will make them adjectives, allowing them to be placed before a noun: 赤い red (adj.), 青い blue (adj.), 黄色い yellow (adj.), 茶色い brown (adj.), 白い white (adj.), 黒い black (adj.).

==Function as Box==

Functions are another way of describing certain things mathematically.  They are often described as a machine in a box open on two ends; you put something in one end, something happens to it in the middle, and something pops out the other end.  The function is the machine inside, and it's defined by what it does to whatever you give it.

Let's say the machine has a blade that slices whatever you put into it in two and sends one half out the other end.  If you put in a banana, you'd get back half a banana.  If you put in an apple, you'd get back half an apple.

[[Image:Apple_slicing_function.png]] 

A good question to ask about this machine might be what happened to the other half of the piece of fruit?  But, since this is algebra the things that go in and come out of functions will be numbers, so we're pretty sure the box won't fill up with numbers and break.  Let's define the function to take what you give it and cut it in half, that is, divide it by two.  If you put in 2, you'd get back 1.  If you put in 57, you'd get back 28.5. The function machine allows us to alter expressions. Functions are typically named with a single letter.  We'll call this one ''h'' for ''half''.  (There's nothing special about the letter we choose--we could just as well called this function ''f''.  The letter doesn't have to stand for anything.)

Now we need the notation.  To put 2 into the function, we write &lt;math&gt; h(2) &lt;/math&gt; (read ''h of 2'').  We know that

&lt;math&gt; h(2) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

We can also calculate 

&lt;math&gt; h(57) = 28.5 &lt;/math&gt;

Using algebraic notation we can describe what this machine does as:

&lt;math&gt; h(x) = \frac{x}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Instead of listing all the things we can put in our machine we represent them with a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  When we write &lt;math&gt; h(x) &lt;/math&gt; we are saying that we sent &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; through the machine and it was cut in half.  Using this form we don't have to count the halves that come out of our machine when we put 57 apples or oranges in our machine.  We know that we put 57 or anything into our machine we will only have 28.5 of those things come out the other end. When using algebraic notation to specify a relationship; we have created something called an algebraic function definition. (This example illustrates the difference between mathematics and science and engineering. Since this is an imaginary machine we only need to specify what comes out the other end of the box.  In real machines we also need to think about what to do with the halves that don't come out the other end).

== Practice Problems ==

For problems 1-6, Use algebra to define the function described.

 Example: x) Three-quarters of a number
  Answer: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3x/4&lt;/math&gt;

1. Four-fifths of a number

2. A number added to itself five times

3. A number increased by three times the number

4. A number multiplied by itself seven times, then reduced by the number

5. One number reduced by a different number three times

6. Half a number times three more than another number

Passing a number through the function box is called evaluating the function for a number.  For problems 7-9, evaluate the described function for the given numbers.

 Example: x) &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 3x-4&lt;/math&gt;
  a) &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt; b) &lt;math&gt;f(4)&lt;/math&gt;
  c) &lt;math&gt;f(1/3)&lt;/math&gt;   d) &lt;math&gt;f(1/2)&lt;/math&gt;
  
  Answer: a) &lt;math&gt;f(0) = 3(0)-4 = -4&lt;/math&gt;     b) &lt;math&gt;f(4) = 3(4)-4 = 8&lt;/math&gt;
  c) &lt;math&gt;f(1/3) = 3(1/3)-4 = -3&lt;/math&gt; d) &lt;math&gt;f(1/2) = 3(1/2)-4 = -5/2&lt;/math&gt;

7. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 10x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
:a) &lt;math&gt; f(1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  b) &lt;math&gt; f(1/2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:c) &lt;math&gt; f(3.5) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; d) &lt;math&gt; f(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

8. &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 3x - 1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
:a) &lt;math&gt; g(4) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; b) &lt;math&gt; g(2/3)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:c) &lt;math&gt; g(1.1) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; d) &lt;math&gt; g(-3)&lt;/math&gt;

9. &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
:a) &lt;math&gt; h(7) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; b) &lt;math&gt; h(3/5)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:c) &lt;math&gt; h(5.3) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt; d) &lt;math&gt; h(-6)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- ''Varying letters should be used for functions in these problems (mainly f,g,h, maybe others) to demonstrate.'' --&gt;

==Function as Relation==

Functions can also be thought of as a subset of '''relations'''.  A relation is a connection between numbers in one set and numbers in another.

[[Image:Mapping_that's_not_a_function.png]] 

In other words, each number you put in is associated with each number you get out.  The difference is that ''in a function, every 'input' number is associated with exactly one 'output' number'' whereas in a relation an 'input' number may be associated with multiple or no 'output' numbers. This is an important fact about functions. 
Notice that the relation depicted by the diagram above is '''not''' a function because it does '''not''' meet this requirement, unlike the relation depicted by the second diagram below, which is a function.

[[Image:Allowed mapping for a function.png]] 

All functions are relations. Not all relations are functions.

== Practice Problems ==

1. Which of the following definitions are functions and which are relations:
:a. &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
:b. &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x - 2&lt;/math&gt;
:c. &lt;math&gt;h(x) = x * 2&lt;/math&gt;
:d. &lt;math&gt;i(x) = x / 2&lt;/math&gt;

2. Which of the following definitions are functions and which are relations:
:a. &lt;math&gt;j(x) = x + x&lt;/math&gt;
:b. &lt;math&gt;k(x) = x - x&lt;/math&gt;
:c. &lt;math&gt;l(x) = x * x&lt;/math&gt;
:d. &lt;math&gt;m(x) = x / x&lt;/math&gt;

3. Can you write descriptions of the functions in problems 1 and 2?  What is the difference?


[[Algebra/Functions/Answers1|Answers]]

==Domain and Range==
===Domain===
The ''domain'' of a function is the set of 'input' numbers for which the function is defined.  The domain is part of the definition of a function.  In the function in the illustration above, the domain is {-1,1,7,1/2}.

The ''natural domain'' of an algebraically-defined function is the set of numbers for which the function is defined.

In most algebra formulas, ''x'' is usually the variable associated with Domain.

''Example''

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt; has a domain of &lt;math&gt;x\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; because the square root function is only defined for positive numbers (assuming that we are dealing with only real numbers).

===Range===

The ''range'' of a function is the set of results or solutions to the equation for a given input.  A true function only has one result for every Domain.

In most algebra formulas, ''y'' is usually the variable associated with Range.  As such, it can also be expressed ''f''(''x''), which says that its value is a function of ''x''.

''Example''

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; has a range of &lt;math&gt;y\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; because the square of a number is always positive.

===Functions in terms of Domain and Range===

In taking both domain and range into account, a function is any mathematical formula that produces one and only one result for each input.  Hence, it can be said that in a valid function, Domain (x) and Range (y) have a many to one correspondence so that every given Domain value has one and only one Range value as a result, but not necessarily vice versa.  This makes sense since results can repeat, but inputs cannot.

As a result, if x is horizontal and y is vertical, a function in terms of y (e.g. [[Algebra/Function Graphing|y = mx + b]]) will produce a set of results such that if intersected by a vertical line at any point on the [[Algebra/Function Graphing|graph]] it will only pass through the graph once.  An asymptotic function (one with at least one undefined result) would also count as valid since it did not pass through more than one point of the graph.  This is called the &quot;vertical line&quot; test.

''The terms domain and range can be applied to all relations and not just functions. A relation is a definition where one item in the definition's domain maps to more than one item in the definition's range. We use the terms domain and range to define the difference between a function and a relation.''

==A Bit of Function Terminology==
When speaking or writing about functions, different terminologies are used to describe how the functions work or what they do.
===f of x Terminology===
When we write &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we say ''f of x''.  Thus, if we have a function defined with the equation
&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\frac{x+2}{7}&lt;/math&gt; then we say that 

&lt;center&gt;''g of x equals the sum of x and 2 altogether divided by 7.''
or
''g of x is x plus 2 all over 7.''&lt;/center&gt;


When we plug a value (say 5) into the function for x we write &lt;math&gt;g(5)=\frac{5+2}{7}=\frac{7}{7}=1&lt;/math&gt; but we say that 

&lt;center&gt;''g of 5 equals 1''.&lt;/center&gt;

Algebraic notation is the easiest way mathematicians have to express relationships defined by arithmetic operators like &lt;math&gt;+, -. / *,&lt;/math&gt; exponents, and roots. Once some of these functions have been defined it is easier to refer to the function name, and to refer to the values of the function as above.

===Function &quot;value of&quot;  Terminology===
If we have a function defined with the equation
&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\frac{x+2}{7}&lt;/math&gt; then we say that ''The value of g at x is the sum of x and 2 altogether divided by 7.
This way, &lt;math&gt;g(5)=\frac{5+2}{7}=\frac{7}{7}=1&lt;/math&gt;

==[[:w:Piecewise|Piecewise-defined]] function==
&lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 4x^2 -3x +6&lt;/math&gt;, find &lt;math&gt;f(-2)&lt;/math&gt; --&gt; &lt;!-- WTF is this? --&gt;
A function whose definition depends on the input.

===Absolute value function===
f(x)=|x|&lt;br/&gt;
''or''&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} x &amp; \mbox{if } x\ge 0 \\ -x &amp; \mbox{if } x&lt;0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;


One can interpret &lt;math&gt; |x|&lt;/math&gt; as the undirected distance between x and 0, (which is always non-negative). Going on, &lt;math&gt; |x-y|&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the distance between the numbers x and y on the number line.

==Even and odd functions==
===Even functions===
An even function is defined as a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(-x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Geometrically an even function can be defined as a function that exhibits a mirror image symmetry across the y-axis (the vertical line that passes through the origin).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
An example of an even function is &lt;math&gt;h(x)=x^{2}&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;f(5)=25=f(-5)&lt;/math&gt; and because
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^{2}=f(-x)&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' real numbers ''x''.

===Odd functions===
An odd function is defined as a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(-x)=-f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Geometrically an odd function can be defined as a function that exhibits a 180 degree rotational symmetry about the origin.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
An example of an ''odd'' function is &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^{3}&lt;/math&gt; because for all real numbers ''x'', 
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^{3}=-((-x)^{3})=-f(-x)&lt;/math&gt; for example &lt;math&gt;f(2)=2^{3}=8=-((-2)^{3})=-(-8)=-((-2)^{3})=-f(-2)&lt;/math&gt;

==Composite function==
A composite function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the composite of the two functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and denoted as &lt;math&gt;h(x)=f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; (read h of x ''is equal to'' f of g of x) or &lt;math&gt;h(x)=(f\circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Composite Function Box.PNG]]

Example:
 Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x+1&lt;/math&gt;     &lt;math&gt;g(x)=5x-3&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;math&gt;h(x)=f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;math&gt;h(x)=f(5x-3)&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;math&gt;h(x)=2(5x-3)+1&lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;math&gt;h(x)=10x-6+1&lt;/math&gt;
 &amp;there4;&lt;math&gt;h(x)=10x-5&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

 Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=-\sqrt{16-x} \,&lt;/math&gt;     &lt;math&gt;g(x)=4x^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)=f(4x^2) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)=-\sqrt{16-(4x^2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)=-\sqrt{4(4-x^2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)=-\sqrt{4}\sqrt{(4-x^2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)(x)=-2\sqrt{4-x^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
 Domain: &lt;math&gt;-2\le x\le 2&lt;/math&gt;
 Range: &lt;math&gt;-4\le y\le 0&lt;/math&gt;

==Inverse function==
The function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of the one-to-one function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the following are true:&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(f(x))=x \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(x))=x \,&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; .

Geometrically &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the reflection of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; across the line &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;.
Conceptually, using the &lt;i&gt;box&lt;/i&gt; analogy, a function's inverse box &lt;i&gt;undoes&lt;/i&gt; what the function's
regular box does.  

[[Image:Fruit function and inverse.PNG]]
Example:
 &lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{2}x \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(x))=f(\frac{1}{2}x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(x))=2(\frac{1}{2}x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;f(f^{-1}(x))=x \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
 
 &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(x))=f^{-1}(2x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(x))=\frac{1}{2}(2x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(x))=x \,&lt;/math&gt;

To find the inverse of a function, remember that when we use &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; as an input to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; the result is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  So start by writing &lt;math&gt;x = f\left( f^{-1}(x) \right)&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Example:
 Suppose:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x+1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
 Then &lt;math&gt;x = f\left( f^{-1}(x) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;x=2f^{-1}(x)+1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;x-1=2f^{-1}(x) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x-1}{2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The Domain of an inverse function is exactly the same as the Range of the original function.  If the Range of the original function is limited in some way,  the inverse of a function will require a restricted domain.

Example:
 &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sqrt{x - 1} \,&lt;/math&gt;         
 &lt;math&gt;x = f\left(f^{-1}(x)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;x=\sqrt{f^{-1}(x) - 1} \,&lt;/math&gt;         
 &lt;math&gt;x^2=\sqrt{f^{-1}(x) - 1}^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;         
 &lt;math&gt;x^2=f^{-1}(x) - 1 &lt;/math&gt;            
 &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)=x^2 + 1\,&lt;/math&gt;            
 The Range of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge0&lt;/math&gt;. So the Domain of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.
===One-to-one function===
A function that for every input there exists an output unique to that input.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Equivalently, we may say that a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called ''one-to-one'' if for all
&lt;math&gt;x,x'\in A, f(x)=f(x')&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x=x'&lt;/math&gt; where ''A'' is the domain set of ''f'' and
both ''x'' and ''x''' are members of that set.

'''Horizontal Line Test'''&lt;br/&gt;
If no horizontal line intersects the graph of a function in more than one place then the function is a one-to-one function.
== Creating Functions ==

In the previous chapter we reviewed what you've already learned about mathematics: Numbers, Variables, and Relationships.  We reviewed the types of numbers,  the operations you can perform on numbers, the properties of these operations, and how these properties can allow you to write expressions, or if we know about enough the constraints on the expressions you can write equations and inequalities that define things that are true.

In the section above we've looked at the concept of a function. First we showed how to created equations with a function on one side of the equals operator and an expression on the other.  Then we looked at more complicated ways to use function notation.  

Once you get used to them functions give you a different way to look at math.  When you think about math with numbers you are thinking about just one answer.  When you think about math with functions you are looking for relationships and you are building mathematical models. 

Give an example of a 3 X 3 square with a diagonal.  What is the area of one of the triangles from the diagonal.  Apply the Area function: l X w, and then the half function.</text>

''Note: I think the topic of functions deserves a bit of introduction, though I'm not sure if this is the right module for it.  [[Calculus/Functions]] covers similar ground, but this explanation is intended as less 'technical' and more level-appropriate.  Perhaps it's the wrong tone to take in this book, though.

==Moving introductory section of &quot;Function graphing&quot; module here==

I am thinking of perhaps moving the introductory section of the next module [[Algebra/Function Graphing]] to this module, [[Algebra/Functions]], and renaming this module [[Algebra/Functions and graphing]] and the next module would be renamed [[Algebra/Linear function graphing]].  This is because the existing [[Algebra/Function Graphing]] module has become fairly long, it only covers linear function graphing, and problems have not been added yet.  Any thoughts on this matter?  &lt;br&gt;[[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 14:00, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

== Particle Properties ==

Before learning about subatomic particles, some basic properties should be understood.

=== Charge ===

Particles may be electrically charged.  '''Charge''' is a property which defines the force that a particle will exert on other charged particles.  There is a well known saying that applies perfectly: &quot;Opposites attract.&quot;  (Likewise, like charges repel.)  Positive charges and negative charges will attract each other and come together.  Two positive or two negative charges will push each other away.

{{Helpful hint|hint=Not all particles have charge.}}
The amount of charge a particle has is measured in [[w:Coulomb|coulombs]], but it is more conveniently expressed in terms of an integer.  For instance, a helium ion that has 2 less electrons than usual has a charge of +2, and a bromide ion with one more electron than usual has a charge of -1.  (This may seem backwards, but remember that an electron has a negative charge.)  Notice that charge not only applies to subatomic particles, but also ions and other things as well.  Always remember to specify if a charge is positive or negative.  Unlike ordinary numbers, we ''always write the plus sign for positive charges'' to avoid confusion with a negative charge.

{{Info|1=
It may be useful to understand '''Coulomb's Law'''.  It explains the electromagnetic force: &lt;math&gt; F = \frac{k Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge on each particle, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between them, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.  So, if the distance between two particles is doubled, the force will be reduced four times.  Double the charge would mean double the force, be it attractive or repulsive.  Coulomb's Law will be especially important when understanding periodic trends.

However, there is no need to solve it exactly.  Just remember the relationships between the variables.}}

=== Mass ===

Mass is the measure of inertia.  From a subatomic point of view, mass can also be understood in terms of energy, but that does not concern us when dealing with chemistry.  Mass for particles, atoms, and molecules is not measured in grams, as with ordinary substances.  Instead, it is measured in ''atomic mass units'', or '''amu'''.  For more information about mass and amu, read the previous chapters on properties of matter.

== The Nucleus ==

[[Image:Simple atom (lithium).png|thumb|An atom (not to scale!)]]

At the center of each atom lies the nucleus. It is incredibly small: if you were to take the average atom (itself miniscule in size) and expand it to the size of a football stadium, then the nucleus would be about the size of a marble. It is, however, astoundingly dense: despite the tiny percentage of the atom's volume it contains nearly all of the atom's mass. The nucleus almost never changes under normal conditions, remaining constant throughout chemical reactions. Nuclei are themselves made up of a pair of smaller and more dense particles, the '''proton''' and the '''neutron'''. These particles are collectively dubbed '''nucleons'''.

=== Protons ===

Protons have a charge of +1 and a mass of 1 amu.  They are often represented by a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

Protons will be important when learning about acids and bases—they are the essence of acid.  Remember that the number of protons in an atom is its ''atomic number'', and defines what element it will be.  The number of protons in a nucleus ranges from '''one''' to over a hundred.

Consider the element hydrogen.  Its atomic number is 1, so it has one proton and one electron.  If it is made into an ion (an atom with missing or extra electrons), it will simply be a lone proton.  Thus, a proton ''is'' the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, and a proton ''is'' a hydrogen ion.  Therefore, a proton can be written as &lt;math&gt;\text{H}^+&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;_1^1\text{H}^+&lt;/math&gt;, both symbols for a hydrogen ion.

=== Neutrons ===

Neutrons have no charge and a mass of 1 amu.  A neutron is slightly heavier than a proton, but the difference is insignificant.  Neutrons are often written &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.
{{SideBox|Our friends the physicists say that neutrons and protons are made of even smaller particles called ''quarks''.  Fortunately, we don't need to know about that because quarks do not affect chemistry.  Instead, quarks fall in the field of [[Quantum Mechanics]].}} &lt;!-- &quot;Fortunately&quot; is in bad taste --&gt;

Unlike the protons, neutrons cannot exist outside the nucleus indefinitely as they become unstable and break down. Within one nucleus there can be many protons and neutrons all in close proximity to one another. The number of neutrons in a nucleus ranges from '''zero''' to over a hundred.

You may wonder why neutrons exist.  They have no charge, so can they do anything?  The answer is yes—neutrons are very important.  Remember that opposites attract and likes repel.  If so, then how can several protons stay clumped together in the dense nucleus of an atom?  It would seem as if the protons would repel and scatter the nucleus.  However, there is a '''strong nuclear force''' that holds the nucleus together.  This incredible force causes nucleons to attract each other with much greater strength than the electric force can repel them, but only over extremely short distances.

A delicate balance exists between the number of protons and neutrons. Protons, which are attracted to one another via the strong force but simultaneously repelled by their electromagnetic charges, cannot exist in great numbers within the nucleus without the stabilizing action of neutrons, which are attracted via the strong force but are not charged. Conversely, neutrons lend their inherent instability to the nucleus and too many will destabilize it.

{{Info|Neutrons are the reason for '''isotopes''', or atoms with the same number of protons but different masses.  The masses are different because of different numbers of neutrons.  Isotopes of a given element have almost identical chemical properties (like color, melting point, reactions, etc.), but they have different nuclear properties.  Some isotopes are stable, others are radioactive.  Different isotopes decay in different ways.}}

Lastly, neutrons are very important in nuclear reactions, such as those used in power plants.  Neutrons act like a bullet that can split an atom's nucleus.  Because they have no charge, neutrons are neither attracted nor repelled by atoms and ions.

== The Electron Cloud ==

Surrounding the dense nucleus is a cloud of electrons.  Electrons have a charge of -1 and a mass of 0 amu.  That does not mean they are massless.  Electrons do have mass, but it is so small that it has no effect on the overall mass of an atom.  An electron has approximately 1/1800 the mass of a proton or neutron.  Electrons are written &lt;math&gt;e^-&lt;/math&gt;.

Electrons orbit the outside of a nucleus, unaffected by the strong nuclear force.  They define the chemical properties of an atom because virtually every chemical reaction deals with the interaction or exchange of the outer electrons of atoms and molecules.

Electrons are attracted to the nucleus of an atom because they are negative and the nucleus (being made of protons and neutrons) is positive.  Opposites attract.  However, electrons don't fall into the nucleus.  They orbit around it at specific distances because the electrons have a certain amount of energy.  That energy prevents them from getting too close, as they must maintain a specific speed and distance.  Changes in the energy levels of electrons cause different phenomena such as spectral lines, the color of substances, and the creation of ions (atoms with missing or extra electrons).

=== Electron Interactions ===

''Atoms will always have equal numbers of protons and electrons'', so their overall charge is zero.  Atoms are neutral.  Ions, on the other hand, are atoms that have gained or lost electrons and now have an unequal number of protons and electrons.  If there are extra electrons, the ion will be negatively charged.  If there are missing electrons, the ion will be positively charged, due to the majority of positive protons.

'''Valence electrons''' (the outermost electrons) are responsible for an atom's behavior in chemical bonds.  The ''core electrons'' are all of the electrons not in the outermost shell, and they rarely get involved.  An atom will attempt to fill its valence shell.  This occurs when an atom has eight valence electrons (as explained in the next chapter), so atoms will undergo chemical bonds to either share, give, or take the electrons it needs.  Sodium, for example, is very likely to give up its one valence electron, so that its outer shell is empty (the shell underneath it is full).  Chlorine is very likely to take an electron because it has seven and wants eight.  When sodium and chlorine are mixed, they exchange electrons and create sodium chloride (table salt).  As a result, both elements have full valence shells, and a very stable compound is formed.

==Electron shells==
Each '''shell''' is subdivided into '''subshells''', which are made up of '''orbitals''',  each of which has electrons with different angular momentum. Each orbital in a shell has a characteristic shape, and is named by a letter. They are: '''s''', '''p''', '''d''', and '''f'''. In a one-electron atom (e.g. H, He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.) the energy of each orbital within a particular shell is identical. However, when there are multiple electrons, they interact and split the orbitals into slightly different energies. Within any particular shell, the energy of the orbitals depend on the angular momentum of orbitals s, p, d, and f in order of lowest to highest energy. No two orbitals have the same energy level.

This image shows the orbitals (along with hybrid orbitals for bonding and a sample electron configuration, explained later).
[[Image:Electron orbitals.svg|600px]]

==The s orbital==
The simplest orbital in the atom is the 1s orbital. It has no radial or angular '''nodes''': the 1s orbital is simply a sphere of electron density. A node is a point where the electron probability is zero.  As with all orbitals the number of radial nodes increases with the principle quantum number (i.e. the 2s orbital has one radial node, the 3s has two etc.). Because the angular momentum quantum number is 0, there is only one choice for the magnetic quantum number - there is only one s orbital per shell. The s orbital can hold two electrons, as long as they have different spin quantum numbers.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
n &amp;=&amp; 1, 2, 3, ... \\
l &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
m_l &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
m_s &amp;=&amp; +\frac{1}{2},  -\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==The p orbitals==

Starting from the 2nd shell, there is a set of p orbitals. The angular momentum quantum number of the electrons confined to p orbitals is 1, so each orbital has one '''angular node'''. There are 3 choices for the magnetic quantum number, which indicates 3 differently oriented p orbitals. Finally, each orbital can accommodate two electrons (with opposite spins), giving the p orbitals a total capacity of 6 electrons.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
n &amp;=&amp; 2, 3, 4, ... \\
l &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
m_l &amp;=&amp; -1,0,1 \\
m_s &amp;=&amp; +\frac{1}{2},  -\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The p orbitals all have two lobes of electron density pointing along each of the axes. Each one is symmetrical along its axis. The notation for the p orbitals indicate which axis it points down, i.e. p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; points along the x axis, p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; on the y axis and p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; up and down the z axis. The p orbitals are '''degenerate''' — they all have the same energy. P orbitals are very often involved in '''bonding'''.

|-

| [[Image:P2M0.png|100px]]
| [[Image:P2M-1.png|100px]]
|}

==The d orbitals==

The first set of d orbitals is the 3d set. The angular momentum quantum number is 2, so each orbital has two '''angular nodes'''. There are 5 choices for the magnetic quantum number, which gives rise to 5 different d orbitals. Each orbital can hold two electrons (with opposite spins), giving the d orbitals a total capacity of 10 electrons.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
n &amp;=&amp; 3, 4, 5, ... \\
l &amp;=&amp; 2 \\
m_l &amp;=&amp; -2,-1,0,1,2 \\
m_s &amp;=&amp; +\frac{1}{2},  -\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that all the d orbitals have four lobes of electron density, except for the d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital, which has two opposing lobes and a doughnut of electron density around the middle. The d orbitals can be further subdivided into two smaller sets. The d&lt;sub&gt;x2-y2&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; all point directly along the x, y, and z axes. They form an '''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''' set. On the other hand, the lobes of the d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt; all line up in the quadrants, with no electron density on the axes. These three orbitals form the '''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;''' set. In most cases, the d orbitals are '''degenerate''', but sometimes they can split, with the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; subsets having different energy. '''Crystal Field Theory''' predicts and accounts for this. D orbitals are sometimes involved in bonding, especially in inorganic chemistry.

| [[Image:D3M-2.png|100px]]
|}

== The f orbitals ==
The first set of f orbitals is the 4f subshell.  There are 7 possible magnetic quantum numbers, so there are 7 f orbitals.  Their shapes are fairly complicated, and they rarely come up when studying chemistry.  There are 14 f electrons because each orbital can hold two electrons (with opposite spins).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
n &amp;=&amp; 4, 5, 6, ... \\
l &amp;=&amp; 3 \\
m_l &amp;=&amp; -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 \\

== Filling Electron Shells ==
When an atom or ion receives electrons into its orbitals, the orbitals and shells fill up in a particular manner.

=== Aufbau principle ===

You may consider an atom as being &quot;built up&quot; from a naked nucleus by gradually adding to it one electron after another, until all the electrons it will hold have been added. Much as one fills up a container with liquid from the bottom up, the orbitals of an atom are filled from the lowest energy orbitals to the highest energy orbitals.

Orbitals with the lowest principal quantum number (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) have the lowest energy and will fill up first.  Within a shell, there may be several orbitals with the same principal quantum number.  In that case, more specific rules must be applied.  For example, the three p orbitals of a given shell all occur at the same energy level.  So, how are they filled up?
ans: all the three p orbitals have same energy so while filling the p orbitals we can fill any one of the Px, Py or Pz first. it is a convention that we chose to fill Px first ,then Py and then Pz for our simplicity. Hence you can opt for filling these three orbitals from right to left also.

=== Hund's Rule ===

According to Hund's rule, orbitals of the same energy are each filled with one electron before filling any with a second. Also, these first electrons have the same spin.

This rule is sometimes called the &quot;bus seating rule&quot;.  As people load onto a bus, each person takes his own seat, sitting alone.  Only after all the seats have been filled will people start doubling up.

=== Pauli Exclusion principle ===

No two electrons can have all four quantum numbers the same. What this translates to in terms of our picture of orbitals is that each orbital can only hold two electrons, one &quot;spin up&quot; (+½) and one &quot;spin down&quot; (-½).

[[Image:FillingElectronDiagram.gif|frame|This animation demonstrates the Aufbau principle, Hund's Rule, and the Pauli Exclusion principle.]]

=== Orbital Order ===
1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s.

Although this looks confusing, there is an easy way to remember.

[[Image:Electron configuration order.gif]]

Understanding the above rules and diagrams will allow you to determine the electron configuration of almost any atom or ion.

== How to Write the Electron Configuration of an Isolated Atom ==

{{Wikipedia|Electron configuration}}
Electron-configuration notation is relatively straightforward. An isolated Calcium atom &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, for example, would have configuration of 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in its ''ground state''. Other configurations like
1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;4p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; are possible, but these ''excited states'' have a higher energy. They are not stable and generally only exist for a brief moment.

The ground state configuration for Ca could be abbreviated by using the preceding ''noble gas'' (the elements found all the way on the right of the periodic table) as [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where Ar is argon.  

Noble gases have very stable configurations, and are extremely reluctant to lose or gain electrons. Noble gas atoms are also the only ones regularly found as isolated atoms in the ground state. Atoms of other elements all undergo bonding under the conditions that we live under and this affects the orbitals that the outermost electrons are in. In that sense the electron configurations for the other elements are somewhat hypothetical: to encounter an isolated atom of, say, tungsten (W), we would have to first vaporize a metal that boils at 5800K. However, knowing atomic configurations is useful because it does help us to understand how and why they bond, i.e. why and how they change the configuration of their outer ''valence'' electrons.

== Rule of Stability ==
A subshell is particularly stable if it is half full or full. Given two configurations, the atom would &quot;choose&quot; the more stable one. 

Example: In the following configuration, Cu: [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, copper's d shell is just one away from stability, and therefore, one electron from the s shell jumps into the d shell: [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. This way, the d shell is full, and is therefore stable, and the s shell is half full, and is also stable.

[[Image:CopperElectronDiagram.gif]]

Another example: Chromium has a configuration of [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, although you would expect to see four d electrons instead of five.  This is because an s electron has jumped into the d orbital, giving the atom two half-full shells—much more stable than a d orbital with only four electrons.

The stability rule applies to atoms in the same group as chromium and copper. 

If one of these atoms has been ionized, that is, it loses an electron, it will come from the s orbital rather than the d orbital.  For instance, the configuration of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; is [Ar]4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.  If more electrons are removed, they will come from the d orbital.

== Magnetism ==
[[Image:MagnetismElectronDiagram.gif|frame|The spin of an electron creates a magnetic field (albeit ridiculously weak), so unpaired electrons create a small magnetic field.  Paired electrons have opposite spin, so the magnetic fields cancel each other out, leading to diamagnetism.]]

Magnetism is a well-known effect.  Chances are, you have magnets on your refrigerator.  As you already know, only certain elements are magnetic.  Electron configurations help to explain why.

'''Diamagnetism''' is actually a very weak repulsion to magnetic fields.  All elements have diamagnetism to some degree.  It occurs when there are paired electrons.

'''Paramagnetism''' is an attraction to external magnetic fields.  It is also very weak.  It occurs whenever there is an unpaired electron in an orbital.

Both diamagnetism and paramagnetism are responses of spins acting ''independently'' from each other. This leads to rather weak repulsion and attraction respectively. However, when they are located in a solid they may also interact with each other and respond ''collectively'' and that can lead to rather different properties:

'''Ferromagnetism''' is the permanent magnetism that we encounter in our daily lives. It occurs when all the unpaired spins in a solid couple and tend to align themselves in the same direction, leading to a strong attraction when exposed to a magnetic field.  This only occurs at room temperature with three elements: iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co). Gadolinium (Gd) is a borderline case. It loses its ferromagnetism at 20&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C; above that temperature the spins start to act alone. However, there are many alloys and compounds that exhibit strong ferromagnetic coupling. The strongest one is Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B

'''Antiferromagnetism''' is also a permanent magnetism in which unpaired spins align, but they do so in opposite directions. The result that the material does not react very strongly to a magnetic field at all. Chromium (Cr) is an example.

''''Ferrimagnetism''' is a combination of ferro- and antiferromagetism. Unpaired spins align partly in opposite directions, but the compensation is not complete. This is why the material is still attracted strongly to a magnetic field. Magnetite Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is such a substance. It was the first material studied for its magnetic properties and may well be the one sitting on your fridge.

The '''octet rule''' refers to the tendency of atoms to prefer to have eight electrons in the ''valence shell''. When atoms have fewer than eight electrons, they tend to react and form more stable compounds.  When discussing the octet rule, we do not consider d or f electrons.  Only the s and p electrons are involved in the octet rule, making it useful for the ''representative elements'' (elements not in the transition metal or inner-transition metal blocks).  An octet corresponds to an electron configuration ending with s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Stability ==

Atoms will react to get in the most stable state possible.  A complete octet is very stable because all orbitals will be full.  Atoms with greater stability have less energy, so a reaction that increases the stability of the atoms will release energy in the form of heat or light.  Reactions that decrease stability must absorb energy, getting colder.

The other tendency of atoms is to maintain a neutral charge. Only the [[General Chemistry/Chemistries of Various Elements/Group 18|noble gases]] (the elements on the right-most column of the [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table]]) have zero charge with filled valence octets. All of the other elements have a charge when they have eight electrons all to themselves. The result of these two guiding principles is the explanation for much of the reactivity and bonding that is observed within atoms: '''atoms seek to share electrons in a way that minimizes charge while fulfilling an octet in the valence shell'''.

{{Info|The noble gases rarely form compounds.  They have the most stable configuration (full octet, no charge), so they have no reason to react and change their configuration.  All other elements attempt to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration.}}

=== Example ===

The formula for table salt is NaCl.  It is the result of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions bonding together.  If sodium metal and chlorine gas mix under the right conditions, they will form salt.  The sodium loses an electron, and the chlorine gains that electron.  In the process, a great amount of light and heat is released.  The resulting salt is mostly unreactive — it is stable.  It won't undergo any explosive reactions, unlike the sodium and chlorine that it is made of.

Why?  Referring to the octet rule, atoms attempt to get a noble gas electron configuration, which is eight valence electrons.  Sodium has one valence electron, so giving it up would result in the same electron configuration as neon.  Chlorine has seven valence electrons, so if it takes one it will have eight (an octet).  Chlorine has the electron configuration of argon when it gains an electron.

The octet rule could have been satisfied if chlorine gave up all seven of its valence electrons and sodium took them.  In that case, both would have the electron configurations of noble gasses, with a full valence shell.  However, their charges would be much higher.  It would be Na&lt;sup&gt;7-&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much less stable than Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.  Atoms are more stable when they have no charge, or a small charge.

== Exceptions ==
There are exceptions to the octet rule. 

=== Two Electrons ===
The main exception to the rule is hydrogen, which is at its lowest energy when it has two electrons in its valence shell. Helium (He) is similar in that it, too, only has room for two electrons in its only valence shell.

Hydrogen and helium have only one electron shell.  The first shell has only one s orbital and no p orbital, so it holds only two electrons.  Therefore, these elements are most stable when they have two electrons.  You will occasionally see hydrogen with no electrons, but H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is much less stable than hydrogen with one or two electrons.

Lithium, with three protons and electrons, is most stable when it gives up an electron.

=== Less Than an Octet ===
Other notable exceptions are aluminum and boron, which can function well with six valence electrons.  Consider BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The boron shares its three electrons with three fluorine atoms.  The fluorine atoms follow the octet rule, but boron has only six electrons.  Although atoms with less than an octet may be stable, they will usually attempt to form a fourth bond to get eight electrons.  BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is stable, but it will form BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; when possible. Most elements to the left of the carbon group have so few valence electrons that they are in the same situation as boron: they are ''electron deficient''. Electrons deficient elements often show metallic rather than covalent bonding.

=== More Than an Octet ===
In Period 3, the elements on the right side of the [[General_Chemistry/Periodic_Table|periodic table]] have empty d orbitals.  The d orbitals may accept electrons, allowing elements like sulfur and phosphorus to have more than an octet.  Compounds such as PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can form.  These compounds have 10 and 12 electrons around their central atoms, respectively.

&lt;center&gt;
{|
| [[Image:Xenonhexafluorid.svg]]
|Xenon hexafluoride uses d-electrons to form more than an octet.  This compound shows another exception:  a noble gas compound.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Odd Numbers ===
Some elements, notably nitrogen, have an odd number of electrons and will form somewhat stable compounds.  Nitric oxide has the formula NO.  No matter how electrons are shared between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms, there is no way for nitrogen to have an octet.  It will have seven electrons instead.  A molecule with an unpaired electron is called a ''free radical'' and radicals are highly reactive. So reactive that many of them only exist for a fraction of a second. As radicals go NO and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are actually remarkably stable. At low temperatures NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does react with itself to form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, its ''dimer'', that is not a radical. 

&lt;center&gt;

|Nitrogen dioxide has an unpaired electron.  (Note the positive charge above the N).

&lt;/center&gt;

One way to solve this would be to try to manually work out all the possible combinations and their sums. That would take a while. 

Instead, notice that each item is half the weight of the previous item. Lets assume you have less items and work out the general rule for any number of items, where each is twice as much as the next item:

 '''Items  Weights            Number of Combinations'''
 1      5                   '''1''': 5
 2      5, 10               '''3''': 5, 10, 15
 3      5, 10, 20           '''7''': 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
 4      5, 10, 20, 40      '''15''': 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75
 5      5, 10, 20, 40, 80

Without even listing them, we can see the pattern. The numbers 1, 3, 7, 15 follow the formula of 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; - 1, where n=1, 2, 3, 4 i.e. the number of items.

For 5 items, n=5, 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = '''31'''.

The pattern would continue for more items:
 6 - '''63'''
 7 - '''127'''
 8 - '''255'''

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Spikey. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Spikey~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

==Basic Concepts==

Before one gets too deep into learning C syntax and programming constructs, it is beneficial to learn the meaning of a few key terms that are central to a thorough understanding of C.

== Block Structure, Statements, Whitespace, and Scope==  

Now we '''discuss the basic structure of a C program'''. If you're familiar with [[w:Pascal (programming language)|PASCAL]], you may have heard it referred to as a '''block-structured''' language. C does not have complete block structure (and you'll find out why when you go over functions in detail) but it is still very important to understand what blocks are and how to use them. 

So what is in a '''block'''?  Generally, a block consists of executable '''statements'''.

Before blocks are explained, what is a statement? One way to put it is that statements are the text the compiler will attempt to turn into executable instructions, and the whitespace that surrounds them. An easier way to put it is that statements are bits of code that do things, like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int i = 6; /* this declares a variable 'i', and sets it to equal 6 */
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

You might have noticed the semicolon at the end of the statement. Statements in C always end with a semicolon (;) character. Leaving off the semicolon is a common mistake that a lot of people make, beginners and experts alike! So until it becomes second nature, be sure to double check your statements!

Since C is a &quot;free-format&quot; language, several statements can share a single line in the source file, like so:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* this declares the variables 'i', 'test', 'foo', and 'bar'
    note that ONLY 'bar' is set to six! */
int i, test, foo, bar = 6;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

There are several kinds of statements, and you've seen some of them. Assignment (i = 6;), conditional and flow-control. A substantial portion of this book deals with statement construction.

Now back to blocks. In C, blocks begin with an opening brace &lt;tt&gt;&quot;{&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; and end with a closing brace &lt;tt&gt;&quot;}&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Blocks can contain other blocks which can contain their own blocks, and so on.

Let's show an example of blocks.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int main(void)
{
    /* this is a 'block' */
    int i = 5;

    {
        /* this is also a 'block,' separate from the last one */
        int i = 6;
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Blocks come in handy with readability and scope. You'll learn a little more about scope in a second.

'''Whitespace''' refers to the tab, space and newline/EOL (End Of Line)&lt;!--Why can't I use the acronym element?--&gt; characters that separate the text characters that make up source code lines.  Like many things in life, it's hard to appreciate whitespace until it's gone. To a C compiler, the source code 

   printf(&quot;Hello world&quot;); return 0;

is the same as

   printf(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
   return 0;

which is the same as 

   printf (
   &quot;Hello world&quot;) ; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   return 0;
   

The compiler simply skips over whitespace.  However, it is common practice to use spaces (and tabs) to organize source code for human readability.  You can use blocks without a conditional, loop, or other statement to organize your code.

In C, most of the time we do not want other functions or other programmer's [[w:Subroutine|routines]] accessing data that we are currently manipulating. This is why it is important to understand the concept of scope.

'''Scope''' describes the level at which a piece of data or a function is visible. There are two kinds of scope in C, '''local''' and '''global'''. When we speak of something being '''global''', we speak of something that can be seen or manipulated from anywhere in the program. When we speak of something being '''local''', we speak of something that can be seen or manipulated only within the block it was declared.

Let's show some examples, to give a better picture of the idea of scope.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int i = 5; /* this is a 'global' variable, it can be accessed from anywhere in the program */

/* this is a function, all variables inside of it
    are &quot;local&quot; to the function. */
int main(void)
{
    int i = 6; /* 'i' now equals 6 */
    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i); /* prints a '6' to the screen, instead of the global variable of 'i', which is 5 */

    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

That shows a decent example of local and global, but what about different scopes ''inside'' of functions? (you'll learn more about functions later, for now, just focus on the &quot;main&quot; part.)

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* the main function */
int main(void)
{
    /* this is the beginning of a 'block', you read about those above */

    int i = 6; /* this is the first variable of this 'block', 'i' */

    {
        /* this is a new 'block', and because it's a different block, it has its own scope */

        /* this is also a variable called 'i', but in a different 'block',
            because it's in a different 'block' than the old 'i', it doesn't affect the old one! */
        int i = 5;
        printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i); /* prints a '5' onto the screen */
    }
    /* now we're back into the old block */

    printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i); /* prints a '6' onto the screen */

    return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Basics of Using Functions ==

'''Functions''' are a big part of programming. A function is a special kind of block that performs a well-defined task. If a function is well-designed, it can enable a programmer to perform a task without knowing anything about how the function works. The act of requesting a function to perform its task is called a '''function call'''. Many functions require a caller to hand it certain pieces of data needed to perform its task; these are called '''arguments'''. Many functions also return a value to the caller when they're finished; this is called a '''return value''' (the return value in the above program is '''0''').

The things you need to know before calling a function are:
* What the function does
* The data type (discussed later) of the arguments and what they mean
* The data type of the return value and what it means

All code other than global data definitions and declarations needs to be a part of a function.

Usually, you're free to call a function whatever you wish to. The only restriction is that every executable program needs to have one, and only one, '''main''' function, which is where the program begins executing.

We will discuss functions in more detail in a later chapter, [[C Programming/Procedures and functions]].

== The Standard Library ==

In 1983, when C was in the process of becoming standardized, the [[w:American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a standard specification of C known as &quot;ANSI C&quot;. That standard specification created a basic set of functions common to each implementation of C, which is referred to as the [[w:C standard library|Standard Library]]. The Standard Library provides functions for tasks such as input/output, string manipulation, mathematics, files, and memory allocation. The Standard Library does not provide functions that are dependent on specific hardware or operating systems, like graphics, sound, or networking. In the &quot;Hello, World&quot;, program, a Standard Library function is used (&lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;) which outputs lines of text to the [[Wikipedia:standard output|standard output]] stream.

Many Japanese verbs have pairs of ''transitive'' and ''intransitive'' verbs. Formally, the difference between these is that a transitive verb can take on a direct object, whereas an intransitive verb can not. There are a few pairs of distinct verbs in English that correlate to this: &quot;raise&quot;/&quot;rise&quot;, &quot;fell&quot;/&quot;fall&quot; and &quot;lay&quot;/&quot;lie&quot;.

This is best explained by example. Contrast the following two sentences:
{| {{Japanese example}}
|
! English || Verb || Japanese
|-
! Transitive
| (I) close the door. || 閉める (しめる) || ドアを閉める。
|-
! Intransitive
| The door closes. || 閉まる (しまる) || ドアが閉まる。
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; |
|-
! Transitive
| The teacher starts the class. || 始める (はじめる) || 先生が授業を始める。
|-
! Intransitive
| The class starts. || 始まる (はじまる) || 授業が始まる。
|-
! colspan=&quot;4&quot; |
|-
! Transitive
| The sun melts the ice. || 溶かす（とかす） || 太陽が氷を溶かす。
|-
! Intransitive
| The ice melts. || 溶ける（とける） || 氷が溶ける。
|}

The general patterns for transitive and intransitive sentences is:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;span style=&quot;color:gray&quot;&gt;(&lt;subject&gt; は/が)&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;direct object&gt; を/が || &lt;transitive verb&gt;。
|-
| &lt;subject&gt; が || || &lt;intransitive verb&gt;。
|}
The topics of intransitive verbs are usually inanimate.

Some parings are listed in the following table:

The rule of thumb is that intransitive verbs usually take nouns with the particles 「が」(''ga'') or 「は」(''wa'') that act as subjects, whereas transitive verbs take object nouns marked with 「を」(''o''). Transltive verbs can also take a ''ga''-subject or ''wa''-subject, although it may be ommitted. Note that some intransitive verbs can take an ''o''-object that indicates a location.  For example, 出る (&quot;to leave&quot;) can be used with a direct object that is a location from which the subject is to leave from.
See the table below for more examples:
{| {{Japanese example}} |
! English || Verb || Japanese
|-
! Transitive with を
| (I) took out my wallet from my bag. || 出す（だす） || 財布をカバンから出した。
|-
! Transitive with は and を
| I took out my wallet from my bag. || 出す（だす） || 私は財布をカバンから出した。
|-
! Intransitive with を
| (I) left home. || 出る（でる） || 家を出た。
|-
! Intransitive with は and を
| I left home. || 出る（でる） || 私は家を出た。
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Introduction'''==

Glycolysis, literally meaning &quot;to split sugar,&quot; is the initial step in any respiratory system. Glycolysis involves the breaking down of a sugar (generally glucose, although fructose and other sugars may be used) into more manageable compounds in order to produce energy. The net end products of glycolysis are two [[Wikipedia:Pyruvate|Pyruvate]], two [[Wikipedia:NADH|NADH]], and two ATP (A special note on the &quot;two&quot; ATP later). 

Glycolysis is a process that all organisms undergo; and therefore the most fundamental and primitive of all energy production systems.

==='''General Reaction'''===

The general reaction form for Glycolysis is as follows: 

Glucose + 2 ATP ----&gt; 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 4 ATP

The 4 ATP produced at the end means that there is actually a net production of 2 ATP because 2 ATP are consumed during the beginning stages of glycolysis.

=='''Simplified Explanation'''==

(Soon to Come)

=='''Detailed explanation'''==

==Energy Investment Phase==

'''Glycolysis''' occurs in the cytoplasm of a cell after glucose is ingested through the process of phagocytosis, or &quot;cell eating,&quot; in which the cell engulfs a solid compound. Once the glucose is inside the cytoplasm, one molecule of ATP splits and transfers a phosphate group to the glucose, or &quot;phosphorylates&quot; it, so that it becomes an ion which cannot leave the cell because the cell membrane is impermeable to ions. This step effectively allows cells to efficiently absorb and utilize glucose and keep any glucose molecules from escaping. The process of phosphorylation also makes the glucose chemically reactive. 

Once the glucose has been phosphorylated, it is called &quot;Glucose-6-Phosphate,&quot; which will be abbreviated G6P. The G6P is rearranged into Fructose-6-Phosphate (F6P) by a protein. When the F6P is created, another ATP molecule splits and the F6P is phosphorylated by another phosphate group. This phosphate is attached to an opposite end of the F6P molecule which is now called Fructose-1, 6-Biphosphate. This is done so that the molecule will be not only more chemically reactive but so that it will split due to the tensions placed upon the molecule by the two phosphate groups. (Phosphate groups have a negative charge; this allows them to be added to create incredibly useful energy compounds, ATP among them. Because like charges repel each other, the two phosphate groups are placed in positions that allow the glucose molecule to split roughly in half, although an enzyme called aldolase is still used to perform the division.) 

The Fructose-1, 6-Biphosphate, aided by aldolase, is split into Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DP) and Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate (63P), which are isomers of one another. The enzyme isomerase converts these molecules into one another. Because only 63P is used in the final stages of glycolysis, however, the reaction favors the conversion of DP into 63P. The overall effect of this reaction and the following steps is to send two molecules of 63P into the Energy Payoff phase of glycolysis.

==Energy Payoff Phase==

The 63P molecules then attach to an enzyme that removes two electrons from each 63P, therefore &quot;oxidizing&quot; the molecules. (Please note that the two 63P molecules do not attach to the enzyme at the same time; rather, two of the same enzyme would be used to carry out this reaction.) One electron from each 63P molecule is transferred to a hydrogen ion (H+; a hydrogen ion is also a proton) and one electron from each 63P molecule is transferred to NAD+, a cellular cofactor whose purpose is to carry electrons. The addition of electrons to the H+ and NAD+ combines the two into NADH. Because there are two 63P molecules, there are 2 NADH produced in this step. Since energy is released from the 63P molecules to allow the for the synthesis of the two NADH, some of the remaining energy attaches an inorganic phosphate group in the cell to each 63P molecule, forming 1, 3 Biphosphoglycerate (1,3B). 

The two chemically reactive 1,3B molecules now lose the phosphate group that was just attached to them to an ADP, or Adenosine Diphosphate, molecule. The phosphorylation of ADP creates an ATP molecule; because there are two 1,3B molecules, two ATP are created. With this step, the initial ATP investment is repaid, and the 1,3B molecules become 3-Phosphoglycerate, or 3P. After this step is completed, another enzyme relocates the phosphate group on the 3P, changing the 3P into 2-Phosphoglycerate, or 2P. 

After the 2P is created, an enzyme called enolase &quot;hydrolyzes&quot; the 2P molecules, which means that one water molecule is removed from each 2P molecule, which means that 2 H2O have been produced because there are two 2P molecules. In this particular case, the 2P is hydrolyzed so that the resulting Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is very unstable and reactive.

The final step of glycolysis involves a protein called BS. Upon attaching to the Pyruvate Kinase proteins, the two PEP are divided into two Pyruvate and two additional phosphate group which are used to phosphorylate two ADP molecules into two ATP molecules.

In prokaryotes, this all but concludes the respiration sequence. There is one final process that is undergone, however; fermentation. The process of glycolysis coupled with the process of fermentation is known as anaerobic respiration, &quot;anaerobic&quot; literally meaning &quot;without air.&quot; There are two main types of prokaryotic fermentation: alcohol fermentation and lactate fermentation.

==Fermentation==

In alcohol fermentation, the two pyruvate molecules lose two oxygen molecules and one carbon molecule are separated from the pyruvate and merge to become CO2 (Carbon Dioxide). The remaining molecule is called Acetaldehyde. The Acetaldehyde is &quot;reduced&quot; (or, gains electrons) by an NADH molecule. Because it is reduced, it increases in size. In this case, the NADH loses two electrons and two hydrogen ions, or protons, which returns it to its original NAD+ status. The two electrons and protons are then transferred to the Acetaldehyde, and it changes into Ethanol. Ethanol is the &quot;alcoholic&quot; ingredient in alcoholic beverages- in other words, a waste product of bacteria is one of the principal ingredients of beer, wine, and other drinks.

In lactate fermentation, no carbon dioxide is released and the pyruvate is instead reduced by the oxidation of NADH into lactate. In more quantitative terms, two protons and two electrons are removed from two NADH and are instead attached to two pyruvate molecules to create two lactate molecules. This lactate is also known as lactic acid, which happens to cause muscle pain and fatigue in animals. 

One might wonder why the NADH would be reverted to its original NAD+ status, since energy was used to create it in the first place. The NADH is actually oxidized into NAD+ so that a &quot;glycolytic cycle&quot; can be preserved: if the NAD+ had not been replenished, the prokaryote would eventually run out of organic materials, and it would no longer synthesize ATP, which would mean its eventual death. 

In eukaryotes, glycolysis is only the beginning of respiration. Instead of undergoing fermentation, he products of glycolysis are sent into the Krebs Cycle, explained in the next section.</text>

==CHAPTER ONE: THE THEME==

===Section 111: Part 1, Chapter 1, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Walking through a crumbling downtown Manhattan, Eddie Willers wonders why the world is in such a dilapidated state.  He comes upon a bum, who asks him &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;  
**After an unsuccessful discussion with Orren Boyle regarding yet another late order of steel, he returns to the Taggart Transcontinental Building in order to tell James Taggart the bad news about an unfulfilled steel order and another train wreck. His intent is to make Taggart see the desperate state of Taggart Transcontinental and the importance of the Rio Norte Line, which services one of the only remaining successful businesses in the world of Atlas Shrugged. After a bunch of invectives against successful businesses, Taggart shoos him away. Walking out, Eddie passes by Pop Harper, who complains in vain that the new typewriters cannot compare with the old ones.

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny Taggart is riding the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged#Taggart_Comet|Taggart Comet]] back to New York after inspecting the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]].  She hears a Brakeman whistling an unpublished piece from her favorite composer, Richard Halley, but the brakeman refuses to acknowledge this or say where he heard it.  After falling asleep and waking up, Dagny discovers the train has come to a stop at a siding.  She finds the train crew passively awaiting instructions, and gives them orders on how to proceed.  Faced with this incompetence, she decides to promote Owen Kellogg to superintendent of the Ohio Division.

==CHAPTER TWO: THE CHAIN==

===Section 121: Part 1, Chapter 2, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Hank Rearden watches triumphantly as the first order of Rearden Metal is poured.  As he walks home, he reflects on his life and the ten years of struggle spent to produce Rearden Metal.  To celebrate his triumph, Rearden makes a [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Bracelet]] out of the first Rearden Metal that is poured and gives it to his wife, Lillian.  Lillian belittles the triumph this gift symbolizes and uses the occasion to ridicule her husband's sentimentalism.  She makes a big deal about Rearden attending a party she is throwing in three months time (see [[../Chapters 6-10|section]] 161).  Also at the Rearden home are his brother Philip Rearden, his mother, and a friend, Paul Larkin, who has come to warn Rearden of possible trouble in Washington.  His family insults and criticizes Rearden for the crime of being able to support them.  He tries to understand their behavior but cannot come to acknowledge the depths of their depravity.  He believes they are expressing the same concerns that he feels, but only in a different way, and that he is morally required to tolerate them because they are weaker than he is.  This is the first glimpse of the [[w:Atlas Shrugged#Sanction of the victim|Sanction of the Victim]], which is a central concept of [[Atlas Shrugged]].  The abuse Rearden receives from his family in the second part of this scene creates a stark contrast to the triumphant achievement at the mill in the first part of the scene.

He had never asked anything of them; it was they who wished to hold him, they who pressed a claim on him - and the claim seemed to have the form of affection, but it was a form which he found harder to endure than any sort of hatred. He despised causeless affection, just as he despised unearned wealth.  (42)
**He [Rearden] could not condemn them without understanding; and he could not understand. (43)

==CHAPTER THREE: THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM==

===Section 131: Part 1, Chapter 3, Section 1===


*'''Plot summary:'''
**On top of a skyscraper barroom designed to look like a lowly cellar, James Taggart, Orren Boyle, Paul Larkin, and Wesley Mouch meet to work out a deal by which they can stop Hank Rearden and the success of [[w:Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|Rearden Metal]].  Boyle wants Taggart to get his friends in Washington to regulate the distribution of iron ore, depriving Rearden of the raw materials needed to market Rearden Metal.  In exchange, Boyle agrees to get the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|National Alliance of Railroads]] to drive the [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Phoenix-Durango]] railroad out of Colorado.  None of this is said openly or directly, of course.  Taggart also learns from Boyle that [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental's]] [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]] has been denuded of all but the barest equipment.

===Section 132: Part 1, Chapter 3, Section 2===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Recounts Dagny Taggart's childhood decision to run [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] and her rise in the company.  Recounts the history of the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]]: Millionaire playboy Francisco d'Anconia invested money in developing the San Sebastian Mines, and James Taggart and the Board of Directors assumed they could trust d'Anconia to deliver a winner.  Dagny opposed this project and almost quit when it was approved.  James Taggart confronts Dagny and demands to know what she has done to the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Line]].  She explains that she has moved anything of value out of Mexico so the &quot;looters&quot; would not get it when they nationalize the line.  James is scandalized by this but cannot immediately muster the courage to countermand her actions; instead, he threatens her with his impending report to the Board.
**After leaving the office, Dagny has a conversation with the owner of a newsstand about his cigarette collection.  He says there are no new brands anymore, and only a few brands still being made.  He talks of the cigarette as a symbol of man controlling nature, holding fire in his hands.

**Francisco d'Anconia - mentioned
**Hank Rearden
**James Taggart
**Mrs. Nathaniel Taggart - mentioned
**Nathaniel Taggart - mentioned
**Newsstand Owner
**Orren Boyle - mentioned

*'''Symbolism:'''
**The newsstand owner explicitly explains the symbolism of cigarettes: &quot;I like to think of fire held in man's hand.  Fire, a dangerous force, tamed at his fingertips.  I often wonder about the hours when a man sits alone, watching the smoke of a cigarette, thinking.  I wonder what great things have come from such hours.  When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind - and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.&quot;  This is a character explaining what cigarettes symbolize to him - it is not a use of literary symbolism.  
**The literary symbolism of this passage is established when the newsstand owner likens the fire of a cigarette to the fire of the mind.  In Greek mythology, it was this gift of fire that raised men up.  In Atlas Shrugged, it is the achievements of the mind that raise men up.  So the disappearance of most of the old brands of cigarettes, which the newsstand owner bemoans, is symbolic of the disappearance of the men of the mind. Note that it was Prometheus who gave fire to man for which he would be forever tormented by an eagle tearing at his immortal flesh. Thus, the bringer of gifts receives punishment rather than praise.

===Section 133: Part 1, Chapter 3, Section 3===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Eddie Willers ends a long day at work by having dinner in the employees' cafeteria of the Taggart Terminal.  There he meets the Mystery Worker.  They sit together and he tells them about the problems of the day and what Dagny Taggart is going to do to fix things.  He mentions that Dick McNamara is the contractor who will lay the new rails for the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]]. Eddie also reveals that Dagny does not go out, that she sits alone in her apartment listening to the music of Richard Halley. (Eddie will have many similar chats with this Mystery Worker throughout the book.)
**The cafeteria is described as follows:  &quot;The cafeteria lay underground.  It was a large room with walls of white tile that glittered in the reflections of electric lights and looked like silver brocade.  It had a high ceiling, sparkling counters of glass and chromium, a sense of space and light.&quot; This description is in sharp contrast to the most expensive barroom in New York, from section 131, that is atop a skyscraper but made to look like a cellar.  The contrast gives the chapter title - The Top and the Bottom - its irony.

==CHAPTER FOUR: THE IMMOVABLE MOVERS==

===Section 141: Part 1, Chapter 4, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny attempts to pinpoint the need of the world--motive power to keep it standing, movement to keep it immovable; the Taggart Transcontinental skyscraper rests not on its granite foundations, but in its engines--that's what keeps it going. With depressed thoughts, Dagny Taggart reminisces a visit to [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|United Locomotive Works]] to determine why they consistently fail to deliver the Diesel engines she ordered.  The President of ULW talks for hours without answering directly or saying anything of substance.  After returning to the office, Eddie Willers informs Dagny that Dick McNamara - the best contractor that can be found anywhere - has quit without explanation.  As Dagny walks home that night, she sees the depravity that passes for popular culture: books and movies that trivialize what is glorious, demonize what is moral, and exalt what is base; people who act as if pleasure were a sin that one gets away with.  Depressed, she returns home and listens to the soul tonic of Richard Halley.  While she listens, she recalls Halley's struggles as a young composer, his sudden success, and his mysterious disappearance.  She sees in the newspaper that Francisco d'Anconia has returned to New York amidst a scandal in which a married woman tries to kill her husband so she could be with Francisco, whom she identifies as her lover.  Francisco says he came to New York to witness the farce - but it is not the same farce people are led to believe in that he wants to witness.

This foreshadows another discovery in an even less competent factory - a motor that is priceless, but which is left abandoned by people who could not see its value.

**The [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|National Alliance of Railroads]] passes the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]] which gives them the power to dictate which railroads can operate in which regions of the country; specifically, the railroad with seniority gets precedence in a competitive area to eliminate dog-eat-dog competition.  The rule is crafted by [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Orren Boyle]] with the purpose of driving the [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Phoenix-Durango]] out of [[w:Places_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Colorado]], so [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] would not have to compete with them any longer. (It is part of a &quot;friendship&quot; made earlier with Taggart - I do your dirty work; you do mine.)  After the vote, [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|James Taggart]] storms into [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart]]'s office and gloats about how he has ruined their competitor, Dan Conway, which in his mind is a victory over Dagny.  She calls him a rotten bastard and rushes out.

[[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Conway]] admits the ruling is not fair, but he doesn't feel he has any right to fight the will of the majority.  He meekly resigns himself to running his railroads in [[w:Places_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Arizona]], or perhaps, pursuing reclusive pastimes such as fishing.  Conway states, &quot;I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed.  If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain.&quot;  This is an important passage because it is the first explicit statement of the concept of the [[w:Atlas Shrugged#&quot;Sanction of the Victim&quot;|Sanction of the Victim]]. Moreover, the term &quot;looters&quot; referring to the villain is first introduced in the context of the excuse of &quot;public welfare.&quot;

===Section 147: Part 1, Chapter 4, Section 7===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**[[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]] appears suddenly and unexpectedly in [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny Taggart's]] office.  He issues an ultimatum, saying if [[w:Companies_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Taggart Transcontinental]] fails to run trains the way his business requires, his business will fail - and he will drag them down with him. Wyatt had expected a spiel of excuses, as any well-educated looter would have given. However, [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Dagny]] surprises him by quietly assuring him, without excuses or explanations, that he will get the service he requires. Dagny knows full well Wyatt's basis from which to question Taggart Transcontinental's ability to service him. [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Wyatt]] states, &quot;You expect to feed off me while you can and to find another carcass to pick dry after you have finished mine.&quot;  He understands that the parasites are dependent upon him, and when he issues his ultimatum, he is refusing to grant the [[w:Atlas Shrugged#&quot;Sanction of the Victim&quot;|Sanction of the Victim]].  Thus [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Ellis Wyatt]] is a sharp contrast to [[w:Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Dan Conway]] in the previous section.  The responses of these two men to the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule]] represent opposite sides of the book's central conflict - one accedes to being a victim, one refuses.

===Section 148: Part 1, Chapter 4, Section 8===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny Taggart meets with Hank Rearden at his steel mill to tell him that, because of the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule she will need her rails in nine months instead of twelve.  She asks Rearden if he can deliver the order in time, and he tells her he will.  Dagny acknowledges that Rearden now holds Taggart Transcontinental in his power - if he fails to deliver, the railroad might collapse.  But, Rearden needs this project to succeed as well because it will prove the value of Rearden Metal, creating new markets for him.  They stand together in silence, watching as the first load of Rearden Metal is loaded onto the trains, both knowing what this new invention represents.  The two talk about business as if one business' success creates opportunities for another, which is in sharp contrast to the talk about &quot;destructive competition&quot; that was used to justify the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule earlier in this chapter. 
**The first traces of Dagny and Rearden's relationship becomes apparent, as Dagny has an epiphany. &quot;If joy is the aim and the core of existence, and if that which has the power to give one joy is always guarded as one's deepest secret, then they had seen each other naked in that moment.&quot; Rearden, however, is extremely stoic, and although this realization of joy is mutual, Rearden replies with, &quot;We're a couple of blackguards, aren't we?&quot; This disturbs Dagny and foreshadows the guilt that will plague Rearden, make him believe that his pleasure is depraved, and eventually undermine Rearden's ownership of Rearden Metal. 
**There is an apparent plot hole as to why Dagny did not buy the rail from Conway and skip the trouble of meeting a near impossible schedule. This hole is filled in later in the novel. Dagny has an argument with James Taggart, her brother, when he mentions he tries to purchase the rail from Dan Conway, who states in anger that not one foot of his rail will ever be sold to Taggart Transcontinental.  He later sells the dismembered pieces of his railroad at a huge discount to anyone - except Taggart Transcontinental.
**The chapter ends with the extension of the metaphor that the chapter opens with: Rearden states that &quot;we are the movers,&quot; thereby transferring the strength and burden of the skyscraper of Taggart Transcontinental to earthly flesh. Though machines rust when neglected, the movers - people like Rearden and Dagny - can adapt and are a self-sufficient source of fuel. They do not give up when disasters happen - they are the immovable movers.

==CHAPTER FIVE: THE CLIMAX OF THE D'ANCONIAS==

===Section 151: Part 1, Chapter 5, Section 1===

**After the government of [[w:Places_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Mexico]] suddenly nationalizes the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]] thinking they would be a great new source of revenue for the state, they discover that the mines are completely worthless--there was never any chance of mining copper there, so Francisco d'Anconia must have known all along the project was doomed to failure.  Eddie Willers shows the news report to Dagny Taggart, who tries to figure out how this could be, and finally tells Eddie to get her an appointment with &quot;the bastard.&quot;  Eddie warns about meeting him in a way that indicates the emotional significance seeing Francisco will hold for Dagny.

===Section 152: Part 1, Chapter 5, Section 2===

*'''Plot summary:'''
In this long section, Dagny walks to the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|Wayne-Falkland Hotel]] to confront Francisco d'Anconia.  While walking, she reminisces her childhood with Francisco and we learn why this man is so significant to her.
**Francisco had been a childhood friend of Dagny and Eddie Willers.  He spent his childhood all over the world, because his father wanted him to know the world as his domain.  But for one month every summer he visited the Taggart estate, and his visit was the highlight of Dagny and Eddie's year.  Francisco had an unlimited capacity for joy, and he loved tackling new challenges - and he performed each superlatively, as to him, a job done, is a job done well.  Following the tradition of each d'Anconia heir in increasing the family fortune, Francisco's great goal for his life was to run [[Atlas Shrugged/Companies|d'Anconia Copper]] so well it would double in size.  He talked to Dagny about their great futures running their respective family businesses - this was the vision of the future Dagny came to expect. Yet, throughout this idyllic recollection, mention is made of James Taggart, who represents the evil in the world. Though Francisco disregards him as an irrelevant object, rather than a person, the evil which Taggart represents will be an obstacle. 
**When Dagny was sixteen she began working as a night-operator at the Rockdale Station of [[Atlas Shrugged/Companies|Taggart Transcontinental]], much to her mother's chagrin.  Her mother was worried that Dagny showed no interest in boys, or in feminine things in general.  She decided to throw Dagny a coming out party at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel.  Dagny loved the idea, and stepped into the ball with the eager expectation of finding people who were as filled with joy as Francisco, but instead she found they were lifeless fools who believed that it was the lighting that made things brilliant, the decorations that made things happy.  In later years Dagny would discover her vision of the future was mistaken in the same way, and she would often think back to this party and wonder why people seemed incapable of living life in joy, why they lived instead with a constant undertone of fear and unhappiness.  Where were the men of joy?  Where were the men who were appropriate for life on earth?
**That summer, when Francisco returned, he and Dagny discovered they were in love, and spent the summer going off together and making love in the cellar of an abandoned log cabin, where no one could discover them.  They kept it secret not out of guilt - they knew not that such joy could be sin - but because they felt it was too personal and too special to share with anyone else.
**The romance continued for eight years, as Francisco rose to become head of d'Anconia Copper and Dagny finished college and began her rise at Taggart Transcontinental. Then, when she was 24, Francisco unexpectedly invited her to his suite at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel.  She was shocked to see, for the first time, pain in his face, and that he was torn by the obvious struggle within him that he could not explain to her.  They made love for what will be the last time, and Francisco was stricken with a burden unbecoming of him, a grief and bitterness at odds with his usual happiness.  He begged Dagny to help him fight him (Galt's opus) even though he's right.  He regained his composture and warned her not to be shocked or hurt by the things he will do, and told her not to wait for him.
**After that night, she did not hear anything about Francisco for a year, and then she began to hear the stories of a new Francisco, a worthless, irresponsible playboy, with no apparent interest in his work.  At first she could not believe these things, but as the years passed and the stories piled up, she had no choice.  Time deadened her pain, but she never found another man to love -- another man for whom life was joy.
**When she arrives at the Wayne-Falkland and confronts Francisco, she accuses him of deliberately plotting the swindle of the [[w:Things_in_Atlas_Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]].  She tries to determine his motives, and he leads her on, eventually telling her that he is deliberately trying to destroy the producers, that his goal in the San Sebastian Mines was to waste millions of dollars, and that Ellis Wyatt will be next one to be destroyed and Taggart Transcontinental will collapse as well; he tells her that she is the one he must fight.  She could never believe he had become so corrupt, but since she does not see the full truth of his motive, she has no choice but to believe it now.

They dislike me, not because I do things badly, but because I do them well. They dislike me because I've always had the best grades in class. I don't even have to study. I always get A's. Do you suppose I should try to get D's for a change and become the most popular girl in school?&quot; Francisco stopped, looked at her [Dagny] and slapped her face. (98)

==CHAPTER SIX: THE NON-COMMERCIAL==

===Section 161: Part 1, Chapter 6, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**At the expense of postponing the myriad commercial tasks that must still be done, Hank Rearden reluctantly attends a party thrown by his wife on their wedding anniversary.  Lillian Rearden has invited her circle of friends, which includes the &quot;heart of the country's culture&quot;, the so-called intellectual elite whose opinions are shaping the times.  This is a bit of an insult, though, as the whole country is falling apart.  As these friends speak, we are introduced to the ideas that are causing the collapse of society:
***Dr. Simon Pritchett, the nation's leading philosopher, declares that man is a miserable bit of protoplasm, there are no standards, reason is a superstition, the purpose of philosophy is to prove we can know nothing and that there is no meaning to be found in life, and that when people realize this they will be more &quot;tractable.&quot;
***Balph Eubank is the literary leader of the age (albeit, his books do not sell), declares that suffering is the essence of life, and that free will, achievement, and happiness are laughable concepts of old literature. Plot, he says, is a primitive vulgarity in literature.  Moreover, life is about suffering and frustration, that the only thing to live for is brotherlove.  He later says, that the machine age has destroyed man's humanity, observing that Dagny Taggett runs a railroad rather than practicing the beautiful art of the handloom and bearing children.
***Bertram Scudder, the editor, declares that property rights are a superstition. Moreover, even though he has written an editorial filled with groundless insults against Rearden, he is present at Rearden's party.   
***Claude Slagenhop, president of [[Characters in Atlas_Shrugged|Friends of Global Progress]], declares that need is the only consideration, that an empty belly is a fact, and that this consideration justifies anything, that ideas are just hot air - that right is whatever is good for society, and that the people have the right to seize what they need.
***All of them are introduced in the context of their pro-Equalization of Opportunity Bill views.
**Rearden is shocked by the arrival of Dagny Taggart.  When they talk he is formal and distant, quite unlike the easy manner that characterized their business dealings.  Dagny is taken aback by his manner and is puzzled when he gives her the cold shoulder throughout the evening.  
**Rearden argues with Lillian after he discovers she has invited Bertram Scudder to the party.  Scudder had trashed Rearden in an article.  He cannot understand why she would invite a man who is so hostile to him, and why Lillian seems to enjoy his anger.  He thinks there is some riddle to her character that he should try to understand, but he cannot accept the insanity that would make it possible for her to take pleasure in his fury.  
**Just then, Francisco d'Anconia enters, who will in due time provide Rearden with the answer to this riddle.  A self-made man, Rearden despises Francisco as a worthless profligate who does not know how to deserve the great gift of inherited wealth.  He tells Lillian to &quot;keep that man away from me.&quot;  But Francisco has come for the specific purpose of meeting Rearden, and it is only a matter of time until he corners him.  
**First, though, Francisco circulates, and as Lillian's friends spout out their inanities, he glibly refutes them. When James Taggart confronts him about the failure of the [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|San Sebastian Mines]], Francisco justifies his actions as being in accords with the &quot;virtue&quot; of the times. 
*** Francisco tells a disbelieving and frustrated Taggart that the San Sebastian Mines is the &quot;practical realization of the highest moral order.&quot; Frisco has taken no personal interest, is completely selfless in it; he has eliminated the useless presence of the exploiter-owner. He has hired based on need, rather than ability. Focusing on the livelihood on the employees, he has constructed a settlement for his employees regardless of the place's potential for copper. He has not profited, but has loss - as human beings should, according to the morality of the times, for privation and imperfection are man.
**When Francisco does meet Rearden, their talk is prolific.  Francisco asks why Rearden is willing to support those who are helpless, who never show their gratitude towards him, and who, in fact, openly denounce him as an evil exploiter.  He leaves this an open question.  Rearden at this point of the story is aware that there is something wrong with the world, but does not know what, while Francisco does know.  In this, their first meeting, Francisco tries to place in Rearden's mind the seeds of understanding.  The reader is in the same position as Rearden, and the scene is meant to do the same for the reader, preparing us for the explicit revelation of Galt's Speech.  Francisco leaves Rearden with two ambiguous facts: 
*** They have a terrible weapon against Rearden, and the evidence for this is his unhappiness. 
*** He warns Rearden about the sin of forgiveness. He also asserts that everything Rearden had said to him is true, except his belief that the commercial is evil.  As Francisco leaves him, Rearden is filled with a feeling of wishing him to stay, for, unbeknownst to him, Francisco has given him the beginnings of a moral sanction. 
**Dagny approaches Rearden, attempting to make smalltalk with him by commenting on the debasing nature of his guests, casually stating her belief that celebration should only be done by those who mean it, implying that the drudgery of the milieu is due to their attempt to be more senseless and meaningless than usual. When Rearden denies that they're missing something, a frustrated and confused Dagny leaves, wandering into a group of &quot;respectable women.&quot; She hears a fable of John Galt, as the millionaire who had found Atlantis and lost it all in the process. Francisco is nearby, and he asserts his belief of her story, although Dagny finds it another ludicrous myth.
**As the scene reaches a climax, Halley's music, as remixed into cacaphony by an inept Mort Liddy, permeates the room. Dagny is leaving the party before she loses her composure.  What she has slowly come to realize is that she came to the party hoping to make Rearden aware of her as a woman, not just a business partner.  She was distraught when Rearden responds to her with indifference, and upset when Francisco is the only one who sees her as an object of sexual desire--she is also angered that Francisco would call her appearance a waste, that the heroes would have to succumb to wasting their time in miasmaic milieus such as this party of aimless people.  She has also been pushed to the edge by the inane ramblings of Lillian's guests.  As she walks out, she is pushed over the edge when she hears Mort Liddy's bastardized treatment of her favorite song, [[Things in Atlas Shrugged|Halley's Fourth Concerto]].  At that moment, Dagny hears Lillian denigrating the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|bracelet]] of [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] that she has been wearing all night as a joke, carefully pronouncing its oddity in the midst of an extravagant display of excessive jewelry.  Lillian jokes that it is supposed to be priceless because it is the first thing ever made from Rearden Metal, but she would gladly exchange it for a common diamond bracelet any time.  In an act of supreme audacity, Dagny removes her diamond bracelet and offers it in exchange, saying that if Lillian is not a coward she would take the offer.  Lillian is taken aback but accepts the trade, not realizing that this act would ultimately undermine her secret weapon against Rearden.  Hank Rearden is furious at Dagny's gall, for the trade symbolizes Lillian's passing her status of &quot;wife&quot; to Dagny.  Rearden's guilt manifests in his acting like the ideal husband throughout the rest of the evening.  (This scene symbolizes Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas_Shrugged|theory of sex]] that will be elucidated in the next section.)

**&quot;I am in favor of a free economy. A free economy cannot exist without competition. Therefore, men must be forced to compete. Therefore, we must control men in order to force them to be free.&quot; - Dr. Pritchett (127)
**&quot;Plot is a primitive vulgarity in literature&quot; - Balph Eubank
***&quot;Quite so. Just as logic is a primitive vulgarity in philosophy.&quot; - Dr. Pritchett
***&quot;Just as melody is a primitive vulgarity in music.&quot; - Mort Liddy (129)
**&quot;Need is the only consideration. If people are in need, we've got to seize things first and talk about it afterwards.&quot; - Claude Slagenhop (130)
**&quot;But surely you wouldn't want me to do anything about it. My mines and your railroad were seized by the will of the people. You wouldn't want me to oppose the will of the people, would you?&quot; - Francisco d'Anconia to James Taggart (137)
**&quot;Isn't it generally conceded that when you hire a man for a job, it is his need that counts, not his ability? Doesn't everyone believe that in order to get the goods, all you have to do is need them? I have carried out every moral precept of our age, I expected gratitude and a citation of honor. I do not understand why I am being damned.&quot; - Francisco d'Anconia (138)
**&quot;To me, there's only one form of human depravity - the man without a purpose.&quot; - Hank Rearden (142)
***&quot;If one's actions are honest, one does not need the predated confidence of others, only their rational perception. The person who craves a moral blank check of that [the confidence] kind has dishonest intentions.&quot;

*'''Plot summary'''
**After the anniversary party, late in the evening, Hank Rearden enters his wife's bedroom with the pretext of having sex with her.  Yet, he is disgusted by Lillian, not caring to admit his defeat by leaving.  Lillian accedes perfunctorily, and starts talking about the party, because talking is what people are supposed to do before making love.  As she jabbers, Rearden wonders why she married him, and recalls the details of their courtship and early marriage.  He thinks about what a torture it has become, pretending that he and Lillian still find their marriage and their sex life rewarding.  By the time she is done talking, Rearden has lost his desire and returns to his own room.  It is his first glimpse of the premise, from Rand's [[Concepts in Atlas Shrugged|sexual theory]], that one's sexual desires are an expression of one's values.

==CHAPTER SEVEN: THE EXPLOITERS AND THE EXPLOITED==

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny Taggart visits the construction site of the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Rio Norte Line]] near the [[Things in Atlas_Shrugged|Wyatt oil fields]].  Construction is being supervised by Ben Nealy, who is incompetent but the best contractor Dagny could find.  She meets Ellis Wyatt who indicates he now knows what she is, and that he respects her.  Hank Rearden is also on hand, designing a [[Technology in Atlas_Shrugged|Rearden Metal]] bridge to show off his new metal.  The two get along as they always had, as if the party had never happened.
**Rearden mentions he is flying back east, and Dagny asks if she can go back with him.  He tells her no, because he is flying to Minnesota before heading to New York.  Later at the airfield, Dagny discovers Rearden was lying -- that he did fly straight to New York.  Dagny has no clue why Rearden would flat out lie to her.

**Eddie Willers informs Dagny that the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|State Science Institute]] has released a sham condemnation of Rearden Metal that has no actual facts as to any problems with the metal, but essentially an innuendo of doubt as to whether it is safe or not.  
**Dagny visits the Institute to try to find out why the statement was made.  The Director of the Institute, Dr. Robert Stadler, refuses to denounce the statement, which was made without his knowledge or consent, even though he knows it to be untrue, because to denounce the statement would destroy the institute, which is all he cares about.  
**Dr. Stadler doesn't really have any concern as to how people are going to think about the false statement his institute has made, because he has essentially lost faith in humanity.  He notes when he was at the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Patrick Henry University]] he had three star pupils: Francisco d'Anconia who become a worthless playboy; Ragnar Danneskjöld who become a pirate; and a third very promising student who went nowhere.

Dagny delivers an ultimatum: she will finish the Rio Norte Line herself, on her own terms, disassociating herself and the publically notorious project from Taggart Transcontinental.  She also demands Eddie Willers be appointed Vice President of Operations in her absence (but it will actually still be her running the company, just nobody will admit it.)  In deciding what to call the new railroad she will operate, when suggesting her own name, Jim feels that her using her own name will suggest there is a connection between the two companies (which everyone will know but nobody will admit).  Flippantly, she suggests calling the line The John Galt line, and decides to use that name.

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny spends time selling bonds to finance the construction of the John Galt Line.  Through a desperate display of emotional turmoil, Francisco d'Anconia struggles in his refusal to purchase the bonds for reasons he cannot say.  Dagny reduces herself to begging, hoping that Francisco will have pity for her cause -- he has already thrown away many more millions of dollars in his depraved endeavors.  Tortured that he cannot tell Dagny the full truth behind his refusal, he gives her one crucial hint -- &quot;that contradictions do not exist, whenever you believe you've found one, check your premises.&quot;   He is shocked when he finds out the name of the railroad, because she did it for the effect, that it represents &quot;the hopeless&quot; and suggests that if it is that way, let John Galt come and claim his line.  Francisco's response is, &quot;He will.&quot;
**Dagny visits Rearden to place the &quot;first official order&quot; for Rearden Metal rails for the John Galt Line.  Dagny shows Rearden a list of the Line's bondholders upon request.  The bondholders are the remaining great businesses from [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|Colorado]] and other places have put up their own money to have the line built. In contrast to Francisco's tortured refusal to Dagny's begging, Hank Rearden makes an unsolicited offer to buy the largest block of bonds, not because he's offering her charity, but because he knows he will make a big profit off her work. (In their conversation, it is revealed that the bonds are convertible and high-yield.)

She wants Rearden to give his skillless brother Philip a job in the steel mill.  Rearden refuses because Philip can't do the work.  His mother tries to manipulate Rearden by saying he only thinks of justice and has no love.  To the astonishment of is mother, Rearden responds saying, &quot;Mother, I'm running a steel plant--not a whorehouse.&quot; His mother retaliates by saying, &quot;What are... your mills--a holy temple of some kind?&quot; Despite her tone, Rearden finds himself agreeing in the sacredness of his mills. His mother attempts to broach up morality, &quot;Don't you ever think of people and of your moral duties?&quot; Rearden says that if he ever gives a job to Philip, he wouldn't be able to face any competent man who needs work and deserves it. His mother then attempts to warp morality with the statement that, &quot;Virtue is the giving of the undeserved.&quot; Rearden ends the meeting with finality, &quot;You don't know what you're saying. I'm not able ever to despise you enough to believe that you mean it.&quot;
**Rearden next has a meeting with Mr. Ward, the honest owner of a family-owned plant that makes harvest equipment. Ward has spent months trying to get a meeting with Rearden -- his goal being to explain the full truth of his situation, that just a little bit of Rearden steel would keep his company running, and he would be ever so grateful. Although his plant is already running at maximum, Rearden agrees to help. Ward's appearance and manner of speech is a stark contrast to Rearden's mother; Ward is fully conscious of his position, that though he owns a successful plant, he is in a position of a beggar, while Rearden's mother, who is the real beggar, acts as if Rearden owes her his success.

**Eddie is ashamed to see The Worker whom he's known for years, because for the moment, Eddie is Vice President of Operations of Taggart Transcontinental while Dagny has been disentitled of her position, and while it would be an honor for him to be a stooge for her, in some undefined way he feels he is a (greasy) stooge for Jim Taggart.  
**Eddie tells The Worker how Dwight Sanders has taken over the bankrupt United Locomotive Works so they should soon be receiving new Diesel locomotives. He also mentions that Sanders is now crucially important to Taggart Transcontinental -- the new line will need diesels from him.
**While updating The Worker on the strategic needs of the company, Eddie broaches up the truth of the matter: that, all around, the great men are forced to relinquish their status, while lesser men become their stooges. 
**Eddie ends the conversation with the naming of the line -- the John Galt Line. Eddie doesn't like the name, but The Worker does.

As she raises her head, she sees a shadow indicating some person is thinking of walking into her office. The man who is about to enter the office stops at the door, then changes his mind and walks away.  Instead of feeling the fear of a potential intruder, Dagny runs out but finds no one out there; all she can see is the empty street and the entrance to the Taggart Transcontinental Building's train tunnels.

===Section 183: Part 1, Chapter 8, Section 3===
*'''Plot summary:'''
**Rearden, required to do so because of the Equalization of Opportunity Law, sells his iron ore mines to a friend of his family, Paul Larkin, and hates having to do so because he sees Larkin as unworthy. When Larkin says that he will always consider the mines to belong to Rearden, that this ownership business is a mere legal triviliaty, Rearden declares one of his foundational principles: &quot;Either I own a property or I don't (208).&quot; The truth of the matter is that, now that he has the official rights, Larkin can do whatever he wants against Rearden. Rearden does not want to be at anyone's mercy. Moreover, unlike Dagny, he will not allow anyone -- least of all Larkin -- to be his stooge. 
**When Rearden sells his coal mines to Ken Dannager, it's almost painless, because he respects Dannager. But, when Dannager offers to sell Rearden coal at cost, Rearden refuses and even offers to pay more for the coal. Rearden wants the small triumph of having defeated the irascible incumbents by paying a worthwhile man the money he's worth -- and since he's paying all the incompetent men the market value, he'd have to hike up the price to meet Dannager's worth.
**Summoned by Rearden for a last-minute business venture, Eddie Willers eats breakfast at Rearden's suite at the Wayne-Falkland Hotel in New York.  Rearden recognizes that Taggart Transcontinental is in financial trouble and cannot pay its first payment coming up in a week for Rearden Metal. On account of his metal, he proposes to give the railroad a six month delay in paying its bills.  Eddie thanks him profusely, but Rearden makes it clear to him that this is not an act of charity -- Rearden has received a lot of money, which he cannot use, from the purchases of his mines and ores from the looters, and giving Taggart Transcontinental a break is a sort of fuel in his fight against the looters.

**Public Opinion - without any evidence or proof - is that the Rearden Metal rail of the John Galt line will break or fail, and that the Rearden Metal bridge will collapse. Jim Taggart informs Dagny he's afraid of public opinion.  Dagny tells him how their ancestor, Nat Taggart, only envied one of his competitors, who said, &quot;The public be damned!&quot; because he wished he had said it.
**A delegate of the Union of Railroad Engineers tries to blackmail Dagny by saying they won't allow her to run trains on the [[Places in Atlas Shrugged|John Galt Line]], whereupon she orders him out of her office.  He changes his tone when she refuses to acceed to his blackmail.  She states she won't make anyone work on the train, she will ask for volunteers.

**Dagny and Hank ride the first train on the John Galt line with Pat Logan driving the train at an unprecedented 100 mph. Taggart workers and local townspeople line the sides of the track along the way to celebrate -- and to act as guards of honor. In the blink of an eye, they cross the bridge made of Rearden Metal without any trouble and arrive at Wyatt Junction. Wyatt and other industrialists greet and congratulate Hank and Dagny.
**Hank, Dagny, and Wyatt have dinner together at Wyatt's mansion out in the woods. Wyatt has provided them a sanctuary away from the mindless media that will, doubtlessly, be bandwagoning on the heroes' success they had denied as impossible, just a few hours ago. This is the first time Rearden has seen Wyatt in person -- and Wyatt appears as his true happy self, unmarred by his usual mask of anger. The success of the John Galt Line has made Wyatt boundlessly happy, but his happiness quickly diminishes when his old pessimistic bitterness returns -- that this will not last. 
**Wyatt shows Hank and Dagny to where they will be staying and Hank and Dagny consummate their love for each other. See [[Ayn Rand's Theory of Sex]]

===Section 192: Part 1, Chapter 9, Section 2===
*'''Plot summary:'''
**James Taggart finds himself wandering down a slum street plagued with a discontent he cannot pinpoint, succumbing to feelings of contempt and disgust in lieu of cogent thoughts. The setting is dark, the weather damp; Taggart has a cold, and he can't find his handkerchief. With the task of purchasing paper tissues and the malice of hoping the store will be out of business soon, he walks into a dime store in the district, the only spot of light in the dark decay of the slum neighborhood. The contrast between the dark decay of the slums that Taggart walks into and the brightness of the dime store sharpens the difference between Brooks and Taggart. Brooks, an innocent salesgirl at the dime store, is naive enough to see in Taggart a genuine hero. Taggart is amused by her ignorance and also drawn to her by it. Moreover, she does not regard him with the secret contempt of fellow looters, who know that Taggart's so-called &quot;greatness&quot; is gained in underhand tricks, rather than genuinely. Having been askew by the media's muckracking of Taggart as one of the supporters of the John Galt Line, she views him as one of the truly heroic. Taggart's true motive, however, is not to deceive himself that he is great. Although a part of him seems to want greatness, as if jealous of Rearden's ability to invent that metal, he wouldn't be happy if he receives that greatness because it's unearned--but he does not know this, as he lets feelings bypass thoughts. Taggart's true motive is feeling the superiority that he has something over her--that he's deceived her. To him, she is a girl with the same spirit of the heroes he despises, and deceiving her, to him, is like putting something over the heroes. When he brings her back home, having resisted the &quot;customary action&quot; of taking advantage of her sexually, she praises him, saying that anyone else would have. Taggart smugly asks if she would have, and Brooks runs away, abashed and ashamed. Taggart is satisfied that he has rendered the feelings of the profane into the sacred spirit Brooks represents.

**After spending an aimless week of wandering, Rearden confronts Dagny with the characteristic restlessness of the heroes, &quot;Does relaxing have to be purposeless?&quot; In reply, Dagny asks him which factory he wants to visit. They start visiting abandoned factories and ore mines. They come across the Twentieth Century Motor Company. But, the rampant decay around the factory is depressing; moreover, it foreshadows the emotional context in which the world's greatest material treasure is to be found. Dagny finds in the company the broken remnants of a motor that would run on static electricity. While all other valuables have been looted from the factory, the significance of the motor has been heartfallingly disregarded, the re-usable parts of the motor having been torn off. Rearden states the good the motor could have done, implying that all the loot taken away from the company wouldn't have been worth the potential of the motor. Those who had run the company to its ends were not capable of realizing the worth of the motor; their lack of judgment parallels that of the incomptency of the incumbents who now hold power over the world.

The clerk describes Yonts as not the kind of person who operates things, that he &quot;doesn't want to ''make'' money, only to ''get'' it.&quot; The clerk tells them that Yonts had sold the parts of the factory piece-meal after he bought it and that scavengers from Starnesville probably took everything else to use as kindling. He admits that Yonts bought it from a Mayor Bascom of Rome. When the clerk asks Rearden and Dagny what they're looking for, Rearden replies saying that it is a friend they've lost, a friend who used to work at the factory.

**Dagny and Rearden visit Bascom in Rome. Bascom is the type of man who believes that one can only become rich by &quot;cutting corners&quot; and bending laws, and he's open about this, &quot;as if a fellow cheat displaying his shrewdness to his partners in guilt.&quot; Bascom rambles on about how he can't stand a man with principles, and Rearden is forced to have to clue him in with questions. Bascom mentions that he managed to take a few items before he sold it to Mark Yonts--Jed Starnes' mahogany desk and a mermaid shower stall. When Rearden figures out to ask him which bankruptcy sale he bought it from, Bascom finally tells that it was from the Community National Bank, run by Eugene Lawson, the banker with a heart. Bascom implies in passing that much of the poverty is because of the crash of the bank. Rearden again tells him that they are looking for a friend. Bascom replies that it must be a good friend if they would go through all this trouble to find him, &quot;you and the charming lady who is not your wife.&quot;
**Rearden is enraged. But, when Dagny asks Bascom why he thinks so, Bascom tells them that married couples don't look as if they have a bedroom on their minds because &quot;in this world, either you're virtuous or you enjoy yourself. Not both.&quot; 
**When they leave Bascom, Rearden apologizes to Dagny. Dagny, however, tells him to think through the man's explanation, revealing that Dagny knows the fetters that Hank's family has around him. 
**Rearden gets paranoid about sending their engineers down to sift through the remains of the factory for more details of the motor, fearing that others would find out about their furtive romance. Dagny effortlessly bypasses his pessimism saying she'd call her engineers down here to search the factory, saying that she was on vacation. 
**Dagny reaches a long distance phone to call Eddie. Eddie is panicked, his words foreboding, &quot;I think they're planning to kill Colorado.&quot;

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny returns to New York. She hides the motor in a vault in an abandoned Taggart tunnel that used to hold an emergency electric generator. This is symbolic of the motor's role in the state of things--it has the potential to power the world in this emergency state.
**The media has muckraked the following: 
***Union of Locomotive Engineers demanding the maximum speed of trains be set at 60 mph. 
***Union of Railway Constructors and Brakemen demand that the trains be reduced to 60 cars. (James Taggart would later argue that because of the massive unemployment, having less cars per train would divide up the work.) 
***The neighboring states of Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona demand that the number of trains running in Colorado not to exceed the number of trains run in each of neighboring states. (Parallel: Brother's keeper become State's keeper.)
***Orren Boyle vies for the Preservation of Livelihood Law limiting the production of Rearden Metal to that of the output of other steel mills of equal plant capacity. 
***Mowens demands a Fair Share Law so that every customer of Rearden Metal gets an equal share of it. (Ironically, just a few months ago, he had refused to make switches out of Rearden Metal.)
***Scudder demands for the Public Stability Law forbidding Eastern businesses from moving out of states.
***Wesley Mouch, the Top Co-ordinator of the Bureau for Economic Planning and National Resources makes a bunch of ambiguous statements repeating the phrases &quot;emergency powers&quot; and &quot;unbalanced economy.&quot;
**Dagny reminisces about Eddie's despair and James Taggart's response. Taggart had argued for each of the demands above, albeit each one has the potential to destroy Taggart Transcontinental. When confronted with this, Taggart adamantly states that he &quot;fully intends to protect the interests of Taggart Transcontinental.&quot; Dagny points out that it is impossible if he intends to kill Colorado. Taggart claims there is no need for panic, that Dagny had predicted disaster for the Anti-dog-eat-dog-rule, but it's yet to come. Dagny points out that that was because she saved them! She ominously points out that if she doesn't save them, who will? 
**All this does not seem real to her while underground. Dagny realizes that finding the man who created the motor is more important than anything, albeit the impending legislature may easily stifle her business.

===Section 200: Part 1, Chapter 10, Section 4===
*'''Plot summary:'''
**The section begins with Rearden realizing that he cannot fight both battles: the fight against the incumbent gangs vying for the restrictive laws and the fight against the traditional gangs of ruffians for ore to run his mines. Rearden's purchasing manager would later tell him that he's not the type of man who would win the fight in Washington, that either he's good at running the mills or running to Washington. 
**Larkin, who had bought Rearden's mines c/o The Equalization of Opportunity Bill, has shipped the ore to Boyle instead of Rearden. Moreover, he's using railway transportation instead of lake shipping in order to keep his friendship with Taggart. 
**Rearden has been reduced to furtive bargains with ungainly sources, such as ruffian gangs, to obtain his ore. Rearden finds himself unable to see his own cause as right because he feels guilt for his secret relationship with Dagny. He does not believe in degrees of evil, thus seeing himself as one of the evil ones, he finds himself unable to fully condemn the looters. He would fight as one guilty wretch against the others. But, he finds that it is all worth it because of Dagny. 
**Rearden returns home late. Lillian offers him the duty of a wife, but Rearden, who is now in love with Dagny, is disgusted. Lillian hints at her motive in wanting him--not in the gutter sense. She, like his family, would hold onto him by his sense of duty and guilt, and this is how they are ''having him.'' 
**When Lillian finally leaves, Rearden falls asleep consoled by sexy thoughts of Dagny.

**Dagny meets with Eugene Lawson, who is now a member of the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources, one of the controllers of the world. Lawson, thinking she's here to leech dirty news from him, states he is not ashamed of his past presidentship of the Community National Bank of Madison.
**Dagny inquires about the Twentieth Century Motor Company, but Lawson claims that whatever or whomever she's searching for would be of less importance than a friendship with Wesley Mouch, which he can obtain for her. Dagny believes that he's wrong, that the man she is looking for is more important than anything.

**Hunsacker's tag line is &quot;I never had a chance.&quot; He tells of a life where, from his perspective, he has been massively cheated on all levels--the wealth ''entitled to him'' made impossible because of averse circumstances that seem to reoccur. Hunsacker claims he is the only man who has beaten Midas Mulligan. Upon Mulligan's rejection of a loan to him, Hunsacker had brought his case to court. Hunsacker had appealed to a higher court, when Judge Narrangansett rejected his suit against Mulligan. The higher court reversed Narrangensett's decision. 
**Dagny recalls her memory of Midas Mulligan, a famous banker. He had disappeared, suddenly, without a trace. His company had also liquidated itself suddenly -- every single penny of it liquidated, the company completely wiped out. Narrangansett had disappeared shortly after.
**Dagny recalls Judge Narrangetsett, the ideally impartial judge who is likened to the blind-folded statue of justice.

==CHAPTER ONE: The Man Who Belonged on Earth==

===Section 211: Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**While waiting for Dr. Ferris to arrive, Dr. Stadler paces in his office and thinks about the outrageous weather and the Ferris' outrageous book. Stadler is worried about how the book will be received. Although it was not written by him, it was published by the State Science Institute, and whatever notoriety it acquires will inevitably be attributed to him, since his name helps affirm the SSI. He is worried about the philosophy in the book which begins &quot;Thought is a primitive suspicion. Reason is an irrational idea.&quot; After some time Dr. Stadler screams to himself that &quot;I had nothing to do with it!&quot;
**Dr. Ferris arrives one hour late because his car broke down and he &quot;had a hell of a time trying to find someone to fix it.&quot; They briefly talk of the trouble with reclaiming the Wyatt oil fields - the scientists cannot discover the special method Wyatt used. Dr. Ferris had yet to reclaim one drop but has received many large grants from the government. Moreover, he gauges the project's success based on approval from certain incumbents, rather than actual results. Dr. Stadler attempts to ask for actual results, but Ferris tells him he's not interested in practical technological endeavors. Stadler then complains of the lack of heating due to the oil shortage.  Dr. Stadler then asks about Project Xylophone or Project X. Ferris informs him that it is a top secret project that has to do with sound. Stadler then presses Ferris on the book. Ferris is flustered and asks &quot;did you find the text confusing?&quot; Stadler warns of the dangerous message of the book and Ferris shrugs it off. Ferris claims the audience is one that does not want to think and thus will not be troubled by the content. He believes the audience will embrace the books for giving them justification for not thinking.
**Dr. Stadler lets Ferris leave without saying he will denounce the book in public. He fears this threat would not faze Ferris. He begins to feel that his word no longer had any power. 
**His secretary informs him that Dagny is on the line. She asks him to meet with her in New York, and although he does not have an engagement there, he lies so that he can meet her today. He leaves as soon as he can, desperate for another mind of like competence.

**Excerpts from Why Do You Think You Think by Dr. Floyd Ferris
***&quot; &quot;Thought is a primitive superstition. Reason is an irrational idea.&quot; (316)
***&quot;The more we know, the more we learn that we know nothing&quot; (316)
***&quot;Do not expect consistancy. Everything is a contradiction of everything else. Nothing exists but contradictions.&quot; (317)
***&quot;You cannot be sure of anything&quot; (317)
**&quot;You see, Dr. Stadler, people don't want to think. And the deeper they get into trouble, the less they want to think. But by some sort of instinct, they feel that they ought to and it makes them feel guilty. So they'll bless and follow anyone who gives them a justification for not thinking. Anyone who makes a virtue—a highly intellectual virtue—out of what they know to be their sin, their weakness and their guilt.&quot; (264)

===Section 212: Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 2===

*'''Plot summary'''
** While at work, Dagny reminisces the recent events -- the dying companies, and Jim's triumph. Hammonds and Stockton have disappeared, and Dagny has no longer become astonished at this steady disappearance of the producers. Through his friends in Washington, Jim has managed to make all the restrictive legislatures favor Taggart Transcontinental, in some way, usually through forced elimination of competition. Jim has thus grafted large sums of money, &quot;Listed as profit, on the glossy pages of his report to the stockholders, was the money he had not earned--the subsidies for empty trains; and the money he did not own--the sum that should have gone to pay the interest and the retirement of Taggart bonds, the debt which, by the will of Wesley Mouch, he had been permitted not to pay. (327)&quot; He proclaims to Dagny, &quot;'You have always considered money-making as such an important virtue... well, it seems to me that I'm better at it than you are (327).&quot;
** In her conversation with Stadler, Dagny almost finds herself sympathizing with Stadler when he offers a potential scientist to take on the quest of reconstructing the motor. This type, as Stadler admits himself, is the type who would refuse to work for the State Science Institute. The small talk of incompetent railway workers broaches up the rhetorical question, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; Stadler mentions that he knew of a John Galt once, &quot;He had such a mind that, had he lived, the whole world would have been talking of him by now (334).&quot; Ominously, Stadler declares that this John Galt must be dead, he ''has to'' -- even though he appears to be lonely for a like mind.

===Section 213: Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 3===

*'''Plot summary'''
**Rearden receives a mysterious order from the State Science Institute demanding that he sell 10,000 tons of Rearden Metal for a certain Project X. Recent legislation has required that he limit sales to any one customer only 500 tons -- which is clearly an arbitrary sum set by some clueless incumbent, since it's barely enough to lay 3 miles of Taggart rail. Rearden refuses to sell to the State Science Institute. 
** The Wet Nurse, a representative from Washington hired to monitor Rearden's progress, advises Rearden to reconsider, because the source is the government, and that there will be trouble if he rejects it. 
** When a representative of the State Science Institute comes to discuss the issue with Rearden, Rearden states that because it's his creation, he has a moral right to know what use is made of his metal -- regardless of the fact that just a short while ago, the State Science Institute had issued libel against Rearden Metal. The spokesman invokes a bunch of words, stating that it's a great project of great social value, but does not actually state what Project X is. Rearden then gives him the ultimatum -- if you want the metal, just go out and take it like any looter. He can't shoot him, but he will not help make this extortion look moral and legal. The spokesman leaves, ominously stating that he will regret his action. Rearden, however, feels elated. His reaction is a step closer to understanding of his role in the Sanction of the Victim.

*'''Plot summary'''
**Rearden buys Dagny a bunch of expensive luxury items, some of which he can't afford, in hopes of turning her into his own luxury item. Dagny claims the ownership is righteous because he has bought her long ago through his ability and achievement. (This ritual of courtship through merit is typical in Ayn Rand's romances.) Hank admits that he'd never had a reason for spending the money he'd earned -- he'd always envisioned that he'd buy treasures for a woman, but has not found her until now. 
**Dagny tells Rearden of Quentin Daniels and the possibility of finding a mind to revive the motor. She mentions Stadler, and Rearden tells her that Stadler wanted from Dagny a recognition that he's still great, &quot;to juggle reality for him, so that his greatness would remain. (350)&quot;

==CHAPTER TWO: The Aristocracy of Pull==

===Section 221: Part 2, Chapter 2, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
** Within view of the giant citywide calendar across the street, Dagny reminisces recent events in her office in New York. The giant calendar is a looming presence that haunts her with the thought that her days are limited, and that she's working towards an end it knows, but she does not know. 
** She remembers her meeting with Quintin Daniels, the scientist Stadler suggested to her who might remake the motor. Daniels had refused to work at the State Science Institute on the basis that &quot;Governmental scientific inquiry&quot; is a contradiction in terms. Instead, Daniels works as a night watchman at the Utah Institute of Technology. The low pay is sufficient to pay for his meals, and he has full access to the labs; cut off from the world, he is doing research for his own personal enjoyment. He had refused Dagny's high monthy pay, stating that he would gamble with his own mind and not with her money, uncertain about whether he will succeed in reconstructing the motor. However, when and if he succeeds, he will demand a high percentage of the profits. Daniels' method of payment is both ideally [[w:Objectivism|Objective]] and a tribute to the meaning and worth of money, which is clarified later in this chapter by Francisco's speech at Taggart's wedding. 
** As Dagny leaves the building, the cigarette-collecting old man at the cigar stand stops her, telling her that he'd looked everywhere to try to find the manufacturer of the cigarette with the sign of the dollar she had given him -- though the cigarette is definitely machine made, to the best of his knowledge, &quot;that cigarette was not made anywhere on earth.&quot;

*'''Plot summary:'''
** Rearden sits in his room in the Wayne-Falkland Hotel reminiscing his secret meeting with Dannager. He had arranged to give Dannagar enough Rearden Metal to reinforce the roofing of Dannagar's mines from caving in. Dannager is one of the only competent men remaining, and Rearden feels this underhand action is a blow against the looters. Yet, he feels contempt for himself that he is reduced to having to pull a secret meeting for an honest trade.
** After the waiter has cleared away the in-room dinner cart, Lillian bursts into the room. Rearden is surprised at her appearance. Though he does not want to attend the party, Lillian convinces Rearden to attend Taggart's wedding. The fact that she has convinced him to go to the party means that she still holds him as a [[w:Atlas_Shrugged#Sanction_of_the_Victim|victim]].

*'''Plot summary:'''
** Cherryl reminisces while she dresses for her wedding under the supervision of a sob sister who had taken Brooks under her protection. Masses of reporters have tailed after Brooks, shooting pictures of her in her slum neighborhood, making Brooks something of a sensation, though to her chagrin. Brooks senses something wrong in the sort of publicity she's receiving -- indeed, Taggart had not only not offered her money to escape the reporters, he had also not hired her an escort to take her to the wedding. The sobsister would be the one to drive Brooks to her wedding.
** Cherryl also recounts her &quot;romance&quot; with Taggart. She had been surprised that Taggart had dropped by her slum room one day, out of the blue. Taggart seems to find in her an unlikely confidante; he spills out his animosity towards his contemporaries, both heroes and looters, while Brooks, understanding little of what he rambles about, innocently assumes the burden of listening to his words. Taggart is drawn to Brooks by her innocence, her hero-worshipping ideals; he feels like he's winning  by making Brooks believe that he is the hero, and Dagny and Rearden the villains.
** The sob sister warns her that &quot;there are people who'll try to hurt you through the good they see in you--knowing that it's the good, needing it and punishing you for it. Don't let it break you when you discover that. (364)&quot; Rather than taking heed from the sobsister's words, Brooks is optimistic that she'd soon be Mrs. James Taggart.

** The section on Cherryl and Jim Taggart's wedding. Jim has received media attention for his democratic wedding--that his bride is one of the poor.
** Bertran Scudder states that &quot;Money is the root of all evil&quot;. To which d'Anconia gives a lengthy rebuttal. 
** Lillian asks Dagny for the bracelet back, but Dagny refuses to return it. Lillian attempts to get Dagny to admit that she's having an affair with Rearden, yet when Dagny gets to the point, Lillian realizes how ludicrous the speculation is. Taking Dagny's side, Rearden asks Lillian to apologize to Dagny.
** In Francisco's speech, he asserts that &quot;money is the root of all good.&quot; Those who believe it is evil have let money be its own value, when the value of money is dependent on its creator and trader. This value can be deprecated into something evil if money is abused through fraudulent trade.
** The party ends when Francisco states to Rearden that he has instigated the crash of D'Anconia Copper Stock, and the party guest leave in a hurry to try and talk to their respective stockbrokers.

==CHAPTER THREE: White Blackmail==

===Section 231: Part 2, Chapter 3, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Rearden returns to his hotel room in the Wayne-Falkland Hotel after Taggart's party. Lillian announces that she's going to take a train home and complains that she hates d'Anconia, that he could have kept his mouth shut until tomorrow morning, that &quot;he owed a certain duty to his stockholders, didn't he? (392)&quot; The tension in her voice is revealed in a later section.
**Rearden escorts Lillian by taxi to the train station, still dressed in his evening clothes.
**Rearden gives the taxi driver the address of Dagny's apartment, and he goes there immediately after dropping Lillian off.
**At Dagny's apartment, Dagny explains the nature of their love for one another--that it is like a mutual trade. In accords with [[w:Atlas_Shrugged#Theory_of_sex|Ayn Rand's Theory of Sex]], Dagny tells Rearden that that her &quot;way of trading is to know that the joy [he] gives [her] is paid for by the joy [he] gets from [her]--not by [his] suffering or [hers]. (394)&quot; She won't accept sacrifices, and if he asks her to give up her railroad, she'd leave him. She tells him that if the pleasure of one is bought by the pain of the other, then the trade is a fraud. She warns him that, &quot;You don't do it in business, Hank. Don't do it in your own life. (394)&quot; Dagny's words remind Rearden of how different she and Lillian are. 
**Rearden asks Dagny who had been her first lover. Dagny refuses to answer, in part because of Rearden's motive in asking, and instead prompts Rearden to understand his error in envy over her first man, &quot;Do you know your only real guilt? With the greatest capacity for it, you've never learned to enjoy yourself. You've always rejected your own pleasure too easily. You've been willing to bear too much. (395)&quot; Ironically, Rearden mentions that that's exactly what Francisco told him at the party. Dagny asks Rearden what he thinks of Francisco, and Rearden admits that he's the one man to whom he'd entrust his life.
**Rearden apologizes for the insults he threw at Dagny, the morning after at Wyatt's house.

He fears what will happen if Ken Dannager quits and abandones his business, because while Rearden can take it, Dannager is barely hanging by a thread; Dagny has recognized that he is &quot;ready for the destroyer&quot; and a small push might set him off and make him quit.  He also mentions that Dagny wishes she knew who the destroyer was, so that she could kill him, even if it meant she had to die in the process.

**Dagny goes to Pittsburgh to try to see Ken Dannager and prevent him from quitting.  
**There is an unannounced visitor already in the office with Mr. Dannager, who is causing his appointment with her to run late.  This is extremely unusual for Dannager, who is as punctual as a train schedule.
**Dagny is admitted to Dannager's office, only to find that the visitor ahead of her was The Destroyer, who has convinced Dannager to quit.  Dagny tries to beg Dannager not to quit, but is unsuccessful, and he will be leaving that day.  Dannager asks Dagny to tell Hank Rearden that he is probably &quot;the only man I ever loved,&quot; indicating how much he cared about Rearden.
**Dannager tells her not to worry, as she'll be seeing him again soon.  &quot;Oh?  Are you going to return?&quot;  &quot;No.  You're going to join me.&quot;

===Section 235: Part 2, Chapter 3, Section 5===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Rearden is sitting in his office thinking about how badly he feels that his friend Ken Dannager has quit.  Dagny's mention to him of Dannager's admission of how much of a friend Rearden was to him has made him realize how much he will miss Dannager. 
**As Rearden prepares to leave the office, he discovers Francisco d'Anconia waiting outside.  Francisco talks to him about whether his actions in making metal or running his business have given him any benefits, or is he simply being punished for his good qualities, and whether any one should continue under the circumstances.  &quot;Mr. Rearden, if you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders&amp;mdash;what would you tell him to do?&quot;  &quot;I... don't know.  What... could he do?  what would ''you'' tell him?&quot; &quot;To shrug.&quot;
**As Francisco tries to speak to Rearden about the nature of his burdens and ask him a question, an alarm sounds as a break-out has occurred at one of the furnaces.  Rearden and Francisco both run out to the furnace, and both begin acting to stop the furnace from overflowing.
**While responding to the break-out, Rearden saves Francisco's life as he almost slips and falls into a pool of molten metal.
**After the crisis is over, Rearden suggests Francisco come work for him in order to appreciate the business he has inherited.  Francisco admits he wishes he could, but he can't.  Rearden asks him to tell him the question he was going to ask.  Francisco admits that it's pointless to ask the question, he already knows the answer.

==CHAPTER FOUR: The Sanction of the Victim==

===Section 241: Part 2, Chapter 4, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Rearden's family prepares to celebrate Thanksgiving, but are unhappy that he might end up going to jail over the illegal sale of metal that he and Ken Dannager were indicted over, instead of cooperating with the government.
**Rearden listens to Lillian's condemnation of him, and realizes what she is stating represents a monstrous system where one's own goodwill is used for one's very destruction.
**Lillian says they know what he is thinking, and that's why they are cracking down on him.  He says they don't, and he's going to tell them at his trial.  Phillip criticises Rearden's attitude, saying he thinks he's guilty as hell and finds it contemptible.  Rearden tells him if he talks that way to him again in his house he will throw Phillip out on the street.
**Rearden, disgusted with his family, walks out to go to New York.
**Rearden remembers how the Wet Nurse knew about his deal with Dannager, but never told anyone about it.  
**Rearden goes to Dagny's Apartment in New York, but discovers she's at her office. Rearden goes there and meets Eddie, who tells Rearden that his trial is something he doesn't believe in and even if it's done in the name of the people, he's not one of the people that is represented.  Dagny tells Rearden that if he's sent to jail she'll quit, without any destroyer coming to see her.  Rearden does not think that will happen, and informs Dagny that for the sixty thousand tons of steel they ordered, he is actually going to deliver eighty thousand tons of Rearden Metal, and if anyone finds out, he will make it look like he is the only one to blame, and he doesn't want her to ever admit she knows about it.

===Section 242: Part 2, Chapter 4, Section 2===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Hank Rearden appears for his trial for illegally selling Rearden Metal.  He is asked to enter a plea in his own defense.  He admits he has no defense because he does not recognize the court's right to try him, as he is not before a tribunal of justice, but, in effect, a kangaroo court, and will not allow them to disguise what they are.  They can rule in whatever fashion they please, since he has no rights and no ability to defend himself, but he will not co-operate in their actions.  If they want him to go to jail, they will have to send armed men to carry him; if they want to impose fines upon him, they will have to seize his property themselves, he will not pay it.  He has done nothing but act honorably in his business, and he will neither accept sacrifices from others nor be sacrificed for others, or be a victim.  &quot;If it is now the belief of my fellow men, who call themselves the public, that their good requires victims, then I say: The public good be damned, I will have no part of it!&quot;  The audience in the courtroom cheers.
**The judges are overwhelmed by Rearden's stand, and choose to fine him $5,000 and suspend sentence.  The audience in the courtroom laughs at them.  
**Rearden tries to understand why people had allowed themselves to accept the doctrines of self-destruction such as what the court had effectively been a part of, and that is the real sentence imposed upon him, to learn why.

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Dagny admits to Rearden as a result of the decision in his trial that she will never doubt that right wins in the end.  Lillian chides Rearden over his stand in the trial.
**The Wet nurse asks Rearden a question about his speech: &quot;What's a moral premise?&quot;  &quot;Something you're going to have a lot of trouble with.&quot;  Rearden discovers that his fellow businessmen are unwilling to refuse to be victims, or to stand up for themselves, despite the results that occurred in his own case.  
**Rearden sits in his hotel room, wanting to see Francisco, then realizes he could simply go see him in his suite in the same hotel.  Rearden does so, and discovered Francisco had been listening to Rearden's trial over the radio.  Rearden admits he does not understand why someone with the intelligence and the ability of Francisco has chosen to live as a womanizing wastrel playboy.
**Francisco introduces Rearden to the value theory of sex, that only a neurotic man chases worthless women, and since he isn't a neurotic, it's another reason: to camouflage his actions for a secret purpose of his own.
**Rearden admits that since Francisco has told him a secret, he will tell him one: Rearden has secretly ordered copper from d'Anconia copper in order to fill the order for Taggart Transcontinental's rail, an order that is ten times the size of the one he was indicted for.
**Francisco is furious, reminding Rearden that he had told him never to deal with d'Anconia Copper.  Francisco reaches to use a telephone, but stops himself.  Rearden realizes there is something Francisco has the power to prevent, but it is a power he will not use.  Pained, Francisco swears to Rearden that despite what he is going to find out, he is still Rearden's friend.
**Rearden is informed he will not be receiving the copper, because Ragnar Danneskjold has sunk the d'Anconia ore freighters.
**Rearden later realizes he must stay away from Francisco, lest he kill him on sight.

**Dagny is at a Taggert Board Meeting. A Mr. Weatherby from the government is there, although his role is unclear. Taggert Transcontinental is becoming a financial disaster.

Dagny responds that she can't make the company profitable any longer.  The Board must close one of the lines in order to use track from one to repair another.

==CHAPTER SIX: The Concerto of Deliverance==

===Section 361: Part 3, Chapter 6, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**Hank finds out that the Steel Workers Union went to the Unificiation Board to demand a raise, and was denied. The mood in the mill becomes tense and there are some minor altercations. Hank finds it odd that he has had no part in any of this.
**Hank is informed that there was a hearing about a tax issue, that he was found guilty, and that all his assets are frozen. He decides to do nothing. Then he is informed that it was all a mistake and will be rectified, although it will take a little time. He is asked to go to New York the evening of Nov 4th, which he agrees to. He knows there is a trap in all that has been happening, but does not yet see it.
**His mother calls and asks to see him, insists that he come before going to New York. When he gets there, he finds that his mother has had Lillian living there as well. They beg him for money, he says he doesn't presently have any. He realizes that they hate him and want to destroy him. They let slip that they are worried that he will drop out. He realizes that Lillian only married him in order to try and break him, to corrupt him. They all want him to take care of them and try to use guilt and scorn to motivate him. But he realizes that they have just been using him, and tells them that he no longer cares about any of them, or what happens to them, and leaves.
**In New York, he sees the Washington gang, who try to flatter him. They reveal their intentions for a Steel Unification Plan. Basically, they want him to hand over his profits to Orren Boyle, to run his mill at a loss and to put the last of his wealth into the mill. They want what he has left, and do not think beyond the present to the time when Hank will be broke. They just assume that Hank will figure something out, that he will save them all. Hank leaves.
**On the way home, he comes to the mill. He finds a staged riot in progress. It was supposed to happen while he was still in New York, except that Hank left earlier than planned. The Washington gang wanted it to look like his workers were very unhappy and mistreated. But his workers defended the mill in an armed battle. One of Hank's furnace supervisors saw what was coming, got the workers ready and directed the battle. The Wet Nurse was part of the gang's plan but wouldn't go along so they shot him. As Hank tried to enter the mill via a back way, he finds The Wet Nurse, who has finally figured things out just as he is dying in Hank's arms. Hank enters the mill and is attacked by some stray thugs but is saved. It was the furnace supervisor who saved Hank, and who turns out to be Francisco. Hank is finally ready to hear what Francisco has to say.

==CHAPTER SEVEN: &quot;This is John Galt Speaking&quot;==

===Section 371: Part 3, Chapter 7, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**In a panic, Jim wakes Dagny at her apartment to tell her that Hank is gone, as are the top people at his mill. And the news is out. Dagny notes that people notice his absence more than they ever noticed his achievements. Businesses that rely on steel in turn start going out of business. Some of those people commit suicide.
**Dagny gets a note from Hank, he has met John Galt, is aware that Dagny now loves John, and is ok with it.
**She knows Galt works at Taggart Terminal but resists seeking him out.
**Through railroad reports, Dagny is aware of escalating lawlessness around the country, new not mentioned in the papers.
**The radio announces an important speech by Mr. Thompson to be on Nov 22, in a week.The speech is widely publicized.
**Jim asks Dagny to come see Thompson at the studio, but promises he isn't trying to get her to participate and endorse the speech. At the studio, every main character is there. Jim had lied to her, they wanted her to join the discussion all along. But she refuses.
**The head technician tells them they can't broadcast, some strange transmission is blocking and overpowering theirs, country side. At 8pm, instead of Thompson, John Galt speaks. The remainder of the section is his speech:
- - - - 
**&quot;I have deprived you of victims, and thus destroyed your world.&quot; I will tell you why you are perishing, you who dread knowledge.
**You sacrificed justice to mercy, independence to unity, reason to faith, wealth to need, self esteem to self denial, happiness to duty.
**I have withdrawn those who live by the mind. I have stopped your motor, deprived your world of man's mind.
**We don't owe you, your need is no claim on us. We, the men of the mind, are on strike. On strike against self immolation, that life is guilt. You said we were evil, so we left. The battle has been whether your life belongs to god or to your neighbor. No one has told you that your life belongs to you.
**Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Plants and animals can't decide, they just live by instinct.
**Man has the power to act as his own destroyer, which is how he has acted through most of history.
**Your own life must be your motive and goal, otherwise you are an agent of death.
**Man's life is not the life of a mindless brute but of a thinking being. Not survival at any price since there is only one price that pars for man's survival: reason.
**A doctrine that gives you as an ideal, the role of sacrificial anima seeking slaughter on the alter of others is giving you death as a standard.
**Since life requires a specific course of action, any other course will destroy it.
**The purpose of morality is to teach you not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.
**Sweep aside those who preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as no value.
**If you choose not to think, you default on existence and pass along the deficit to some moral man expecting him to sacrifice his good for the sake of letting you survive by your evil.
**When a man declares &quot;Who am I to know&quot; he is declaring &quot;Who am I to live&quot;.
**You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality on a desert island - it is on a desert island that he would need it most. Let him there try to claim that a rock is a house, that sand is clothing, that food will leap into his mouth.
**Some paragraphs about
***Rationality
***Independence
***Integrity
***Justice
***Productiveness
***Pride
**The symbol of all relationships among such men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is THE TRADER.
**No man may INITIATE the use of physical force against others.
**I have no benefits to seek from human vices: from stupidity, dishonesty, or fear.
**Original Sin is supposed to be when man at of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.
**I am speaking to man the victim, not man the killer, the word that has destroyed you is sacrifice, the rejection of the good for the sake of the evil.
**They wish you to sacrifice materially but they also wish you to sacrifice your values.
**The mystics of spirit, the mystics of muscle
**A is A, the identity principle.
**They say, I want it, therefore it is.
**The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it too. The corrallary to causeless in matter is the unearned in spirit.
**Who pays for the orgy? Who causes the causeless? Who are the victims condemned to remain unacknowledged?
**WE are, we, the men of the mind.
**They proclaim that the only requirement for running a factory is the ability to turn the cranks of the machines, and blank out the question of who created the factory.
**They are taking you back to darker ages than any your history has known. The goal is not the era of pre-science, but the era of pre-language.
**Let the cannibal that snarls that the freedom of man's mind was needed to CREATE an industrial civilization, but is not needed to maintain it, be given an arrowhead and bearsking, not a university chair of economics.
**To a savage, the world is not the unknown, but the unknowable.
**He can count on nothing, he can only wish.
**They proclaim that every man born is entitled to exist without labor and is entitled to receive his minimum sustenance with no effort on his part, as his due &amp; birthright.
**Every man, they announce, owns an equal share of the technological benefits created in the world.
**Your gangs of mystics, of spirit and muscle, are fighting for power to rule you, you who have agreed to have no mind.
**Society - all of it is the same performance for the same &amp; only purpose: to reduce you to the kind of pulp that has surrendered the validity of your consciousness. But it cannot be done without your consent. If you permit it to be done, you deserve it.
**A mystic, afraid to think, is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings. He struggles to hide from himself that the nature of his feelings is terror. His lust is to command, not to convince.
**The forces let loose in your world today do not want to own your fortune, they want you to lose it. They do not want to succeed, they want you to fail. They keep running, trying not to learn that the object of his hatred is himself.
**Theirs is a conspiracy against the mind, against life and man.
**It is a conspiracy of those who seek, not to live, but to GET AWAY with living. The professor who, unable to think, cripples the minds of his students. The businessman who, to protect his stagnation, takes pleasure in chaining the ability of his competitors. The eunuch who takes pleasure in the castration of all pleasure.
**We are no longer there to save you from the effects of your chosen belief.
**You have been living on borrowed time - and I am the man who has called in the loan.
**Twelve years ago when I worked in your world, I discovered a source of energy available since the birth of the globe, but which men had not known how to use. I created a motor that would have made a fortune for me and those who hired me. Then one night at a factory meeting, I heard three parasites assert that my brain and my life were their property. That my right to exist was dependant upon satisfying their desires. I had no right to live by reason of my competency, their right to live was unconditional, by reason of their incompetence.
**Then I saw what was wrong with the world, and that the only weapon of evil was the willingness of good to serve it.
**I quit that factory and your world. I made it my job to warn your victims and to give them the method and the weapon to fight you.
**Ask yourself how much you have invented and how much you make of others inventions.
**When you clamor for public ownership of the means of production, you are clamoring for public ownership of the mind.
**Did you want to know who is John Galt? I am the first man of ability who refuses to regard it as guilt.
**I have done by plan and intention what has been done throughout history by silent default, gone on strike.
**The Dark Ages were an era of intelligence on strike.
**The road of human history was a string of blank-outs with only a few brief bursts of sunlight when the released energy of the men of the mind performed the wonders you gaped at, admired, and then promptly extinguished.
**I have foreshortened the usual course of history and have let you discover the nature of the payments you had hoped to switch to the shoulders of others. Do not pretend that a malevolent reality defeated you - you were defeated by your own evasions.
**But to those of you who still retain a love of your life I offer a chance to make a choice - be &quot;moral&quot; or live.
**pg 965 - mentions he has spoken for two hours.
**But the price is to start from scratch, reversing a costly historical error, to declare, &quot;I am, therefore I'll think.&quot;
**The three of us, Francisco, Ragnar, and myself started this and I am completing it. We resolved to avenge this country that was built on MY morality, but you failed to live up to it.
**We will not return until the road is clear to rebuild this country, until the wreckage of the morality of sacrifice has been wiped out of our way.
**The source of man's right is the law of identity.
**No right can exist without the right to translate one's rights into reality, which means, the right of property.
**The only proper functions of government are the police, the army, and the courts.
**Look past the moment, you who fear to compete with men of superior intelligence. When you live in a society where men are free to trade the value of your work is determined not only by your effort but by the effort of the best productive minds around you.
**When you work in a modern factory you are paid not only for your labor, but for all the productive genius which has made that factory possible (industrialist, investor, inventor, engineer, scientist).
**It is the value of his time that the strong of intellect transfers to the weak.
**Material products can't be shared, it is only the value of an idea that can be shared with unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one's sacrifice or loss, raising the productive capacity of labor.
**In proportion to mental energy spent, the inventor receives a small percentage of the value he created no matter what his material payment. But a janitor receives an enormous payment in proportion to his mental effort.
**We dragged you out of your hovels but you called our palaces and yachts unfair.
**We asked to deal with your minds, you chose to deal using your gun. Our answer was &quot;May you be damned&quot;.
**Some of you might please ignorance. But the guiltiest among you are those who had the CAPACITY to know. The intellects who create weapons are the unforgivable (Dr. Stadler).
**To those who love life and the mind, I urge you to go on strike as I did.
**If you have to stay among them, keep your inventions to yourself, as a captive should. If you have a chance to vanish into a wilderness beyond their reach, do so. We will return after the collapse, of the morality of sacrifice. Our city will act as a rallying point for such hidden refuges as you create.
**The dollar sign will be our symbol.
**In the name of the best within us....
**My last words are to those heroes who still are held prisoner by their virtues and desperate courage. They hold you by your innocence, which gives them the benefit of the doubt (Dagny)
**You can win this new world, by a total break with the old. His oath is &quot;I swear - by my life and my love of it - that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine&quot;

==CHAPTER EIGHT: The Egoist==

===Section 381: Part 3, Chapter 8, Section 1===

*'''Plot summary:'''
**The Washington group talk about Galt's speech, flustered. Fred Kinnon finally brings up the food crisis, but the group has no solution. Dagny tells them that they have no answers but John Galt does, so they should step aside and let John Galt take charge.
**Thompson realizes she is right but rather than give up power he thinks to himself that he can coopt Galt. Dagny leaves with Eddie Willers. Thompson resolves to find Galt and make him solve the problem. They set a tail on Dagny so she'll lead them to him.
**Alone now, Eddie tells Dagny that he realized that he's known John Galt for years as a common track worker at the Taggart Company. Dagny tells him that if he doesn't want Galt destroyed that he is to forget ever knowing him, never to tell anyone.
**All around the country, the &quot;better men&quot; are now starting to &quot;drop out&quot; as a result of the impending food crisis and John Galt's speech. They are heading off into isolated &amp; unpopulated areas of the country.
**Nobody qualified can be found to fill meaningful, important positions. People turn down raises and promotions rather than take a position of responsiblity. The country starts to fall apart. Inflation takes hold.
**Thompson goes on the radio to send a message to John Galt that they will negotiate, that they will do whatever he says.
**With Hank having dropped out, Reardon Steel is taken over by the government, but the mill is closed after several months of mismanagement culminating in a fire.
**Feb 3 is the last date mentioned in this decline (in a passage about a pilot who sees no flame from Reardon Steel).
**Thompson tells Dagny to contact Galt and to tell him that Thompson wants to negotiate. He also says that Ferris and others are trying to find Galt in order to kill him, and perhaps have already killed him. He frightens her into contacting Galt.

*'''Plot summary:'''
** Dagny doesn't have a way to contact John Galt, but thinks she can find him. While working at the Taggart company, he had given a home address. She goes there and finds that he is in fact there. They spend a little time together. He shows her his laboratory hidden in the apartment, including the static electricity motor.
**He warns her that she has been followed and that they are coming to take him. He urges her that when they come she should act as though she was tracking him down to turn him in, that she is on their side. They come, and she does. They force their way into his laboratory, but he has booby-trapped it and everything inside is dust before they can gain entrance.

They are trying to tempt him with what they themselves would want as a bribe (The dinner held in his honor, the power). Mouch makes a speech promising contradictory things. The plan to lower taxes but raise government spending. The rich get to keep everything they have but the poor get more. Higher wages but lower prices.
**When the TV camera goes to Galt, Galt dodges away from the man holding a gun to his back so that the gun is apparent to the camera, thus showing that the leaders have been lying, that he isn't cooperating, and there is no John Galt Plan.  Galt then says to the camera &quot;Get the hell out of my way!&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Hello World - Writing, Compiling and Running a C++ Program ===
Below is an example of a simple C++ program:
{{:C++ Programming/Examples/Hello World}}

When you write a program you use a development environment. Your development environment can be a basic text editor or a feature rich C++ integrated development environment (IDE). You should not use a word processor like Microsoft Word, because it adds formatting codes to the text. 

If a compiler is not already available to you, see the [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Where to get|Where to get a compiler Section]] of the book. 

Open your development environment and type the program shown (or copy and paste it) and save it as '''hello.cc'''.

Now compile it using the C++ compiler:

 COMMAND_PROMPT&gt; ''g++ hello.cc -o hello''

The example uses GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection ( http://gcc.gnu.org ) but you could use any other compiler, or use an IDE to compile it. The above command would produce an executable called '''hello''' or '''hello.exe'''. Invoke the executable to run your first C++ program:

''Unix:''
 COMMAND_PROMPT&gt; ''./hello''
 '''Hello World!'''
 COMMAND_PROMPT&gt;

''Microsoft Windows:''
 COMMAND_PROMPT&gt; ''hello''
 '''Hello World!'''
 COMMAND_PROMPT&gt;

Text that is ''italicized'' is typed by you and the '''bold''' text is output by the program. If you use an [[w:Integrated development environment|IDE]], it might automatically color the code for you based on the syntax.

==== Troubleshooting ====
;g++: command not found
You don't have the GNU C++ compiler installed.  If you have a different compiler, check it's documentation for the correct compilation command.  

{{NOTE|There is detailed information on how to get a compiler and how to install it on the [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Where to get|Where to get a compiler Section]].&lt;br&gt;In [[C++ Programming/Weblinks#Compilers and IDEs|Appendix B:External References]] you will also find references to other freely available compilers and even full IDEs you can use.}}

;Wrong Compiler Command
Lot of weird errors, mentioning many times:

 undefined reference to `std::basic_ostream' [..]

Usually ending with:

 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

To use &lt;tt&gt;g++&lt;/tt&gt; to compile your hello.cc use:

 ''g++ hello.cc -o hello''

For &lt;tt&gt;gcc&lt;/tt&gt; use:

 ''gcc hello.cc -o hello -lstdc++

{{NOTE|For simplicity we assume that the file is in the path you are using...}}

;hello: command not found
You did not type the full path, try:

 ''./hello''

Is there a &lt;tt&gt;hello&lt;/tt&gt; program in this directory? Can you see it when you type &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt;? If not, your compilation (&lt;tt&gt;g++ hello.cc -o hello&lt;/tt&gt;) failed or you have changed to a wrong directory.

If you do not specify &lt;tt&gt;-o hello&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g++&lt;/tt&gt; names the output file &lt;tt&gt;a.out&lt;/tt&gt; ([[w:assembler|assembler]] output) for historical reasons. In such a case, type:

 ''./a.out''

to execute the program.

=== Your First C++ Program Explained ===
==== The preprocessing directive ====
Some features of C++ are part of the language and some others are part of a '''standard library'''. The standard library is a body of code that is available with every C++ compiler that is standards compliant. When the C++ compiler compiles your program it usually also links it with the standard C++ library.

When you use features from the library, C++ requires you to ''declare'' the features you will be using. The first line in the program is a '''preprocessing directive'''. In our example it is shown bold and italicized:

; The preprocessing Directive for IOStreams
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This line causes the C++ declarations which are in the &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt; ''header'' to be included for use in your program. Usually the compiler inserts the contents of a '''header file''' called &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt; into the program. Where it puts it depends on the system. The location of such files may be described in your compiler's documentation. A list of standard C++ header files is in [[C++ Programming/Standard Headers|the standard headers reference tables]].

The &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt; header contains various declarations for input/output (I/O). It uses an abstraction of I/O mechanisms called '''streams'''. For example there is an output stream object called &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt; which is used to output text to the standard output. Usually, this displays the text on the computer screen.

The ''preprocessor'' is a part of the compiler which does some transformations to your code before the ''actual'' compiler sees it. For example, on encountering a &lt;tt&gt;#include &lt;iostream&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; directive, it replaces the directive with the contents of the &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt; header file.

==== &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; Function ====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main()
{
    // ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The lines above represent a block of C++ code, given the name &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;. Such a named block of code is called a '''function''' in C++ parlance. The contents of the block are called the ''body'' of the function.

The word &lt;tt&gt;'''int'''&lt;/tt&gt; is shown in bold because it is a '''keyword'''. C++ keywords have some special meaning and are also '''reserved words''', i.e., cannot be used for any purpose other than what they are meant for. On the other hand &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; is not a keyword and you can use it in many places where a keyword cannot be used (though that is not recommended, as confusion could result).

Every (standards-compliant) C++ program must define a function called &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;. This is where the execution of the program begins. As we shall see &lt;!--TODO add link to a section in a page --&gt;later, &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; may ''call'' other functions which may call yet other functions. The compiler arranges for &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function to be called when the program begins executing. (Although this is generally true, it is not always true. There is an exception to &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;'s being executed at the very beginning that we will see later.)

Now let us look at the code inside the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function.

==== Printing Hello World! ====
The first line in &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; uses the &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt; object to print the ''string'' (sequence of characters) &lt;tt&gt;Hello World!&lt;/tt&gt; and end the line:

 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;

This line is a '''C++ statement'''. C++ statements are terminated by a semicolon (&lt;tt&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt;). Within the statement &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, called the ''insertion operator'' is used to output the string using the &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt; stream. C++ strings are enclosed within double quotes (&lt;tt&gt;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;). The quotes themselves are not part of the string and hence not printed. The sequence &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; is used within a string to indicate the end of the current line. Though the sequence is represented by two characters, it takes up only one character's worth of memory space. Hence the sequence &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt; is called the newline character. The actual procedure to start a new line is system-dependent but that is handled by the C++ standard library transparent to you.

{{NOTE|C Programmers should not confuse the insertion operator with the bitwise shift operator in C. C++ has a feature called ''operator overloading'' which allows the two interpretations of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; to coexist.  In C++, I/O is the primary use of &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, and bit shifting is a relatively uncommon use.}}

=== Modifications to the Above Program ===
Here is the same program with minor modifications:

{{:C++ Programming/Examples/Displays a string}}

==== Comments ====
The line added at the beginning:

 ''// This program justs displays a string and exits''

is a comment that tries to explain what the code does. Comments are essential to any non-trivial program so a person who is reading the code can understand what it is expected to do. There is no restriction to what is contained between the comment delimiters. The compiler just ignores all that is there in the comment. Comments are shown italicized in our examples. C++ supports two forms of comments:

* Single line comments start with a &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt; and extend upto the end of the line. These can also be used to the right of statements to explain what that statement does.

* Multi-line comments start with a &lt;tt&gt;/*&lt;/tt&gt; sequence and end with a &lt;tt&gt;*/&lt;/tt&gt; sequence. These can be used for comments spanning multiple lines. These are also known as C-style comments as this is the only type of comments available in C. e.g.:
 ''/* This program displays a string''
 ''   and then it exits */''

Comments are also used at times to enclose code that we temporarily want the compiler to ignore, but intend to use later. This is useful in '''debugging''', the process of finding out '''bugs''', or errors in the program. If a program does not give the intended result, by &quot;commenting out&quot; code, it might be possible to track which particular statement has a bug. As C-style comments can stop before the end of the line, these can be used to &quot;comment out&quot; a small portion of code within a line in the program.

==== Flushing the Output Stream Buffer ====
Whenever you ''write'' (i.e., send any output) to an output stream, it does not immediately get written. It is first stored in memory and may actually get written any time in the future. This process is called ''buffering'' and the regions in memory used for storing temporary data like this are called ''buffers''. It is at times desirable to ''flush'' the output stream buffers to ensure all data has been written. This is achieved by applying the insertion operator to an output stream and the object &lt;tt&gt;std::endl&lt;/tt&gt;. This is what is done by the line:

 std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl;

Before flushing the buffer, &lt;tt&gt;std:endl&lt;/tt&gt; also writes a newline character (which explains its name, '''end''' '''l'''ine). Hence the newline is omitted in the string printed in the previous line.

==== Returning Success Code ====
In most operating systems, every program is allowed to communicate to the invoker whether it finished execution successfully using a value called the '''exit status'''. As a convention, an exit status of 0 stands for success and any other value indicates failure. Different values for the exit status could be used to indicate different types of failures. In our simple program, we would like to exit with status 0.

C++ allows the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function to ''return'' an integer value, which is passed to the operating system as the exit status of the program. The statement:

 '''return''' 0;

makes &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; to return the value 0. Since the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function is required to return an ''integer'', the keyword &lt;tt&gt;'''int'''&lt;/tt&gt; is used to begin the function definition. This statement is optional since the compiler automatically generates code to return 0 for the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function for the cases where control ''falls off'' without a &lt;tt&gt;'''return'''&lt;/tt&gt; statement. This is why the first program worked without any return statements. Note that this is only a special case that applies only to the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function. For other &lt;!--TODO add link to a section in a page --&gt;functions you must return a value if they are declared to return anything.

'''Common Programming Error 1'''
Though the &lt;tt&gt;'''return'''&lt;/tt&gt; statement is optional, &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; should not be declared to return &lt;tt&gt;'''void'''&lt;/tt&gt; (a function declared as ''void'' is a function which does not return anything) as in some other languages like Java. Some C++ compilers may not complain about this, but it is wrong. Doing this could be equivalent to returning just about any random number that happened to be stored in a particular memory location or register, depending on the platform. This practice can also be potentially damaging to some operating systems, which rely on the return code to determine how to handle a crash or other abnormal exit.

==== Whitespace and Indentation ====
Spaces, tabs and newlines (line breaks) are usually called ''whitespace''. These are ignored by the compiler except within quotes, apart from the rule that preprocessing directives and C++-style comments end at a newline. So the above program could as well be written as follows:

{{:C++ Programming/Examples/Displays a string1}}

Note, however, that spaces are required to separate adjacent words and numbers.
To make the program more readable, whitespace must be used appropriately.

The conventions followed when using whitespace to improve the readability of code constitute an [[w:Indent style|Indent style]]. For example with alternate indent styles the program could be written like this:

{{:C++ Programming/Examples/Displays a string2}}

or like this:

{{:C++ Programming/Examples/Displays a string}}

==Variables==
=== Naming ===

# Can a variable name start with a number?
# Can a variable name start with a typographical symbol(e.g. #, *, _)?
# Give an example of a C variable name that would ''not'' work.  Why doesn't it work?

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
# No, the name of a variable must begin with a letter (lowercase or uppercase), or an underscore.
# Only the underscore can be used.
# for example, '''#nm*rt''' is not allowed because # and * are not the valid characters for the name of a variable.

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main()
{
    int a, b, c, max;
    clrscr();
    printf(&quot;\nenter three numbers &quot;);
    scanf(&quot;%d %d %d&quot;,&amp;a,&amp;b,&amp;c);
    max = a;
    if(max &lt; b)
        max = b;
    if(max &lt; c)
        max = c;
    printf(&quot;\nlargest=%d \n&quot;,max);
    getch();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

=== Data Types ===

# List at least three data types in C
## On your computer, how much memory does each require?
## Which ones can be used in place of another?  Why?
### Are there any limitations on these uses?
### If so, what are they?
### Is it necessary to do anything special to use the alternative?
# Can the name we use for a data type (e.g. 'int', 'float') be used as a variable?

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
* 3 data types : '''long int''', '''short int''','''float'''.
* On my computer :
** long int : 4 bytes
** short int : 2 bytes
** float : 4 bytes
* we can not use 'int' or 'float' as a variable's name.
}}

=== Assignment ===

# How would you assign the value 3.14 to a variable called pi?
# Is it possible to assign an ''int'' to a ''double''?  
## Is the reverse possible?

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
* The standard way of assigning 3.14 to pi is: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
double pi;
pi = 3.14;
&lt;/source&gt;
** Since pi is a constant, good programming convention dictates to make it unchangeable during runtime. Extra credit if you use one of the following two lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
const float pi = 3.14;
#define pi 3.14
&lt;/source&gt;
* Yes, for example :
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int a = 67;
double b;
b = a;
&lt;/source&gt;
* Yes, but a cast is necessary and the double is truncated:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
double a=89;
int b;
b = (int) a;
&lt;/source&gt;

}}

=== Referencing ===

# A common mistake for new students is reversing the assignment statement.  Suppose you want to assign the value stored in the variable &quot;pi&quot; to another variable, say &quot;pi2&quot;:
## What is the correct statement?
## What is the reverse?  Is this a valid C statement (even if it gives incorrect results)?
## What if you wanted to assign a constant value (like 3.1415) to &quot;pi2&quot;:  
##: '''a'''. What would the correct statement look like?
##: '''b'''. Would the reverse be a valid or invalid C statement?

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
# &lt;code&gt;pi2 = pi;&lt;/code&gt;
# The reverse, &lt;code&gt;pi = pi2;&lt;/code&gt; is a valid C statement if &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt; is not a constant and &lt;code&gt;pi2&lt;/code&gt; is initialized.
# '''a'''. &lt;code&gt;pi2 = 3.1415;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''b'''. The reverse: &lt;code&gt;3.1415 = pi2;&lt;/code&gt; is not valid since it is impossible to assign a value to a literal.

==Simple I/O==
&lt;pre&gt;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
  int a,b,c;
  a=2058;
  b=270;
  c=a^b;
  printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,c);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
=== String manipulation ===
1. Write a program that prompts the user for a string, and prints its reverse.
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
One possible solution could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(void)
{   
    char s[81]; // A string of upto 80 chars + '\0'
    int i;
    
    puts(&quot;Please write a string: &quot;);
    fgets(s, 81, stdin);

    puts(&quot;Your sentence in reverse: &quot;);
    for (i= strlen(s)-1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
    {
        if (s[i] == '\n')
            continue; // don't write newline
        else
            putchar(s[i]);
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
}}
2. Write a program that prompts the user for a sentence, and prints each word on its own line.
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=One possible solution could be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1 // Active C11 extended functions (this case is gets_s)
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int slen(const char *); // I don't want to include whole string lib just for get size

int main(void) {
  char s[500];
  printf(&quot;%s&quot;,&quot;Enter a sentence: &quot;);
  if(!gets_s(s,500)) {
    puts(&quot;Error!&quot;);
    getchar();
    return 0;
  }
  for(int i=0;i&lt;slen(s);i++)
    if(s[i]!=32)
      putchar(s[i]);
    else
      putchar(10);
  putchar(10);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

int slen(const char *s) {
  int i;
  for(i=0;s[i]!=0;i++);
  return i;
}

&lt;/source&gt;
}}

=== Loops ===
1. Write a function that outputs a right isosceles triangle of height and width ''n'', so ''n = 3'' would look like
&lt;pre&gt;
*
**
***
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
One possible solution:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;n);
  for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) {
    for(int j=0;j&lt;=i;j++)
      putchar(42);
    putchar(10);
  }
  while((n=getchar())!=10);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;
}} 
2. Write a function that outputs a sideways triangle of height ''2n-1'' and width ''n'', so the output for ''n = 4'' would be:
&lt;pre&gt;
*
**
***
****
***
**
*
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
One possible solution:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
// This is the fastest way
int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;n);
  for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) {
    for(int j=0;j&lt;=i;j++)
      putchar(42);
    putchar(10);
  }
  for(int i=n-1;i&gt;0;i--) {
    for(int j=0;j&lt;i;j++)
      putchar(42);
    putchar(10);
  }
  while((n=getchar())!=10);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

or like this (all math)

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void sideways(int n)
{
    int i=0,j=0;
    for(i=1;i&lt;2*n;i++){
        for(j=1;j&lt;=(n-(abs(n-i)));j++){
	    printf(&quot;*&quot;);
	}
	printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

}}

3. Write a function that outputs a right-side-up triangle of height ''n'' and width ''2n-1''; the output for ''n = 6'' would be:
&lt;pre&gt;
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
 *********
***********
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
One possible solution:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
void right_side_up(int n)
{
    int x,y;
    for (y= 1; y &lt;= n; y++)
    {
        for (x= 0; x &lt; n-y; x++)
            putchar(' ');
        for (x= (n-y); x &lt; (n-y)+(2*y-1); x++)
            putchar('*');
        putchar('\n');
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Another solution:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
  int n;
  scanf(&quot;%d&quot;,&amp;n);
  for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) {
    for(int j=0;j&lt;n-i-1;j++)
      putchar(32);
    for(int j=0;j&lt;i*2+1;j++)
      putchar(42);
    putchar(10);
  }
  while((n=getchar())!=10);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;
}}

==Program Flow==

1. Build a program where control passes from main to four different functions with 4 calls.

2. Now make a while loop in main with the function calls inside it. Ask for input at the beginning of the loop. End the while loop if the user hits Q

3. Next add conditionals to call the functions when the user enters numbers, so 1 goes to function1, 2 goes to function 2, etc.

4. Have function 1 call function a, which calls function b, which calls function c 

5. Draw out a diagram of program flow, with arrows to indicate where control goes

==Functions==

1. Write a function to check if an integer is negative; the declaration should look like
bool is_positive(int i);

2. Write a function to raise a floating point number to an integer power, so for example to when you use it

float a = raise_to_power(2, 3);    //a gets 8

float b = raise_to_power(9, 2);    //b gets 81

float raise_to_power(float f, int power);    //make this your declaration

==Math==

1. Write a function to calculate if a number is prime. Return 1 if it is prime and 0 if it is not a prime. 
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
One possible solution using a naïve [[w:primality test|primality test]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
// to compile: gcc -Wall prime.c -lm -o prime

#include &lt;math.h&gt;    // for the square root function sqrt()	
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int is_prime(int n);

int main() 
{
  printf(&quot;Write an integer: &quot;);
  int var;
  scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;var);
  if (is_prime(var)==1) {
    printf(&quot;A prime\n&quot;);
  } else {
    printf(&quot;Not a prime\n&quot;);
  }
  return 1;
}

int is_prime(int n)
{
  int x;
  int sq= sqrt(n)+1;
 
  // Checking the trivial cases first
  if ( n &lt; 2 )
    return 0;
  if ( n == 2 || n == 3 )
    return 1;
 
  // Checking if n is divisible by 2 or odd numbers between 3 and the
  // square root of n.
  if ( n % 2 == 0 )
    return 0;
  for (x= 3; x &lt;= sq; x += 2)
    {
      if ( n % x == 0 )
	return 0;
    }
 
  return 1; 
}

&lt;/source&gt;

Another better solution that doesn't need to include math.h and faster than the one above.

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

int isPrime(const unsigned long long int);

int main(void) {
  unsigned long long n;
  scanf(&quot;%llu&quot;,&amp;n);
  printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,isPrime(n));
  while((n=getchar())!=10);
  getchar();
  return 0;
}

int isPrime(const unsigned long long int x) {
  if(x&lt;4)
    return x&gt;1;
  if(x%2==0||x%3==0)
    return 0;
  for(unsigned long int i=5;i*i&lt;=x;i+=6)
    if(x%i==0||x%(i+2)==0)
      return 0;
  return 1;
}

&lt;/source&gt;
}}
2. Write a function to determine the number of prime numbers below n.

3. Write a function to find the square root by using Newton's method.

4. Write functions to evaluate the trigonometric functions:

5. Try to write a random number generator.

6. Write a function to determine the prime number between 2 and 100:

== Recursion ==
==== Merge sort ====
1. Write a C program to generate a random  integer array with a given length n ,  and sort it recursively using the Merge sort algorithm.
* The merge sort algorithm is a recursive algorithm .

- sorting a one element array is easy.

- sorting two  one-element arrays,  requires the merge operation. The merge operation looks at two sorted arrays as lists, and compares
the head of the list , and which ever head is smaller, this element is put on the sorted list and the head of that list is ticked off, so the
next element becomes the head of that list. This is done until one of the lists is exhausted, and the other list is then copied onto the end
of the sorted list.

- the recursion occurs, because merging two one-element arrays produces one two-element sorted array, which can be merged with another two-element
sorted array produced the same way. This produces a sorted 4 element array, and the same applies for another 4 element sorted array.

- so the basic merge sort, is to check the size of list to be sorted, and if it is greater than one, divide the array into two, and call merge sort again on the two halves. After wards, merge the two halves in a temporary space of equal size, and then copy back the final sorted array onto the original array.

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

==== Binary heaps ====
2.  '''Binary heaps''' :
* A binary max-heap or min-heap, is an ordered structure where some nodes are guaranteed greater than other nodes, e.g. the parent vs two children.  A binary heap can be stored in an array , where , 

- given a position '''i''' (the parent) , '''i*2''' is the left child, and '''i*2+1''' is the right child. 

- ( C arrays begin at position 0, but 0 * 2 = 0, and 0 *2 + 1= 1, which is incorrect , so start the heap at position 1, or add 1 for parent-to-child calculations, and subtract 1 for child-to-parent calculations ). 

* try to model this using with a pencil and paper, using 10 random unsorted numbers, and inserting each of them into a   &quot;heapsort&quot; array of 10 elements.

* To insert into a heap,  '''end-add''' and '''swap-parent''' if higher, until parent higher.

* To delete the top of a heap,   move   '''end-to-top''',  and  '''defer-higher-child''' or '''sift-down''' , until no child is higher. 

* try it on a pen and paper the numbers 10, 4, 6 ,3 ,5 , 11. 

{{Solution|title=pen-and-paper-solution|text=

* 10, 4, 6, 3, 5, 11  -&gt; 10
* 4, 6,3, 5, 11 -&gt;  10, 4  : 4 is end-added, no swap-parent because 4 &lt; 10.
* 6, 3, 5, 11 -&gt;   10, 4, 6  : 6 is end-added, no swap-parent because 6 &lt; 10.
* 3, 5, 11 -&gt; 10, 4, 6, 3 : 3 is end-added, 3 is position 4 , divide by 2 = 2, 4 at position 2, no swap-parent  because 4 &gt; 3.
* 5 , 11 -&gt; 10, 4, 6, 3 , 5 : 5 is end-added , 5 is position 5, divided by 2 = 2, 4 at position 2,  swap-parent as 4 &lt; 5; 5 at position 2, no swap-parent because 5 &lt; 10 at position 1. 

- 10 , 5, 6, 3, 4

* 11 -&gt; 10, 5, 6, 3, 4, 11 : 11 is end-added, 11 is position 6, divide by 2 = 3, swap 6 with 11, 11 is position 3, swap 11 with 10, stop as no parent.

- 11, 5, 10, 3, 4, 6  

- 11 has children 5, 10 ;  5 has children 3 and 4 ; 10 has child 6. Parent always &gt; child. 
 
}}

* the answer was 11, 5, 10, 3, 4 , 6.   

*EXERCISE:  Now try removing each top element of 11, 5, 10, 3, 4, 6  , using  end-to-top and sift-down ( or swap-higher-child) to get the numbers
in descending order. 

{{Solution|title=pen-and-paper-solution|text=
* 11 leaves  * , 5, 10, 3, 4, 6 -&gt; 6 , 5, 10, 3, 4 -&gt; '''sift-down''' -&gt; choose greater child 5 (2*n+0) or 10 ( 2*n+1) -&gt; is 6 &gt; 10 ? no -&gt; swap 10 and 6 -&gt;

- 10, 5, *6, 3, 4 -&gt;  4 is greatest child as no +1 child. is 6 &gt; 4 ? yes, stop.

* 10 leaves  * , 5 , 6 , 3, 4 -&gt; *4, 5, 6, 3 -&gt; is left(0) or right(+1) child greater -&gt; +1 is greater; is 4 &gt; +1 child ? no , swap 

-  6,5, *4, 3  -&gt; *4 has no children so stop.

* 6 leaves *, 5, 4, 3 -&gt; *3, 5, 4  -&gt; +0 child is greater -&gt; is 3 &gt; 5 ? no , so swap -&gt; 5, *3, 4 , *3 has no child so stop.
is 
* 5 leaves so  3, 4 -&gt; *4, 3 -&gt; +0 child greatest as no right child  -&gt; is 4 &gt; 3 ? no , so exit

* 4 leaves  3 . 

* 3 leaves *.

* numbers extracted in descending order 11, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3.

}}

* a priority queue allows elements to be inserted with a priority , and extracted according to priority. ( This can happen usefully, if the element has a paired structure, one part is the key, and the other part the data. Otherwise, it is just a mechanism for sorting ). 

* EXERCISE: Using the above technique of insert-back/challenge-parent, and delete-front/last-to-front/defer-higher-child, implement either heap sort or a priority queue.

====Dijsktra's algorithm ====
Dijsktra's algorithm is a searching algorithm using a priority queue. It begins with inserting the start node with a priority value of 0. All other
nodes are inserted with priority values of large N. Each node  has an adjacency list of other nodes, a current distance to start node, and previous pointer to previous node used to calculate current node. Alternative to an adjacency list, is an adjacency matrix, which needs n x n  boolean adjacencies.

The agorithm basically iterates over the priority queue, removing the front node, examining the adjacent nodes, and updating with a distance equal to the sum of the front nodes distance for each adjacent node , and the distance given by the adjacency information for an adjacent node. 

After each node's update, the extra operation '''&quot;update priority&quot;''' is used on that node :  

''while'' the node's distance is less than it's parents node ( for this priority queue, parents have lesser distances than the children), the node is swapped with the parent. 

After this, ''while'' the node is greater distance than one or more of its children, it is swapped with the least distant child, so the least distant child becomes parent of its greater distant sibling, and parent to the greater distant current node.  

With updating the priority, the adjacent node to the current node has a back pointer changed to the current node. 

The algorithm ends when the target node becomes the current node removed, and the path to the start node can be recorded in an array by following back pointers, and then doing something like a quick sort partition to reverse the order of the array , to give the shortest path to target node from the start node.

==== Quick sort ====
3. Write a C program to recursively sort using the Quick sort partition exchange algorithm.
* you can use the &quot;driver&quot;, or the random number test data from Q1. on mergesort. This is &quot;re-use&quot;, which is encouraged in general. 
- an advantage of reuse is less writing time, debugging time, testing time.
* the concept of partition exchange is that a partition element is (randomly) selected, and every thing that needs sorted is put into 3 equivalance
classes : those elements less than the partition value, the partition element, and everything above (and equal to ) the partition element.
* this can be done without allocating more space than one temporary element space for swapping two elements. e.g a temporary integer for integer data.
* However, where the partition element should be using the original array space is not known. 
* This is usually implemented with putting the partition on the end of the array to be sorted, and then putting two pointers , one at the start of the array,
and one at the element next to the partition element , and repeatedly scanning the left pointer right, and the right pointer left.
* the left scan stops when an element equal to or greater than the partition is found, and the right scan stops for a smaller element than the partition value,
and these are swapped, which uses the temporary extra space.
* the left scan will always stop if it reaches the partition element , which is the last element; this means the entire array is less than partition value.
* the right scan could reach the first element, if the entire array is greater than the partition , and this needs to be tested for, else the scan doesn't stop.
* the outer loop exits when then left and right pointers cross. Testing for pointer crossing and outer loop exit
should occur before swapping, otherwise the right pointer may be swapping a less-than-partition element
previously scanned by the left pointer.
* finally, the partition element needs to be put between the left and right partitions, once the pointers cross.
* At pointer crossing, the left pointer may be stopped at the partition element's last position in the array, and the right pointer not progressed past the
element just before the last element. This happens when all the elements are less than the partition. 

- if the right pointer is chosen to swap with the partition, then an incorrect state results where the last element of the left array becomes less than the partition element value.

- if the left pointer is chosen to swap with the partition, then the left array will be less than the partition, and partition will have swapped with an element with value greater than the partition
or the partition itself.   

* The corner case of quicksorting a 2 element &lt;b&gt;out-of-order&lt;/b&gt; array has to be examined. 

- The left pointer stops on the first '''out of order''' element. The right pointer begins on the first &lt;b&gt;out-of-order&lt;/b&gt; element,
but the outer loop exits because this is the leftmost element. The partition element  is then swapped with the left pointer's first element, and the two elements are now '''in order'''. 

- In the case of a 2 element '''in order''' array, the leftmost pointer skips the first element which is less than the partition, and stops on the partition. The right pointer begins on the first element and exits
because it is the first position. The pointers have crossed so the outer loop exits. The partition swaps with itself, so the in-ordering is preserved.

* After doing a swap, the left pointer should be incremented and right pointer decremented, so the same positions aren't scanned again, because an endless loop can result ( possibly when the left pointer exits when the element is equal to or greater than the partition, and the  right element is equal to the partition value).  One implementation, Sedgewick,  starts the pointers with the left pointer minus one and right pointer
the plus one the intended initial scan positions, and use the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators e.g. ( ++i, --i) .

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
One possible solution , can be to adapt this word sorting use of quicksort to sort integers. 
Otherwise , an exercise would be to re-write non-generic qsort functions of qsortsimp, partition, and swap for integers.

The '''Chinese language''' (汉语/漢語, 华语/華語 or 中文; [[Pinyin]]: [[Hanyu]], [[Huayu]], [[Zhongwen]]) is a member of the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. About one-fifth of the world speaks some form of Chinese as its native language, making it the most common natively-spoken language in the world.

There is great internal variety within Chinese, and spoken Chinese languages such as Standard Mandarin (Putonghua), Shanghainese (Wu), and Cantonese, which are not mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, there is a single standardized form of Chinese known as Standard Mandarin (国语), which is based on the dialect of Beijing, which is in turn its own Mandarin dialect, among a large and diverse group of Chinese dialects spoken in Northern and Southwestern China. Standard Mandarin is the official language of Mainland China and Chinese Taiwan, one of four official languages of Singapore, and one of six official languages of the United Nations. Standard Mandarin also corresponds to the modern standard written Chinese language used by people speaking all forms of Chinese from all corners of China, including Mandarin, Wu, Cantonese, Hakka, Min-nan, and so forth. This textbook will teach Standard Mandarin, both spoken and written.

Chinese grammar is in many ways simpler than European languages (for example, you will see no tenses, plurals, or subject-verb agreement), but there are also plenty of pitfalls that will trip up the unsuspecting beginner (for example, you will encounter tones, measure words, and discourse particles, which do not feature as strongly in European languages.) In addition, the complexity of the writing system often daunts newcomers, as Chinese is one of the few languages in the world that does not use an alphabet or a syllabary; instead, thousands of characters are used, each representing a word or a part of a word. However, most complex Chinese characters are composed of only a few hundred simpler characters and many contain phonetic hints. There is a common Western misconception of Chinese writing as having thousands of distinct and idiomatic symbols each representing a single word, however, Chinese writing is surprisingly mnemonic, granted it is not as simple as the writing of Romance languages. The government of China has developed a system of writing Standard Mandarin pronunciation in the Roman alphabet, known as ''Hanyu Pinyin'', or simply, ''pinyin'' (汉语拼音/漢語拼音, &quot;spelling according to sounds&quot;). Hanyu Pinyin is used to write out Chinese words phonetically in an effort to help learners of Chinese with their pronunciation. This wikibook will teach you Hanyu Pinyin first, before any actual sentences. All examples and new vocabulary will always be given together with Hanyu Pinyin.

There are two character sets: Simplified Chinese characters (简体字/簡體字, [[Pinyin]]: [[Jiǎntǐzì]]) and Traditional Chinese characters (繁体字/繁體字, [[Pinyin]]: [[Fántǐzì]]). Traditional characters trace their lineage through thousands of years of Chinese history, and continue to be used in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and among many overseas Chinese. Simplified Chinese characters were the result of reforms carried out in Mainland China to increase literacy rates and is now used in Singapore as well. The two systems share many of the same characters or with systematic, predictable reductions in stroke; however, some changes are not as formulaic. As a result, most native Chinese speakers are able to write in only one of the two systems, though they can usually read both. You are recommended to do the same. It is considered easier for people who learn Traditional to read both sets than people who learn Simplified only, but Simplified characters are less intimidating for beginners. In this wikibook, all examples and vocabulary are given in both systems, and you are encouraged to choose one system and stick with it throughout.

Chinese characters have also been used in the past by other neighbouring Asian countries, and are still being used by some of them today. Some older Koreans still know how to read and write Chinese characters, but although the members of younger generations are taught Chinese characters or ''hanja'', they are rarely used and unnecessary for literacy in Korean, with the native alphabet, ''hangul''. Chinese characters are occasionally used for abbreviations, to clarify technical vocabulary (as Chinese serves roughly the same role in Korean that Latin serves in English), and to write family and many personal names. The Japanese still preserve many Chinese characters or ''kanji'' today and use them along with two syllabaries to write the Japanese language.

== comment 1 ==

Uhhh...
Take the right hand side and expand
:-''m'' - (-1)''n''
which is equivalent to
:-''m''+(-1)(-1)''n''
which is
:-''m''+1''n''
:n-m
which is the desired result.

[[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 00:03, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:&lt;nowiki&gt;*grin*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Cool. Now I really know it's true! ;) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 00:32, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I found a good example for the visual proofs section - prove that the series &lt;math&gt;1^2+2^2+...+n^2&lt;/math&gt; multiplies by 4 and adds 1 when ''n'' is increased by one. No idea? Think about how many squares there are on a 16&amp;times;16 grid. [[User:212.135.1.53|212.135.1.53]] 08:29, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC) (r3m0t)

:Okay, good work. Let me think why it is so... [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 09:49, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)
::Whoops. Never even tried it out on paper, I was so convinced. No, that isn't even true *grins*. Ah well, in which case, a good recursion exercise is finding out how many squares (of any size) there are on a 16&amp;times;16 grid. The answer happens to be 1,496 (or aleph-one, depending on how you interpret the question...) I will however try and investigate how to fix that times 4 and plus 1 rule, but chances are the outcome will be pretty complicated. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 19:11, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Is the following line correct, it would seem more logical to prove v=w instead of v = u:
2. Prove using only the axioms if u + v = u + w then v = u (subtracting u from both sides is not accepted as a solution)
I can't find the solution to this problem, so it would be great if you could give me a hint
Problemset nr 1 seems to be wrong as well, the greater than sign should be turned around, otherwise simply trying n=2 will show you that it's not true[[User:Mmartin|Mmartin]] 19 july 2004
:Thanks I corrected the error. As an hint to this type of problems, we always use 0 e.g. a = a + 0. If you are still scratching your head, the solutions is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
v &amp;=&amp; v + 0\\
  &amp;=&amp; v + (u - u)\\
  &amp;=&amp; (v + u) - u\\
  &amp;=&amp; (w + u) - u\\
  &amp;=&amp; w + (u - u)\\
  &amp;=&amp; w + 0 \\
  &amp;=&amp; w
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:as  required. Thank you very much for you question. I love getting questions, it assures me that somebody out there is reading my work. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 08:42, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Hum?? ==

I've trouble on doing question 3 of the first exercise. Can you give me some hints? (Also it seems the question itself has some minor typing mistakes)
-lemontea

:Thanks for pointing it out lemontea, fixed. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 04:11, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::Now I'm completely stucked. I tried doing binomial expansion of that (i-1)^k and cancel out the highest power i^k, leaving only smaller power behind so I can employ induction, but this method failed. How did you do it? (Though I have an idea on making use of the generating function, but them this can expand to a project which the size is comparable to the project in the first chapter) [[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 18:11, 26 Dec 2004 (GMT+8)

:::I hope you dont mind, i will write out the complete solution here. You may have been confused by the questions. Anyway..

:::It's clear that 1&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... = (n+1)n/2. So we can start the induction from there.
:::Suppose that
::::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^j&lt;/math&gt;
:::has an explicit formula in terms of ''n'' for all ''j'' &lt; ''k'' (**), we aim to prove that
::::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^k&lt;/math&gt;
:::also has an explicit formula.

:::Indeed, consider
::::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - (i-1)^{k+1}] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:::I think you may have consider ^k instead of ^(k+1). Also, looking at it from another way
::::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - (i-1)^k] = \sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - i^{k+1} + i^k - i^{k-1} + ... \ 1]&lt;/math&gt;

Thanks! That helped. (Oh no, I found I was just a few steps away from the end of the solution, a ghost must have covered my eyes, ahhhhhhhhh...)
However, it seems the ending part could be written more clearly, and the above did contain some minor error...
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - (i-1)^{k(??)}]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - i^{k+1} + i^k - i^{k-1} + ... \ 1]&lt;/math&gt;(Shouldn't there be some binomial coefficient when expanding out?)

I thought the principle would be like the below:
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - (i-1)^{k+1}] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - \sum_{j=0}^{k+1} {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^{k+1} - {k+1 \choose k+1} i^{k+1} - \sum_{j=0}^k {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[\sum_{j=0}^k {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k[\sum_{i=1}^n {k+1 \choose j} i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;(Huh, I think I'll have to write another sub-chapter on the nested/2-dimensional sum notation operation...)&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^k[{k+1 \choose j} \sum_{i=1}^n i^j] = n^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think things should be clear now :)

However, after doing this question I feel the urge to feedback my strong opinion on this solution. The exsistence of a formula is usually to help people do calculation faster and easier, but like above, the result is that the formula relies on combining all of the pervious formula in that series, although the formula is still a finite calculation, but when k increases to somewhere like 10, the so called &quot;formula&quot; will become so complex that it lost its elegence, and that it doesn't serve the function of reliefing difficulties in calculations anymore.
[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 10:37, 28 Dec 2004 (GMT+8)
:You are right about the coefficient, i just forgot. Good wook. You comment about the solution is correct, may i remind you that the point of the question is to test induction skills, although you are absolutely right about the deficiency of the question. Thanks. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 03:01, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I know that for mathematicians, it is considered an art to say just enough....to find a balance between not giving every single step, but yet making the point clear to a fellow mathematician.  However, non-mathematicians don't necessarily think this way.  I know we want the reader to think and ask, but we don't also want them to think they're stupid and give up.  It seems that one of the beauties of this sort of media is that perhaps we can provide the extra explanation, yet bury it with hyperlinks, etc.  The above discussion is one such example.[[User:Lizmaemom|Lizmaemom]] ([[User talk:Lizmaemom|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lizmaemom|contribs]]) 23:56, 3 July 2011 (UTC)

== M5? ==

M5:for every a there exist b such that ab=1

What about 0? Does a inverse of 0 exist?
--[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 13:42, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: See, that's what I mean about messy (I don't mean the omission, that's an easy mistake to make, but the ''way'' the thing was structured). There's a better way of saying this (which I'll just say now, so you'll see what I mean). [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:25, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)


== Incorrect Proof ==
A lot can be learned by being asked to find the mistaken logic in an incorrect proof, of which many can be found online.  One is as follows for Goldbach's conjecture:
::step 1:  Any even number &gt;=6 can be described by 6Q +b, b={-2,0,+2}
(thus any even number is either 2 behind, 2 ahead, or coincident with, a multiple of 6)
Thus, we can write E = 6Q +b
::step 2:  a recognized required (but not sufficient) condition for any prime&gt;=5 is that they are of the form 6N +/1 (it is 1 ahead or behind a multiple of 6)

::step 3:  rewrite step 1 as  (any) even = 6L+/-1 + 6M +/-1

We can substitute step 2 into step 3 and get:
::step 4:  (any &gt;3) even  = prime1 + prime2

the above essentially &quot;proves&quot; GC - where is the mistake in the proof?--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] ([[User talk:Billymac00|talk]]) 02:41, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

== Feedback ==
This section is fascinating. I hope you can improve it. Some examples are tough to understand and I hope you can explain them better. --[[Special:Contributions/200.120.252.46|200.120.252.46]] ([[User talk:200.120.252.46|talk]]) 01:08, 5 May 2010 (UTC)

Shouldn't math mode be used for writing mathematical statements? --[[User:Ranadeakshay|ranade]]

== Additive Inverse ? ==

Here is axiom three in the Axioms and inference section :
A3: For every a, there exist b (written -a), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive inverse)
Not that I am mathematician or anything but I think inverse is not the right word, -a is the &lt;u&gt;opposit&lt;/u&gt; of a, right?

Would you have a place for this approach?
[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Sum_of_i.pdf A scientific approach to mathematics - Observation of patterns then proving them]

Mathematics is a hobby of mine and on more than one occasion, I've reinvented the wheel.  This paper is one such example.  Therefore, even though it is original work for me, Bernoulli was the first to use this approach.  At least that is what a Washington University professor told me.  This also means that it can be published on Wiki without violating the policy against original work.  It also means that I am free to offer it as public domain.  I have solved problems that only the greats in mathematics are given credit, but I lack a formal education in mathematics, so I would never be able to convince any journal to publish my work.  Yet, I've been able to impress others with my knowledge and ability to invent new approaches to solve problems.  Being in a position without the credentials, I always provide irrefutable evidence that my approaches are correct.  Most Ph.D professors can't say the same.  I don't need credit for any of my work in math nor do I need any money.  I'm making a comfortable living using my mind in the sciences.  But, I would be greatly rewarded if I could share some of my understanding with young people.  I'd like to get other people to think outside the box.  The traditional lessons are important, but I would also like to see young people learn the value of creativity.  Mathematics is also tainted with an image of logic and theory instead of as a true science.  The paper that I'm offering here is a good example of how a problem can be solved by starting with observation.</text>

{{Chinese (Mandarin)TOC}}


==Speaking and Pronunciation==
* '''Learn pinyin'''. Not only is it used throughout this book to explain proper pronunciation, it is needed to look up words in dictionaries and to type in Chinese.
* '''Pay attention to the tones.''' Since there are so few syllables in Chinese, there are many homonyms, making attention to tones very important. Learning to write the pinyin with correct tones at the same time as you learn the characters will improve your pronunciation and your listening comprehension.
* '''Read the text aloud.''' Speaking (and hearing yourself speak) will help reinforce the text in your memory.  Exaggerating the tones can help you remember them. In Chinese, character (something that when writing takes a space unit), word (which may include some characters or a single character), and sentence may be different from English. When speaking Chinese, the pronunciation of each character should be a single unit.
* '''Find a language partner.''' There may be a Chinese language club in a nearby city or university. There are also free websites on the Internet that can help you set up a language exchange using [http://www.skype.com Skype] or other VoIP programs. Two examples are [http://www.language-exchanges.org The Mixxer] and [http://www.slf.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/etandem/etindex-en.html E-Tandem].
* '''Use a Text To Speech (TTS) service.''' In other words, have a computer read the text for you. Free examples include [http://translate.google.com Google Translate] and [http://imtranslator.net/translate-and-speak/ imtranslator.net]. Google Translate can not only read the text (the volume icon, not available for large texts) but also give you the pinyin (the A with the umlaut), and, of course, translate.
* '''Consume Chinese media.''' Immersing yourself in Chinese after learning the basics will make learning easier. To learn pronunciation, make the voices of native speakers your constant companions, and after finishing this book, continue to immerse yourself—you will have learned enough to take on Chinese &quot;in the wild&quot;. A wide variety of multimedia options exist for exposing your ears to native Chinese speakers. Two of the best sites for easy listening materials are [http://popupchinese.com Popup Chinese] and [http://chineseclass101.com ChineseClass101.com]. Advanced learners can listen to broadcasts of [http://www.xinhua.org/ Xinhua], China's official news network, or visit [http://www.youku.com Youku], a Chinese incarnation of YouTube (YouTube is blocked in China, and Facebook as well, for that matter). Download as much audio as you can from these sites to your MP3 player and start listening. You can listen to Chinese whenever you're in the car, commuting, or doing mechanical tasks. Note that, since Internet Explorer 6 is still a popular browser in China, Chinese websites may seem a bit quirky, and video streaming services may not work at all on modern browsers.

==Reading and Writing==

* '''Practice writing—a lot.''' When you study, write a character at least ten times, and more if you have trouble remembering it. You can find special grid paper for writing practice with Chinese characters on the Internet; for example, PDF sheets are available on [http://www.uvm.edu/~chinese/characte.htm UVM's web site], and a practice sheet generator is available at [http://www.chinesetools.eu/tools/chinese-grid/ www.chinesetools.eu] (or [http://www.chine-informations.com/chinois/outils/generateur-grille/ original site], French). The output is set up as a grid, so that a typical printer can print 11 characters with 8 boxes each per page in portrait mode, giving each character one row, or 5 characters with 17 boxes each, and so on. In landscape mode, a printer can print 8 characters with 11 boxes each per page, or 4 characters with 23 boxes each giving each character two lines. Remember to quiz yourself periodically to test your memory and to find which characters you need to practice more. As you write, think of the sound and meaning of the character, or say it out loud. Check out the [[East Asian Calligraphy]] wikibook for more help with Chinese writing. Learn the correct stroke order initially and write carefully, looking at the printed character each time before copying. Actually writing is important to establish a 'motor memory' of each character, which will allow your writing to flow more easily.

* '''Use a flashcard program.''' Many people who use flash cards memorize information, but there's often much time wasted reviewing what they already know well, or in relearning what they forgot. The free programs [http://www.ichi2.net/anki/ Anki] and [http://mnemosyne-proj.org/index.php Mnemosyne], can optimize your review schedule using their algorithms. They can also use audio for pronunciation help and 3-sided cards to study reading, writing, and translation separately. You can download [http://mnemosyne-proj.org/taxonomy/term/7 free cardsets], [http://shengci.wojas.nl/mnemosyne export your own], or write them yourself to fully customize your character selection.

[[Image:Radical053.png|l|thumb|80px|A radical highlighted in 3 characters]]
* '''Look for radicals.''' [[w:Radical (Chinese character)|Radicals]] are components of Chinese characters that you will see repeated over and over again. Learning the meaning of radicals will help you to see the connections between similar categories of words. Many characters are comprised of radical-phonetic pairings, where the radical is the &quot;root&quot; that hints at the meaning of the word, while another part of the character hints at the sound of the word. Learning to spot radicals is also useful since they can be used when looking up words when you don't know the pinyin in Chinese dictionaries.

* '''Buy a dictionary.''' They're useful for looking up new words or just browsing. Beginner's dictionaries have larger fonts, usage examples, and Pinyin pronunciation, all of which are sometimes missing in comprehensive dictionaries. [http://cc-cedict.org CC-CEDICT] is a thorough Chinese-English dictionary available under Creative Commons. [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ktdict-c-e-chinese-english/id291179703 KTdict C-E] is a free iOS app that uses CEDICT. A good physical dictionary that provides many example sentences and phrases is ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198602588/ref=pd_sim_b_2/002-3287198-3112035?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155 The Starter Oxford Chinese Dictionary]'' (Simplified characters only). A good online dictionary would be [http://www.nciku.com/ nciku]. It is searchable by pinyin, characters, and sketches, via a drawing panel. It not only contains definitions, also shows the stroke order of a character, and gives examples of its use.

The sentece &quot;Heinrich und Karl sind Freunde als sie sich auf der Straße begegnen&quot; sounds strange for German ears. --- I have changed that and hope, it won't be in a too strong conflict with the sound sample.

For me, it sounds strange, too, using the word &quot;Geschäftsmänner&quot; when talking about a woman and a man. I'd propose to say &quot;Geschäftsleute&quot;, but I didn't want to change the complete excercise. -- 12-14-2003 Hans.

::OK, but if you ask that, you expect to get a real answer and not simply a &quot;Sehr gut&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language, and is a layer over the [[Programming:C|C programming language]]. This means that if you know how to write C, there are only a few syntax changes to learn.

In this section, we will look at how we can implement classes and instantiate objects in Objective-C. If you are unfamiliar with object-oriented programming, see [[Programming:Objective-C concepts|Objective-C concepts]]. 

== Basic syntax ==
If you have studied C, you can skip this section and proceed to the next section, [[#A word on runtimes|A word on runtimes]].  If not, or if you're a little rusty, read on.

In C, code is contained within a function.  Functions are composed of several statements, each of which are terminated by a semicolon. For example, a simple function in C to add two numbers may look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
int add (int a, int b)
{
    int c;
    c = a + b;
    return c;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This sample has the following lines:
# The function definition (which returns an int (integer), is named ''add'', and takes two parameters, both of which are integers). // Integers are whole numbers like 6, 66 or 567 and not numbers with decimal places like 5.6.
# The opening function brace
# A variable declaration
# An assignment statement
# A return statement, which returns the value of c to the calling function/
# The closing function brace

For control flow, C and Objective-C use:
# for (&amp;lt;initial&gt;;&amp;lt;condition&gt;;&amp;lt;increment&gt;) 
# while (&amp;lt;condition&gt;)
# do ... while (&amp;lt;condition&gt;)
# switch (&amp;lt;condition&gt;)
# if (&lt;condition&gt;) then {&lt;statements&gt;} [else &lt;statements&gt;]
The for, while, and do statements will continue execution of a loop until the condition is false. The switch and if statements jump to different statements depending on the condition.

Objective-C does not implement or import any functions by default.  Instead, they need to be imported by using the &lt;code&gt;#import&lt;/code&gt; preprocessor directive. (#include works too, but generally it is not used in Objective-C - #import works better because it won't import the same thing twice like #include can try to do)

== A word on runtimes ==
Objective-C requires what is known as a ''runtime system'' to provide you with Objective-C features. The runtime takes care of the creation, management, and destruction of objects.

If you have the &lt;tt&gt;gcc&lt;/tt&gt; compiler, you should have the Objective-C runtime already installed. Otherwise, you may have to install the runtime separately. Note that [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] is a compiler collection; the full install contains not only the C compiler, but also C++, Java, Objective-C and even Fortran-95 and Ada 2005 compilers. However, &lt;em&gt;it is possible to install gcc only partially&lt;/em&gt;, for example only the C compiler. Therefore, the Objective-C runtime may or may not be installed with gcc. Check your distribution. 

Two main systems are used to run Objective-C programs:
* the GNU runtime, which is provided as a part of gcc on Unix and Unix-like operating systems;
* the NeXT runtime, which is provided on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and Mac OS X operating systems.

This text assumes you are using the GNU runtime, but the two runtime systems are almost identical.

This text does not cover the OPENSTEP, Cocoa, or GNUstep frameworks, but the skills learned here will be helpful when developing with those systems.

== Writing classes in Objective-C ==
Writing an Objective-C class requires a few design decisions before we start writing any code. Say we are writing a class to represent a point called &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt; in a two-dimensional plane.

We need to ask ourselves two questions:
# What data do we need to store and use? This relates to the ''instance variables'' we need to declare. 
# What operations do we need to perform? This relates to the ''methods'' we need to define.



For this example, we'll use &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; variables for the ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates. We'll define a method to get both coordinates, and we'll define a method to get their distance from the origin.

== The interface ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &lt;objc/Object.h&gt;

@interface Point : Object
{
@private
   double x;
   double y;
}

- (id) x: (double) x_value;
- (double) x;
- (id) y: (double) y_value;
- (double) y;
- (double) magnitude;
@end
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's examine what each element of this interface means.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &lt;objc/Object.h&gt;
 
@interface Point : Object
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;@interface&lt;/tt&gt; line says that we begin the declaration of the &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt; interface. We inherit from another class called &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;. Objective-C provides you with a generic class, called &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt; class is a ''root class'' -- it does not inherit from another class. The &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt; class provides a set of methods that provide key functionality for an object to be used and recognized by the Objective-C runtime. As in C, we need to include &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;'s header file, &lt;tt&gt;Object.h&lt;/tt&gt;, before we can use the set of methods declared in the header.

If you don't explicitly inherit from some class, your class becomes a root class. (In Objective-C, there can be many root classes.) That's probably not what you want to do, because creating a root class is a very tricky and advanced topic that is only useful in very specific situations. In most cases, you will want to inherit from &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt; or some class that inherits from &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. If you develop in NeXTStep / GNUstep / Cocoa, you will mostly be using another root class called &lt;tt&gt;NSObject&lt;/tt&gt;, which provides different basic methods than &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;.

The word &lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; means that we only include the file ''once''. This solves problems like recursive includes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
{
@private
   double x;
   double y;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Anything between the braces in an interface declaration specifies the instance variables that the class has. 

The &lt;tt&gt;@private&lt;/tt&gt; line is a visibility modifier: it says that the instance variables after it are ''private'', i.e. they are accessible only from the class that declares them. It is good practice to mark all your instance variables private: they contain the state of an object and they should never be changed except by the object itself.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (id) x: (double) x_value;
&lt;/source&gt;
The declarations for the methods come after the instance variables. This is a declaration for the method to set the x value. It's common Objective-C style to name the setter method with the same name as the variable it's setting.

The hyphen specifies an instance method (we'll look at these later). Then comes the name for the method (this method is called &lt;tt&gt;x:&lt;/tt&gt; - note the colon), and the colon signifies an argument, called &lt;tt&gt;x_value&lt;/tt&gt;, and is of type &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;.

The cast on the &lt;tt&gt;x_value&lt;/tt&gt; argument is necessary, because unlike C, the default type is &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt;, and not &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. The type &lt;tt&gt;id&lt;/tt&gt; is very special—it is a type that can hold ''any'' object whatsoever. The first cast is not strictly necessary, but should be used for clarity. The first cast tells us that the method &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; returns an object back.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (double) x;
&lt;/source&gt;
This is another method named &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; (no colon), but it returns a &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;. This is the specification for the method that gets the value of the x variable. There is no conflict with the previous method because the types are different, and the previous method takes one argument whilst this takes none. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
@end
&lt;/source&gt;
After all the methods and instance variables are specified, this symbol marks the end of the declaration.

The interface specification goes in a &lt;tt&gt;.h&lt;/tt&gt; file—a header file. It's customary to call the file after the class, so we would create a file called &lt;tt&gt;Point.h&lt;/tt&gt;.

== The implementation ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &quot;Point.h&quot;
#import &lt;math.h&gt;

@implementation Point

- (id) x: (double) x_value
{
   x = x_value;
   return self;
}

- (double) x
{
   return x;
}

- (id) y: (double) y_value
{
   y = y_value;
   return self;
}

- (double) y
{
   return y;
}

- (double) magnitude
{
   return sqrt(x*x+y*y);
}

@end
&lt;/source&gt;

This is the implementation for the &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt; class. We implement the methods in the interface defined above. Let's have a look at each element of the implementation in turn.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &quot;Point.h&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Again, we import &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt;'s interface, just as we do in C.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
@implementation Point
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a marker that identifies the beginning of the implementation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (id) x: (double) x_value
{
   x = x_value;
   return self;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a typical method implementation. We can use the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; variable directly without having to declare it since it is already declared in the interface, and is accessible only to the methods of this class. The behaviour, in general, is like an ordinary C function. Here we assign the value of the argument &lt;tt&gt;x_value&lt;/tt&gt; to the instance variable &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;.

The function then, returns the entire, current object as modified. The keyword &lt;tt&gt;self&lt;/tt&gt; represents the current object.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (double) x
{
   return x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here is the simple method to get the value of the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; variable. We simply return it.



The behaviour for the other methods should be similar to those above. The &lt;tt&gt;@end&lt;/tt&gt; keyword ends the implementation.

The implementation specification goes in a &lt;tt&gt;.m&lt;/tt&gt; file. It's customary to call the file after the class, so we would create a file called &lt;tt&gt;Point.m&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Using the objects ==
Since Objective-C comes from C, we write a &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function to make use of the class that we just created. Here's one typical main function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &quot;Point.h&quot;
#import &lt;math.h&gt;
#import &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   Point *point = [Point new];
   [point x:10.0];
   [point y:12.0];
   printf(&quot;The distance from the point (%g, %g) to the origin is %g.\n&quot;,
      [point x], [point y], [point magnitude]);
    
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Let's examine what happens here.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &quot;Point.h&quot;
#import &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
We import the interface to &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt; so we can use it. We import &lt;tt&gt;stdio.h&lt;/tt&gt; so we can use &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
    Point *point = [Point new];
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a typical Objective-C method call:
* &lt;tt&gt;Point *point&lt;/tt&gt; declares, technically, a pointer to an instance of type &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt;. Actually, it may be best to think of this merely as a variable holding a &lt;tt&gt;Point&lt;/tt&gt; object, but keep the pointer idea in mind.
* &lt;tt&gt;[Point new]&lt;/tt&gt; calls a method called &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt;. The first half before the space represents the object we call the method on. The second half is the method name and arguments. The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; method is called a ''class method'', because it doesn't do something with respect to an instance of a class, it does something with respect to the class itself. The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; method allocates memory and initializes the object, making it ready for use.  There is no need to explicitly delete an object, as Objective C keeps track of the number of references to a given object, and deallocates them as necessary.
*: NOTE: The &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; method is shorthand for &lt;tt&gt;alloc&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt; and may not always be available. If it is not, the object can be initialized and made ready for use in the following fashion: &lt;tt&gt;[[Point alloc] init]&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
    [point x:10.0];
    [point y:12.0];
&lt;/source&gt;
These are some typical instance method calls. We call &lt;tt&gt;point&lt;/tt&gt;'s method &lt;tt&gt;x:&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y:&lt;/tt&gt;. In Objective-C terminology, we say that we send &lt;tt&gt;point&lt;/tt&gt; a message to apply to the method &lt;tt&gt;x:&lt;/tt&gt;.

These messages assign &lt;tt&gt;point&lt;/tt&gt;'s &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; variables. Recall that the &lt;tt&gt;x:&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y:&lt;/tt&gt; methods had in them &lt;tt&gt;return self;&lt;/tt&gt;. This means that we can chain the two messages together, as follows:
 [[point x:10.0] y:12.0];

The message &lt;tt&gt;[point x:10.0]&lt;/tt&gt; returns an object, &lt;tt&gt;point&lt;/tt&gt;, with its &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; variable set. Then ''on that object'', the outer message assigns its &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
    printf(&quot;The distance from the point (%g, %g) to the origin is %g.\n&quot;,
       [point x], [point y], [point magnitude]);
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; statement has in it the method calls &lt;tt&gt;[point x]&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns the value of the &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; variable for printing, &lt;tt&gt;[point y]&lt;/tt&gt;, which does the same for the &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; variable for printing, and &lt;tt&gt;[point magnitude]&lt;/tt&gt; which calculates the distance and returns that value.

__NOTOC__
'''Apple Cobbler''' is a [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] made up of a baked apple filling and a simple topping. It is similar to [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|Apple Crisp]], which has a crunchy topping made with oatmeal.

==Ingredients==
=== Filling ===
*6 cups sliced, peeled and cored baking [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
*2/3 cup [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*6 Tbs [[cookbook:water|water]] (divided into 4 and 2)
*1 Tbs [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]

=== Topping ===
*1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 Tbs [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
=== Filling ===
#Stir together apples, 2/3 cup sugar and 4 Tbs water in a large sauce-pan. Simmer, covered for 5 minutes or until fruit is tender.
#Add 2 Tbs water and 1 Tbs cornstarch. Cook and stir until thick and bubbly. 

=== Topping ===
#In a medium bowl stir together flour, 2 Tbs sugar, and baking powder.
#Cut in butter until mixture resembles large crumbs. Set aside.
#In a small bowl stir together the egg and milk. Add to flour mixture, just to moisten.

=== Assembly ===
#Transfer filling to 2-quart square baking dish.
#Using a large spoon, drop topping into small mounds on top of the filling.
#Bake for 20-25 minutes in a 400 °F oven (205 °C).

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Cobblers can be made with peaches, pears, nectarines, apricots, and various types of berries.

'''Barbecued Spare Ribs''' are a classic [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] barbecue meal made from pork.  This version is cooked in the oven, not on a barbecue, and uses a [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]] with a distinct [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian]] flavor, featuring soy sauce, rice vinegar, and garlic.

==Ingredients==
*2 pounds [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] spare ribs
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|hoisin sauce]] 
*2 tablespoons white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]] 
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
*1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground white [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Stock|pork stock]] 
* freshly ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Place spare ribs in a large baking dish in one layer. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Pour over spare ribs and coat on both sides. [[Cookbook:Marinating|Marinate]] overnight, [[Cookbook:Basting|basting]] occasionally.
#Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375 °F]]. Place a large, shallow roasting pan on the oven bottom. Fill with 1/2 inch water. Place spare ribs on a roasting rack. 
#Roast ribs for 45 minutes. 
#Raise oven temperature to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|450 °F]], and roast for 15 more minutes. 
#Serve hot or cold.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Alternatively, Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375 °F]] for 20 mins then lower the temp to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|325 °F]] for 1 hour; this renders most of the fat and produces very tender meat.
*To actually barbecue the ribs on a grill, get grill temperature to 225 degrees and cook for 5-6 hours.

__FORCETOC__
'''[[w:Chocolate Chip Cookies|Chocolate Chip Cookies]]''' is a cookie with chocolate chips built in. Originated from the USA, one of the most traditional/popular cookies around.
==Ingredients==

*2 sticks (½ [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] / 225 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]] / 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (and only butter), softened
*¾ cup (180[[Cookbook:Milliliter|ml]]) granulated white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*¾ cup (180ml) packed [[Cookbook:Brown_Sugar|brown sugar]]
*¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla_Extract|vanilla extract]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 ¼ cups (600ml) (290g) [[Cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking_Soda|baking soda]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 teaspoon dry ground [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] or [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] peel (optional)
*2 cups (480ml) (12-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] package) [[Cookbook:Chocolate_chip|semi-sweet chocolate morsels / chips]]
*5 oz. (150g) chopped nuts, such as groundnuts (optional)

==Procedure==

#Preheat oven to {{#invoke:temperature|f|375}} ({{#invoke:temperature|c|210}}), or {{#invoke:temperature|f|350}} ({{#invoke:temperature|c|195}}) if you want chewy cookies.
#Cream butter (or margarine), granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large mixer bowl.
#Add eggs one at a time, beating until fully incorporated.
#Add vanilla extract and beat in.
#In a small bowl, sift together the dry ingredients (except chocolate &amp; nuts).  Add to the wet mixture in two parts and fold until combined. (If you beat this too long, you may get some [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] formation which will change the cookie texture).
#Stir in chocolate morsels (chips), and nuts if using. Please be considerate of people with nut allergies by mentioning the nuts if you use them.
#Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets.  There should be enough fat in the cookie dough to prevent sticking, but using parchment paper or non-stick pans may help if you find this not to be the case.
#Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown (cooking times may vary). Let stand for about 1 minute and remove from hot baking sheet to cool on a wire rack.
Serves 10

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*The quality of the flavoring ingredients makes a great difference in the outcome.  Using top-quality butter,  chocolate, and vanilla will produce a superior cookie.
** Note that using &quot;dark&quot; chocolate (&gt;65% cacoa) will result in a significantly different taste than the &quot;traditional&quot; recipe. In general, if you find the raw chocolate to be too bitter or not enjoyable to eat, you may not like them in the cookies (no matter the quality).
*If you want to use regular flour, as well as butter, the trick is to increase the amount of flour to 3+ cups, which should result in a fairly stiff dough, that will not spread out very much. This trick even works with whole wheat flour.
*Use cake flour instead of all-purpose, replace granulated sugar with brown sugar and use butter instead of margarine. Using cake flour and brown sugar allows you to use butter without fear of your cookies becoming puddles (which is the only reason to use margarine in the first place).
* Use some vegetable shortening in place of butter/margarine to reduce &quot;spread&quot; (cookies will be thicker).
** Or add some vegetable oil (no more than 1/5 of total fat) in place of butter/margarine to increase spread, resulting in thinner cookies.
*Some people also recommend chilling dough before baking, though this is usually not necessary. 
** Chilling dough may help to reduce spread, resulting in thicker cookies.
* Use an ungreased, non-stick baking sheet instead of a greased sheet to help reduce spread, for thicker cookies. 
** Conversely, grease your sheet if you like thinner (crispier) cookies.
*If vanilla extract is not readily available, substitute two teaspoons of vanilla sugar for granulated sugar.
*Using chopped bar chocolate instead of pre-formed chips will result in a more rustic texture -- just make sure the pieces are small enough to eat comfortably.
*The proportion of granulated to brown sugar may be adjusted to suit taste.
** More brown sugar will result in chewier cookies.
** More white sugar will result in crisper cookies.
*Do not stack hot cookies otherwise they will bend out of shape and not cool as quickly..
* Add a small amount of oatmeal to give cookies more flavor &amp; mouth-feel.
* For a stronger nut flavor, toast the nuts. Spread them evenly on a baking pan and set them in the 350 degree oven for ten minutes. Take them out and let them cool before adding them to the dough.



Makes 56 cookies.

====Ingredients====
*2 sticks (1 cup) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], softened 
*1 cup (240ml) granulated white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 cup (240ml) packed [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*2 extra large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]] 
*2 cups (480ml) [[Cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]]
*2 cups (480ml) [[Cookbook:Oat flour|oat flour]] 
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*2 cups (480ml) (12-ounce package) Semi-sweet chocolate morsels / [[Cookbook:Chocolate chip|chocolate chips]]
*4 oz (120g) grated milk chocolate (1/2 a bar)
*3 cups (720ml) your favorite chopped [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]] (optional)

====Procedure====
#Preheat oven to 375° F (around 200c).
#Cream butter and both sugars in a large mixer bowl.  
#Beat in eggs and vanilla extract.
#Sift together the flour, salt, oat flour, baking powder and baking soda.  
#Stir in chocolate morsels, grated chocolate bar and nuts.
#Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Instead of a cookie sheet, I use a pizza stone.
#Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown (cooking times may vary). Remove and let stand for about 1 minute before moving cookies to a plate or cooling sheet.

 ''

I don't think this is actually true. The difference between the s,p,d,and,f, is the angular momentum not the wavelength., isn't it ?

:Yes. The distinguishing feature is the angular momentum quantum number, ''l''. Also, it's not always true that the s orbital has the lowest energy, since the energy is most strongly dependent on the energy level quantum number, ''n''. So the 4s shell is higher in energy than the 2p, for instance. [[User:DrBob|DrBob]] 21:07, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)
It is true however that the s orbital has the lowest energy ''within'' any given shell. I've attempted to get rid of all the errors on the page. i would apprieciate someonel looking the page over to spot any errors I may have made. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:56, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== utterly incomprehensible ==

The explaination of the wave on a guitar string is not comprehendable unless the reader has some kind of pre-requisite knowledge...I dont know what that pre-requisite knowledge is, I just know that I for one dont have it.  I rather expect the example is one that only makes sense if one has knowledge from a more advanced field than general chemistry (physics perhaps)...in other words exactly the kind of knowledge one can assume 99.999999% of prospective readers of a text of this kind (people who dont yet know even about basic general chemistry) would have....

== What?! ==

I give up even trying to comprehend this text, I suspect that the author/s are so familiar with advanced concepts that they have failed to realise that comprehending the text requires knowledge far more advanced than anyone who needs a introductory general chemistry text would possess...

== huh? ==

I'm pretty good at chemistry, but this module makes almost no sense to me. It needs a ''major'' rewrite. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 16:05, 14 May 2007 (UTC)

== QUESTION ==

DOES ORBITALS EXTENDED FROM S P D F???? I MEAN G H???

== Possible Error ==
I believe a mistake is in the text of the &quot;Electron Shells&quot; section.
In this statement &quot;In a one-electron atom (e.g. H, He+, Li+, etc.) the energy ...&quot;,  Li+ is not a single electron atom; but Li++ (or Li 2+) would be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorry this is the wrong answer.It is quite possible to answe this question from the information given.

From Ohm's Law

:R=V/I

But V/I is also the ''slope'' (or ''gradient'') of the line on the graph. So with a constant slope, we must have a constant resistance.

Soup is a savoury liquid food that is made by combining ingredients, such as meat, vegetables and/or legumes in hot stock or water, until the flavor is extracted.

Traditionally, soups are classified into two broad groups: clear soups and thick soups. The established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consommé. Thick soups are classified depending upon the type of thickening agent used: purées are vegetable soups thickened with starch; bisques are made from puréed shellfish thickened with cream; cream soups are thickened with béchamel sauce; and veloutés are thickened with eggs, butter and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include rice, flour, and grain.

==History==

The word soup originates from &quot;sop&quot;, a dish originally consisting of a soup or thick stew which was soaked up with pieces of bread. The modern meaning of sop has been limited to just the bread intended to be dipped.

Boiling was not a common cooking technique until the invention of waterproof containers (which probably came in the form of pouches made of clay or animal skin) about 5,000 years ago (possibly longer), so soups presumably were little-known before that time.

With the invention of microwave ovens, it is possible to prepare soup without the long hours of traditional stove-top simmering. While microwave soups can be completed in minutes, slow cookers and crock pot soup recipes often require many hours to complete albeit with the convenience of virtually unattended cooking and low energy usage.

* Do add new material and examples and make corrections.  It all helps.
* Decide whether new material is book 1,2 or 3.  We want book 1 to be ready to use in K12 education.  Book 3, especially the for-enthusiasts parts can progress to post-graduate level - that's fine - as long as it's still recognisably trig.
* Have a look at [[Trigonometry/Teachers_Notes/About_This_Book|About This Book]], and even modify that, so we have a planned structure and so that it's easier for people to know where to add new content.

All help is welcome.

==Trigonometry Book 1==
Book 1 is pre-calculus trigonometry.  We assume the student is relatively new to algebra and do algebra step by step.  

Many of the pages have closely related free/YouTube [[Trigonometry/Teachers_Notes/Khan_Academy_Videos|videos at the Khan Academy]].  This is by design.  Many students find the video presentation helpful with learning mathematical material.

As with all three trigonometry books, we have a &quot;[[Trigonometry/For Enthusiasts/Introductions|for Enthusiasts]]{{stage|25%}}&quot; section, which is for the student who finds the normal content and pace too slow and too easy, and yet still needs exercises and practice with Book 1 trigonometry.

== Trigonometry Book 2 ==
Book 2 is also pre-calculus trigonometry.  However, the algebra moves at a brisker pace than in Book 1.  The topics are not central to understanding trigonometry as it is usually taught in schools, now that a lot of former content has been dropped.  

One rule of thumb of the topics in Book 2 is the union of the set of all topics in high-school contest related to trigonometry, applications, and the topics in the classical book ''Plane and Spherical Trigonometry'' by Palmer [http://archive.org/details/planeandspherica029718mbp (link)], subtracting any thoroughly discussed topics in Book 1, and excluding any topic that requires substantial use of calculus or the concept of limit (which should be done in Book 3).

The topics are useful, for example, for students interested in maths contests.  In the enthusiasts section there are topics and exercises that are useful to students who will go on to do work with computer graphics.  

Book 2 trigonometry deepens the understanding of the many relationships ''between triangles and circles''.  It also shows how to tackle some harder trigonometric function identities.

Book 3 uses and builds on calculus, complex numbers, matrices.  We assume the student is relatively fluent with algebra.  We will often combine simple steps to keep proofs/explanations short.  Book 1 is a prerequisite, but book 2 isn't.

There are many computing related topics, particularly in the &quot;for Enthusiasts&quot; section.

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;b&gt;There are 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in&lt;br&gt;
a complete circle&lt;/b&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}


==Units of Measure==

We have been measuring angles in degrees, with 360&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; in a complete circle.

===Choice of Units for Length and Weight===
In measuring many quantities we have a choice of units.  For example with distances we can use the metric system and measure in metres, kilometres, centimetres, millimetres.  It is also possible to measure distances in miles, yards, feet and inches.  With weights we can measure in kilogrammes and grammes.  We can also measure in pounds and ounces.

===Choice of Units for Measuring Time===
In measuring time we choose to have sixty seconds in a minute and sixty minutes in an hour.  We could devise a new more metric system for time and divide an hour into 100 units, each three fifths of our current minute, and then divide these shorter 'minutes' up into 100 units each of which would be about a third of a second.  

===Why 60?  Why 360?===
The choice of dividing into 60 is not entirely arbitrary.  60 can be divided evenly into 2,3,4,5 or 6 or 10 or 12 parts.  60 can't be divided evenly into 7 equal parts, each a whole number in size, but it's still pretty good.  Using 360 degrees in a full circle gives us many ways to divide the circle evenly with a whole number of degrees.  Nevertheless, we could divide the circle into other numbers of units.

==Metric Degrees?==

From the earlier talk of the metric system you might be anticipating that we are about to divide the circle up into 100 or 1000 'degrees'.  There ''is'' actually a unit called the 'grade' or 'Gradian' (Grad on calculators which have it) in which angles are measured by dividing a right angle up into 100 equal parts, each of one Gradian in size.  One Gradian is 0.9 of a degree - quite close to being one degree.  The grade is in turn divided into 100 minutes and one minute into 100 seconds.  This ''centesimal'' system (from the Latin ''centum'', 100) was introduced as part of the metric system after the French Revolution.  The Gradian unit is nothing like as widely used as either degrees or the units that interests us most on this page.  The unit we introduce here is called the Radian.

==Choice of Units for Radians==

Radians are quite large compared to degrees (and to Gradians).  There are about 6.28 Radians to a complete circle.  There are about 57.3 degrees in one Radian.

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Check the Statements}}
Are the statements:
* There are about 6.28 Radians to a complete circle.  
* There are about 57.3 degrees in one Radian.
Compatible?  It is not hard to check.  

: '''Digression:''' In maths books it is well worth quickly checking statements that can be checked easily.  It helps reinforce your understanding and confirm that you are understanding what is being said.  Also, unfortunately, it isn't that unusual for maths books have tiny slips in them, where the person writing the book has written say, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x_i&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x_j&lt;/math&gt; or some other small slip.  These tend to happen where the author knows the material very well and is seeing what he expects to see rather than what is actually written.  They can be very confusing to someone new to the material.  These kinds of mistakes can also happen in wikibooks, sometimes a visitor trying to improve the content can actually introduce errors.  In wikibooks you may also see sudden changes in notation or notation that does not match a diagram, where material has been written by different people.

{{Robox/Close}}


We said &quot;there are about 6.28 Radians to a complete circle&quot;.  The exact number is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, making the number of radians in a complete circle the same as the length of the circumference of a unit circle.

Remember that: 

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;b&gt;The circumference of a circle is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\pi \times R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle R&lt;/math&gt; is the radius.&lt;/b&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}



==Justifying Choice of Units for Radians==

At this stage in explaining trigonometry it is rather difficult to justify the use of these strange units.  There aren't even an exact whole number of radians in a complete circle.  In more advanced work, particularly when we use calculus they become the most natural units to use for angles with functions like &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  A flavour of that, but it is only a hint as to why it is a good unit to use, is that for very small angles. 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin \alpha \approx \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

And the approximation is better the smaller the angle is.  This ''only works if we choose Radians as our unit of measure'' and small angles.  


{{ExampleRobox|title=Worked Example: Small angles in Radians and Degrees}}

We claim that for small angles measured in radians the angle measure and the sine of the angle are very similar.

Let us take one millionth of a circle.  In degrees that is 0.00036 degrees.  In Radians that is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{2\pi}{1,000,000} \approx 0.00000628 &lt;/math&gt; Radians.  The angle of course is the same.  It's one millionth of a circle, however we choose to measure it. It is just as with weights where a weight is the same whether we measure it in kilogrammes or pounds.

The sine of this angle, which is the same value whether we chose to measure the angle in degrees or in radians, it turns out, is about 0.00000628.  If your calculator is set to use degrees then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin 0.00036^\circ&lt;/math&gt; will give you this answer.

==The Radian Measure==

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;b&gt;There are&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; Radians&lt;br&gt;
in a complete circle.&lt;/b&gt;

It is traditional to measure angles in degrees; there are 360 degrees in a full revolution.  In mathematically more advanced work we use a different unit, the [[w:radian|radian]].  This makes no fundamental difference, any more than the laws of physics change if you measure lengths in metres rather than inches.  In advanced work, '''If no unit is given on an angle measure, the angle is assumed to be in radians.'''

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;\frac{3\pi}{2}^{c} \equiv \frac{3\pi}{2} \;\mathrm{rad.} \equiv \frac{3\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

A notation used to make it really clear that an angle is being measured in radians is to write 'radians' or just 'rad' after the angle.  Very very occasionally you might see a superscript c written above the angle in question.  

===What You need to Know===

For book one of trigonometry you need to know how to convert from degrees to radians and from radians to degrees.  You also need to become familiar with frequently seen angles which you know in terms of degrees, such as &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; in terms of radians as well (it's &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; Radians).  Angles in Radians are nearly always written in terms of multiples of Pi.

You will also need to be familiar with switching your calculator between degrees and radians mode.

Everything that is said about angles in degrees, such as that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees has an equivalent in Radians.  The angles in a triangle add up to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \pi&lt;/math&gt; Radians.

====Defining a radian====

A single radian is defined as the angle formed in the minor sector of a circle, where the minor arc length is the same as the radius of the circle.

[[Image:Define_a_radian.png|frame|center|Defining a radian with respect to the unit circle.]]



&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1 rad \approx 57.296^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

====Measuring an angle in radians====
The size of an angle, in radians, is the length of the circle arc ''s'' divided by the circle radius ''r''.   

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{angle in radians} = \frac sr&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Radians_Angle_Definition.svg|center|thumb|150px|Measuring an Angle in Radians]]

We know the circumference of a circle to be equal to &lt;math&gt;2 \pi r&lt;/math&gt;, and it follows that a central angle of one full counterclockwise revolution gives an arc length (or circumference) of &lt;math&gt;s = 2 \pi r&lt;/math&gt;. Thus 2 &amp;pi; radians corresponds to 360&amp;deg;, that is, there are &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians in a circle.

==Converting between Radians and Degrees==
Because there are 2&amp;pi; radians in a circle:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0 auto 1em auto;border:2px solid blue; text-align:center;width:40%;&quot;&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;To convert degrees to radians:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \theta ^{c} = \theta^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 0 auto 0 auto;border:2px solid blue; text-align:center;width:40%;&quot;&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;To convert radians to degrees:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \phi ^\circ= \phi^{c} \times \frac{180}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The normal cell cycle consists of 2 major stages.  The first is interphase, during which the cell lives and grows larger.  The second is Mitotic Phase.
Interphase is composed of three subphases.  G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase (first gap), S phase (synthesis), and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase (second gap). The interphase is the growth of the cell.  The normal cell functions of creating proteins and organelles.
The Mitotic Phase is composed of Mitosis and Cytokinesis. [[Cell Biology/Cell division/Mitosis|Mitosis]], when the cell divides. Mitosis can be further divided into multiple phases.  Cytokinesis, which is when the two daughter cells complete their separation.  Mitosis is the division of the nucleus and cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm. There is some overlap between there two sub phases.
Reproductive cell division is called meiosis, which yields a nonidentical daughter cells that have only one set of chromosomes. In other words, they have half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis occurs in gonads, ovaries or testes. Therefore combining two gametes together produce 46 chromosomes. 

==From Wikipedia==
The '''cell cycle''' is the cycle of a biological cell, starting from the time it is first formed from a dividing parent cell until its own division into two cells, consisting of repeated mitotic cell division and interphase (the growth phase). A cell spends the overwhelming majority of its time in the interphase(about 90% of time).

==Background Information==
DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, consists of four nucleic acids, A, T, C, and G.  In a cell, the DNA provides the directions for creating all of the proteins necessary for cell viability, health, growth, function, and replication.  The unique DNA sequence that encodes each protein is called a gene, and the complete set of genes for an organism or cell is referred to as it's genome.  Prokaryotic genomes are often a single long DNA molecule, and Eukaryotic genomes consist of number of DNA molecules. A typical human cell has about 2 m of DNA, which is 250,000 times greater than the cell's diameter.  Before a cell divides the DNA is first copied then separated so that each daughter cell ends up with a complete genome. 
Chromosomes are the packaged DNA molecules. Because of chromosomes, the replication and distribution of so much DNA is manageable. Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. They contain two sets of each chromosome: one set inherited from each parent. For example human somatic cells (all body cells except the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes; the reproductive cells, gametes, have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells. The number of chromosomes in somatic cells varies widely among species. Eukaryotic chromosomes are made of chromatin that is a complex of DNA and associated protein molecules. Each single chromosome contains one very long, linear DNA molecule that carries several hundred to a few thousand genes; the associated proteins maintain the structure of the chromosome and help control the gene activity. 
When a cell is not dividing, each chromosome is a long thins chromatic fiber; however after DNA duplication chromosomes condense. Each chromatin fiber coils and folds. Each duplicated chromosome has two sister chromatids, containing an identical DNA molecule, initially attached along adhesive protein complex; such attachment is called sister chromatid cohesion. In condensed form of chromosome, a center narrow part is called centromere, a specialized region where the two chromatids are closely attached. The other part of a chromatid on either side of the centromere is referred as arm. Once the sister chromatids separate, they are considered individual chromosomes.

== Overview ==
[[File:cell_cycle.png|right|frame|Schematic of the cell cycle. I=Interphase, M=Mitosis. The duration of mitosis in relation to the other phases has been exaggerated in this diagram.]]

Mitotic phase includes both mitosis and cytokinesis which is usually the shortest part of the cell cycle. 
Interphase accounts about 90%of the cycle; during interphase the cell grows and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Interphase is divided into sub phases: G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase (&quot;first gap&quot;), the S phase (&quot;synthesis&quot;), and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase (&quot;second gap&quot;). The chromosomes are duplicated only during the S phase. During G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase cell grows until S phase where the cell prepares for the cell division during G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase. Based from human cell, M phase only takes about 1 hour while the S phase occupy about 10-12 hours.

The cell cycle consists of
*'''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase''', the first growth phase
*'''S phase''', during which the DNA is replicated, where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA.
*'''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase''' is the second growth phase, also the preparation phase for the
*'''M phase''' or [[Cell Biology/Cell division/Mitosis|mitosis]] and [[Cell Biology/Cell division/Mitosis#Cytokinesis|cytokinesis]], the actual [[Cell Biology/Cell division|division]] of the cell into two daughter cells
The cell cycle stops at several checkpoints and can only proceed if certain conditions are met, for example, if the cell has reached a certain diameter. Some cells, such as neurons, never divide once they become locked in a '''G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase'''.

==Mitosis==
Mitosis has five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 
Mitotic spindle starts to form in the cytoplasm during prophase. it is made of microtubules and other associated proteins. while the mitotic spindle assembles, the microtubules of the cytoskeleton disassemble, providing the material used to construct the spindle. In animal cells, the assembly of spindle microtubules starts at the centrosome, the microtubule-organizing center. In plant cells, the centrioles are not present.
During interphase in animal cells, the single centrosome replicates; the two centrosomes remain together near the nucleus and they move apart during prophase and prometaphase of mitosis as spindle microtubules grows. The two centrosomes are located at the opposite end of the cell. Then aster, a radial array of short microtubules, extends from each centrosome. Kinetochore is a structure of proteins associated with specific sections of chromosomal DNA at the centromere. Each of the two sister chromatids of a replicated chromosome contains kinetochore as it face in opposite direction. During prometaphase, kinetochore microtubules form as come of the spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores. After the microtubuels are attached to chromosome's kinetochores, the chromosome begins to move towards the pole from which those microtubules extend. the chromosomes moves in a motion like a tug-of-war. Metaphase plate is the imaginary plane that formed during metaphase the centromeres of all the duplicated chromosomes are on the plane midway between the spindle's two poles. The other microtubules that did not attach to kinetochores overlap and interact with other nonkinetochore microtubules from the opposite pole. The nonkinetochore microtubules are responsible for elongating the whole cell during anaphase. During anaphase, the cohesins holding the sister chromatids of each chromosome are cleaved by enzymes. Then the chromatids separated, and they move towards the opposite ends of the cell. The region of overlap is reduced as motor proteins attached to the microtubules move away from one another, using ATP. As the microtubules push apart from each other, their spindle poles are pushed apart, elongating the cell. As the duplicate groups of chromosomes arrive at the opposite ends of the elongated parent cell, the telophase begins; during telophase nuclei reforms and cytokinesis begins.

*'''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of Interphase''':During G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase, a nuclear envelope bounds the nucleus, and two centrosomes forms by replication of a single centrosome. In animal cells, each centrosome contains two centrioles. The chromosomes are duplicated during S phase but cannot be seen since they are not condensed yet. 
*'''Prophase''': the chromatin fibers coils and dense into chromosomes and the nucleoli disappear. Each duplicated chromosome has tow identical sister chromatids joined at their centromeres along with their arms by cohesins, then the mitotic spindle form. The asters are the radial arrays of shorter microtubules that extend from the centrosomes. Propelled by the lengthening microtubules, the centrosomes move away from each other. 
*'''Prometaphase''': As the nuclear envelope fragments, the microtubules extending from each centrosome invade the nuclear area. the chromosome become more condensed as each of the two chromatids of each chromosome has a kinetochore. Some of the microtubules attach to the kinetochores (&quot;kinetochore microtubules&quot; and other nonkinetochore microtubules interact with each from fromt he opposite pole of the spindle. 
*'''Metaphase''': Metaphse is the longest stage of mitosis. The centrosomes are placed at the opposite poles of the cell. The chromosomes' centromeres lie ont he metaphse plate as the chromosome convene on the metaphase plate. Each kinetochores of the sister chromatids are attacged to kinetochore microtubules coming from opposite poles.
*'''Anaphase''': Anaphase is the shortest stage of mitosis, and begins whent he cohesin proteins are cleaved, allowing the two sister chromatids of each pair to part suddenly. The two liberated daughter chromosomes moves towards oppostie ends of the cell as the kinetochore microtubules shorten. The cell starts to elongate and nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen. By the end of anaphase, the two ends of the cell have equivalent collections of chromosome. 
*'''Telophse''': Two daughter nuclei form in the cell, and nuclear envelopes arise fromt he fragments of the parent cell's nuclear envelope. As nucleoli reappear, the chromosome become less condensed, and completes the division of the one nucleus into two genetically identical nuclei. 
*'''Cytokinesis''': In animal cells, cytokinesis involves formation of cleavage furrow; in plante cell the cleavage furrow does not exist. The formation of cell wall in the middle of cell (cell plate) divides the cell into two daughter cells.

== Details of mitosis ==
[[File:interphase_mitosis.png|frame|left|Schematic of interphase (brown) and mitosis (yellow).]]

{{BookCat}}

== Cytokinesis==
The cytokinesis process begins with cleavage. Cleavage furrow, a shallow groove in the cell surface near the old metaphase plate, is the first sign of cleavage. As it process, contractile ring of actin microfilaments form on the cytoplasmic side. The actin microfilaments interact with the myosin molecules, and cause the ring to contract. As the cleavage furrow deepens, the cell is separated into two with its own nucleus. For plant cells, there is no cleavage furrow because they have the cell walls. Instead of forming cleavages, vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the middle of the cells, and forms cell plate. As the cell plate enlarges, and surrounding membrane fuses with the plasma membrane along the perimeter of the cell and from two daughter cells.

==Binary Fission==
Binary fission is a method of asexual reproduction by &quot;division in half&quot;. In prokaryotes, binary fission does not involve mitosis, but in single celled eukaryotes that undergo binary fission. In bacteria, motst genes are carried on a single bacterial chromosome that consists of a circular DNA molecule and associated proteins. The chromosome of the bacterium Escherichia coli, is 500 times as long as the cell when it is sctreched out. At the origin of replication, DNA of the bacterial chromosome begins to replicate. As the chromosome continues to replicate, one origin moves rapidly toward the opposite end of the cell, and the cell elongates. When the replication is complete the bacterium is about twice its initial size, and its plasma membrane grows inward, dividing the parent E. coli cell into two daughter cells. Bacteria don’t have mitotic spindles; the two origins of replication end up at opposite ends of the cell or in some other very specific location. 

==The Evolution of Mitosis==
Since the prokaryotes were on Earth more than a billion years than eukaryotes that mitosis had its origins in simpler prokaryotic mechanism of the cell reproduction can be assumed. Some of the proteins involved in bacterial binary fission are related to eukaryotic proteins that function in mitosis. Possible hypothesis of evolution of mitosis is that prokaryotic cell's reproduction gave rise to mitosis. 


==The Cell Cycle Control System==
Based from mammalian cell grow experiment, possible hypothesis was supported: the cell cycle is driven by specific signaling molecules present in the cytoplasm. In this experiment two cells in different phase of the cell cycle were fused to form a single cell with two nuclei. One cell was in the S phase and the other was in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nucleus immediately entered the S phase, as though stimulated by chemicals present in the cytoplasm of the first cell. Therefore, if a cell undergoing mitosis (M phase) was fused with another cell in any stage of its cell cycle, the second nucleus enteres mitosis. Other experiments on animal cells and yeasts demonstrates the sequential events of the cell cycle control system; the cell cycle control system operates set of molecules in the cell that both triggers and coordinates key events in the cell cycles. The cell cycle control system proceeds on its own, but it is regulated at certain checkpoints by internal and external signals. Animal cells have built-in stop signals that halt the cell cycle at checkpoints until they get go-ahead signals. The signals report whether crucial cellular processes that should have occurred by that point have in fact been completed correctly and thus whether or not the cell cycle should proceed. The three check points are in G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and M phase. 
For mammalian cells, G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; check points are the most important. When a cell receives a go-ahead signal at the G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; checkpoint, the cell complete the G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and M phases and divide; however when a cell does not get a go-ahead signal, it will exit the cycle and enter non dividing state, G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase. Most of human cells are in G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; phase, such as mature nerve cells and muscle cells. However the liver cells can re-enter the cycle by external signals such as growth factor released during injury. 
Rhythmic fluctuations in the abundance and activity of cell cycle control molecules pase the sequential events of the cell cycle. The regulatory molecules are portins of two types: protein kinases and cyclins. Portin kinases are enzymes that activate or inactivate other proteins by phosphorylating. The protein kinases give the go-ahead signals at the G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; checkpoints. The kinases that drive the cell cycle are present at a constant concentration in the growing cell, but they are in an inactive form. In order to activate them, kinase must be attached to a cyclin, a protein that cyclically fluctuating concentration in the cell. Because of such requirement, these are called cyclin-dependent kinases or Cdks. The activity of cdks rises and falls with changes in the concentration of its cyclin partner. The cylclin level rises during the S and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phases and then falls rapidly during M phase. MPF, the maturation -promoting factor, or M-phase -promoting factor, activity corresponds to the peaks of cyclin concentration. MPF triggers the cell's passage past the G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; checkpoint into M phase. MPF acts both directly as a kinase and indirectly by activating other kinases.
During anaphase, MPF hels switch itself off by initiating a process that leads to the destruction of its own cyclin. The Cdk, noncyclin part of MPF, persists in the cell in inactive form until it associates with new cyclin molecules synthesized during the S and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase of the next round of the cycle.
Density-dependent inhibition is a phenomenon in which crowded cells stop dividing. It is caused by external physical factor. Also most animal cells exhibit anchorage dependence; in order to divide, the cells must be attached to a substratum; like a cell density, anchorage is signaled to the cell cycle control system via pathways involving plasma membrane proteins and elements of cytoskeleton linked to them. The loss of cell cycle controls leads to cancer cells, which exhibit neither density-dependent inhibition nor anchorage dependence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Meiosis''' is a special type of cell division that is designed to produce gametes.  Before meiosis occurs, the cell will be double diploid and have a pair of each chromosome, the same as before mitosis.  

Meiosis consists of 2 cell divisions, and results in four cells.  The first division is when genetic crossover occurs and the traits on the chromosomes are shuffled.  The cell will perform a normal prophase, then enter metaphase during which it begins the crossover, then proceed normally through anaphase and telophase.

The first division produces two normal diploid cells, however the process is not complete.  The cell will prepare for another division and enter a second prophase.  During the second metaphase, the chromosome pairs are separated so that each new cell will get half the normal genes.  The cell division will continue thorough anaphase and telophase, and the nuclei will reassemble.  The result of the divisions will be 4 haploid gamete cells.

==Crossover==
Crossover is the process by which two chromosomes paired up during prophase I of meiosis exchange a distal portion of their DNA. Crossover occurs when two chromosomes, normally two homologous instances of the same chromosome, break and connect to each other's ends. If they break at the same locus, this merely results in an exchange of genes. This is the normal way in which crossover occurs. If they break at different loci, the result is a duplication of genes on one chromosome and a deletion on the other. If they break on opposite sides of the centromere, this results in one chromosome being lost during cell division. 

Any pair of homologous chromosomes may be expected to cross over three or four times during meiosis. This aids evolution by increasing independent assortment, and reducing the genetic linkage between genes on the same chromosome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mitosis is the normal type of cell division.  Before the cells can divide, the chromosomes will have duplicated and the cell will have twice the normal set of genes.

The first step of cell division is '''prophase''', during which the nucleus dissolves and the chromosomes begin migration to the midline of the cell.  (Some biology textbooks insert a phase called &quot;prometaphase&quot; at this point.)The second step, known as '''metaphase''', occurs when all the chromosomes are aligned in pairs along the midline of the cell.  As the cell enters '''anaphase''', the chromatids, which form the chromosomes, will separate and drift toward opposite poles of the cell.  As the separated chromatids, now termed chromosomes, reach the poles, the cell will enter '''telophase''' and nuclei will start to reform.  The process of mitosis ends after the nuclei have reformed and the cell membrane begins to separate the cell into two daughter cells, during '''cytokinesis'''.
[[Image:Major events in mitosis.svg|right|thumb|350px|Mitosis divides genetic information during cell division.]] 

The mitotic phase which includes both mitosis and cytokinesis is the shortest part of the cell cycle. The interphase cycle accounts for about 90% of the cell cycle. This phase is where the cell grows and copies its chromosomes in preparation for cell division. In the G1 phase which is also called the “first gap” the cell grows as it copies its chromosomes. In S phase, the cell starts to synthesize the DNA and completes preparation for cell division. In G2 it starts to divide.

In biology, Mitosis is the process of chromosome segregation and nuclear division that follows replication of the genetic material in eukaryotic cells. This process assures that each daughter nucleus receives a complete copy of the organism's genetic material. In most eukaryotes, mitosis is accompanied with cell division or cytokinesis, but there are many exceptions, for instance among fungi. There is another process called meiosis, in which the daughter nuclei receive half the chromosomes of the parent, which is involved in gamete formation and other similar processes, which makes the parent cell still active.

Mitosis is divided into several stages, with the remainder of the cell's growth cycle considered interphase. Properly speaking, a typical cell cycle involves a series of stages: G1, the first growth phase; S, where the genetic material is duplicated; G2, the second growth phase; and M, where the nucleus divides through mitosis. Mitosis is divided into prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. 

The whole procedure is very similar among most eukaryotes, with only minor variations. As prokaryotes lack a nucleus and only have a single chromosome with no centromere, they cannot be properly said to undergo mitosis.

==Prophase ==

[[Image:ProphaseSH.png|200px|thumb]]

The genetic material (DNA), which normally exists in the form of chromatin condenses into a highly ordered structure called a chromosome. Since the genetic material has been duplicated, there are two identical copies of each chromosome in the cell. Identical chromosomes (called sister chromosomes) are attached to each other at a DNA element present on every chromosome called the centromere. When chromosomes are paired up and attached, each individual chromosome in the pair is called a chromatid, while the whole unit (confusingly) is called a chromosome. Just to be even more confusing, when the chromatids separate, they are no longer called chromatids, but are called chromosomes again. The task of mitosis is to assure that one copy of each sister chromatid - and only one copy - goes to each daughter cell after cell division. 

The other important piece of hardware in mitosis is the centriole, which serves as a sort of anchor. During prophase, the two centrioles - which replicate independently of mitosis - begin recruiting microtubules (which may be thought of as cellular ropes or poles) and forming a mitotic spindle between them. By increasing the length of the spindle (growing the microtubules), the centrioles push apart to opposite ends of the cell nucleus. It should be noted that many eukaryotes, for instance plants, lack centrioles although the basic process is still similar.

==Prometaphase ==

[[Image:InterphaseSH.png|thumb|300px]]

Some biology texts do not include this phase, considering it a part of prophase. In this phase, the nuclear membrane dissolves in some eukaryotes, reforming later once mitosis is complete. This is called open mitosis, found in most multicellular forms. Many protists undergo closed mitosis, in which the nuclear membrane persists throughout. 

Now kinetochores begin to form at the centromeres. This is a complex structure that may be thought of as an 'eyelet' for the microtubule 'rope' - it is the attaching point by which chromosomes may be secured. The kinetochore is an enormously complex structure that is not yet fully understood. Two kinetochores form on each chromosome - one for each chromatid. 

When the spindle grows to sufficient length, the microtubules begin searching for kinetochores to attach to.

==Metaphase ==

[[Image:metaphaseSH.png|thumb|300px]]
As microtubules find and attach to kinetochores, they begin to line up in the middle of the cell. Proper segragation requires that every kinetochore be attached to a microtubule before separation begins. It is thought that unattached kinetochores control this process by generating a signal - the mitotic spindle checkpoint - that tells the cell to wait before proceeding to anaphase. There are many theories as to how this is accomplished, some of them involving the generation of tension when both microtubules are attached to the kinetochore. 

When chromosomes are bivalently attached - when both kinetochores are attached to microtubules emanating from each centriole - they line up in the middle of the spindle, forming what is called the metaphase plate. This does not occur in every organism - in some cases chromosomes move back and forth between the centrioles randomly, only roughly lining up along the midline.

==Anaphase== 

[[Image:AnaphaseSH.png|thumb|250px]]

Anaphase is the stage of meiosis or mitosis when chromosomes separate and move to opposite poles of the cell (opposite ends of the nuclear spindle). Centromeres are broken and chromatids rip apart. 

When every kinetochore is attached to a microtubule and the chromosomes have lined up along the middle of the spindle, the cell proceeds to anaphase. This is divided into two phases. First, the proteins that bind the sister chromatids together are cloven, allowing them to separate. They are pulled apart by the microtubules, towards the respective centrioles to which they are attached. Next, the spindle axis elongates, driving the centrioles (and the set of chromosomes to which they are attached) apart to opposite ends of the cell. These two stages are sometimes called 'early' and 'late' anaphase. 

At the end of anaphase, the cell has succeeded in separating identical copies of the genetic material into two distinct populations.

==Telophase ==

[[Image:TelophaseSH.png|thumb|200px]]

The nonkinetochore microtubules elongate the cell and try to cut the cell in two. The nuclear envelopes start to become created by fragments of the parents cell’s nuclear envelope. Then, the chromatids start to become less tightly coiled together. By this point, cytokinesis is fully under way.

==Cytokinesis==
Cytokinesis refers to the physical division of one eukaryotic cell. Cytokinesis generally follows the replication of the cell's chromosomes, usually mitotically, but sometimes meiotically. Except for some special cases, the amount of cytoplasm in each daughter cell is the same. In animal cells, the cell membrane forms a cleavage furrow and pinches apart like a balloon. In plant cells, a cell plate forms, which becomes the new cell wall separating the daughters. Various patterns occur in other groups.


In plant cells, cytokinesis is followed through by the usage of contracting ring of microfilaments that pull the cleavage furrow within itself, cutting the cell in two. In plant cells, vesicles from the Golgi apparatus start to form a cell plate within the center of the cell. When this cell plate solidifies and connects the two ends of the cell, a new cell wall is created and two daughter cells are produced.

[[Image:cyto.png|thumb|center|800px|alt=The difference between Cytokinesis for animal and plant cells.]]

==Regulation of Cell Cycle==

Protein kinases are enzymes that activate or inactivate other proteins by phosphorylating them. These give out the signals for the G1 and G2 checkpoints to occur. However, to be active, the kinase must be attached to a cyclin. This is why it is called a CDK or a cyclin-dependent kinase.

Internal kinetochores exhibit a wait function.  Not until all kinetochores are attached to a spindle microtubule does the cell process starts. This helps prevent some chromosomes from being left behind. Density dependent inhibition is when cells have a cue to multiply until a certain level of density is fulfilled. This means that a cell keeps multiplying until there is a full layer or until a certain level of pressure is built upon each other.

One possible explanation of why cancer cells do not follow normal signals is because they have an abnormality in the signaling pathway that conveys the growth factor’s signal to the cell-cycle control system. Usually, a cell will follow normal checkpoints due to the release of CDK in the system that regulate the cell process. However, in a cancer cell, the checkpoints are random. This means that because the cell does not follow density-dependent inhibition or follow the growth signals, the cell replicates at random points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About the platform==

MS-DOS was Microsoft's first Operating System.  It was built upon QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), which was based on Gary Kildall's CP/M.  The original MS-DOS was simplistic and very difficult to use for the untrained.  As time progressed, the interface remained essentially the same (keyboard on a text console), however it had some significant usability features (e.g. DOSKey) implemented as well.  Microsoft retained the crown of most used DOS until it usurped its own OS with Windows, however there were other non Microsoft versions of DOS as well.  DR-DOS was the primary non MS-DOS and did fairly well until Windows 95 arrived.  Afterwards, most people abandoned the non-GUI DOS system.  A few diehards survived, however, and some have produced a version of DOS written under an Open Source license known as FreeDOS.  Although abandoned by its &quot;creator&quot;, DOS is still a stable and viable operating system, although it has been overshadowed by Windows and the most popular open source operating system, Linux.

DOS is still occasionally used on boot disks, so system recovery software may sometimes be written for DOS.

The most popular languages for use on the DOS platform, besides DOS batch files and Intel x86 [[Assembly Language]], are [[Programming:C|C]] and [[Programming:BASIC|BASIC]].

See [[QEMU/FreeDOS]] and [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems/DOS]] for more information about FreeDOS.

==C/C++ Compilers==

The main compiler for 32-bit DOS is DJGPP ( http://www.delorie.com/djgpp ).  Nevertheless, 16 bit programs make up a substantial amount of the pre-Windows 95 program set, and so you may need to find a 16 bit compiler if you want to program on extremely old computers.

For the most part however, one can just use a 32 bit DOS extender, such as CWSDPMI.

==Batch files==

DOS allows the use of [[Windows Batch Scripting|batch files]], which are a collection or &quot;batch&quot; of DOS prompt commands stored in a file.  When a user types in the filename (with or without the extension) of a batch file, DOS will perform each command listed in the .bat file, then return control to DOS.

==Assembly Language==

DOS comes with a low-level debugger called '''DEBUG'''.  This allows debugging of an executable program which it loads into memory along with DEBUG.  This is done by running DEBUG ''program'' at the DOS prompt, where ''program'' is the name of your program.  DEBUG will work with .com and .exe executables.  You must include the file extension in the filename when you call it using DEBUG.  DEBUG does not work with .bat files.

DEBUG can also be run without a file to view CPU register contents, memory, and to assemble machine instructions directly into memory.  A brief walkthrough of how to run DEBUG to view and change memory and registers, as well as assemble and run some basic machine instructions can be viewed [http://asmfloat.blogspot.com/2010/08/dos-redeemed.html here].

&quot;Maybe it would be a good idea create an entire book about databases and reference that as a requirement for learning SQL..&quot;
:I agree. The same would also go for having a book about [[Computer Programming]] as a prerequisite for learning [[C++ Programming|C++]]. [[User:Noldoaran|Noldoaran]] 03:21, 17 Dec 2003 (UTC)
::See [[Computer Programming/Database Programming|Programming:Database Programming]]. --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 23:41, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

You need to introduce language elements in their properly defined categories (DDL / DML/ DCL).  Also, the section on relational database history is out of place.  If you're going to talk about databases in general, put that section BEFORE any information on SQL itself, so that you can introduce SQL in that context.  Also, you might consider removing the references to the term &quot;relational&quot;, since many would argue that SQL DBMSs certainly are not.
: Done. I left &quot;relational&quot; though as SQL is about relational (in the math sense) databases although maybe not about &quot;relational in the strict sense of Codds 12 rules&quot; (which probably nobody I personally know has ever read :)). Or where are the violations?  --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 00:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== SQL Syntax? ==

Should SQL keywords like SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, ect be in all capitals in the examples?  Some of them are, while others are in all lowercase.  I feel as though this would make the syntax more readable and it is pretty much standard to do so anyway. --Nick Manley 03:10, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
: Definetly yes! --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 06:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

== Should we drop all these empty sections? ==

I suggest we gank all the empty sections.  In the beginning, we just should just accumulate as much SQL-related material as we can, and then later try to organize it.
: No empty sections visible? Already removed? --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 00:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== DBMS's ==
We should also mention IMB DB2 and MS SQL Server since these are also two major DBMS's
--[[User:Doc0tis|Nathan]] 21:35, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
: Done. --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 00:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== Factual Error? ==
Is text actually a SQL standard datatype?? --[[User:Doc0tis|Nathan]] 21:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

I did some major revisions on the JOINS secion. I hope to continue and complete these changes --[[User:Doc0tis|Nathan]] 20:35, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

I changed an error in the &quot;ADDING DATA&quot; section it was quantiy now it quantiy_available to match the code in the table creation. Also I note when I SELECT * FROM fruit; I get 1's in the second column. after checking the mysql reference it is probably due to not specifying the &quot;precision and the scale&quot; http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/numeric-types.html I'm not sure if this is common with most kinds of SQL as I am just learning but... perhaps a note should be made --[[User:xenoterracide|Caleb]] Wed May 24 20:42:40 EDT 2006

I reordered the introduction so that it now goes from Databases -&gt; Relational Databases -&gt; SQL -&gt; SQL servers. The language commands were tried to be grouped into DDL and DML to make it easier for other people to find the right point for additions. --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 00:11, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== From IP talk page ==

I think that the assertion that SQL is &quot;a method for specifying the means of requesting data...&quot; is convoluted and incorrect.  SQL isn't a method: it's a language.  SQL also doesn't specify the ''means'', or how to accomplish the task  Rather, it specifies the ''ends'': the desired or expected result of the operation.  I added a more descriptive definition of SQL as a declarative language to further clarify this point.

I also removed the paragraph that incorrectly stated that SQL is ''non-programmable''.  Of course SQL is programmable, since it is after all a database programming language.  I think the original author may have confused this term with ''non-procedural'', which has quite a different meaning.  In any case, I added a reference to the characteristics of procedural database languages to further clarify how the contrast between SQL as a declarative language.  Further expansion of this topic could be useful to show the steps to perform a query using dBase/xBase code vs. SQL.

I also think the term ''metadata'' shouldn't be used without a definition or reference to its meaning, since it isn't a term that readers should be expected to know.

Introducing foreign keys without first discussing primary keys is not a very good idea.  Foreign key specifications won't work without primary keys, so the CREATE TABLE example with the REFERENCES clause wouldn't ever work.  Creating tables without primary keys is also a very bad example.  I also noticed that primary keys are being used later in the examples, but with no prior description of them.

(thanks for moving my comments here - I'm a Wikibooks newbie).

== Expansion of SQL description ==

I added several examples of simple SQL commands to give the reader a quick overview of what SQL syntax actually looks like in practice.  I also expanded the discussion of how SQL is used in context with other languages, with a brief introduction to two tier client/server processing and middleware libraries.  Additional examples showing SQL used within these other language contexts might be useful, however it's probably time to create additional pages to go into these details.

== printable version problem ==

The queries example are in scroll panes on the printable version, they should be in regular wrappable cells.  Please feel free to MOVE this notice to some other page but the problem should be addressed and I'd like to know where it should be.  --[[User:DynV|DynV]] 00:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)


== Comment on proposed merging MySQL implementations into this book ==
I would recommend against discussing any relational database implementation syntaxes. It tends to become a black whole of comparisons, or separate segments of a chapter that would be better served as a separate version of the text. This book seems to focus squarely on the subject of the general concepts that are consistent the SQL standards, thus should be to all implementations. My feeling is that it is best to learn the standard then go on to learn implementation, of which I now have implemented projects on MySQL, Oracle &amp; SQL Server. The MySQL book is developing on it's own. Merging MySQL has two problems, first it would make it more difficult for those trying find content only for MySQL and second it would make this book loose focus on what is common between all implementations of SQL. Compounding this is merging MySQL indicate content on Oracle, DB2, and SQL Server all need to be added since all three have larger market shares than MySQL (at least as of 2005).

== Extensions ==
I have plans to create some more pages for our book during spring and summer 2012. You can find a first draft of TOC at [[User:Kelti/sandbox|my sandbox]]. Comments desired!

As I'm not a native English speaking person, I like to get your support concerning accurate phrasing. You may write directly into my sandbox. --[[User:Kelti|Kelti]] ([[User talk:Kelti|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelti|contribs]]) 12:45, 19 March 2012 (UTC)
:Good news. I have several advices for you :)
:* [[w:SQL:2011|SQL:2011]] has been published three months ago. You have the chance to write documentation for this latest specification instead of the [[w:SQL:2008|SQL:2008]] specification.
:* I think you'd rather add your pages one by one directly in the final location instead of writing your pages in a sandbox. Each time a page is finished, you can add the page in the summary. The documentation would be improved in real time. If someone modifies an existing page, you won't have to merge the content. And you know ''&quot;Motivation lack always strikes when it shouldn't&quot;'' :) To be sure your work will be merged one day, merge your work constantly.
:Good contributions. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 20:18, 22 March 2012 (UTC)

I have finished the first block of five additional pages and will integrate them to the book mid of May. Please review them (content and my poor english phrasing) by correcting the text directly in my sandbox and give me feedback in discussion pages. Here is the link: [[User:Kelti/sandbox]] --[[User:Kelti|Kelti]] ([[User talk:Kelti|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelti|contribs]]) 10:02, 9 May 2012 (UTC)
: OK. [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 01:07, 11 May 2012 (UTC)



== Further Extensions ==
I plan to merge the book at end of 2013 with the content of my [[User:Kelti/sandbox|sandbox]] and its subpages. There are ten new pages, which overlaps in form and content with existing pages. As my work is not finished I leave the old pages 'as is'. In the new version preliminary there will be two tracks: the 'classic track' with the unchanged, actual pages and the new 'evolving track' with the new pages. I/we shall move the classic track to the evolving track, so that it gets superfluous one day.

Some more comments:
* I use a new data model with 4 tables. I think this one is easierer to understand and at the same time an example of all possible relationships: 1:n and n:m.
* I have tested all statements against MySQL and Oracle. If possible, please test against MS SQL Server, db2 and postgres.
* The new pages focus on textual explanations, examples and exercises. The SQL syntax is of course also presented, but is not a priority.
* Please review the new pages (content and especially my poor english phrasing) by correcting the text directly in my sandbox.

The '''Russian Wikibook''' is a collaborative effort to create a comprehensive textbook for learners of the Russian language. Russian is an East Slavic language, related to [[Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian]], and is spoken by over 270 million people worldwide. This book includes four sections: a main text curriculum, a grammar supplement, an appendix, and a vocabulary. The main text guides the student through the lessons and provides everything to understand the texts that are to be understood. The grammar supplement provides a greater detail into the concepts presented in the lessons. The appendix is there to refer to for usage and other miscellaneous concepts. The vocabulary groups words into concept-based sections for studying.

=Draft 1=
Following is a draft outline of the planned Vietnamese Wikibook. These planned articles are pitifully out of order &amp;ndash; I'd like them to be ordered by difficulty, and have one lead into the other, like an academic course would.

'''Note:''' ''This list has been modified and placed in a [[Vietnamese: Contents|Table of Contents]].''

I plan to use some of the content on [http://www.1ec5.org/mingerweb/viet/index.html Học với Tôi], one of my websites, in this textbook.

----

=Draft 2=

This time, I'm going to aim at a more structured plan. The current Vietnamese book will be split into three levels, according to difficulty and amount of usage. Each book will have a goal (preliminary goals are stated below).

Each book &amp;ndash; often more than once within the book &amp;ndash; the same topic is repeated. Each time it is repeated, it is either a review, or a deeper look at the topic.

In the end, I'd like each chapter to have a title in Vietnamese, at least three exercises (or should the goal be two exercises until the next draft?), and 

This plan '''won't take effect until the current book gets a decent amount of lessons started''' (half of them?). It'll probably also require that someone else helps me out.

I'm basing this plan on the experience I've had for three years so far, learning Spanish. If you have any questions, reservations, doubts, clarifications needed, comments, compliments, or flames &amp;ndash; just kidding &amp;ndash; feel free to respond on this page's Talk Page.

==Level 1: Chào!==
This book will get you started. It will focus on basic phrases, vocabulary, and structure. By the end, you should know enough to visit a Vietnamese community (not necessary in Vietnam) for a day and be able to minimally communicate with the people there.

===Introduction===
*About the authors
*History: do we really need this at the intro level, or can we have this as a cultural note later on?
*Pros &amp;amp; cons

===The Basics===
The essential stuff that you need to know before you begin with vocabulary and grammar. Lessons:

*Alphabet
**Consonants
**Vowels
*Tones: just an introduction to tones and tone marks; we'll build on this lesson extensively later on
*Numbers (single-digit)
*Colors

===Chào!===
Starting a conversation by introducing yourself. Lessons:

*Greetings
*Introducing yourself
*Saying goodbye

Cultural note:
:The handshake: taking a look at shaking hands with others, as opposed to the tradition of bowing

===Tôi Là... (?)===
Describing yourself.

*Age
**Numbers (double-digit)
*Physical characteristics (height, build, hair, facial characteristics)
*Clothes: just enough to describe someone (red shirt, blue jeans, white cap)
*Nationality

...

===Cái Gì?===
Asking questions. Lessons:

*Interrogative pronouns (question words)

...

==Level 2: Hàng Ngày==
This intermediate-level book will expand on the vocabulary and structures introduced in Level 1. It will focus on everyday situations and tasks. By the end, you should be able to spend a few weeks (is that too much?) in Vietnam, communicating with the people around you.

===Phòng Ngủ===
The bedroom.

===Phòng Tắm===
(Or should we call it Phòng Cầu Tiêu?) The bathroom, its fixtures, toiletries, and so on.

*Fixtures
*Toiletries &amp;amp; associated actions

===Phòng Bếp===
The kitchen.

*Appliances &amp;amp; associated actions

===Ngon Lắm!===
Learning about Vietnamese food. This is basically a cultural chapter (but it, of course, has tons of vocabulary), and an extension of possible cultural notes that could appear well before here.

*Rice dishes
*Soup
*Sandwiches
*Snacks
*Beverages

This section should be so good that everyone who takes a course using this book should look forward to this section in particular. This would be a good opportunity for an instructor using this course to take the students on a field trip to a Vietnamese restaurant

Cultural note: We'll take a look at how the Vietnamese typically do not assign specific dishes to certain meals during the day (for example, eating ''phở'' or ''cháo'' (porridge) for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner).

===Nhà Hàng===
Eating at the restaurant. (Or could we call it ''Tiệm ăn''?)

*Ordering food
*Payment: we'll likely introduce the money topic earlier on

This recipe is for an entire '''Thanksgiving Dinner''' that takes one hour to cook.  The recipe uses various pre-cooked ingredients and instant foods, and is designed for those cooking Thanksgiving dinner for the first time, such as college students.

== Ingredients ==

*1 5&amp;ndash;6 lb fully pre-cooked smoked [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] breast.   Certain brands are readily available in almost every U.S. supermarket, however they must be fully-cooked frozen turkey breast, as they only require 1 hour of heating.   Avoid processed turkey breast loaf. 
*2 cans of desired vegetables. 
*1&amp;ndash;2 box package(s) of instant potatoes or stuffing.
*1 package of 12 instant frozen [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuit]]s.  The frozen home-baked butter variety works best.  It is important that the biscuits in a can are not used.
*1 package of turkey gravy mix. 
*1 small disposable aluminum turkey pan with built-in rack. 
*1 can of spray oil (can be substituted with regular vegetable oil). 

=== Optional ===

*1 pre-made [[Cookbook:Pumpkin Pie|pumpkin pie]].  
*1&amp;ndash;2 cans [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|cranberry sauce]]. 
==Procedure==
#Make sure you have thawed the turkey breast. A frozen 5&amp;ndash;6 pound breast thaws within one day in the refrigerator. It is also very important that you have purchased a frozen fully pre-cooked breast. The words &quot;heat and serve&quot; may be on the package.
#Preheat your oven to 350°F.
#Remove turkey from bag and place in aluminum roasting pan.
#Spray the turkey with cooking oil. If using regular vegetable oil, rub the breast with it.
#Place turkey breast in the oven on the middle rack.
#Cook for 15 minutes.
#Begin the gravy mix according to package directions.
#Place the vegetables on the range set to low heat.
#Prepare the instant potatoes or stuffing according to the package directions.
#On a small pan lay out your frozen biscuits allowing them to touch one another. At this point the turkey breast should have been cooking for 30 minutes.
#Place your biscuits on the lower rack. The biscuits will cook just fine with the turkey in the oven and will be ready in 25&amp;ndash;30 minutes. Check them at 20 minutes to be sure they do not burn.   
#Finish preparing your instant potatoes or stuffing, instant gravy, and vegetables. Place them in serving dishes if desired. Place the cranberry sauce in a serving dish. If you are serving pie along with the dinner you will also need to place the pie on a serving dish. If a frozen pie has been purchased, follow the microwave directions.
#At the end of the hour, remove the turkey. It is recommended that you use a food thermometer to make sure it has achieved a temperature of 160°F &amp;mdash; the minimum temperature necessary to kill any bacteria which have survived the freezing process. Remove the turkey and serve.

This dinner serves 6&amp;ndash;8 people comfortably.

== Leftovers ==

There are many uses for the leftover turkey.  Sliced turkey leftovers can be used to make sandwiches or [[Cookbook:Turkey Biscuit|turkey biscuits]].

The portion along the bone can be used to prepare turkey soup by placing it in a soup pot along with 4 cups of water, 1 chopped onion, 2 tablespoons salt, and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and allow to simmer for 2 hours.  Add another cup of water, spices to taste, desired vegetables such as carrots or potatoes, and noodles. Simmer for an additional hour and a half.

==Helpful vocabulary for asking about words==
When you're trying to find the right word, these can help you ask for suggestions:
* same &amp;rarr; sama
* almost the same &amp;rarr; hampir sama / mirip
* antonym &amp;rarr; lawan kata

If you forget these, you can fall back on: 
* sinonim &amp;rarr; synonym
* antonim &amp;rarr; antonym
''Sinonim'' and ''antonim'' are not common words, but they are easy to remember, many Indonesian speakers understand them, and they can be helpful in your early stages of trying to communicate.

''Articles &quot;rescued&quot; from VfD at Wikipedia, to be sorted at a later time if found useful''

== SAUCES ==

===Common Sauce===

From the 1881 Household Cyclopedia 

Soak slices of veal, ham, onions, parsnips, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 heads of cloves, then add broth, a glass of white wine, and 2 slices of lemon; simmer it over a slow fire, skim it well, and sift it.

===Parson's sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Chop lemon-peel very fine, with 2 or 3 pickled cucumbers, a bit of butter, salt, and coarse pepper, a little flour, with 2 spoonful of catsup, and stew it on the fire without boiling. 

===Nonpareil sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Take a slice of boiled ham, as much breast of roasted fowl, a pickled cucumber, a hard yolk of an egg, one anchovy, a little parsley, and a bend of shallot, chopped very fine; boil it a moment in good catsup, and use it for meat or fish. 

===Gravy cakes===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Chop 2 legs of beef in pieces, put them into a pot of water, stew it over a slow fire a day and a night; then add onions, herbs, and spices as for gravy; continue stewing it till the meat is off the bones, and the gravy quite out; then strain the liquor into a milk-pan, to which quantity it should be reduced; when cold, take off the fat, put it into a saucepan, and add whatever is required to flavor it; simmer it on a slow fire till reduced to about 12 saucers twothirds full, put them in an airy place till as dry as leather, put them in paper bags, and keep in a dry place. 

===Sailor's sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Chop a fowl's liver with a or 3 shallots, and a couple of truffles or mushrooms; simmer these in a spoonful of oil, 2 or 3 spoonful of gravy, a glass of wine, a little salt and coarse pepper, simmer it about half an hour, and skim it very well before using. 

===Queen's sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Simmer crumbs of bread in good gravy, until it is quite thick, take it off the fire, and add a few sweet almonds pounded, 2 hard yolks of eggs, and a breast of fowl roasted, all pounded very fine; boil a sufficient quantity of cream to your sauce, and sift all together, then add pepper and salt, and warm it without boiling.

===Catsup for sea-stores===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Take a gallon of strong stale beer, a pound of anchovies washed from the pickle, the same of shallots peeled, 1/2 an ounce of mace, 1/2 an ounce of cloves, 1/4 of an ounce of whole pepper 3 or 4 large races of ginger, and 2 quarts of large mushroom flaps, rubbed to pieces. Cover these close, and let it simmer till half wasted. Then strain it through a flannel bag; let it stand till quite cold, and then bottle it. This may be carried to any part of the world; and a spoonful of it to a pound of fresh butter melted, will make a fine fish sauce, or will supply the place of gravy sauce. The stronger and staler the beer the better will be the catsup. 

''Another'' -- Chop 24 anchovies, having first boned them; put to them 10 shallots cut small, and a handful of scraped horse-radish, 1/4 of an ounce of mace, a quart of white wine, a pint of water, and the same quantity of red wine, a lemon cut into slices, 1/2 a pint of anchovy liquor, 12 cloves, and the same number of peppercorns. Boil them together till it comes to a quart, then strain it off cover it close, and keep it in a cold dry place. Two spoonful of it will be sufficient for a pound of better. It is a good sauce for boiled fowls, or, in the room of gravy lowering it with hot water, and thickening it with a piece of butter rolled in flour. 

===Cream sauce for a hare===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Run the cream over the hare or venison just before frothing it, and catch it in a dish; boil it up with the yolks of two eggs, some onion, and a piece of butter rolled in flour and salt. Half a pint of cream is the proportion for two eggs. 

===Sweet sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Mix 2 glasses of red wine, one of vinegar, 3 teaspoonful of cullis, a bit of sugar, 1 sliced onion, a little cinnamon, and a laurel-leaf; boil them a quarter of an hour. 

===Brown sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Mix together one tablespoonful of moist sugar, two of French vinegar, three of salad oil, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, some pepper and salt, end serve.

==ELEMENTS OF ART-INTRODUCTION==

===Audience (who the book is for)===

Students, producers and consumers of diverse forms of art, including but not limited to painting, drawing and sculpture, who would like to know more about the elements and theory of their specific art and art in general. This book is also for those who have an interest in the history of art. It will be richly illustrated, so that the facts and concepts it contains will be comprehended by children and adults, and be within their interest levels.

===Purpose (why it might be used)===

Elements of Art is designed to be used as a reference book. It is also a teaching book, to be consulted with other and more advanced/specialised resources on the subject, including textbooks that people may already be using. It can be a 'cram book' for examinations and tests, or a 'coffee table' book to take to the museum, library or keep at home.

===Form (the shape of the book)===

Chapters explaining (describing, analysing) the form, content and structure of particular elements of art, as well as general concepts reinforced throughout the book, and at the end of a section. Generally they are designed to build upon one another.

Thus, there are chapters about line, colour, dimensionality (2-D forms of art like drawing and painting, and 3-D like sculpture) and shape.

==General Questions about Art (five Ws and a H-hopefully will be answered throughout the book, by clicking on specific links)==

==LINE==

===What is line?===

In art, line is the continuous movement of a mark from dot to dot.

==Different lines==
===Lines of direction===
====Horizontal====

Horizontal lines travel from left to right and are relative to the horizon.

====Vertical====

Vertical lines travel up and down.

====Diagonal====

Diagonal lines go in two directions.

One kind of diagonal line goes down from left to right.
Starting from the right, it can also go up to the left.

===Lines of length===

====Short lines====

====Long lines====

===Lines of thickness===

The thickness or thinness of a line can be affected by using different materials. A ballpoint pen will create a thinner line than a big marker.

====Thick lines====

====Thin lines====

==Putting lines together==

There are many ways to put lines together.

One of the simplest is to join a horizontal and a vertical line. A square is two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.

Many lines can be put together to make a shading effect. An example of this is cross-hatching, where many small horizontal lines are put over many small vertical lines. This gives a realistic effect.

==Effect of lines==

===Lines of movement===

===Lines of emotion===

Horizontal lines can represent calmness and tranquility whereas vertical lines tend to have more of a grandeur effect. Curved lines tend to represent nature as well as confusion and busyness. 

Diagonal lines represent movement.

Thick lines can represent anger whereas thin lines can represent shyness, or invisibility.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 15. Magnoliophyta (I)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
----

The '''Division Magnoliophyta''' in the Kingdom Plantae comprises those species of plants that were formerly classified as '''angiosperms''' and are known widely as the ''flowering plants''. You have already studied flowers ([[Botany/Plant_reproduction|Chapter 4]]), so now understand that the Division Magnoliophyta comprises all those species of plants that have flowers. For perspective: all of the plants we have read about in '''Section II''' of the ''Botany Study Guide'' up to this point do not have flowers, but certainly do have reproductive structures. We also know that flowers are the reproductive structures of the plants that bear them, and that reproductive structures are not limited to flowering plants. Thus, &quot;flowers&quot; are  structures that distinguish plants in the Division Magnoliophyta from plants in the other divisions of the Kingdom Plantae. Observe a flower, and you know you are examining an angiosperm. However, not all angiosperms have obvious, showy flowers. You will need to consider that the structure of a flower is quite variable across all the many species of angiosperms (about a quarter million have been identified) and a few flowering plants actually seldom flower.  However, angiosperm botanists put great stock in the structure of flowers as a way of classifying plants&amp;mdash;more than any other part of a plant, the flower provides the basis for placement of a species in subtaxa (classes, orders, and families) of the Division Magnoliophyta.   

The Division Magnoliophyta is split into two large classes: the '''Magnoliopsida''' and the '''Liliopsida'''.

* Read [[w:en:Flowering plant|Flowering plants]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included&lt;/small&gt;)
** Reread [[w:en:Cotyledon|cotyledon article]]
** Read [[w:en:Dicotyledon|dicotyledons]] (Magnoliopsida)
** Read [[w:en:Monocotyledon|monocotyledons]] (Liliopsida)
** Read [[w:en:How to distinguish a monocot from a dicot|How to distinguish monocots and dicots]] &lt;small&gt;and follow any links that you are uncertain about&lt;/small&gt;

There are over 300 families and 250,000 species of flowering plants.  The remainder of this chapter will be concerned with the dicotyledonous angiosperms ('''Class Magnoliopsida'''), leaving the monocotyledonous angiosperms to be covered in the [[Botany/Liliopsida|next chapter]].  

==Flower evolution==
Conifers are pollinated by wind, meaning they must produce a large amount of pollen grains for only a few to arrive at the female megaspore, resulting in fertilization. An advancement that allowed for higher rates of fertilization per energy expended in making pollen would surely result in that new plant type being prolific and even dominant. However, a single mutation would never result in a flower adequately adapted to spread pollen using animals. Flowers are the result of a special kind of evolution called [[w:en: co-evolution| co-evolution]].

If plants reproduced and thrived with wind pollination, why did flowers evolve? 

Suppose one wind pollinated plant began to have its' pollen eaten by an animal, for example a beetle. Then suppose the beetle spreads the pollen from the male cones to the female cones while looking for pollen because it can't tell the difference between the male and female cones; it searches both, spreading pollen from the male to the female in doing so. This plant has an advantage over all wind pollinated plants, because of a higher rate of fertilization. Any mutation that leads to pollen being spread by an animal soon becomes prevalent within a species, because the plant pollinated by an animal is more efficient. The plant and the animal rely on each other, one for food, the other for reproduction. Any mutation in the animal that helps pollinate the plant will become prolific through natural selection, just as mutations that favor feeding the insect or making the insect come to the flower will be dominant. This back and forth evolution results in such seemingly improbable structures as flowers that look like female moths that are pollinated by amorous male moths, or flowers and bird beaks that complement the feeding of the bird and the pollination of the flowers.

== Class Magnoliopsida (dicots) ==
Members of the Class Magnoliopsida are defined partly on the basis of the seed or seedling having two cotyledons, most obvious at germination. But the differences between dicots and monocots are many, and we will be able to recognize most flowering plants that we encounter as belonging to one or the other class without having to dissect the seed or observe the seedling.

==SHAPE==

Shapes are created with lines in a given space, either real or imaginary. Shapes can be endlessly rotated. There can be organic shapes or geometric shapes.

==Different shapes==

===Circle===

A circle is a shape with only one side created from a single, continuously curved line which encompasses the whole of the shape.

===Triangle===

A triangle is a shape comprised of three straight lines which meet at three endpoints - the bottom side is horizontal, and the other two sides are diagonal, meeting each other at a point.

===Square===

A square is a shape which is made of four straight lines which intersect at four points at 90 degree angles: the top and bottom lines are parallel to one another, as are the two lines comprising the sides of the square. In a square, each of the sides is the exact length of the other sides (a rectangle is a different shape where the opposing sides are equal in length; thus, all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.)

===Pentagon===

A shape with 5 sides. The bottom side is horizontal, there are two vertical sides that are parallel and the two top sides are diagonal.

A common use of the pentagon is to draw a house.

===Hexagon===

A shape with six sides. 4 sides are diagonal and 2 are horizontal.

===Star===

==Three-dimensional shapes==

===Cone===

===Cube=== 
A cube has 8 endpoints, 12 edges and 6 faces.  At every endpoint 3 lines intersect, and at an intersection any two edges are perpendicular to each other.  Finally every edge has the same length.

==Putting shapes together==

Most shapes in art are combinations of the shapes described above. They may be expressed (that is, they have a clear outline) or implied (the viewer has to seem them for his/herself).

Also, different shapes can be put together for interesting results.

===Rotating shapes===

==Effects of shapes==

===Movement===

===Emotion===

===Weight===

===Height===

==Two and Three Dimensions==


Dimensions, in art, can create some really interesting effects.

They are connected with perspective, which is often used in graphic design, especially one-point perspective and two-point perspective.

====Two dimensions====

The two dimensions are height and width.

====Three dimensions====

The three dimensions are height and width and depth. Depth is often applied by projecting a shadow. Three-dimensional shapes can often be created by extra lines, or by doing a net.

===Art forms that use two dimensions===

Drawing
Painting

===Art forms that use three dimensions===

Sculpture Origami

===Art forms that use two and three dimensions===

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GeneralChemTOC}}

The fundamental properties that we use to measure matter in are; Inertia, Mass, Weight, Volume, Density and Specific Gravity. The [[Periodic Table|periodic table]] is a visual method of interpreting the chemical properties of elements which effect the measurements below.

These measurements can be classified into two categories, intrinsic and extrinsic.  

==Extrinsic Properties==

Extrinsic properties (also called extensive), such as volume and weight, are directly related to the amount of material being measured.

* [[wikipedia:Inertia|Inertia]] - the resistance of an object to changes in motion ([[Wikipedia:Sir_Isaac_Newton|Newton's]] first law).
** Measured as mass because it is intimately related to mass.  Mass has inertia by virtue of its nature.
** Common units: kilograms (kg), grams (g), pounds (lb).
** Fundamental property of matter.

* [[wikipedia:Mass|Mass]] - a) the amount of matter in an object; b) a measure of resistance to acceleration that an object has.
** Common units; [[wikipedia:kilograms|kilograms]] (kg), grams(g), pounds (lb), ounces (oz).
** Sometimes equated with weight, but only valid when the acceleration due to [[wikipedia:Gravity|gravity]] is understood to be 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., earthly conditions), or when a different definition of the word &quot;weight&quot; is used, as is normal in commerce and the medical sciences.

* Weight:
# Mass times the acceleration of gravity.
# Note that Weight is very different from Mass, a common misconception for students. However, weight and mass are related. An easy way to remember the difference is that no matter what planet you are on, you will always be the same mass. However, if you enter a different planet or go on the moon, your '''weight''' will change.
# The measure of the attraction between two objects, one of which is generally much larger than the other.
# Common units: newtons (N), pounds-force (lbf), ounces-force (ozf).

* Force:
** Common units: pounds-force (lbf) or newtons (N).
** Relevant equation(s):
**# '''''F''''' = ''m'' '''''a''''' ( Force = Mass * acceleration )
**# '''''W''''' = ''m'' '''''g''''' ( Weight = Mass * Gravity )
**# '''N''' = 1 kg &lt;b&gt;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ( newtons = kilograms * meters per second squared )
** Notes: The acceleration of gravity near the surface of the earth is 9.81 meters per second squared or 9.81 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

* [[wikipedia:Volume|Volume]] - the amount of space that an object occupies.
** Common units: liters (l), cubic meters (m&amp;sup3;), cubic feet (ft&amp;sup3;), fluid ounces, pints, quarts, gallons.

==Intrinsic Properties==

Intrinsic properties (also called intensive) are those which are independent of the quantity of matter present. For example, the density of gold is the same no matter how much gold you have to measure.  Common intrinsic properties are density and specific gravity.

* [[wikipedia:Density|Density]] - units of mass per unit of volume.
** Common units: g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
** Relevant equation(s):
**# ''D'' = ''m''/''v ( Density = mass/volume )
** These measurements are relative to temperature. The density of water (at 4 degrees Celsius) is 1.00 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Above and below that temperature, the density will be slightly different.

* [[wikipedia:Specific_Gravity|Specific Gravity]] - ratio of a substance's density relative to the density of water.  Usually table values use a water temperature of 25 degrees Celsius. See current reference books for examples. 
** Since specific gravity is a ratio with the same numerator as denominator, it has no units.
** Specific gravity is usually measured with a hydrometer.
** Specific gravity can be an ambiguous measurement if the temperatures of the two substances are different.

* [[wikipedia:Specific_Heat|Specific Heat]] - the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a pure substance by one degree Kelvin. 
** Common units J/(g*K) (Joules per gram-Kelvin).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Dbroadwell, welcome to Wikibooks. Just a tip: Please try and keep a relative [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]] when you add content (for example you can't really &quot;plug&quot; Python without considering alternatives or criticisms of Python, for example).

Thanks, and keep contributing! :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:00, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

You may be interested to know that you can make subpages of your user page, for example, you may want to make a sandbox, so you might create [[User:Dbroadwell/Sandbox]], or [[User:Dbroadwell/Grape seed oil]], and when you're done with them you can request an admin to delete them :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:36, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dbroadwell. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dbroadwell~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== ... が好きです ==
'''''... ga suki desu'''''

Expresses that a thing or person is liked.
The subject, marked by が, is liked by the person marked with the topic marker は (if mentioned).

=== Examples ===
:彼はリンゴとバナナが好きです
:''kare wa ringo to banana ga suki desu.''
:He likes apples and bananas.

:英語を勉強するのがとても好きだよ！
:''eigo o benkyo suru no ga totemo suki da yo!''
:I really like studying English!

== ... なければならない ==
'''''... nakereba naranai'''''

The construction &quot;(verb stem)なければならない&quot;, ''-nakereba naranai'' is used to express an obligation: something that has to be done.

(Literally, the -なければ ''-nakereba'' conjunction is the negative conditional form, &quot;if not (this action)&quot;; ならない ''naranai'' is &quot;to not become&quot;, the plain negative of なる ''naru''. The literal implication is that if the action is not done, nothing else can proceed.)

=== Examples ===
:今日は銀行にいかなければならない。
:''kyô wa ginko ni ikanakereba naranai.''
:I have to go to the bank today.

:おじいさんがすぐに帰らなければ、私はマクドナルドに行きます。
:''Ojii-san ga suguni kaeranakereba watashi wa makudonarudo ni ikimasu.''
:If Grandpa doesn't return soon, I'm going to McDonald's.

Since ならない ''naranai'' is the plain-form negative of the verb なる ''naru'' (to become), in a more formal or polite situation one would use the polite negative form なりません ''narimasen'' instead.

== 下手の横好き（へたのよこずき） ==
'''''heta no yoko-zuki'''''

An idiom meaning that you are &quot;unskilled but enthusiastic&quot; or &quot;crazy about it, but not very good at it&quot;. Used about a hobby or skilled activity.

=== Example ===
:山田： 田中さんは英語がお上手ですね。
:''Yamada：Tanaka-san wa eigo ga ojouzu desune.''
:Yamada: Mr Tanaka, you speak English well.

:田中： いいえ、下手の横好きなんですよ。
:''Tanaka: iie, heta no yoko-zuki nandesuyo.''
:Tanaka: Oh no, I like it, but I'm not very good at it

The term algae is used to collectively refer to a wide range (20,000-30,000 spp.) of very simple photosynthetic organisms. While this term is no longer used as a taxonomic grouping, it is still useful for referring informally to these photosynthetic protists. (Protists are diverse eukaryotes which are neither fungi, animals nor plants.)

The earliest multicellular alga known is the red fossil alga Bangiomorpha (at right), found in 1,200 million year old rocks in Arctic Canada. What's more this is the first known organism to show sexual reproduction.== Chapter 9. Phycology ~ The Algae ==
The '''algae''' (singular: '''alga''') comprise several different groups of plant-like organisms, some of which are (and some are not) regarded as members of the Kingdom Plantae. All algae lack true leaves, roots, flowers, and other structures found in the higher plants. They are distinguished from bacteria and protozoa mainly in that they are autotrophic, obtaining energy through photosynthesis. Although no longer considered a natural group, the term ''algae'' is still used for convenience. The botanical discipline concerned with the study of algae is called '''Phycology''' (or sometimes, Algology); and the environments most phycologists (or algologists) focus on are the marine intertidal/shallow subtidal regions of the world oceans. It is in these environments that the diversity of structurally complex algae (called '''seaweeds''') reaches its pinnacle. 

[[Image:Seaweed (Westerland).jpg|thumb|right]]
As a grouping, the algae cut across even the prokaryote/eukaryote divide: the so-called &quot;Blue-green algae&quot; are cyanobacteria.  All other algae are eukaryotes. Green Algae (different from Blue-green algae) are considered to be the ancestors of green plants. Other kinds of algae on the other hand are distinct from green plants and from each other in having different and unrelated accessory pigments. These pigments are responsible for the ways different algae absorb light, providing advantage to each individual type of alga to compete best at a water depth where its preferred wavelength is perhaps strongest.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Alga|Algae]]

== Cyanobacteria ==

The cyanobacteria comprise the structurally simplest algae, and presumably are closely related to the oldest photosynthetic organisms on the planet. Although capable of extracting energy from sunlight through photosynthesis, these algae are related to bacteria as evidenced by their prokaryotic cell structure. Yet, some Blue-greens have developed multi-cellular thalli that approach eukaryotic algal forms, and thus their traditional inclusion within the &quot;algae.&quot;   

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria]]

''Questions''

8.1 How do we know that the different algae are not monophyletic?

8.2 What do the different algae have in common that they are grouped together as algae?

8.3 What are 3 similarities between the green algae and green plants?

8.4 Define endosymbiosis. Did photosynthetic cyanobacteria exist before or after photosynthetic organelles? Why or why not?

==Primes and Modular Arithmetic==

===Factorisation Exercises===

Factorise the following numbers. (note: I know you didn't have to, this is just for those who are curious)

#&lt;math&gt;13 = 13 \cdot 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;26 = 13 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;59 = 59 \cdot 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;82 = 41 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;101 = 101 \cdot 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;121 = 11 \cdot 11&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2187 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3&lt;/math&gt;

===Recursive Factorisation Exercises===

Factorise using recursion.

#&lt;math&gt;45 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;4050 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2187 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3&lt;/math&gt;

===Prime Sieve Exercises===

#Use the above result to quickly work out the numbers that still need to be crossed out in the table below, knowing 5 is the next prime:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
X &amp; 2_p &amp; 3_p &amp; X &amp; 5 &amp;X &amp;7&amp; X&amp; X&amp; X \\
11 &amp; X &amp; 13 &amp; X&amp; X&amp; X&amp;17 &amp;X&amp; 19&amp; X\\
X&amp; X&amp; 23 &amp; X&amp; 25 &amp;X&amp;X&amp;X&amp;29&amp; X\\
31 &amp;X&amp; X&amp; X&amp; 35 &amp;X&amp;37&amp; X&amp; X&amp; X\\
41 &amp; X&amp; 43 &amp; X&amp; X&amp;X&amp;47&amp; X&amp; 49&amp; X\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:The next prime number is 5. Because 5 is an unmarked prime number, and 5 * 5 = 25, cross out 25. Also, 7 is an unmarked prime number, and 5 * 7 = 35, so cross off 35. However, 5 * 11 = 55, which is too high, so mark 5 as prime ad move on to 7. The only number low enough to be marked off is 7 * 7, which equals 35. You can go no higher.

2. Find all primes below 200.

:The method will not be outlined here, as it is too long. However, all primes below 200 are:

2      3      5      7     11     13     17     19     23     29 
31     37     41     43     47     53     59     61     67     71 
73     79     83     89     97    101    103    107    109    113 
127    131    137    139    149    151    157    163    167    173 
179    181    191    193    197    199

===Modular Arithmetic Exercises===

#&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-5)\mod{11} = 5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 7 \mod{11} = 21 = 10&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16 = 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2^5 = 32 = 10, 2^6 = 64 = 9, 2^7 = 128 = 7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2^8 = 256 = 3, 2^9 = 512 = 6, 2^{10} = 1024 = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;An easier list: 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6, 1</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">My original intention was for this chapter to be reserved for the ''hard'' exercises listed in &quot;Problem Set&quot; section of each chapter, not the easy exercises. You might like to provide solutions only to questions that appear in the &quot;Problem Set&quot; section of each chapter, so that this chapter is not bloated. 
Your efforts are appreciated. I have created a new section called Solutions to Exercises, the solutions you provided will be moved there.[[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo Jia Dai]] 8:20, 20 Dec 03</text>

===Factorisation Exercises===

Factorise the following numbers. (note: I know you didn't have to, this is just for those who are curious)

#13 is prime
#&lt;math&gt;26 = 13 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;
#59 is prime
#&lt;math&gt;82 = 41 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;
#101 is prime
#&lt;math&gt;121 = 11 \cdot 11&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2187 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3&lt;/math&gt;

===Recursive Factorisation Exercises===

Factorise using recursion.

#&lt;math&gt;45 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;4050 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2187 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3&lt;/math&gt;

===Prime Sieve Exercises===

#Use the above result to quickly work out the numbers that still need to be crossed out in the table below, knowing 5 is the next prime:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
X &amp; 2_p &amp; 3_p &amp; X &amp; 5 &amp;X &amp;7&amp; X&amp; X&amp; X \\
11 &amp; X &amp; 13 &amp; X&amp; X&amp; X&amp;17 &amp;X&amp; 19&amp; X\\
X&amp; X&amp; 23 &amp; X&amp; 25 &amp;X&amp;X&amp;X&amp;29&amp; X\\
31 &amp;X&amp; X&amp; X&amp; 35 &amp;X&amp;37&amp; X&amp; X&amp; X\\
41 &amp; X&amp; 43 &amp; X&amp; X&amp;X&amp;47&amp; X&amp; 49&amp; X\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:The next prime number is 5. Because 5 is an unmarked prime number, and 5 * 5 = 25, cross out 25. Also, 7 is an unmarked prime number, and 5 * 7 = 35, so cross off 35. However, 5 * 11 = 55, which is too high, so mark 5 as prime ad move on to 7. The only number low enough to be marked off is 7 * 7, which equals 49. You can go no higher.

2. Find all primes below 200.

===Modular Arithmetic Exercises===

#&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-5)\mod{11} = 5&lt;/math&gt;alternatively, -1 = 10, -5 = 6: 10 &amp;times; 6 = 60 = 5&amp;times 11 + 5 = 5
#&lt;math&gt;3 \cdot 7 \mod{11} = 21 = 10&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16 = 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2^5 = 32 = 10, 2^6 = 64 = 9, 2^7 = 128 = 7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt; 2^8 = 256 = 3, 2^9 = 512 = 6, 2^{10} = 1024 = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easier list: 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6, 1 &lt;br/&gt; Notice that it is not necessary to actually &lt;br/&gt;compute &lt;math&gt;2^{10}&lt;/math&gt; to find &lt;math&gt;2^{10}&lt;/math&gt; mod 11.  &lt;br/&gt;If you know &lt;math&gt;2^9&lt;/math&gt; mod 11 = 6.  &lt;br/&gt;You can find &lt;math&gt;2^{10}&lt;/math&gt; mod 11 = (2*(&lt;math&gt;2^9&lt;/math&gt; mod 11)) mod 11 = 2*6 mod 11 = 12 mod 11 = 1.  &lt;br/&gt; We can note that 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 6 and 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, we can calculate 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; easily: 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; = 2^8 = 3. OR by the above method &lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;6^1 = 6, 6^2 = 36 = 3, 6^3 = 6*3 = 18 = 7, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;6^4 = 6*7 = 42 = 9, 6^5 = 6*9 = 54 = 10, 6^6 = 6*10 = 60 = 5, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;math&gt;6^7 = 6*5 = 30 = 8, 6^8 = 6*8 = 48 = 4, 6^9 = 6*4 = 24 = 2, 6^{10} = 6*2 = 12 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easier list: 6, 3, 7, 9, 10, 5, 8, 4, 2, 1.
#0&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4, 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9,&lt;br/&gt; 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 = 5, 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25 = 5, 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 36 = 3, 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 49 = 3,&lt;br/&gt; 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 = 9, 9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 81 = 4, 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 100 = 1&lt;br/&gt;An easier list: 0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 4, 1&lt;br/&gt;Thus&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4}=2\mbox{ and }\sqrt{4}=9&lt;/math&gt;
#x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -2 = 9&lt;br/&gt;Just look at the list above and you'll see that&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-2}=8\mbox{ and }\sqrt{-2}=3&lt;/math&gt;

===Division and Inverses Exercises===

1.
:&lt;math&gt;x = 2^{-1} = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 3^{-1} = 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 4^{-1} = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 5^{-1} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 6^{-1} = 6&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 7^{-1} = 0^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; therefore the inverse does not exist

2. &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \ \ \mbox{(mod 29)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;7^{-1}  = 25 \ \ \mbox{(mod 29)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 28\cdot 25 = 4 \ \ \mbox{(mod 29)}&lt;/math&gt;

3.
:&lt;math&gt;x = 5^{99} \times (40 + \frac{1}{3})  \ \ \mbox{(mod 11)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 5^{99} \times (40 + 4)  \ \ \mbox{(mod 11)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 5^{99} \times 0  \ \ \mbox{(mod 11)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x =  0  \ \ \mbox{(mod 11)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Question 1===
Show that the divisible-by-3 theorem works for any 3 digits numbers (Hint: Express a 3 digit number as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b and c are ≥ 0 and &lt; 10)

Solution 1
Any 3 digits integer ''x'' can be expressed as follows
:x = 100a + 10b + c
where a, b and c are positive integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
Now
:&lt;math&gt;
x \equiv 100a + 10b + c \equiv a + b + c \pmod{3}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
x \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if a + b + c = 3k for some k. But a, b and c are the digits of x.

===Question 2===
&quot;A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.&quot; True or false? Determine whether 89, 558, 51858, and 41857 are divisible by 9. Check your answers.

Solution 2
The statement is true and can be proven as in question 1.

===Question 4===
The prime sieve has been applied to the table of numbers above. Notice that every number situated directly below 2 and 5 are crossed out. Construct a rectangular grid of numbers running from 1 to 60 so that after the prime sieve has been performed on it, all numbers situated directly below 3 and 5 are crossed out. What is the width of the grid?

Solution 4
The width of the grid should be 15 or a multiple of it.

=== Question 6 ===
Show that n - 1 has itself as an inverse modulo n.

Solution 6
:(n - 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 2n + 1 = 1 (mod n)
Alternatively
:(n - 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 (mod n)

===Question 7===
Show that 10 does not have an inverse modulo 15.

Solution 7
Suppose 10 does have an inverse ''x'' mod 15,
:10x = 1 (mod 15)
:2&amp;times;5x = 1 (mod 15)
:5x = 8 (mod 15)
:5x = 8 + 15k
for some integer k
:x = 1.6 + 3k
but now ''x'' is not an integer, therefore 10 does not have an inverse</text>

'''General Instructions'''.--The vegetable kingdom affords no food more wholesome, more easily prepared, or less expensive than the potato, yet, although this most useful vegetable is dressed almost every day, in almost every family-for one plate of potatoes that comes to table as it should, ten are spoiled. 

Be careful in your choice of potatoes; no vegetable varies so much in color, size, shape, consistence and flavor. 

Choose those of a large size, free from blemishes, and fresh, and buy them in the mould; they must not be wetted till they are cleaned to be cooked. Protect them from the air and frost by laying them in heaps in a cellar, covering them with mats or burying them in sand or in earth. The action of frost is most destructive, if it be considerable, the life of the vegetable is destroyed, and the potato speedily rots. 

# '''Potatoes boiled'''.--Wash them, but do not pare or cut them unless they are very large; fill a saucepan half full of potatoes of equal size (or make them so by dividing the larger ones), put to them as much cold water as will cover them about an inch: they are sooner boiled, and more savory than when drowned in water; most boiled things are spoiled by having too little water, but potatoes are often spoiled by too much; they must merely be covered, and a little allowed for waste in boiling) so that they may be just covered at the finish. &lt;p&gt;Set them on a moderate fire till they boil, then take them off, and set them by the side of the fire to simmer slowly till they are soft enough to admit a fork (place no dependence on the usual test of their skin cracking, which, if they are boiled fast, will happen to some potatoes when they are not half done, and the inside is quite hard); then pour the water off (if you let the potatoes remain in the water a moment after they are done enough they will become waxy and watery), uncover the saucepan, and set it at such a distance from the fire as will secure it from burning; their superfluous moisture will evaporate, and the potatoes will be perfectly dry and mealy. &lt;p&gt;You may afterwards place a napkin, folded up to the size of the saucepan's diameter, over the potatoes, to keep them hot and mealy till wanted. &lt;p&gt;This method of managing potatoes is in every respect equal to steaming them; and they are dressed in half the time. &lt;p&gt;There is such an infinite variety of sorts and sizes of potatoes, that it is impossible to say how long they will take to cook; the best way is to try them with a fork. Moderate sized potatoes will generally be done in fifteen or twenty minutes. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Cold Potatoes Fried'''.--Put a bit of clean dripping into a fryingpan; when it is melted slice in your potatoes with a little pepper and salt, put them on the fire, keep stirring them; when they are quite hot they are ready. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Boiled and Broiled'''.--Dress your potatoes as before directed, and put them on a gridiron over a very clear and brisk fire; turn them till they are brown all over, and send them up dry, with melted butter in a cup. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Fried in Slices or Shavings'''.--Peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round as you would peel a lemon. Dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping. Take care that your fat and frying pan are quite clean; put the pan on a quick fire, watch it, and as soon as the lard boils, and is still, put in the slices of potatoes, and keep moving them till they are crisp; take them up and lay them to drain on a sieve: send them up with a very little salt sprinkled over them. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Fried Whole'''.-When nearly boiled enough, as directed in No. 1, put them into a stewpan with a bit of butter, or some nice clean beef drippings; shake them about often (for fear of burning them) till they are brown and crisp; drain them from the fat. &lt;p&gt;It will be an improvement to the three last receipts, previously to frying or broiling the potatoes, to flour them and dip them in the yolk of an egg, and then roll them in fine sifted breadcrumbs. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Mashed'''.--When your potatoes are thoroughly boiled, drain dry, pick out every speck, etc., and while hot rub them through a colander into a clean stewpan, to a pound of potatoes put about half an ounce of butter, and a tablespoonful of milk; do not make them too moist; mix them well together. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Mashed with Onions'''.--Prepare some boiled onions, by putting them through a sieve, and mix them with potatoes. In proportioning the onions to the potatoes, you will be guided by your wish to have more or less of their flavor. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Excaloped'''.--Mash potatoes as directed in No. 6, then butter some nice clean scallop shells, or pattypans; put in your potatoes, make them smooth at the top, cross a knife over them, strew a few fine bread-crumbs on them, sprinkle them with a paste brush with a few drops of melted butter, and then set them in a Dutch oven; when they are browned on the top, take them carefully out of the shells, and brown the other side. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Colcannon'''.--Boil potatoes and greens, or spinach, separately; mash the potatoes, squeeze the greens dry, chop them quite fine, and mix them with the potatoes with a little butter, pepper and salt; put it into a mould, greasing it well first; let it stand in a hot oven for ten minutes &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Roasted'''.--Wash and dry your potatoes (all of a size), and put them in a tin Dutch oven, or cheese toaster; take care not to put them too near the fire, or they will get burnt on the outside before they are warmed through. Large potatoes will require two hours to roast them. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potatoes Roasted under Meat'''.--Half boil large potatoes, drain the water from them, and put them into an earthern dish, or small tin pan under meat that is roasting, and baste them with some of the dripping when they are browsed on one side, turn them and brown the other; send them up round the meat, or in a small dish &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potato Balls'''.--Mix mashed potatoes with the yolk of an egg, roll them into balls, flour them, or egg and breadcrumb them, and fry them in clean drippings, or brown them in a Dutch oven. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potato Snow'''.--The potatoes must be free from spots, and the whitest you can pick out; put them on in cold water; when they begin to crack strain the water from them, and put them into a dean stewpan by the side of the fire till they are quite dry and fall to pieces; rub them through a wire sieve on the dish they are to be sent up in and do not disturb them afterwards. &lt;p&gt;
# '''Potato Pie'''.--Peel and slice your potatoes very thin into a pie dish. Between each layer of potatoes put a little chopped onion (three-quarters of an ounce of onion is sufficient for a pound of potatoes), between each layer sprinkle a little pepper and salt, put in a little water and cut about two ounces of fresh butter into little bits and lay it on The top, cover it close with puff paste. It will take about an hour and a half to bake it.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 8. Microbiology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;

==Microbes==

'''Microbes''' are extremely small organisms or quasi-living particles traditionally studied by botanists, but now treated within the more specialized field of '''Microbiology'''. As a specialized field, Microbiology has its own methodologies and terminologies often very different from those used by botanists. Nonetheless, there is value for beginning botany students to learn something of these organisms&amp;mdash;to gain understanding of their presumably more primitive nature and significance as the causes of plant diseases.   
 
==Bacteria==
===Overview===
A '''bacterium''' (plural: bacteria) is a single celled organism belonging to the '''Domain Bacteria''', in the three domain scheme. It can also be a type of organism belonging to one of the three major branches of life. Traditionally classified as one of the five kingdoms, bacteria are microscopic and relatively simple cells, called '''prokaryotes'''. These cells lack the nucleus and organelles of the more complex cells called '''eukaryotes''' that plants are constructed of.  However, like the cells of plants, most bacteria possess a carbohydrate-based cell wall. In common speech, &quot;bacteria&quot; still refers also to archaeabacteria, although the latter recently have been classified as an independent branch or &quot;domain&quot; of life. 

True bacteria are the oldest organisms on Earth, with the possible exception of the Archaea, and they are also the most abundant. Bacteria exist in soil, water, and as parasites of other organisms. Species and strains of bacteria cause many if not most non-hereditary diseases. They are the target of the drugs known as antibiotics.

==Viruses==

===Overview===

A '''virus''' is an obligate cellular parasite that is completely dependent on the host cell for its replication. The genome of the virus may consist of single stranded or double stranded DNA or RNA. The size of viral genomes varies widely and may encode between one and 250 genes. Of most interest within the study of Botany are viruses that are '''plant pathogens'''. The majority of plant viruses have single-stranded, messenger-sense RNA genomes (Class IV) and encode only between one and 12 proteins. These proteins function in virus transmission, in replication, cell-to-cell and systemic movement, in the structure of the virus, and in the suppression of plant host defense mechanisms. In many cases, virus replication takes place in distinct virus-induced regions of the cell, the so-called viroplasms, and induces the synthesis of a pool of virus components followed by assembly of many virus particles from this pool.

Viruses can usually be horizontally transmitted between hosts. In many cases the transmission is dependent on insects, nematodes, fungi or other vectors. However, some other viruses, for example ''Tobacco mosaic virus'' (TMV), are transmitted mechanically by physical contact between plant tissue and virus-contaminated surfaces. Once the virus is transmitted and has successfully entered into the plant cell, it moves locally from cell to cell until it enters the phloem, which allows the virus to enter distant tissue to cause a systemic infection.

Even smaller than viruses are '''viroids''' . Viroids are infectious agents that consist of single-stranded RNA, which does not encode any proteins.

===History===

The first virus to be identified was TMV. A. E. Mayer was a professor at the Agricultural College in Wageningen, the Netherlands that was established in 1876. Soon after he was asked by farmers to investigate a highly contagious disorder in tobacco, which he called ''mosaic disease''. In 1898, M. W. Beijerinck in the Netherlands concluded that the tobacco mosaic disease-causing agent was neither a bacterium nor any corpuscular body, but rather a contagium vivum fluidum, an infectious fluid. The next big step was made in 1935, when TMV was chemically purified by Nobel prizewinner Wendell M. Stanley in the United States. This was followed soon after in 1939 by the first visual observation of the rod shaped TMV particles by '''electron microscopy''' by Kausche, Pfankuch and Ruska in Germany. For a long time electron microscopy remained a main tool in virology, and many viruses were isolated and visualized. The study of the mechanisms of viral infection cycles became more important after '''molecular biology''' tools became available.

Could someone explain to me how to use IRC? Every time I attempt to follow a link, I am met with some sort of error. Thanks, [[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]] 02:01, 25 December 2007 (UTC)
: OK, 4 years too late but it may help others.  In most cases you will need a program like [http://www.mirc.com miRC] to use the IRC.  If you use the [http://www.opera.com Opera] web browser then you can simply click on the link because IRC is included within the web browser.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 13:09, 18 December 2011 (UTC)

5. The antiparticle of the electron (e-) is the positron. What is the charge and rest mass of a positron?

Charge: +1.6 x 10-19C

Mass: 0.511 MeV = 8.176 x 10-14 kg
==================================
Is the rest mass actually the same of that of the electron?:

: &quot;''is trig really considered a subject for *advanced* HS students?''&quot;. This will differ between places and some school systems don't parallel particularly well with the (standard?) US one.  --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

::Most states' high school curriculum, advanced average or basic, typically require up to Algebra II (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II) to be completed. However, all high schools attempt to motivate the kids to take up to Pre-Calculus/Trigonometry and the advanced kids to take Calculus. So, for normal/basic students they would reach Trigonometry. For advanced, they'd reach Calculus. At least, that's how it is in Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan. Probably more states too. --[[User:Mathos|Jaden Mathos]] 04:23, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Problems from a precalculus book ==

[[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] Hey, all. I have a Precalculus textbook at the moment and I noticed that there weren't any problems in this Wikibook. Should I take a few out of the textbook and put them on the page with answers and explanations? I haven't really contributed anything yet and it looks like something I could do. If there's a heads up, I'll go ahead and do it. Thanks!

: Problems are a good idea, but the ones in your book are probably copyrighted. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for details. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

[[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] That's not a problem, I could just change a few of the numbers and alter a few of the situations. They can't have a copyright on the concept, right? I'll go ahead and get started.

: I'd be '''very''' careful here. Textbook authors usually include examples that have proven to work on their students. That involves a lot of work. Let's not show them the disrespect of leaching off their work. Copying them in any way is a violation of their copyright.
: These problems are very simple to make up (I'll help you if you'd like) but if there are a number that look simlar to a book, then we might be in trouble. I recommend you '''not''' to use the book for anything more than glancing through to get ideas. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:40, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

::Very well, Swift. I don't have the book anymore anyways; I'm going to go ahead and think some up right now. I need some help in deciding how to implement the problems though. Should we have a separate page with problems and answers, or add it to the wikibook page?[[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] 00:43, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

::: Depends on the number. There is no need for a seperate page if there will only be a few of them. As the number grows, split the page up by moving them to a seperate page. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:17, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

== Standardized Problems and Solutions ==

Hey all. I just found a great template that I think we should standardize and use for all questions and solutions. The template looks like this:

  |{| class=&quot;navbox collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; border: 0px; margin-top: 0.2em;&quot;
  |-
  ! style=&quot;background-color: #B4CDCD;&quot; | 
  |-
  | style=&quot;border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;&quot; |
  |}

Just disregard the first |; I put that in so that I could put lines around the text. In any event, it looks like a great way to present problems. Here's one I made: 

{| class=&quot;navbox collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; border: 0px; margin-top: 0.2em;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background-color: #B4CDCD;&quot; | Question: Convert &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; into degree form.
|-
| style=&quot;border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;&quot; | '''Solution:''' '''90&amp;deg;'''
|}

(NOTE: To see the way it actually looks on the page, follow this link to my talk page and look at &quot;Template Example&quot;: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Robinson0120)

http://www.december.com/html/spec/color.html has a number of hexadecimal colors to choose from for the question and answer background, too. 

So, what does everybody think? [[User:Robinson0120|Robinson0120]] 03:13, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

: Sure, it looks like a good way to display problems and solutions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:20, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

::Looks fine and all, but having the problem immediately followed by the solution could be very annoying for a student who's actually trying to apply their mind to the problem, the answer waving in their face and all.  I have a statistics self-study book like that, and it's my least favorite of all the math book I've ever used.  In fact, I despise it.  I do think that providing extensive problem sets for each topic is an invaluable addition that we really need to work on.  It's the difference between a sketchy summary and a useful textbook, IMO. --[[User:Fyedernoggersnodden|Fyedernoggersnodden]] 19:20, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

== Front cover created for this book ==

[[Image:OpenTrigonometry.png|thumb|right]]
I'm planning to expand this book quite significantly and then make an actual book from it, which looks like an actual textbook. Here's the front cover, thus far. Careful, the file is gigantic :-P [[User:James.Spudeman|James.Spudeman]] 01:20, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
:I like the idea, but I must comment that (a) this is the same background image being used at the head of the [[Calculus]] wikibook, and (b) while the nautilus is a wonderful and elegant example of the beauty of mathematics, it's doesn't really scream &quot;Trigonometry&quot; to me.  I could, however, go for an illustration of waves (Lots of artistic potential there!) or even, if we must be ordinary, triangles. ''--someone unsigned''
:Well we could overlay a right-triangle spiral ''and'' get some real and imaginary waves, ocean and graphed, onto the cover.  That would be in keeping with the sea shell motif.  All we need now is a talented mathematical artist.[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 12:51, 16 October 2010 (UTC)

== Moving trig out of algebra ==

Is it true that a college algebra book, or high school algebra book, or whatever, has no trig in it?  So, I am new here but I don't understand why this part of the book had to be moved out of an algebra book just because it is trig?  And, I don't understand why the message saying it was removed is in the book and not in the discussion section.  Isn't this what a discussion section is for? [[User:NumberTheorist|NumberTheorist]] ([[User talk:NumberTheorist|talk]]) 17:21, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

: An algebra book may contain a little trigonometry, but doesn't specialize in it (at most, it may just reference ''sin'' as a function).  A book on Trigonometry places a specific focus on the topic, and will include more detailed descriptions of appropriate functions or equations.  (e.g. the law of cosines may not be suitable for a simple algebra book.) --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 15:13, 11 February 2010 (UTC)

== A third book? ==

The intended structure seems to be an elementary book that moves slowly step by step and an advanced book that assumes a knowledge of calculus and complex numbers.  Should there be another book, between or after them, that assumes some sophistication, so can move rapidly, but not the more advanced stuff?  This new book could include the stuff for enthusiasts and the sections I am adding about associated circles, plus material like the formula for sin 18º.--[[User:Wisden|Wisden]] ([[User talk:Wisden|talk]]) 19:09, 4 December 2010 (UTC)

: You could put the various circles and sin 18º in the 'for enthusiasts' section, but if in book one I think you would still have to assume that algebraic manipulations need to be done step by step.  So I guess, yes, I am OK with a third book that takes the algebra a lot faster, but that still does not depend on calculus or complex numbers.  I very much like the core/enthusiasts division within a book so don't want to lose that.  If you want to make a book 'between' 1 and 2, and take some of the enthusiasts pages into it (as enthusiast pages) that is fine.  Delaunay triangulation would certainly belong with the circumcircle page. -- [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 15:08, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

: You might also want to pick up some topics from [[Trigonometry/Teachers_Notes/Khan_Academy_Videos]] (such as polar coordinates) that are not in book 1. -- [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 15:57, 5 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To be able to study Trigonometry successfully, it is recommended that students complete [[Geometry]] and [[Algebra]] prior to digging in to the course material. Students should also be familiar with the arithmetic of the real number system. It is helpful to have a graphing calculator and graph paper on hand to be able to follow along as well. If one is not available, software available on sites such as [http://www.graphcalc.com/ GraphCalc] or [http://www.geogebra.org/cms/ GeoGebra] may be helpful. Geometric constructions proposed in the text can be drawn using [http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/P/PR/PRBRENAN/geops-1.2.pl Geops], free software for performing geometric constructions in the manner of the Ancient Greeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who do we mean when we speak of this person, Shakespeare? 

Shakespeare is William Shakespeare, one of the English-speaking world's greatest playwrights and poets, who possessed a great knowledge of human nature and transformed the English theatre. 

Yet many facts of his life remain a mystery. Some have been acquired from painstaking looks at the records of the time, so that this summary is based on generally agreed facts. It has been said that we only know three things about Shakespeare: that he was born, married and died.

He was baptised on April 26, 1564; we do not know his birth date, but many scholars believe it was April 23, 1564.

His father was John Shakespeare (who was a glover and leather merchant) and his mother Mary Arden (who was a landed local heiress). John had a remarkable run of success as a merchant, alderman, and high bailiff of Stratford, during William's early childhood. His fortunes declined, however, in the late 1570s.

William lived for most of his early life in Stratford-upon-Avon. We do not know exactly when he went to London but he is said to have arrived in 1592.

There is great conjecture about Shakespeare's childhood years, especially regarding his education. It is surmised by scholars that Shakespeare attended the free grammar school in Stratford, which at the time had a reputation to rival that of Eton. While there are no records extant to prove this claim, Shakespeare's knowledge of Latin and Classical Greek would tend to support this theory.  In addition, Shakespeare's first biographer, Nicholas Rowe, wrote that John Shakespeare had placed William &quot;for some time in a free school.&quot; John Shakespeare, as a Stratford official, would have been granted a waiver of tuition for his son. As the records do not exist, we do not know how long William attended the school, but certainly the literary quality of his works suggest a solid education. What is certain is that William Shakespeare never proceeded to university schooling, which has stirred some of the debate concerning the authorship of his works.

In November 28, 1582, when he was 18, he married Anne Hathaway, who was 26. They had a daughter named Susanna, who was baptised on May 26, 1583. Later they had twins, a son named Hamnet and a daughter named Judith. Hamnet died while he was still a child on August 11, 1596. Due to the early death of his only son, Shakespeare does not have any direct descendants.

For the seven years that followed the birth of his twins, William Shakespeare disappeared from all records, and then, turned up again in London some time in 1592. This period, which is known as the &quot;Lost Years,&quot; has sparked as much controversy about Shakespeare's life as any period.

When he was in London, he worked in repetory companies, and became part of the Lord Chamberlain's Men as an actor, playwright and shareholder.

In 1599 he became an part-owner of the Globe Theater in Southwark.

In 1603 James I became king and issued a royal licence to Shakespeare's acting company, who then became the King's Men, the foremost acting company in London at the time.

In 1608 they leased a building called Blackfriars, which they converted to an indoor playhouse. It had some advantgeous features like lighting and possibly heating. The Globe continued as their primary theater.

From 1599 to 1608 he wrote several comedies and nearly all the famous tragedies. The year after (1609), his sonnets were published.

William Shakespeare wrote his will in 1611, bequeathing his properties to his daughter Susanna (married in 1607 to Dr. John Hall). To his younger daughter Judith, he left £300, and to his wife Anne left &quot;my second best bed.&quot; According to tradition, William Shakespeare died on his 52nd birthday, April 23, 1616.

On his grave are the haunting words:

''Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare''

''To dig the dust enclosed here''

''Blessed be the man that spares these stones,''

''And cursed be he that moves my bones.''

It took over 100 years for some of his bones to be stolen.

After his death, in 1623, his friends published the First Folio, the first authorized collection of his works and a main source for the texts of his plays,

==Ingredients==
* 1.36 kg (48 oz. = 6 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* 2 cups undiluted [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|evaporated milk]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]

* [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, salt, milk, eggs, baking powder, sugar and vanilla. 
# Mix the yeast and water together. 
# Add the yeast mixture to the other ingredients and stir.  The mixture should look like smooth cake batter. 
# Cover the bowl and leave it for four hours. 
# Place five centimetres of oil in a pot and heat it up. 
# With a tablespoon drop the mixture in and roll. Loukoumades should be sphere-shaped, fried and should look golden or brown from all sides. 
# After they are fried, remove them and pour honey over them. Use the cinnamon for extra flavour. You can also use sesame seeds for flavour.

==Grammar==
===Basic Sentences===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The sentence structure of Chinese is very similar to that of English in that they both follow the pattern of [[w:Subject_Verb_Object|Subject-Verb-Object]] (SVO). Unlike many languages, verbs in Chinese are not conjugated and noun and adjective endings do not change. They are never affected by things such as time or person.

1.  我叫艾美。

===Sentences using &lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt; [是]===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The equational verb {{term-zh|是|shì|to be}} can be used as the English ''is'' or ''equals''. {{term-zh|是|shì}} can only be used to equate combinations of nouns, noun phrases, and pronouns. In Chinese, {{term-zh|是|shì|to be}} is not used with adjectives, as it is in English, as in, &quot;He is cold.&quot;

===Articles===
There are no articles in Chinese grammar.  While English noun clauses often begin with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, or &quot;the&quot;, Chinese is less verbose.

An example:
# 我是中国人。
#:Wǒ shì Zhōngguórén. 
#:''I '''am''' [a] Chinese person.''

An &quot;a&quot; appears in the English translation, but the [[w:Grammatical number|singular]] and [[w:Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite]] nature of {{term-zh|中国人|Zhōngguórén|Chinese person}} is just inferred in Chinese.

The declarative example sentence in #1 is transformed into an interrogative in #2.

1. 她是金妮。

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Using the ending modal particle {{term-zh|呢|ne}} makes a question when the context is already known, similar to saying &quot;How about...?&quot; in English. A common circumstance is when you wish to repeat a question that was just asked for another subject. Simply add {{term-zh|呢|ne}} to the end of the noun or pronoun to ask &quot;How about ''this''&quot;.
|-

1.  我叫东尼, 你呢？

1. 他们是'''哪'''国人？
:Tāmen shì '''nǎ''' guó rén?
:''What nationality are they?'' (literally, &quot;They are '''what''' country person?&quot;)

Thanks for the welcome... I have indeed been torn away from Wikipedia, because I really want to get a merit badge project going... [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 07:07, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)


Thanks for your message.  I am not sure that homomorphisms really must come before isomorphisms.  For example, Jacobson covers isomorphisms first is Basic Algebra I (of course, BAI is not the best organized book out there, but I don't think that that has anything to do with his putting isomorphisms first.)  I like doing isomorphisms and Cayley's theorem early on because it gives a more concrete insight into where groups come from.  

As for answers to exercises, I will certainly write some up, but I think it would be better to include some solutions, but not necessarily the even ones.  Doing the even ones will make it more difficult later if we want to rearrange exercises.

Also, I was wondering what the goal is for this book.  What is the audience?  I am guessing that we are aiming at something at around the level of Herstein's Topics in algebra, perhaps with some additional topics, a more geometric approach (like talking about graphs of groups), treating linear algebra earlier, giving a more general treatment of Galois theory, etc.  I used Herstein as my first book in algebra (actually, my first book in abstract mathematics) and certainly agree with you that a down to earth approach is needed.  I suppose the main question is whether we want to assume that our readers have the knowledge and maturity from, say, a linear algebra class.  Since abstract algebra was my introduction to higher mathematics, I can certainly see that if we are writing for newcomers to mathematics, we need to be very careful in the exposition.

Perhaps setting out a tentative outline on the talk page would be useful.

Thanks for your kind words.  [[User:Dan Gardner|Dan Gardner]] 01:14, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Organising [[Programming:C plus plus]] ==

As an experienced [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookian]] and a contributor to [[Programming:C]], you are invited to give your opinion in [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Attracting_contributors_to_a_textbook:_Differences_from_the_.27pedia|the lounge]] and/or [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] about the discussions between new user [[User:Panic2k4|Panic2k4]] and me regarding how a book should be organised. Unfortunately not many have responded to my comment on the lounge.

Panic's line of thought seems to be tangential to my &quot;wikipedia-trained&quot; ideas about organising a wikibook. I was following the example of Programming:C to organize the book C++, but Panic seems to want everything in a single module, without wiki links in the running text. I am not sure want I could do about it, but I fear [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|his /her efforts]] at reorganising material in the book might get wasted if we ultimately decide to have the material in separate modules.

My POV is that it is beyond doubt that we need many modules. But if that's how it'd end up, I'd like someone to tell Panic gently that he/she would've to be satisfied with multiple modules. Or else I'd like an experienced Wikibookian (Either my common sense or my ego is preventing me from digesting whatever Panic says) to tell me (sternly :)) that I'm wrong. My attempt to get a community verdict on this issue at the lounge seems to have failed miserably.

Also I see many of Panic's edits as POVs, e.g. &quot;never use tabs, use only spaces&quot;. I'm not sure how to talk to him/her about this (though I'd already linked him/her to [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]. Also, I'd hope Panic doesn't get annoyed and leave from Wikibooks as he seems to be a good Wikibookian in the making. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:38, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Thanks for your 2c :)! BTW what Panic calls forks is having multiple modules/books on related (but not the same) topic. So it's not the fork that we dread. He/she was responding to my idea that (e.g.) C++, MFC and OOP are different books and one should not make the C++ book cover everything related to C++. e.g. like we have a book on [[ComputerScience:Distributed Systems|Distributed Systems]] separate from the one on [[Programming:C|C]]. Panic says we should have just a single book until we get more material at which time we can &quot;fork&quot;. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:47, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Hi again, [[User:Panic2k4]] refactored [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]]. I restored (uncommented) the past discussion and gave my reasons there. I'm not sure if such refactoring of talk pages not in the User_talk namespace is allowed. I'd like to know if what Panic did is correct, if what I did is correct and what we should be doing henceforth.
: Archival is OK, removing text to suit some purpose of either editor is not. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]]

:Panic has explicitly mentioned that he/she won't bother about exploring wikibooks and keep contributing the way he/she likes. I suppose he/she doesn't already know how we work and doesn't want to know except by &quot;spoonfeeding&quot; (since he/she won't explore). Hence somehow he/she should be convinced by others to learn to work the way we do. What do we do in Wikibooks to handle &quot;clueless newbies&quot;, if I may call either him/her or myself so? Unfortunately my posts in the Staff lounge don't evoke many responses, at least not by the time Panic has made a lot of edits. I'd like to know where to post such things (without troubling just you).
:: There's nothing so far, I'm afraid. This is a problem of Wikibooks since we get less traffic. Pages can be protected if need be to force discussions, but that's usually for the case of edit wars. 

:BTW is it OK for the image transcluded in [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus]] to stay? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 13:10, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:: I don't see any images. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:26, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

After I tried responding to [[User:Panic2k4]]'s comments and bringing back a proposal that I don't agree is dead, and replacing the &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; headers with &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; ones, he forked off [[Programming: C -/- -/-]] as well as [[Talk:Programming: C -/- -/-]]. I'm totally lost. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 16:13, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I've also asked [[User:Yann]], a sysop mentioned currently in [[Special:Recentchanges]], to help. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 16:15, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Troll watch ==

Troll watch: 67.115.107.84. You can see some of the edits made at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.115.107.84]

Also, likely they have a user account at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Jm51]. Can we block the IP? --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:47, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Thanks for the block! ==

Thanks for blocking that new troll account. I was about to do it myself but I'm unsure of the procedure. Where do I post to let other admins know that action should be taken? In pure vandalism, am I allowed to block without conferals? --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:39, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== example ==

regarding a comment on my talk page asking me to cite an example for &quot;pages with real content sometimes disappear (in clear violation of policy) without even a vote&quot;

It has been claimed that Cookbook:Human contained some real content. The person responsible for
deleting the entry has not disputed this accusation; instead they claimed some sort of right to arbitrarily decide (without a vote) that such an entry did not belong.

Now, maybe it does not belong. This is a matter for a VfD. I suspect that the original page was indeed
quite awful... but it still should be immune to an admin being jury, judge, prosecuter, and executionist. As a general rule, I'd like to see awful pages getting fixed instead of destroyed.

For some odd reason, I need admin rights to even investigate this sort of thing.

== Admin bit ==

So, I've been listed on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] page for over 2 weeks now,
and have 2 of 3 votes in support. (plus my own, of course) Could you set the bit soon?
(I just found myself trying to move a page over an old redirect which unfortunately had some
trivial history blocking me. Bummer.)

== Meat_loaf and Meatloaf ==

There was a redirect from Meat_loaf to Meatloaf.
Somebody blanked it out, commenting that the 1-word
version was more popular. Since they did so, I am
now unable to move Meat_loaf to Meatloaf. I gave a
try moving Meat_loaf away first, but the redirect
left behind was inelligable for move-over-redirect.

So, that's 2 trivial pages that ought to go.

== Promotion? ==

Hello there.  I've been listed on the requests for adminship page for quite a while now, and I was just wondering if you could promote me.  Tally: 1/0/0.  Thank you very much! -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 18:14, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:Sure, I was thinking the same thing, but I've waited on it quite a while, and there haven't been more votes either way.
:Actually, there are a couple admin tasks that I noticed yesterday, the most glaring being the upload form.
:[[MediaWiki:Uploadtext]]

::&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;make sure to read and follow the &lt;a href=&quot;/wiki/Special:Image_use_policy&quot;&gt;image use policy&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; should be
&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;make sure to read and follow the [[Wikibooks:image use policy|image use policy]].&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::The sixth paragraph (&quot;The preferred formats are JPEG...&quot;) needs nowiki tags around the Image: links.  i.e. the code is &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:file.jpg]], when it should be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:file.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I'm not sure if you want to nowiki the media link to, but it should be consistent with the rest.  If you choose not to nowiki the media: link, then please add a colon the the start of the image tag (i.e. [[:Image)

::The last paragraph has broken links: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;a href='http://commons.wikimedia.org/'&gt; should be [[Commons:Main_page]] (I think! Might want to preview this first ;) ).  &lt;a href='http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Userlogin'&gt;creating an account&lt;/A&gt; should be [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:Thanks for your help, and I understand your concern.  I hope this hasn't been too confusing...it's a bit difficult to show what I'm talking about, probably because of the hundreds of nowiki tags :)  By the way, isn't the [[Mediawiki:Sitenotice|site notice]] ready to be taken down now? See you around :) -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 15:32, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::Thanks so much for taking the time to clean that up for me.  I think I missed a spot, and I'd really appreciate it if you could just do this one more quick thing.  &quot;for use in illustrating pages.&quot; has an extra line break.  Can't the banner be taken down now? -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 00:04, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Admin task ==

Hi there.  I'd appreciate it if you could do a few move/deletes for me, I want to add a new lesson near the beginning, so everything has to be moved down (i.e. lesson 2 should be moved to lesson 3, 3-&gt;4, etc.).

The page is at [[Turing]], and I'm adding lesson 2.  I've named it [[Turing:1.5]] for now, but this should be moved to [[Turing:2]].  I'd appreciate it if you could also delete [[Turing:5]] if you don't have the chance to do the whole thing now, it's a useless redirect that was created when I attempted to move everything without admin powers. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 02:33, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

As effectively the top local user here, being that [[User:TUF-KAT]] is away until the end of August, I thought you might be interested in the following: I've started to think about changes to existing policy and project scope so that policies are more clearly defined (as suggested by [[User:Aya]], who claims existing policies to be ambiguous) and more open (as suggested by [[User:Robert Horning]], see the debacle concerning [[Biography of Nikola Tesla]] at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Archive]]).  I've made a post on textbook-l ([http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html]) as a result, please reply to my talk page for feedback.

Hi!

Can your [[:Image:Modulus and argument.png]] (and some others) can be used in Slovene Wikipedia? Under what licence? Regards, --[[User:Andrejj|Andrejj]] 07:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

: Of course. I've just tagged the image, just follow the license. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:47, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== VFD result ==

In reviewing the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/A guide to cheating during tests and examinations]], particularly the contributions and reputations of those who voted to delete and those who voted to keep, that the consensus result is to delete. I do not want to delete it myself because I participated in the discussion.

I think it is time that we resolve both this case, and the much harsher [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/The Manual of Crime]] case. I believe Jimbo's words should lead a reasonable person to delete. Since both are so high profile, I think an admin should do the deletion. While we are still deciding the new policy, I don't think we need to wait to delete. We already know what the result is. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:55, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

: I don't see a clear consensus yet on the cheating guide yet, so it may be wiser to let debate continue further first. The crime manual dehate however has been resolved. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 05:44, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

::&lt;s&gt;And what was the resolution?&lt;/s&gt; --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:22, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
::Ah, never mind, I had to click back further in the deletion logs to find it. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:31, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

''Ale, Mustard and Winter Vegetable Pie'' is a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]].

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], finely [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip]], diced
*1 [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]], cut into fine rings
*5 [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]]s, sliced
*¼ - ½ cup dried TVP ([[Cookbook:Textured Vegetable Protein|textured vegetable protein]])
*½ tablespoon [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] or [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]]
*200 ml (3/4 cup) boiling water
*2 heaped tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 heaped tablespoon wholegrain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] (try a green peppercorn mustard, if available)
*200 ml (3/4 cup) rich, dark ale (try a nice Porter)
*black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

For the mash topping:
*1 [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
*½ parsnip, chopped
*½ small [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]] or [[Cookbook:Rutabaga|rutabaga]], chopped
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Soy|Soy]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

==Procedure==

#Reconstitute the TVP: in a bowl, mix TVP, the 200 ml boiling water and Marmite, and let sit.
#Prepare the mash topping:  drop the potato, turnip or rutabaga, and ½ parsnip in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] of rapidly boiling water (this quickly destroys the enzymes that would otherwise have a detrimental effect on the vitamin content).  Bring back to the boil and simmer until potato is soft (about 20 minutes). When cooked, drain off the water, add the margarine and mash until creamy smooth. Set aside.
#Put olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and add the leek, garlic and carrot and ½ parsnip and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until the carrot is soft.  Then add the mushrooms and cook a minute or two more.
#Add the flour and stir like mad for a solid 30 seconds. Still stirring, add the TVP and its soaking broth to soak up the flour and thicken. Then add the mustard, ale and some black pepper. Stir to mix all very well. Simmer for about 10 minutes to thicken the sauce.
#Pour into a [[Cookbook:Casserole|casserole]] dish, top with the potato/rutabaga/parsnip mash, smooth over, and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 20 to 30 minutes or until top is beginning to brown. Remove from oven, let rest a minute, then serve.

This is excellent hearty autumn and winter fare and very tasty.

=== Question 1 ===
Is there a rule to determine whether a 3-digit number is divisible by 11? If yes, derive that rule.

''' Solution '''

Let ''x'' be a 3-digit number We have 
:&lt;math&gt;x = 100a + 10b + c \!&lt;/math&gt;
now
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a + 10b + c \equiv a - b + c \pmod{11} \!&lt;/math&gt;
We can conclude a 3-digit number is divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of first and last digit minus the second is divisible by 11.

=== Question 2 ===
Show that ''p'', ''p'' + 2 and ''p'' + 4 cannot all be primes. (''p'' a positive integer and is great than 3)

'''Solution '''

We look at the arithmetic mod 3, then ''p'' slotted into one of three categories
:1st category
::&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::we deduce ''p'' is not prime, as it's a multiple of 3
:2nd category
::&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;p + 2\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::so p + 2 is not prime
:3rd category
::&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;p + 4\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::therefore ''p'' + 4 is not prime
Therefore ''p'', ''p'' + 2 and ''p'' + 4 cannot all be primes.

=== Question 3 ===
Find ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x \equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 + 4^7 + 5^7 + 6^7 + 7^7 \ \pmod{7}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''

Notice that
:&lt;math&gt;-a \equiv 7-a \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;.
Then
:&lt;math&gt;1^7 \equiv (7-6)^7 \equiv (-6)^7 \equiv -(6^7) \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;.
Likewise,
:&lt;math&gt;2^7 \equiv -5^7 \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;3^7 \equiv -4^7 \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;.
Then
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 + 4^7 + 5^7 + 6^7 + 7^7  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 - 3^7 - 2^7 -1^7 + 7^7  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 0 \pmod{7}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Question 4 ===
9. Show that there are no integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - 5y^2 = 3  \!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution '''

Look at the equation mod 5, we have
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = 3 \pmod{ 5} \!&lt;/math&gt;
but
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;1^2 \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2^2 \equiv 4 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;3^2 \equiv 4 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;4^2 \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
therefore there does not exist ''a'' x such that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Question 5 ===
Let ''p'' be a prime number. Show that

'''(a)'''
:&lt;math&gt;
(p-1)! \equiv -1\ \pmod{p}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;
n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n 
&lt;/math&gt;
E.g. 3! = 1&amp;times;2&amp;times;3 = 6

'''(b)'''
Hence, show that
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \equiv \frac{p - 1}{2}! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
for ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4)

''' Solution '''

'''a)''' If ''p'' = 2, then it's obvious. So we suppose ''p'' is an odd prime. Since ''p'' is prime, some deep thought will reveal that every distinct element multiplied by some other element will give 1. Since
:&lt;math&gt;(p - 1)! = (p - 1)(p - 2)(p - 3) \cdots 2  \!&lt;/math&gt;
we can pair up the inverses (two numbers that multiply to give one), and (p - 1) has itself as an inverse, therefore it's the only element not &quot;eliminated&quot;
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;(p - 1)! \equiv (p - 1) \equiv - 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
as required.

'''b)''' From part a)
:&lt;math&gt;-1 \equiv (p - 1)! \!&lt;/math&gt;
since ''p'' = 4''k'' + 1 for some positive integer ''k'', (p - 1)! has 4''k'' terms
:&lt;math&gt;-1 = 1\times2 \times 3 \times \cdots 2k \times (-2k) \cdots \times(- 3) \times (- 2) \times (- 1) &lt;/math&gt;
there are an even number of minuses on the right hand side, so
:&lt;math&gt;-1 = (1\times2 \times 3 \times \cdots 2k)^2&lt;/math&gt;
it follows
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} = 1\times 2\times 3\times ... 2k&lt;/math&gt;
and finally we note that p = 4k + 1, we can conclude
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} = \frac{p - 1}{2}!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The romance category of plays contains four plays. They were all written late in Shakespeare's career.

[[/The Tempest/]] is set on an island. There is a powerful opening scene with a ship, where some Italian noblemen are taken to the island. All this is designed by Prospero who is a Milanese duke. The other people who live on the island are Miranda, Ariel and Caliban. Caliban is a monster and Ariel is a spirit. Miranda is Prospero's daughter. In the course of the play she falls in love for the first time, with Fernindad. There are other interesting pairings in the play, and Caliban and Ariel shake up the action as well, especially Ariel, who is tired of being Prospero's loyal servant. In the end he is left free. Meanwhile Caliban is tempted to drink by two less reputable members of the nobility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Those extra steps===
I cannot agree with putting in those extra steps, they are omitted for a purpose. It is to force the reader to think actively about the intermediate steps, so that he/she is more involved in the learning process. This book is never meant to be a passive experience, those steps must be removed. The reader must struggle with how we arrive at a result inorder to learn. [[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo]] 15:09, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:Second thought, those extra steps are not harmful.[[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo]] 15:14, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)

===an error?===
at 2.3.1 Simplification it is written:

&amp;=&amp; xx' + x'y' + yx' + yy'\\

&lt;/math&gt;

but shouldn't it be

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
(x + y)(x' + y') &amp;=&amp; x(x' + y') + y(x' + y')\\

=== I consider this chapter to be done ===
I deleted some material and now i consider this chapter to be done.[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 04:29, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== My Kudos... ==

Thanks! very interesting and informative...

==Reasons for Particular Interest==

In &quot;Laws of Boolean Algebra, Simplification&quot;, you mention, quote: &quot;From those two examples we can see that complex-looking expressions can be reduced very significantly. Of particular interest are expressions of the form of a sum-of-product [...]&quot;

I think it would be of interest (no pun intented *g*) to mention ''where'' (as in what field) SOP terms are of particular interest, e.g. to reduce the often lengthy expressions as obtained by solving ''Karnaugh Maps'' (maybe other fields do distract a beginner less, though). Probably also a few more words on the ''why'' would be of interest, e.g.: in practical calculations, each AND, OR and NOT comes at certain costs (which may differ in hardware and software design); thus the goal must me to reduce the overall cost. (This also would introduce the notion ''cost'' in a pretty elegant way, which could be elaborated some more, e.g.: circuit design with NAND logic vs. implementation cost in software requiring NOT and AND etc.)

Just a few thoughts on an overall really nice article.

== mistake? ==

In section 2.3.1 (Laws of Boolean Algebra/Simplification), after the message saying &quot;If the next step is unclear, try constructing truth tables [...],&quot; the statement '''xy + z + x'y'''' is simplified to 1. I don't understand why; the statement is false if x=0, y=1, and z=0. Could someone please clarify this?

[[Special:Contributions/24.6.101.190|24.6.101.190]] 02:35, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

: Now that you point it out, I see you are right.
: I deleted that last erroneous line in the &quot;proof&quot;.
: Should we leave it like that, ending at '''xy + z + x'y'''' with no further simplification possible?
: Or should we modify the starting point and all the intermediate statements so that it actually does reduce down to 1?

== AND - an Operator a function ? ==

I'm referring to the Table where x an y assume different states i.e - T or F. The heading is given as &quot;AND Function&quot;. &quot;AND&quot; is a logical operator, it's never a function.

== More introduction? ==

The name of this section is &quot;logic&quot;.  There was a very short intro to logic in general, then you jumped into Boolean logic.  To make this page more self-contained, it seems that the basics of logic themselves should be explained at the beginning.  Perhaps there is another page that you could refer the reader to?  In the middle of the page, you explain &quot;proposition&quot;.  This part could be moved up to the first section.  Then, you could explain &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot;.  Then, your tables in Section 2 would make more sense to an uninformed reader.  I'm keeping in mind that the beauty of such pages is that students who have not learned this material before can teach themselves from this.[[User:Lizmaemom|Lizmaemom]] ([[User talk:Lizmaemom|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lizmaemom|contribs]]) 23:49, 3 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Points and lines are two of the most fundamental concepts in Geometry, but they are also the most difficult to define. We can describe intuitively their characteristics, but there is no set definition for them: they, along with the plane, are the undefined terms of geometry. All other geometric definitions and concepts are built on the undefined ideas of the point, line and plane. Nevertheless, we shall try to define them.

==Point==

A point is an exact location in space.
A point is denoted by a dot.
A point has no size.

==Line==
As for a line segment, we specify a line with two endpoints.  Starting with the corresponding line segment, we find other line segments that share at least two points with the original line segment.  In this way we extend the original line segment indefinitely.  The set of all possible line segments findable in this way constitutes a line.  A line extends indefinitely in a single dimension.  Its length, having no limit, is infinite.  Like the line segments that constitute it, it has no width or height.  You may specify a line by specifying any two points within the line.  For any two points, only one line passes through both points.  On the other hand, an unlimited number of lines pass through any single point.

==Ray==
We construct a ray similarly to the way we constructed a line, but we extend the line segment beyond only one of the original two points.  A ray extends indefinitely in one direction, but ends at a single point in the other direction.  That point is called the end-point of the ray.  Note that a line segment has two end-points, a ray one, and a line none.
An angle can be formed when two rays meet at a common point. The rays are the sides of the angle. The point of the end of two rays is called the vertex.

==Plane==
A point exists in zero dimensions.  A line exists in one dimension, and we specify a line with two points.  A plane exists in two dimensions.  We specify a plane with three points.  Any two of the points specify a line.  All possible lines that pass through the third point and '''any''' point in the line make up a plane.  In more obvious language, a plane is a flat surface that extends indefinitely in its two dimensions, length and width.  A plane has no height.

==Space==
Space exists in three dimensions.  Space is made up of all possible planes, lines, and points.  It extends indefinitely in all directions.

==N-dimensional Space==
Mathematics can extend space beyond the three dimensions of length, width, and height.  We then refer to &quot;normal&quot; space as 3-dimensional space.  A 4-dimensional space consists of an infinite number of 3-dimensional spaces. Etc.

Here are some hints on '''how to express the date and time in [[English]]''':

==Date==

*  The day of the month, the month, and the year:
** Use ''on'' + ordinal of the day. ''On the 1st of June''.
** Use ''in + only'' and the month. ''In June''.
** Use ''about the'' + date (for approximate dates). ''About the 25th of December''.
* Day of the week: precedes ''on''. Example: ''open on Sundays''.
* Ask the date: ''what's the date'' and ''what day is it (or today)?''.
* Answer a date asking: ''today's the'' + ordinal.  ''Today's the 16th.''
* Century: ''in the'' + the ordinal of the century. Example: ''in the 20th century''.
* Decade:
** Precedes ''in'' with the number in plural: ''in the 1990s''.
** Follows ''something'' for undetermined year of the decade, in other words: ''in 1980 something''.
* Era:
** A.D. = ''Anno Domini'', [[Latin]] for ''in the year of the Lord'', in other words the Christian Era.
** B.C. = ''Before Christ'', in other words ''before Christian Era''.

==Time==
*Ask the time: ''What time is it?'' and ''What is the time?''
*Answer: ''It is'' and the part of the hour or the minutes, seconds: ''It is five o'clock''.
*Parts of the day:
**[[wiktionary:morning|morning]]: ''in the morning''
**[[wiktionary:afternoon|afternoon]]: ''in the afternoon''
**[[wiktionary:evening|evening]]: ''in the evening''
**[[wiktionary:night|night]]: ''at night''
**Halves:
***[[wiktionary:AM|AM]]
***[[wiktionary:PM|PM]]
*Parts of the hour:
** [[wiktionary:O'clock|O'clock]], for example: ''It is one o'clock'' (1:00).
** [[wiktionary:Past|Past]] and [[wiktionary:to|to]]:
*** ''It is 4 minutes past 5 (5:04)'' (or ''4 minutes after 5'' in USA).
*** ''It is 20 to 5 (4:40)'' (or ''20 before 5'' in USA).
** [[wiktionary:Quarter|Quarter]]:
*** A quarter past, for example: ''It is a quarter past 9 (9:15)'' (or ''a quarter after 9'' in USA).
*** A quarter to, for example: ''It is a quarter to 12 (11:45)'' (or ''a quarter before 12'' in USA).
** [[wiktionary:Half|Half]] past, for example: ''It is half past 9 (9:30)''.
*Answer to ''when?'':
**Certain time: ''At'', for example: ''At 5 p.m.''.
**Proximity:
***Nearly, about : ''It is about 10 o'clock''.
***Just after: ''It is just after 10'' (a few minutes past 10).
* Synonyms for times:
** ''Noon'', ''Midday'': 12:00 in the 24 hour clock. ''It is 5 past noon'' (12:05).
** ''Midnight'': 0:00 in the 24 hour clock. ''Half past midnight'' (00:30).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sound that ''ng'' and ''ngh'' make in Vietnamese is by far the hardest sound for Westerners to make. ''Ng'' and ''ngh'' simply make the last sound in &quot;[[Wiktionary:king|king]]&quot; or &quot;[[Wiktionary:running|running]]&quot; (as long as you don't make the hard /g/ sound at the end). The problem arises when ''ng'' or ''ngh'' come at the beginning of a word, as the common family name ''Nguyễn'' clearly demonstrates. Here, the speaker has to isolate the /ŋ/ sound, which even many Western dictionaries don't recognize in their pronunciation guides. (Those that do tend to represent it as /ng/.) This lesson will help you to at least pronounce the /ŋ/ sound well enough for a [[Vietnamese/Native speaker|native listener]].

In Vietnamese, the common family name ''Nguyễn'' is occasionally abbreviated ''Ng̃'' – that is, an &quot;N&quot; and a &quot;g&quot; with a tilde (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) over it.
|}

⇓⇑=== Oral exercise 1: Sing-along ===

For this exercise, follow the directions below. It may be a good idea to repeat each step until you've mastered it:

# Say the English word &quot;sing-along&quot; the way you normally would.
# Take the /s/ sound away from the beginning.
# Replace &quot;along&quot; with the &quot;eah&quot; in &quot;yeah.&quot;
# If you can, take the /i/ (long e) sound away from the beginning as well, without making the hard /g/ sound.
#: If you can't do that, try to turn the /i/ sound into a quick schwa (/ə/) sound.

Hopefully, you've just pronounced the word ''[[Wiktionary:nghe|nghe]]''! It should sound something like [[:Image:vi-nghe.ogg|this]].

=== Tips ===

# Touch the back of your tongue to the roof of your mouth.
# Be careful not to make the hard /g/ sound afterwards.

__NOTOC__

'''Vegan cuisine''' uses no animal products, such as meat, dairy, or eggs.  This is more restrictive than [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], which allows non-meat animal products.  All vegan recipes are therefore vegetarian, though not all vegetarian meals are vegan. See [[w:Veganism|Wikipedia's Veganism article]] for reasons why people are vegan, the history of veganism, and other vegan-related information.

Vegans should be attentive to their intake of vitamins B (especially B12) and D, calcium, iodine, and fatty acids. The [http://www.vegansociety.com/html/food/nutrition/ Vegan Society's nutrition pages] have more detailed information on this subject. See also [[w:Vegan nutrition|Vegan nutrition]] on Wikipedia.

When preparing non-vegan recipes in accordance with a vegan diet, meat, eggs, honey, and dairy are replaced with a substitute ingredient. Substitute ingredients try to replicate the taste and texture of an ingredient or its other useful properties. Substituting for an ingredient works to greater or lesser degrees, depending upon the recipe, and some ingredients are almost impossible to replace. For more information see [[Cookbook:Vegan Substitutions|Vegan Substitutions]].

Many vegans choose to avoid specialty substitute ingredients, as these products are often highly processed and high in sodium and allergen ingredients. Cooking with wholefoods such as unprocessed legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables can be a healthier approach to veganism. Many non-vegans will also enjoy these foods. Vegans often find that cooking 'real' foods rather than substitutes result in higher quality, better tasting meals that appeal to vegans and non-vegans alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve">She was beautiful in a strange, mysterious way. Her hair and her deep bottomless eyes were as black as the velvet ribbon around her neck. He planned to marry her before the next full moon rose in the autumn sky.

On their wedding, he watched her walked towards him up the long aisle. She was dressed in a white gown, a white veil, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Even her face was ivory white. But below it, around the ivory neck, was the black velvet ribbon. He remembered staring at that ribbon as the strains of the wedding march brought his bride nearer to him. He remembered the curious and shocked looks on the faces of the wedding guests. But then his eyes met hers, and he was drowning in their bottomless darkness.

He didn’t think of the velvet ribbon during the rest of his wedding day. It was a joyous time, and if people thought his wife was a bit strange, they kept that to themselves. That night, when they were alone, he saw that the ribbon was still there, still circling her lovely neck.

“Don’t you ever take that ribbon from around your neck?” he asked, hoping his question was a needless one.

You’ll be sorry if I do,” his wife answered, “so I won’t.”

Her answer disturbed him, but he did not question her further. There was plenty of time for her to change her ways

Their life together fell into a pleasant pattern. They were happy, as most newly married couples are. He found her to be a perfect wife… well, nearly perfect. Although she had a great number of dresses and wore a different one every day, she never changed the black velvet ribbon. This ribbon began to be the test of their marriage. When he looked at her, his eyes would invevitably fall to her neck. When he kissed her, he could feel the ribbon tightening around his own throat.

“Won’t you please take that ribbon from around your neck?” he asked her time and time again.

“You’ll be sorry if I do, so I won’t.” This was always her answer. At first it teased him. Then it began to grate on his nerves. Now it was beginning to infuriate him.

“You’ll be sorry if I do.”

“You’ll be sorry if I do.”

One day he tried to pull the ribbon off after she had repeated her answer, like a mechanical doll. It wouldn’t come loose from her neck. He realized then, for the first time, that the ribbon had no beginning and no end. It circled her neck like a band of steel. He had drawn back from her in disgust that day. Things weren’t the same with them after that.

At the breakfast table, the black ribbon seemed to mock him as he drank his suddenly bitter coffee. In the afternoon, outisde, the ribbon made a funeral out of the sunlight. But it was at night when it bothered him the most. He knew he could live with it no longer.

“Either take that ribbon off, or I will,” he said one night to his wife of only four weeks.

“You’ll be sorry if I do, so I won’t.” She smiled at him, and then fell off to sleep.

But he did not sleep. He lay there, staring at the hated ribbon. He had meant what he said. If she would not take off the ribbon, he would.

As she lay sleeping and unsuspecting, he crept out of bed and over to her sewing box. He had seen a small, sharp scissors she kept there. It was thin enough, he knew, to slip between the velvet ribbon and her soft neck. Gripping the scissors in his trembling hands, he walked softly back to the bed. He came up to where she lay and stood over her. Her head was thrown back on the pillow, and her throat with the black velvet ribbon around it rose ever so slightly with her breathing.

He bent down, and with one swift movement, he forced the thin blade of the scissors under the ribbon. Then with a quick, triumphant snip, he severed the ribbon that had come between them.

The black velvet ribbon fell away from his wife’s neck….her head rolled off the bed and landed on the floor with a thump. She was muttering, “You’ll be sorry, you’ll be sorry…….”</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Email spam (or just &quot;Spam&quot;) is unsolicited email, similar to conventional &quot;junk mail&quot;, but often on a larger scale.

Spam is estimated to have cost U.S. organizations over $10 billion (in lost productivity) in 2003.

Various software products are available to block or filter spam.  Even lawmakers are stepping up to fight spam- in the United States the Can-Spam Act of 2003 was passed into law.

&quot;Spammers&quot; - people or organizations responsible for sending out email spam - use large lists of email addresses that are collected in a number of ways. One of these means is by using computer programs that search websites for email addresses. An email address that appears on a website is therefore more likely to get spammed, other things being equal. There are various ways of preventing your email being harvested in this way. One is to include it as an image rather than a link. This is not ideal, though, because it means firstly that people will have to type the address themselves, and secondly, it makes the address inaccessible to blind people, or people who browse without images. An alternative, better method, is to use a small piece of 'JavaScript' to insert the email address into the page when it is displayed, keeping it out of the html which an email-collecting spam program might look at.  One final method is to create a contact form to display on your website.  The website user would fill out the form which when submitted forwards the message to you without displaying your email address.  This final method has one drawback in that it circumvents the user's email system and does not provide the user with a record of the email that they sent.

I have also seen many people try the format of me@REMOVETHISaol.com or whatever. The person who has a genuine interest in emailing you will remove the REMOVETHIS part of the eddress before sending, but programmes that gather email addresses en-masse will use it as-is - thus, you do not receive spam. One must be fairly inventive to make this effective; the instance given would be algorithmically handled by most site-scraping email bots.

In addition, there is a new anti-spam feature now availible. Named the &quot;Challenge/Response System&quot;, this either sends a link, or a word-verification page to a user, the first time they e-mail you. The user must either click the link or enter the word to verify they are not a spamming program. After this, you get the e-mail and they're added to your allow list.

A study, by Brockmann &amp; Company IT consultants showed that challenge-response proved to be superior to appliances, hosted spam filters and commercial filters.Brockmann surveyed more than 500 businesses, with 40% of the respondents having IT responsibilities. The independently funded study resulted in the creation of a spam index to measure how satisfied workers were with their spam technologies.

Despite being less sophisticated than filtering technology sold by antispam and antivirus vendors, the challenge-response method was twice as effective as hosted services for spam prevention. According to the survey, 67% of challenge-response users specified that they are very satisfied with their email experience as compared to next highest technology, hosted services, in which 42% reported that they were very satisfied. Commercial software filters, such as those produced by McAfee, Symantec and Trend Micro, scored the lowest satisfying only 22% of respondents.(SearchSecurity.com, Robert Westervelt Jul. 2007)

Spam is a very common thing and at one point or another it is something that we have all had. Spam is not only an annoying email, it is a tactics for marketing. However many times you have received this type of email, it is becoming more and more dangerous. It can be generated by businesses as well as individuals. It is used to promote products and is also brought about by things like forwarding ( things like jokes, images or chain letters) spam can be used to gather information from your computer if opened as well as used to send out viruses. It is becoming an increasing threat. Spam has become such an issue, that people now have to have an entire email address just as a &quot;throw away account&quot; an email address specifically catered toward junk mail because if we were to let it, it would take up about 90% of our inbox's, not only is this an issue for our email account but it is also being directed towards our phone, and needs to be handled with caution

== Introduction ==
As soon as a child first learns about numbers, they become interested in big ones, a million, a billion, a trillion. They even make up their own, a zillion etc. One of the first mathematical questions a child asks is &quot;what is the largest number?&quot; This will often lead to a short explanation that there are infinitely many numbers. 

But there are many different ''types'' of infinity - in fact, there are infinite types of infinity! This chapter will try to explain what some of these types mean and the differences between them.

==Finite and Infinite Sets==

There was once a mathematician called Georg Cantor who created a new branch of mathematics called '''set theory''' in the late 19th century. Set theory involves collections of numbers or objects. Here's a set:

:&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4,5\}&lt;/math&gt;

This set consists of five elements, namely the first five natural numbers. Now consider the set:

:&lt;math&gt;\{6,7,8,9,10\}&lt;/math&gt;

Are these sets of the same size? Yes, they are. This is because they both have five elements. As we will see later, this method of comparing sizes does not work for all sets. An alternate method for comparing set sizes is to match elements of sets in a one-one fashion.

Think of a small child who wants to compare the number of marbles she has with her brother's collection. Let's say she doesn't know how to count beyond ten. She can still compare the sizes of their collections of marbles by lining up their marbles in two parallel lines. The line on the left contains her marbles while the one on the right contains her brother's. If each marble on the left is aligned with exactly one marble on the right, then they both have the same number of marbles.

We can use the same idea to compare infinite sets. If we can find a way to pair up one member of set A with one member of set B, and if there are no members of A without a partner in B and vice versa then we can say that set A and set B have the same number of members. Formally, two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are of the same size if there is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and moreover, for every &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a) = b&lt;/math&gt;. 

====Example====
Consider our previous example. We want to know if the sets &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4,5\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{6,7,8,9,10\}&lt;/math&gt; have the same size. We can create the following matching.

|}


====Example====
Let Set N be all counting numbers. N is called the set of natural numbers. 1,2,3,4,5,6,... and so on. Let Set B be the negative numbers -1,-2,-3, ... and so on. Can the members of N and B be paired up? The formal way of saying this is &quot;Can A and B be put into a one to one correspondence&quot;? 

Obviously the answer is yes. 1 in set N corresponds with -1 in B. Likewise:
:'''N''' &amp;nbsp; '''B'''
:1 &amp;nbsp; -1
:2 &amp;nbsp; -2
:3 &amp;nbsp; -3
and so on. Here, the one-one function that maps from A to B is &lt;math&gt;f(x) = -x&lt;/math&gt;.

So useful is the set of counting numbers that any set that can be put into a one to one correspondence with it is said to be ''countably infinite''.

====Example====
The set of integers is the set containing all elements from the set N, the set B and the element 0. That is 

{... -3,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

The set of integers is usually denoted by Z.  Note that N the set of natural numbers is a subset of Z. All members of N are in Z, but not all members of Z are in N.

'''Is the set of integers countably infinite?''' In other words, can the set of integers be put in one-one correspondence with the set of all natural numbers?

Since the set N is contained in the set Z, we may be tempted to declare that these two sets are not of the same size. However, we can 

:'''Z''' &amp;nbsp; '''N'''
: &amp;nbsp;0 &amp;nbsp; 1
: -1 &amp;nbsp; 2
: &amp;nbsp;1 &amp;nbsp; 3
: -2 &amp;nbsp; 4
and so on. We can write this one-one correspondence as a function

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{x - 1}{2} &amp; x \text{ is odd} \\
\frac{-x}{2} &amp; x \text{ is even}
\end{array} 
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

We can verify that this function generates all the integers in Z from the natural numbers in N.

Strange indeed! A subset of Z (namely the natural numbers) has the same size as Z itself! Infinite sets are not like ordinary finite sets. In fact this is sometimes used as a definition of an infinite set. '''An infinite set is any set which can be put into a one to one correspondence with at least one of its subsets'''. Rather than saying &quot;The number of members&quot; of a set, people sometimes use the word '''cardinality''' or '''cardinal value'''. Z and N are said to have the same cardinality.

====Exercises====
#Is the number of even numbers the same as the natural numbers?
#What about the number of square numbers?
#Is the cardinality of positive even numbers less than 100 equal to the cardinality of natural numbers less than 100? Which set is bigger? How do you know? In what ways do finite sets differ from infinite ones?

===Is the set of rational numbers bigger than N?===
In this section we will look to see if  we can find a set that is '''bigger''' than the countable infinity we have looked at so far. To illustrate the idea we can imagine a story.

There was once a criminal who went to prison. The prison was not a nice place so the poor criminal went to the prison master and pleaded to be let out. She replied:

''&quot;Oh all right - I'm thinking of a number, every day you can have a go at guessing it. If you get it correct, you can leave.&quot;''

Now the question is - can the criminal get himself out of jail? (Think about if for a while before you read on)

Obviously it depends on the number. If the prison master chooses a natural number, then the criminal guesses 1, the first day, 2,the second day and so on until he reaches the correct number. Likewise for the integers 0 on the first day, -1 on the second day. 1 on the third day and so on. If the number is very large then it may take a long time to get out of prison but get out he will. 

What the prison master needs to do is choose a set that is not countable in this way. Think of a number line. The integers are widely spaced out. There are plenty of numbers in between the integers 0 and 1 for example. So we need to look at ''denser'' sets. The first set that springs to most peoples mind are the fractions. There are an infinite number of fractions between 0 and 1 so surely there are more fractions than integers? Is it possible to count fractions? Let's think about that possibility for a while. If we try to use the approach of counting all the fractions between 0 &amp; 1 then go on to 1 - 2 and so on we will come unstuck because we will never finish counting the ones up to 1 ( there are an infinite number of them). But does this mean that they are uncountable ? Think of the situation with  the integers. Ordering them ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... renders them impossible to count, but ''reordering'' them 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, ... allows them to be counted.

There is in fact a way of ordering fractions to allow them to be counted. Before we go on to it let's revert to the normal mathematical language. Mathematicians use the term ''rational number'' to define what we have been calling fractions. A rational number is any number that can be written in the form p/q where p and q are integers. So 3/4 is rational, as is -1/2. The set of all rational numbers is usually called Q. Note that Z is a subset of Q because any integer can be divided by 1 to make it into a rational. E.g. the number 3 can be written in the form p/q as 3/1.

Now as all the numbers in Q are defined by two numbers p and q it makes sense to write Q out in the form of a table. 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp;  &amp; \\\frac{2}{1} &amp; \frac {2}{2} &amp; \frac{2}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp; &amp; \\\frac{3}{1} &amp; \frac{3}{2} &amp; \frac{3}{3} &amp; \cdots\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this table isn't an exact representation of Q. It only has the positive members of Q and has a number of multiple entries.( e.g. 1/1 and 2/2 are the same number) We shall call this set Q'. It is simple enough to see that if Q' is countable then so is Q.

So how do we go about counting Q'? If we try counting the first row then the second and so on we will fail because the rows are infinite in length. Likewise if we try to count columns. But look at the diagonals. In one direction they are infinite ( e.g. 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, ...) but in the other direction they are finite. So this set is countable. We count them along the finite diagonals, 1/1,  1/2, 2/1,   1/3, 2/2, 3/1....

====Exercises====
# Adapt the method of counting the set Q' to show that the set Q is also countable. How will you include 0 and the negative rationals? How will you solve the problem of multiple entries representing the same number ?
# Show that &lt;math&gt; \infty \times \infty = \infty &lt;/math&gt; (provided that the infinites are both countable)

===Can we find any sets that are bigger than N?===

So far we have looked at N, Z, and Q and found them all to be the same size, even though N is a subset of Z which is a subset of Q. You might be beginning to think &quot;Is that it? Are all infinities the same size?&quot; In this section we will look at a set that is ''bigger'' than N. A set that ''cannot'' be put into a one to one correspondence with N, no matter how it is arranged.

The set in question is R: the real numbers. A real number is any number on the number line. Remember that the set Q contains all the numbers that can be written in the form p/q with p and q integers, q different from 0. Most real numbers can never be put in this form and they are named &quot;irrational numbers&quot;. Examples of irrational numbers include &lt;math&gt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; e,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;.

The set R is huge! Much bigger than Q. To get a feel for the different sizes of these two infinite sets consider the decimal expansions of a real number and a rational number. Rational numbers always either terminate:
*1/8 = 0.125 

or repeat:
*1/9 = 0.1111111......

Imagine measuring an object such as a book. If you use a ruler you might get 10cm. If you take a bit more care to and read the mm you might get 10.2cm. You'd then have to go on to more accurate measuring devices such as vernier micrometers and find that you get 10.235cm. Going onto a travelling microscope you may find its 10.235823cm and so on. In general the decimal expansion of any ''real'' measurement will be a list of digits that look completely random.

Now imagine you measure a book and found it to be 10.101010101010cm. You'd be pretty surprised wouldn't you? But this is exactly the sort of result you would need to get if the book's length were rational. Rational numbers are dense (you find them all over the number line), infinite, yet much much rarer than real numbers.

===How we can prove that R is bigger than Q===
It's good to get a feel for the size of infinities as in the previous section. But to be really sure we have to come up with some form of proof. In order to prove that R is bigger than Q we use a classic method. We assume that R is the same size as Q and come up with a contradiction. For the sake of clarity we will restrict our proof to the real numbers between 0 and 1.We will call this set R'. Clearly if we can prove that R' is bigger than Q then R must be bigger than Q also.

If R' was the same size as Q it would mean that it is countable. This means that we would be able to write out some form of list of all the members of R' (This is what countable means, so far we have managed to write out all our infinite sets in the form of an infinitely long list). Let's consider this list.

:R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:.
:.
:.
Where R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first number in our list, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the second, and so on. Note that we haven't said what order the list is to be written. For this proof we don't need to say what the order of the list needs to be, only that the members of R are listable (hence countable). 

Now lets write out the decimal expansion of each of the numbers in the list.

:0.r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;...
:0.r&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;...
:0.r&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;...
:0.r&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;43&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;...
:.
:.
:.

Here r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; means the first digit after the decimal point of the first number in the list. So if our first number happened to be 0.36921... r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; would be 3, r&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; would be 6 and so on. Remember that this list is meant to be complete. By that we mean that it contains ''every'' member of R'. What we are going to do in order to prove that R is not countable is to construct a number in R' that is not already on the list. Since the list is supposed to contain ''every'' member of R', this will cause a contradiction and therefore show that R' is unlistable.

In order to construct this unlisted number we choose a decimal representation:

:0.a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;...

Where a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first digit after the point etc.

We let a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; take any value from 0 - 9 inclusive ''except'' the digit r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. So if r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 then a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Then we let  a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any digit except r&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; (the second digit of the second number on the list). Then a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be any digit except r&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; and so on.

Now if this number, that we have just constructed ''were'' on the list somewhere then it would have to be equal to R&lt;sub&gt;something&lt;/sub&gt;. Let's see what R&lt;sub&gt;something&lt;/sub&gt; it might be equal to. It can't be equal to R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because it has a different first digit (r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Nor can it be equal to R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because it has a different second digit, and so on. In fact it can't be equal to ''any'' number on the list because it differs by at least one digit from ''all'' of them. 

We have done what we set out to do. We have constructed a number that is in R' but is not on the list of all members of R'. This contradiction means that R' is bigger than any list. It is not listable. It is not countable. It is a bigger infinity than Q.

===Are there even bigger infinities?===

There are but they are difficult to describe. The set of all the possible combinations of any number of real numbers is a bigger infinity than R. However trying to imagine such a set is mind boggling. Let's look instead at a set that looks like it should be bigger than R but turns out not to be. 

Remember R', which we defined earlier on as the set of all numbers on the number line between 0 and 1. Let us now consider the set of all numbers in the plane from [0,0] to [1,1]. At first sight it would seem obvious that there must be more points on the whole plane than there are in a line. But in transfinite mathematics the &quot;obvious&quot; is not always true and proof is the only way to go. Cantor spent three years trying to prove it true but failed. His reason for failure was the best possible. It's false.

[[Image:Points_on_a_line_and_a_plane.svg|250px]]

Each point in this plane is specified by two numbers, the x coordinate and the y coordinate; x and y both belong to R. Lets consider one point in the line. 0.a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.... Can you think of a way of using this one number to specify a point in the plane ? Likewise can you think of a way of combining the two numbers x= 0.x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.... and y= 0.y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.... to specify a point on the line? (think about it before you read on) 

One way is to do it is to take 
:a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:.
:.
:.

This defines a one to one correspondence between the points in the plane and the points in the line. (Actually, for the sharp amongst you, not quite one to one. Can you spot the problem and how to cure it?)

====Exercises====
#Prove that the number of points in a cube is the same as the number of points on one of its sides.

===Continuum hypothesis===

We shall end the section on infinite sets by looking at the Continuum hypothesis. This hypothesis states that there are no infinities between the natural numbers and the real numbers. Cantor came up with a number system for transfinite numbers. He called the smallest infinity &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; with the next biggest one &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; and so on. It is easy to prove that the cardinality of N is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (Write any smaller infinity out as a list. Either the list terminates, in which case it's finite, or it goes on forever, in which case it's the same size as N) but is the cardinality of the reals = &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;?

To put it another way, the hypotheses states that:
:There are no infinite sets larger than the set of natural numbers but smaller than the set of real numbers.

The hypothesis is interesting because it has been proved that &quot;It is not possible to prove the hypothesis true or false, using the normal axioms of set theory&quot;

==Limits ''Infinity got rid of''==
The theory of infinite sets seems weird to us in the 21st century, but in Cantor's day it was downright unpalatable for most mathematicians. In those days the idea of infinity was too troublesome, they tried to avoid it wherever possible.

Unfortunately the mathematical topic called '''analysis''' was found to be highly useful in mathematics, physics, engineering. It was far too useful a field to simply drop yet analysis relies on infinity or at least infinite processes. To get around this problem the idea of a ''limit'' was invented.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1},  \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \cdots , \frac{1}{n} \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
This series is called the harmonic series.

Note that the terms of the series get smaller and smaller as you go further and further along the series. What happens if we let n become infinite? The term would become &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

But this doesn't make sense. (Mathematicians consider it sloppy to divide by infinity. Infinity is not a real number, you can't divide by it). A better way to think about it (The way you probably already do think about it, if you've ever considered the matter) is to take this approach:
Infinity is very big, bigger than any number you care to think about. So let's let ''n'' become bigger and bigger and see if 1/''n'' approaches some fixed number. In this case as ''n'' gets bigger and bigger 1/''n'' gets smaller and smaller. So it is reasonable to say that the ''limit'' is 0.

In mathematics we write this as
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {1}{n} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and it reads:
:the limit of 1/''n'' as ''n'' approaches infinity is zero

Note that we are not dividing 1 by infinity and getting the answer 0. We are letting the number ''n'' get bigger and bigger and so the reciprocal gets closer and closer to zero. Those 18th Century mathematicians loved this idea because it got rid of the pesky idea of ''dividing by infinity''. At all times ''n'' remains finite. Of course, no matter how huge ''n'' is, 1/''n'' will not be ''exactly'' equal to zero, there is always a small difference. This difference (or error) is usually denoted by &amp;epsilon; (epsilon).

===info -- infinitely small===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
When we talk about infinity, we think of it as something big. But there is also the infinitely small, denoted by &amp;epsilon; (epsilon). This animal is closer to zero than any other number. Mathematicians also use the character &amp;epsilon; to represent anything small. For example, the famous Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos used to refer to small children as epsilons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Examples===
Lets look at the function
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
What is the limit as x approaches infinity ?

This is where the idea of limits really come into its own. Just replacing ''x'' with infinity gives us very little:
:&lt;math&gt; \ \frac{\infty^2 + \infty}{\infty^2} = ? &lt;/math&gt;

But by using limits we can solve it
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} =  1 + \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{ 1}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt; 

For our second example consider this limit as x approaches infinity of &lt;math&gt; x^3 -x^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Again lets look at the ''wrong'' way to do it. Substituting &lt;math&gt; x = \infty&lt;/math&gt; into the expression gives &lt;math&gt; \infty^3 -\infty^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Note that you cannot say that these two infinities just cancel out to give the answer zero.

Now lets look at doing it the ''correct'' way, using limits
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}x^3 -x^2 = \lim_{x \to \infty}x^2(x-1) = \infty &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression is two functions multiplied together. Both of these functions approach infinity as ''x'' approaches infinity, so the product is infinity also. This means that the ''limit'' does not exist, i.e. there is no finite number that the function approaches as ''x'' gets bigger and bigger.

One more just to get you really familiar with how it works. Calculate:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\sin x}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

To make things very clear we shall rewrite it as 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}(\sin x) &lt;/math&gt;

Now to calculate this limit we need to look at the properties of sin(x). Sin(x)is a function that you should already be familiar with (or you soon will be) its value oscillates between 1 and -1 depending on x. This means that the absolute value of sin(x) (the value ignoring the plus or minus sign) is always less than or equal to 1:
:&lt;math&gt; |\sin x| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

So we have 1/x which we already know goes to zero as x goes to infinity multiplied by sin(x) which always remains finite no matter how big x gets. This gives us
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}(\sin x)  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===Exercises===


Evaluate the following limits;

#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{3x^2 -4}{2x^2 +x} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x^2 -1}{2x^3 +3} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{cos x}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}(2x^2 -x^4) &lt;/math&gt;

==Infinite series==
Consider the  infinite sum 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ....
Do you think that this sum will equal infinity once all the terms have been added ? Let's sum the first few terms.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
S_1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
S_2 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} &amp;=&amp; 1.5 \\
S_3 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} &amp;=&amp; 1.75 \\
S_4 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} &amp;=&amp; 1.8750 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Can you guess what &lt;math&gt;S_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is ?

Here is another way of looking at it. Imagine a point on a number line moving along as the sum progresses. In the first term the point jumps to the position 1. This is half way from 0 to 2. In the second stage the point jumps to position 1.5 - half way from 1 to 2. At each stage in the process (shown in a different colour on the diagram) the distance to 2 is halved. The point can get as close to the point 2 as you like. You just need to do the appropriate number of jumps, but the point will never actually reach 2 in a finite number of steps. We say that in the limit as n approaches infinity, S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; approaches 2.

===Zeno's Paradox===
The ancient Greeks had a big problem with summing infinite series. A famous paradox from the philosopher Zeno is as follows:

In the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, we imagine the Greek hero Achilles in a footrace with the plodding reptile. Because he is so fast a runner, Achilles graciously allows the tortoise a head start of a hundred feet. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run a hundred feet, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point.

During this time, the tortoise has &quot;run&quot; a (much shorter) distance, say one foot. It will then take Achilles some further period of time to run that distance, during which the tortoise will advance farther; and then another period of time to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, Zeno says, swift Achilles can never overtake the tortoise.

I'm going to be pedantic and whine about

''&quot;Infinity is unlike a normal number.&quot;''

Well, no, it's not. In fact, it's not really a number at all.
(Sometimes people treat it like a number --
as if &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; were just an unusual, special number, like &amp;pi; is an unusual number.
But that leads to all kinds of confusion).

* &quot;The word &quot;infinity&quot; doesn't represent an actual number that is bigger than all the others; &quot;infinite&quot; just means &quot;without end,&quot; and is a way of describing something that never comes to an end. There are infinitely many numbers, because there is no last number. And that's really all it means.&quot; http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/60400.html

* &quot;Infinity is not a number, it is an idea.&quot; http://perplexus.info/show.php?pid=1341&amp;cid=7939

* &quot;'infinity' is ... a 'process'.&quot; http://www.jatiyah.freeserve.co.uk/infinity.htm

* &quot;Infinity is not a number; it is the name for a concept.&quot; http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.large.numbers.html

If there's no objections, I'm going to change
the article to say something like
''&quot;Infinity is not number.&quot;''
and try to make it consistent with the &quot;infinite process&quot; idea.

== examples of aleph-one, aleph-two, etc. ==

Could anybody please explain or (using the logic-style and/or ;) ) give an example of an aleph-two cardinality series? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 23:20, 1 Jan 2004 (UTC)
::No not really. The set of all possible subsets (Called the power set) of a set is always bigger than that set. E.g. if A = {a,b,c} the P(A) = {{empty set}{a}{b}{c}{a,b}{a,c}{b,c}{a,b,c}}Even for infinite sets  the cardinality of  the power set is always higher than the set itself. I believe it's true that

 &lt;math&gt;P(\aleph^0) = \aleph^1 &lt;/math&gt;
(I have to check on a book for the proof)

:but I don't know if &lt;math&gt;P(\aleph^1) = \aleph^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Even so power sets aren't exactly easy to visualize. I think they are too obscure for this book. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:31, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Well, okay. By the way, isn't it usually written &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt;\aleph^0&lt;/math&gt;? I have to go to lessons now (science in fact!) so bye... [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 13:35, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::Yes - I dashed it off quick without thinking. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:16, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Here's some examples:
* Aleph-zero: the set of positive integers -- countably infinite. (Any particular member of this set is a relatively harmless finite integer, like 2999).
* Aleph-one: set of the real numbers between zero and one -- uncountable. Think of the binary expansion of a real number: 0.x1x2x3x4x5x6..., with a *countably infinite* number of bits (or decimal places, whatever). It takes a (countably) infinite amount of information just to describe a typical real number, a single member of the set. The set of all of them is larger.
* Aleph-two: one example is the number of open curves of length 1. Imagine you're driving from the start to the end of one particular curve. Any particular point on the curve, you could be turning to the left or to the right. Since there's aleph-one particular points on the curve, it takes aleph-one bits of information just to describe one particular curve. The set of all of them is larger.

==Direction==
This chapter is already looking interesting. But I'm not sure what direction this chapter is taking. It seems to be more like a book then a textbook; more passive then interactive.

==Page Needs to be split==
I did a quick print preview and found that this module now runs to 10 pages. I still have more to write on infinite sets and [[w:transfinite|transfinite]] numbers, so I propose that we split this page. What say you? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]
:I say no. Other chapters are already collosal (primes, complex number...) and I think this one should follow. I certainly don't shy away from a long page without first reading a page at least. The reading style is easy and light here for that reason :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 17:10, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Whoops, sorry for that &quot;fix&quot;, I see what happened now. Never mind :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 20:17, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:That's OK It's part of what makes mathematics difficult. You have to be so precise with the language! one stray 1 in a subscript completely alters the meaning :-( Still with three people regualy checking this page those sort of errors should be picked up. Slightly more worrying is real errors that may have slipped in because of simplifying the formal proofs. &quot;Proper proofs&quot; are dead hard to read, but are very carfefully written to ensure nothing dodgy.[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:25, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==I don't understand something in the closed forms section==
Copied from the page :''So the closed form of'' 
:1 + x + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...
''is''
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{1 - x}
&lt;/math&gt;

''We can equate them:''
:&lt;math&gt;
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = \frac{1}{1 - x}
&lt;/math&gt;

''We are definitely not saying the two expressions are equal in the ''numerical'' sense, for example if we substitute ''x'' = 2 into the equation we get on the right hand side -1, but we know the left hand side equals infinity. Instead we use the ''closed-forms'' for their nice algebraic properties.''

It doesn't make sense to equal  two things that are not equal. The series converges for |x| less than 1 so shouldn't we say something along these lines ? (I don't know anything about closed ofrms unfortunately) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:21, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:This is tricky. They are not equal numerically but are equal algebraicly. Maybe things will clear up when the whole thing is written up. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:29, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)#

==Limits in relation to infinity==
My original intention was to introduce the more rigorous definition of limits in relation to infinity in this chapter. The explanation of limits already present is intuitively very clear, but to be mean to the readers I would really want to see it expanded upon. I was thinking of covering (lim x -&gt; L = inf) kind of thing as well. Diagrams would be nice. What do you think? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:40, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

I think it's a  good idea. Being mean is good as long as the section gets prgressively harder as it goes along so that the readers can choose to stop at a point and still get some good info up to that point. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 15:03, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==Eh?==
(Is very jetlagged, so veracity of comment may not be 100% ;) - didn't Godel go about showing that it really didn't matter whether you took the continuum to be aleph_1 or something &quot;in between&quot; or greater than aleph_1 or something, that basically things would work out either way? Should check later... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:25, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:It rings a bell, I'll try to check too. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 19:40, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:OK I've found a good website - [http://www.ii.com/math/ch/ here]. Basically the continium hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard set of axioms of set theory. Godel proved that CH being true was consistant with standard set theory and Cohen prove that CH being false was also consistant. So it is not possible  to prove CH without adding some new axioms.

== Question on &quot;Are there even bigger infinities?&quot; ==

One way is to do it is to take

    a1 = x1
    a2 = y1
    a3 = x2
    a4 = y2
    .
    .
    .

This defines a one to one correspondance between the points in the plane and the points in the line. (Actually, for the sharp amongst you, not quite one to one. Can you spot the problem and how to cure it?)

I've found the problem. This doesn't work for a number that &quot;approach zero&quot; -- A number that is as close to zero as possible but not exactly zero, i.e. 0.000000......(after infinite 0s) 001.
For this number, we don't know if the &quot;1&quot; belongs to x or y, so it can be
(0.000...01,0) or (0,0.000...01)
But I've no ideas on how to cure this. Can anyone help?


: To get to it, the problem is that you are looking at the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and not something like '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. '''R''' is uncountable, '''Z''' is. Do you see the problem? '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not countable then. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:34, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: &quot;(after infinite 0s)&quot; ? If we're still talking about real numbers, that would be identical to the real number zero. I don't see what the problem is. (I don't want to get into transfinite numbers just yet).

== Natural number definition ==

Since set theory is being referenced early in the book, shouldn't we use the set-theory notion of Natural numbers, and call the first natural number 0?  I know that in various parts of math and science, people begin the &quot;natural numbers&quot; at 1, but here it seems innappropriate. [[User:Siroxo|Siroxo]] 10:20, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== a kind freshman's question ==
well im a freshman at highschool and i had to look up this infinity concept for extra credit and your website has proven to be useful a bit confusing for me but i get the bigger concept but the one concept that has croosed my mind is that infinity cna be limited when you say x&gt;1 and x&lt;2. just in there the answers are infinite but yet they are limited. you can chose any number between 1 and 2 and the decimal number between 1 and 2 are infinite so you have an infinite number of solutions but yet you are still being limited how can that be? what type of infinity is that?
:It is true that all the real numbers between 1 and 2 are quite small in magnitude (they are all less than 2). Also all the numbers fit into this line of no more than 1 unit in length. Yet there are infinitely many real numbers in there. It is strange, no doubt. I think you have already noted that &quot;infinitely many&quot; does not mean &quot;very large&quot;. In set theory, we have this concept of &quot;countably infinite&quot; and &quot;uncountably infinite&quot;. The set of natural number are &quot;countable&quot; in the sense that you can list them one by one in a meaningful order, and there are infinitely many natural numbers. So we call the natural numbers &quot;countably infinite&quot;. All the real numbers between 1 and 2 are not &quot;uncountably infinite&quot;. That's because you can not count them in a meaningful way. A mathematical way of saying that is: there is no one to one correspondence between the natural numbers and the real numbers. It's like the natural numbers and the real numbers come from two type of infinity, one countable, the other not. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 23:19, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

Hi, the point here is not so much concerning the uncountability (viz. just take the rational numbers between 1 and 2, they are countably infinite, and yet your kind of doubt remains to hold). The point here is about the two notions of numbers, one being those which count the elements in a set (here that can be an infinity), and the other, being those on the number line. In this case the infinity is the furthest imaginary point on the right end. If you keep these two interpretations as different in your mind, the problem disappears! Really, the size of the set of rational/real numbers between 1 and 2 is infinite, however, the numerical stickers on them which place them on the number line are bounded (or as you say, &quot;limited&quot;); hence, there is no mathematical inconsistency here in deed. So far as the size of the set is concerned, the numerical identification of its elements does not matter much as you can easily see that the number of points on any two line segments are the same (take a triangle ABC, let R and S be the midpoints of AB and AC resp. for any point P on BC, the line AP cuts the line RS at a unique point Q, giving a one-to-one correspondence between the points on BC, and those on RS -- although the lengths are different). Thus you can keep stretching one of these segments to have bigger and bigger limits, and the number of points on them do not change! In fact you can stretch it all the way to infinity (the &quot;infinity&quot; point on the number line). Try the function &lt;math&gt;tan (\pi (x-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;) on the numbers between 1 and 2 for instance. Hope this helps.

Since the bulk of material is concerned with infinity, maybe the title should just be something like &quot;Infinity&quot;. Well, maybe not so vague, but at least strip the &quot;Set Theory&quot; from the title, as there is no real discussion of it.

:Thanks. Your observation is correct, but the module will be rewritten to incorporate set theory. That is the plan. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 16:51, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

==Errata==

In &quot;Limits Infinity got rid of, Examples&quot;, it is correctly said, that 
&quot;Sin(x)is a function that you should already be familiar with (or you soon will be) its value oscillates between 1 and -1 depending on x. This means that the absolute value of sin(x) (the value ignoring the plus or minus sign) is always less than or equal to 1:&quot;,
but then the formula states &quot;|x|&lt;=1&quot;. There's no reason for x to behave so: shouldn't that read &quot;|sin(x)|&lt;=1&quot;?

Welcome to the '''Korean''' Wikibook, a free textbook for learning Korean.

&lt;font color=&quot;#cc0000&quot;&gt;'''''Note:'''''&lt;/font&gt; To use this book, your web browser must first be configured to display Korean ([[w:Hangul|''Hangeul'']]) characters. Check the two boxes below:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee;&quot; | ㄱㄴㄷㄹㅁㅂㅅㅇㅈㅎ
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee;&quot; | 안녕하세요

|}
The boxes show [[w:Hangul|''Hangeul'']] characters and [[w:Hangul#Jamo|''jamo'']]. If symbols appear as blank boxes, garbage, or question marks (?), your computer or web browser needs to be [[w:Korean language and computers|configured for the Korean language]].

==Introduction==

'''Korean''' is the official [[language]] of both the [[w:North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) and the [[w:South Korea|Republic of Korea]] (South Korea). It is also one of the two official languages in the [[w:Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]].  Worldwide, there are about 80 million Korean speakers, most of which (outside Korea) live in China, Japan or the United States, but they also represent sizable minorities in Russia (esp. Far East and Sakhalinsk), New Zealand, Kazakhstan, Canada, Uzbekistan and Australia.

In the Republic of Korea, the language is most often called [[wikt:한국말|한국말]] (''Han-gung-mal''), or more formally, [[wikt:한국어|한국어]] (''Han-gug-eo'') or [[wikt:국어|국어]] (''Gug-eo''; literally &quot;national language&quot;).  In North Korea and Yanbian, the language is most often called [[wikt:조선말|조선말]] (''Chosŏnmal''), or more formally, [[wikt:조선어|조선어]] (''Chosŏnŏ'').

Experts are still not completely sure of the origins of the Korean language, although it is generally believed to come from the [[w:Altaic languages|Altaic language tree]].  It is an [[w:Agglutinative language|agglutinative language]], so it has some certain special characteristics that are unlike English.  A student of Chinese languages will quickly notice that Korean shares much of their vocabulary, while a Japanese student will also notice similarities in grammar and vocabulary.

Feel free to use [[wikt:Category:Korean language|English Wiktionary's '''Korean language''' Category]] as a reference for these courses.  New students to this type of language may initially progress slowly, but as study progresses, previously unfamiliar aspects of Korean will begin to make sense and new concepts will be more easily learned.  Korean grammar is complex but surprisingly also very simple, and always very fun to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Pingvo,

Here are some of my perspectives on Free Response.

I'm not American, but many things of this type are done all over the world.

When you had the question/cue: &quot;A person's identity is shaped at birth&quot;,

a usual and useful point to the breakdown is looking at the key words.

This would be &quot;identity&quot; (the thing belonging to the person. Identity can be things that are similar to other people, as well as the things that make us different, individual or unique)
&quot;shaped&quot; (the concept that is being created or changed, or sometimes destroyed)
and &quot;birth&quot; (literally, the time when we are all brought into earth, sometimes it can have connotations of a 'spiritual' or 'emotional' birth, particularly when we are looking at literary texts).

It's good to do this kind of discursive analysis. It alone can suggest many directions for the burgeoning essay, though often this is not enough. You have to look at the essay question/cue as a whole thing, that it COMMUNICATES as a question, and is ASKING you something vitally important. It then allows you to COMMUNICATE and EXPRESS many things.

A good philosophical way to go about it is &quot;What if [it were true/not true] that a person's identity [or other thing that stands in its stead] is shaped [what else happens if it's shaped 'the wrong way', or not at all] at birth?&quot; That means essentially reversing the propsition, or subverting it, or considering other possibilities. It's a free response after all! You can do that!

Also free responses are written in certain genres (types of written work that has certain conventions of form and content). Where I study there is a unit of English known as a &quot;Writing Folio&quot;. This basically contains all our non-text work. Another important part of our non-text work is where we look critically at things in the media and that's usually called Issues. It's on a current media text.

A free response can be any of these:
* A document suited to the workplace like a letter, memorandum, letter or e-mail, or a report
* A fictional narrative or other extended personal/imaginative piece
* A non-fictional piece intended to convey complex or technical information
* A report of an investigation, presented in journalistic style
* A biographical/autobiographical account
* A poem/short fictional piece (like a short story)
* A reflection on an issue dealt with in one or more texts
(Which sounds very much like what you've been doing)
* and a piece intended to present a point of view persuasively.

Some of these have VERY DEFINITE how-tos, some of them have great flexibility and others are free for all. Generally the free-for-alls are NOT recommended by teachers. We are told, for example, that poetry loses us marks because it's hard to do.

I notice that in your piece you use several openers and closers, and you put it into four pretty standard paragraphs: an introduction, two paragraphs of argument or discourse and a conclusion. You seem to be commenting about what it means for the plot, the character and the theme; as well as what it means for us out there in the wider world. Nearly all texts comment on something, and it's important for students to show an understanding of this, particularly as they get into more advanced grade/year levels.

The structure of writing is very important as it makes it easier to tell someone what you're going to say. Academic writing has a very strong structure, which is indicated by words and phrases and where they are. If you know these words and phrases, and how to use them appropriately and fluently, then you're halfway there to good academic writing. Ideas, of course, are the other half. They indicate the levels of a text.

Also it's very important to have the sense of authorship, and readership. You must know your audience, purpose and form. In an examination, or in an assessment task for class, you write for a mature and educated readership. Most texts are written for that readership, but the people who assess your exams are a small part of that readership in real life. So focus on them only to the extent that promotes good scholarship and academic truth and freedom. This neccestates original ideas, and thatyou can respond to a situation. So many many examiners complain of trite and regurgitated ideas and structure. This can be corrected by many references to the author and his/her intentions (many text questions do ask about these, directly or indirectly), and how the reader feels/responds/thinks. Many times this reader will be a 'general' or 'ideal' reader, and when or if you encounter post-modernist ideas, there is the idea of many readers and meanings and texts. In post-modernism, we create the text ourselves from the raw material and information we are given, so there's no general or ideal reader as such. Or if there is, it's one who actively engages with the text.

Perhaps most important in a &quot;Free Response&quot;, after you have conformed thus to the requirements, is the ability to 'freestyle' or 'improvise'. Of course you must give your reader some idea of where they are heading. I can't very well go into your head and see any freestyling or improvising, but they mark the top students and the top writers. Top writers aren't always top students, as I'm sure you can appreciate! But they can be, they can be!

----
Ah, thanks for the post. I should probably do some more looking around at other websites talking about AP writing. BTW, I'm not very far into the AP program, having only taken it for a couple of months before I read this essay.

I should probably start with the stricter types of essays (DBQ, etc.). Also, it would be great if a better writer sent in an essay to use. It looks like this will be quite a project, as well as very interesting. ;-) - [[User:Pingveno|Pingveno]] 23:34, 15 Feb 2004 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Holiday Recipes|Holiday]]

'''Pumpkin pie''' is a traditional American and Canadian holiday dessert. It consists of a pumpkin-based custard baked in a single pie shell. The pie is traditionally served with whipped cream.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups (480ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], scalded
*2 cups (450g) [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]], cooked and strained (or plain canned pumpkin). Use the smaller 'Sugar Pumpkin' instead of the big 'Jack O Lantern' pumpkin. The smaller 'Sugar Pumpkin' has a firm and smooth texture while the larger 'Jack O Lantern' pumpkin has more stringy or fibrous texture and more watery for a flesh. 
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]
*1/8 cup (30g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*&amp;frac12; tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/4 tsp. [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] (optional)
*2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], beaten
*1 unbaked nine-inch [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|pie shell]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 350 °F (180 °C).
#Blend all ingredients, except the pie shell, together.  
#Pour into the unbaked pie shell.  
#Bake at 350 °F (180 °C) for 45 minutes.  
#Let cool and serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*This recipe replaces much of the [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] normally found in a [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]] [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] recipe with [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]].  Use only real 100 percent maple syrup, not maple-flavored pancake syrup, as their sugar content is different. You can also use brown sugar instead of maple syrup.
*:''Note [[#Substitutions|substitutions]], below.''
*Prepare the raw pumpkin by skinning and cutting into 1&quot; cubes. Bake at 350 °F (180 °C) for an hour and then turn off the heat. Leave the pumpkin in the oven for another hour or two, this will reduce the moisture content. The pumpkin may also be steamed but may end up with too much moisture, resulting in a runny pie. A 10&quot; (25cm)-diameter pumpkin will make 4 to 6 pies. The pumpkin may also be baked whole and skinned afterwards.
*Pumpkin pie has no top crust, which makes most forms of decoration impossible, but for a more aesthetically-pleasing pie, put dollops of real [[Cookbooks:Whipped cream|whipped cream]] on each slice, or add a decorative rim to the side crust with artfully layered dough cut-outs, in the shape of fall leaves, squash or pumpkins.
*Variant: Chocolate-covered pumpkin pie
**After the pie has cooled, melt 2 oz. (55g) of sweetened [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] (milk or dark) and pour over the top of the pie.  Be sure to completely cover the pumpkin.  Refrigerate to set the chocolate.
*Variant: Pumpkin Pasties
**Roll pie crust pastry thin and cut into circles approx 4&quot; in diameter.
Put a spoonful of the cool pumpkin mixture towards one side of the center of the circle.
Fold over the crust into a half-circle and firmly crimp the edges closed.
Slice three small slits in the top for venting.
Place on a greased cookie sheet.
Bake only until crust is a light golden-brown, approx 10 minutes.
===Substitutions===
* 14 oz. (1 can) sweetened condensed milk can replace the scalded milk and maple syrup.
* 2 cups of plain canned pumpkin can replace the cooked and strained pumpkin.
*: Do not use &quot;pumpkin pie filling&quot;, which has added spices.
*: For a discussion on the use of canned pumpkin and the recipes attached, please see [[Cookbook Talk:Pumpkin Pie|the talk page]].

[[../Verbs/]]
----
No bones about it. The present tense is EASY. Just memorize the endings for the different verbs and a couple of oddball exceptions and you will be able to talk about any momentary thing that is on your mind. Who needs to plan for the future, dwell on the past, or delve into abstraction anyway ?

There are three verb types in Spanish. They are called '''-AR, -ER,''' and '''-IR verbs.''' Each of these refers to the last two letters of the [[../Infinitive|infinitive]] form of the verb. Examples: ''' -AR: bailar''', ''to dance''; '''-ER: aprender,''' ''to learn;'' and '''-IR: escribir,''' '' to write.''

When you '''conjugate''' a verb you take the generic, infinitive form and change the ending to match the person(s) or thing(s) doing whatever action the verb describes. In Spanish, the last two letters come off and another ending goes on in their place. Each verb tense has its own set of six endings for each verb type. Don't worry though, there are patterns there and much of the endings overlap so it is easier to remember them.

The present tense verb endings are as follows:

===-ar verbs===

:Yo (I): '''-o''' 
:Tú (you, informal): '''-as''' 
:El, ella, or usted (he, she, or you, formal): ''' -a'''
:Nosotros (we): '''-amos'''
:Vosotros (you, plural): '''-áis'''
:Ellos, ustedes (they, or you, plural formal): '''-an'''

That is:

:'''-o'''
:'''-as''' 
:'''-a'''
:'''-amos'''
:'''-áis'''
:'''-an'''

Sometimes the vowel in the ending is accented.

Here is an example conjugation:

'''Bailar'''

:'''Yo bailo. ''' ''I dance.''
:'''Tú bailas. ''' ''You dance.''
:'''Usted, Él, Ella baila. ''' ''You (respectful) dance, he or she dances''
:'''Nosotros bailamos. ''' ''We dance.''
:'''Vosotros bailáis. ''' ''You dance.''
:'''Ustedes, Ellos, Ellas bailan. ''' ''They dance.''

Of course, most of the above statements can be restated without any loss of meaning with no pronoun: '''Bailo''' -- ''I dance''; '''bailas''', ''you dance''. In Spanish, the verbs change to reflect the person(s) doing the action on them and it is OK to leave off the pronouns, especially when context makes the subject clear.

===-er/-ir verbs===
-ER and -IR verbs are almost identical, so they are often listed together. The only differences in the present tense are in '''Nosotros''' and '''Vosotros'''.

For -ER verbs:
:Yo (I): '''-o''' 
:Tú (you, informal): '''-es''' 
:El, ella, or usted (he, she, or you, formal): ''' -e'''
:Nosotros (we): '''-emos'''
:Vosotros (you, plural): '''-éis'''
:Ellos, ustedes (they, or you, plural formal): '''-en'''

For -IR verbs:
:Yo (I): '''-o''' 
:Tú (you, informal): '''-es''' 
:El, ella, or usted (he, she, or you, formal): ''' -e'''
:Nosotros (we): '''-imos'''
:Vosotros (you, plural): '''-ís'''
:Ellos, ustedes (they, or you, plural formal): '''-en'''

That is:
:'''-o'''
:'''-es'''
:'''-e'''
:'''-emos''' (for -ER) or :'''-imos''' (for -IR)
:'''-éis''' (for -ER) or :'''-ís''' (for -IR)
:'''-en'''

Here is an example conjugation of an -ER verb:

'''Aprender'''

:'''Yo aprendo. ''' ''I learn.''
:'''Tú aprendes. ''' ''You learn.''
:'''Usted aprende. ''' ''You (respectful) learn.''
:'''Nosotros aprendemos. ''' ''We learn.''
:'''Vosotros aprendéis. ''' ''You learn.''
:'''Ellos aprenden. ''' ''They learn.''

Here's an example conjugation of an -IR verb:

'''Escribir'''

:'''Yo escribo. ''' ''I write.''
:'''Tú escribes. ''' ''You write.''
:'''Usted escribe. ''' ''You (respectful) write.''
:'''Nosotros escribimos. ''' ''We write.''
:'''Vosotros escribís. ''' ''You write.''
:'''Ellos escriben. ''' ''They write.''

==Irregular verbs==
===Ser===

:'''Yo soy.''' ''I am.''
:'''Tú eres. ''' ''You are.''
:'''El/Ella/Ud. es. ''' ''He/She/You(formal) is.''
:'''Nosotros/Nosotras somos. ''' ''We are.''
:'''Vosotros sois. ''' ''You are (plural).''
:'''Ellos/Ellas son.  ''They are.''

===Ir===

:'''Yo voy. ''' ''I go.''
:'''Tú vas. ''' ''You go.'' (A statement, not technically a command)
:'''Ella va. ''' ''She goes.''
:'''Nosotros vamos. ''' ''We go.''
:'''Ustedes van. ''' ''Y'all go.''

===Tener===
:tengo
:tienes
:tiene
:tenemos
:tienen

Note that the first &quot;e&quot; turns to &quot;ie&quot; in all of the conjugations except the &quot;nosotros&quot; form. That is a pattern that you will see repeated.

== What do you do if you do not have an oven to cook your pumpkin pies in? ==

Every year in October, I enjoy spending my time cooking pumpkin pies. I've always loved having the soothing smell of a freshly baked pumpkin pie emanate through my place. I also enjoy sharing my pies with the people around me. I have even cooked pies for the cashiers that ring up my ingredients. 
This year, I am living in an apartment that does not have an oven. What ever shall I do now? I dont want to give up my pie baking tradition. Is there some alternative to an oven? Could I cook my pie on the stove? Can I roast it over an open fire? How do military people living in the wild cook their pumpkin pies?
Any options that you can give me would be well appreciated. I am a desperate man. The Worst kind of desperate man. I am man who is need of home cooked pumpkin pie.

===Microwave?===

A microwave will do strange things to home-made pastry, but if you are using a bought crust then about 15 min on a slightly-less-than-high power should set the filling. If you want to get really into microwave pies, a browning dish is a good investment. It distributes the heat better than standard dishes and allows things to cook more like they do in the oven.

== Why not use a can of pumpkin ==

This was snipped from the recipe page.

I'm not sure why the above recipe would be better than picking up a can of pumpkin in the store, and then buying the ingredients they specify in the recipe on the back. I'm not saying the above recipe isn't better, just that I have no way of judging, and nobody even claimed that it is. So, I'm going to all this trouble to point it out because I usually follow the in-store prodedure I outlined here, and two years ago I actually tested 3 of them and discovered big differences. 

Libby's brand won to my taste, followed by One-Pie brand, followed by some Whole Food's organic label. My taste runs toward sweeter, very moist (shiny!), not too &quot;nutmeg-y&quot; pumpkin pie, served good and cold. I'm not a shill for Libby's; in fact, I wanted One-Pie to win since that's what I'd always used before, and I like the look of the label better. Also, I have no idea if there are differences in the pumpkin itself, of just in the recipes, and I didn't test the different combinations. But there were significant differences so it's worth figuring out which one you like.

=== because! ===

The obvious benefit of the recipe is that you can adjust the spices to suit your tastes. No guesswork as to which brand of filling tastes better.

You should also consider that the stuff sold as &quot;pumpkin pie filling&quot; is sometimes actually hubbard squash. It essentially tastes the same and yields a pie of the same texture, but I think it has a better shelf life or something, so it's sold as pumpkin pie filling.

Also keep in mind that you can use a pumpkin for more than just pie. Bread, muffins, cake, soup, and so on. You can make a couple pies, a loaf of bread, and some muffins all from a single decent-sized pumpkin.

It's healthier to eat things that you prepare yourself than stuff from a can. [[User:Messedrocker|Messedrocker]] 03:25, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== because!! ===

# If you grow pumpkins in your own garden you need this recipe.
# If you make a bunch of pies, this recipe is much less expensive than buying canned pumpkin.
--[[User:Duk|Duk]] 03:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

:I've added in an optional substitution of canned pumpkin for puree made from a fresh pumpkin. I agree that using fresh ingredients is optimal, but if that were the only way to make pumpkin pie, well damn, nobody in their right mind would ever make pumpkin pie. Canned will work fine; it has the same texture, flavor, and moisture content as the recipe expects. [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 19:25, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

== Different recipies ==

What's the procedure on different recipes. Say another recipe for canned pumpkin, and another more standard recipe (-maple syrup (very expensive), +condensed milk). Do we just name the article [[Pumpkin Pie (2)]] ? --[[User:Duk|Duk]] 04:01, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

: Often what is done is if there are going to be several of the same kind of dish, like [[Cookbook:Brownie | Brownies]], the plainly named one becomes the index, a new recipe page is made with the original recipe giving it a descriptor, like, minty, deep-dish, cherry, or whatever and the new one is made similarly with a descriptor.  If one is the core, original recipe, or very close to it, that one takes up the base name or the name of Plain X, Original X, Simple X, that kinda deal.   So you can end up with Maple Pumpkin Pie, Spiced Pumpkin Pie, Simple Pumpkin Pie and Orgasmic Pumpkin Pie if there are enough recipes that are sufficiently different. [[User:65.95.228.247|65.95.228.247]] 04:32, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

::We could make this a disambiguation page, and find unique names for the recipes.  This one could become &quot;Pumpkin-Maple Pie&quot;, while one with canned pie filling could be &quot;Easy Pumpkin Pie&quot;, or something similar.  Another option, as seen at [[Cookbook:Guacamole]], is to simply add another recipe (or 5) to the page. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:08, 17 October 2005 (UTC)  PS: Don't you love edit conflicts? :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

==Amount of Filling==
Deep dish nine inch pie shells (from the frozen section of the supermarket) hold four cups of filling. This recipe adds up to about six cups of filling. Is this recipe for a larger pie dish (traditional pyrex or ceramic type)? --[[User:Duk|Duk]] 03:59, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

:I've never had a problem making this fit a 4 cup shell.  Maybe the whole adds up to less volume than its parts. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:08, 17 October 2005 (UTC)


== Why is scalding the milk listed in this recipe ==
Scalding is traditionally called for to destroy the enzymes that would thicken the milk during the cooking process, but pasteurization accomplishes this, and you would be hard pressed to find unpasteurized milk in most countries. Therefore, I find it rather needless and redundant to be listed. 01:05, 15 October 2006 (GMT)</text>

Typically, a '''dessert''' is a food that comes at the end of a meal. Its taste is usually sweet, but sometimes strong, as with many cheeses. The word comes from the Old French ''desservir'', meaning &quot;to clear the table.&quot; Common desserts include cakes, cookies, fruits, pastries, pies, ice cream, and candies.

'''Crème brûlée'''

''See also: [[Cookbook:Crème Brûlée 2|Recipe #2]]''

These instructions should provide a crackly crust over a cold [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], balanced in sweetness, [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] and [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] content.  Few can resist its light, silky texture.  The procedure is due to Dawn Yanagihara.&lt;ref&gt;''Perfecting Crème Brûlée'' (Cook's Illustrated, Nov &amp; Dec 2001) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
Serves 12.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Crem brule closeup.jpg|thumb]]

With the oven rack adjusted to its lower middle position, preheat the oven to 300° F (150°C).  Fold a kitchen towel to cover the bottom of a large roasting pan and arrange 12 five-ounce (150 ml) ramekins on the towel.  The ramekins should not touch each other, or the side of the roasting pan.  If the roasting pan is not large enough, scale down the recipe.

Combine 3 cups of the cream and sugar in a medium saucepan.  With a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the saucepan.  Submerge the pods in the cream.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and steep the mixture for 20 minutes to infuse the flavor.

Meanwhile, separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and storing the whites for another use.  Bring a kettle of water to a boil.  After the cream has steeped remove the pods and stir in the remaining 3 cups of cream to cool the mixture.

Whisk the egg yolks until they are evenly combined.  Add a cup of the cream mixture to the yolks and whisk until combined.  Continue adding cups of cream and whisking until evenly colored.  Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a second bowl.  Ladle the mixture into the 12 ramekins.

Place the roasting pan onto the oven rack and pour in boiling water until it reaches 2/3 the height of the ramekins. Do not splash water into the ramekins.  Bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 170 to 175°F (77 to 79° C) or until the edges of the custard are set, with a spot in the center about the size of a quarter remaining wiggly.  The baking time depends upon the height of the ramekins.  If shallow, start checking at 30 minutes.  Higher ramekins can take up to an hour to bake.

Remove ramekins from roasting pan and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.  Place on a shallow tray, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.  Before serving, uncover the ramekins and soak up any condensation with paper toweling.  Spread 1 teaspoon turbinado (Demarara) sugar on each, tilting and tapping to spread the sugar evenly.  Spread sugar only on the number of ramekins that will be served.  The others can be stored for several days in the refrigerator for later use.

Ignite a propane blowtorch and caramelize the sugar on each ramekin.  Take care to direct the flame away from any ignitable material.  Avoid the miniature butane torch since its flame is not adequate for uniform caramelization in a reasonable amount of time, and the finished dish may taste of butane.  Re-chill the ramekins for not more than 45 minutes.  A longer time leads to softening of the caramelized crust.

Serve and enjoy!

==Notes, tips and variations==
Without a torch the sugar may also be caramelized in these ways:
** After spreading the sugar over the ramekins, place them as close as you can under a very hot broiler. Watch them closely because this method tends to be uneven and burn.  Too long under the broiler can also result in the custard turning into a sort of chunky soup which is not a very appealing texture. Works best with fine granulated sugar.
** Heat the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat without stirring until it starts to melt, then stir with a wooden spoon  until caramelization occurs (this is easier to tell with white sugar than Turbinado) and spoon over the ramekins, tilting and rotating them to cover with an even layer.
** Alternately, combine the sugar with half as much water by volume, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook without stirring 3 to 5 minutes, tilting the pan as required to ensure even caramelization. If the caramel hardens due to cooling, warm over low heat until it is again pourable.
** Regular granulated sugar may also be used for the caramelization process in place of the brown sugar.
**A towel may also be placed into the roasting pan prior to adding the water to help distribute the heat across the bottom of the ramekins evenly as well as insulate the bottoms from the heat coming through the bottom of the pan.
** Make sure that before adding the cream to the egg yolks, the cream has cooled down. If one adds hot cream, the yolks will start to clot, ruining the final product.
**For a healthier version, it is possible to substitute half-and-half or milk for the cream, provided that a few more egg yolks are added for texture.

In Great Britian we do not measure sugar in fluid ounces but we weigh it. Should the 9 fluid ounces read just ounces? I'll change it and see if it is left.

[[File:Bicycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|centre|700px|A diagram listing parts of a bicycle]]

[[w:Bicycles|Bicycles]] throughout the world are made with standardized, interchangeable parts. Unlike many modern products, the technology used in bicycles is simple enough to allow many riders to repair their own vehicles with a minimum of effort. 

For any cyclist, bicycle maintenance is a particularly useful skillset to acquire. Every skill learned in this area---no matter how simple or complex---can aid in keeping your bike in good working order, save you money, and make the difference between pushing your bike home or riding it.

'''This page explains how to repair punctures in bicycle inner tubes, and gives some advice as to the most likely causes.   In addition, there are notes peculiar to the use of tube sealants.'''


&lt;h2  style=&quot;padding-top:0px;&quot;&gt;Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;[[image:SchraderValve.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''The Schrader valve'''; all of these have removable cores.]]
[[image:Valve presta.jpg|300px|thumb|right|'''The Presta valve'''; This valve's core cannot be removed but Schwalbe and Bontrager valves have removable ones.]]
The basic parts of interest are these:  

*'''Tires are the rubber outer parts''' that contact the road's surface.  The rubber part is called ''cladding'', and it covers the internal structure of the tire.   The cladding has a  ''tread'', smooth or patterned, depending on its use.   The edges that fit into the wheel rims have wires within the cladding called ''beading'' or ''beads'', and various fibres run between the beads to give strength within the cladding.   Although tubeless bicycle tires exist, they are still quite rare on pushbikes, so this page deals only with tires having inner-tubes.  
*'''Inner-tubes are the inflatable parts''' between the tire and the metal parts of the wheel.  They are invisible apart from their valves that protrude through the wheel-rims.  There are three  valve types in use; [[w:Schrader valve|Schrader valves]], [[w:Presta valve|Presta valves]], and the lesser used Dunlop valves.   Refer to the adjacent image for examples.  
*'''Rim-linings protect the ''bottom'' of the inner-tube'''.   The ends of the spokes enter the rims, and this lining in the rim-well covers them so that the tube is not damaged.
*'''Anti-puncture linings protect the ''top'' of the inner-tube'''.  Some high-end tires have protection built-in, but most tires have none.   As accessories, they can be easily added between the tire and the inner-tube. They prevent most punctures from thorns, glass, flints, and other sharp objects that contact the running surface of the tire, though they can rub on the tubes and be the cause of punctures in their own right. 
*'''Self-sealing tubes'''.  These are tubes with a clotting fluid inside, (''Slime'').   They automatically seal punctures as and when they develop.   They can be bought with the fluid in them or for tubes with Shrader valves the fluid can be added separately.  


&lt;h2&gt;The Causes of Flats&lt;/h2&gt;A ''flat tire'' or ''puncture'' is most often caused by glass, thorns, flints or nails when they cut through the outer rubber tread of the tire and damage the inner tube.   These deflations are usually quick, at least when the object is removed. Although this is the most obvious way to get a flat tire there are other ways too.   Consider these: 

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''Internal abrasion on metal parts'''.   If the spoke ends are not covered by the rim-tape properly, then this might happen. Other possibilities include a rubbing valve stem, or a bare edge wire in the rubber parts.   Inspect the inside of the tire for these and for ''old'' inclusions that are sometimes missed.   Also, make sure that the valve stem is straight in the rim opening. 
&lt;li&gt;'''Rough edges from tube liners or worn internal surfaces in tires.'''   Tube liners have been reported to ''cause'' punctures, and this author has experienced a slow puncture at the free end of a liner in a two month old tube.   When a tire's cladding is frayed or holed, it can rub on the tube and cause damage.   Tires can sometimes be made good with an internal patch or ''boot''; this is a specially made patch or one improvised by adding a loosely fitted section of old inner tube over the inflated one at the site of the repeated abrasion.  
&lt;li&gt;'''Recurrent movement of the tube'''.   This happens mostly when tires are soft.   The tires flatten or ''bottom-out'' on encountering bumps and form ''double'' faults or ''snake-bites'' in the tire.   Tires inflated to near their maximum have fewest of these. 
&lt;li&gt; '''Incorrect seating of the tube'''.   If the tube is not seated well before inflating the tire, it is exposed to unusual stresses that lead to ''single'' faults called ''pinches''.   When inflating tires, first add a little air to the tube then press both sides of the tire around the whole perimeter to check that no tube rubber will be trapped. 
&lt;li&gt;'''Rough handling of the tube'''.   Some outer tires leak fluid when they are punctured, as do tubes with built-in puncture repair fluids.   These cause the tube to become glued to the inside of the tire.   If the user does not know this and pulls the tube too hard when removing it, a crescent shaped weakness in the rubber results.   These areas usually become punctures, often after only a few days.   Expect binding of ''slimed'' tubes when removing them and prise any sticky sections apart carefully. 
&lt;li&gt;'''Manufacturing faults'''.   These happen sometimes though it is difficult to tell these from other punctures.   If such a fault is obvious then return it for a replacement at the store where it was bought.   Commonly available tubes have a thickness of about 0.9mm though racing tubes are thinner; some ''downhill'' tubes are are made up to 2mm thick.   The thicker tubes are slower to produce pinches and snakebites though they have a greater rotational mass, (heavy pedalling), and in any case are rarely stocked by bike shops.&lt;/ul&gt;   
&lt;li&gt;'''A series of recurrent punctures''', where there seems to one every other day suggests that either the user is at fault in not properly clearing the ''cause'' of punctures, or that a long series of ''pinches'' and ''snakebites'' are just starting to break through.   Replace the tube, check the state of the inside tire, or perhaps install a tube sealant.
&lt;li&gt;'''Valve leakage''':  Some valve cores can develop slow leaks when the fibres of tube sealants settle within them, and not all valve cores can be removed for cleaning.   If a valve is not positioned squarely where it protrudes from the rim of the wheel, then the rubber will be stressed at that point and a puncture is likely to develop.&lt;/ul&gt;

==Replace or Repair?==
It is undoubtedly easier to change a tube for a new one than it is to find the puncture in the original.   For this reason many riders carry both puncture repair materials ''and'' a new tube when they travel for any great distance.

When on the road it is sometimes difficult to find the point on an inner tube that is punctured.   If it is a ''slow'' puncture it might be possible to pump some air into the tube, perhaps more than once, enough to reach home or a more convenient place to do the work.   If is it a ''quick'' deflation, then a repair or replacement becomes necessary.   When an object penetrates a tire it is best not to remove it immediately if it is the only thing that keeps air in the system. Instead, use the remaining air to get the bike home before removing it.

If the tires are fitted with self-sealing fluids it might be that the puncture will have been fixed already and that the tire just needs to be inflated.   A puncturing object should be removed from such a tire only when the part with the inclusion has been rotated to the ''six-o'clock'' position; this  allows the internal sealant to fully reach the puncture.   A different method is needed for slow-to-seal sidewall ''pinches''; allow the fluid to pond at the bottom of the tire then tilt the wheel, slowly rotating it, so that the fluid can reach the internal sidewalls.

If the tire is not self-sealing, and ''must'' be repaired rather than replaced, then the remainder of this page will explain how.

==The Basic Tools== 
This section lists the basic requirements for tube repair.  The primary items are these:

*'''A pump that fits your valves'''. ''Adaptors too for some pumps''.
*'''Puncture patches'''.   ''The kind that need glue or the ones that are pre-glued''.
*'''Rubber vulcanising solution'''. This is the glue that sticks rubber together.  It is not needed for some kinds of patches.   ''You also need a pin to puncture the top of the tube.'' 
*'''A small piece of ''fine'' oil paper or sandpaper'''.
*'''A pen '''that can make marks on rubber, like a black Sharpie(TM), or a wax crayon. ''Users please comment on what is best''. '''I have found that a pen with 'metallic silver' ink works very well for marking inner tubes.'''
*'''Tire levers''' You need at least two of these; plastic or metal. Some repair kits include these.
*'''A talcum block''' This is included in some puncture kits with a scraper.


Also useful are these:
*'''Wrenches''' . If the bike has nutted axles instead of quick-release skewers, you'll need some tools to remove the nuts so you can take the wheel off, e.g. [http://www.diydata.com/tool/spanner/spanner.htm &quot;ring spanner&quot;] or some other type of wrench.  Some bicycles require two wrenches.  Try out your tools before riding to be sure that they are the right ones to carry.
*'''Hex wrenches''' You might need to release the brakes to get the wheel off.
*'''Valve core removal tools'''.   These are needed only for tubes with removable valve cores, but are useful when self-sealing fluids have clogged the valves, or the cores have become loose.  Removable Presta valve cores such as those of Schwalbe and Bontrager have flats on them that can be turned with pliers.
*'''A spare new inner-tube'''; in case all else fails.

==The Repair Procedure==
Examine the flat tire carefully to find any sharp item that may be responsible.  If a nail, thorn, shard of glass, or a flint is found in the outer tire then mark the rubber of the outer tire with a wax crayon or suitable pen so that the location is easily found.   Continue to check the tire in case there are more.

Some punctures of inner-tubes also cause damage to the fabric of the outer tire, so look for any potential problems such as a bulge, that suggests a torn carcass, or for exposed carcass cord.   If such damage is excessive then it may cause repeated punctures to inner tubes.   At this time the method to correct such damage involves the surfacing of the inside of the tire with a so-called ''boot''; a pre-glued patch that keeps the fibres clear of the tube.   A piece of an old inner tube can also be used as a temporary fix, if loosely wrapped around the tube in the location of the damage.  This latter fix suggests that it might be a good idea to carry an old piece of inner tube in your repair kit.    At this time there is no rubber-based filler for cuts in ''outer'' tire cladding, so water ingress is likely.

If there is no clear cause of the puncture and the location remains obscure, or if it is a ''slow'' puncture, then the wheel will need to be removed to get proper access to the inner tube.   Methods are given below that include both wheel removal and repair with the wheel in place.


Bike tire sticks on Rim - solution ....
It won't always happen but you can't get enough purchase on the edge to push the tire over the inner rim ... So what do you do ? 
After several attempts to lever off with the tire lever ....
The tire and tube were 100% empty of air .....
I put one foot on VERY FIRMLY on the tire ( soft sole) and the applied 1 tire lever to push the bead over the rim and it came over the rim relatively easily .

I was then able to access the tube.

Inserting my spare tube, ** and making sure it was tucked snugly inside the tire ( again completely empty of air ),  I again had difficulty coaxing the tire bead over the last couple of inches of the wheel rim.  ( sounds familiar ).

** by the way leaving the tire on the wheel rim I flipped it inside out and had a good look inside to try (and out ) to try and make sue there were no spikes, pins or thorns on either side that might puncture the new tube. 

I had applied all due pressure with both tire levers bring the tire levers closer together but the last few inches was eluding me.

What did I do ? You've guessed it. ...
I removed one tire lever and once again I applied my trusty foot to on edge / rim of the tire , and then brought the remaining tire lever along the edge ( both hands now available ) until I got the tire bead to flip completely over the wheel rim.  

Eureka !  

Not to be recommended but any port in a storm!



===Remove the wheel?===
====Wheel in place==== 
Most punctures need the wheel removed, but if you are sure that you know ''where'' the hole is, you can do the repair with the wheel still on the bike.  This method is popular on bikes that need wrenches to remove the wheels, and for rear wheels, even when they are of the quick-release type.   However, if the ''front'' wheel is of the quick-release type, you will usually find it more comfortable to remove it anyway.   The sequence for an on-the-bike repair is just:   
*Prop up the bike in a stable position against a wall, fence, or use the bike stand. 
*Move the punctured part of the wheel to a convenient angle where it is easiest to work.
*Deflate the tire.
*Remove ''one'' bead of the tire from the rim using tire levers as necessary, then ''gently'' pull out the section of tube with the puncture.
*Correct the problem, then re-inflate the tire.   The methods for doing so are described in the sections below, though readers should ignore the parts that do not apply to their situations.

====Wheel Removed==== 
*Set the bike in an upright position against a wall or fence, and because the bike will become unstable when the wheels are removed, the frame might need to be secured.   Some risk scuffing the paintwork and turn the bike upside down for wheel removal.
*Remove the wheel from the frame.  On some bikes, you need to spread or detach the brakes to do this, though deflation of the tire first will usually make it possible.
*If your bike has [[w:Quick release wheels|Quick release wheels]], remove the wheel by loosening and unscrewing the quick-release bolts (skewers).
*If your wheel is attached to the frame by ordinary nuts, undo them with a ring spanner (wrench).
*If you have to take off the back wheel, it is usually a bit more complicated, because you need to get the wheel past the chain. If your bike has multiple gears [[w:Dérailleur gears|Derailleur gears]], change into the very top (smallest) rear and front gears to slacken the chain as much as possible.   This makes it easier to get the wheel off.

===Remove the Inner Tube=== 
[[image:Changing an inner tube - Removing the tire.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Using a tire lever to free the bead of the tire.]]  
[[image:Changing an inner tube - Removing the tire (3).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Progressive use of two tire levers with one locked onto a spoke.]]  

*If the tire is not fully deflated, open the valve and let the rest of the air out, as any residual air will make it difficult to get the tire off and the tube out.  If you have Schrader valves then remove the plastic cap and press the center-pin in the middle of the valve.   If you have Presta valves, remove the plastic cap, undo the metal locking screw all the way to its end, then press the end of the valve to release the air.   Later, during patching, the Presta valve can be prevented from refilling again, if necessary, by re-tightening the metal locking screw;  no such procedure is needed for the Schrader since it has an internal spring.
*With the tire deflated, insert the smooth end of a tire lever under the bead of the tire at a position far from the valve.   While doing this be certain that the inner tube is not trapped by the tire lever.   The tire lever is used with the bent end facing inward so that it can be hooked onto the spoke to keep it positioned.   With it so positioned, insert another tire lever about four inches or so from the first, in the same way.   Continue moving and inserting the tire levers until one bead of the tire is free of the rim.    In the case of wide tires this task is fairly easy but for slim tires another tire lever may be useful.  
*Remove the inner tube very gently, whether it is just a local section or the whole tube.   Always anticipate that the tube is sticking to the inside of the tire, and that wrenching it will cause a stretch-weakness.   If the tube seems stuck, then use extra care in separating it from the tire, perhaps softening any glued-up tube sealant with some water before easing the two apart. 
Be careful too, with the valve when it is removed from its rim, and remember to first remove the locking screw on the rim if the valve is of the Presta type.

===Find the Puncture=== 
*If you intend repairing the tube without removing the wheel, the location of the puncture will be already known, but otherwise the puncture still needs found.
*Remove any penetrating objects, and carefully inspect the inside of the tire, visually and by hand contact to make sure that there are no remaining causes of punctures.
*A fast leak in the tube can be found by inflating the tube and listening for the escaping air.  Another method is to dampen a hand, then detect the cooling effect of the leak by feeling around the tube.   Sometimes a small hole is visible, especially near a stretch mark on the tube, or in a place that was sticking to the inside of the tire.   Another likely place is at the free end of a  tire liner.   If the leak is still not found then submerge the inflated tube in a basin or a sink to look for air bubbles.   During this process, it helps if the tube is folded and compressed with the hands to aggravate the leak.   Use a ball point pen, felt marker, or the chalk supplied with your puncture repair kit to mark an X on the location of the puncture. Make the X somewhat wider than the patch diameter. This will enable you to centre the patch over the hole.    

===Repair the Tube===
[[Image:Patch_glue_sand.png|thumb|200px|right|The relative sizes of the patch, glue and sanded areas.]]
*In the area of the puncture, lightly roughen the surface of the tube with the sandpaper to expose clean rubber for the bonding process. Rubber-to-rubber patches make continuous bonds that extend though the glue layer.   Although the stresses on tube patches are fairly low, there are nonetheless optimal conditions for success:
**'''Surfaces must be clean, dry, flat, and oil-free'''.   ''This assures a good connection.''
**'''The glue layer must be thin'''.   ''Thin layers are strong and airtight and bonding is fast''.
**'''The bonding must be undisturbed'''.  ''Escaping air or movement will weaken it.''
**'''The best patches are pressed while they set'''.   ''Press the parts together''. 

*Make sure that the tube is completely deflated before applying a patch as escaping air might spoil the effort; Presta valves can be locked if need be, to prevent their re-filling. There are different kinds of patches in use, and each kind is accompanied by instructions of its own.   A few of these are mentioned below.
**Pre-glued rubber patches with foil backings usually require that a ''thin'' film of glue be applied to the tube, slightly larger than the intended patch, and left until ''tacky''. Then the backing is removed and the patch is stuck firmly onto the puncture.   To avoid handling the glued surface, expose one corner of the patch first and apply it to the tube, then withdraw the remainder of the backing while completing the connection.  Some have a handling film that can be left in place.   If too much glue has been used, be sure to press the parts together for an extended period before use; ''hours'' rather than minutes. 
**Recently, thin clear-film patches have been made available. These do not need a priming layer of glue, and are pre-glued. After surface preparation, these are transferred to the tube directly, using the progressive removal of the backing as described above. Like other methods, they depend on a clean, dry, oil-free, flat surface for the greatest success.   They are perhaps the easiest to use, and do not need a separate glue supply.
**Conventional rubber patches need a thin priming layer for the tube and also for the patch, then when tacky, the patch is made.  
*After making the patch scrape some of the talcum block onto any visible glue to prevent sticking.
*The bond of the patch strengthens with time.   Although a ''perfect'' patch can be used almost immediately, if there is no real hurry, leave the patch to set as long as possible before inflation.
*The most difficult patch to make is one located near a ridge in the rubber; the ridge spoils the airtight connection, and ridges are hard to remove or make flat enough, even with sandpaper.   Sealant-filled tubes can repair such punctures without difficulty.

===Refit the Tube=== 
*Before the replacement of the inner tube, make sure that the causes of the puncture have been removed.   In addition, run fingers around the inside of the tire to find any rough spots that could cause damage to the tube; if found, they can be fitted with a ''boot'', a durable seal that goes over the rough bits of the inner tire, or a loose piece of old inner tube around that section of the tube itself.   Check that the rim tape, (liner), covers the spoke ends and clean any leaked  sealant from the inner tire with a damp cloth.
*Some tires have arrows on the sidewalls to indicate which way round the tire tread is to be aligned; make sure that this is right.   When all is well, add a little air to the tube to give it some shape, and fit it into the tire. Take care in feeding the valve stem through the rim cutout.  
*Starting at the section with the valve, work around the wheel, pushing one bead of the tire onto the rim, using your hands only. If you use a tyre lever it is difficult to avoid trapping the tube between the rim and the tyre.      Make sure also that the valve is straight at the end of this stage, and if it is not then gently straighten it by shifting the tube's position on the rim; not by pulling on the valve.
*Repeat the process to set the second bead of the tire onto the rim following the same procedure as for the first.   Re-check the straightness of the valve stem and make any corrections before proceeding beyond this stage.
*Work around the tire, pressing both sides toward the centre of the rim.   If this is easily done then it is clear that the tube is not trapped at any point.
*Inflate the tire and install it on the bike, paying attention to the inflation limits marked on the tire's sidewall.

==Valve Problems==
[[image:Fietband lek zoeken.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Finding a slow leak:''' ''squeeze the tire in water to find the leak.  This image shows a Dunlop valve.'']]
Any inner tube can be checked for leaks by first inflating it, and submerging it in water.   Telltale air bubbles will seen emerging from the site of the leak.   This process can be made more effective by forcing sections of the tire between the hands to increase the leakage.   

A slow leak can sometimes be caused by the valve itself.  Sometimes a leak can be seen in a valve by wetting its various parts with a soapy solution and looking for bubbles.

To try to fix a leaking '''Schrader valve''', deflate the tire, unscrew the valve body with a keyed valve cap or valve tool, and examine the seat or rubber sealing ring for cuts or nicks, dust, lint, or fibers that prevent the valve from closing fully.  Likewise check the valve seat and the bore of the valve stem.  Clean if necessary. The valve body may be replaced.  If no spares exist, an emergency fix can be had by inflating the tire with the valve sealed with silicon rubber, caulk, or cured epoxy resin.  Obviously the tube must be discarded after such a process.   

If the '''Presta valves''' cannot be disassembled, then tubes with leaking valves must be replaced.   Some Presta valves, for example, those made by Schwalbe and those of Bontrager have removable cores, but most do not.   Such valves can be recognised since they have flat sections on them to allow slackening and tightening of the cores with a valve removal tool.

Internal tube sealants can block both valve stems and cores.   However, stems are easily cleared with a thin object after the cores are removed, and sealant can be removed from the cores by washing them in water.

==Self Sealing Tires==
[[image:slimed_wheel_with_labels.jpg|250px|thumb|Sealed Tire Positioning: When the bike is parked or during tire inflation, rotate the valve to the five or seven-o'clock positions.  Remove penetrating objects only when they are at the six-o'clock position.]]
Sealants will seal most small punctures in tires up to about one eighth of an inch in size.   The product (''Slime''), is already in some tubes bought from bike shops, but can be poured into existing tubes, provided that they have removable valve cores.  There are a few points peculiar to the use of tires with internal sealants.
*'''New tires with sealant:'''   When a tube with sealant is first installed, rotate the wheel quickly several times, occasionally operating the brake, to fully spread the product.
*'''Parking position for the wheels:'''   Because valves might become clogged with sealant when the bike is stationary for any length of time, the wheels should be routinely set to a position that allows the solution to drain from the valve.   The position that does this best is either the five o'clock or seven o'clock positions.   See the adjacent diagram.
*'''Inflating sealed tires:'''   When the tires are being inflated there is a significant airflow.   To avoid any unnecessary clotting of the sealant, position the valves as for parking, in the five o'clock or seven o'clock positions.   
*'''Clogged valves:'''   Despite best efforts, and sometimes at the point of purchase, the valve core or the valve stem will be blocked.   For this reason it is ''always best to use tubes with removable cores''; these can be rinsed in water to clean them, or the stems can be unblocked with a thin object.   A valve removal tool is useful. 
*'''Removing puncturing objects:'''   Before removing a penetrating object from a sealed tire, first rotate the site of the puncture to the six-o'clock position to give maximum exposure to the sealant pool.   This will minimise the air loss before the puncture is sealed.
*'''Slow puncture repair:'''   Sidewall punctures, snakebites and pinches are sometimes slow to heal.   This is because the airflow is low and the conventional rotation speed might be excessive.   To make sure that slow punctures are fixed, first allow the sealant to pool at the bottom of the tire, then tilt the wheel and ''slowly'' rotate it so that the sidewall has full access to the sealant.   Repeat for the other sidewall.          
*'''Patching a sealed tube:'''  Sealant leaked into a tire can be removed with a wet cloth. Punctures too big for the sealant to handle can be patched in the usual way, but the patch will fail unless all traces of sealant are first removed from the surface.   During the sealing of punctures, a small amount of sealant can cause sticking of the tube to the inside of the tire.   When such tubes are being removed, try to anticipate this so that the tube is not weakened by the inevitable stretching.   Rather than tugging the tube, consider using water to soften the gluing effect.

==Overview==

A [[w:bicycle|bicycle]] [[w:wheel|wheel]] consists of a central [[w:hub|hub]] and a round rim, joined by a number of [[w:spoke|spokes]]. Spokes radiate from the hub to the rim, where they are anchored in a screw-thread attachment called a [[w:spoke nipple|nipple]]. By tightening and loosening the nipples, it is possible to bring the wheel back into round (vertical true) or remove a side to side wobble (lateral true).

Spokes may be arranged in a variety of patterns, of which three-cross, four-cross and radial are the most common.  The pattern affects the strength, weight and characteristics of the wheel but is not particularly relevant to the process of truing.

==Tools Needed==

To build or to maintain a spoked wheel, a [[w:spoke wrench|spoke wrench]] is necessary. The flat-to-flat dimensions of a typical spoke nipple are too small to fit any commonly-available open-end wrench. Any good bicycle shop will, however, stock a selection of spoke wrenches, with price and quality being proportional.

A spoke 'twiddler', or nipple driver, is a tool that may be useful in the course of assembling a new wheel from its component parts - hub, spokes, and rim. It isn't necessary - especially if you aren't building a wheel - but it can save some time. Similar to a screwdriver, but with an off-set blade that rotates freely in the handle, it is used on the slotted outer face of the nipple - which resembles a slotted screw. A spoke 'twiddler' allows for rapid assembly of the wheel - or installation of a nipple on a single spoke - and is designed to self-limit the extent to which a nipple can be threaded onto a spoke.

A spoke wrench is used to bring tension to the spokes, and is applied to the square part of the nipple that protrudes inward at the rim. Unlike the 'twiddler', the spoke wrench is designed to turn the nipple when the spoke is under tension. This difference is what makes the spoke wrench essential.

A truing stand is a purpose-built stand into which a wheel (rim, spokes, and hub, with axle) is installed during wheel-building, wheel repair, or wheel maintenance. A truing stand is very useful - possibly essential - for making hand-built wheels. Effectively, it is a rugged, precision-made jig for holding the axle of the wheel solidly in place. By extension, the rim thus has a steady reference in the axle in the hub held in the truing stand. The rim is, therefore, also found in relation to a caliper, or set of calipers, built into the truing stand, and against which checks are made for radial and lateral true (read 'perfection') during the course of building or adjusting a wheel. For extreme accuracy in measuring true, an optional dial indicator may be fitted to the truing stand, and a separate tensiometer may be kept to hand to test for proper tension on all the spokes (tension-balancing). Instructions for creating an inexpensive, but very accurate, truing stand are [http://www.chc-3.com/pub/wheel_stand.htm here].

A dishing tool is used to measure the extent to which the axle juts out past the rim. Since a true wheel has the plane of the rim centered laterally between the points on the axle at which the axle is fixed to the frame, the offset of the rim from that anchor point on one side of the wheel should be identical to the corresponding offset on the other side. A dishing tool is used as a comparator: the offset on one side is measured using the tool, that setting is 'stored' in the tool, and the tool is applied to the other side of the wheel for purposes of comparison; the deviation of the second side's offset from that of the first's indicates the direction in which, and the extent to which, the rim needs to be moved to make the wheel true. However, a dishing tool is not strictly necessary if you have a good truing stand: if it's understood that a true wheel (abstracting from the particularities of the hub and the spokes) is symmetrical (i.e. the rim itself is, in some sense, 'centered' on the axle) then you can use the truing stand's caliper (or calipers). and an occasional flipping of the wheel in the stand, to serve the same function as a dishing tool.

==Tools, Punting==

In most cases, especially when truing as maintenance on a wheel that has already been built, checking the tension on the spokes by ensuring that they all make the same tone when &quot;pinged&quot; with a fingernail will work fine. Checking the dish is also unnecessary on minor repairs, as most good truing stands will be able to give an accurate idea of how close the wheel is to centered, though it is probably a good idea to take the wheel out and re-settle it in the stand to double check. It's necessary to measure the distance if you are truing a wheel that is meant to have an offset, but this is very rare.

In a situation where a stand is not available, the brake calipers on a bicycle can be used to measure true while the wheel is still attached, but this is less than ideal. Also, if no other option is available, a small adjustable wrench can be used instead of a spoke wrench or key, but extra care should be taken not to strip the nipples. A glass cutter made by Richards has one opening small enough that it can be enlarged slightly to make a passable 0 spoke wrench - or a 1 or 2, if that's what you need. 

If a rim has been 'pringled', or 'potato-chipped', into a saddle shape, by a lateral blow, it will be difficult to straighten by spoke tensioning alone - in fact, it is probably impossible to overcome severe rim warping this way. Often, however, it is possible to restore the wheel to a nearly-true state, even if it seems hopelessly warped. The procedure that follows should be applied as soon as possible after the trauma; leaving the wheel in it warped state for more than a few days will likely cause the wheel to cold-set - meaning it will retain the new shape in which it is left, and probably will have to be replaced.

In order to effect the following quickie repair, you must have a properly inflated tube and tire still on the rim, and the rim itself should only be generally out of shape, with no damage to the rim wall itself. To wit: standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, with both hands, grip the wheel firmly by the rim and rubber at the point directly opposite the point on the circumference that is most obviously bent away from the principle plane of the wheel; bend slightly at the waist and position the point of the tire opposite on the ground in front of you, with the wheel at an angle of 45 degrees to the ground (possibly greater, depending on the denomination of the tire), and the bent part heading earthward; raise that point off the ground a few inches and let it fall again, ensuring that in the next step, only the tire - and no part of the rim - is going to strike the ground; without straightening at the waist, or bending over further, raise the wheel off the ground to about head or chest height, then forcibly bring the wheel down in such a way as to strike the ground sharply with the inflated tube and tire at the point opposite your grip; the rim should pop back to very nearly true. You can't undo damage done by striking the rim on the ground, so plan carefully, and rehearse mentally before committing to this repair.

If the quickie fix above has improved matters, it's usually possible to improve the situation further with the usual techniques required of truing or maintaining a wheel.

In the event that the above procedure doesn't bring the rim back to at least a rideable state, it may be necessary to replace the rim or the entire wheel. Note, though, that a rim can often be straightened, at least to some extent, by placing the rim (with appropriately loosened spokes) between two rigid objects (e.g. a pair of closely-spaced pipes, or between a door and its cross-wise bar-like handle) and, using a prying action, creeping up on the desired degree of 'flat'. Don't bend the rim more than necessary, work iteratively, check frequently on your progress, and be aware that you may need to overshoot your target slightly to allow for the tendency of metals to spring back from bending.

It should be noted that repairing local rim damage with pliers or even a hammer and anvil is never advised - because less dramatic, more effective, methods are available which will not cause even superficial damage to the rim wall - the all-important braking surface in most cases. Instead of pliers neat, repair a flairing of the rim by sandwiching the rim between two thin, very flat pieces of metal (e.g. two cone wrenches) and placing this in the jaws of channel-lock pliers. An alternative method for repairing rim flairing is to use blocks of wood as both anvil - below the rim - and hammer - above the rim. If it seems necessary to use a hammer, don't strike the rim directly with the hammer's face; lay a strip of aluminum or brass over the area of the rim to be repaired, and strike there. Aluminum cans - ubiquitous and easily cut with scissors or even a pocket knife - are indispensable in bicycle repair.

==Truing the Wheel==

First, remove the wheel from the bike and remove the tire and tube before placing it in the truing stand. Adjust the arm and caliper on the stand so that the caliper is just shy of touching both sides of the wheel. Now, spin the wheel and slowly close the stand's calipers until they scrape against a spot on the wheel.

Once you've found a spot where you are out of lateral true, tighten the spoke or spokes on the side opposite the bump, and loosen the ones that are pulling it out of true. Be patient while doing this - you shouldn't be going more than a quarter turn at a time while truing like this. If the spokes are giving resistance, try over turning slightly, and turning back to where you intended.

After you've gone through several passes like this, you should check the vertical true of the wheel to make sure that you haven't put it out of round. Re-adjust the arm and caliper of the stand so that the calipers are together and just underneath the rim. Spin the wheel, and this time adjust the arm until the wheel begins to scrape. 

While adjusting for vertical true, you should tighten the spoke at the center of the hump, and tighten the spokes to the sides one half as much each. Because these spokes will be on opposite sides of the wheel, this will ensure that you don't put the wheel very much out of lateral true. If the hump is between two spokes, tighten them equally. Adjusting the spokes in one place will affect another section of the wheel, somewhat like squeezing a balloon.

After this is done, you should check for lateral true and even tension, retruing for both lateral and vertical true if the wheel is out.

If the wheel is properly trued and tensioned, you should stress test the wheel by placing it on one side and pressing down on it fairly firmly. You should repeat this going around the wheel, in order to be sure that the spokes settle into position with the spokes that they cross now and not while the wheel is being ridden. This can also put the wheel out of true again, and this should be checked.

A full, comprehensive discussion of bicycle wheel building and truing is found in Jobst Brandt's book ''The Bicycle Wheel'' (ISBN 0960723668).

'''Rim brakes on bicycles are simple to adjust''', and the term ''rim'' is used to distinguish them from ''hub brakes''.   Rim brakes include all brake designs that depend on using brake pads to close on the rims of a bicycle's wheels.   The brake parts for the most common configuration are  identified in Figures 1 and 2. 

Although brakes are usually mandatory on bicycles, the laws and rules for brake performance vary, and some countries, while making law for ''new'' bicycles, ('at the point of sale'), have few specifications for the operation of bicycles ''after'' that point.   Bike riders are advised to use the sources of law that apply in their ''own'' countries, but where the rules there are incomplete or unclear, they are advised to use any ''point of sale'' specifications that are available.   Because the matter might then still be unclear in some countries, a table below repeats the braking distances of British Standard BS6102/1 for '''new'''  bicycles.    

Bike shops can perform any number of tasks for the bicycle owner, but the basic brake adjustments are easy to do for yourself.   At the simplest level they consist of screw adjustments on the handlebars, while knowing what gaps you intend to produce.   At other times, (rarely), the cable length needs to be changed, but this too can be done by anybody with a practical leaning.   It is perhaps when the conventional adjustments fail to solve the problem that most people resort to such pages to learn more.   This page includes a selection of the most common confusions for brake adjustment and explains how to correct them.        

Bear in mind that the best way to learn the adjustment of brakes is to be shown by somebody while it is being done; in this way much of the mystery vanishes.   The next best way is to follow a fairly stolid description of the sort below, and although it lacks interaction, should at least leave the reader better informed than when he started.
&lt;br clear=left&gt;
=== Preliminaries ===
----
[[image:Labeled Brake Lever Mono 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Fig 2. Typical Brake Lever Details&lt;br&gt;A.   Brake Cable Housing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;B.   Brake Barrel Adjuster.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;C.   Adjuster Locking Ring.&lt;br&gt;D.   Brake Lever.]] Consider these few things before carrying out brake adjustments.   Doing so might save time in the long run:

::*'''Is a full adjustment really needed?''' Before doing any elaborate brake adjustments it is a good idea to decide whether or not a simple barrel adjustment might fix it.  If you just need a slight gap adjustment or to balance the brake arms refer to  [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Brakes/Adjusting Rim Brakes#Fine_Adjustments|'''Fine Adjustments''']] below. &lt;!--Section does not exists--&gt;
&lt;!--[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Brakes/Adjusting_brakes#Fine_Adjustments  '''Fine Adjustments''']--&gt;
  
::*'''Make sure that the wheels are correctly set'''.   The wheels should be fully engaged in the dropouts and centered in the wheel arches if brake balancing is to work.  If they are not centered, then this might be your problem as opposed to the brakes themselves; so correct the matter first.

::*'''Inflate the tires first.''' Before adjusting the brakes, make sure that the tires are properly inflated, since flat tires will affect the results. Metal rims can move as tire pressures change.

::*'''Preset the barrel adjusters'''. Before starting any cable length adjustments, first set the brake levers' barrel adjusters so that they are ''out by two full turns'', instead of being tightened all the way in.   This allows some fine adjustment in ''both'' directions at any stage, and will allow the cable to be slackened enough to release the wheel from the brake blocks when necessary.

::*'''Check that the rims are clean'''. Remove any dirt and oil from the rims, and if necessary clean them with detergent and wire wool, being careful to avoid the rubber of the tires.

::*'''Check the brake blocks for wear'''.   Make sure that the brake block contact areas have not been badly reduced.   If the surface grooves on the blocks have been removed by wear, then replacing them will improve braking greatly.   When replacing them be sure to replace both at the same time.

&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin:0px;line-height:1em;padding:0px;&quot;&gt;The Full Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
----
The full adjustment procedure is summarized below but it should be emphasized that slight adjustments might solve the problem.   In any case, it is quite usual to repeat balancing at various stages throughout the adjustment. 

::*'''Position each brake block''' so that it presses ''cleanly'' onto its wheel rim.   

::*'''Set the brake cable length''' to ''roughly'' establish the brake blocks' clearance.

::*'''Adjust the brake-arm balance screws''' so that both blocks close onto the rims ''together''.

::*'''Fine-adjust the handlebar barrel-adjuster''' for the required brake performance. 

::*'''Test the brakes''' both off and on the road.

These above points are all described in some detail in the text that follows.

=== Brake Block Alignment ===
----
[[Image:Block Alignment Drawing 4.jpg|frame|Fig 3. Block Alignment.   Note the direction of ''''toeing-in''''.]]'''The brake blocks need to be aligned with the metal rims'''.   Refer to Figs 1 and  3.   The leading edge of each block should be slightly closer to the rim than its trailing edge.  This prevents brake squealing and is called &quot;toeing-in&quot;.  Use a coin, a credit card, or any other thin material under the back end of the block while adjusting it.   Some suggest tying an elastic band temporarily to the trailing end of the block to allow more freedom while working.

To make the adjustment, slacken the screw that holds the block.   Usually a 5mm hex wrench is used.   Swing the brake arm in so that the block is pressed squarely against the metal rim, and then re-tighten it while holding the block hard with your &quot;toeing-in&quot; device in place.   Avoid the rubber of the wheel; the block should contact only the rim.   The block should be parallel to the rim, noting that some blocks are curved to fit its shape.   Do one block at a time, and just let each arm relax after the block is set.   If there is insufficient clearance to work or if you intend adjusting the cable length later in any case, then unhook the cable bridge (Figure 1, D) or undo the cable clamp (Figure 1, F) before carrying out the work.

=== Block Clearance ===
----
'''Decide whether or not the block clearance is correct by trying the feel of the brake lever'''. (Figure 2, D).  The brake should feel responsive without too much handbrake slack prior to the start of braking.   Some mountain bike V-brakes might need only a 1mm gap, while many other brakes need about 2mm.   If in doubt, refer to your bicycle handbook.   If a ''significant'' adjustment is needed, resetting the cable length should do it.   If a ''small'' change will do then use the brake lever barrel-adjusters on the handlebars, as described in the  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Brakes/Adjusting_brakes#Fine_Adjustments  '''Fine Adjustments''']   below.

==== Rough Adjustment ====
:*'''To reset the cable length slacken the brake cable clamp''' (Figure 1, F),  usually with a 5mm hex wrench, and let the brake side arms relax.     Move both of the side arms toward the rims until the blocks are about the right distance away; although you can do this in any way that you like, it is easiest to hold one arm against its rim and adjust the other's gap so that it is about ''double'' the intended block clearance.   Pull up any cable slack and re-tighten the cable clamp.  This may take a couple of tries to get the blocks close to, but not touching, the rim.   In any case, fine adjustments can be made with the barrel adjusters (Figure 2, B), provided not too much range is expected of them.

:*'''In the absence of documentation about the brakes''', aim for the combined clearance of the two blocks on v-brakes to be about 2mm; this will give 1mm gaps after balancing.   For less demanding brakes, assume about double this figure.   Some manufacturers provide internet sites with technical information of this kind.   A good example of a manufacturer's brake manual can be found in pdf format [http://techdocs.shimano.com/media/techdocs/content/cycle/SI/Capreo/BR-F700/SI-8CU0A_EN_v1_m56577569830604449.PDF '''here'''], and its parts list  [http://techdocs.shimano.com/media/techdocs/content/cycle/EV/bikecomponents/BR/EV-BR-M420-1901_v1_m56577569830609070.pdf '''here'''].

==== Fine Adjustment ====
:'''Fine adjustments are made with the handbrakes' barrel-adjusters.''' (Figure 2, B).   If not on the handlebars they may be near the brake blocks.   If the brakes just need a ''small'' adjustment, this may be all that you need.   

:*'''Barrel adjustment''';  after undoing the barrel-adjuster's locknut (Figure 2, C) the brake blocks can be moved by turning the barrel screw (Figure 2, B).   To move both brake blocks ''inward'', simply ''unscrew'' the barrel (counter clockwise).  Conversely, to move both brake blocks ''outward'', turn the barrel ''inward'', (clockwise).   This feature gives a much finer adjustment of cable length than setting the cable clamp.   Check the feeling of the brake frequently while getting the adjustment right, and tighten the locknut again when it is done.  Lastly, decide whether or not to re-balance the brake arms.  

:*'''Notes on barrel range''':   There are differences of opinion as to the ideal amount of thread to leave on the adjusters when the brake adjustments are complete.   The main ideas are these: 
:**'''For maximum barrel range'''; screw the barrel adjusters all the way in ''before'' making any brake adjustments to allow the widest range of ''inward'' adjustment of the blocks.   This might be the case where compensating for block wear is the main consideration.
:**'''To unhook the brakes;''' for a wide wheel removal, you might wish that you left more play in the cable.   That is to say, provided that the barrel has always about two turns of thread showing, then tightening it all the way in will allow the cable nipple, (the end of the cable guide), to be unhooked from the housing detent without touching the cable clamp.  Some find this method useful. Decide which is best for your routine.

=== Brake Block Balance ===
----
''''The brake arms should be adjusted so that both blocks apply pressure to the rim at the same time'''.   As a result, at balance, there is no sideways displacement of the wheel during braking.   Although slight imbalance is not ''always'' critical, displacement of the wheel by even a small amount can cause damage when small-clearance devices such as distance counters are installed on the spokes.  Balancing the spring tensions keeps the wheel centered even during braking.

For brakes like V-brakes, there is a small screw near the bottom of each brake arm to adjust the spring tension.( Fig 5).   It is often  a  posidrive screw, (M4x6mm) , with a tightening insert.   Turning this screw ''clockwise'' will cause the brake block to move ''outward'' slightly, and turning it ''anticlockwise'' will cause the block to move ''inward''.   As one block moves, so does the other, to maintain the distance between them.   Adjust these until the clearances are about equal.   In this way, operating the brake causes the blocks to reach the rim at about the same time.

Be careful not to withdraw the screws too far since they may not be captive.   At the other extreme, if a screw is too far in, the brake arm will bind; if a brake arm seems inactive, or unresponsive, this might be the case, or the spring may just have popped out of its slot.   Try to avoid the limits and to reach a balance with the screws near their mid-range.   This is easier than it sounds since making an identical adjustment on both screws will leave the balance unchanged.   Brakes usually can be balanced unless the wheel is not centered in the wheel-arch.   (See Common Brake Problems on this page for more on this).

Test the brakes on the spinning wheels before riding.   If these work well enough then test the brakes again by riding the bicycle in a quiet place.   The brakes should stop the bicycle decisively in a fairly short distance.   Some v-brakes in particular have a short stopping distance; on these you should not need a deep pull on the brake lever for a good braking effect since this is a sign that the blocks are set too far from the rims.   In any case be sure to refer to the manual if there is doubt.

Figure 4 is an extract of maximum braking distances as given by the CTC Hire Standard, that is itself related to the content of British Standard BS6102/1 for '''new'''  bikes.   The CTC standard is an attempt to consider '''used'''  bikes, as opposed to bikes at the point of first sale.   In any case, these stopping distances are useful until such time as the European standards properly address the issue.

The most common reason for long braking distances, apart from maladjusted brakes, is the degradation of the brake block surface area.   Be sure if replacing these to replace both together.

===Common Brake Problems===
----

====Balance Problems====
[[Image:Brake Drawing 3.jpg|frame|Fig 5. Typical Brake Layout.   Note the location of the balance screws.]] 
Sometimes, despite best efforts, the brake arms will not balance.   The spring balance screws are designed to have limited range since they are only expected to handle the ''difference'' between the arm tensions to achieve balance.   So, faults that only slightly bind any part of the braking system can cause trouble with balancing.   Possible faults include:   The lack of general lubrication, the binding of brake arms, the slipping of faulty adjustment screws, unseated brake-arm springs, unseated housing ferrules or nipples, or a quick-release wheel that needs re-clamped closer to the  centre of the wheel arch.   See these points below.[[Image:Brake Block Parts.jpg|frame|Fig 6. Typical Brake Block Assembly.   Note the washer padding for a persistent balance problem.   The wide and narrow concave washers are sometimes interchanged to accommodate available block designs.]]
:'''Lubrication'''
:Small changes in brake arm resistance are often corrected by lubrication alone.   As a last resort, to identify the source of binding, undo the cables at the brake levers, and at the cable clamp; this can isolate the three parts of the system.   In this way, each section could be studied without being affected by the other parts.   Any roughness in operation could  then be observed.   Many problems of this kind however, are solved by routine cable lubrication.    

:The moving parts of brake assemblies, ''with the exception of blocks and rims'', should be oiled.   Use a light machine oil of the type sold as 'bicycle oil'.   Brake lever assemblies, cables, and the brake arms should all be lubricated.   A cable is oiled by dropping oil onto the cable with the brake lever operated to expose it.   A single drop of oil at the point where a cable enters a housing will travel the length of the cable by capillary action. Rub some oil also onto any other visible steel cables.   When the brake arms are removed, do not forget to clean and grease the  mounting pins before reassembly.   The rotating parts at the back of the brake arm's pivot-assembly should not be disassembled, though a drop of bike oil is useful when they seem a bit gritty in operation.

:'''Balance Screws'''
:The balance screws work by pushing and releasing the coiled ends of the springs, so increasing and decreasing their strength.  However, things sometimes go wrong.

:In some brakes the brake arm binds up when the screw is all the way in.    In others, the screw slips off the end of its spring because of bent parts or poor design.   When either of these things happens it will be difficult or impossible to balance the brakes. 

:If the balance screws seem to lack range of adjustment. then look for these problems on the underside of the brake arms.   In the case of binding screws it is simple to release the screw a bit and reattempt the balance.  Bear in mind that carrying out an identical adjustment on ''both'' balance screws should leave the balance unchanged, so unless there is some other problem, it will usually be possible to correct binding in this way. A better fix for a ''binding screw'' is to add a washer under the ''balance screw'' head to avoid binding in the future.   This limit should be set to avoid the worst case; found usually with the block against the rim. If the screws are ever replaced, avoid using screws that are longer, unless the extra is padded out as mentioned above.   This will avoid brake binding.   Balance screws are usually fitted with nylon inserts to make sure that they are fairly tight, though a drop of thread tightening fluid might also help avoid their getting lost on the road.     

:Sometimes the spring on a brake arm slips out of its groove, and this is seen as one side of the brakes doing nothing at all.   This happens at times when the bridge has been undone.   Fix it by moving the spring back behind the arm into its groove.   At other times, the springs of cheaper brakes can slip off the balance screws, but this is largely a fabrication problem; consider a new set of brakes if this happens, since these springs are not easily reworked.  

:Brake arms have location pins to fix them to the flats on the bike frame.   The frame often has three holes to choose from but some frame mountings have only one.   The hole chosen decides the spring strength and the work needed to pull the brake lever.   If the pins of each brake arm in a set are located in different positions, then the resulting tensions cannot be balanced.   If there is an obvious imbalance in the brake arms and the arms were recently reinstalled, then consider this possibility.   Although some frames are provided with three holes for the location pins, some brakes only work on one particular position, so take note during any disassembly as to which holes were used. 

:'''Obstructed Cables and Housings'''
:It has been noted that accessories such as straps, lock cables, and bungee cords are easily forgotten, and can bear upon brake cables in such a way as to make the balance seem impossible.   The same condition is possible when the parts at the ends of cable housings (ferrules), become unseated during brake work; the entire brake balance suffers.   Baggage on the front handlebars can kink cable housings, and a similar binding can be found in folding bicycles; in the latter case, when the bike is unfolded, make sure that any tight loops near the hinge points are straightened before making off.  If the change is fairly sudden, and in particular after parking the bike or unhooking the cable bridge, then look for these simple solutions.    

:'''Wheel not Centered'''
:Many brake balance problems are associated with wheel positioning.   There are at least three situations to consider:
:*When a quick-release wheel is positioned within the wheel arch it can happen that it is not fully engaged in the dropouts.   This happens when a wheel is installed with the bike in a stand or otherwise above ground.   A gap is often visible.   This problem causes the brake blocks to close on the rubber of the wheels instead of the rims, so it is not subtle.   Reset the wheel. 
:*Brakes are adjusted for the quick release lever positioned on the ''left'' of the bike.   When a ''front'' wheel is wrongly installed with the clamp on the ''right'', the ''existing'' brake balance will be upset.   Reinstall the wheel with the lever on the left.
:*When a wheel's skewer-clamp is tightened it is important to hold the wheel in a correctly centered position during the process. Bad centering can also cause the bike to run poorly, might feel a bit heavy, and can make shifts a bit less certain. The two springs, one on each end of the skewer, (both with their pointed ends inwards) are there to help the skewer start off in the center.   The springs are not strictly necessary for the skewer to work, and as such they might be missing.  In any case a wheel can be centered by adjusting ''both'' the lever and the locknut. One way to do this is to slacken both ends until the exposed screw threads look about equal, then tighten both the locknut and the lever a little bit at a time.   Make final adjustments in the same way until resistance is first noted when the closing of the lever approaches the horizontal.   Some tires have a center ridge that is  useful for checking that the wheel is centered.   When this problem is corrected the brake balancing adjustments will come into range, and the bike might even run better.

:'''Brake Arm Washers'''
:Each brake arm has a brake block and on its screw thread there are various washers.   One of these washers is wider than the other, and they are interchanged by some users, depending on the kind of brake pull that they want.   If the brake blocks (pads) were recently changed or removed, check that there is symmetry in the positions of their wider washers.   If one pad has the wide washer near to the pad and the other has it nearest to the  nut then the distance of each brake block to the rim will be different and they will not balance.

:'''Badly Worn Brake Blocks'''
:If one brake block has been worn down much more than the other then that might affect whether or not the brakes balance, especially if it is combined with some other trivial factor.   Inspect the blocks and if changing them be sure to change both at the same time.    Generally speaking, if a brake block has been worn down so that any part of any of any of its grooves is no longer clear then they both need replaced.       

:'''All Else Fails'''
:If the brakes balance, but at opposite screw extremes, then further adjustments are prevented.  First consider all of the '''above''' solutions; i.e., is the tighter of the two binding, etc.?   If you are stuck with unmatched springs in the brake arms, (rare, since the set that came with the bike are matched in manufacture), it may be possible to get the screws back into mid-range with a washer or two.    Add thin 6mm washers, as shown in Figure 6, to the brake block assembly that habitually has the '''wider''' of the two gaps.   Adjust the number of washers until the balance is achieved closer to the balance screws' midpoints.   When all else has failed, and a fix of this kind is being considered, do not forget to consider the buying of a new set of brakes, and getting the bike shop to first take a look.

====Soft Brakes====
If brakes are softer than intended, even after adjustment, then it might be that the toeing-in is excessive.  Also, if wheel wobble causes rubbing on the brake blocks, widening the gaps will necessarily soften the brakes.   See the comments below.      

:'''Excessive Toeing-in'''
:It is impossible to set firm brakes if the blocks cannot be set close to the rims.   For brakes needing ''narrow''' clearances, e.g. 1mm to 1.5mm, the toeing-in needs also to be narrower than usual.   If the toeing-in were set to the usual 1mm more than the front of the block, then for the above example, the average clearance for each block would be 1.5mm to 2mm, and the brake would feel soft.   Thus, the toeing-in needs to be ''minimal'' if a firm or hard brake is required.   In fact some brake manufacturers recommend no toeing-in for their products.   Brakes that use ''wider'' settings by design, are affected  less by toeing-in.    

:'''Wheel Wobble'''
:Wheel wobble causes repetitive brake noise but most brake noises are unimportant.   The most common cause is debris from the road.   Also, new tires have rubber tails on them that rub on brake blocks, but these can be trimmed.   Badly centered wheels can  also cause some rubbing of the brakes.   It is as well to check this if the problem follows recent wheel work.   These noises are not serious.  

:If there is even a slight wheel wobble then brake block clearances will need to be widened to avoid the repetitive rubbing noise.   Although some wheel wobble is inevitable, when it is ''excessive'' then repairs may be required.   In that case see:  [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Wheels_and_Tires/Truing_a_bicycle_wheel|'''Truing a bicycle wheel''']] , in an attempt to handle it yourself, or consider getting some advice from your bike shop. 

:For brakes that need ''narrow'' clearances, say 1mm, the issue of wheel balance is more critical.   Widening the block clearances to 2mm, to accommodate a slight wobble makes softer brakes, but in most cases these will still be safe.   However, if the wobble worsens, then continuing to widen the clearances will lead to ineffective brakes long before the wheel itself becomes unusable.   Brakes designed for ''wider'' clearances will accommodate more wobble before the brakes suffer.

==Mending a broken chain==

Newer, narrower chains and wider chains for single speed or three speed bicycles often have special links for removing the chain, but the chain tool is still needed to remove excess links when replacing chains.

A chain tool can be used to push out the rivet which joins the plates of the chain together.  Many chain tools have two positions the chain will fit- make sure the plate furthest from the extractor pin is supported by the tool. Once this is done the chain can be replaced or re-assembled as a shorter chain. Most chains will have enough slack to allow removal of a few links without making the chain too short.

Avoid pushing the rivet all the way out, it should remain lodged in one of the outer plates.  A small portion of the rivet left protruding on the inside of the plate can hold the chain together during reinstallation.  Use the same position in the chain tool, with the chain plate furthest from the chain tool's pin supported, and push the rivet back into place.  After reinstallation, the link will usually be too stiff- leading to chain skip unless loosened. The other position in two-position chain tools, with the closer plate supported by the tool, is used for loosening tight links. Force the side of the rivet that protrudes more into the link to loosen the link.  Alternatively, grasping the chain on both sides of the tight link and flexing the chain in and out will loosen the link.

==Note==

Although they're made of metal, chains seem to &quot;stretch&quot; as the links wear.  This will cause them to not engage on the gears properly (they will hook on to the middle or top of the tooth, instead of the bottom of the groove).  This will also cause the gear teeth to wear down.  

To test for excessive wear on a chain, open a link and remove the chain.  Then try to flex the chain sideways, in the direction it is not supposed to bend.  If you can make anything more than a 1/8 arc (for example, if you can make a half circle or if you can touch the ends), then your chain is worn and should be replaced.  Alternatively, measure a straight section of chain under slight tension.  Standard links of chain measure one inch when new-  if 11 links of chain measure 11 1/8&quot; (283 mm) or more the chain should be replaced.

If you only replace the chain and not the gears, the chain may skip.  For this reason, it is best to replace both at the same time (the front gears are not as affected by this because they are bigger and the chain doesn't pass over each tooth as many times).  Replacing the chain more often, when 11 links measure 11 1/16&quot; (281 mm), will allow the gears to be reused .

==Avoiding Chain Wear==

To prevent such wear, avoid using gear combinations that stretch the chain diagonally.

Also change gears only when you are turning the pedals.  Remember to gear down when coming to a stop.

==Regular bicycle maintenance==

Performing regular maintenance on a [[w:bicycle|bicycle]] will improve its performance and longevity, and reduce the risk of breakdowns. The exact schedule for a particular bicycle will depend on how it is used: its weekly mileage, the weather conditions, road (or off road) surface conditions and so on. Most parts will need attention and possible replacement every year or two; if this is done, however, a bicycle can be maintained in good working order for decades.

Bicycle inspection &amp; maintenance can be roughly broken down into four categories. Each includes clean, inspect, adjust, lubricate and repair as necessary. The primary difference between them is the depth or level of each task and sub-task.

# Pre-ride
# Post-ride
# Tune-up
# Overhaul

The schedule given here is a starting point for an average bike, assuming daily or weekly use; you will soon adjust this based on your own experience. 

'''Every ride:'''
*Check that the tires are inflated (a quick pinch to ensure they are hard generally suffices)
*Check both wheels will rotate without sticking
*Squeeze both brakes to make sure they engage properly ''(this is especially important if you have been working on the bike and may have disconnected the brake cables)''
*Check for obvious loose parts; if you have panniers or removable child seats make sure they're properly attached 
*Check you have working lights, a lock and a key if you will need them before you return
*After the ride, if the moving parts have got muddy or picked up road salt, give the bike a quick hose down. It's much easier doing it now than after it has dried! 
(washing with a bike cleaner helps get rid of dried on and hard to get off grime.)

'''Once a week:'''
*Lubricate the chain
*Re-inflate the tires to the correct pressure.
*Rotate wheels to check that they are in [[Bicycle Repair/Truing a bicycle wheel|true]]. Replace any broken spokes - other spokes will break and the wheel will be permanently bent if ridden in this condition. 

'''Quarterly:'''
*Check the [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Brakes/Adjusting brakes|brakes]] to ensure they are correctly adjusted, and that the pads are not worn.
*Check derailleur adjustment.
*Check screws or bolts holding attachments such as mudguards, racks, bottles etc. are tight.
*Check brake and gear cables for fraying or rusting, and lubricate. 
*Grease seat post. It may not technically be a moving part, but it is not desirable for it to become permanently stuck.
*Adjust the saddle height and position if necessary. (when crank arm is in-line with seat tube and ball of foot is inline with pedal axle, knee should be slightly bent, then place heel on pedal, leg should then be completely straight. Hips should not wobble when riding bike, Lower seat if this occurs)
*Check tires for signs of wear, bulges or splitting. (replace immediately)
*Check handlebars are aligned properly with front wheel.
*Check reflectors (if required) are still attached
*Check the chain for [[Bicycles/Maintenance_and_Repair/Chains/Checking_chain_wear|wear]]

'''At least every two years:'''
*Replace the chain and front or rear sprockets
*Complete dis-assembly, [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/General Information/Cleaning parts|cleaning]], and lubricate all moving parts.
*Check bottom bracket and wheel hubs for excessive play and replace if worn.
*Check derailleur jockey wheels for wear, replace them if worn. '''*TIP*''' If the &quot;teeth&quot; of the jockey wheels or front or rear sprockets look sharp and pointy, Replace. (if rear cassette is worn, you will need to replace chain at the same time)
*Grease metal-to-metal contact points.
*Check saddle for splitting, and handlebar grips or tape for perishing or fraying
*Check headset; tighten or replace bearings as necessary

== Accessories ==
I'm of two minds about including a section on accessories (someone else put it on the main page). There are a few pieces of advice that can be offered. Still, with the great variety of accessories out there I'm most inclined to say [[w:RTFM|RTFM]].[[User:Dhodges|Dhodges]] 00:33, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)

== Organization ==
I'd like to propose a reorg of this into:

* Tools
* Supplies
* Basic Tasks (where things like removing pedals go)
* Repairs
* Maintenance tasks

with a distinction that a Repair gets you back on the road, a Maintenance task improves something that's degraded, and a Basic task is a component of either of the above.

:Nice to see someone else taking an interest. I'm more concerned with getting actual repairs written up, but hey go for it. [[User:Dhodges|Dhodges]] 22:27, 10 Mar 2004 (UTC)

==Commuting bike==
It's perhaps outside the scope of this book but I'd like to put together some advice for selecting a commuting bike. The content would go well alongside advice for fitting mudguards, fitting rear racks and other commuting essentials. Would you like to add a section for me to get started? --[[User:DavidBoden|DavidBoden]] 19:12, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

==Illustrations==
Text only is a bit hard to follow, we could do with some more pictures (like on the [[spoke wrench]]). I've some tools at home, so I could do a few pictures, but only of the basic stuff. [[User:MWF|MWF]] 09:20, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

==Diagram(s) with labels needed.==
Thanks great start.  I repaired my friend's bike like most of us do.  Found very brocken sprocket in rear derailer (one of the two where the chain does the S bend, where the slack is taken up), removed it, with it in hand asked for a replacement at a bike shop, and was told I had to buy the whole rear derailer unit!!  Until owner came out and pulled out recycled replacements.  Inoperable bike totally fixed.  Cost me $2.  I didn't RTFM.  Under most circumstances I like to have a diagram and name of the part so I appear to know what I am talking about, or can show I have made an attempt to research.  Looking and sounding like a newbie can be very expensive.  I hope someone can put in a diagram of the typical gear change bike with labels of parts to make phone calls easier.

==Organization==
Wouldn't it be better to organize the book based on the part of the bike being repaired rather than the skill level needed to perform the repair?  Ex: Chapter 1: Wheels, Chapter 2: Brakes, Chapter 3: Drivetrain, etc.  Each repair could also then be given a difficulty rating, such as on a one to ten scale, as well as a list of tools needed for the repair (a master list of tools at the beginning or end would still be helpful).  I believe this is how most repair manuals are written and I almost just did it, but I decided it would be better to discuss it here first.  --[[User:FurciferRNB|FurciferRNB]] 10 October 2005
:I'm an utter newbie here, but that seems very sensible to me. --[[User:Danny Wilde|Danny Wilde]] 14:38, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

:I think it might be useful to provide both an index by part and the old system that broke tasks up by difficulty and the frequency they need  to be performed. The current system is more useful as a reference when your bike breaks, but the old way is more useful to a beginner who wants to learn or buy tools. --[[User:Dmonego|Dmonego]] 04:47, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::It seems like we almost need two 'streams' for the maintenance/repair part of the book: a reference manual that can be 'dipped into' at any point, and a learn-about-your-bike sort of book, which reads well cover-to-cover and incrementally introduces bicycle parts and concepts.  A organisation that lets the reader go quickly to the bit they need isn't any good for someone who doesn't know what they need.  Similarly, the more experienced mechanic just wants to look something up doesn't want to trawl through all the 'this is a chainring' introductory material.  --[[User:Samwilson|Samwilson]] 02:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

==Reorg==
Based on input above from [[User:FurciferRNB|FurciferRNB]] and [[User:Danny Wilde|Danny Wilde]] as well as my own consensus, I've reorganized this book to reflect part-groups of a bike rather than difficulty level of the task.  I think that this way users will more easily be able to find the information they're looking for.  I still think difficulty should be reflected though.  I suggest that sections in each chapter should be listed in order of difficulty from easiest to hardest. For example, in the chapter on 'Tires &amp; wheels', 'Fixing a flat' would come before 'Truing a wheel.'  I moved the listing of tools and supplies to its own chapter and I moved the manufacturer links to the Appendix.

Also, I reorganized the Bicyles page, of which this page is (has been) a module.  I see this page, as well as those listed with it on the Bicycles page, as volumes in a library, where each volume should be able to stand on its own as much as possible.

With respect to [[User:DavidBoden|DavidBoden's]] comment about equipment for a commuting bike, I think that information would go well in the volume on 'Equipment &amp; accessories'.  I'd also, personally, like to see more info on this topic, with maybe focus on what type of riding you do (i.e. commuting, touring, MTBing, BMXing, etc.)

Lastly, I've cleaned up this discussion page a bit to make the threads easier to read.  Overall, I'd love to see some feedback and improvements on this book's reorganization. Thanks. [[User:Mindfrieze|Mindfrieze]] 18:12, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

== Company Specific Manuals ==

--[[User:Georgio8|Georgio8]] ([[User talk:Georgio8|talk]]) 15:15, 18 March 2010 (UTC) I notice that the Appendix has a list of links to Company Specific Manuals. 

Some members of the Moulton Bicycle Club ([http://groups.yahoo.com/group/moultonbicycle/ moultonbicycle yahoo list]) would like to use this book itself as a place to hold information that we have collected but haven't yet posted anywhere about the maintenance of the (many) different models of Moulton. So we're wondering whether it would be in the spirit of this book to add a Moulton section to the Appendix.

:Georgio8, I say go for it.  This hasn't been a very active book over the last five years, so drop your info in, and we'll see how it works out.  --[[User:Mindfrieze|Mindfrieze]] ([[User talk:Mindfrieze|talk]]) 14:34, 29 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

I believe the word tire has been inadvertantly substituted for tube in many places in the following paragraph which is found at the end of the notes section under Flat Repair. I placed (TUBE) where there appears to be an error.

&quot;Because tire(TUBE) prices have come down dramatically, it is generally suggested to replace the tire(TUBE) after one patch job, especially for high-pressure tires. You should still have a patch kit or spare tube with you on long rides. You can cut the old tire(TUBE) into strips of rubber and use it for a variety of things, including bungee-type straps.&quot;

Unfortunately, I disagree with this comment. While it may be less expensive to an individual to replace a tube after one patch, the cost to the environment is heavy in materials and energy for every tube produced. My experience is that a tube can be patched many times before it's ready to become a bungee cord.

== Ontario fuel stations seem to go above 35 psi ==

Pumps at fuel station only inflate to 35 psi? In [[Wikipedia:Ontario|Ontario]], the pumps at fuel stations seem to inflate quite well and, often better than the mini-pump that I carry with me. [[User:WbZurp|WbZurp]] 14:31, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

It is better to carry a small pump than to look around for a service station pump, unless you don't have a flat. The 35 lb. statement isn't correct. It's easy to (b o o m !) blow out a tyre with a high pressure pump. There is no standard: there may be no air at the service station. If it's there, it may cost or be free and its pressure can indeed be too low. So what's said is essentially correct: it might not be a good idea to count on the gas station.

==Suggested amendment which may alter sentence sense==

I was wondering whether the sentence &quot;the material to repair a tube is tiny compared to the entire tube itself&quot; should be changed to &quot;the cost of the material to repair a tube is tiny compared to the cost of the entire tube itself&quot;...? Or is this is the sense that the author intended. Forgive me for being pedantic but as a writer I know how annoying minor edits can be if they change the sense of your sentence!

Your instincts are correct.  Don't feel shy about making such corrections yourself.

== Best structure for this topic? ==
There are several scenarios in which one might need to fix a flat: in the shop, on the road, with a road bike, with a MTB, using a patches or a whole tube, etc.  The article was originally written for the type of bike with which the author was most familiar, and in a first-person style.  So a couple of questions: 
#Do we want to keep the first-person style?
#Covering all options in one set of instructions can be confusing.  Should there be different sets of instructions for each scenario?

==Working on it==
Started working on this page.   If there are comments of interest, now is the time.  Does anybody know about an outer tire rubber filler that will bond to the cladding for fixing tears?   It seems like something that would sell!   You can boot the inside but most would be happier fixing the outsides too.   (Reduced water ingress.) .

== Picture of bike showing parts... ==

Hi, I put on january a picture, can you help me to find it
Thanks...
--[[User:Gengiskanhg|Gengiskanhg]] 23:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::Hi, that image was probably added before the page was moved from WIKIPEDIA.   This history only starts on the beginning of January 2005.    If you know some part of the ''name'' of the image it might be found in [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~tangotango/mayflower/ MAYFLOWER IMAGE SEARCH].

==Other brake problem causes==

Please leave a note here if you know of other brake problems that may be of interest for the page.

Alternatively, add a section.

Armchair, 16:20 GMT , 27 September 2009

== Simplicity ==

The page starts with &quot;'''The brakes on bicycles are simple to adjust'''.&quot;, which already made me laugh. Then a couple paragraphs later:

:Bear in mind that the best way to learn the adjustment of brakes is to be shown by somebody while it is being done; in this way much of the mystery vanishes.
:The next best way is to follow a fairly stolid description of the sort below, which will get the job done with a little perseverance.

I see a certain contradiction in the lead. I would remove the first sentence. --[[User:Chealer|Chealer]] ([[User talk:Chealer|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chealer|contribs]]) 01:15, 6 October 2011 (UTC)


Hi,&lt;br&gt;
Whereas you say that you ''would'' remove a sentence, I also note that you did not! So pleased that my efforts amuse you - a little more effort and a bit less idle commentary would serve you and the writing community better![[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Armchair|contribs]]) 08:34, 27 December 2011 (UTC)

== Noodle ==

Super page. The pipe marked &quot;cable guide&quot; is a noodle, and the rubber item marked &quot;noodle&quot; is actually a boot

:Correct. I've edited the page, though I note that my edit is awaiting review. I made a similar correction to [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Cables and Housings|Cables and Housings]] (also awaiting review).

=Welcome!=
Welcome to the Dutch language course. Notice the arrows under the images of a number of cities where Dutch is spoken? Click on the arrow to hear how their names are pronounced in Dutch. There may be some surprises!

==Information about the course==
If you want more information on the course, here are a few pages that may give you that.
&lt;center&gt;

==The lessons==
If you want to jump right in and start learning: there are three types of lessons:
#''Main lessons'' concentrate mostly on conversations to introduce grammar
#''Practice lessons'' concentrate mostly on practicing grammar, vocabulary building, listening, quizzes
#''Cultural lessons'' teach language the fun way. Songs, stories, poems, videos etc.

There are three levels, each consisting of two cycles of four lessons each.

At the end of this level learners should have full command over Dutch grammar and syntax, including a number of special topics.

==''Special lessons''==
:This course is mostly based on (northern) standard Dutch, but it will at times go into the differences with other varieties. There are two special lessons that consider the relationship of northern standard Dutch with Afrikaans and Flemish

* [[/Lesson Afrikaans|'''Afrikaans''']] &amp;mdash; Comparison with Afrikaans, the language of South Africa and Namibia, and derived from Dutch. 
:Until 1928 it was seen as the same language as Dutch. Then both Dutch and Afrikaans became official languages of South Africa. Dutch ceased to have that role in 1961.
::[[Afrikaans]] has its own wikibook, if you wish to learn it.
* [[/Lesson Flemish|'''Vlaams''']] &amp;mdash; Flemish is a special case, not a language and not a dialect. It is commonly spoken in Flanders but has no official status or something comparable.

==Layout of the Course==
This textbook is intended to be a comprehensive course in the Dutch language for English speakers, but of course people who speak English as a second language are most welcome as well.

Early lessons emphasize conversational subjects and gradually introduce Dutch grammatical concepts and rules. In addition, sound files and illustrations accompany appropriate parts of each lesson.

===Requirements for the course===
::'''Financial''': This course does not cost you a dime.

::'''Audio''': Listening and speaking yourself are an important part of language acquisition. Therefore there are many sound files embedded in the course, so do make sure your computer or other device can play them. This includes using an appropriate ''browser''. The author is using Firefox. Chrome might work too, but Internet Explorer does not always show the sound buttons. 

::'''Flashcards''': We have added links to Quizlet data sets in parallel with each lesson through lesson10. Thus, all 24 lessons of the Beginner Level have Quizlet links. Registration for [https://quizlet.com Quizlet] is recommended (It is for free).

::'''Keyboard''': We also recommend that you install an international keyboard to deal more easily with the -rather few- diacritics that Dutch uses. For Microsoft operating systems [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306560 this] will tell you how to proceed.

===Structure of the course===
The course is divided in three levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. Each level consists of two cycles of 4 lessons each. At the beginner and intermediate level each lesson is accompanied by two parallel lessons: a ''practice'' lesson and a ''cultural'' lesson. That means that the beginner level comprises 2*4*3= 24 lessons in total. 

At the advanced level there are no parallel lessons. Starting from scratch, expect to arrive there in a year, depending on how intensivley you study. By that time you should be able to start picking your own things to read, newspapers, wikipedia articles, what have you.

===Parallel lessons===
The main lessons aim at introducing '''grammatical topics''' by means of conversations, interspersed with some exercises. Of course that is not sufficient to actually start speaking the language. Therefore each lesson is accompanied by:
:A parallel practice lesson 1&amp;rArr;1A that elaborates the material further in conversations, reading material, fill in the blank exercises, small quizzes, pronunciation drills etc., to '''practice''' the material in the main lesson and build up vocabulary. 
:A parallel example lesson 1&amp;rArr;Vb. 1 that uses pieces of literature, songs, nursery rhymes at times linked to YouTube videos to expose the reader to some '''Dutch cultural phenomena'''. In the earlier lessons the material is originally mostly intended for children who are acquiring the language in their playful way. In later lessons the material becomes a bit more adult and involves poetry and other forms of literature and some cultural and historical background information.

In addition there are pages intended to help build up vocabulary, some of which are interwoven in the practice lessons. Other ones are stand alone.

===Possible strategies===
Which way the reader wishes to use the book may vary. The recommended strategy for a beginner with no experience is:

Lesson 1 &gt; Lesson 1A -&gt; Vb. 1 -&gt; Lesson 2 &gt; Lesson 2A &gt;  Vb. 2 &gt;Lesson 3 &gt; Lesson 3A &gt;, etc.

People who have experience with other languages, grammars etc. might want to follow the order

Lesson 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; and on to the end of the basic text&lt;br&gt;

Others may want to start tackling the language in context of a situation and worry about grammar later might want to start with Lesson 1A or Example 1 and check back for the grammar in Lesson 1 later. But readers are encouraged to revisit pages they have worked on again and again, so the order may be more complicated than this.

For people who have been learning Dutch in other ways and want to revisit a certain topic there is an [[Dutch/Index|Index]] of grammatical and syntactic topics covered.

===Layout within main Lessons===
The following topics can typically be found in one of the main lessons:

#One or more conversations ('''''Gesprek''''') or stories ('''''Verhaal''''') in a colored box, usually with a sound button
#:The translation of these textual pieces is given in a drop down box. Words can also be underlined, and the reader can hover the mouse over {{C|such a underlined item|to see the translation}}.
#:A vocabulary box on the right hand side that can be opened for easy access to pronunciation, translation and links to WikiWoordenboek
#One or more grammar ('''''Grammatica''''') lessons covering elements of Dutch grammar, with examples often drawn from the conversation, story, or study materials.
#Sections ('''''Uw beurt - Your turn''') with exercises pertaining to the material of various kinds:
#:Fill in the blank
#:Pronunciation drills
#:Translation assignments
#:Modifying sentences
#Illustrations of concepts related to the story usually with a sound button
#A list of words ('''''Woordenschat''''') and phrases introduced in the lesson, usually in the conversation, story, or study presentations. including sound files
#A link to Quizlet with the vocabulary taught (under construction)
#A synopsis of what the reader should have gained, including a cumulative vocabulary count (under construction)

===Layout in the practice lessons===

There are often additional texts, many exercises of various sorts and short quizzes to practice what was taught in the main lesson or to repeat what was taught in the lessons before. To further expand vocabulary students may be asked to go to one of the vocabulary pages to study words related to a certain topic. Quizlet links provide another way to brush up on vocabulary

===Layout in the example lessons===

In these lessons we will have a look at rhymes, poems, songs etc. Often the student is referred to a YouTube video to watch in order to practice oral understanding and expand vocabulary in the context of Dutch culture. Quizlet links provide another way to brush up on vocabulary.

===Quizzes===
Short quizzes are integrated into the practice lessons, but there are also longer quizzes at the end of the two cycles of the Beginner Level.

===Rate of acquisition of vocabulary===
Each lesson -its two parallel lessons included- contains on average about 120 new terms. At the end of the Beginner Level the student should know a little over one thousand terms.

===The Student and the Lesson===
The text is designed to constitute a comprehensive course of study in the Dutch language. Each lesson should be read thoroughly and mastered before moving on. Substantial text in Dutch is included and the student should read all of it, not once, but multiple times. In most cases sound files are given as an arrow button; they should be listened to multiple times as well, both while reading the text simultaneously, and -once the content is understood- with eyes closed. Complete translations into English are included only in selected places or they are hidden in a drop down box. Most of the text should first be translated by the student using his or her acquired vocabulary and the vocabulary presented at the bottom of each lesson and/or in collapsed boxes in the right hand margin of the text. Hints about the meaning of new, underlined words can also be obtained by the {{C|hover method|that allows students to see an instant translation}}.

As the Dutch is read (out loud is better), the student must succeed in gaining an understanding of the meaning of each sentence, and the role each word plays in establishing that meaning. To the beginner, there will seem to be many words in a Dutch sentence that are out of place or even redundant or unnecessary. These add subtleties to the language that will make sense eventually. But it is important to experience these subtleties from the very beginning.

There are exercises interspersed throughout the main lesson with additional ones in the practice lessons. They are of various nature. Translation exercises, pronunciation drills, fill-in-the-blanks, adapt a word form, swap to items etc.

==The Dutch Language==
[[File:Idioma neerlandés.PNG|thumb|170px|Language area in Europe]]
Dutch (''Nederlands'') is a member of the western group of the Germanic languages. It is spoken primarily in the Netherlands, and in a major part of both Belgium and Surinam. It has about 23 million mother tongue speakers and another 5 million second language speakers. Continue reading about the Dutch language and its history at [[w:Dutch_language|Wikipedia]].

===Dialects===
As a standard language Dutch is a relatively young phenomenon. The standard is based on a variety of dialects that are much older and show considerable differences not only in pronunciation but even in grammar and syntax. This holds for many languages, including for English as spoken in the UK. 
[[File:Map of the Netherlands highlighting the Great Rivers.svg|thumb|170px|De grote rivieren]] 
By urbanization, suburbanization and the influence of the mass media the standard language has been gaining ground at the cost of the dialects for over a century, so that it is now the mother tongue of most speakers. Others are typically perfectly bilingual in their regional tongue and the standard language. But in the way that the standard is spoken there are many regional and social differences in pronunciation or even in syntax and grammar. In Bruges (Flanders), Rotterdam (Netherlands) or Paramaribo (Suriname) Dutch will sound as different as English does in Edinburgh, London or Indianapolis. This course aims at teaching Dutch that would be acceptable to most if not all speakers but will point out a number of important differences that non-native speakers are likely to encounter in their interaction with native speakers.

A major division in the dialects is formed by ''de grote rivieren'' the great rivers that run through the Netherlands from east to west on their way to the North Sea as shown in the map. The course is mostly based on Northern standard Dutch, because that is most readily accepted under all speakers, but it will point out some important differences at times and also give examples of other varieties.

===A dynamic language===
Dutch has undergone far more sweeping changes in grammar and syntax in the last century or two than either English or German. It has lost most of its case endings and much of one of the three original genders (feminine). This has led to some interesting shifts in its grammar and syntax. Some of these developments are still taking place today. This means that Dutch grammar is less set in stone than the reader may be familiar with from other grammars. Occasionally we will have to discuss the evolution rather than the creature to explain modern Dutch usage.

===Dutch and English===
If you are an English speaker unfamiliar with Dutch, you may be surprised to learn that English and Dutch are closely related languages and share many words that are very similar. This is particularly true for everyday words in English that are Anglo-Saxon (i.e. [[w:Germanic languages|Germanic]]) in origin.  After 1066 English has absorbed a lot of (Norman) French. Dutch also has been exposed to contact with first vulgar Latin and then French, but the French influence has been less pervasive.

Consider the following list of English words followed by their Dutch counterparts:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| arm ~ ''arm''
| begin! ~ ''begin!''
| book ~ ''boek''
| cat ~ ''kat''
| father ~ ''vader''
| finger ~ ''vinger''
| house ~ ''huis''
|-
| hand ~ ''hand''
| man ~ ''man''
| mother ~ ''moeder''
| mouse ~ ''muis''
| name ~ ''naam''
| son ~ ''zoon''
| winter ~ ''winter''
|}
Many words of French origin have entered both languages and are quite recognizable:

:communication ~ ''communicatie''
:proclaim ~ ''proclameren''

But in many cases Dutch retains a Germanic word, sometimes aside the Latin one:

:proclaim ~ ''uitroepen''

English spelling has conserved many now silent consonants, e.g. ''gh'' in ''light''. This may have been an obstacle when learning to write English but when learning Dutch the investment pays off. Dutch has ''licht'' and the ''ch'' is very much still pronounced as a guttural fricative /x/ like in German Bach or Scottish Loch.

Some words are even completely the same. (''[[Dutch/Vocabulary/True friends|true friends]]'')

Of course, even words whose spelling is no different in English and Dutch may be pronounced quite differently or mean something different (''[[Dutch/Vocabulary/False friends|false friends]]''):

:'''door''' ~ ''deur''
:through, by ~ '''''door'''''

:'''worst''' ~ ''ergst, slechtst''
:sausage ~ '''''worst'''''

Nevertheless, when reading Dutch you will see the kinship between the languages, even in many short words, common or not. For example compare:

:This week, my father is on the wharf with my brother and his daughter.
:''Deze week is mijn vader op de werf met mijn broer en zijn dochter''.

These sentences consist almost entirely of ''cognates'': words that evolved from the same source. Dutch is indeed one of easiest languages to learn for an Anglophone. Notice however the position of the verb '''is''' in these two phrases. In Dutch it stands in front of the father. This is because Dutch has retained something that English has lost: the rather complicated word order (syntax) of the West-Germanic languages. Many English speakers who learn Dutch find that one of the most difficult aspects to learn to do correctly, but it hardly ever leads to miscommunication. In the course it is introduced bit by bit. The full picture is only described in one of the last lessons (21).

===Dutch and German===
Both Dutch and German are West-Germanic languages and this means that there are many resemblances. However, Dutch is easier to learn for a speaker of English for a number of reasons. First of all, (High-) German underwent a major shift of almost all its consonants in the early Middle Ages. In term of its consonants Dutch has been pretty conservative. Compare:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!English!! Dutch !!  German 
|-
|  wa''t''er ||    wa''t''er ||  Wa'''ss'''er
|- 
| ma''k''e! ||    maa''k''! ||  ma'''ch'''e!
|-
|  ''p''epper ||   ''p''eper||   P'''f'''e'''ff'''er
|}
This makes a major part of Dutch vocabulary easier to memorize. Secondly, German retained its system of case endings in contrast to Dutch and English. It is not easy to master that system if your mother-tongue does not have it.  Compare:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!English!! Dutch !!  German 
|-
|  the old man sees the pretty woman ||   de oude man ziet de mooie vrouw || '''der alte''' Mann sieht '''die hübsche''' Frau
|- 
| the pretty woman sees the old man ||    de mooie vrouw ziet de oude man ||  '''die hübsche''' Frau sieht '''den alten''' Mann
|}

Knowledge of German can certainly help in learning Dutch, but it can also be a source of confusion. A good example is the letter combination '''''sch'''''. In German it denotes the same consonant as '''''sh''''' in English (in IPA: [ʃ]), in Dutch this sound is relatively rare. It only occurs in loans from languages like Frisian, English, French etc. 

{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|schip}} schip||{{knop|chronisch}} chronisch
|}
In Dutch 'sch' usualy denotes [sx]: an [s] followed by a velar spirant [x], like in ''schip''. In the ending -isch the 'ch' is mute and it is pronounced as [-is] as in English 'fleece'.

A topic where knowledge of German is a great help is syntax (word order), but on the other hand there are differences in how the verb tenses are used. In German the imperfect past tense, like ''du gabst, sprachst, rettettest'' is on its way out. In Dutch forms like ''jij gaf, sprak, redde'' are alive and kicking and in every day use.

===Dutch and Scandinavian languages===
Although Danish, Swedish and Norwegian are North-Germanic languages, which means that the relationship is a bit more distant, speakers of these languages typically do not find Dutch very difficult, because many changes in the language such as the loss of the case endings and of feminine gender are quite similar. Some Scandinavians manage to speak Dutch so well without any discernible accent that people don't realize that they are not Dutch. Swedes may have to pay attention to their intonation, because that is rather different in Swedish.

===Dutch and French / Italian and other romance languages ===
For speakers of the Romance languages Dutch is by no means an easy language to learn, although if you already speak English some of the problems may already have been overcome.

Dutch is a stress language like English and German. That is: every word has one syllable that is high in pitch, a bit louder, and usually a bit longer than all the other ones. In French those three qualities are not coupled and spread more evenly over the syllables of the word. In Dutch, stressed syllables have either a full vowel (one of twelve) or a diphthong; the unstressed syllables all tend to have a schwa. Intonation is therefore difficult for Romance speakers because the contrasts between the syllables is much smaller in those languages.

Another problem is formed by the separable verbs. There often is no direct equivalent in French for the fine nuances imparted by the separable prefix in Dutch. Often an entirely different verb needs to be substituted, or there is none available.

French speakers usually have little problem with the vowels, but they do tend to speak much more in the front of the mouth than Dutch speakers do. The placement of the sounds is different. For other Romance languages a vowel like ''u'' [y] or ''eu'' [ø] the ''ui'' [ʌy] diphthong might be problematic, as well as the gutteral spirants ''g'' and ''ch''.

===Dutch and Russian / other Slavic languages===
A main problem for Russian speakers lies in the vowel system of Dutch. The vowels a, e, i, o, u all occur in two different qualities. The differences are difficult to hear and reproduce for Russian speakers. 

Another problem is the voiced consonants like b, v, d, z. In Dutch they all get devoiced at the end of the word, but that hold for Russian too. However, they often also get devoiced when they follow a voiceless consonant, even in assimilation from the previous word. E.g.
:de '''v'''ele autos - [v]
:het '''v'''ee   - [f]

A grammatical problem is that Dutch is a ''tense'' language and Russian an ''aspect'' language. Dutch has perfect tenses, Russian perfective aspects. They cover the same territory, but one lengthwise the other in the other direction.

===Dutch and Mandarin===
Of course the differences are very large and numerous, but one difficulty deserves mention, that of epenthesis. The syllables of Mandarin are either CV or CVn, i.e. they start with a single consonant and end in a vowel or a nasal. In Dutch they can end in other consonants and in fact multiple ones, like ''herfst'' is CVCCCC with no less than four consonants at the end. Mandarin speakers need to suppress the tendency to add epenthetic vowels, making it something like herefesete. Epenthetic (inserted) vowels are sometimes used by Dutch speakers too, e.g. ''werken'' may well be pronounced ''werreke'', but this is considered dialectal and non-standard and is frowned upon by most speakers.

==Vocabulary and Grammar==
In learning to read or speak any new language, two important aspects to be mastered are ''vocabulary'' and ''grammar'' (others are pronunciation and syntax, but they usually do not stop you from being understood). Acquiring vocabulary is a &quot;simple&quot; matter of memorization. 

===Learning by ear===

Children do it all the time, but they are at an advantage: they memorize far easier than grown-ups. Age is a definite disadvantage in language learning. The child's learning process can be &quot;reactivated&quot; to some extent by immersion in a second language: a method of learning a new language by moving to a place where that language is spoken and having to get around and live without use of one's native tongue.

If you do not have the opportunity of residing in a Dutch speaking area an alternative is to listen to recordings and we are in process of adding bits and pieces as .ogg files so that you can learn by ear. Use them as much as you can. More than once. 

These files take different forms
#Single words. They are useful when you are trying to memorize vocabulary
#Spoken text of the chapter. They should be used to study the conversations
#Drills. Here you need to repeat words or utterances in the pauses.
#Translation drills. Here you are told to say something in Dutch yourself.

In the Example lessons there are also links to YouTube videos where the text of a poem is recited or a song is sung.

Of course there is also a drawback to the by-ear method:  You do not get much immersion into reading Dutch.  You as an internet user, will most likely want to be literate in Dutch.

As with all languages: the ''written'' Dutch language and the ''spoken'' Dutch language are by no means identical. At times we will explain the distinction if necessary.

===Learning by eye===

This is why this course also tries to train your eyes, but this will not work without effort from your side. This is why we often say: '''''Your turn!''''' ('''''Uw beurt!''''')

So what do you need to do? There are a variety of things. We are tackling the problem with a multi-pronged approach. 

Be sure to &quot;learn&quot;&amp;mdash;commit to memory&amp;mdash;all of the vocabulary words in each lesson as they are presented. Early lessons have simple sentences because it is assumed that the student's vocabulary is limited. 

To help you accumulate vocabulary there are a number of additional pages see: [[Dutch/Vocabulary]]. They are are mostly both visual and audio in nature and there are exercises to go with them (still being created).

Throughout the text, more complex discourses (e.g. as photo captions) are included to introduce the student to regular Dutch in use. It may be helpful to translate these using a Dutch-English dictionary (Wiktionary is usually on a click or two away). Other sources of Dutch, such as newspapers, magazines, web sites, etc. can also be useful in building vocabulary and developing a sense of how Dutch words are put together. The [http://nl.wikipedia.org/ Dutch Wikipedia] provides an ever expanding source of Dutch language articles that can be used for this purpose. Further, a Dutch version of the English Wikibooks project&amp;mdash;a library of textbooks in Dutch &amp;mdash; is available at [[:nl:Hoofdpagina|Dutch Language Textbooks]] and there is a growing Dutch version of [[:nl:wikt:Hoofdpagina|wiktionary]] (WikiWoordenboek) to which a number of words in the text have been linked for direct reference. WikiWoordenboek usually has an example phrase to go with every dictionary entry to show the word in context. This too is a helpful tool for expanding your vocabulary, as context helps memorization.

===Learning grammar and syntax===

This is where as a grown up you are at an advantage, because you may already know how grammar works from your mother tongue or other languages you are proficient in to some extent.

Dutch grammar is sufficiently similar to English grammar that &quot;reading&quot; Dutch is possible with minimal vocabulary. The student should generally recognize the parts of a sentence. With a good dictionary, a sentence can usually be translated correctly. Of course there are some notable exceptions and ''false friends'', e.g. in the way that the passive voice is formed:

:hij wordt gezien - he '''''is''''' seen
:hij '''''is''''' gezien - he has been seen.

To speak and write Dutch properly you do need to learn its grammar and syntax. Particularly the latter (word order) is rather different. We will gradually introduce it. Do not be daunted by it. Learning a language goes bit by bit, word for word, structure by structure. Just keep at it and look at what you have gained not at what you don't understand. Children don't always understand everything either, but they are not ashamed or humiliated by that.

==Pronunciation==
A guide to pronunciation of Dutch is provided as [[Dutch/Alfabet|Appendix 1]]. You should become familiar with this page early on, and refer to it often. Nothing can replace learning a language from a native speaker, but the text is liberally sprinkled with audio files providing the student with valuable input from hearing spoken Dutch. Analyze the spoken words carefully. Descriptions of the pronunciation as in Appendix 1 can only closely, not exactly, convey how Dutch words should be pronounced. This is why there are quite a few buttons on that page that allow you ''hear'' what is meant. Do compare!

Of course there are variations in pronunciation. Dutch spoken in the country side of Brabant, in the cities of Amsterdam, Antwerpen or  Paramaribo sound pretty different and the same thing can be said for the board room and the back alley. We do present pronunciations from different people and places in the sound files and even more so in the YouTube video links.

==Grammatica 1-1 ~ Grammar versus what children do==
===Why grammar?===
[[File:Toothbrush 20050716 004.jpg|thumb|200px|de {{knp2|tandenborstel}}]]
Children learn their mother tongue without knowing the parts of speech such as verbs, nouns and phrases. However these are helpful for anyone attempting to learn a second language from a book or a website. Of course the children have it right: the ''best'' way to learn a language is to listen to a mother tongue speaker and simply repeat. Then just use the word in a similar situation and see how people react. Children are masters at acquiring language this way and are generally smiled at when they use a word incorrectly. Being an adult, people are often not so forgiving to you and you feel foolish when people laugh and point out to you that you just said &quot;toothbrush&quot;  while you meant &quot;toothpick&quot;. Besides, native speakers may not always be available to you. Or if they are they are not eager to spend time playing 'child' with you. This book will try to compensate this by addition of audio files and visual information, -as the figure to the right- but that is still only a cumbersome substitute. We do recommend that you use them as much as you can. Firefox seems to give easier access to them than other browsers. So, please go ahead, push that arrow and learn to say 'toothbrush' properly. Your first Dutch word? Congrats.

Although clearly children are superior in language acquisition, grown ups do have an advantage: they can analyze language better in terms of its grammar. This course therefore uses both approaches: it will deal with grammar, but it will also ask you to be a child and listen and repeat or look at some pictures while playing a sound clip. Don't be afraid to be a bit childish! It serves a purpose.

One important observation about children should be mentioned: they always learn language ''in a certain context''.

===Is it all just grammar here then?===
'''No!''' There is much more. Audio files are inserted into the main lessons as much as possible, even though they aim at gradually introducing grammar and syntax. The parallel series of practice lessons (1A, 2A etc.) provide additional practice, vocabulary building, sound material and quizzes. The example pages (Vb. 1 etc.) follow the contextual path of learning like children do and involve nursery rhymes, poems, stories, songs and the like. More of the latter two series is still being added as of May 2015. And there are [[Dutch/Vocabulary|audio-visual vocabulary pages]] to help you learn more words.

===What is the best way?===
So, what is the best way to learn a language? The best way is to '''''do something everyday'''''. What you do is often less important than simply doing it. Children are champions in language acquisition and they never worry about what they do. Oh, and what you do, may very well be doing that same exercise again. Children love doing things &quot;again&quot;. Ever watched the Teletubbies? ''Repeating'' is an important key to language acquisition. Being &quot;efficient&quot; and saying: &quot;oh, I have done that before, let me skip that!&quot; is a bad adult habit that children would never stoop to, until they get really bored with something. (Which is when they already know it). So, push that button below the toothbrush again! And tomorrow come back here and do the same.

===Other assets===
Another thing to exploit is the other languages you already know. English speakers will find many strong parallels between their language and Dutch. German speakers even more so, but there are also differences. Where possible we will try to point out the similarities and the differences and exploit them.

However, as noted in the [[Dutch/Introduction|introduction]], Dutch grammar is more complex than English grammar, and identifying the meaning of words in a Dutch sentence is difficult without understanding the clues to word function that come from the grammatical rules. The basic lessons of this textbook are set up to first introduce the parts of speech, and then bring in the rules that govern these. Pay particular attention to sentence word order as you progress through the lessons.

===Some tricks this course uses===
====Hovering====

Some words will be {{C|underlined|this is cribbing of course, but if you don't know a word you may}}. Try to hover your mouse over such words.

====Topics and vocabulary====
There are pages to help you build [[Dutch/Vocabulary|vocabulary]] in a visual / auditive way.

====Audio files====
Whenever you see one of the following:
*[[file:nl-Nederlander.ogg]]
Or:
*{{knop|Vlaming}}

Please click and listen! (If you do not see any buttons now: try a different browser. Firefox and Chrome seem to work. Explorer does not.)&lt;br/&gt;
After listening, pronounce the word the best you can and then click again. Keep doing that till you are satisfied with your own result. It is useful to then leave it be for, say 20 minutes and do it again. Then perhaps once more the next day.

====Vocabulary / Pronunciation boxes====
{|class=&quot;wikitable collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
!colspan=&quot;3&quot;|Vocabulary
|-
|de {{Nlwikt|uitspraak}}||[[file:nl-uitspraak.ogg]]||pronunciation
|-
|de {{Nlwikt|woordenschat}}||[[file:nl-woordenschat.ogg]]||vocabulary
|}
For many texts there is a box on the right that you can open to look at the vocabulary being trained and listen to the pronunciations. Click it to open it and start listening and reading.

===Using other sites===
====Wiktionary====
Throughout the texts and in the vocabulary lists there are blue links that take you to the Dutch version of [http://nl.wiktionary.org/wiki/Hoofdpagina  our sister project Wiktionary]. It is called WikiWoordenboek. Of course the layout is in Dutch and you may not immediately understand everything, but that is not a disaster. If you want to learn a language you also should learn to be a bit of a detective: you often need to get the gist of something with a few pieces of the puzzle missing. Don't let that scare you off! Here are a few useful topics used on WikiWoordenbook:

#There usually is an English translation of a word under the heading '''''Vertalingen''''', marked '''Engels''' 
#There is also a ''geluidsopname'' (sound recording) or a phonetic description under '''''Uitspraak'''''. 
#There are tables, usually to the right giving the various forms of the word, say, the plural or the past tense.
#There are usually example sentences putting the word in context
#There are usually antonyms, synonyms, derivatives or related terms

If you are really lost use the interwiki link to the English version (or any other language you know) as back up, but don't give in to it too easily! Use to to figure out what you did not quite get on the Dutch version.

We encourage you to use the links to expand your vocabulary. First guess what a word means, then click!

Just try it on the verb {{Nlwikt|slapen}}; look at the box with three forms on the right. What is the past tense? (It is the middle one in the box)

====Quizlet and Memrise====
There are plenty other sites that allow you to expand your growing knowledge of Dutch. They all have their pros and cons. For example [http://www.memrise.com/home/ Memrise]]  and [https://quizlet.com/ Quizlet] have an interesting way to boost vocabulary, but teach zero syntax or grammar and usually little other context. But if you want a vocabulary boost it's great and we are in the process of creating practice sets dedicated to the material of the lessons here. Some already have a quizlet link on the bottom of the page. It is therefore recommended to register for '''Quizlet'''. (It is for free).

====YouTube====
YouTube has a plethora of videos, that we will even send you to at times. Again: good for listening, vocabulary building, often less so on grammar and syntax, but plenty of other context.

====But do come back: the context====
There is a pertinent Dutch proverb: ''Verandering van spijs doet eten''  - ''Change of food makes you eat''. Children also vary what they play with. Variety of learning is healthy. Besides children never learn a word outside context. When they learn a new word, it always goes together with the context of:
# the words around it (semantic context), 
# the way they interrelate (the grammatical context), 
# the order in which they are used (the syntactic context), 
# whether convey anger, sweetness, seriousness (the emotional context), 
# in what kind situations it is used: a school squabble, a church service (social context), 
# in which time period they are/were used (temporal context), 
# by what kind of people: punks, managers, construction workers, kings, pimps, doctors (register context). 

One aim of this book is to provide as much of that context as possible. This is why conversations, stories, texts, poems and songs are important: they give context to the words you are learning.

So, enough talk! Let's get started. And we'll start in the context of a simple conversation

==Gesprek 1-1 ~ Vrienden: Jan en Karel==

We will put such text material in a colored box. What you are supposed to do with such material is the following. 
#First click on the arrow button to ''listen'' to the story and try to read along. 
#Then use the hover method to see an instant translation of a certain word and try to piece together the meaning of the story. 
#Then use the ''Vocabulary'' box on the right to concentrate on single words an start memorizing. 
#Once you have an idea of the gist of the story you can open up the drop down box and read the ''translation'' to see if you were right.
#Then click the arrow again and see if you understand what is being said, first while reading along, then with your eyes closed.

When learning a new language it is very important to be able to deduce meaning from limited information, because you will often not know all the words used. Picking up their meaning from context is an important skill. This is why the hovering is important.

You may notice that Dutch sometimes strings words together a bit differently than English. Dutch word order is quite different and a difficult aspect of the language, but we will revisit that many times. So don't worry about it for the moment, just observe.

===Pronunciation===
Dutch pronunciation varies with region and speaker, and you may have been shocked at some of the sounds of the language. You can visit [[Dutch/Alfabet]] if that is the case. Dutch spelling is not really phonetic, but pretty systematic (much more so than English) and once you learn the system you should be able to pronounce an unknown word on sight pretty well.

It is not easy to render the sounds in writing, but the following rendition in IPA gives a reasonable idea. Try running the sound file again while reading the IPA version. 

:{{IPA|'vrin.də(n)}}
:{{IPA|'jɑn.kɔmt.'ka.rəl.ɔp.'stra.'te.ɣə(n) zə.zɛɪn.vrin.də(n)}}
::{{IPA|ɦɔj,'ka.rəl.ɦu.'ɣat.ət.'mɛ.cə}}
::{{IPA|ɦɔj,dɑŋ.k&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ə,mɛt.'mɛɪ.'ɣat.ət.xut.ʔɛn.'mɛ.'cɑʊ}}
::{{IPA|dɑŋ.k&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;ə,mɛt.mɛɪ.'ɣat.ət.'ok.xut. tɔ.'tsins}}
::{{IPA|tɔ.'tsins.jɑn}}

:Notice sounds like {{IPA|[ɣ]}} and {{IPA|[x]}}? And how t+j run together into {{IPA|[c]}}? And how about {{IPA|[ɦ]}}? Or the vowel {{IPA|[u]}}? 
:Notice also that vowels often occur in two varieties: {{IPA|a/ɑ, e/ɛ, o/ɔ}}. They are often called 'long' and 'short', but those names are misleading: they are really different sounding vowels.&lt;ref&gt;This is particularly a point of difficulty for speakers of Slavic languages like Russian or Czech.&lt;/ref&gt; The length difference is rather secondary, if there is any.

If you prefer other renditions than IPA try [[Dutch/Gesprek 1-1|this page]]

==Grammatica 1-2 ~ Forms==
We will use the material in the colored boxes to point at grammatical phenomena and introduce the grammar that way, step by step. 
===Clitic forms===
{|style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|{{knop|jou}} jou||{{knop|je}} je
|}
Did you notice the difference between &quot;Hoe gaat het '''met ''je'''''&quot;? and &quot;En '''met ''jou'''''?&quot; in the conversation?  Both translate literally into '''with ''you''''', but there is a difference in emphasis. ''Jou'' carries emphasis, ''je'' does not. In Dutch, there are often two forms of the same pronoun: a strong one and a weak ('clitic'&lt;ref&gt;There are other languages that show similar differences. Gaelic e.g. has ''tu'' and ''tusa''. French also has the difference between ''tu'' and ''toi'' but the usuage is a bit different than in Dutch.&lt;/ref&gt;) one. This is particularly true in spoken, colloquial Dutch. In the written language the clitic ones are not always shown as such. 

*The full forms have full vowels or diphthongs (like in j'''ou''') and can either carry stress or not.
*The clitic forms cannot have emphasis and the vowel in a clitic is often reduced to a neutral 'schwa' [ə] (like in j''e''') or omitted entirely. 

In colloquial English the same thing can be heard at times: ''seeya!'' instead of ''see you!''. In Dutch the use of clitics is very common; it already was in the Middle Dutch period before 1500.

For now remember: '''never stress a clitic'''

===Polite forms===
The above conversation was between two good friends. It utilizes the '''familiar''' form of the personal pronoun (''je'', ''jou'') where English uses ''you''. However, Dutch also has a '''polite''' or formal form of the personal pronoun for the second person (you), '''[[wikt:u#Dutch|u]]'''. Many languages have this distinction. It is e.g. comparable with  {{Nlwikt|sibh}} in Gàidhlig, [[wikt:Sie|Sie]] in German,  [[wikt:vous|vous]] in French, [[wikt:usted|usted]] in Spanish, [[wikt:Вы|Вы]] in Russian, or [[wikt:anata|anata]] in Japanese. When to use one or the other is not always easy to decide. Someone unknown, particularly if older, is generally ''u'', an old friend typically ''je, jou''. The latter roughly corresponds with the 'first name basis' in English.  Notice the use of ''u'' in the conversation below that takes place between colleagues rather than close friends. They would never say: &quot;hoi!&quot; to each other.

===Regional forms===

In the South of the area where Dutch is spoken (Flanders mostly), people do not distinguish between familiar and polite forms, instead they still use an older pronoun ''gij'' (clitic: ''ge'', object: ''u''). In the north it has become obsolete since about 1800. It is used much like ''you'' in English for both singular and plural. In the North ''gij'' is now only encountered there in archaic phrases like: ''gij zult niet stelen'' - ''thou shalt not steal''. Like ''thou'' the pronoun ''gij'' takes its own verb forms. This course is mostly based on northern usage as this is the most widely accepted, including in Suriname and the Antilles, but some important differences will be pointed out and we will see ''gij'' occasionally when we look at some older poetry.

==Grammatica 1-3 ~ Introduction to pronouns==


A '''[[Wikipedia:Pronoun|pronoun]]''' is a short word that takes the place of a noun previously mentioned in the sentence, paragraph, or conversation. 

'''''Recall''''': Kent u ''meneer Standish''? Bent u ''hem'' al tegengekomen?

''Hem'' refers back to ''meneer Standish''. It is a ''pronoun'' that stands ''for'' (pro- !) meneer Standish.

There is a variety of pronouns like personal, possessive, relative and indefinite ones. Let's look at the personal pronouns first.

===Personal pronouns===

Both English and Dutch have had a system of case endings in the past, as languages like German and Russian still do today. In English most of the system fell into disuse after the Norman invasion in 1066. The collapse of the system in spoken Dutch dates mostly from the 16th century and in the written language it was scrapped as recently as 1947. That means that Dutch has more remnants of the case system left than English and we will even devote [[Dutch/Lesson 15|lesson 15]] to those remnants. The personal pronouns actually still show some case differences in both languages.

Personal pronouns are quite familiar in English: They are words like I,you,he,she,we,you and they. &lt;br&gt;At least this is the case for the subject (nominative '''''case'''''). As object (accusative) some of them are different: ''me'',you,''him'',''us'',you,''them''. Compare:

::&lt;font color=blue&gt;I&lt;/font&gt; see you.
::You see &lt;font color=blue&gt;me&lt;/font&gt;.

Notice how '''I''' turns into '''me''' when used as an object. '''You''' remains the same.

Much like in English, '''ik''' (subject) turns into '''mij''' as object in Dutch, whereas '''je''' remains the same in both roles:

::&lt;font color=blue&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt; zie je.
::Je ziet &lt;font color=blue&gt;mij&lt;/font&gt;.

The system in Dutch resembles the English one quite a bit, after all the languages are close relatives:

*As in English there are three '''''persons''''' in Dutch grammar: first (I), second (you) and third (he) 
*As in English there is a distinction in '''''number''''' between singular (I) and plural (we). 
*As in English there are '''''gender''''' distinctions in the third person singular (he, she, it) 
*As in English there are '''''case''''' distinctions between subject and object (he, him)

Nevertheless the Dutch system is a little more involved, as we have seen there are:

*familiar and polite forms: ''je'' versus ''u''. 
*weak (clitics) and strong forms: ''je'' versus ''jou''.

In addition there are
# Regional differences:  (jij/jullie  - u) (North) versus (gij) (South) 
# A growing rift between how inanimate and animate nouns are treated
#:In English ''he'' and ''she'' are reserved for ''animate'' nouns -usually persons- and this is increasingly the case in Dutch as well, certainly in Northern usage. We will revisit this point later.
# Pronominal replacement: the combination preposition + pronoun (e.g. with it) is usually replaced by an adverb
#:We will revisit that in lesson 8

Let's leave most of these complications aside for the moment and concentrate on the forms of the pronouns. There are a few more than in English.

====Remarks====

# As you see not all pronouns have clitics and some of them (shown in parentheses) are not often used in the written language.
# *In prescriptive grammar ''hun'' is dative and hen is ''accusative''. But in speaking, Dutch speakers generally do not make this distinction. This is because the ''hen'' form was artificially created by the grammarians of the past &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Dutch&quot; by Jan G. Kooij in ''The world's major languages'' edt. Bernard Comrie ISBN 0-19-520521-9 Oxford University Press 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and in the whole rest of the language there are no other words that make a distinction between dative and accusative. In the spoken language ''hen'' and ''hun'' are often used interchangeably (as synonyms) or people avoid the issue by opting for the clitic ''ze''.

==Exercises 1-1==
===Quizlet===
This is the point where it is '''your turn''' to put in some effort yourself, because obviously you have some memorization to do.

There is a [https://quizlet.com/85109848/dutch-personal-pronouns-wikibook-lesson-1-flash-cards/ '''Quizlet practice set'''] (27 terms) to help you with memorizing the pronouns. But it is recommended to ''first'' use the above tables. Unfortunately, the pronunciation of some of the clitics with apostrophes is wrong at Quizlet.  So click the arrow buttons here to listen to the pronunciation and speak it out loud yourself until you feel confident that you know them, then go to Quizlet. Do make sure you can hear sound at Quizlet.&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes you need to restart your browser to make it work.&lt;/ref&gt;First scan through the cue cards, then do some of the other methods available. It should take you an hour or so and you will know some of the most frequently used words in the language.

:Are there any cases where the case is different from what the English translation has? Why?
|
Jan komt Karel op straat tegen. '''Ze''' zijn vrienden. 
:::(3rd person plural nominative weak)
:''Jan'': Goedendag, Karel.  Hoe gaat het met '''je'''? 
:::(2nd person singular accusative weak)
:''Karel'': Goedendag. Dank je, met '''mij''' gaat het goed. En met '''jou'''?
:::(1st person singular accusative strong / 2nd person singular accusative strong)
:''Jan'': Dank '''je''', met '''mij''' gaat het goed. Tot ziens.
:::(2nd person singular accusative weak / 1st person singular accusative strong)
:''Karel'': Tot ziens, Jan!

In the expression ''hoe gaat het met jou'', ''jou'' is in the object case, because it follows a preposition ''met'' (with). Literally it says ''how goes it with you''. English would say: How are you? In that case ''you'' is subject, not object.

:Meneer Jansen komt mevrouw De Vries tegen. '''Het''' zijn handelaars. 
:::(3rd person singular nominative neuter) Note that Dutch often uses 'it are' to indicate generality.
::''Meneer Jansen'': Goedendag, mevrouw De Vries!
::'Mevrouw De Vries'': Goedendag, meneer Jansen!
::''Meneer Jansen'': Hoe gaat het met '''u'''? 
:::(2nd person singular accusative polite)
::''Mevrouw De Vries'': Zeer goed, bedankt. En met '''u'''? 
:::(same)
::''Meneer Jansen'': Ook goed.
::''Mevrouw De Vries'': Mooi. Bent '''u''' meneer Standish al tegengekomen? 
:::(2nd person singular nominative polite)
::''Meneer Jansen'': Uit Engeland? Nee. Is '''hij''' op bezoek?
:::(3rd person singular nominative)
::''Mevrouw De Vries'': Ja. Tot ziens, meneer Jansen!
::''Meneer Jansen'': Tot ziens, mevrouw De Vries

{{Dutch/Exercise|Turn into clitics
|
Turn the personal pronouns into their clitic forms if possible:

:Jij komt hen tegen.
:Zegt hij goedendag of hoi?
:Zij is ook op bezoek
:Jullie zijn goede vrienden
:Gij zijt uit Engeland
:Gaat het goed met jou?
:Zij groeten mij met &quot;hoi&quot;.
:Het gaat goed met ons
:U spreekt Nederlands met hen
:Wij spreken Engels
|
:J'''e''' komt '''ze''' tegen.
:Zegt-'''ie''' goedendag of hoi?
:'''Ze''' is ook op bezoek
:Jullie zijn goede vrienden '''no change'''
:'''Ge''' zijt uit Engeland
:Gaat het goed met '''je'''?
:'''Ze''' groeten '''me''' met &quot;hoi&quot;.
:''''t''' Gaat goed met ons
:U spreekt Nederlands met '''ze'''
:'''We''' spreken Engels

Notice though that you have shifted the emphasis of each sentence by doing this replacement. E.g. in &quot;wij spreken Engels&quot; the emphasis is mostly on ''we'' (not: you or them), in &quot;we spreken Engels&quot; it is mostly on English (not: e.g. Dutch)

===Quizlet===
The vocabulary of this lesson can be trained at [https://quizlet.com/85125945/dutch-wikibook-vocabulary-lesson-1-flash-cards/ Quizlet]. (33 terms)

===Your turn! Building vocabulary 1===

When learning a language you need to start building up your vocabulary. There are various ways of doing that. One is to study the above conversations well. Often words are easier to remember when put in context. We will add vocabulary building exercises to each lesson to make it easier for you to memorize it all.

{{Dutch/Exercise|vocabulary

Go to [[Dutch/Vocabulary/Personal pronouns/hover test]] to check your knowledge of Dutch personal pronouns.&lt;br&gt;
Go to [[Dutch/Vocabulary/Lesson 1/hover test]] to check your knowledge of the above vocabulary.
|
}}
{{Dutch/Exercise|Additional vocabulary|
 
Go to the [[Dutch/Vocabulary/Survival kit]] to learn the 56 most important words in the Dutch language. The same set has been created at [https://quizlet.com/84964137/survival-kit-of-56-most-common-dutch-words-flash-cards/ Quizlet] if you prefer to use their methods. Once you know them all, try to translate the following:
#Wil jij misschien een vrouw?
#Dit is erg slecht, denk ik.
#Na het leven is er de dood
#Ik hoor hier mensen beneden 
#Er is een tijd en een plaats voor alle dingen
#Goed en slecht, klein en groot, kort en lang zijn niet dezelfde dingen
#Zet een klein deel voor, een ander deel achter , iets meer boven en de rest beneden
|

#Do you want a woman perhaps?
#That is very bad, I think
#After life there is death
#I hear people down here
#There is a time and a place for all things
#Good and bad, small and big, short and long are not the same things
#Put a small part in front, another part behind, a bit more on top and the rest below.
}}

==Progress made==
If you have studied the above well, you should
#Know more about the process of language acquisition. This should allow you to tailor your own learning better to your specific needs and preferences
#Started tuning your ears and your mouth to the pronunciation
#Gained vocabulary: 27 pronouns, 33 terms introduced in the lesson, 56 of the most often used words in the language, '''116''' terms in total.
#Learned about the use of personal pronouns, including their clitic, polite and regional forms.

==Further practice==
This lesson is accompanied by two pages that are intended to practice and reinforce what you have learned above. They do that with a bit different approach

* [[Dutch/Lesson 1A|Les 1A]] will give you more conversations and practice.
* [[Dutch/Example 1|Voorbeeld 1]] uses the simplest pieces of literature: nursery rhymes to teach language in a playful and amusing way.

It is recommended that you first work on the material in these two modules before you move on to lesson two, but of course this depends on your level of understanding and one of the nice things about the wiki-system is that one can use it whichever way you see fit. (Which is what children would do, but they are used to running into new things that they do not fully comprehend.)

Isn't [[Dutch: Introduction|Dutch]] easier for English speakers? It's definitely closer. The problem with Dutch is however that its speakers tend to speak English quite well - and they like to do it. It can be hard to reach a sufficiently high level to be responded in Dutch, and thus to really learn the language by talking and listening to people. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 23:27, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)

===Vocabulary===

Our vocabulary is very spread out, based on whatever anyone felt like sticking in the example texts. This is a problem, because if someone wanted to look up a word, they would have to search through every lesson. Of course, we are not a German-English dictionary, but I believe we should definitely group our vocabulary lessons by topic, such as food, sports, furniture, school supplies, school subjects, weather, tasks, or math, either in an appendix or in the lessons and advanced lessons themselves.

We also should make an attempt to teach more than just grammar in the opening lessons. Outside viewers will not want to see only hardcore grammar as they learn German. They also need practical applications for the grammar we give. We could, for example, teach months and days of the week along with the ordinal and cardinal numbers in [[German: Lesson 3|Lesson 3]]. Then, we could include more stuff such as the translations for yesterday, tomorrow, or how to say, &quot;My birthday is...&quot;, &quot;When is...?&quot; and give them numerous examples. This kind of change would do three things for us:
# Provide some practical applications in conjunction with the example sentences.
# Allow us to put more useful vocabulary in the right spots and organize it.
# Beef up our lessons to a satisfactory size. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 16:11, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: I have attempted to have themes for each lessons, but it has sometimes gone astray as a result of moving stuff around so much; but it is a good idea and can certainly be contributed to much more. I would not change too much more in the first five Basic lessons as they seem pretty full in most cases already (except your idea of adding a few more &quot;practical&quot; example sentences seems like a valuable one). This idea is especially one that can enhance the Advanced lessons (for an example see [[German: Lesson 3A|Grammatik 3-6]] where more details of telling time are intended). Perhaps if, in lessons yet to be developed, a topic vocabulary were develped first&amp;mdash;see [[German: Lesson_7|Lektion 7]], where someone added both higher numbers/math and colors as &quot;vocabulary themes&quot; and I have been editing within those topics). If the vocabulary were worked out first, the rest of the lesson ideas could be adapted arouind the theme.
:The idea of having (in the conversations and stories) a businessman (Herr Standish), younger student (Karl and Heinrich), and college students (Markus, Helena, and Katrin) was for continuity and to allow themes to develop as you suggest.  For example, the businessman is English and travelling around German-speaking Europe. Thus allowing for developing &quot;travel&quot; or &quot;tourist&quot; themes.
:As for looking up words; the vocabulary is not intended for that purpose and an appendix would be best suited for that.  I've toyed with the idea of having a dictionary of just the words we use in the lessons within a German-English English-German dictionary as an appendix, but that would be a lot of work?  
:My idea in the first lessons is to get the very basics of grammar laid out. When I took German many times many years ago, it was painfully obvious to me that my lack of understanding of &lt;u&gt;English grammar&lt;/u&gt; was hurting my ability to learn German.  Later I was placed in a language emersion situation for another language: Gilbertese (I-Kiribati). Again, until I got a good grammar book on that language, I could not learn it despite being daily surrounded by native speakers. While I agree with your sugestions, the heavy grammar stuff in the beginning is really important for English speakers to understand before they can begin to learn German. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:43, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Finally, we should make learning vocabulary more than just a list at the end of the page. We should include more than is just in the example sentences, or, better yet, put the vocabulary ''in the middle'' of the lesson. This would give our readers a break from grammar and at the same time make them actually learn it, not just look to it as a reference. People will skip it and think it an afterthought if it's left to the end of a lesson. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 16:11, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:We can certainly try to move the vocabulary from the last thing on a page.  I disagree students will think it an afterthought, since most lessons start with a story or conversation that requires the student to constantly refer to the Vokabeln to read. But there is no reason we cannot have more than one Vokabeln per page.  Say one that follows the story or conversation with just those newly introduced words, then another at the end or at least further in to pick up any new words encountered as the student moves through the lesson.
:Nice to see you are taking some ownership here. We have lots of lessons to go, so there is plenty of opportunity to steer things in the directions you are suggesting. The first 5 Basic lessons, while not &quot;done&quot;, are getting near to completion&amp;mdash;the Advanced lessons for each still need lots of work. Also, when you have time, add something on the [[German: Contributors]] page about yourself.  - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:43, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I split the Vokabeln in [[German:_Lesson 1|Lektion 1]] as you suggested, and I do like it better that way. The vocabulary is smaller and more accessible to the task that way, rather than having the whole thing at the end - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:38, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)
----
Some lessons, such as [[German: Lesson 4|Lesson 4-1]] are, in my opinion, ''horrible'' for the opening topic on any page this early. If this is a textbook for beginners, why is the whole introduction and conversation in German? I'm sure students would get frustrated with having to check the vocabulary, but they also need a more basic conversation and a slow, formalized introduction to words, word order, and certain topics.
:Lesson 4 is still a little rough. For example, the conversation section is yet to be developed. However, I disagree it is &quot;horrible&quot;. It has grammar lessons that are very much related concepts: it introduces adjectives, then covers the possessive adjectives, combining the previous lessons' on case by linking adjectives, possessives (especially possessive pronouns), and the genitive case&amp;mdash;therefore completing the four lessons on case as applied to pronouns and nouns. It includes indefinite articles because these have yet to be introduced (definite articles are introduced in Lesson 3); This grammar lesson then lays the groundwork for ''ein''-word endings (must follow intro. to adjectives). The last lesson on personal pronoun gender could be moved up anywhere (even up to Lesson 1). This is about the right place to introduce adjectives, but the other concepts could be delayed for a few lessons. Anyway, until a &quot;theme&quot; is developed, each of the grammar lessons here can stay or be moved where they appear to fit in logically. The theme here was to be (but need not be) that Markus is selling some personal stuff at a flea market.  But feel free to change that theme. Below you list themes, which are a good idea.  However, I am trying to weave the characters together, so it would be nice to stick with that &quot;theme&quot; as well - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:28, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::I did not mean that the whole lesson 4 was bad. I meant that the idea of a flea market, selling items, describing that, etc. introduces too many open ends in our work. We would probably have to introduce a whole bunch of new vocabulary. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:52, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::By all means scrap the whole Flea Market idea! It is far to little developed to be worth keeping if you have something better in mind. I was trying to come up with something that would have lots of adjectives (and possessive adjectives) to push that part of the lesson. I'm sure you can do better. Maybe expand on Katrin's refrigerator; was empty, now contains....  - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 19:51, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::::A family intro (or in-depth lesson) could go well there. It would have a lot of possessives (meinem Vater, seine Kusine, etc.) and we could even have the student describe their family members (either physically or their characteristics (freudlich, faul). This would make for an interesting lesson. But I'm not so sure how to introduce it all in a story. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:15, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::::I can get it started if you want, then you can move the story along. Give me a day or so. I had to go to Maui today on business, and my car had problems when I got back and left the airport - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:57, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC) 
----
:The introductory conversations and stories are in German to &lt;u&gt;force&lt;/u&gt; the student to face the real world of language learning.  If everything were simultaneously translated for him/her no learning would take place.  Each lesson should contain lots of sentence/word examples with English alongside to satisfy what you are suggesting.  But being forced to read German and &quot;look up&quot; each word that is not understood progresses the student towards reading German on his/her own. I think the lessons do have &quot;a slow, formalized introduction to words, word order, and certain topics.&quot; Not every lesson is perfect or complete in this regard, but what you describe is what is in there. Indeed, if you look carefully, the lessons introduce grammar concepts one at a time and develop these only up to a point.  More detail is provided in the Advanced lesson, and each grammar lesson will likely reappear later for more complex treatment - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:40, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::My vision of vocabulary is that it would help the student form &lt;u&gt;their own&lt;/u&gt; sentences. It is '''not''' to force the student to simply look something up, instead for them to make their own observations about the surround. To fully understand something is to apply it correctly in new places. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:52, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::That is a good point, and I can see how having a theme could enhance that approach. What about this idea: Within a lesson such as the clothing one (would work anywhere really), have a numbered list of English sentences. Instruct the student to put these into German. Have another &quot;answer&quot; page, where the student can go to compare his sentences with correct ones.  I agree, it is important to have the student do more than translate German to English. Learning to speak (as opposed to read) German is going to require another approach on top of what I presently have; another structural subsection - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 19:51, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)  

Below is somewhat of a sign-up like the one above for the vocabulary and application topics. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 22:28, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;Topics to be discussed&lt;/big&gt;

* 1. Clothing
* 2. School supplies
* 3. School subjects
* 4. Tasks/Jobs
* 5. Gifts
* 6. Food (several lessons could cover this)
* 7. Invitations: Accepting/declining
* 8. Team Sports
* 9. Field Events (track)
* 10. Appropriate &quot;Wie geht's&quot; responses
* 11. Weather
* 12. Movies
* 13. Places to go
* 14. Making plans
* 15. Family members
* 16. Directions, how to get places
* 17. Furniture
* 18. 
* 19. 
* 20. 

:While I agree that having pages or lessons on themes are nice (the following are already themed: Lesson 1, Lesson 2, Lesson 3, Lesson 5, and Lesson 7) the idea that a student will somehow greatly benefit from having all the words about a particular subject (like shopping) is over-rated.  Themes help build interest, but language learners do not necessarily group new words according to any of our ideas about themes. I think numbers, colors, foods, sports might be naturals, but movies, making plans, gifts are just among interesting things that could be discussed and around which grammar lessons could be developed.  Indeed, for these latter, any lessons could be applied and examples drawn from the story or conversation used to set the theme.

:Your examples below are subjects to be covered, and really not in any special to the themes you list above, with a few exceptions (for example, numbers - see Lessons 3 and 7) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:28, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
       
&lt;big&gt;Grammar topic that would go well with&lt;/big&gt;

* 4. Müssen, Helfen verbs
* 5. Dative case
* 6. Essen (obviously), bekommen, other verbs
* 7. einladen, seperable verbs
* 8. spielen, could be used near beginning as an intro
* 9. 
* 10. Phrases as in [[German: Appendix 2]]
* 11. Enough to be its own Lesson
* 12. mögen, paired with next one

:I'm totally unclear on how you would handle some of these lessons. Above you suggest things are too complicated (for which I suggest, we could spread the introductory grammar lessons out over more lessons), then you suggest a whole lesson of just certain verb types. Not that what you suggest are at all bad ideas, but No. 4 for example would need to follow after introduction to verbs as a part of speech (now in Lesson 2), and basic verb conjugation (now in Lesson 5).  Math topics (your No. 2; and now in Lesson 7) would have to follow simple counting (now in Lesson 3). Am I missing the point you are making? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:48, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)  
::OK, first, the lessons I present here are not in order (just making sure). I think the stages of learning grammar '''need''' to be spread out, and very spread out. We should not be teaching the genitive case this early. Even the dative case could wait awhile; we could get the students familiar with phrases such as &quot;mit dem Auto&quot; without actually introducing them to the dative case. I actually think that we should introduce the accusative case in Lesson 3 or 4, which is where I would put the clothing lesson. Lessons on sports, &quot;Wie geht's&quot;, and an easy intro to food could fill the gap. For how I would do this, see [[German:Topical Lesson Layout|the layout]] and my first topical lesson. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 13:51, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::I agree with you. I have been spreading things out more each time I go back in and tweak the lessons. I was already contemplating splitting the dative off to at least one lesson later than the accusative (which has now moved back to lesson 4) and was thinking of moving the genitive well back into the text (certainly after 5).  I do think it is important from the grammar approach to at least mention that these cases exist and must (eventually) be dealt with. But I have no problem with continuing to &quot;spread the difficulty&quot;.  I think I have more to say on this idea somewhere else where you ask about the target audience - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:57, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I just started to create [[German:Topical Lesson Layout|topical lessons]], lessons geared at teaching a certain concept in depth and connecting with grammatical concepts. Eventually, these lessons should be incorporated in the original plan. For an example, see my clothing topical page (Topical Lesson 1) - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:37, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:My comments are on the discussion page for the &quot;topical&quot; lesson, which I have moved over as [[German: Lesson 9|Lektion 9]]  - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:28, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)
-----
What is our target age group? Are we aiming to teach adults the language or junior high and high school students? If we are aiming for adults, they wouldn't mind the heavy grammar stuff as much, partly because they would already have a firm grasp on English grammar. We could probably go along with what we have. If we are aiming at grade school kids, we should probably go more of the topical route. I suggest even splitting the whole site up between these two. Could we do that? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:06, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:I think the target for the basic lesson level is highschool and adults wanting to self teach themselves German.  I think the Advanced level target is college first year. Your idea of developing another track is a real good one.  I was looking at the [[Spanish]] book yersterday and noted that they have two approaches: one more grammar one more conversational; and they ask the user to simply choose the lesson style preferred.  I think that approach can only enhance the usefulness of the book.  Is that what you have in mind as a more &quot;topical&quot; approach? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 06:06, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::Yes, precisely. However, I don't completely agree with the idea of the advanced lessons targeted at a different age group. In the Vorwort, you have one path that goes 1, 1A, 2, 2A, etc. and don't state that this is for a different age level. But you are getting my point. I think we could and should definitely split it up. But how would we word it? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:06, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::Age is not exactly the difference, but more is expected out of a college beginners course than a highschool beginners course. Now you are suggesting a third track&amp;mdash;one that is perhaps closer to highschool or younger beginning German; although again it isd more a matter of ease/difficulty comprehending rather than age.  I assume your idea is to start and develop a more &quot;conversational&quot; approach - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:03, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::::I'm not suggesting a third track. We would have two tracks: one younger (high school or younger), &quot;conversational&quot; and longer, slower approach, and a second grammatical, more college and adult-based approach. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:52, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::::That is a third track since the grammatical approach has two levels that I would like to preserve.  The younger version really cannot interconnnect in the same way as the Basic and Advanced levels now present are intended to interconnect. For one thing, it would be very difficult to make those interconnections because of the &quot;slower&quot; development of the conversational lessons (the latter could utilize the same appendices, but perhaps that is about all). Why not develop your very first lesson and we can see how it goes. It can be &quot;officially&quot; named and moved into sequence once I get the contents page links figured out. We may want a separate TOC to minimize student confusion. I'm interested in seeing how you plan to layout the complete lesson first. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 19:11, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)     
::::::I did not call the &quot;advanced lessons&quot; a seperate track because they cannot stand on their own. You cannot learn through them alone. I do not intend to split that, but rather to create a second 'stand-alone' track. I'm working on my lesson one at [[German:Beginner's Lesson 1]]. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:31, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::::You are right about that, but the &quot;two&quot; tracks existing are (Basic) 1-2-3-4-etc. and (Advanced) 1-1A-2-2A-3-3A-etc. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 08:29, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)

If we were to split it up, this is the order that I would put the topical lessons in:

# Phrases such as &quot;Wie geht's&quot; and hellos/goodbyes along with the nominitive pronouns.
# A sports and activities lesson, introducing the verb haben and ''gern''.
# The first food lesson. Introduces the verbs essen, trinken and bekommen.
# A clothing lesson as in the topical lessson.
# Another food lesson, this time with für and using the accusative case in the previous chapter.
# A short family member lesson with possessives.
# Shopping for school supplies. Introduces kein-words. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:52, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Should we give this new approach another book title (subtitle)? I can probably work up some verbage for the Vorvort that will allow the user to understand that there are differrent levels available (with somewhat different approaches). Should we borrow parts of lessons back and forth between the &quot;books&quot;? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 06:06, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:Yes, this is exactly what I mean. We would have a adult path, somewhat what we have, and an easier, slower (and therefore longer) junior high and high school student path. We could name it with &quot;Beginner's German&quot; or &quot;Easy German&quot;, but I'm sure you could come up with something better. I don't have any particular ideas on the name. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:06, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

----

Can each level have its own Intro? I believe many things are different. Besides, we need to update the Layout section, which is different in all three lessons. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 22:15, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I agree, the intro needs work to make sense for all three levels.  For now, I would prefer one such article for all three levels and I do intend to fix the existing one so it makes sense. But having said that, you still could write a &quot;Forward&quot; that is unique for Level I, and we can figure out a way to integrate the Forward and the Introduction in a useful manner. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:10, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::I'll start that at [[German:Level I Preface]]. &quot;Forward&quot; sounds like an outsider is commenting on the book; &quot;preface&quot; is typically written by the author(s).

:::Looks good to me. Is distinct for Level I, and gives a good introduction to some unique (for English speakers) things about German.

----

I reverted because this is an introduction to the book, not a lesson. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:41, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

You wrote: &gt;&gt;&gt; Hast du Käse? - No one ever says &quot;Have you cheese?&quot; in casual talk &lt;&lt;&lt;

..... By the way, I knew a man who had a redensart=he kept saying often, &quot;Das ist doch Käse!&quot;, meaning that's nonsense. But I suppose not many people say that. [LAUGHS]

QUITTNER, 31 May 2005

&quot;Das ist doch Käse!&quot; means ''That's not good! It isn't worked our very well!'' [[:m:User:Louisana]]

== Ogg-files ==

I don't know if my english pronunciation is that good (can't judge myself) It would be possible to let a native speaker record the englisch words and put them together w/ my german. [[:m:User:Louisana]]
:My Windows Professional and Windows Media Player do not recognize those files as anything. I will need to track down a &quot;player&quot; program before I can listen to them. I recently reinstalled Windows and lost many such programs I had on the computer.  If your second part is a question, I do not know the answer. Certainly with the right software, what you suggest is possible. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:02, 15 August 2005 (UTC)
I know that .ogg files are not the best format and don't run everywhere, but wikimedia likes more ogg files, because they are free - like GNU-FDL. My second sentence wasn't a question, it was a suggestion, they we '''could''' do it, if you think that my english pronunciation is too bad. [[:m:User:Louisana]]
:Well, when I have a little more tme I can look into doing what you suggest (like add my &quot;English&quot;). Right now I can not even hear the files you created (although a few months ago I had that capability on my computer). So I need to track down the software to play (and then to actually create and mix) ogg files. But I do like the suggestion.  - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:08, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
I'm able to play with winamp version 2.91 --[[:m:User:Louisana]]

== Reading List ==

It would be very helpful to include a list of books, or magazines that people could read at each level.  Childrens books and first, and building with the language to other more complex novels.  For example, a recommendation about when someone would be well served to attempt to read harry potter, compared to Wirtschaftswoche.  Are there any good German childrens stories already in the public domain, like Grimm etc.?

== Linking to a help manual for playing ogg files ==

I'm not sure is against typical WikiBooks practice or not, but I feel that it would be appropriate to link to or mention how to play ogg files somewhere in the introduction.  I don't feel that it would be out of place because the intro also covers the layout of this WikiBook.  This is such a great resource and I wouldn't want users to get discouraged because they don't have the appropriate codec installed.  While [[Help:Contents]] has a link to an external site, people may not even think to look there.  I'd even be happy to even see &quot;Visit [[Help:Contents]] if you are having trouble playing the sound files&quot; or something to that effect. Thanks and keep up the good work! --[[User:PS2pcGAMER|PS2pcGAMER]] 10:17, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== Number of Levels? ==

After explaining the difference between '''Level I''' through '''Level V''', the text goes on to state that the section '''German Grammar''' is
: ''... useful to the student working through any of the three levels''
Which three levels out of five is that supposed to be ... only the upper three (i.e., not Levels I or II) or is it just an artifact of a time when there were only three levels instead of the present five? -- [[User:Eliyahu|Eliyahu]] ([[User talk:Eliyahu|talk]]) 09:36, 17 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''Pesto'''  is a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] that originates in the city of Genoa in the Liguria region of northern Italy (''pesto alla genovese''). It can be used as a sauce for pasta or meat, or can be used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. One classic use is to spread the pesto onto slices of bread before toasting. The word &quot;pesto&quot; derives from the Italian for pestle, ''pestello''.

This recipe substitutes [[Cookbook:Romano Cheese|Romano cheese]] for the usual [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]].

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Pesto Ingredients.jpeg|thumb|right|190px]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (100[[Cookbook:g|g]]) fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
*approx. 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (200[[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] freshly grated [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino Romano]] or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or a 1:1 mixture.
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] (optional)
*4 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*Freshly ground [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] (to taste)

==Procedure==
Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|425 °F (220 °C)]]. If using, [[Cookbook:Roasting_nuts|Toast]] the pine nuts in an ovenproof pan for 10&amp;ndash;15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes to prevent excessive browning or burning.  In a small frying pan (skillet), heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil on medium heat.  Crush the garlic and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] in the oil until soft, about 2&amp;ndash;3 minutes.  Combine the basil, garlic, cheese, pine nuts and oil in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]] until it forms a smooth paste, or use a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] or [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] and chop finely, slowly adding the oil to reach the paste-like consistency.

The sauce can be used immediately, when covered with a thin layer of olive oil and refrigerated in an airtight container for one week, or when frozen for several months. The cheese can be omitted to allow longer storage, as it is the most likely ingredient to spoil. Grated cheese can then be added before use.

It's possible to store pesto in jars for longer periods, but it's advisable to add a little extra olive oil on top of the filled jar, otherwise the top of your pesto will turn brown as it oxidizes in the air.

==Notes, tips and variations==
[[Image:Fresh Pesto.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The finished pesto]]
* Traditionally, a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]] is used to make the sauce. The crushing action of the mortar and pestle produces a more intense flavor than the chopping action of a food processor. When using a food processor, you can simulate the additional flavor given by the mortar and pestle method by placing the basil leaves in a plastic bag and crushing them with a rubber mallet or rolling pin prior to use.
* Good quality [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] may replace the Pecorino for a milder taste. Crumbled feta cheese also works well for a different taste.
* A common change to the recipe is to replace some or all of the pine nuts with sunflower seeds, [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]], [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachios]], or [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]].  This significantly reduces the cost of the sauce.  Besides being cheaper, it is also necessary for people with nut allergies.
* For a creamy sauce, take two tablespoons of the pesto in a pan and heat on medium-low. Add one cup light [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] and bring to a simmer. Use for pasta. Serves two.
* The pine nuts can be replaced with an equal quantity of sun-dried [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]].
* You may change the taste by changing the base of the pesto from basil to other easily obtained herbs/vegetables. Some variations include using [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander, for a more aromatic taste) or [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] (more &quot;bang for your buck&quot;, as spinach is much cheaper than basil, yet still has its own distinct flavor).
* Try to mix up the standard basil/garlic combo by introducing shallots (sweet onions) into the mix, as they add a slight sweet taste to the paste.
* Mix fresh chives, marjoram, and thyme with the basil to produce something akin to Valdostano-style pesto.
* Another variant replaces the basil with equal parts of leaf parsley and spring onions. [[Cookbook:Arugula|Arugula]] may also be substituted for basil with surprising, spicy results.
* For another variation of a creamy sauce, add [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] to the recipe.
* A vegan variant can be made by mixing walnuts, fresh basil, olive oil and small amounts (such as a table spoon per cup) of white miso paste.

== The traditional method should come first ==

I suggest to invert the sequency of methods, to the more logic one:
a) traditional method using a mortar...... etc
b) the modern method (I would call it mechanic, and not modern) comes only after, 

Further to this I suggest to better highlight that the traditional (normal) method is preferable to the modern one for many reasons (some of them are already included into the recepy) &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Luigi.tessiore|Luigi.tessiore]] ([[User talk:Luigi.tessiore|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Luigi.tessiore|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;

:Agreed. Also, pignoli are not optional. Toasted pine nuts are ESSENTIAL to pesto. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:71.60.18.106|71.60.18.106]] ([[User talk:71.60.18.106|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.60.18.106|contribs]]) .&lt;/small&gt;

::Not all pestos contain pignoli, or toasted pine nuts.  For instance, my mother's family is Italian, and they don't use toasted pine nuts in their pesto at all.  It's just basil, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil.  For creamy pesto, they would add cream cheese. [[User:Marcus2|Marcus2]] ([[User talk:Marcus2|talk]]) 14:58, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

==Nursery rhymes==
Children learn a lot of language skills by playing, singing, dancing. They know how to make learning fun. This is why children's songs and rhymes are a wonderful way to acquire a foreign language. Here are three examples. Enjoy being a child again!

== Poesje en Hondje ==
The following text was taken from a Mother Goose rhyme and translated into Dutch.&lt;ref&gt; The original appears in the [http://www.gutenberg.org Project Gutenberg] text 'Verse and Prose for Beginners in Reading'.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get a literal translation, the Dutch text was not made to rhyme. 

Note that in Dutch the word ''poesje'' does ''not'' have the same connotation as in English. It merely means ''pussycat''.

The meter in the Dutch version is nearly perfect and should provide hints for pronouncing the words.&lt;br/&gt;
Lekkere is pronounced as 'le-kre' in this case, to fit the meter (but this poetic license, not non-standard pronunciation).

Now that you understand the poem, go see a video of it, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPFmcJAp7Y see here] (Notice that in some dialects ''ij'' and ''ei'' are pronounced more like [ɑɪ̯] than as [ɛɪ̯].)

There is a pretty astounding [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66pEJ-zMH6s 'performance'] of this song by (the late) Corrina Konijnenburg that was recorded in 1967 in a children's show by ''Dorus'' (real name Tom Manders). Note that the performer took a few liberties. Notice that she pronounces poesje as ''poessie'' as is usual in Hollandic dialects.

==Ingredients==
*2 rice cooker cups (12 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|US fl oz]] in total, or 1.5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s) (360 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].
*10 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s (1.9 [[Cookbook:L|L]]) water
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tablespoon]] (15 mL) fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], chopped
*1 Tablespoon fresh [[Cookbook:Chive|chive]]s, chopped
*1 Tablespoon fresh [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], chopped
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], ground
*2 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]]s (about 1 kg) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], cubed

==Procedure==
#Add the rice, water, parsley, chives, rosemary, and pepper to a 10 cup or larger [[Cookbook:Rice Cooker|rice cooker]].
#For a simple rice cooker, turn it on. For a fancy (fuzzy logic) rice cooker, set the rice cooker to the ''quick cook'' setting and start.
#Cover and allow to come to a [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]].
#Add the beef and cinnamon, cover again, and allow to cook for 60 minutes.

Where do you get these fuzzy logic cookers, havent seen them in Scotland yet.
[[User:TonyClarke|TonyClarke]] 00:53, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Not sure what to say.  They've been in the US for about 5 years, and available in Japan for five years before that.  You might try an Asian supermarket, if you have any near you in Scotland, as the one near me (in California) has models you otherwise can't buy in the US.  Here's a site in the US that will ship them internationally, as I havn't been able to locate a UK merchant. [http://www.mrslinskitchen.com/cgi-bin/kitstore/kitshop.cgi?ACTION=ENTER&amp;thispage=R305.html&amp;ORDER_ID=!ORDERID!] [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 15:29, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Of course, it doesn't matter anymore, as I went back and checked ''The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook'', and was wrong, soups can be done in any type of cooker, on the normal setting. Now I've got to change the article. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

Thanks for the information Gentgeen. Maybe I haven't looked out for them, I try to follow a raw food  diet so cooking is  an infrequent event for me! Thanks again

Reduced the amound of rice and increased the water because when I tried it, the rice sucked up all the water.  [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:28, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</text>

{{spice}}

'''Ginger''' is used extensively as a cooking ingredient or [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] in [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian cuisine]] and others. It is part of mainstream western food in [[Cookbook:Ginger beer|ginger beer]] and [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] such as [[Cookbook:Gingerbread|gingerbread]] and [[Cookbook:Ginger Snap|ginger snaps]] (a type of cookie). Though generally called &quot;root&quot;, it is actually the [[Cookbook:Rhizome|rhizome]] of the plant ''Zingiber officinalis''.  

Young ginger roots are juicy and fleshy with a very mild taste.
They are often pickled in [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] as a snack or just cooked as an ingredient in many dishes.
Mature ginger roots are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from old ginger roots is extremely hot and is often used as a spice in Chinese cooking to cover up other strong odors and flavors such as in seafood and mutton.

[[Image:ARS_ginger.jpg|thumb|right|25.4-pound ginger root]]
Ginger is also made into candy, is used as a flavoring for cookies and cake,
and is the main flavor in &quot;ginger ale&quot;, a sweet, carbonated, non-alcoholic
beverage.

Dried and powdered ginger is used to add spiciness to gingerbread and other recipes. It tastes quite different from fresh ginger, and they cannot be substituted for each other.

Ginger is grown throughout the tropical areas of the world.  The most expensive, and highest quality varieties, generally come from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]] while most mass market ginger is grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]].

A related plant known as ''[[Cookbook:Galangal|galangal]]'' is often used for similar purposes
in various [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-East Asian cuisines]].

[[Image:Milk glass.jpg|thumb|Milk is a common [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|ingredient]] in many [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] and [[Cookbook:Bread|breads]].  It also can be served as a beverage.]]
The milk of some mammals, particularly cows, goats, sheep, and buffalo, is collected for human consumption, either directly, usually after pasteurization, or is processed into [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy product]]s such as [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]], or [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]].  When used alone, ''milk'' almost always refers to cow's milk.

Another use is to refer to plant-based milks, usually [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] or rice milk; typical variations are [[Cookbook:Almond Milk|almond milk]], oat milk, hemp milk, and banana milk.  These can either be made at home or bought commercially; they rarely include any animal milk or animal milk by-products, and so can be eaten by those who can't digest lactose or casein. They can be substituted for animal milk in recipes in some situations, although they may impact the flavour or texture of the resulting dish.  These milks should be treated much as animal milk - that is, they should be refrigerated, especially after opening, and used within a few days.

When raw animal milk is left standing for a while, it turns sour. This is the result of [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermentation]]: lactic acid bacteria naturally present in raw animal milk turn the animal milk sugar into lactic acid. This fermentation process is exploited in the production of various dairy products.

Pasteurized animal milk does not have these bacteria, so instead of souring it will putrefy if kept unrefrigerated, and should be stored between 1 °C and 4 °C. The putrefaction of animal milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (UHT, also known as ultra-pasteurization) treatment; animal milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened.

Lactose in animal milk is digested with the help of the enzyme lactase produced by the bodies of infants.  In humans, production of lactase falls off in adulthood, in many cases to the point where lactose becomes indigestible, leading to lactose intolerance, a gastrointestinal condition that afflicts many. 

Casein is the main protein in animal milk, and is particularly concentrated in cheese made with animal milk. Whey is the other major protein in animal milk, and is separated from casein in the manufacturing process of cheese made with animal milk. Both proteins can provoke undesirable symptoms in some people, although casein intolerance is more widely recognised and is often connected with gluten intolerance and coeliac disease.

Milk possesses the ability to reduce the perceived spiciness level of some spicy foods thanks to the casein which binds with capsaicin oil and then carries it away.

{{spice}}

'''Cinnamon''' is a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] obtained from the inner bark of a small evergreen tree native to [[w:Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]. Cinnamon is principally employed in cookery as a condiment and flavouring material, being largely used in the preparation of some kinds of [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] and [[Cookbook:liqueur|liqueur]]s.

The best cinnamon is from Sri Lanka, but the tree is also grown at Tellicherry, in [[w:Java island|Java]], the [[w:West Indies|West Indies]], [[w:Brazil|Brazil]], and [[w:Egypt|Egypt]]. Sri Lanka cinnamon of fine quality is a very thin smooth bark, with a light-yellowish brown colour, a highly fragrant odour, and a peculiarly sweet, warm and pleasing aromatic taste. 

Its flavour is due to an aromatic oil which it contains to the extent of from 0.5 to 1%. This essential oil, as an article of commerce, is prepared by roughly pounding the bark, macerating it in sea-water, and then quickly distilling the whole. It is of a golden-yellow colour, with the peculiar odour of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste.

Being a much more costly spice than [[Cookbook:Cassia|cassia]], that comparatively harsh-flavoured substance is frequently substituted for or added to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''route''' is the path that data takes when travelling through a network from one host to another. Routing is the process by which the path, or some subset of it, is determined. One of the characteristic features of the Internet, as compared to other network architectures, is that each node that receives a packet will typically determine for itself what the next step in the path should be.

&lt;!-- Provide links to descriptions of other network architectures above. --&gt;

IP routing decisions are generally made based on the destination of network traffic.  When an IP packet is sent from a node on the network, it will consult its ''routing table'' to determine the next hop device that the traffic should be sent to, in order for it to reach its final destination.  The routing table on a typical home machine may look something like this (except formatted properly :):

&lt;!-- Argh! How do you make this use a fixed-width font!?! It lies about starting with a space doing it! --&gt;
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
 x.y.z           *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0
 192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
 127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
 default         x.y.z           0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 ppp0

So, for example, when it receives a packet on interface eth0 which has a destination of 216.239.59.104, it will consult the table and see that it should send it through the default interface, the host x.y.z, which is on interface ppp0.

The routing table is constructed from a combination of statically defined routes and those learned from dynamic routing protocols.

Statically defined routes may be declared at system boot time, or via a command line interface.  They will generally include the following parameters:
* '''Destination''' - this may be either a single host, or a network (in which case a network mask is also required).
* '''Gateway''' - the device to which traffic with the defined destination should be sent. 

Static routes may also include the following parameters:
*'''Interface''' - the interface through which the traffic to a destination must be sent.  (Most OSs can determine this automatically)
*'''Metric''' - the number of 'hops' away that the gateway is from this host.  For a gateway that resides on a directly connected network, the metric is '1'.

The ''default route'' is a special case of a statically defined route.  It is the route of last resort.  All traffic that does not match another destination in the routing table is forwarded to the default gateway.

Dynamic routing protocols allow network attached devices to learn about the structure of the network dynamically from peer devices.  This reduces the administrative effort required to implement and change routing throughout a network.  Some examples of dynamic routing protocols are:

* '''RIP''' (Routing Information Protocol)
* '''OSPF''' (Open Shortest Path First)
* '''ISIS''' (Intermediate system to intermediate system)
* '''BGP''' (Border Gateway Protocol)
* '''IGRP''' (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

ISIS and OSPF are link-state protocols, meaning each node part of the same zone, will know the state of all the link in the mesh. Due to the exponential number of link in a mesh, thoses protocols are for small mesh such as an ISP national backbone.

RIP is usually used to easily announce customer's routes in a backbone.

BGP is used as an external routing protocol to exchange routes with other entities. ISP use BGP extensivly to &quot;trade&quot; their routes. It can also be used to carry customers routes accross a network, in a MPLS backbone for example.

{{spice}}

'''Nutmeg''' and mace are two spices derived from the same plant, the nutmeg tree (''Myristica fragrans'').
The nutmeg tree is indigenous to the Banda Islands of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]] but is also grown in the [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]] (e.g., Grenada). Several commercial products are produced from the nutmeg tree, nutmeg and mace being the best known. Nutmeg is the actual seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about an inch long, while mace is the dried &quot;lacy&quot;, reddish covering of the seed.

Other products include their essential oils. Other nutmeg tree species include the ''M. argentea'' which produces 'Papuan' nutmegs from Papua (Indonesia) and Papua New Guinea, and ''M. malabarica'' which produces 'Bombay' nutmegs from [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_India|India]]; both are used as adulterants of ''M. fragrans'' products. 

The spices in their ground form are mainly used in the food processing industry, principally in the seasoning of meat products; they are also used in soups, sauces, baked goods and spice mixes such as [[Cookbook:Curry|curry]] powder in [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Japan|Japan]]. Both spices have similar taste qualities; mace is more popular in light coloured foods because of its light orange colour. Mace tends to be sweeter and more delicate.

The essential oil is obtained by the steam distillation of ground nutmeg. The oil is colourless or light yellow and smells and tastes of nutmeg. Essential nutmeg oil as such is used as natural food flavouring in baked goods, syrups, beverages (e.g., cola), sweets, etc. It replaces ground nutmeg as it leaves no particles in the food.

Nutmeg is extremely toxic when injected intravenously. Excessive consumption of the spice is also dangerous and can lead to death. Nutmeg can also cause hallucinations when taken in excess, along with nausea, dehydration, and generalised body pain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* My name is Hal Newnan. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Macomb (MIchigan's) Community College's South Campuses's Graphic Communication Arts (since renamed) program with 2 Associates Degrees: 1) in Electronic Publishing, and 2) in Illustration. 

The point made in the statistic noted in the Wiki Graphic Design book is well taken! Probably less than 10% of the graduates of any given program will find their way into any kind of work related to their studies. Less than 2-5% are likely to achieve positions of high rank or pay. One of our program's directors, Brian Sauriol, speaks at length of the dedication he has admired in other graphic artists who have soared to the pinnacles of success through (often) grim determination and disciplined hard work. Perhaps the wealthy do fall flat on their faces.

As a mid-life career switcher, I was advised (by a friend who had followed her graphic design career from college in NYC to advertising agencies there, and still works it in Ann Arbor, MI) to find work at a print house. This I have done through our Co-op Industrial program. 

I can highly recommend this course of action, it is grounding me in completing practical tasks for my employer (like building and modifying their website) and doing their brochure and logo work. I also get frequent chances to work with Illustrator to design labels for our customers as well as for our owners. 

I see that Brian's finding teaching work helps him to stay on top of developments in the profession.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Articles'''&lt;/big&gt;

Articles can be definite or indefinite.

In both cases, as in the other Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, articles have two genders: masculine and feminine. Number can be singular or plural.

The most general paradigm for the definite article is:

#'''masculine, singular:'''   o  
#'''feminine, singular:'''   a
#'''masculine, plural:'''   os
#'''feminine, plural:'''   as

Gender and number must agree with that of the noun (and adjective).

#'''O''' mesache ye en '''a''' borda = The boy is in the shepherd's hut.
#'''As''' mesachas son en '''o''' lugar = The girls are in the village.

----
&lt;Big&gt;&lt;big&gt; Einfache Mathematik ~ &lt;/big&gt;Simple Mathematics&lt;/Big&gt;

== Lernen 7 ~ Zählen von 13 bis 100 ==
Once you have memorized the numbers from 1 to 12 (see [[German/Lesson 3|Lernen 3]]), counting higher in German becomes very much like counting in English. From 13 to 19, add ''-zehn'' (10; &quot;-teen&quot; in English) after the cardinal number root: 

13 &amp;ndash; ''dreizehn'' (irregular in English: '&lt;u&gt;thir&lt;/u&gt;teen')&lt;br&gt;
14 &amp;ndash; ''vierzehn''&lt;br&gt;
15 &amp;ndash; ''fünfzehn''&lt;br&gt;
16 &amp;ndash; ''sechzehn'' (note that the 's' in ''sechs'' is dropped and the 'ch' is pronounced like the 'ch' in ''ich'')&lt;br&gt;
17 &amp;ndash; ''siebzehn'' (note that the 'en' in ''sieben'' is dropped)&lt;br&gt;
18 &amp;ndash; ''achtzehn''&lt;br&gt;
19 &amp;ndash; ''neunzehn''

Above 19 the counting system is constant: add ''-zig'' (&quot;-ty&quot; in English) to the cardinal root. Thus, we get:

20 &amp;ndash; ''zwanzig''&lt;br&gt;
21 &amp;ndash; ''einundzwanzig'' (note: 'one-and-twenty')&lt;br&gt;
22 &amp;ndash; ''zweiundzwanzig'' (note: 'two-and-twenty')&lt;br&gt;

And the same for 30, 40, 50....etc.

30 &amp;ndash; ''dreißig'' (this is an exception to the -zig Rule)&lt;br&gt;
40 &amp;ndash; ''vierzig''&lt;br&gt;
50 &amp;ndash; ''fünfzig''&lt;br&gt;
60 &amp;ndash; ''sechzig''&lt;br&gt;
70 &amp;ndash; ''siebzig''&lt;br&gt;
80 &amp;ndash; ''achtzig''&lt;br&gt;
90 &amp;ndash; ''neunzig''&lt;br&gt;
100 &amp;ndash; ''hundert''

So, combining these, we get:

34&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ''vierunddreißig'' (note: 'four-and-thirty')&lt;br&gt;
143 &amp;ndash; ''hundertdreiundvierzig'' (note: 'hundred-three-and-forty')&lt;br&gt;
170 &amp;ndash; ''hundertsiebzig''&lt;br&gt;
199 &amp;ndash; ''hundertneunundneunzig''

It would be excellent practice towards learning these numbers by counting (in German, of course) from 1 to 199&amp;mdash;or counting along any continuous sequence that comes to mind. For example, start with your age and count to 50 (count down if appropriate).

== Grammatik 7-1 ~ Math Calculations ==

The following table presents the symbols used for basic mathematics.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''plus''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;-&lt;/big&gt;
| ''minus''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/big&gt;
| ''mal''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;&amp;divide;&lt;/big&gt;
| ''geteilt/dividiert durch''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;=&lt;/big&gt;
| ''ist gleich''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
| ''ist größer als''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;&lt;&lt;/big&gt;
| ''ist kleiner als''
|-
! &lt;big&gt;3²&lt;/big&gt;
| ''drei hoch zwei''
|}

We can use these symbols to ask and answer simple problems in mathematics. Some of the examples that follow include first a question (''Frage'') and then the answer (''Antwort''):
  ''Wieviel ist sechs und sieben?''            How much is 6 and 7?   
     ''Sechs und sieben ist dreizehn''            6 and 7 is 13
  ''Wieviel ist fünfzig plus achtzehn?''       How much is 50 + 18?
     ''Fünfzig plus achtzehn ist gleich achtundsechzig''  50 + 18 = 68
  ''Wieviel ist siebzig minus zehn?''          How much is 70 - 10?
     ''Siebzig minus zehn ist gleich sechzig''     70 - 10 = 60
  ''Wieviel ist neun durch drei?''             How much is 9 divided by 3?
     ''Neun durch drei ist gleich drei''          9 &amp;divide; 3 = 3
  ''Funf ist größer als zwei''                 5 &gt; 2
  ''Acht ist kleiner als siebzehn''            8 &lt; 17

== Vokabeln 7-1 ==
Counting to 199 is also included in the vocabulary for ''Lektion 7''.

== Hub Bearings ==

Over time the bearings in the hubs of a bicycle wheel may come out of adjustment causing the wheel to wobble from side to side (this can also be the result of the wheel being out of true; a sure sign of loose bearings is that the rim can be moved laterally in the fork by hand). Additionally, road dirt and moisture infiltrate the bearings, causing rough operation and premature wear. Even if these issues do not arise, the bearings' lubrication will eventually need to be replaced in order to maintain the life and health of the hubs. These problems can be addressed by overhauling the hubs. The basic techniques are similar to maintaining any other ball bearing assemblies, whether the headset or bottom bracket on the bike, or on complete different applications.

On some recent model mountain bikes, there has been a rash of rear hubs getting significant play after only a few rides; this may be due to bad cones or lock nuts.  The drive side lock nut should be your number one suspect in this case if the bike is new.

==Parts of the hub==
[[Image:Labeled Bicycle Hub Comparison-en.svg|right|thumb|A diagram showing two types of rear hubs: a freehub, and a threaded hub for freewheels.]]
From the inside out:
*Shell
*Bearing cup
*Bearings
*Bearing cone
*Dust cover
*Lock washer
*Lock nut
*Axle
*Quick release skewer

===Shell===
Main body of hub, holds the axle assembly and is the connection point for the spokes.

===Bearing Cup===
Is pressed into the shell.

===Bearing Cone===
Forms the outside bearing races, fits onto axle, usually adjustable.

===Bearings===
There are three major types of bearings in use on bicycle hubs:

====Cup and Cone types====
*Loose ball bearings are placed individually in the bearing race
*Caged bearings are simply loose ball bearings held in a framework, which simplifies their insertion in the hub. They differ from sealed, or cartridge, bearings in that the bearings are visible in a simple cage made of a circular piece of sheet metal with holes punched for the bearings, and the bearings can be inserted and replaced into the cage with simple hand tools, or even just with the fingers. Cup and cone bearing hubs also usually have some form of sealing but it is separate to the bearings.

====Cartridge type====
*Cartridge bearings are assembled and sealed in a permanently assembled cartridge, which renders them inaccessible. Cartridge bearings which have sealing have the advantage of being highly resistant to infiltration by dust and moisture, and usually needing no adjustment. They will generally last many years without service. If they do fail, they are simply replaced. Some hubs cannot be disassembled when the cartridge bearings are worn or fail; the more expensive ones can sometime be serviced by the manufacturer...

== Cleaning and repacking a traditional cone and cup front hub ==

*Place the wheel flat. Have something under the hub to catch loose bearings (unless you know for certain that they aren't loose). Usually, it does not matter which side of the wheel is up, however a few nonstandard axles have the cone on one side cast as an integral non-removable part of the axle and therefore the other cone must be on the top side for removal. This will be obvious to inspection.
*Using a box or cone wrench, unscrew the lock nut from the cone. It will be necessary to hold the cone from rotating while doing this; this will usually require a cone wrench, as the width of a normal open or adjustable wrench head is too great to fit on a normal cone. 
*Remove lock washer and any other hardware.
*Unscrew bearing cone
*Pry out circular dust cover situated above bearings (this may also be done after axle is removed, as is necessary on the bottom side of the wheel)
*Separate wheel and axle
At this point, depending on how the grease is distributed on the parts, the ball bearings may well stick to the axle, or drop out of the hub or into the axle hole through the hub, or remain in the cup. If the bearings are in a cage, they will generally remain in place unless the cage has been excessively worn.

It is advisable to leave the other cone and locknut assembly undisturbed in its position on the axle, as this will allow you to maintain the original side to side alignment of the axle assembly in the hub as much as possible. (Of course, this is mandatory where this assembly is not removable). It can be cleaned and greased in this condition. (If the cone is damaged, then it will need to be disassembled and replaced).
*Clean and inspect the bearings. Be prepared to replace any that are cracked or pitted. Most mechanics simply replace all loose bearings with new ones, as the cost is minimal compared to the labor involved in cleaning and examining old ones, and if the hub is reassembled with a bad or dirty ball it will rapidly wear. Similarly, caged bearings are usually replaced as a set, cage and all; in most cases, however, it is advantageous to replace caged bearings with loose bearings of the same size, as this results in a greater number of bearings in the hub, providing greater area and therefore greater resistance to wear, at the expense of only slightly more difficulty in keeping track of the bearings during assembly.
*Clean and inspect bearing cones. There should be no scratches or rough spots at all in the smooth track caused by the rolling bearings. A damaged cone can usually be replaced.
*Clean and inspect cups.
*The cup is factory pressed into the hub shell or sometimes cast as part of the shell, and is not generally user removable. Once again, the track of the rolling bearings should be completely free of scratches or rough spots. If the cup is damaged, sometimes a shop with a press can replace it. 
*Grease bearing cups
*Re-insert bearings, which should be held in place by the grease
*Put another layer of grease on top of the bearings
*Re-insert dust covers
*Re-assemble by reinserting axle from underside, and replacing the cone, washer(s) and lock nut on top.
*Adjust as necessary. For ball bearings the adjustment is somewhat particular; there should be no excessive drag from over tightening, but also no excessive play from looseness. Although the proper adjustment is pretty obvious by &quot;feel&quot;, tightening the locknut on the cone usually disturbs the adjustment enough to throw it off; therefore a bit of experience helps to estimate to what tightness the bearings should be adjusted, before tightening the locknut to produce the correct result afterwards. In practice, usually three wrenches are needed; one on the locknut, a cone wrench on the cone, and a third wrench on the locknut and cone assembly on the underside of the wheel, presumably firmly gripping the axle. This provides the ability to minutely tighten or loosen the top cone and locknut independently until the perfect tightness is achieved.

== Maintaining a cartridge bearing hub ==

[[Image:Cartridge_hub.png|right|thumb|An example of a cartridge hub]]

There are many different designs so this is just an overview of the basic principles that can be used to service most cartridge bearing hubs.

===Clean and lubricate bearings===

If you ride in wet conditions you may be able to extend the life of the bearings by periodically cleaning and lubricating them. In most circumstances this is not required and the bearing will have an acceptable life with no maintenance.
The idea is to remove one of the seals from the bearing so it can be cleaned and fresh grease applied.
*Typically the end caps block access to the seal so need to be removed. The method of attachment varies from hub to hub. Some just press on and can be pulled off by hand, others screw onto the axle and have flats for removal with a spanner or are held on by set screws. The end caps may also be part of the axle itself and the axle is removed by inserting an allen key into each end of the axle and unscrewing.

*Now there is access to the seal it is removed. This can be done by prying it out with a razor blade or small flat head screwdriver.

*Clean the bearing using degreaser and or rag.

*Apply fresh grease, a [[w:Grease_gun_(tool)|grease gun]] makes the job easier.

*Push the seal back into place and replace the end caps.

===Replace bearings===

Replacement bearings can be sourced from good bike shop or from any bearing supplier. Typically bearings are identified from the numbers on the side of the bearing, take the old bearings with you to make sure you get the correct replacements.

Removing old bearings.

* Remove end caps. Some just press on and can be pulled off by hand, others screw onto the axle and have flats for removal with a spanner or are held on by set screws. The end caps may also be part of the axle itself and the axle is removed by inserting an allen key into each end of the axle and unscrewing.

* Remove axle. Use a rubber mallet to hammer the axle out of the hub. The step on the axle will push one of the bearings out of the hub shell. Remove the bearing from the axle and use the axle to remove the other bearing from the hub shell.

* Some hubs do not use an axle with steps for the bearings to push against. These typically have a spacer instead. To remove the bearings push the spacer to the side and use a rubber mallet and a large flat head screwdriver to push the bearings out of the hub.

* Clean and inspect the hub shell and axle.

Installing new bearings.

Cartridge bearings are not good at absorbing side loads. When being pressed into the hub the force needs to be pushing on the outer metal ring to avoid damaging the bearing. A suitable sized [[w:Socket_wrench|socket]] can be used to do this.
[[Image:Cartridge_socket.png|right|thumb|Pressing in a cartridge bearing with socket]]
* Lightly grease hub shell and axle where bearing will sit.

* Press a bearing into one side of the hub shell. Use a rubber mallet and socket trying to keep the bearings as straight as possible.

* Insert the axle or spacer.

* Press the second bearing into the hub. The bearing should be pushed in far enough that there are no side loads on the bearing. With good quality hubs you should just be able to push it in all the way and have everything line up. Cheaper hubs may require care to avoid putting side loads on the bearing. If the hub has a spacer to help keep it lined up you can insert the axle part way into the underside of the hub.

* Put the end caps back on.

'''Cleaning parts''' can be done with a cleaning solution of some kind, and/or with a rag or stiff brush.
A couple of notes about cleaning products:
*Solvents must be thoroughly cleaned off parts that are to be re-lubricated. Residual solvent will have a solvent effect on the replacement lubricant.
*Even a bio-degradable solvent will have whatever substance it removed mixed in with it after use, and thus must be treated according to both the laws applicable to the solvent itself and the dissolved substances.
== Power Washer ==
Using a power washer is an option in some situations, but care must be taken not to displace lubricant from parts. A high pressure stream of water is capable of displacing the grease from a bearing surface, including from sealed bearings, which are not designed to be lubricated by the user. Some very powerful power washers can also take the paint off of a bike. As such it is not recommended to clean a bike with a power washer because it is very hard to dry the water and replace the grease.

==Cleaning and lubricating a bicycle chain==

Cleaning and lubricating your chain is one of the simplest and most important things to do to keep your bike in good working order.  It is also an activity that draws intense debate with many people insisting that their way is the &quot;Right&quot; way to do it.  The short story is, the cleaner and better lubricated your chain is the longer the entire drivetrain (the chain and gears) will last, but no drive-train lasts forever.  It is worth spending time taking care of your drivetrain, it's not worth obsessing about.

You need:
*Lubricant, 
*A couple Rags
*Old toothbrush

The choice of lubricant is important.  '''DO NOT''' use WD40* as it is too thin and will evaporate leaving nothing to lubricate the chain.  Use special bike chain lube found at any bike store.  Some lubricants are formulated for wet conditions, others for dry.  The difference is the viscosity.  A dry lube used in wet conditions will require more frequent applications, a wet lube used in dry conditions will gather dirt, and require more frequent cleaning.

Prior to lubricating, clean the chain as well as possible.  Usually a chain cleaning tool, or a toothbrush is sufficient. [[Bicycles/Maintenance and Repair/Chains/Removing a Bicycle Chain|Remove the chain]] from the bicycle and soak it in a solvent such as a cycle degreaser. Hang up chain to dry off.  Paraffin will also work, but is unpleasant and unhealthy to work with environmentally hazardous, and flammable; as such it is not recommended.

Dirt is what causes a chain to wear out, so keeping your chain as clean as possible extends its life, and the life of the entire drivetrain.  

Apply the lubricant on the chain non-pressurized drip type lubes are recommended as are more accurate, and waste less lube than spray lubricants.

Put a rag behind the chain so that the lube does not contaminate the tires or other parts of the bike. Rotate the pedals to move the chain and lubricate the whole length.  Wipe the chain with the rag to remove the excessive lubricant, as this just gathers dirt and does not help lubricate the chain.

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salad]]

The '''Caesar salad''' is a traditional salad served in American restaurants, often prepared table side. It is referred to by some as the &quot;king&quot; of salads. 

Its origin is largely credited to Italian immigrant Caesar Cardini, a restaurateur and chef in Tijuana, Baja California del Norte, Mexico.  Cardini reportedly tossed the first such salad table side at his restaurant on July 4, 1924.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 head Romaine lettuce, roughly chopped&lt;ref group=&quot;N&quot;&gt;Contrary to popular belief, chopping the lettuce will '''''not''''' cause the edges to brown. If we were using a more delicate leaf, say radicchio, then we would tear it, but we're using Romaine, which isn't that delicate.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1/4 cup (about 50ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 2 [[Cookbook:Soft Boiled Eggs|soft-boiled eggs]] 
* Heavy pinch of sea salt. Don't use table salt, or else you're not making Caesar salad.
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Drizzle red wine vinegar
* 3 shots Worcestershire sauce
* Garlic croûtons (below)

== Procedure==
#Drizzle lettuce with 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil. Toss to coat.
#Add salt and pepper. Toss to coat.
#Add vinegar and toss to coat.
#Drizzle Worcestershire sauce over lettuce. Toss to coat.
#Crack eggs over salad. Toss to coat.
#Top with garlic croûtons and serve.

== Notes ==
&lt;references group=&quot;N&quot;/&gt;

== Garlic Croûtons ==
===Ingredients===
* 1 stale loaf Italian bread, cut into 2-inch (5cm) cubes
* 1/4 cup (about 50ml) olive oil
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper

===Procedure===

''Contributed to Lesson 1A, but concept not really introduced until Lesson 5'':


 Beispiel an          ''können'' (can)    ''gehen'' (go)     ''sein'' (to be)
 pronoun              verb I (irreg?) verb II        verb III (irregular)
 Basicform            können          gehen          sein
 ich                  kann            gehe           bin
 du                   kannst          gehst          bist
 er/sie/es            kann            geht           ist
 wir                  können          gehen          sind
 ihr                  könnt           geht           seid
 sie                  können          gehen          sind
 Sie (formal)         können          gehen          sind

As you can see, any verb uses the same declination for wir, sie and Sie.
Also, er/sie/es uses the same declination for all three genders.
NOTE: Moved to Lesson 6

''Used this story for [[German/Level III/Markus Studiert]] since it nicely followed your other Markus conversation. But I could not match ''holt'' or ''holt aus'' to any verb. Can you help? '' -- holt is from holen, holt aus is from ausholen, which has another meaning, but &quot;holen&quot; is meant here in the sense of &quot;fetching a book out of the shelf&quot; (trying to match the German sentence literally)

Markus ist in der Universität. Er trinkt dort einen Kaffee und ißt ein Brötchen. Danach geht er in die Bibliothek. Er sucht ein Buch über Biochemie. Er '''holt das Buch aus''' dem Regal und setzt sich an einen Tisch. Nach einer Stunde geht er in den Hof und raucht eine Zigarette. Danach geht er an den Tisch zurück. Er denkt: &quot;Wenigstens eine Stunde...&quot; und stellt das Buch wieder in das Regal. Heute ist nicht sein Tag.

''There are already lessons completed for some of these points. However, it might be that the stories or conversations need to made easier to read in those lessons.''
 
What should be explained here?
* Genders
* Articles: der, die das, ein, eine, ein.
* Nominativ, Dativ and Akkusativ. (We could live without Genitiv for a while)
* Daklinations with articles. 
* Keep everything in singular.

''Note that the book layout is such that the Advanced lessons add to the basic lesson (1A furthers something taught in 1), but 1A cannot be the place where anything basic is introduced, as the berginning student should not even visit Lesson 1A until later''.


Just wondering, but isn't this very limited for Advanced Level? I would like like some help for the Wirtschaftsdeutsch Prüfung but this isn't going to help me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi there! Welcome to this Wikibook on the wonderful world of Bourne Shell Scripting!

This book will cover the practical aspects of using and interacting with the Bourne Shell, the root of all shells in use in the [[en:Unix|Unix]] world. That includes interacting with the shell on a day-to-day basis for the purposes of operating the computer in normal tasks, as well as grouping together commands in files (scripts) which can be run over and over again. Since it's not practical to talk about the Bourne Shell in complete isolation, this will also mean some short jaunts into the wondrous world of Unix; not far, just enough to understand what is going on and be able to make full use of the shell's very wide capabilities.

There are also some things this book '''won't''' do for you. This book is not an in-depth tutorial on any kind of programming theory -- you won't learn the finer points of program construction and derivation or the mathematical backings of program development here. This book also won't teach you about [[en:Linux|Linux]] or any other type of Unix or Unix itself or any other operating system any more than is necessary to teach you how to use the shell. Nothing to be found here about [[en:Apache|Apache]], joe, [[Learning the vi Editor|vi]], or any other specific program. Nor will we cover firewalls and networking.

We ''will'' cover the Bourne Shell, beginning with the basic functionality and capabilities as they existed in the initial release, through to the added functionality specified by the international POSIX standard POSIX 1003.1 for this shell. We will have to give you ''some'' programming knowledge, but we hope that everyone will readily understand the few simple concepts we explain.

Having said that, the authors hope you will find this book a valuable resource for learning to use the shell and for using the shell on a regular basis. And that you might even have some fun along the way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a summary of Scott McCloud's  &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;.

== Chapter 1: Setting the Record Straight ==

Comics is a [[w:medium|medium]], not a [[w:genre|genre]].

In one of the few previous books discussing [[w:comic book|comics]] as a medium, [[w:Will Eisner|Will Eisner]]'s ''[[w:Comics and Sequential Art|Comics and Sequential Art]]'', comics is defined, unexpectedly, as Sequential Art.  Here McCloud expands and formalizes that definition (in a rare panel that reduces neatly to pure text):  &quot;'''com.ics''' (kom'iks) '''n.''' plural in form, used with a singular verb. '''1.''' Juxtaposed pictoral and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer.&quot;

The definition is dense (in the book it is developed over several pages, with McCloud's cartoon [[w:avatar|avatar]] taking questions from an audience), but to quote another part of the chapter&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The secret is not in what the definition says but what it ''doesn't'' say! || 

For example, our definition says nothing about superheroes or funny animals.  Nothing about fantasy/science fiction or reader age.  No genres are listed in our definition, no types of subject matter, no styles of prose or poetry. || 

Nothing is said about paper and ink.  No printing process is mentioned.  Printing ''itself'' isn't even specified!&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  Nothing is said about technical pens or bristol board or Windsor &amp; Newton Finest Sable Series 7 Number 2 Brushes!&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  No materials are ruled out by our definition.  No tools are prohibited. || 

There is no mention of black lines and flat colored ink.  No calls for exaggerated anatomy or for representational art of any kind.  No schools of art are banished by our definition, no philosophies, no movements, no ways of seeing are out of bounds!&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like text, comics can be used in uncountable ways; unlike text, its potential has until recently been tragically squandered.

=== Footnotes ===

# In quoting without pictures, a lot has to be left out (here I've denoted frame breaks with || ).  One of the joys of this book, and one of many reasons it has to be in comics, is that the phenomena talked about in the text are often played out in the art (to oversimplify a complex and interdependent relationship).  Some simple examples: later in the book, in the middle of  the explanation of the effects of the ''non sequitor'' panel transition, the narrative is interrupted by a panel containing only a fork.  In Chapter 2, after explaining Magritte's [[w:The Treachery of Images|The Treachery of Images]], the McCloud-[[w:avatar|avatar]] asks, &quot;Do you hear what I'm saying?  If you do, have your ears checked, because no one said a word.&quot;  In an example closer to home (if somewhat more diffuse), the quote directly following the sentence to which this is footnoted describes comics freed from the constraints of adolescent power fantasies, and lo and behold, the very comics describing this are themselves free of that mold.  McCloud points out, later, that one of the advantages of comics as a medium is the ease with which text and subtext can spar, as in [[w:Art Spiegelman|Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus]]'', where the Jews are drawn as mice and the Nazis as cats.
# In the discussion that led up to this passage, McCloud pointed out out that under his definition, artifacts like [[w:Trajan's Column|Trajan's Column]] would be comics, and traced the medium's development into the current century, highlighting notables like [[w:William Hogarth|William Hogarth]]'s [[w:A Harlot's Progress|A Harlot's Progress]], [[w:Max Ernst|Max Ernst]]'s [[w:A Week of Kindness|A Week of Kindness]], and the works of [[w:Rodolphe Topffer|Rodolphe Topffer]], [[w:Lynd Ward|Lynd Ward]], and [[w:Frans Masereel|Frans Masereel]], all of which are traditionally considered non-Comics.
# Indeed, McCloud now proudly uses a tablet and [[w:Photoshop|Photoshop]], and publishes many of his comics on [http://www.scottmccloud.com his website].
# Two footnotes in one:
#* On the other hand, McCloud points out that his definition excludes single panel works like [[w:Family Circus|Family Circus]] and [[w:the Far Side|the Far Side]].
#* These issues are further explored in ''[[w:Reinventing Comics|Reinventing Comics]]'', which focuses on the possibilities the internet creates.

== Chapter 2: The Vocabulary of Comics ==

Comics are built out of icons -- &quot;For the purposes of this chapter, I'm using the word [[w:icon|icon]] to mean any image used to represent a person, place, thing or idea.&quot;  Letters and words are completely abstract icons, bearing no physical resemblance to their ideas; pictures have varying levels of abstraction, from the photograph of a face, full of color and shading, an ink copy of photons taken in through a shutter, to '''=D'''

That [[w:smiley|smiley]], that :-) , that set of dots and lines that looks like a face to us only because our brains contain a lot of face-seeing hardware (after all, no one sees eyes in solitary colons, noses in solitary dashes), is a [[w:cartoon|cartoon]].  Cartoons focus our attention -- through simplification, by eliminating superfluous features, they amplify the features that remain -- but, McCloud explains, that is not the entirety of their drawing power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When two people interact, they usually look directly at one another, seeing their partner's features in vivid detail. || Each one also sustains a constant awareness of his or her own face, but ''this'' mind-picture is not nearly so vivid; just a sketchy arrangement...a sense of shape...a sense of ''general placement''. || Something as simple and basic as a cartoon. || Thus, when you look at a photo or a realistic drawing of a face, you see it as the face of another. || But when you enter the world of the ''cartoon'', you see ''yourself''. ... The cartoon is a vacuum into which our identity and awareness are pulled, || an empty shell that we inhabit which enables us to travel into another realm.  We don't just observe the cartoon, we ''become'' it!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(McCloud goes on to discuss how varying levels of iconism and realism are used in comics to achieve various effects -- for example, a sword might be drawn as a few quick lines in one panel, to symbolize its connectedness with the iconic character holding it (just as the car one drives becomes, to an extent, an extension of the self), and drawn as detailed and photorealistic in the next panel, as the character gazes down at its strange engravings, to symbolize its mystery, its otherness, to allow the reader to see it, rather than be it.)

The spectrum as described thus far:

real face --&gt; photograph of a face --&gt; realistic drawing --&gt; cartoony drawing --&gt; smiley

The photograph requires little cognition; it is received as pure visual input.  The smiley requires an effort, if an unconscious one, a piecing together of the abstract lines.  Continuing the spectrum to the right, McCloud argues, we arrive at the word '''FACE''' -- bold and distinct, with relatively few letters, reminiscent of prehistoric times, when words and pictures were one -- then at a more detailed description (&quot;Two eyes, one nose, one mouth&quot; is the example given), then at still higher levels of abstraction ([[w:Keats|&quot;Thy youth's proud livery, as gazed on now...&quot;]]).

reality --&gt; photo --&gt; [[w:Batman|Batman]] --&gt; [[w:Charlie Brown|Charlie Brown]] --&gt; =D --&gt; '''FACE''' --&gt; Two eyes, one nose, one mouth --&gt; ''Thy youth's proud livery, as gazed on now...''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our need for a unified ''language'' of comics sends us toward the center where words and pictures are like one side of the same coin! || But our need for ''sophistication'' in comics seems to lead us outwards, where words and pictures are most separate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to iconic abstraction, there exists abstraction of the more traditional sense, the abstraction of [[w:abstract art|abstract art]].  Thus, the spectrum becomes a pyramid:


  The [[w:Picture Plane|Picture Plane]]/[[w:Art Object|Art Object]]
                 /\\
                / [[w:Piet Mondrian|.]]\ \
               /  [[w:Jackson Pollock|.]] \  \
              /      [[w:dada|\]]   \
             /  [[w:Pablo Picasso|.]]     \    \
            / [[w:Vincent van Gogh|.]]        \   [[w:John Keats|.]]|
           [[w:Claude Monet|/]]        [[w:Matisse|.]]   \  / [[w:language|language]]
          [[w:Ansel Adams|/]][[w:Michelangelo|.]]             \/
 [[w:reality|reality]]


The pyramid has limitations, of course (Where do [[w:The Treachery Of Images|The Treachery Of Images]] and [[w:Fountain|Fountain]] fall?  Does the horizontal axis along the verbal edge dictate how the words are displayed on the page or how they describe things?) but it is a cool little invention.

== Chapter 3: Blood in the Gutter ==


&lt;pre&gt; ^_^   -_^ &lt;/pre&gt;

As part of normal life, everyone learns to assume certain things (or so one assumes) -- that the world doesn't disappear when you're not looking, for example, that the house across the street has furniture and interior walls.  &quot;As infants, we're unable to commit that act of faith.  If we can't see it, hear it, smell it, taste it or touch it, it isn't there!  The game &quot;Peek-A-Boo&quot; plays on this idea.  Gradually, we learn that even though the sight of mommy comes and goes, mommy remains. || This phenomenon of observing the parts and perceiving the whole has a name.  It's called [[w:closure|closure]].&quot;

You performed closure when you saw the lines at the top of this section as two [[w:anime|anime]] smilies; more to the point of the chapter, you performed closure when you saw the two smileys as a single ''winking'' smiley.  &quot;See that space between the panels?  That's what comics aficionados have named &quot;the gutter!&quot;  And despite its unceremonious title, the gutter plays host to much of the magic and mystery that are at the very heart of comics...If visual iconography is the [[w:semantics|vocabulary]] of comics, closure is its [[w:syntax|grammar]].&quot;

Of course, other media make use of closure as well -- in movies, our minds effortlessly connect each frame to those preceding and following it -- but comics requires conscious (or semiconscious), high-level closure between every frame.  McCloud has categorized panel-to-panel transitions into six classes:

; 1. '''Moment-to-moment''' : The same subject is displayed in adjacent instants, like a movie running jerkily on a slow computer. Very little closure is required.
; 2. '''Action-to-action''' : The focus remains on a single subject, but this time, two separate, consecutive actions are displayed (for example, the first panel might contain a car speeding along, the 2nd the car smashing into a tree).&lt;/dd&gt;
; 3. '''Subject-to-subject''' : Both panels are within the same scene or idea, but each portrays a different subject.  (&quot;John: What more could go wrong? || Catherine: Well, at least Jerry never called! || Telephone: ''Rring'' &quot;)&lt;/dd&gt;
; 4. '''Scene-to-Scene''' : Just what it sounds like: great leaps in time or space.  (&quot;Detective: He can't outrun us forever. || Image of darkened house with caption: Ten years later...&quot;)  Lots o' closure -- deductive reasoning, even -- is often required to link the panels into a single narrative.&lt;/dd&gt;
; 5. '''Aspect to aspect''' : &quot;Bypasses time for the most part and sets a wandering eye on different aspects of a place, mood, or idea.&quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
; 6. '''Non-Sequitur''' : Panels with no logical relationship.  (McCloud argues, though, that any panels placed side by side will inevitably generate the impression of some sort of relationship in the reader's mind.  &quot;--alchemy at work in the space between panels which can help us find meaning or resonance in even the most jarring of combinations.&quot;

(The transition at the top of this section, iconic and decontextualized as it is, manages to fall into two separate categories, Moment-to-moment and Action-to-action.)

Looking at how often each panel transition is used in a particular comic can reveal some interesting things.  [[w:Jack Kirby|Jack Kirby]]'s pioneering style, as invoked in a [[w:Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]] comic from [[w:1966|1966]], breaks down as follows: 65% action-to-action (type 2), 20% subject-to-subject (type 3), 15% scene-to-scene (type 4); the remaining transitions are unused.  Here's the bar graph McCloud makes of the data:


    |'''1'''|'''2'''|'''3'''|'''4'''|'''5'''|'''6'''|
    | | | | | | |
 90%| | | | | | |
    | | | | | | |

    | |'''M'''| | | | |
    | |'''M'''|'''M'''|'''.'''| | |
 10%| |'''M'''|'''M'''|'''M'''| | |

As it turns out, almost every American comic -- regardless of storytelling style, regardless of genre (with a few experimental exceptions like [[w:Art Spiegelman|Art Spiegelman]]'s early work) -- charts similarly, from issue 1 of [[w:X-Men|X-Men]] to [[w:Heartbreak Soup|Heartbreak Soup]] to [[w:Betty and Veronica|Betty and Veronica]] to [[w:Naughty Bits|Naughty Bits]] to [[w:Frank in the River|Frank in the River]] to [[w:A Contract With God|A Contract With God]] to [[Maus (graphic novel)|Maus]] to [[w:Donald Duck|Donald Duck]].  A similar survey of European comics ([[w:Squeak the Mouse|Squeak the Mouse]], [[w:Asterix|Asterix]], [[w:Welcome to Alflolol|Welcome to Alflolol]], [[w:The Long Tomorrow|The Long Tomorrow]], [[w:Manhattan|Manhattan]], [[w:Clik!|Clik!]], [[w:The Black Island|The Black Island]], [[w:The Clock Strikes|The Clock Strikes]]) yields similar results.

In [[w:Japan|Japan]], where comics developed mostly in isolation following [[w:World War II|World War II]], where they are often published in gigantic anthologies rather than tiny magazines (lessening the premium on space and thus the emphasis on concise, action-oriented transitions 2-4) the charts look quite different.  More important still, eastern culture has bequeathed an emphasis on [[w:holism|holism]] and contemplation (aspect-to-aspect works well for setting a mood), an emphasis on the power of intervals -- of silence in a song, of [[w:negative space|negative space]] in a painting.

In comics this means a renewed emphasis on the power of closure, on the strange alchemy that occurs in the gutter.  The effect is to spark the imagination, to engage every one of the five senses, rather than simply sight.  (Sadly, replicating McCloud's demonstration of this in [[w:ASCII art|ASCII art]] is prohibitively difficult.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;The comics creator asks us to join in a silent dance of the seen and unseen.  The visible and invisible. || This dance is unique to comics.  No other artform gives so much to its audience while asking so much from them as well. || This is why I think it's a mistake to see comics as a mere hybrid of graphic arts and prose fiction.  What happens between these panels is a kind of magic only comics can create.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Chapter 4: Time Frames ==

We've been trained to see a picture as a snapshot, as a single moment in time, but any student of visual physiology can tell you that the vast majority of information is taken in by a small area at the center of the field of vision; our eyes compensate for this porthole effect by darting continually around and our brains compensate by maintaining the illusion of detailed [[w:peripheral vision|peripheral vision]] (for a demonstration, try reading this sentence while keeping your eyes fixed on one of its component words).  Much [[w:modern art|modern art]] acknowledges this ([[wikipedia:Cubism|Cubism]], for example, incorporates many perspectives into one image), and so do many comics.  McCloud's example is a long panel containing several chatting family members; reading from left to right, the conversation takes maybe 15 seconds to unfold, and the expression and pose of each person matches the moment his or her particular statement is made -- &quot;one panel, containing several panels&quot;.

To some extent, then, space in comics translates into time; as your eyes cross the page they also pass through the seconds (or the hours, or the years) and while a frame generally denotes a particular moment (in addition to serving other purposes beyond the scope of this entry), ''moment'' is a slippery thing that in practice can be any length at all; in determining a more specific time period, the reader relies heavily on context, on a page's particular content, and, especially, on the sounds portrayed in the text, which we have not been conditioned to think of as having a duration of zero.

(Here there is a quick digression about direction. What would happen if instead of reading solely left-to-right, a comic was made into a labyrinth wherein at every intersection the reader could choose which direction the story takes?  What would happen if a comic was circular, its end connecting to its beginning?)

And then there's motion.  It can, of course, be portrayed through the frame transitions described in chapter 3, but shortly after the era of [[w:futurism|futurism]] had ended, shortly after the invention of the [[w:motion picture|motion picture]], comics invented the [[w:motion line|motion line]], which lies &quot;somewhere between the futurists' ''dynamic'' movement and [[w:Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s diagrammatic ''concept'' of movement.&quot;  Over a period of decades, motion lines evolved from &quot;wild, messy, almost desperate attempts to chart the paths of moving objects through space&quot; to something &quot;more refined and stylized, even ''diagrammatic''&quot;, then, eventually, &quot;became ''so'' stylized as to almost have a life and physical presence all their own!&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been trying to figure out what makes comics tick for years and I'm still amazed at the strangeness of it all. || But no matter how bizarre the workings of time in comics is -- || -- the face it presents to the reader -- || -- is one of simple normalcy. || Or the illusion of it, anyway. || It all depends on your frame of mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Chapter 5: Living in Line ==

This chapter relies very heavily on visual examples, so is difficult to summarize here.

== Chapter 6: Show and Tell ==

In the beginning, pictures and words were two sides of the same coin.  In school, at show-and-tell, you show, and you tell, interchangeably -- &quot;This is my robot...it's got one of ''these'' things&quot;; in picture books, simple words combine similarly with images.  As we grow up, we learn to separate ''show'' and ''tell'' from each other -- we paint pictures without words, and read books without pictures.

A similar progression can be traced through history.  In cave paintings, the people shown were iconic, symbol-esqe, almost like letters, as were the flat, bright [[w:The Bull Fight|images of]] the early [[w:ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[w:Crete|Crete]]ans and the line-drawings of ancient [[w:Egypt|Egypt]]; early written language, likewise, was full of the descendants of those cave paintings, [[w:pictograph|letters that were pictures]].  Words and images were side by side, at the lower-left vertex of McCloud's great pyramid.

Over the course of the next few thousand years, they diverged.  Letters sacrificed visual representation for writing ease (and, later, printing ease) and pictures grew richer and more complex until looking at them was more like looking at reality than at thoughts.

I think it would be fine to have some categorical information to each recipe (and ingredient) so that a special search can be applied. I'm thinking about things like seasonal and geographical information or classification like vegetarian, vegan and so on. Even better would be to also have things like preparation time and calories available as search terms. A visitor could then for example search for vegetarian italian dishes under 30 min prep. or similar. I think for that to work we would need a specially programmed search module and I have no clue about the MediaWiki workings in that respect... The jewel on the crown would be if you can search by ingredients: 'hmm.. I have carrots, potatoes and chicken [and hopefully some other basic ingredients]. what will I have tonight?' Any Ideas about that? --[[User:Elkmann|Elkmann]] 23:43, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)
:Not sure about the search idea (which I think would be good, but I'm not a developer), but if you click the &quot;what links here&quot; link on the side of the page from [[Cookbook:Carrot]] you end up at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Cookbook%3ACarrot this page] which lists all the recipes that link back to the carrot page, which I think is an important reason to wikify each ingredient. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:29, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:Search needs to be low-maintenence. Tagging recipes is troublesome, especially if the absense of a tag implies a meaning which is opposite to having the tag. (are all recipes ''not'' tagged as vegan known to be non-vegan, or should they appear as unknowns at the bottom of a search for vegan stuff?) I see two ways to make searching work.
:#Make it Google-like, with a synonym database generated from the redirects.
:#Make it like a music referral service. As you rate recipes, recipes become sorted according to the ratings of people with similar taste in food. This was developed for music so that a heavy metal fan would not get suggestions for country music, etc. The idea should work well for recipes.

Why are optional ingredients to be listed separately from the main list? It seems as if variations in cooking method or main ingredients (say, oranges for lemons) would make sense as a separate section at the end, but that optional ingredients (say coconut on top of a cake) should be listed in the main ingredients list. Opinions? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] Jan 7 2005

:Agreed. In some cases, I mark an ingredient as &quot;(optional)&quot;. In other cases, I list optional ingredients in a second list immediately after the first list. I don't think it is good to get terribly formal about this sort of thing; the proper answer really depends on the recipe. Some recipes do well with multiple ingredient lists, breaking things up as &quot;filling&quot; and &quot;crust&quot; or similar. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 06:35, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)


:If its only one or two I tend to simply use &quot;(optional)&quot; but for more than that I add a line break and start a ne w list marked optional directly below the first list. While it is useful to have multiple lists they should all be together for clarity. If you're reading a recipe to confirm which ingredients you'll need you need to have them all together so that you don't accidentally miss one. Introducing ingrediants into the text of a recipe that aren't invited in the main Ingredients section is a major pet peeve for me. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]] 23:43, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== people put recipes in the template! ==

Twice now, people have put recipes ''into'' the template. Perhaps they ought to be saved elsewhere:

For the future though... how shall we clue people in?

Hello, on the Dutch wikibooks, we've created a new skin for the template:
*One for recipes with picture: [[nl:Sjabloon:Receptmetafbeelding]], [[nl:Kookboek:Berchemse_boterkoekjes|example]]
*One for recipes without picture: [[nl:Sjabloon:Recept]], [[nl:Kookboek:Arretjescake|example]].&lt;br /&gt;

==Recipes In Progress==
Given the open source spirit of &quot;release early, release often&quot;, I think that the cookbook would benefit from a template indicating that a recipe is a &quot;Recipe In Progress&quot; (RIP). This would indicate that a given article contains a recipe being created or adapted and should be discussed for possible improvements on the talk page. This way, original recipes that need to be further developed or new recipes that need to be tweaked can be clearly marked as such. Hopefully, this will lead to some testing by the community and at the end, a solid recipe will emerge. It might also be helpful if the template indicates that the recipe should be used at a reader's own risk. [[User:Yonkeltron|Yonkeltron]] 13:03, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

== Serves ?? ==

may be each recipe should show how many people it serves
and if its a side serving or full meal

And Perhaps a Variants list for the base article
for eg for Macaroni and Cheese there's an article called Macaroni and Cheese
and with in that page is a list of the different Variants of the recipe and a short Description:
Over Baked: Cooked In the oven for Great Taste takes 1 hour
Simple: Super quick Takes 10 minutes
Stove Top: cook in a pot takes 20-25 minutes

== Weight &amp; Volume ==

The recipe template recommends use of volumes rather than weights on the grounds that many kitchens do not have scales. In Europe most kitchens do have scales, and a cheap kitchen scale need cost only a few dollars - high accuracy is not necessary.

Outside North America it is far less common to perceive a &quot;cup&quot; as a known volume (8 fl.oz.) and rather to see it as &quot;whatever cup I have close to hand&quot; which may vary by more than 5:2. Furthermore the physical state of an ingredient can cause its density to vary by 3:2 or even more - a cup of white flour can easily be as little as 100 gm or as much as 150 gm. For consistency and repeatability of recipes it is far better to use weight for solid ingredients and volume only for liquids.

I have not found a volume/weight conversion table for different ingredients - is there one?

== Shouldn't be classified as a recipe ==

This page is classified as a recipe, which it should not be. —[[User:Kri|Kri]] ([[User talk:Kri|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kri|contribs]]) 13:09, 16 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The great Re-edit of 2008 ==
It has been reorganized and re-edited in Nov 2008 to better meet the content and organization that the college board has defined for a course in AP U.S. History. The content of the book was carefully chosen for NPOV, significance and interest. We are very interested in the success of the book and any feedback and improvments would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward towards any and all discussion on the content and organization of the book, which we (Geoff Plourde) feel needs to be as close to the college board listed topics as possible.--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 15:48, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

==ARCHIVE==
(such significant changes to the organization that the following comments may no longer be relevant)

some one can change the rev. box to only one purple box its not 50% yet
and the pdf is out of date

I agree that the chapters are a little short, but I think I can help to expand many of them, especially if this is going to be based off of the AP US History course--I have the 11th and 12th editions of '''The American Pageant''', a rather widely used textbook on the subject of AP US History--what are the legal restraints on using that textbook as a reference for the creation of this wikibook? --[[user:Mance|Mance]]

----

http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/ushistory/ap_cd_ushistory.pdf contains a course description that runs to 33 &quot;chapters&quot; of topics.  As this text book is going to be, at least initially, based on the College Board's Advanced Placement course, perhaps it should reasonably closely follow the course outline's topics.  Since the the contents of this book ends at 1960 but the course outline goes up to today, I have added a few suggested chapters for others to expand on.

I don't think that the title of Chapter 26, ''Another Bush, September 11, Iraq again, and Terror (2001-2004)''; it seems somewhat pejorative.  It somewhat diminishes Bush (43) as the continuation of the Bush (41), and his presidency (43's) is very different from his father's.  Iraq ''again'', also seems POV.  (Emphasis added, b/c that's how I think most people will read it.)  That said, the rest of the outline seems great.  I look forward to contributing to this wikibook.--[[User:Mcornelius|Mcornelius]] 00:38, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== chapter titles ==

It seems as if I've heard the chapter titles from another source.  Are they original?--[[User:64.254.129.161|64.254.129.161]] 06:13, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::Absolutely!  in keeping with the required topics of the College board I'm trying to keep the discussion limited to content normally covered in the AP history test.  the content might be 'spiced up' but lets keep the organization ruthlessly specific to there requirements, no matter how interesting or uninteresting you think it might be for the text book.  --[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 16:06, 5 November 2008 (UTC)

== an observation.... ==

Is it just me, or are these chapters a little on the short side? If this is intended to be used for AP History, the chapters need to have quite a bit more detail. I don't mean to diminish all the work that has been done so far, but for this book to compete with commercial college textbooks it has to go into the same depth of detail.

== Room for Improvement? == 
In the spirit of contstructive criticism I offer the following.

I was surfing through this section and delved into the subsection on the U.S. Civil War. My comments would be that the articles are rather &quot;thin&quot; and make little use of existing articles in Wikipedia.

I'll contribute when I can, but thought that I would point out that it might be possible to save much writing and rewriting by referencing already extant articles. I'll be adding links as I notice them to Wikipedia and other sources as I think that hypertexting is one of the more efficient ways of developing such a project.

I'd also suggest that if this is to serve as a functional textbook there should be certain additions:

* Tests (even for the casual reader, a self test at the tend of the section is a useful tool to verify comprehension)
* Bibliographies and/or a &quot;Recommended Reading&quot;.
* This suggestion is a bit farther out, if sites don't exist for opinions and exploring &quot;What If?&quot; (every historian's favorite game) some facility should be developed to that end. Nothing encourages comprehension of history better than considering the possibilities if things had gone differently.
* Some determination for a target age group, unless we're settled on the first listed recommended test subjects.

For my part, where and when I can, I will be adding and working on some of these sections. My intent unless I hear otherwise will be to copyedit for the most part and to not duplicate what could be found in the articles and sites linked to from the pages.

[[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 18:28, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
:Linking may help, but this wouldn't be a book if it was a big list of links. You should, in my opinion, be able to print this out and use it like a textbook (for the most part).Also, &quot;What ifs&quot; can be highly debatable, and they aren't really history. If used, they should be limited  [[User:Ericruud|Ericruud]] 03:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)


It is a &quot;text book&quot; which are not suppose to go into great detail.  What my be helpful hyperlinks to wiki pages that would go into greater detail.

== Blue words in the PDF ==
Since the PDF book is directly copied and pasted from the text here, some of the words in the PDF appear blue as if they would still be linked to something, and the compiler of the PDF hasn't bothered to unlink them, it seems. Please someone unlink the words that appear blue in the PDF, they serve no purpose and are a distraction. --[[User:84.239.157.217|84.239.157.217]] 14:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

== Adding Questions ==

If no one objects, I can add several review questions at the end of each chapter to reinforce the material (as suggested by &quot;erraunt&quot; in October of last year). Not too many, maybe somewhere between three to six, maybe seven. Note that this will only apply to &quot;completed chapters&quot;.

Why are there three chapters on secession and the Confederacy (&quot;States' Rights&quot;, &quot;Intro to Secession&quot;, &quot;Farewell to the Star Spangled Banner&quot;)? Shouldn't we just consolidate them into one chapter? Or add them into &quot;The Civil War&quot;?

--[[User:Ccny930|Ccny930]] 23:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:The Civil War chapter itself is too long, so consolidation of all four would result in quite a load for quite a few browsers. I have merged (with [[User:Webaware]]'s help) the &quot;Intro&quot; and &quot;Farewell&quot; chapters.

==Failures of traditional histories==
After briefly reading through a few portions of this Wikibook, I've come to fear that it may repeat some of the failures of traditional histories. That is, it seems to favor the same sectors of society that the average high school textbook does. I would highly recommend that the editors of this book check out Howard Zinn's ''[[w:A People's History of the United States|A People's History of the United States]]'', which will provide a lot of facts that will help this book rise above the mediocrity of standard issue history textbooks. If this is going to be a truly unbiased book, then it's going to have to cover not only presidents and their history, but also the histories of black people, Native Americans, women, laborers, radicals, and other people usually ignored by traditional histories. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 06:26, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

Impacts of Spanish conquistadors on North and South America, colonialization of and displacement of First Nations peoples, the casting aside of treaties and the exploitation of resources on remaining tribal lands, impacts from new livestock including horses and cattle, disruption of traditional diets, impacts of disease and genocide -- all these should be discussed in much more depth.  We should be particularly interested in the transition from a &quot;solar economy&quot; to subsequent ones based on mining groundwater and oil to produce an ever-dwindling variety of less nutritive crops, for instance.

== The Great(er) Re-edit of 2009 ==

Hello, all!

As you can see, I have yet to sign up.  I have been cordially invited to, and likely will.  Problem is, I am a horrible procrastinator. :)

In the re-edit, I am working on a massive overhaul and reorganization to make the book flow more coherantly and fill it with content more complete.  Don't get me wrong, some sections are more complete than others, and my main intent is to fill the void as necessary.  The more complete sections (such as the Civil War, save for a few specific major battles) will stay pretty much as they are, of course.

== Anyone want to give me an orientation? ==
I'm starting work on a separate U.S. History textbook project for a nonprofit working on Open Educational Resources. The philosophy is slightly different, with each chapter consisting of a collection of primary and secondary documents--so it's not really duplicating your work. I was thinking of using some of the text from your book (or Wikipedia articles) as secondary sources.  It would (in theory) provide some contextualizing, synthetic elements that the primary sources lack, but also be held up not as an infallible source, but as one of many possible accounts, which students would be invited to read critically. Anyway, I'd be interested to talk with someone who knows this project well and can tell me about which parts are going to be developed enough for that kind of use, or whether I should just go to the Wikipedia article. FWIW, I'm a doctoral student in education at Stanford, working on this project for http://www.ck12.org, and know my way around the wiki world fairly well, but not WikiBooks in particular. Please reply to me here or drop me a message, if you'd be up for a phone call. Thanks. --[[User:Rmlucas|Rmlucas]] ([[User talk:Rmlucas|talk]]) 05:13, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

New Sweden should be included in the colonial section.

== Organization ==

Hey, I've noticed that there have been sections on education, women's history, and demographics added to some chapters, in many cases being integrated poorly.  I also noticed that we have an orphaned article dealing with native American tribes, and very little coverage on the Industrial Revolution prior to the American Civil War.  Therefore, I propose the following topical histories, each to be listed in a separate section of the table of contents entitled &quot;Topical histories&quot;:

*[[US History/Women's History]]
*[[US History/History of Education in America]]
*[[US History/Demographic History]]

== Flow, two ==

There are problems with the big, complicated subject of American History being organized into a Wikibook. There is no current way of seeing subheadings within chapters. You cannot tell, for example, from looking at a chapter in the table of contents that it has a certain important development within it (e.g., public education, a Supreme Court decision, an advocate for a disadvantaged minority). What is more, there is no current way of linking subheadings within chapters. You could not see, for example, that the continual expansion of technology is a continuing theme in our history. More simply, you cannot see that an account of one presidential election occurs *twice* in succeeding chapters, creating redundancy &amp; confusion. This seems to negate an important advantage of the Internet, though paper books also have ways of indicating these themes. 

I am looking at other Wikibooks to see how they have solved these problems. What works? I could use advice. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 11:44, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

== A personal bugbear: &quot;this resulted&quot; ==

No matter what one's view of history -- &quot;Great Man&quot; theory, economic forces, or movement causation -- try to show how one action affects another. There are too many phrases like &quot;this resulted,&quot; with nothing showing *how* something grew from something else. What is the relationship between the Second Great Revival and the Temperance crusade? If one is quoting a source (as I do too seldom), try to show the relationship in the quote.

== Applications of Special Relativity ==

In this chapter we continue the study of special relativity by applying the ideas developed in the previous chapter to the study of waves. 

First, we shall show how to describe waves in the context of spacetime. We then see how waves which have no preferred reference frame (such as that of a medium supporting them) are constrained by special relativity to have a dispersion relation of a particular form. This dispersion relation turns out to be that of the relativistic matter waves of quantum mechanics. 

Second, we shall investigate the Doppler shift phenomenon, in which the frequency of a wave takes on different values in different coordinate systems. 

Third, we shall show how to add velocities in a relativistically consistent manner. This will also prove useful when we come to discuss particle behaviour in special relativity.

A new mathematical idea will be presented in the context of relativistic waves, namely the spacetime vector or four-vector. Writing the laws of physics totally in terms of relativistic scalars and four-vectors ensures that they will be valid in all inertial reference frames.

=== Waves in Spacetime ===

Waves in Spacetime

We now look at the characteristics of waves in spacetime. Recall that a wave in one space dimension can be represented by

&lt;math&gt;A(x,t) = A_0 \sin(kx- \omega t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt; is the (constant) amplitude of the wave, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the wavenumber, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency, and that the quantity &lt;math&gt;\phi = kx - \omega t&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;i&gt;phase&lt;/i&gt; of the wave. For a wave in three space dimensions, the wave is represented in a similar way,

&lt;math&gt;A(\mathbf{x},t) = A_0 \sin(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}- \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;	

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is now the position vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave vector. The magnitude of the wave vector, &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{k}| = k&lt;/math&gt; is just the wavenumber of the wave and the direction of this vector indicates the direction the wave is moving. The phase of the wave in this case is &lt;math&gt;\phi = \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x} - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Introductory_Physics_fig_5.1.png|Figure 5.1: Sketch of wave fronts for a wave in spacetime.]]&lt;br&gt;'''Figure 5.1''': Sketch of wave fronts for a wave in spacetime. The large arrow is the associated wave four-vector, which has slope &lt;math&gt;\omega /ck&lt;/math&gt;. The slope of the wave fronts is the inverse, &lt;math&gt;ck/ \omega&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

In the one-dimensional case &lt;math&gt;\phi = kx - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;. A wave front has constant phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, so solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and multiplying by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, the speed of light in a vacuum, gives us an equation for the world line of a wave front: 

&lt;math&gt;ct = \frac{ckx}{\omega}-\frac{c\phi}{\omega}=\frac{ck}{u_p}-\frac{c\phi}{\omega} \quad \mbox{(wave front).}&lt;/math&gt;

The slope of the world line in a spacetime diagram is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;c/u_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_p = \omega/k&lt;/math&gt; is the phase speed.

==Pronunciation drill 2-1. Hoe heet u?==
{{Dutch/Exercise|Your turn to say something
|
The little sentence &quot;Hoe heet u?&quot; literally means: ''What are you called?'' and is usually translated as: ''What's your name?''. It presents some serious pronunciation problems particularly for American speakers, because it contains three unfamiliar sounds. There are two difficult vowels, the [u] of &quot;hoe&quot; and the [y] of &quot;u&quot;. They are hard because the American &quot;u&quot; is much less rounded than either and also more or less intermediary between the two in tongue position. 
:'''Lips''': Both Dutch vowels are ''strongly rounded'', the lips are held as in blowing a kiss. 
:'''Tongue''': For the [y] the tongue is pushed forward to produced a little cup just behind the teeth, for the [u] it is pulled back to form a cup in the throat area.

In addition the Dutch &quot;h&quot; is a bit different, because it is generally ''voiced'' [ɦ]

Listen to the recording and try to reproduce the sounds:
*{{audio|Nl-Dutch-hoeheetu-drill.ogg|Hoe heet u?}}

|
:If you are French, Turkish or German the two vowels [u]/[y] are a piece of cake, but not the [ɦ].
:If you are Hispanic, Italian or Russian the [u] is easy, but not [y] and [ɦ].
:If you speak Arabic only the [y] should be a problem.

Depending on your background you may have to revisit this to get your ears, lips and tongue used to it all.

==Grammatica 2-1 ~ Introduction to Verbs==
A '''[[Wikipedia:en:Verb|verb]]''' (in Dutch: ''werkwoord'') is that part of speech that describes an action. Verbs come in an almost bewildering array of tenses, moods, voices and aspects, and there are several major types: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and ergative verbs.  

Fortunately, the Dutch verb is not too different from the English one, although it does have a few more forms.

  I &lt;u&gt;am called&lt;/u&gt; Standish                      ''Ik &lt;u&gt;heet&lt;/u&gt; Standish'' 
  What &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; you &lt;u&gt;called&lt;/u&gt; (named)?              ''Hoe &lt;u&gt;heet&lt;/u&gt; u?'' 
  ...that she &lt;u&gt;is named (called)&lt;/u&gt; 'Alice'     ''...dat ze 'Alice' &lt;u&gt;heet&lt;/u&gt;''
  We &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; both &lt;u&gt;called&lt;/u&gt; Robert                 ''Wij &lt;u&gt;heten&lt;/u&gt; allebei Robert''

|colspan=&quot;4&quot;|In the clips for heten and geloven the past tense and the past participle are also given.&lt;br/&gt;It is customary to memorize those three primitive forms of the verb, but we will deal with that later.
|}

The Dutch verb ''heten'' can best be translated as &quot;to be named&quot; or &quot;to be called&quot; and we see two forms of it here
# a singular one: ''heet'' used with ''ik'',''u'',''ze'' 
# a plural one ''heten'' used for ''wij'' (as well the other plural persons).
Actually there are usually three forms. This can be seen from:

{|
|-
|I believe||Ik geloof
|-
|do you believe?||geloof'''t''' u?
|-
|to believe||geloven
|}
  
In the case of ''heten'' the extra '''''-t''''' does not get added because the stem already ends in a ''-t''.

In a [[Dutch/Lesson 5|later lesson]] we will revisit the verb forms associated with each person.

The irregular verb ''to be''-''zijn'' has a few more forms in both languages.

Of course memorizing words and expressions is an important part of learning any language and there are various ways of doing that. Have a look at the [[Dutch/Vocabulary|vocabulary]] pages. They are designed to help you acquire more words in a playful manner.

==Grammatica 2-2 ~ Inversion in questions and negations==

You may have wondered about the order of the words in

: ik geloof dat ze Alice '''''heet'''''.

Even though Dutch verbs are not so much more complicated than English ones, word order is. In fact it is quite a bit more complicated than in English. For the moment let's just leave the above sentence for what it is and start with questions.

===Questions===

A question sentence in Dutch simply '''''reverses''''' the order of subject and verb. 

Recall: ''&lt;font color=blue&gt;U&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;heet&lt;/font&gt; meneer Standish'' ('You are named Mr. Standish). 

It became: ''Hoe &lt;font color=green&gt;heet&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;u&lt;/font&gt;?'' as a question

The normal word order of &lt;font color=blue&gt;subject (''u'' or &quot;you&quot;)&lt;/font&gt; then &lt;font color=green&gt;verb (''heten'')&lt;/font&gt; is ''reversed'' and, in this case, an interrogative (''hoe'' or &quot;how&quot;) added. 

Additional examples:
{|
|-
| ''Hoe &lt;font color=green&gt;gaat&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;het&lt;/font&gt; met u?'' ||↔|| ''&lt;font color=blue&gt;Het&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;gaat&lt;/font&gt; goed met u''  
|-
| ''&lt;font color=green&gt;Bent&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;u&lt;/font&gt; mevrouw Koopman?''||↔|| ''&lt;font color=blue&gt;U&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;bent&lt;/font&gt; mevrouw Koopman'' 
|-
| ''&lt;font color=green&gt;Bent&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;u&lt;/font&gt; Nederlander?'' ||↔|| ''&lt;font color=blue&gt;U&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;bent&lt;/font&gt; Nederlander'' (&quot;You are Dutch&quot;).
|-
| ''&lt;font color=green&gt;Verstaat&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;u&lt;/font&gt; mij?''||↔||''&lt;font color=blue&gt;U&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;verstaat&lt;/font&gt; mij'' (&quot;You understand me&quot;).
|-
| ''&lt;font color=green&gt;Gelooft &lt;font color=blue&gt;u&lt;/font&gt;?''||↔|| ''&lt;font color=blue&gt;Ik&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;geloof''
|-
|[[Image:Nl-Dutch-grammatica-2-2.ogg|40px|noicon]]
|}
English does the same thing when using the verb ''to be'':

: I am - are you?
: ik ben - bent u?

Dutch does '''''not''''' use the auxiliary ''to do'' as English requires in most other cases:

: ik weet  -  weet u?
: I know   -  do you know? (instead of &quot;know you?&quot;)

===Negations===

The negative is formed by simply adding ''niet'' at the end:

:Ik versta u       -  I understand you
:Ik versta u niet  -  I do not understand you

Again, Dutch does ''not'' use the auxiliary ''to do''. (In fact using it sounds very foreign.)

Even a negative question does not use ''to do'':

:Verstaat u mij niet? - Don't you understand me?

{{Dutch/Exercise|questions and negations
|
Turn the following statements into questions and translate:
# U gelooft de man niet 
# De man ziet een vrouw
# U verstaat Nederlands
# Het meisje daar is Anne
# U hoort beneden mensen 
|
#Gelooft u de man niet? - Don't you believe the man?
#Ziet de man de vrouw? - Does the man see the woman?
#Verstaat u Nederlands? - Do you understand Dutch?
# Is het meisje daar Anne? - Is the girl there Anne?
# Hoort U beneden mensen? - Do you hear people downstairs?
}}

==Grammatica 2-2 Adjectives, demonstratives and articles==
===Gender===
Where English uses the '''demonstrative pronoun''' ''that'', Dutch uses either ''dat'' or ''die'', recall:

:''dat'' nieuwe meisje. ''Die'' brunette. - ''that'' new girl, ''that'' brunette

Similarly, where English uses the '''article''' ''the'', Dutch has two possibilities: ''de'' or ''het'', recall:

:''de'' boekhouding, ''het'' meisje. - ''the'' administration, ''the'' girl

We will revisit this phenomenon (gender) in the next lesson more extensively. There is a bit of a problem with it in Dutch.

For the moment it is enough to realize that there are two kinds of words, 
:ones that take ''de'' and ''die''
:ones that take ''het'' and ''dat''

For this reason it is advisable to always memorize a word ''together'' with its definite article, e.g. as &quot;de boekhouding&quot;, not simply as &quot;boekhouding&quot;.


Both articles and demonstrative pronouns are a special kind of '''adjectives''': words that are added to make the meaning of another word more precise, like ''new'', ''small'' or ''exciting''

{{Dutch/Exercise|die en dat
|
Replace the articles by the correct demonstratives ''die'' or ''dat'' and translate (might have to guess a bit):
# Het huis  (house) is van het nieuwe meisje
# De huizen zijn erg groot.
# De boekhouding is niet in orde
# De brunette heeft lang haar.
# Ik weet het telefoonnummer niet.
# Weet jij wie de vrouw is?
|
# Dat huis is van dat nieuwe meisje - That house belongs to that new girl
# Die huizen zijn erg groot. - Those houses are very big
# Die boekhouding is niet in orde - The administration is not in order
# Die brunette heeft lang haar. - That brunette has long hair
# Ik weet dat telefoonnummer niet. - I do not know that telephone number
# Weet jij wie die vrouw is? Do you know who that woman is?
}}

===Inflection===
Recall that some adjectives in the dialogue ended in '''''-e''''' (mooi''e'' meid), sometimes they did  not (is erg mooi).

Adjectives can be used in two ways: in front of a noun and after a verb like ''is'' (a copula).  In English the adjective remains the same regardless:

:The house is '''red''' (copula + adjective)
:The '''red''' car (adjective + noun)

Behind a copula (as ''predicate'') this is true in Dutch as well:

:Ik ben gek (I am crazy)
:Ze is mooi (She is pretty)
:De auto is rood (The car is red)

But in Dutch they are ''inflected'' if they occur in front of a noun (as ''attribute''). Compare:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot;
|-
|[[Dutch/Vocabulary/Colours|practice your colors]]
|}
:de rode auto - the red car
:een rode auto - a red car
:de rode auto's - the red cars
:rode auto's  - red cars

Neuter words are the ones that carry the definite article ''het'' and the demonstrative ''dat''. They are a bit different (Again: we will revisit them in the next lesson.)

:het rode huis
:een '''rood''' huis - a red house
:de rode huizen
:rode huizen

As you see the adjective is not inflected after the indefinite article ''een''.

This also holds if there is no article:

:met groot gemak - with great ease (het gemak: neuter)

'''But''':

:in hoge nood - in desparate need (de nood)

Thus, apart from the indefinite neuter an attributive adjective is usually inflected with '''''-e'''''.

There are a few exceptions, compare e.g.:

:de man - the man
:een grote man  - a big man
:een groot man - a great man

{{Dutch/Exercise|inflection
|
Put the adjectives in parentheses in the correct form
# Dit is een (groot) boekhouding
# Deze haren zijn (lang)
# Dit (groot) huis is (hoog)
# Weet jij wie die (mooi) auto heeft?
# Dit is een (klein) meisje
|
# Dit is een grote boekhouding
# Deze haren zijn lang
# Dit grote huis is hoog
# Weet jij wie die mooie auto heeft?
# Dit is een klein meisje
}}

===Making nouns out of adjectives===
Adjectives can be turned into nouns, by assuming their inflected form:

:Dat is een grote  
::That is a big one
:Dat is een kleine
::That is a small one
:Die lange heeft mijn fiets gestolen
::That tall guy has stolen my bike

Notice that Dutch does not use 'one' in such cases.

There are a number of adjectives that can be turned into nouns by adding '''''-te'''''.  They all carry '''de'''. In English the corresponding suffix is '''''-th''''':

:wijd – wijdte (wide - width)
:lang – lengte (long, tall - length)
:groot – grootte (big - size)
:breed – breedte (broad - breadth) 
:eng – engte (narrow - narrowness)
:zwaar – zwaarte (heavy - heaviness)
:heet – hitte (hot - heat)
:warm – warmte (warm - warmth)
:zwak – zwakte (weak - weakness)
:sterk – sterkte (strong - strength)
:droog – droogte (dry - drought)
:hoog – hoogte (high - height)
:menig – menigte (many - crowd)
:duur – duurte (expensive - dearth) &lt;!-- en ja dat woord bestaat echt in het Engels) --&gt;
:gewoon – gewoonte (usual - habit)

More about nouns in the next lesson.

Hansm - I like the conversation you developed. It should replace the difficult one I had in Lesson 1 (1-2). Otherwise, the lesson material is similar to the existing, with the exception of discussing verbs.  That can be started here, but I was holding off because so much material (vocab, pronouns, wortd order) needs inclusion.  I can try putting the verb intro up front, or just delay one lesson (to your 0.2 for example) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:26, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Marsh - what I have done here was just to show up my ideas. Yes, you are right, there is much more to be explained as I thought on the first view. Anyway, I think verb forms are more important than polite and familar forms, aytually, this are special verb forms. Integrate it in your lesson as you like. I know, it's not easy at all. Btw, you see, my English always needs corrections and my grammatical knowlage about German is more intuition than knowing, althought I'm quite sure about it. But It's realy hard for me to give grammatical rules since I don't need them myself. -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 19:30, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Almost all books like this one have a section on (or very similar to) &quot;why you should use the shell/program flavor/language/etc. discussed in this book and not any of the others that perform the same tasks in a slightly different way&quot;. It seems to be pretty well mandatory.

However, this book will not do that. We'll talk a bit about &quot;why Bourne Shell&quot; of course. But you'll soon see that doesn't preclude other shells at all. And there's no good reason not to use another shell either, as we will explain a little further down.

==Bourne shell and other Unix command shells==

There are many Unix command shells available today. Bourne Shell is just one drop in a very large ocean. How do all these shells relate? Do they do the same things? Is one better than the other? Let's take a look at what makes a shell and what that means for all the different shells out there.

===How it all got started...===

The Unix operating system has had a unique outlook on the world ever since it was created back in the 1970s. It stands apart from most other operating systems in that its focus has always been towards ''power users'': people who want to squeeze every drop of performance out of their system and have the technical knowledge to do so. Unix was designed to be programmed and modified to the desires of the user. At its core, Unix does not have a user interface; instead it is comprised of a stable OS kernel and a versatile C library. If you're not trying to do actual hard-core programming but rather are trying to do day-to-day tasks (or even just want to put a little program together quickly), pure Unix is a tremendous pain in the backside.

In other words, it was clear from the start that a tool would be needed that would allow a user to make use of the functions offered him by the coding library and kernel without actually doing serious programming work. A tool in other words that could pass small commands on to the lower-level system quickly and easily. Without the need for a compiler or other fancy editor, but with the ability to tap into the enormous power of the underlying system. Stephen Bourne set himself to the task and came up with what he called a ''shell'': a small, on-the-fly compiler that could take one command at a time, translate it into the sequence of bits understood by the machine and have that command carried out. We now call this type of program an [[wiktionary:interpreter|interpreter]], but at the time, the term &quot;shell&quot; was much more common (since it was a shell over the underlying system for the user). Stephen's shell was slim, fast, and though a bit unwieldy at times, its power is still the envy of many current operating system command-line interfaces today. Since it was designed by Stephen Bourne, this shell is called the Bourne Shell. The executable is simply called ''sh'' and use of this shell in scripting is still so ubiquitous, there isn't a Unix-based system on this earth that doesn't offer a shell whose executable can be reached under the name sh.

===...And how it ended up===

Of course, everyone's a critic. The Bourne Shell saw tremendous use (indeed, it still does) and as a result, it became the de facto standard among Unix shells. But all sorts of people almost immediately (as well as with use) wanted new features in the shell, or a more familiar way of expressing commands, or something else. Many people built new shells that they felt continued where Bourne Shell ended. Some were completely compatible with Bourne Shell, others were less so. Some became famous, others flopped. But pretty much all of them look fondly upon Bourne Shell, the shell they call &quot;Dad...&quot;

A number of these shells can be run in sh-like mode, to more closely emulate that very first sh, though most people tend just to run their shells in the default mode, which provides more power than the minimum sh.

===It's Bourne Shell, but not as we know it....===

So there are a lot of shells around but you can find Bourne Shell everywhere, right? Good old ''sh'', just sitting there faithfully until the end of time....

Well, no, not really. Most of the sh exectuables out there nowadays aren't really the Bourne Shell anymore. Through a bit of Unix magic called a link (which allows one file to masquerade as another) the sh executable you find on any Unix system is likely actually to be one of the shells that is based on the Bourne shell. One of the most frequently used shells nowadays (with the ascent of free and open-source operating systems like GNU and Linux) is a heavily extended form of the Bourne Shell produced by the Free Software Foundation, called [[w:Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]. Bash hasn't forgotten its roots, though: it stands for the '''B'''ourne '''A'''gain '''SH'''ell.

Another example of a descendant shell standing in for its ancestor is the Korn Shell (ksh). Also an extension shell, it is completely compatible with sh -- it simply adds some features. Much the same is true for zsh.

Finally, a slightly different category is formed by the C Shell (csh) and its descendant tcsh, native on BSD systems. These shells do break compatibility to some extent, using different syntax for many commands. Systems that use these shells as standard shells often provide a real Bourne Shell executable to run generic Bourne Shell scripts.

Having read the above, you will understand why this book doesn't have to convince you to use Bourne Shell instead of any other shell: in most cases, there's no noticeable difference. Bourne Shell and its legacy have become so ingrained in the heart and soul of the Unix environment that you are using Bourne Shell when you are using practically any shell available to you.

==Why Bourne Shell== 

So only one real question remains: now that you find yourself on your own, cozy slice of a Unix system, with your own shell and all its capabilities, is there any real reason to use Bourne Shell rather than using the whole range of your shell's capabilities?

Well, it depends. Probably, there isn't. For the most part of course, you ''are'' using Bourne Shell by using the whole potential of your shell -- your shell is probably ''that'' similar to the Bourne Shell. But there is one thing you might want to keep in mind: someday, you might want to write a script that you might want to pass around to other people. Of course you can write your script using the full range of options that your shell offers you; but then it might not work on another machine with another shell. This is where the role of Bourne Shell as the Latin of Unix command shells comes in -- and also where it is useful to know how to write scripts targeted specifically at the Bourne Shell. If you write your scripts for the Bourne Shell and nothing but the Bourne Shell, chances are far better than equal that your script will run straight out of the mail attachment (don't tell me you're still using boxes to ship things -- come on, get with the program) on any command shell out there.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lektion Eins für Fortgeschrittene&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Geschichte 1-3 ~ ''Markus studiert'' ==
:&lt;big&gt;Markus ist in der Universität. Er trinkt dort einen Kaffee und isst ein Brötchen. Danach geht er in die Bibliothek. Er sucht ein Buch über Biochemie. Er holt das Buch aus dem Regal und setzt sich an einen Tisch. Nach einer Stunde geht er in den Hof und raucht eine Zigarette. Danach geht er an den Tisch zurück. Er denkt: &quot;Wenigstens eine Stunde...&quot; und stellt das Buch wieder in das Regal.&lt;/big&gt;

This short story (''Geschichte'') is told in the 3rd person (see Grammatik 1-3). Note how this is apparent from both the pronoun (''Er'' or &quot;he&quot;) and verb forms.

== Grammatik 1-3 ~ Personal Pronouns ==
As in English, '''personal pronouns''' exist in three grammatical persons, each with singular and plural number. In Gespräch 1-1 and 1-2, you see only the singular versions. The table here gives also the plural (nominative case only):
&lt;ul&gt;

{|
|-
| '''''ich''''' || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I 
| &amp;nbsp; ||    &amp;ndash; 1st person, singular
|-
| '''''du''''' ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; you 
|
 ||  &amp;ndash; 2nd person, singular 
|-
| '''''er''''' ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; he 
|
| &amp;ndash; 3rd person musculine, singular
|-
| '''''sie''''' ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; she 
|
| &amp;ndash; 3rd person feminine, singular 
|-
| '''''es'''''&lt;p&gt; ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; it&lt;p&gt;
|
| &amp;ndash; 3rd person neuter, singular&lt;p&gt;
|-
| '''''wir''''' ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; we 
|
 ||  &amp;ndash; 1st person, plural 
|-
| '''''ihr''''' ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; you 
|
 ||  &amp;ndash; 2nd person, plural 
|-
| '''''sie''''' ||  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; they 
|
 ||  &amp;ndash; 3rd person, plural 
|-
| '''''Sie'''''
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; you ('''formal''') 
|
| &amp;ndash; 2nd person, plural and singular, always declined plural 
|}
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Grammatik 1-3 ~ Incomplete Sentences ==
What are we to make of short, incomplete sentences such as that in Gespräch 1-1: 'Und dir?'?  This translates as: 'And for you?'.  In English and German it is not always necessary to express every part of a sentence, especially in conversation where the words left out are easily understood by both or all parties.  Walk up to a stranger and say 'And you?' and a possible response is a hostile 'Out of my face, fool'.  But in the conversation between Heinrich and Karl, Heinrich knows that Karl is really meaning: ''Und &lt;u&gt;wie geht es&lt;/u&gt; dir?'', with that part underlined left out of the conversational statement.  Note especially that the pronoun 'you' retains its case&amp;mdash;its relation to the missing verb from the implied sentence&amp;mdash;distinctive in German (that is, ''dir'' instead of ''du'') but not so in English (the form &quot;you&quot; covers both cases).
----

== &lt;font color=&quot;SaddleBrown&quot;&gt;Übersetzung 1-2&lt;/font&gt; ==
Although these sentences involve many grammatical concepts that have not been covered, each can be written in German by referring to the example sentences and vocabularies in Lessons 1 and  1A.  Using a piece of paper and pencil, translate each of these sentences into German:
# Hello Mark! Do you have a cigarette?
# Are you studying German?
# Catherine drinks coffee at a table.
# The students study at the library.
# He eats cheese and sausage in the courtyard.
# She looks for a book about biology.
# Mark goes back to the University.
# Mark removes the book from the shelf and places it on the table.
