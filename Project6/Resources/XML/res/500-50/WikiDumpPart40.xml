== Basic Coding ==

It turns out that we can actually improve the performance of our system simply by changing the bits in our system. We can change the order of bits, or we can change the number of bits that we send, to help decrease error rates. This chapter will talk about transmission codes that can help increase system performance. 

== Gray Codes ==

Let us look at a basic QASK system:

#&quot;00&quot; = +5V
#&quot;01&quot; = +1.66V
#&quot;10&quot; = -1.66V
#&quot;11&quot; = -5V

We will call these &quot;symbol 1&quot; (for 00), &quot;symbol 2&quot; (for 01), &quot;symbol 3&quot; (for 10) and &quot;symbol 4&quot; (for 11).

Now, let us make a basic assumption that the only errors we get will be errors between adjacent symbols. For instance, Symbol 1 can be mistaken for symbol 2, but symbol 1 can never be mistaken for symbol 3. In reality, there is always a very small chance that this could happen, but we will simply ignore it for our purposes.

Now, we have 6 error conditions:

#Symbol 1 looks like Symbol 2
#Symbol 2 looks like Symbol 1
#Symbol 2 looks like Symbol 3
#Symbol 3 looks like Symbol 2
#Symbol 3 looks like Symbol 4
#Symbol 4 looks like Symbol 3

We can also see that in error conditions 1, 2, 5, and 6, a symbol error only produces 1 bit error. The other bit is actually not transmitted in error. The only time where we see 2 bits transmitted in error is when there is a mixup between symbols 2 and 3. We can calculate our probability of bit error as such:

&lt;math&gt;P_\mbox{bit error} = \frac{4}{6}(1) P_\mbox{one bit error} + \frac{2}{6}(2)P_\mbox{two bits error}&lt;/math&gt;

P&lt;sub&gt;one bit error&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that 1 bit from the symbol will be in error. P&lt;sub&gt;two bits error&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that both symbols will be received in error.

To alleviate this problem, we can reorder our symbols, and map them the following way:

#&quot;00&quot; = +5V
#&quot;01&quot; = +1.66V
#&quot;11&quot; = -1.66V
#&quot;10&quot; = -5V

Now, when any symbol is received in error, there is only one bit error. This small trick is called &quot;Gray Coding&quot;, and is a useful (but simple) method to improve system performance in terms of net bit errors.

=== Using Gray Codes ===

Gray codes are a simple example of how using an encoding/decoding mechanism in a communications system can have an effect on the error rate of the system. In future chapters we will discuss error correction codes (ECC) that can be used to find and fix single-bit errors in a signal. If we use Gray codes to ensure that the majority of errors are single-bit errors, we can then use more advanced ECC codes to resolve these errors.

Gray codes are typically not used on their own, but are combined with more robust coding methods, like described above.

== Line Codes ==
{{wikipedia|line code}}

In addition to pulse shaping, there are a number of useful '''line codes''' that we can use to help reduce our errors or to have other positive effects on our signal.

Line coding consists of representing the digital signal to be transported, by an amplitude- and time-discrete signal, that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital signal on a transmission link is called line encoding. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar and Manchester encoding.

Line codes are used commonly in computer communication networks over short distances.

There are numerous ways digital information can be coded onto a transmission medium. Some of the more common include:

::[[Image:line code table.gif]]



::[[Image:line code drawing.gif]]

Each of the various line formats has a particular advantage and disadvantage. It is not possible to select one, which will meet all needs. The format may be selected to meet one or more of the following criteria:

::• Minimize transmission hardware
::• Facilitate synchronization
::• Ease error detection and correction
::• Minimize spectral content
::• Eliminate a dc component

The Manchester code is quite popular. It is known as a self-clocking code because there is always a transition during the bit interval. Consequently, long strings of zeros or ones do not cause clocking problems.

== Non-Return to Zero Codes (NRZ) ==
{{wikipedia|non-return-to-zero}}

'''Non-Return to Zero''' (NRZ) codes are a bit awkwardly named, especially considering that the unipolar NRZ code does return to a zero value. In essence, an NRZ code is just a simple square wave, assigning one value to a binary 1, and another amplitude to a binary 0.

NRZ codes are more bandwidth efficient than bipolar ones. However, their spectral components go all the way down to 0 Hz. This prevents them from being used on transmission lines which are transformer coupled, or for some other reason cannot carry DC.

::[[Image:NRZ spectrum.gif]]

=== Unipolar NRZ ===

Unipolar NRZ is simply a square wave with +AV being a binary 1, and 0V being a binary 0. NRZ is convenient because computer circuits use unipolar NRZ internally, and it requires little effort to expand this system outside the computer. Unipolar NRZ has a DC term, but a relatively narrow bandwidth.

=== Bipolar NRZ ===

Bipolar NRZ operates using a bipolar voltage supply rail.  Marks typically are represented using ''negative'' voltages (e.g., -9V), while spaces with ''positive'' voltages (e.g., +9V).  For example, RS-232C/EIA-232 signaling relies on bipolar NRZ.

 -5V +5V -5V +5V -5V -5V +5V -5V -5V
  1  0   1   0   1   1   0   1   1

Bipolar NRZ has similar bandwidth and DC balance issues as unipolar NRZ.

===AMI===

AMI (alternate mark inversion) is another example of a bipolar line code. Each successive mark is inverted and the average or DC level of the line is therefor zero.

::[[Image:AMI.gif]]

AMI is usually implemented as RZ pulses, but NRZ and NRZ-I variants exist as well.

One of the weaknesses of this approach is that long strings of zeros cause the receivers to lose lock. It is therefor necessary to impose other rules on the signal to prevent this.  For example, combining NRZ-M with AMI yields MLT-3, the line coding system used with 100-base-T Ethernet.

===CDI===

The CDI(Conditioned Diphase Interface) bipolar line code is actually a slightly different form of the original FM line coding used in single-density disk drives and audio cassette tapes.  Marks are encoded as alternate polarity full period pulses. Spaces are encoded by half a period at the negative voltage and half period at the positive voltage. This coding scheme has the advantage that it requires less logic to implement than HDB3.

== Manchester ==
{{wikipedia|Manchester code}}

'''Manchester''' codes were an invention that allows for timing information to be sent along with the data. In an NRZ code, if there is a long stream of ones or zeros, the receiver could conceivably suffer so much compound jitter that it would either lose or gain an entire bit time, and then be out of sync with the transmitter. This is because a long stream of 1s or 0s would not &quot;change state&quot; at all, but instead would simply stay at a single value. Manchester codes say that every single bittime will have a transition in the middle of the bit time, so that a receiver could find that transition, and &quot;lock on&quot; to the signal again, if it started to stray away from center. Because there are more transitions, however, manchester codes also require the highest bandwidth of all the line codes.

{{Info|Ethernet LAN uses manchester codes}}

== Differential Codes ==


Some communication channels (such as  phase-modulated sine waves and differential twisted pairs) have the characteristic that transitions between the 2 symbols used can be easily distinguished, but when first starting to receive it is difficult to tell which of the 2 states it is in.
For example, full-speed USB uses a twisted pair and transmits +3.3 V on one line and 0 V on the other line for &quot;1&quot;, but 0 V on the one line and +3.3 V on the other line for &quot;0&quot;.
Because some cables have an extra half-twist in them, it is impossible for a device that was just plugged in to tell whether the symbol it is currently receiving is a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;.

Differential codes still work, not even noticing when the 2 wires get switched.


Differential codes, in general, look exactly the same on a oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer as the non-differential code they are based on, and so use exactly the same bandwidth and have exactly the same bitrate.

Differential codes that work when the 2 wires get switched include:
* Differential Manchester encoding -- based on Manchester encoding
* Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) -- based on non-return-to-zero (NRZ)

(A few non-differential codes also work even when the 2 wires get switched -- such as bipolar encoding, and MLT-3 encoding).

&lt;!-- totally wrong.

Differential codes are based on the premise that if the receiver remembers previous bits, the transmitter can send future bits using less data. Let us say we have a situation where when we want to transmit a 0, the signal stays the same. However when we want to send a 1, the signal has to send to another value. 

We have a receiver that can produce 2 values: +5V and -5V. We have the channel initialized to +5V at the beginning. If we want to send a 0, we stay at +5V, but if we want to send a 1, we change state to -5V instead.

If we want to transmit the data 1100100, we would send the following sequences of voltages:

    +5V     -5V   +5V   +5V   +5V   -5V   -5V   -5V
 (initial)   1     1     0     0     1     0     0

Every time we want to send a 1, the signal changes, but when we want to send a 0, the signal stays the same. Because there are fewer transitions, differential codes, in general, use the least amount of bandwidth.

--&gt;

=== Differential NRZ ===

=== Differential Manchester ===
Differential Manchester encoding, also called biphase mark code (BMC) or FM1, is a line code in which data and clock signals are combined to form a single 2-level self-synchronizing data stream. It is a differential encoding, using the presence or absence of transitions to indicate logical value. It has the following advantages over some other line codes:
•	A transition is guaranteed at least once every bit, allowing the receiving device to perform clock recovery.
•	Detecting transitions is often less error-prone than comparing against a threshold in a noisy environment.
•	Unlike with Manchester encoding, only the presence of a transition is important, not the polarity. Differential coding schemes will work exactly the same if the signal is inverted (wires swapped). (Other line codes with this property include NRZI, bipolar encoding, coded mark inversion, and MLT-3 encoding).
•	If the high and low signal levels have the same voltage with opposite polarity, coded signals have zero average DC voltage, thus reducing the necessary transmitting power and minimizing the amount of electromagnetic noise produced by the transmission line.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Achondroplasia'''

==Contracting==
*Make small talk and establish rapport with the family
*Elicit the families concerns for
*Elicit Medical History
*Elicit Family History/Pedigree
*AAP Guidelines for Newborns:
*Examination-
**Confirm diagnosis
**Document all measurements on achondroplasia growth charts. Also include the following measurements: Occipital frontal circumference, body length, upper to lower segment ratio
*Guidance-
**Discuss AD inheritance
**Most individuals have normal intelligence and normal life expectancy
**Growth hormone is not an effective treatment
**Leg lengthening procedures are currently available
**Final height is approximately 4 foot for both males and females
**Discuss possible complications:
***Kyphosis (associated with unsupported sitting)
***Small foramen magnum-could lead to cord compression
***Hydrocephalus- OFC size should be monitored
***Spinal stenosis- rarely occurs in childhood; in older individuals it manifests as numbness, weakness, and altered deep tendon reflexes (individuals with severe kyphosis are at an increased risk for this)
**Psychosocial issues
***Refer family to support group such as LPA or HGF
***Remind parents that most individuals with achondroplasia lead productive, independent lives
***Discuss with the family how to tell others about the diagnosis
***Supply family with support material
**Discuss recurrence risks for future pregnancies

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance- autosomal dominant- 75-80% arise from sporadic mutations. Correlated with advanced paternal age; virtually all new mutations arise in the father's germinal cells.
*Chromosome location- 4p16
*Molecular genetics-molecular origin arises from a mutation in one copy of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene.
**FGFR3 has an ORF of 2520 nucleotides, encoding an 840 residue protein
**&gt;99% of cases are caused by a nucleotide change (either G to A= 98% of cases or G to C=1% of cases) at nucleotide 1138, resulting in a Gly380Arg amino acid substitution
**When FGFR3 is mutated, its normal inhibitory function is constitutively activated (turned on regardless of whether or not fibroblast growth factor is bound to it). This results in the increased inhibition of growth of cartilage cells.
**Mutations in achondroplasia can be interpreted as a gain-of-function mutation that activates the fundamentally negative growth factor exerted by the FGFR3 pathway.
*Penetrance- fully penetrant.
*Homozygosity for the mutation usually results in lethality

==Incidence==
*Achondroplasia is the most commonly recognizable form of skeletal dysplasia
*Prevalence is estimated to be 1:26,000-28,000

==Clinical Features/Diagnostic Criteria==
*Short stature 100%
*Rhizomelic (proximal) shortening of the limbs with redundant skin folds
*Limited elbow extension
*Short fingers held in a trident configuration
*Bowed legs
*Thoracolumbar gibbus (hump or protuberance) in infancy
*Exaggerated lumbar lordosis (swayback) develops when walking begins
*Large head with frontal bossing (prominence)
*Midface hypoplasia
*Modestly constricted chest

==Radiologic Findings==
*Small skull base and foramen magnum
*Narrowing rather than widening of the interpediculate distance in the lumbar spine; short vertebral bodies
*Square iliac wings (square pelvis)
*Flat acetabulae (the cavity that provides the socket in which the head of the femur fits, narrowing of the sacrosciatic notch and characteristic radiolucency (penetrable by radiation) of the proximal femora
*Short, thick long bones
*Flared metaphyses (the growing portion of a bone)
*Short proximal and middle phalanges

==Occurrence/Recurrence Risks==
*One parent with achondroplasia-
**Risk for each pregnancy is 50%
*Both parents have achondroplasia-
**25% normal stature, 50% achondroplasia, 25% homozygous achondroplasia-lethal

==Natural History/Life Span==
*Most individuals with achondroplasia have a normal lifespan
*These individuals are at an increased risk for premature death
**Usually the risk arises in infancy or childhood
**One study found a 7.5% increased risk for death in the first year.
**Usually associated with foraminal compression of the upper cervical cord or lower brain stem
**Overall, mean survival is 10% less than in the general population

==Testing==
*Diagnostic-
**Clinical diagnosis is a reasonable approach, FGFR3 molecular testing is reserved for rare instances in which the clinical diagnosis is in doubt
**Molecular test is both straightforward and currently available
**The molecular PCR-based test is a direct mutation test that looks for a nucleotide change at the 1138th nucleotide.
*Prenatal-
**Can be done in a high risk pregnancy, in which one or both parents are affected
***Uses DNA extracted from fetal cells (First, the mutation must be identified in the affected parent)
**Can also be done in a low risk pregnancy. Routine ultrasound may reveal short fetal limbs (usually not apparent until the 3rd trimester)
**Individuals with this indication may be offered amniocentesis so that a diagnosis can be confirmed/rejected.

==Explanation of Findings + Management/Treatment Options==
*Growth and Feeding-
**Height/length should be monitored at each visit and plotted on achondroplasia specific growth charts.
**Measures should be taken during adolescence to monitor/prevent obesity
**No treatment will reverse the growth deficiency
**Growth hormone therapy has not significantly affected growth
**Extended limb lengthening techniques has been shown to increase height by up to 12 inches. Procedure involves cutting through the bone, and stretching it as the fractured region heals
*Development and Behavior-
**Overall individuals have normal cognitive development and function but they also have delayed and unusual motor development
**Some have language related problems-may be due to high frequency of chronic ear infections/hearing loss
**A very small amount will have severe learning problems or MR
**Hypotonia may be indicative of problems at the craniocervical junction
**Assessment for special needs is crucial
**Various adaptive devices such as stools and furniture modifications can be used to assist in short stature/hypotonia needs.
*Neurological-
**Hydrocephalus-
***Assessment of ventricular size and volume of extra-axial fluid by ultrasound, MRI, or computerized tomography at diagnosis
***All children should have serial HC measurements plotted on achondroplasia specific growth charts every 1-2 months until 1 year of age and then at each visit thereafter.
***Signs of increased intracranial pressure include, accelerated head growth, bulging fontanel, lethargy or irritability, unexplained vomiting and headaches.
***If any of these signs occur, MRI should be done and compared to the one obtained at diagnosis
***If hydrocephalus has developed, shunting should be performed- prognosis is usually favorable
**Cervicomedullary Junction Constriction-
***Every infant with Achondroplasia has a small and often misplaced foramen magnum due to abnormal growth of the endochondral cranial base
***Causes risk for apnea-associated death or paralysis
***These apnea related deaths often arise due to compression at the craniocervical junction, resulting in damage to the respiratory control centers in the lower medulla.
***Compression can also result in high cervical myelopathy, which leads to hypotonia, weakness, hyperreflexia, asymmetric reflexes and ankle clonus.
***Doctors should carefully examine the patient
***Neuroimaging- tomography or MRI of the brain
***Overnight sleep study in a sleep center should be performed
***Parents and care providers should be counseled concerning careful neck support and handling. All strollers, jumpers, baby seats etc. should support the head, and limit movement.
***If evidence of cord compression is present (from MRI) surgical decompression should be done immediately. Approximately 8% of individuals with achondroplasia undergo this type of surgery.
*Respiratory-
**Individuals with achondroplasia have small thoraces. This may result in decreased effective lung volumes, decreased respiratory reserve, and increased hypoxemia.
**Snoring is a uniform feature and should not be reflective of an obstruction of the airway
**Obstruction of the airway is common in individuals (#'s vary according to study)
***May be due to hypoplasia of the cranial base and midface (resulting in diminution of the airway size) as well as hypertrophy of the lymphatic ring
**In some, appropriate positive airway pressure at night is used to maintain appropriate oxygen saturations.
**Sleep studies are recommended
**Surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids may be necessary
**Tracheostomy may be needed in rare occasions (2% or less)
*Ears and Hearing-
**Middle ear dysfunction is a frequent complication, &gt;50% have it severe enough to require myringotomy and ventilation tube placement
**ENT evaluation should be done at 6months of age and then every 6-9 months throughout preschool.
**Hearing loss may result in speech and language delays. In these cases, a referral should be made for speech and language therapy.
*Musculoskeletal-
**Kyphosis-
***Present in 90-95% of infants
***Usually spontaneously resolves
***Clinical evaluation of the spine every 6 months through 3 years of age
***If kyphosis is moderate or marked, radiographic assessment should be obtained
***Parents should be counseled against allowing unsupported sitting during the first year of life
***Bracing may be needed if the radiograph shows and irreversible curve of &gt;30°
***Surgical intervention may be necessary
**Lumbosacral Spinal Stenosis-
***Stenosis of the entire spinal canal is uniformly present; more problematic in adults
***Symptoms include: numbness, dysesthesias, radicular pain, leg weakness, clumsiness, gait changes, problems associated with bowel and bladder dribbling
***MRI will assess the severity and level of the stenosis
***Intervention methods include: neurosurgical laminectomy,
***Decompression laminectomy usually results in some improvement of symptoms and function. Only 50% of patients show long-term benefits, additional surgery is often needed.

==Knee instability==
*Nearly all young individuals with achondroplasia have knee instability.
*Hyperextension of between 20-70°
*Contributes to the motor delays seen in these individuals
*Bracing may be needed for severe knee instability (rare)
**Varus deformity-
***Bowleg deformity
***Assessment should be made while child is standing
***Three weight bearing joints should be &quot;in plumb&quot;
***Surgery may be needed for those with severe misalignment
**Other-
***Most develop lordosis- swayback
****May exacerbate risk for spinal stenosis in the lumbosacral region (in adults)
****May be associated with pain at the apex resulting in chronic coccydynia
****Coccydynia can be treated by sewing padding into the underwear
***Hypermobility of the shoulders
***Limitation of elbow movement
****Surgical intervention for elbow limitation is not indicated, rather adaptive devices should be used
***Hypermobile wrists
****Discomfort and fatique of wrists from doing fine motor tasks may be relieved by a stabilizing brace
***Orthodontics
****Crowding of the teeth
****Palatal expansion or braces

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Thanatophoric dysplasia- nearly always a lethal condition; more severe findings than achondroplasia
*Homozygous achondroplasia
*Hypochondroplasia- milder findings than achondroplasia

==Common Psychosocial Issues==
*Anxiety concerning the diagnosis
*Fear of the associated complications
*Adjusting and adaptation worries for the family
*Family support- support groups

==Support Groups==
*The Little people of America (LPA)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Amniocentesis'''

==Introduction==
*Welcome and acknowledge any prior phone contact.
*Discuss the reason for referral. Do they understand why they were sent to genetics?
*Assess their concerns and what they hope to gain from the session.
*Assess their degree of knowledge about genetics, heredity, AMA, etc.
*Provide overview of the session and discussion topics.

==Prenatal Intake==
*Obtain client and partner information (age, occupation, ethnicity, religion, consanguinity, health)
*Elicit family history and construct pedigree.
*Pregnancy history (dates, procedures, exposures, complications)
*Discuss population pregnancy information - every pregnancy has a 3-5% risk for congenital malformations; every pregnancy has a 2-3% risk of miscarriage.

==What is AMA?==
*Advanced maternal age applies to anyone aged 35 years or above at the expected date of delivery.
*As maternal age increases, the risk of birth defects (particularly chromosomal abnormalities) increases.
*Age 35 is the cutoff for AMA because this is the point where the procedural risk equals the risk of aneuploidy.

==What are chromosomal abnormalities?==
*Explanation of chromosomes.
*Explanation of meiosis, haploid germ cells, fertilization to a diploid zygote.
*Explanation of non-disjunction. Focus on how women are born with all their eggs and they mature with age.
*Discuss common trisomies/monosomies (13, 18, 21, 47XXY, 45X), show karotypes, and give general description of clinical features and prognoses.

==Risk Assessment==
*Discuss client's age-related mid-trimester risks for any chromosomal abnormalities and for Down syndrome in particular.
*Record data on intake.

==What are the testing options?==
*Triple Marker Screening:
**Maternal blood test performed at 15-22 weeks.
**Screening test only, NOT diagnostic.
**Indirect measurement of fetal AFP, hCG, uE3 production.
**Detects approx. 85% NTDs, up to 85-90% of DS, and up to 80% of Trisomy 18 in women with AMA.
**False-positive rate of 25% in women over 35 years of age.
**Does not detect all chromosomal abnormalities assoc. with AMA

==Ultrasound==
*Can detect many major birth defects.
*Some fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities have characteristics that can be seen by ultrasound as &quot;markers&quot;, but others have no visible anomalies.
*Ultrasound can NOT diagnose chromosome abnormalities.

==Amniocentesis==
*Medical procedure that removes a small sample of amniotic fluid (made of fetal urine, contains fetal skin cells) from the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus.
*Usually performed between 15-18 weeks (although some labs will interpret data from 13.5 to 21 weeks)
*Fluid is used for genetic analysis - fetal karyotyping, biochemical studies, DNA studies, alpha-fetoprotein and acetyl cholinesterase measurements.

==Amnio Procedure==
*Procedure takes 20-45 minutes (1-2 minutes for needle insertion).
*May be required to have a full bladder.
*Lie down on back with hands folded behind your head.
*Abdomen cleansed with betadeine.
*Local anesthetic (xylocaine) may be used to numb the outer layer of skin - this may feel like a pin prick followed by a stinging or burning sensation.
*Ultrasound is used to locate the fetus and placenta, identify the pocket of fluid, and guide the needle.
*Physician inserts the needle (22 gauge with a stylet) through the abdomen and into the uterus - some discomfort may be felt when the needle enters the skin and then the uterus (may feel like a menstrual cramp); a sharp pain lasting a few seconds may be felt when the needle enters the amniotic sac.
*Stylet is removed and the first few cc of fluid are discarded due to possible maternal cell contamination. About 20 cc (1 tablespoon) of amniotic fluid is removed - may feel pressure in the lower abdomen when the fluid is withdrawn; is quickly replaced by the fetus.
*Needle is removed, bandage applied, fetal heart activity is monitored by ultrasound, no overnight hospital stay.
*Fluid is sent to lab and results are available in 1-2 weeks. Discuss how results will be received.
*About 95% of women receive a negative result.
*Total cost is $600-$900.
*Afterwards, no strenuous activity for 24 hours. Follow up with MSAFP at 16-18 weeks and ultrasound at 18-20 weeks.

==Benefits of Amnio==
*Accuracy of karyotype is &gt;99% (NTD detection is about 90-96%).
*Can detect chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidies).
*Can detect neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly).
*Tells the sex of the fetus.

==Limitations of Amnio==
*Does not detect all possible birth defects (only about 10% of 400 known congenital malformations).
*Cannot predict the severity of the defect/disorder.
*If first procedure fails, a second may be attempted that same day. If it doesn't work, then additional procedures should be postponed for 3-7 days.
*Cell culture failure could occur (rare, &lt;1%).

==Risks Associated with Amnio==
*Risk of miscarriage - 1/200 (0.5% beyond background risk).
*Rh (-) mothers must be given RhoGam in order to prevent blood group sensitization.
*Uterine cramping is not uncommon.
*Notify your doctor is you have transient spotting or leakage of amniotic fluid (2-3% of cases).
*Very rare chance of infection to uterus, hemorrhage, or maternal death.
*Risk of birth defects due to amnio is remote (risk of clubfoot increased during early amnio).

==Conclusion==
*Discuss psychosocial issues that may arise.
*Remind that no decision has to be made today.
*Review and summarize.
*Answer final questions and concerns.
*Give out patient resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)'''

==Introduction==
*What are your main reasons for seeing us today for genetic counseling?
*Ask them if they have any particular questions or concerns they would like to discuss.
*Address any concerns or explain that they will be discussed later
*Provide an overview of what we will be doing including a discussion of their concerns or questions

==Obtain Pregnancy and Family History==
*How far along is the pregnancy?
*How was that determined?
*Have you had any complications with your pregnancy?
*Have you had an ultrasound?
*When was prenatal care begun?
*Have you taken any medications since you were pregnant or before you realized you were pregnant?
*Have you had any alcoholic beverages since you were pregnant?
*Any drugs?
*Are you taking prenatal vitamins? When did you start them?
*How many total pregnancies have you had?
*Have you had any miscarriages or elective terminations?
*Do you work outside the home? What is your occupation?
*Husband's or partner's employment?
*Do you or your husband/partner have a religious preference?
*I would like to obtain some family medical history information. Some of the questions I will ask will help us determine if there are any hereditary disorders that we may want to discuss.
*Take basic 3 generation pedigree unless something else seems significant
*Ask about: her three pregnancy losses and may want to explain reason for most recent loss. Also ask about MR/learning difficulties in school, birth defects such as cleft lip or palate or heart defects, anyone die young or unexpectedly, anyone with bleeding disorders, cancers, any other health problems that you think might be hereditary?

==Explanation of Advanced Maternal Age==
*Are you familiar with the age related risk associated with having a baby with some specific chromosomal abnormalities?
*As women get older their risk for having a baby with a change in the number of chromosomes in their cells increases. There is no magic age at which a woman goes from no risk to high risk. However, at age 35 the risk is considered high enough to offer some standard testing options that we will discuss today.
*Explain chromosomes and genes
*Explain nondisjunction
**Sometimes when the egg or sperm form, the chromosomes don't separate and an egg or sperm ends up with an extra copy of a chromosome
**This is called nondisjunction and it is a random, chance event that does not run in families
**Although it is a random event, it does occur more often as a woman gets older
**After fertilization, there are now 47 chromosomes rather than the usual 46
**When there is an extra copy we call it trisomy because there are three copies instead of the usual two copies
**Often when there is extra genetic material there are changes in the way the fetus grows and develops
**When a fetus has an extra chromosome there is also a higher risk of having a miscarriage as occurred in your last pregnancy
**However some fetuses with certain extra chromosomes may survive to birth.

==Down syndrome==
*Discuss previous pregnancy loss due to trisomy 21 or Down syndrome
*Trisomy 21 (most common cause of Down syndrome) is the third most common autosomal trisomy to be observed in fetuses that don't survive
*Approximately 23% of fetuses with Down syndrome will be lost between midtrimester and term
*Trisomy 21 is the most common trisomy in babies that are born
*Are you familiar with the characteristics of Down syndrome?
*Children with Down syndrome are all unique, but often have distinguishable physical characteristics that you might recognized.
*They are all cognitively impaired and this is most often mild to moderate
*Nearly half of children born with Down Syndrome have heart defects and they are at an increased risk for some other specific birth defects or medical concerns

==Trisomy 18, 13==
*Two of the other common trisomies are trisomy 18 and 13.
*Children with these conditions are more severely affected than those with Down Syndrome.
*They usually have a variety of birth defects and are severely cognitively impaired.
*Many miscarry and there is a high rate of mortality during infancy

==Other chromosome abnormalities involving the sex chromosomes==
*Other chromosome abnormalities that you may be at an increased risk for due to age involves the sex chromosomes (Smith's quotes that there is a marked increase in maternal age associated with maternally derived 47XXY males where the error was in meiosis 1. However, the error can also be in maternal meiosis II and half of males with 47XXY result from paternal meiosis 1 errors)
*Babies can have an extra copy of one of the sex chromosomes and sometimes they remain undiagnosed until later in life
*They usually have an average IQ, but may experience learning difficulties in school.
*They don't usually have serious medical problems associated with having extra sex chromosomes, but they may be infertile.

==Age Related Risks==
*Age related risks (refer to chart in visual aids)
**Live born baby with Down Syndrome 1 in 112 almost 1%
**at age 42 risk of a live born with any chromosomal abnormality is 1 in 65 around 1.6%
**chance of having a liveborn child without a chromosomal abnormality detected is 98.4%
**risks are higher of having an affected fetus during pregnancy though because of the high miscarriage rates in fetuses with a chromosome abnormality
*quote risks at amnio and CVS if interested at amnio risk is 1 in 41 for all chromosome abnormalities and at time of CVS risk for all is 1 in 28 and at amnio risk for Down syndrome is 1 in 86

==Prenatal Testing Options During First and Second Trimester==
*Two tests that are diagnositic and can tell us with greater than 99% [source?] accuracy whether the fetus has a chromosomal abnormality
*CVS (10-12 weeks)
*Amniocentesis around 15 weeks
*(Have you read any information about CVS or amniocentesis?)
*Option to undergo no testing
*Screening
*First trimester prenatal screening plus ultrasound
*blood test and ultrasound combined will detect 91% of Down syndrome and 97% for trisomy 18, 40% of heart defects and some other birth defects
*blood tests measures levels of 2 proteins freeBeta-hCG and PAPP-A
*ultrasound measures nuchal translucency (increased neck width)
*not diagnostic of a chromosome abnormality but shows whether risks are increased
*Level II ultrasound in second trimester will help in determining the overall development of the major organs. It will show some birth defects, which may provide a clue about whether or not there is a chromosomal abnormality. However, not all birth defects are detected by amnio, and the presence of a birth defect will not indicate for certain if there is a chromosomal abnormality

==Chorionic Villus Sampling Overview==
*Often referred to simply as CVS
*CVS is a technique in which a sample of placental tissue is obtained
*The little fingerlike projections of the placenta that are sampled are called chorionic villi
*The villi are derived from the same original cells as the fetus so these cells should have the same genes and chromosomes as the fetus and we can look at the chromosomes in these cells and detect the chromosomal abnormalities discussed earlier
*CVS is performed between 10 and 12 weeks gestation

(CVS has been around since 1983 in US)

==What Information CVS Can Provide==
*It is a diagnostic test that can determine if the fetus has one of the chromosomal abnormalities we discussed with 98-99% accuracy.
*It can also determine the sex of the fetus if you would like to know.
*DNA obtained from the sample can also be used to test for certain specific genetic disorders if the fetus is at risk

==Limitations: Information CVS Does Not Provide==
*Most birth defects cannot be detected by CVS or amnio. (Amnio can detect about 10% of birth defects). For example cleft lip, cleft palate, congental heart defects, and many types of mental retardation will not be detected.
*CVS doesn't routinely test for heritable disorders such as cystic fibrosis unless there is a risk for a specific disorder and a special test is ordered.
*CVS does not test for whether the fetus has a neural tube defect (i.e. spina bifida or anencephaly
*About 95% of women who undergo a CVS will have a negative test result. However, a negative test result from CVS does not guarantee a healthy baby. (3-5 out of every hundred babies have a birth defect).
*There is a 1-2% chance that the test will be inaccurate (reasons for this will be discussed later)

==Associated Risks==
*1% additional risk for pregnancy loss. This is above the baseline risk of miscarriage that all women have. (At 10-12 weeks this spontaneous loss rate is 2-3%) In other words, about 1 out of every 100 women who have CVS will have a miscarriage that is due directly to the procedure.
*Extremely low risk of uterine infection
*Some studies reported a possible risk of limb defects while other studies have not. Most of the defects were noted if the procedure was performed before 10 weeks because the limbs develop between 4-10 wks. The increased risk of limb defects is about 1 in 3000 compared with the norm of 6 per 10,000.

==Amniocentsis VS. CVS==
*Amniocentesis is another option that can be performed later in the pregnancy and will test for the same chromosomal abnormalities as well as neural tube defects, but ONTD's can be detected 85% of the time with MSAFP (blood test performed after 14 weeks)
*Review visual aid that compares the two procedures on timing, risk, accuracy etc.

==Reasons Some Women Choose CVS==
(This is a personal decision and each woman places different emphasis on the things that are important to her)
*Permits termination at earlier gestational age
*1st trimester and people often don't know that she is pregnant
*Early termination has been reported to be easier emotionally and physically
*They want reassurance that the fetus does not have a chromosomal abnormality
**Allows treatment for a fetus with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (CAH) autosomal recessive condition in which shots of dexamethosone can be given

==Reasons Some Women Choose Amniocentesis==
*Lower risk of pregnancy loss 0.5% instead of 1%
*Results are slightly more accurate &gt;99% compared to 98-99%
*Offers detection of open neural tube defects (90-96%)
*However, a maternal blood test (MSAFP) can be performed later in pregnancy (14-22 wks) and will detect 85% of open NTD's
*Procedure is easier and more hospitals perform it
*With CVS there is a greater likelihood of needing further testing due to
**Laboratory failure
**Maternal cell contamination
***Frequency 1.9%
***Not problematic for cytogenetics because they do maternal karyotype also, can be problem for DNA or biochemical testing
**Mosaic or ambiguous results
***Presence of two or more groups of cells that differ in their chromosome make up
***Occurs in 1-2% of CVS samples
***less concerning in CVS than amnio because the placental cells are more distantly related they split off from the cells in the embryo early on so fetus might not share same genetic make up
**Insufficient sample

==Reasons Women Choose Not to Undergo Either Procedure==
*They don't want to take that added risk of miscarriage
*They are more anxious about the procedure than they are about having a child with a chromosomal abnormality
*They feel comfortable not knowing if there is one of these problems until they deliver the child
*They don't feel a need for reassurance and would not abort the fetus regardless of the result
*Moral or religious views

==Description OF CVS==
*There are two ways the procedure can be performed: Transcervical and Transabdominal Transcervical is the way Dr. Sedicke will usually perform it.
*Contraindications for both types include:
**Active vaginal bleeding (must have stopped at least 1 week ago)
**Don't worry about Rh sensitization because she is O positive
**Maternal bleeding disorder
**Fibroids not avoidable
**Multiple gestation? (usually not attempted)
*Transcervical
**Procedure is similar to a pap smear
**Vagina and cervix are cleaned
**Under the visual guidance of ultrasound, a thin tube (catheter) inserted through the vagina, cervix, and into the placenta
**Once the catheter is in place a syringe is attached
**Suction is applied to remove the villi while the catheter is removed
**After the sample is obtained it is viewed under a microscope to be sure the size and quality is sufficient and another sample is not needed
**Sample is placed in a tube of tissue culture medium and sent to a lab for testing
**Most women report minimal discomfort during the procedure although it varies
**The actual procedure only takes about 5 minutes
**The baby's heart beat will be monitored
**Bleeding occurs in up to 10% of women
**(Easiest to perform with posterior placenta close to cervix)
**(Contraindications for transcervical CVS include: cervical polyps, overly curved sampling pathway, active genital herpes or other infections)
**(Large sample is obtained including whole villi)
*Transabdominal
**Abdomen is cleansed and xylocaine injection is given to numb the upper layers (similar to shot given at the dentist)
**Using ultrasound as visual guidance, spinal needle is guided through the abdominal wall, uterine wall, and into the placenta
**Once in place a syringe is attached to supply suction
**While suction is supplied the needle is moved back and forth through the placenta
**After sample is obtained it is viewed to make sure there is enough and another sample is not required
**Sample is then placed in a tube of tissue culture medium and sent to a lab for testing
**There is a wide range of responses when it comes to how women report the procedure felt. When the needle is inserted it may burn for a few seconds. Women report everything from mild cramping to painful, heavy cramping.
**The actual procedure takes about 5 minutes
**The heartbeat of the fetus will be monitored
**Bleeding is rare
**Contraindications for transabdominal CVS include: interceding bowel, the placenta is too far from the maternal abdominal surface (obesity)
**(Easiest to perform with anterior or fundal placenta)
**(Smaller sample size (pieces of the villi) obtained)
**(Can be performed after 12 weeks, but usually only if there is not enough amniotic fluid for an amniocentesis)

==Recommendations for After CVS==
*No exercise or strenuous activity for 24 hours
*No sexual intercourse, douching, tub baths, or tampon use for 72 hours
*Notify the OB in any of the following occur:
**Fever greater than 100.4 degrees F
**Heavy bleeding or cramping
**Amniotic fluid leakage
*Return for follow up ultrasound ?????
*Blood test (MSAFP) at 16-18 weeks to check for ONTD's
*Ultrasound is recommended at 18-20 weeks
*Shot of Rho-gam if Rh negative

==Test Results==
*Results will be available anywhere between 1-2 weeks
*More than 95% of women receive reassuring news
*Remind them that sometimes further follow-up testing is needed to confirm a result.
*Ask them how they would like to receive their results and if they want to know the sex of the fetus

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*May be nervous about pregnancy loss and may have beliefs that she did something to cause
*Explain that sometimes women are concerned about how something they did was responsible for pregnancy losses
*Be reassuring if possible especially about the last one where we know the cause had nothing to do with what she did or didn't do before or during pregnancy
*May have difficulty deciding on whether to have prenatal test due to risks so help her look at risks and benefits and judge whether the benefit associated with likely reassurance of a normal pregnancy is worth the risk
*Sometimes the anxiety of the procedure is greater than the anxiety over the risks or vice versa and helping them determine this may be helpful in the decision making process.
*May feel bad or be very concerned about having a child at an older age so assess what is worrisome. Reassure that many women are having children at that age and the age women have children is increasing. There are many benefits to having children at an older age such as (maturity, financial stability, prior time for career or other goals)
*May be concerned about alcohol exposures. Can be very reassuring if the alcohol was early on before pregnancy was known. Usually large amount of alcohol or continual exposure is necessary to harm fetus.
*May be nervous about needles. Explore this and discuss the fear and support she will have present during procedure. Or ask if she would like one of us to accompany her if time will allow.
*Anxiety and other emotions are likely to be present, but some individuals try to keep them from surfacing.

==CF Carrier Screening==
*Are you familiar with cystic fibrosis?
*CF is one of the most common inherited diseases (affects 1 in 3300 live births in US)
*Occurs more frequently in Caucasians than other ethnicities (one in 25,000 affected and 1 in 28 are carriers)
*causes body to produce thick mucus which leads to a greater risk of infections that sometimes requires hospitalization
*can affect digestion and cause diarrhea and failure to grow normally
*with the advancement of treatments over year life span increased average age in the 30's
*may cause decreased fertility in females and often causes infertility in males
*AR inheritance, both parents must be carriers to have child with CF
*a blood test is offered that can determine if an individual is a carrier of CF
*assess whether interested in this testing

==Contracting==
*How has your pregnancy been going? Have there been any complications?
*What is your understanding of why you were referred for genetic counseling?
*What specific questions/concerns would you like to address today?

==Maternal Age Associated Pregnancy Risks==
*Women over age of 35 considered at &quot;high risk&quot; for chromosomal abnormalities
*Explain chromosomes and nondisjunction
*Common trisomies associated with advanced maternal age
**Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome)
***Caused by presence of 3 copies of chromosome 21
***Can result in characteristic facies, mild to moderate mental retardation, congenital heart disease and other health problems
***Varying range of severity
***Many children can go to school, adults may hold jobs and live semi-independently
**Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) and Trisomy 18 (Edward Syndrome)
***Caused by presence of 3 copies of chromosome 13 or 18
***More severe medical issues than those associated with Down Syndrome
***Usually fatal within first year of life
**Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY)
***Caused by presence of an extra X chromosome
***Phenotypic males who may have small testes and androgen deficiency
***IQ may be 10-15 points lower than average

==Testing Options==
*Triple marker screening
**Blood test performed at 15-22 weeks gestation

      <text xml:space="preserve">This tutorial will show you how to add text and speech bubbles to pre-made art in The GIMP v2.0 or later.


== Getting started ==


=== Make a copy ===


This step isn't strictly necessary, but it's a good idea that could save you from repeating steps if something goes horribly wrong.  It's a '''very''' good idea if you're working on the only copy of your source image.


(Better yet, '''don't''' work on the only copy of your source image.)


[[Image:gimpbubble01.png]]


When you open an image in The GIMP, it automatically becomes the background layer.  Anything added to the image will be added as a higher layer, sitting above the background layer.  You can combine layers by clicking ''Layers &gt; Merge Down'', and you'll probably want to at some stage, so you can work on multiple added items at the same time.


Right-click the ''Background''' layer and select '''Duplicate'''.  That way, if you accidentally merge the wrong layer down onto a lower one, or perform an operation that seems like a good idea but isn't (and can't be rolled back), you haven't overwritten the only copy of the art you have.

=== Add a filter ===


You'll most likely be adding text in black.  If the background is dark as well, the text will be almost invisible and difficult to work with.  You can make it easier to view dark text on a dark background by adding a semi-opaque layer between them in a light colour.  To do this:


Click ''Layers &gt; New Layer'' and select a transparent background.


[[Image:gimpbubble02.png]]



[[Image:gimpbubble03.png]]


To add the filter, select the ''Fill'' tool and select white as the colour to use. Reduce the opacity to 50% and click anywhere on the new layer.  You'll see the image turn milky, because you're now viewing the background image through a semi-transparent white layer.  Any text you lay down on top of this will be easy to see, and after you've added the speech bubbles around it, the filter can be removed, leaving the background looking like it did to begin with.

[[Image:gimpbubble04.png]]


[[Image:gimpbubble05.png]]

== Text ==


=== Adding the text ===


To select the Text tool, press ''T''.  Select the colour, font and size you prefer.  ''Use anti-alias'' should be ticked.  Jagged edges on your text will make it harder to read, especially if the image is resized.  Centre-aligned text is often best, too.


[[Image:gimpbubble06.png]]


[[Image:gimpbubble07.png]]

=== Positioning ===

After the text box is closed, the text tool automatically changes to the '''Move''' tool.  At this point, if you try to move the text, you'll see it slide out of the box and vanish completely off the edges of the layer.  Since you probably do want to move the text, to get it positioned just right, you'll want to expand the layer to the full size of the image.  To do this:


Click ''Layer &gt; Layer to Image Size''.


[[Image:gimpbubble08.png]]


Now you can select your text with the ''Rectangular selection'' tool.  As soon as the mouse is released, the selection tool changes to the ''Move'' tool and you can simply drag your text to where it needs to be.

=== Combining styles ===


The GIMP text tool applies a single style to an entire block of text, so an example of what you '''can't''' do is bold or italicise individual words.  (In other words, the previous sentence would be impossible.)  To mix styles, add all the text of one style in a single layer, taking care to leave the space for the other styled text, then add a second text layer written in the second style, positioning it over the first.


[[Image:gimpbubble09.png]]

== Bubbles ==


=== Background ===


Once you have all the necessary text on the screen and in the right position, you can create the bubbles.  First, add a new layer, below the text layer.  This part of the process will involve painting out a section of the current layer, so if it's the same layer your text is on, you'll lose it.


[[Image:gimpbubble10.png]]


Next, change to the ''Elliptical selection'' tool.  Once again, make sure to anti-alias.  Draw an oval around the text, making sure to leave enough white space so the text isn't crowded.  This will become the bubble.  


[[Image:gimpbubble11.png]]


To add a stalk pointing to a character, change to the ''Path'' tool.  (The GIMP's Path tool mirrors the Photoshop Bézier Curve tool.)  This allows you to mark out an area to be added to the selection you made with the Ellipse tool.  


[[Image:gimpbubble12.png]]


First, click and release the mouse on a starting point just inside the oval.  Next, click where you want the point of the stalk to be.  If you want a straight line, release and continue to the next step.  If you prefer a curve, hold the mouse button down and drag the pointer away from the second point.  The line will deform into a curve.  It'll take a bit of experimentation to get it exactly where you want it, but it's a nice effect.


[[Image:gimpbubble13.png]]


Click back into the oval to complete the other side of the stalk. Now you have an oval around the text, and on top of that, a stalk. 


Move back to the dialogues window again, and click the Paths tab.  Right-click the uppermost path on the stack and select ''Add to selection''.  


[[Image:gimpbubble14.png]]


Now the entire speech bubble including the stalk will have the blinking dashed line around it.


[[Image:gimpbubble15.png]]


At this stage, you can experiment a little bit to add some variety among the different speech bubble shapes you have.  For instance, the '''script-fu''' menu's '''selection''' options offers the '''distress selection''' tool, which will make the outline a bit more random.


Finally, select an appropriate background colour (white is the classic) and then the Fill tool again.  (Make sure you raise the opacity back to 100% unless you prefer the speech bubble to be semi-transparent on top of your background image.)  Click inside the selection and it will fill with the selected background colour out to the edges.  Your text should now be invisible behind the background colour.  Don't try working with the text or any other task yet, because you still need the speech bubble selected.

=== Border ===


Now that you have the speech bubble filled, you can add a black (or any other colour) border to it.  To do this, first select a foreground colour and then:


Click ''Edit &gt; Stroke selection...''.


[[Image:gimpbubble16.png]]


The default line thickness is 6 pixels, which is probably too thick.  1px or 2px should be plenty.  Click to confirm, and a border in the selected foreground colour will appear around the speech bubble.

In order to create a smoother border, first click ''Select &gt; To Path''.  Then, click ''Edit &gt; Stroke Path...''.  Proceed as stated in the previous paragraph.

== Cleaning up ==


=== Text in bubble ===


Now that you have speech bubbles, you want the text '''in''' them.  To accomplish this, go back to the layers window.  There's probably a whole range of layers by now, since each block of text and each speech bubble you created added one (or more) new layer.  Use the mouse to drag the speech bubble layers below the text layers and you'll see the words appear in the bubbles.


=== Removing the filter ===


Using the mouse on the layers window, select the semi-opaque layer you created.  Right-click and select ''Delete''.  You'll see the background image snap back to its original colours behind your speech bubbles.

[[Image:gimpbubble17.png]]

=== Saving your work ===


If you want to keep the different elements of the image on the separate layers, you'll need to save the image as a .xcf file, which is The GIMP's native file format.  To save it in a format you can view in a browser or slideshow program, select the appropriate extension when you save the image and confirm that the file should be exported, (losing the separation between layers in the process).

== General practices ==


We naturally start reading at the top left-hand corner of a box and proceed towards the bottom right.  The first words spoken should be higher and further towards the left unless you have some other way in addition to speech bubble stalks of making it clear which character is speaking.


Dark text on a light background is easiest to read.  Text and background should never have the same brightness even if they're different colours, since it makes it harder for the eye to distinguish between them.  and in general the text should have the 'richer' colour (e.g. red, blue, green) and the background should be a 'washed-out' colour (e.g. white, grey, pale blue).


Start big.  It's easy to scale large images down, small images scaled up will tend to be pixelated and won't look as good.


Don't crowd your images with too much talk.  Text should give way to art rather than vice versa.

== Adding thought bubbles ==


So far a very effective way of adding speech to your work has been showcased. Now it's time to get thinking!


=== Tailoring the text to your preferences ===


A quick note on tool-usage that seems to pass people by:


[[Image:ScreenShot005.jpg]]

You must open the Tool Option dialogue and use it as above to get the best out of GIMP. In this case the text editor is selected, but you also need it to use all GIMP tools effectively. It is important in the next section.

=== Creating the Bubble ===


Now what you must do is select the tool options as in the screenshot above. This is essential if you want to follow the rest of this tutorial as you will be using it a lot to make sure everything is working correctly. In this instance the Text tool is selected so you can work on all the options such as the font and text size as well as the text justification. This is essential.

Now you need to type in your text as for the speech bubble tutorial. So far all is the same. Note: I have used the same sort of filter as in the earlier tutorial.



[[Image:ScreenShot009.jpg]]


Time to add the selections for the bubble. As before select the elliptical marquee tool.



[[Image:ScreenShot010.jpg]]



However, this time you need to select the option in the screenshot above from the Tool Options dialogue. This will allow you to draw the several ellipses necessary to create a thought bubble without cancelling the selection each time you click away from it.




After this just fill and stroke as for speech bubbles, move stuff around to your satisfaction, remember to delete the filter and - one thought bubble!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Howdy There,

I have an issue with Clausius Statement in this module.
I believe you will find that it should read:
&quot;..... without external effect ( e.g. external heat or work effect or both).&quot;

A very real example of this distinction is the refrigerator
in most recreation vehicles or some large tonnage chillers.
Strictly a heat process between three ( or more ) temperatures.
These are known generally as absorption refrigerators. No compressor
or pumps. 

Sincerely and cooperatively,

John Warner

I also have a sneaking suspicion that the Clausius / Kelvin-Planck equivalencies are
backwards... I believe the first one actually violates Clausius first, which causes it to 
violate KP, and the second violates KP, causing it to violate Clausius.  A minor quibble,
I know.

Kyle

== 2nd law of thermodynamics.. ==

'''2nd law of thermodynamics..'''''Italic text''

statement about kelvin-planck and clausius is just reverse ..

the true is :

'''Kelvin-Planck from Clausius'''

Suppose we have a heat engine which can convert heat into work without rejecting heat anywhere else. We can combine it with a heat pump so that the work produced by the engine is used by the pump. Now the combined system is a heat pump which uses no external work, violating the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law.

Thus, we see that the Clausius and Kelvin-Planck statements are equivalent, and one necessarily implies the other.
'''
Clausius from Kelvin-Planck'''

Now suppose we can construct a heat pump which transfers heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature one without using external work. Then, we can couple it with a heat engine in such a way that the heat removed by the heat pump from the low temperature reservoir is the same as the heat rejected by the heat engine, so that the combined system is now a heat engine which converts heat to work without any external effect. This is thus in violation of the Clausius statement of the second law.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called AJK. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name AJK~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I think it would be a good idea to sum up how to make secure programs with REBOL and how to use the encryption functions to help with this, how to avoid running malignant code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The QoS addons for IPCop are advanced [[wikipedia:Traffic_shaping|traffic shaping]] addons to the popular [[wikipedia:Ipcop|IPCop]] firewall. Maintained as [[wikipedia:GPL|GPL]]/[[wikipedia:Creative_commons|Creative Commons]] [[wikipedia:Open_source|Open Source]] projects by [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop/news.php Markus Hoffmann].

There are currently two QoS packages being maintained, using two different packet scheduling protocols; HTB and HTSC.
__NOTOC__
== A Brief Introduction to Traffic Shaping ==
Quality of Service (QoS) is a term used to all the different modules that make up traffic shaping. QoS is an attempt to bring all these different programs and protocols together to give priority to network traffic that is time dependent, like VoIP and online games, over less time critical data transfers such as P2P or FTP traffic. If it does it well, then you can have a conversation using VoIP while downloading/uploading large files without delay or gaps in the voice call.

==Flavours==
There are two versions of the Advanced QoS Addon:
*Hierarchical Fair Service Curve scheduler (HFSC) &amp;ndash; (QoS 2.5 Ipcop 1.4.8)
*Hierarchical Token Bucket scheduler (HTB) &amp;ndash; (QoS_NG)

==Table of Contents==
*[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop/HFSC|HFSC Manual]] &amp;ndash; (QoS 2.5 Ipcop 1.4.8)
#[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop/HFSC#Prerequisites|Prerequisites]]

#[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop/HFSC#Glossary|Glossary]]

*[[Advanced_QoS_for_IPCop/HTB|HTB Manual]] &amp;ndash;  (QoS_NG)

==Notes==
* There are two approaches to limiting unwanted/low priority traffic:
** Creating a rule pinpointing the traffic type with the layer 7 tools or using the specific port and then specifying the maximum bandwidth this traffic will be allowed to have.
** Creating rules for allowable traffic and giving them maximum bandwidth (or known quantities) and then limiting the default rule's bandwidth limiting all unknown traffic.

* The maximum root bandwidth is typically set at 90% of the actual bandwidth to reduce the effect of buffered data in the local modem or on the isp's end.  The problem stems from the idea that requested data can be queued (in large quantities) to avoid gaps in data flow.  While this works for large continuous transfers, mixed data transfers suffer because of having to wait &quot;in queue&quot; to be sent causing the net effect of sluggish response.

* Port ranges can be entered as &lt;port&gt;[space]-[space]&lt;port&gt;.  IE: 1000 - 2000
* IP ranges can be entered as CIDR notation addresses. IE: 192.168.1.0/24

==Questions-N-Answers==
* Q: Where can I download the Advanced QoS for IPCOP?
** A: [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop here]
* Q: What does the QOS &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; really mean?
** A:
* Q: What does the QOS_NG &quot;Maxbust&quot; and &quot;Ceilmaxburst&quot; really mean?
** A:  Burst : Amount of bytes that can be burst at ceil speed, in excess of the configured maximum upload speed. Should be at least as high as the highest burst of all children
Ceilburst: Amount of bytes that can be burst at 'infinite' speed, in other words, as fast as the interface can transmit them. For perfect evening out, should be equal to at most one average packet. Should be at least as high as the highest cburst of all children.
Both values could be empty because they will be computed automatically.
* Q: Which is better QOS(HFSC) or QOS_NG(HTB)?
** A: 
*** QOS which is based on HFSC is supposed to be better for VOIP.  The Hierchial tree method was designed to share bandwidth between branches or classes and rules (envision a tree, the trunk being the full bandwidth, each branch being class/rule taking bandwidth from the trunk).
*** QOS_NG which is based on HTB is supposed to be better at layer 7 (P2P for example) bandwidth control.  The idea behind HTB is that the data flows like water in a hose into &quot;buckets&quot;.  Each bucket only holds so much data.  The buckets are queued by priority to receive the available bandwidth.

==Examples==
===QOS Symmetrical 128Kbps with OpenVPN priority===

* VPN connections are accessing servers on GREEN intranet
* Clients will produce typical web, ftp, etc... traffic
* VPN is the only service available to the internet on RED

''Actions''
* Create RED root classes 199(eth0) and 299(imq0) with the maximum bandwidth set to 115 Kbps
* Create class 100, priority 1, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 25ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 101, priority 2, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 50ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 199, priority 7, minimum bandwidth 1 Kbps, delay 500ms, maximum bandwidth 100 Kbps
* Assign ACK priority to class 100
* Create class 200, priority 1, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 25ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 201, priority 2, minimum bandwidth 50 Kbps, delay 50ms, maximum bandwidth 115 Kbps
* Create class 299, priority 7, minimum bandwidth 1 Kbps, delay 500ms, maximum bandwidth 100 Kbps
At this point all traffic will traverse on the default classes 199 and 299 at a slightly reduced rate.

To ensure that vpn (OpenVPN specifically) traffic gets priority, the following rules should be added:
* Create a rule &quot;OpenVPNOut&quot;, interface eth0, protocol UDP, mark 101, source port 1194
* Create a rule &quot;OpenVPNIn&quot;, interface imq0, protocol UDP, mark 201, source port 1194

This scheme will make OpenVPN traffic higher priority than the default traffic, however since ACK's have a higher priority than everything else, normal traffic will still flow.

Viewing the graphs should provide insight into the flow:
* 1:100 will show ACK traffic from GREEN clients to internet connections
* 1:101 will show VPN outgoing traffic (port 1194)
* 1:199 will show bulk outgoing traffic
* 2:200 will show very little in this configuration as the rule is not used
* 2:201 will show VPN incoming traffic (port 1194)
* 2:299 will show bulk incoming traffic

Additional categorization of the bulk traffic could be done by adding more rules.

== Manual ==
This version of the manual is designed to get you up and running with out any knowledge of traffic shaping

=== Prerequisites ===
Using this version of the manual will allow you to get traffic shaping working on your IPCop firewall with out any knowledge of QoS. You will however need knowledge of the following:

*[[wikipedia:PuTTY|PuTTY]] &amp;ndash; [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ Home Page]
*[[wikipedia:Winscp|Winscp]] &amp;ndash; [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php Home Page]

=== Installation ===



==== Transferring the package to the IPCop router/firewall ====
Once you have a copy now connect to your IPCop machine using winscp, if you are connecting from a windows machine. Although SSH is done over port 22, IPCop uses port 222. Once you have connected to the firewall navigate first to the root of the file system then into the folder marked &quot;tmp&quot;. Once inside transfer the qos tar file that you obtained from Source Forge.

OK, we really need to help people here - I know I spent about a day searching for how to do this and this is roughly correct - use something like:
#if you are using Linux you can use 
scp -v -P 222 /home/downloads/pathtofile/filename root@hostname:/tmp/
 After three hours of wasted time, I found here: http://ipcops.com/faq/ipcop_faq.html#1.2.7
that one has to &quot;enable SSH via the web interface&quot;

#if you are using Windows as your desktop try [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php WinSCP]

==== Unpacking the tar file ====
*Connect to IPCop with PuTTy, remembering to connect using port 222.
**If using linux ssh -l admin -p 222 192.168.1.1
*Navigate to the /tmp folder.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; cd /tmp&lt;/tt&gt;
*Run the following command to extract the tar file.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; tar xvfz qos_ipcop_1.4.8.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt;
==== Installing the package ====
*Goto the extracted files
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; cd /tmp/qos&lt;/tt&gt;
*Run the install script
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;tt&gt; ./install&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Addition: Make sure you run the install from the directory of the installer! i.e.  &quot;./install&quot; and not &quot;qos/install&quot; There is a friendly line at the end of the installer that nukes the current directory. I have just lost my root dir... - benaiah&lt;/code&gt;

===Setting up the Classes (For Outgoing Traffic)===
Using a web browser navigate to your IPCop router/firewall and from there using the &quot;Services&quot; menu, select &quot;QoS&quot;.

====Root Class====
The first thing that needs to be defined is the root class for out going traffic on the red device, this will be either:

*ppp0 - if a PCI ADSL/ISDN MODEM or PPPoE is used
*eth1 - if an external MODEM is used (and you have only 2 interfaces, red and green, this applies to most users)
*ethx - if you have multiple network interfaces, such as blue and orange (red will always be the highest number)


:#First change the default class from the drop down box to 199.
:#Now add your upload speed in kbps to the text box below the default class. The figure you enter here should be 90% of the upload speed limit that your ISP provides you.

::e.g.

::ISP upload speed = 256 kbps&amp;times;90% = 230 kbps.

::So add 230 into the text box.

: 4.Now click save.

====Fast Class (100)====

This is the class that will used to channel relatively time dependent protocols like, MSN, IRC and SSH.

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 100 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 2.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 50 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 40 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; as your upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

====Very Fast Class (101)====

This class is used for RTP data and anything that is very time dependent like online games and VoIP

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 101 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 1.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 90 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 20 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; as your upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

====Bulk Traffic Class (103)====

This class is used for all the traffic that isn't time dependent, traffic like P2P and FTP.

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 103 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 7.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 0 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 150 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; this should be 50-100 Kbps less than the total upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

====Default Class (199)====

This class is used for all the traffic that isn't covered by a rule. i.e. undefined traffic.

#Using the &quot;Add a new class ppp0[eth1]&quot; section, select 199 from the Class drop down box.
#Select the priority as 4.
#Set the &quot;Minimum Upload in kbit&quot; as 0 Kbps.
#Set the &quot;Maximum delay in milliseconds&quot; as 50 ms.
#Set the &quot;Maximum Upload in kbit&quot; this should be 50-100 Kbps less than the total upload speed given by your ISP.
#Click on save.

=== Setting ACK ===
ACK is a part of the TCP protocol, giving ACK packets high priority will speed up all TCP connections. And thus should assigned to the 101 class.

So in the QoS page on the IPCop do the following:

#Go to the &quot;select class for ACK's on ppp0[eth1]&quot; section.
#Select 101 from the drop down box.
#Click on save.

=== Defining the Traffic ===
Now that all the classes have been defined, you now need to choose what traffic goes through which class. This is done using Rules. Rules are either defined using ports or by using the Layer-7 filters.

====Rules - Ports====
Different applications use different port numbers or ranges of port numbers. They also use different packet protocols, such as TCP and UDP. To define a traffic rule you will need to find out what port numbers the application uses and what packet protocol it uses. This information is usual either in the applications manual or in the configuration selection of the application. Failing that [http://www.google.com google] is your friend.
To add a port based rule do the following:

#Goto the &quot;Add rule&quot; section.
#Give the rule a name e.g. the applications name (no spaces are allowed in names, nor greater than 15 characters long).
#Set the interface from the drop down box to that of your red interface.
#Select the protocol type for your application from the protocol drop down box.
#From the mark drop down box select the class you wish this applications data to be tied to. i.e. if it a VoIP set it to class 101.
#Enter the applications port number into the &quot;Source Port&quot; text box. Port numbers can either be single ports or ranges i.e. 80-90.
#Click on save.

====Rules &amp;ndash; Layer-7====
Layer-7 filters allows the identification of protocols independent of port. This is beneficial if you can not predict what ports will be used by users. There is a cost of CPU time, but this is proportional to the flow of network traffic and shouldn't be a problem with a home or office net work on the minimum hardware specification requirements for IPCop.

To add a Layer-7 based rule do the following:

#Goto the &quot;Add l7 rule&quot; section.
#Enter a the name of the protocol in the &quot;Rulename&quot; text box.
#Set the interface from the drop down box to that of your red interface.
#From the &quot;Protocol&quot; dropdown box select the name of the protocol that you wish to control.
#Then from the &quot;Mark&quot; dropdown box select the class that you wish the protocol's traffic to flow through.
#Click on save.

===IMQ &amp;ndash; Setting up Classes and Rules for Incoming Traffic===

Using the imq0 dummy device will allow you to control the priority of downloaded packets, as opposed to the uploaded packets so far looked at.

Setting up this device is much the same as the previous one but with ADSL connections the bandwidth is greater down stream so this needs to be adjusted in the classes.

The setup precedes as before:
#Set the Root Class using the 90% of the available download band width.
#Fast Class (200) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Very Fast Class (201) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Bulk Traffic Class (203) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Default Class (299) &amp;ndash; changing the max. and min. bandwidths to suit.
#Add the required rules for this device using either port rules or Layer-7 filters.

===Uninstalling QoS Addon===
To uninstall just do the following:

#Connect to IPCop with PuTTy, remembering to connect using port 222.
#Type the following in the terminal window
:&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; /var/ipcop/qos/bin/uninstall

=== Kernel Update ===

IPCOP will require an updated kernel in order for the QOS package to work, after the installing QOS,follow this link [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop/download.php?view.175 MHADDONS], and download and install the kernel, following the associated instructions.
A newer kernel version may be available, look through [http://mh-lantech.css-hamburg.de/ipcop/download.php Downloads], under Addons.

This page discusses the binary modulation schemes and &quot;keying&quot;.

== What is &quot;Keying?&quot; ==

Square waves, sinc waves, and raised-cosine rolloff waves are all well and good, but all of them have drawbacks. If we use an optimal, matched filter, we can eliminate the effect of jitter, so frankly, why would we consider square waves at all? Without jitter as a concern, it makes no sense to correct for jitter, or even take it into consideration. However, since the matched filter needs to look at individual symbols, the transmitted signal can't suffer from any intersymbol interference either. Therefore, we aren't using the sinc pulse.

Since the raised-cosine roll-off wave suffers from both these problems (in smaller amounts, however), we don't want to use that pulse either.

So the question is, what other types of pulses can we send?

It turns out that if we use some of the techniques we have developed using analog signal modulation, and implement a sinusoidal carrier wave, we can create a signal with no inter-symbol interference, very low bandwidth, and no worries about jitter. Just like analog modulation, there are 3 aspects of the carrier wave that we can change: the amplitude, the frequency, and the phase angle. Instead of &quot;modulation&quot;, we call these techniques '''keying''' techniques, because they are operating on a binary-number basis.

There is one important point to note before continuing with this discussion: Binary signals '''are not''' periodic signals. Therefore, we cannot expect that a binary signal is going to have a discrete spectra like a periodic squarewave will have. For this reason, the spectral components of binary data are continuous spectra.


== Amplitude Shift Keying ==

In an ASK system, we are changing the amplitude of the sine wave to transmit digitial data. We have the following cases:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A_1 \sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A_0 \sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

The simplest modulation scheme sets A0 = 0V (turning the transmitter off), and setting A1 = +5V (any random non-zero number turns the transmitter on). This special case of ASK is called OOK (On-Off keying). Morse code uses OOK.

Another common special case of ASK sets A1 to some positive number, and A0 to the corresponding negative number A0 = -A1. We will mention this case again later.

In ASK, we have the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;a(t) \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

by the principal of duality, multiplication in the time domain becomes convolution in the frequency domain, and vice-versa. Therefore, our frequency spectrum will have the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;A(j\omega) * \delta(t - \omega)&lt;/math&gt;

where the impulse function is the fourier-transform of the sinusoid, centered at the frequency of the wave. the value for A is going to be a sinc wave, with a width dependant on the bitrate. We remember from the [[Signals and Systems]] book that convolution of a signal with an impulse is that signal centered where the impulse was centered. Therefore, we know now that the frequency domain shape of this curve is a sinc wave centered at the carrier frequency.

== Frequency Shift Keying ==

In '''Frequency Shift Keying''' (FSK), we can logically assume that the parameter that we will be changing is the frequency of the sine wave. FSK is unique among the different keying methods in that data is never transmitted ''at'' the carrier frequency, but is instead transmitted at a certain offset from the carrier frequency. If we have a carrier frequency of &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;, and a frequency offset of &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;, we can transmit binary values as such:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A \sin ((f_c + \Delta f)t)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A \sin ((f_c - \Delta f)t)&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to ASK, we have FSK, which uses 2 different frequencies to transmit data. For now we will call them &lt;math&gt;\omega1, \omega2&lt;/math&gt;. Using the same logic that we used above, the fourier representations of these waves will be (respectively):

:&lt;math&gt;A_1(j\omega) * \delta(t - \omega1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_0(j\omega) * \delta(t - \omega2)&lt;/math&gt;

With one sinc wave centered at the first frequency, and one sinc wave centered at the second frequency. Notice that A1 and A0 are the half-square waves associated with the 1s and the 0s, respectively. These will be described later.



=== Error Rate ===

The BER of coherent QPSK in the presence of gaussian and Rayleigh noise is as follows:

:{| border=1
|-
| Gaussian Noise || Rayleigh Fading
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc} \left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_0}{2 + \gamma_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Phase Shift Keying ==

PSK systems are slightly different then ASK and FSK systems, and because of this difference, we can exploit an interesting little trick of trigonometry. PSK is when we vary the phase angle of the wave to transmit different bits. For instance:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \phi_1)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \phi_0)&lt;/math&gt;

If we evenly space them out around the unit-circle, we can give ourselves the following nice values:

*Binary 1: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + 0)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 0: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, according to trigonometry, we have the following identity:

&lt;math&gt;\sin(f_c t + \pi) = -\sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

So in general, our equations for each signal (s) is given by:

*&lt;math&gt;s_1(t) = A\sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;s_0(t) = -A\sin(f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

Which looks awfully like an ASK signal. Therefore, we can show that the spectrum of a PSK signal is the same as the spectrum of an ASK signal.

There are two commonally used forms of Phase Shift keying Modulation:

Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)

Binary Phase Shift keying is set out above.

===QPSK===

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying utilises the fact that a cosine wave is in quadrature to a sine wave, allowing 2 bits to be simultaneously represented.

*Binary 11: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + 0) + \cos(f_c+\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 10: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + 0) + \cos(f_c -\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 01: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \pi) + + \cos(f_c+\pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;
*Binary 00: &lt;math&gt;A \sin(f_c t + \pi) + + \cos(f_c - \pi/2)&lt;/math&gt;

QPSK has the advantage over BPSK of requiring half the transmission band width for the same data rate, and error probability.

=== Error Rate ===

The BER of coherent BPSK in the presence of gaussian and Rayleigh noise is as follows:

:{| border=1
|-
| Gaussian Noise || Rayleigh Fading
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc} \left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\gamma_0}{1 + \gamma_0}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Um, no? Length, mass and tension. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_string Vibrating string] --[[Special:Contributions/81.224.39.148|81.224.39.148]] ([[User talk:81.224.39.148|talk]]) 03:32, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

This section could use one other partial method (as most people view this on computers that have sound cards &amp; speakers), using Winamp or the UNIX equivalent XMMS. pure tones can be played from them (like A440) so you can tune by ear. 'tone://440' is the syntax used for such (without quotes). -anon

I have merged the content from [[Guitar:Tuning the strings|Tuning the strings]] to this page and deleted the link on the main page to the old article.
--[[User:NickPenguin|NickPenguin]] 08:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

The article writes &quot;A perfectly tuned A string resonates at a frequency of 440 hertz.&quot; but isn't the guitar 'A' one octave below the 440 hz A? So it would be 220 HZ [[User:62.194.16.204|62.194.16.204]] 17:12, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

Please explain better how the diagrams work.

Added fith fret method to tuning by ear section, just small but I thought i'd mention it.

--[[User:Michael Campbell|Michael Campbell]] 15:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC) Michael Campbell

The A on the 5th fret of the high E string is 440Hz.
The A string is 2 octaves lower than this (there's another A on the second fret of the B string).
This means the A string is really 110Hz. But maybe you can listen to a 440Hz sound to tune this string too.

== Placeholder for removed material from this section ==

I've removed a big chunk of material and have pasted it here for later inclusion into the correct section on Amps.

&lt;u&gt;MATERIAL REMOVED:&lt;/u&gt;

==Amplifier setup==
Unless your amplifier only has the preamp control, you have many other knobs you can play with to make your guitar sound great. Before you begin setting up your amp, you should always make sure that you:

#Set all the volume knobs and gains to its lowest setting.
#Set the guitar volume to the lowest setting, and plug it into the amplifier. Always plug in before you turn the amp on, so you do not make it &quot;pop&quot;.
#Turn on the amplifier. If it is a tube-based model and has the standby switch, throw it to standby mode too, to warm up the tubes.
##If it's a tube base model, Wait at least 15 seconds; optimally you should give it 5 minutes, especially for the large amplifiers. Otherwise skip to next part.
##If you have a passive pickup, plug into &quot;high&quot; plug. If you have an active pickup, plug into &quot;low&quot;. If you have only one plug, just plug it in.

After this, there are three main ways that have been used.

Method 1:
#Bring the guitar's volume knob somewhere between low volume and medium. Play a chord
#Begin to bring amplifier master volume up (if you have one), then channel volume, then gain up, to 5. This should be your basis for setting up. If it's too loud, bring down the volume, and if not enough distortion, bring up the gain.

Method 2:
#Bring the amplifier's gain and volume to 11
#Tweak the volume with the guitar volume knob. If there are too much distortion bring down the gain.

Method 3:
#Bring the guitar volume knob to its max.
#Gradually bring up the volume on the amplifier. You should not need to bring it above 2.
#Bring up the gain; bring down the volume when needed.

Aside from the gain and volume setting, you may want to tweak the EQ settings. Here's a few samples:
*Clean: Clean channel; Gain 1-5; bass 5, mid 5, treble 5
*Blues: Overdrive channel; Gain 5; bass 7, mid 3, treble 5
*Metal: Overdrive channel; Gain 11; bass 11; mid 2; treble 7

When you have finish playing, turn all the knobs to the lowest settings first. If it's a tube amplifier, you may even need to let it cool down (either on standby or just on) for another 5 minutes.

==Tremolo Bar torque==
One of the first things you will have to set up on electric guitar, especially if you find the tremolo bar keeps falling toward the ground. There are a few different methods.
*On a low end models like Squier Stratocaster, you just need to screw in the tremolo bar, by rotating the bar clockwise, Until it tightens up. The problem with model is that you do not have much control on the bar's position during playing.
*On other models, that you merely plug in the whammy bar, you may have a capscrew, which you insert the bar through it into the bridge. Afterward, screw it in until tighten. 
*Another approach for the plug-in whammy is to tighten with an Allen Key hole, nearby the bar's hole on the bridge. The instruction booklet will usually explain where it is, and how to tighten it.
Ideally you want the bar at a 45 degree angle toward the ground, allowing it to be easily grabbed.

== A few questions on the text ==

I'd like to take a run at simplifying some of the language here.  The content is largely fine, at least on first reading.  There are some places, though, where the sentences are over-long, and a few where attempts to keep it brief seem to go to extremes, omitting prepositions, for instance, that might clarify what's said.

I don't want to step on any toes, however, so I'm asking first.  (Also, I'm a bit confused whether this sort of conversation should take place here or in the Staff lounge?)

A few content questions:

Is there a simpler, more accurate way of saying just where Ancient Greece was located?  I've tended to consider it more as the coastal areas and the many islands of the Aegean and Ionian Seas.  This at times also included (as the map shows) parts of present-day Turkey.

Wasn't Alexander regarded more as Macedonian?  Granted, Macedonia was a city-state, but Alexander's rule came in a period when the other city-states were exceedingly weak.  Is there room to cover the major subcultures, or perhaps to treat on the major periods of Ancient Greek civilization here?  Would this serve the interests of clarity without making the section excessively detailed or confusing for the 8-12 year-old target reader?

Also, it seems to me that there are significant differences between British and American texts and tutelage, particularly where Ancient Greece (and Ancient Greek and Latin languages) are concerned.  At least I recall my own shock in college intro Greek at using a British textbook aimed at something equivalent to an American middle school level, which is roughly the age group we are supposed to gear this text towards?  

Is there a concensus on this issue (British vs. American school children) in discussions elsewhere that I haven't happened across in my brief time here, so far?

In any case: Athenian, Spartan and Macedonian cultures were each quite different from one another, even if they do all fall under the general heading of Ancient Greece.  Is there some concensus on how deep this section should delve into such differences?  

Obviously I'm asking these question in the hopes of stimulating some discussion that might lead to a reasonable consensus on the scope of this particular article.  Hope I haven't offended. --[[User:Ebbixx|bud]] 03:14, 23 January 2007 (UTC) (revisited [[User:Ebbixx|bud]] 03:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC))</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A fairly easy way to drastically improve the look of some watches is to replace worn or missing lume from the hands.  This works with slotted hands

Required tools:

Toothpicks

Paint or lume compound

Something to hold a toothpick (blob of clay, Rodico or a hole)


You may want to remove the old paint, especially if you are using lume paint rather than plain. If the watch is very old, make sure it does not contain radium, a poisonous radioactive material.   If the dial says ra anywhere, if the paint looks brown, or if the crystal has shadows of the hands it probably contains radium.  Radium is relatively safe if contained inside the watch case, but dangerous if breathed or swallowed.  

Place the hands upside down on the toothpick, hour hand first. 
 
[[Image:Hands2321.jpg]]


In this case, I did not clean the old paint off, since it was mostly intact. 


Mix the paint as required for the appropriate color and texture.  It should be reasonably thick, but still liquid rather than paste.  I used several colors of acrylic here, trying to duplicate the original as closely as possible.
  
[[Image:Watchhandspaint.jpg]]

With the clean end of a toothpick, pick up a small amount of paint. Drag the paint across the back of the hand in the slot area.  This should leave a film of paint, and the front side should look clean and even.

Let dry

== This is a wikipedia article ==

This is an encyclopedic definition of bodybuilding, not a book on bodybuilding. There are a number of interesting things that everybody could write about here that wouldn't belong on wikipedia. One of them is advice-how-to sorts of things. 
I know that there's a specific way that one is supposed to breathe when lifting freeweights for instance, that would be very useful, and good exercises for tone and the combination of aerobic and strength training exercises.
That kind of thing.

Wild cats are some of Earth's grandest treasures, and their stories excite the imagination of children of all ages.  Many of these cats are endangered, and the children who will one day assume responsibility for these animals should be able to learn what they can about their lives.  After all, we appreciate what we understand, and save what we appreciate.  The importance of this task has led many experts here at Wikibooks to donate their time and talents to bring this volume together.

Wikibooks is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, aimed at providing free, easily available quality reading for adults and children to promote the global spread of knowledge.  Traditional publishing houses make the bulk of their income from re-issues of classic books, new books by authors with long track records, or celebrities who are famous in their own right.  The chances of a truly good new work being published solely on the basis of merit skyrocket when you overturn the traditional business model and tap the wellspring of new talent out there using the 'net.&lt;!-- is this editorializing on other forms of publishing necessary?  Bfpage--&gt;

With this project we have reached a crossroad between the books of yesterday, and the encyclopedia of everything for tomorrow.  Simply by reading this book and telling your friends, you have advanced the cause of free access to information and of democratizing the field of publishing.  Thank you, and once again, welcome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Snowflakes, Fingerprints, and Assignments ==
Writing assignments in college differ as much as instructors. There is no one guidebook, approach, or set of rules that college teachers will consult when putting together their coursework. Since each assignment will always be unique, it is important to devote time to thoroughly understanding what is being asked of you before beginning. Don't wait until the night before the work is due to begin asking questions and delving in. The sooner you understand and approach the assignment's requirements, the less time you will spend second-guessing (and needlessly revising) your writing.

== Analyzing an Assignment ==

You will likely encounter many different kinds of writing assignments in college, and it would be nearly impossible to list all of them. However, regardless of genre, there are some basic strategies one can use to approach these assignments constructively.

* '''Read the assignment sheet early and thoroughly.'''  An assignment sheet may be lengthy, but resist the temptation to skim it. Observe and interpret every detail of the text. Moreover, it is essential to focus on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keywords key words] of the subject matter being discussed. It would be unfortunate to hand in an incomplete or misguided assignment because you did not properly read and understand the guidelines. Since you can easily overlook details on the first reading, read the assignment sheet a second time.  As you are reading, highlight areas where you have questions, and also mark words you feel are particularly important. Ask yourself why your professor has given this assignment. How does it relate to what you are studying in class? Pay attention to key words, such as ''compare'', ''contrast'', ''analyze'', etc. Who is your audience? Should the paper be written in a formal or informal tone? Is there documentation required? If a specific number of sources are required, how many must be books vs. online sources? What type of citation is called for: APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.? Is there a page or word count minimum/maximum? Are you required to submit a draft before the final copy? Will there be peer review?
* '''Get answers to your questions.'''  After thoroughly reading the assignment sheet, you might not have questions right away. However, after reading it again, either before or or after you try to start the assignment, you might find that you have questions. Don't play a guessing game when it comes to tackling assignment criteria--ask the right person for help: the instructor. Discuss any and all questions with the person who assigned the work, either in person or via email. Visit him or her during office hours or stay after class. Do not wait until the last minute, as doing so puts your grade at risk. Don't be shy about asking your professors questions. Not only will you better your understanding and the outcome of your paper, but professors tend to enjoy and benefit from student inquiry, as questions help them rethink their assignments and improve the clarity of their expectations. You likely are not the only student with a question, so be the one who is assertive and responsible enough to get answers. In the worst case scenario, when you have done all of these things and a professor still fails to provide you with the clarity you are looking for, discuss your questions with fellow classmates.
* '''Writing Centers.'''  Many colleges and universities have a writing center. Tutors are helpful consultants for reviewing writing assignments both before and after you begin. If you feel somewhat confident about what you need to include in your writing assignment, bring your completed outline and/or the first draft of your paper together with your assignment sheet. Tutors can also review your final draft before its submission to your professor. Many writing centers allow you to make appointments online for convenience and may also have &quot;walk-in&quot; availability. It is a good idea to check out the available options a week or so in advance of when you will actually need the appointment, or even longer if it will be during mid-term or finals week. 
* '''Create a timeline.'''  Set due dates for yourself, whether they be to have a topic picked or a whole rough draft completed. Procrastination rarely results in a good paper. Some school libraries offer helpful computer programs that can create an effective assignment timeline for you. This is a helpful option for new, inexperienced writers who have not yet learned the art of analyzing assignments, and who are not familiar with the amount of time that is required for the college writing process. Remember, late papers may or may not be accepted by your instructor, and even if they are your grade will likely be reduced. Don't sell yourself short with late submissions.

==Prewriting and Brainstorming==
[[File:Prewriting Analysis.jpg|thumb|Prewriting Analysis]]

Every writing assignment from every discipline requires the formulation of complex ideas. Thus, once the assignment guidelines have been thoroughly considered, you should begin to explore how you plan structure your work in order to meet them. While this is often considered to be the start of the writing process, it is also an essential part of assignment analysis, as it is here that the assignment is broken down into the most digestible parts. Such a process can be done either individually or in a group, depending on the situation.

* '''Prewriting.'''  The first and foremost stage of the individual writing process is that of Prewriting. Often overlooked by inexperienced writers, this is essentially the architectural stage of the writing/analysis process, where the foundations of an assignment are first laid out and constructed. ''Free-writing'', ''outlining'', ''diagramming'', and ''mapping'' are all possible approaches to this stage of development, where the goal is to organize one's ideas around the requirements of the task at hand. Many people begin this right on the assignment sheet, as it can be helpful to highlight what the instructor is specifically asking for while simultaneously adding one's own understanding to the ideas. Eventually though, you will want to move to a separate page. If you are ''free-writing'', you should start by writing out an assignment related question or main concept, and then proceed to freely (with or without punctuation or formality) write anything that comes to mind in relation to it. If you are ''outlining'', you are essentially breaking down the main ideas of the assignment and your response to them in a linear format (by paragraph, subject, section, subsection etc.). If you are ''diagramming'', your prewriting can take many different forms, but always as a visual representation of your response to some/all of the assignment constituents. Lastly, if you are ''mapping'', you are essentially ''outlining'' in a more visual way, using both linear and non-linear representation to organize your ideas about the assignment. ''Research'' can also be conducted during this stage of the writing/analysis process, as it is sometimes helpful to know more about a topic before you make the commitment to writing about it. You may even choose to use more than one of these approaches if you find it helpful in developing your understanding of the assignment.

* '''Brainstorming.'''  Similar to prewriting, brainstorming takes place in the space between analysis and drafting, the difference being that brainstorming generally involves group discussion. The size of a brainstorming group varies according to task, but ideally consists of smaller odd numbers (3, 5, or 7) when there is no assigned mediator present. There are obviously many pitfalls to such group discussion, and many divergent possibilities (distractions, freeloading, repetition, etc.) that can lead to counter-productivity. Nonetheless, if all members are devoted to the task of analysis and development, the variety of perspectives can prove to be most rewarding. If all goes well, each member of the group takes turns posing questions related to the assignment being discussed, to which the other members respond openly and freely. When positive attitudes and constructive criticism can manage to be maintained, each member of the group will have his or her own critical thinking expanded upon and enriched by the understanding of the other group members.

==Sample Assignments==

As discussed earlier, instructors will come up with any number of assignments, most of which will stress different types of composition. In each section below, there are sample assignment directions and suggestions on how to proceed. What follows is not meant to be a comprehensive list of assignments, but rather a short list of the most common assignments you can expect to see in an introductory English course. Many assignments not listed here are simply creative variations of these basic directives. For example, you could approach a visual analysis the same way you would a rhetorical analysis; an argument paper is similar to a research paper, perhaps with a shorter argument. The techniques you use in writing a narrative can also translate into writing a short story or observational essay.  

===Research Paper===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= For this paper, you will take a position on a topic of either local or national interest. Research the topic thoroughly, making sure you know all sides of the debate, and decide what your position will be.

Your task is to write an 8 to 10 page research paper convincing your audience of your point of view. You are required to use at least 8 sources, 4 of which should be scholarly (peer reviewed). You will use MLA format for your in-text citations and Works Cited page. Remember, the key to a good debate is knowing the opposition. Therefore, some of your sources and paper should be dedicated to such. Use this as an opportunity to show how your viewpoint is conclusive.|caption=}}


You will likely have to write a research paper of a significant length during college. Students are usually overwhelmed by the page count and the struggle to come up with a paper topic. Sometimes, in an attempt to make sure he or she reaches the page minimum, students choose very broad research categories like welfare or the death penalty. Believe it or not, these extensive topics generally do not make for great papers, simply because there is too much information to cover. Narrow topics allow for more in-depth research and writing. Choosing a topic takes time and research, so don't be surprised if your instructor requires your topic ahead of time. This is to make sure you do not leave all of your research until the last minute. Look online for topics that interest you and write down a few notes about what is going on in that field. Since a research paper generally involves an argument, you must pick a topic that has two sides. One-sided, fact-based arguments such as &quot;smoking is bad for your health,&quot; are not suitable for research papers.

Look at the assignment sheet for key words. What is the purpose of the paper? To argue. What are your requirements? Not only are there page requirements, but also source requirements. What are scholarly sources? How do you judge the credibility of a source? Are you familiar with MLA?

There is one mistake that is very easy to make: confusing an argumentative research paper with an expository one. Don't let your argumentative research paper become an informational report where you simply list information on a topic (expository writing). Unless explicitly stated, that is not your assignment.

===Narrative===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=A narrative can be defined as a story or account of an experience or event. Think of a moment or experience that you found to be particularly important, meaningful, humorous, etc., and describe this event. Events do not have to be extraordinary large or dramatic to be important and fun to read--a snapshot of what happened while you were sitting at a stoplight can be just as entertaining as a story about being in a tornado.|caption=}}


Narratives are a favorite first assignment for instructors, as it is assumed that most people find it easiest to write about what they are familiar with. At the same time, the idea of self-reflective writing can be very intimidating. Most students have fantastic stories to tell, but inevitably edit themselves too early by worrying that their stories might not be &quot;important&quot; enough.

However, the assignment clearly states that you should not worry about your narrative concerning a large event. One of the key words is &quot;describe.&quot; Therefore, the most important part of the assignment is your use of description (&quot;show, don't tell&quot;). Prewrite and describe a few ideas you might want to talk about. Pick one of them and start writing down as many descriptive details as you can think of about the event. Who were you with? Where were you? What was the weather like? What did the building look like? What were you thinking? How did you feel? What did you learn? Recording these concrete details will help guide you through your narrative. Don't forget to include as many sensory perceptions (taste, touch, sight, sound, and smell) as possible to paint the clearest picture of what you are trying to describe to your reader.

At this point, you still might be worried about the &quot;importance&quot; of the story. While it is true that your story should come to some sort of point, themes usually develop naturally in a story. If you begin your story with an agenda, you'll often find yourself describing the theme and not the event itself. Allow the themes to develop, and do not try to force them unto the page.

===Rhetorical Analysis===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=A rhetorical analysis calls for students to closely read a text and determine several characteristics about it (author, context, purpose, emotional appeal/effects, etc). For this assignment, you will read &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; by Jonathan Swift and write a rhetorical analysis. Remember, this is not a reflection piece, but rather a deep look at the tone, style, and intended audience, as well as ethos, logos, and pathos.|caption=}}

At first, a rhetorical analysis sounds somewhat difficult. However, analyzing just means making a conscious effort to read each word carefully and think about what the author is doing. The first step would be to read the piece, not once, but two or three times. Highlight important passages and take notes. For this assignment, the instructor wanted students to write about ethos, logos, and pathos, which are rhetorical terms you should become familiar with. Pay attention to specific word choices that may evoke emotion, or any facts the author may have put forward in the text. Look at the background of the author as well as the time period in which he or she was writing. Consider the tone of the piece. Is it formal/informal/serious/humorous? These are all things to keep in mind while reading. Make an ongoing list of the author's rhetorical techniques that you may want to discuss in your paper.

Remember to be mindful of your essay's organization. It is easy to discuss three different topics in one paragraph and jump back and forth from one idea to the next, but this makes it difficult for your reader to follow. Also, do not forget that this is not a reflection. For this assignment, the instructor isn't concerned with your reaction to the text, or your ability to summarize; he or she wants to gauge your analytical skills.

===Summary/Response Paper===

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Read Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail.&quot; Give a brief summary of the article and a response. Cite specific examples and avoid generalizations.|caption=}}

Before writing a summary, it is important to use your critical reading skills. First, read the article carefully. It might help to write down the main point of each paragraph in the margin next to it. Next, reread the article and look carefully for the main points the author is trying to get across. Look for things the author states explicitly, as well as what is implied by things that are not clearly stated. Look for any biases or missing information. Ask yourself questions while you read, such as &quot;what is the big picture here? What is the author really trying to get across with this or that example?&quot; The title will often provide a clue about the author's main point. Most of all, slow down and take the time to reread the article several times. In summarizing an article, think about how you would explain its message to someone who hasn't read it. What are the main points of the piece? What is necessary to know about the work in order to understand it? 

While writing a summary is a familiar assignment from grade school, in college, summaries are no longer enough, and instructors will frequently require a response. Writing a response is giving your opinion about the text. However, statements such as &quot;I did/did not like it&quot; are not sufficient. Not only must you be more descriptive with your opinions, but you need to support them. If you do not think that an author provided enough information to prove his or her point, state the specific flaws and what could be done to improve them. The same rule applies for any emotions felt while reading the text. Instead of just saying the writing made you sad, point out a specific passage in the text that made you feel that way. Talk about the word choices the author used and how that affected your reading.  

It is important to note the word &quot;brief&quot; in the assignment sheet. The instructor does not want a two-page summary and then a paragraph of reflection. Your response should take up the bulk of the paper.

==Finishing the Assignment==

Remember, no matter what the assignment, identifying key words in guidelines can help you determine what type of thinking and ability the professor wants you to demonstrate. The following six areas of competencies are from Bloom's Taxonomy. To learn more, visit: http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/style/taxonomy.htm. 
*'''Knowledge''':  This becomes evident in how well you remember the subject matter, such as the major ideas, dates, places, events, etc. Questions may begin with: Identify, describe, examine, when, where, who.
*'''Comprehension''': How well you understand the information presented. Can you describe the information in your own words? Questions may begin with: Interpret, contrast, predict, discuss.
*'''Application''':  Can you use the principles learned to solve other problems in different situations?  Questions may begin with: Illustrate, examine, modify, experiment, relate.
*'''Analysis''': Can you recognize hidden meanings, see patterns, identify the underlying parts? Questions may begin with: Separate, order, connect, classify, divide, explain.
*'''Synthesis''':  Can you relate knowledge from different areas to draw conclusions? Questions may begin with: Modify, rearrange, substitute, design, invent, generalize.
*'''Evaluation''': This involves verifying the value of the evidence when solving controversies, developing opinions, etc.  Questions may begin with: Decide, convince, select, compare, summarize.

If you need clarification on what your instructor is looking for, do not hesitate to ask. After you have finished your paper, be sure to double-check that you have fulfilled all the requirements. Proofread your paper multiple times before handing in the final copy.

&quot;Many cases of people improving their singing ability has shown this: sure, you might not be capable of becoming the next ''Britney Spears'' ...&quot; 
&lt;br /&gt;Hah.
&lt;br /&gt;It would make sense to me to site someone who is actually skillful and respected within the music world. Maybe Pavarotti? Maybe even Mariah Carey. I don't really know the &quot;who's&quot; of the singing arena, but I start to question whether the book actually has any merit when I read Britney Spears as a pinnacle of achievement in terms of ability.

This is awful. If ever a project could destroy itself before it got off the ground, this one is trying, ''really trying'' to. Please see [[Wikibooks:Neutral_point_of_view]] and note that Wikibook's has high standards, this project simply just doesn't meet any of them. Don't think this should be an easy ride to your ideal of what singing is. POV is not allowed here either.--[[User:I'll bring the food|I&amp;#39;ll bring the food]] 23:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

It will be mentioned here, but also probably in every sub-chapter of this section that the intention of these chapters, much less of the entire book, that the purpose of this is '''not to teach network programming'''. What these chapters do aim to do is provide a fast and dirty listing of available functions, and demonstrate how they coincide with our previous discussions on networking. For further information on the subject, the reader is encouraged to check out networking concepts on the programming bookshelf.

This page is not designed to be an in-depth discussion of C socket programming. Instead, this page would like to be a quick-and-dirty overview of C, in the interests of reinforcing some of the networking concepts discussed earlier. 

== C and Unix ==

This section will (briefly) discuss how to program socket applications using the C programming language in a UNIX environment. The next section will then discuss the differences between socket programming under Windows, and will explain how to port socket code from UNIX to Windows platforms.

== C and Windows (Winsock) ==

Programming sockets in Windows is nearly identical to programming sockets in UNIX, except that windows requires a few different additions:

#Use &lt;Winsock.h&gt;
#Link to ws2_32.dll
#Initialize Winsock with WSAStartup( )

The first 2 points are self-explanatory, and are actually dependant on your compiler, which we will not go into here. However, the 3rd point needs a little explaining. We need to initialize winsock before we can use any of the socket functions (or else they will all return errors). To initialize, we must create a new data object, and pass it to the initialization routine:

 WSADATA wd;

And we must pass a pointer to this structure, along with the requested version number for winsock to the function:

 WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 0), &amp;wd);

The MAKEWORD macro takes two numbers, a major version number (the 2, above), and a minor version number (the 0, above). For instance, to use Winsock2.0, we use MAKEWORD(2, 0). To use Winsock1.1, we use MAKEWORD(1, 1).

Also, it is important to note that Windows does not allow sockets to be read and written using the generic unix '''read( )''' and '''write( )''' functions. In windows, you should instead use the '''recv( )''' and '''send( )''' functions. Also, people who are familiar with windows should know that windows treats sockets as an I/O handle, so they can also be accessed with the Windows generic read/write functions '''ReadFile( )''' and '''WriteFile( )'''.

Winsock, and windows in general also have a number of other functions available in winsock.dll, but also in other dlls (like wininet.dll) that will facilitate higher-level internet operations.

== Other Socket Implementations ==

== Further Reading ==

== Introduction ==

People are prone to take for granted the fact that modern technology allows us to transmit data at nearly the speed of light to locations that are very far away. 200 years ago, it would be deemed preposterous to think that we could transmit webpages from China to Mexico in less than a second. It would seem equally preposterous to think that people with cellphones could be talking to each other, clear as day, from miles away. Today, these things are so common, that we accept them without even asking how these miracles are possible.

=== What is Communications? ===

Communications is the field of study concerned with the transmission of information through various means.  It can also be defined as technology employed in transmitting messages.  It can also be defined as the inter-transmitting the content of data (speech, signals, pulses etc.) from one node to another.

==To Whom is This Book For? ==

This book is for people who have read the [[Signals and Systems]] wikibook, or an equivalent source of the information. Topics considered in this book will rely heavily on knowledge of Fourier Domain representation and the Fourier Transform. This book can be used to accompany a number of different classes spanning the 3rd and fourth years in a study of electrical engineering. Knowledge of integral and differential calculus is assumed. The reader may benefit from knowledge of such topics as semiconductors, electromagnetic wave propagation, etc., although these topics are not necessary to read and understand the information in this book.

== What will this Book Cover ==

This book is going to take a look at nearly all facets of electrical communications, from the shape of the electrical signals, to the issues behind massive networks. It makes little sense to be discussing these subjects outside the realm of current examples. We have the Internet, so in discussing issues concerning digital networks, it makes good sense to reference these issues to the Internet. Likewise, this book will attempt to touch on, at least briefly, every major electrical communications network that people deal with on a daily basis. From AM radio to the Internet, from DSL to cable TV, this book will attempt to show how the concepts discussed apply to the real world.

This book also acknowledges a simple point: It is easier to discuss the signals ''and'' the networks simultaneously. For this kind of task to be undertaken in a paper book would require hundreds, if not thousands of printed pages, but through the miracle of Wikimedia, all this information can be brought together in a single, convenient location.

This book would like to actively solicit help from anybody who has experience with any of these concepts: Computer Engineers, Communications Engineers, Computer Programmers, Network Administrators, IT Professionals. Also, this book may cover all these topics, but the reader doesn't need to have prior knowledge of all these disciplines to advance. Information will be developed as completely as possible in the text, and links to other information sources will be provided as needed.

== Where to Go From Here ==

Since this book is designed for a junior and senior year of study, there aren't necessarily many topics that will logically follow this book. After reading and understanding this material, the next logical step for the interested engineer is either industry or graduate school. Once in graduate school, there are a number of different areas to concentrate study in. In industry, the number is even higher.

== Division of Material ==

Admittedly, this is a very large topic, one that can span not only multiple printed books, but also multiple bookshelves. It could then be asked &quot;Why don't we split this book into 2 or more smaller books?&quot; This seems like a good idea on the surface, but you have to consider exactly where the division would take place. Some would say that we could easily divide the information between &quot;Analog and Digital&quot; lines, or we could divide up into &quot;Signals and Systems&quot; books, or we could even split up into &quot;Transmissions and Networks&quot; Books. But in all these possible divisions, we are settling for having related information in more than 1 place. 

=== Analog and Digital ===

It seems most logical that we divide this material along the lines of analog information and digital information. After all, this is a &quot;digital world&quot;, and aspiring communications engineers should be able to weed out the old information quickly and easily. However, what many people don't realize is that digital methods are simply a subset of analog methods with more stringent requirements. Digital transmissions are done using techniques perfected in analog radio and TV broadcasts. Digital computer modems are sending information over the old analog phone networks. Digital transmissions are analyzed using analog mathematical concepts such as modulation, SNR (signal to noise ratio), Bandwidth, Frequency Domain, etc... For these reasons, we can simplify both discussions by keeping them in the same book.

=== Signals and Systems ===

Perhaps we should divide the book in terms of the signals that are being sent, and the systems that are physically doing the sending. This makes some sense, except that it is impossible to design an appropriate signal without understanding the restrictions of the underlying network that it will be sent on. Also, once we develop a signal, we need to develop transmitters and receivers to send them, and those are physical systems as well.


===''Systems'' Approach===

It is a bit confusing to be writing a book about ''Communication System''s and also considering the '''pedagogical''' ''Systems Approach''. Although using the same word, they are not quite the same thing.

This approach is almost identical to the description above (Signals &amp; Systems) except that it is not limited to the consideration of signals (common in many university texts), but can include other technological drivers (codecs, lasers, and other components).

In this case we give a brief overview of different communication systems (voice, data, cellular, satellite etc.) so that students will have a context in which to place the more detailed (and often generic) information. Then we can then zoom in on the mathematical and technological details to see how these systems do their magic. This lends itself quite well to technical subjects since the basic systems (or mathematics) change relatively slowly, but the underlying technology can offen change rapidly and take unexpected terns. 

I would like to suggest that the table of contents in this book be rearranged to reflect this pedagogical approach: Systems examples first, followed by the details.


===Why would anyone want to study (tele)communications?===

Telecommunications is an alluring industry with a provocative history filled with eccentric personalities: Bell, Heavyside, Kelvin, Brunel and many others. It is fraught with adventure and danger: adventure spanning space and time; danger ranging from the remote depths of the ocean floor to deep space, from the boardrooms of AT&amp;T to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Telecommunications has been heralded as a modern Messiah and cursed as a pathetic sham. It has created and destroyed empires and institutions. It has proclaimed the global village while sponsoring destructive nationalism. It has come to ordinary people, but has remained largely in the control of the ‘media’ and even 'big brother'. Experts will soon have us all traveling down a techno-information highway, destination — unknown.

Telecommunications has become the lifeblood of modern civilization. Besides all that, there’s big bucks in it

[[w:UNIX|UNIX]] is a computer operating system that was first developed during the 1960s and 1970s at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. It was originally conceived as an academic operating system, particularly at the university level, and hence security was not a top priority of the design. Since then, however, UNIX computing systems have been made more widely available and have become an essential part of networking and internet infrastructure. The increased level of access and the need for data security have driven improvements to UNIX security features. The evolution of UNIX security features continues to this day, with an increasingly urgent need for preventing inappropriate access to systems and their data.

This book is intended for an audience that has at least a basic familiarity with the UNIX operating system, including common shell commands, the directory structure, and file manipulation. The primary focus will be for the System Administrator of a UNIX system. That is the operator who is responsible for configuring and maintaining a functioning system, as well as troubleshooting system failures, controlling user access to the system, and so forth.

As there are multiple variations of the UNIX operating system made available by various computing vendors, not to mention related operating systems such as Linux, this book will cover topics common to most of the UNIX releases. Features specific to a particular vendor's release will be noted accordingly.

== Receiver Design ==

It turns out that if we know what kind of signal to expect, we can better receive those signals. This should be intuitive, because it is hard to find something if we don't know what precisely we are looking for. How is a receiver supposed to know what is data and what is noise, if it doesnt know what data looks like?

Coherent transmissions are transmissions where the receiver knows what type of data is being sent. Coherency implies a strict timing mechanism, because even a data signal may look like noise if you look at the wrong part of it. In contrast, noncoherent receivers don't know exactly what they are looking for, and therefore noncoherent communication systems need to be far more complex (both in terms of hardware and mathematical models) to operate properly. 

This section will talk about coherent receivers, first discussing the &quot;Simple Receiver&quot; case, and then going into theory about what the optimal case is. Once we know mathematically what an optimal receiver should be, we then discuss two actual implementations of the optimal receiver.

It should be noted that the remainder of this book will discuss optimal receivers. After all, why would a communication's engineer use anything that is less than the best?

== The Simple Receiver ==

A simple receiver is just that: simple. A general simple receiver will consist of a low-pass filter (to remove excess high-frequency noise), and then a sampler, that will select values at certain points in the wave, and interpolate those values to form a smooth output curve. In place of a sampler (for purely analog systems), a general envelope filter can also be used, especially in AM systems. In other systems, different tricks can be used to demodulate an input signal, and acquire the data. However simple receivers, while cheap, are not the best choice for a receiver. Occcasionally they are employed because of their price, but where performance is an issue, a better alternative receiver should be used.

== The Optimal Receiver ==

Mathematically, Engineers were able to predict the structure of the optimal receiver. Read that sentence again: Engineers are able to design, analyze, and build the best possible receiver, for any given signal. This is an important development for several reasons. First, it means that no more research should go into finding a better receiver. The best receiver has already been found, after all. Second, it means any communications system will not be hampered (much) by the receiver.

=== Derivation ===

here we will attempt to show how the coherent receiver is derived.

=== Matched Receiver ===

The matched receiver is the logical conclusion of the optimal receiver calculation. The matched receiver convolves the signal with itself, and then tests the output. Here is a diagram:

          
 s(t)-----&gt;(Convolve with r(t))-----&gt;

This looks simple enough, except that convolution modules are often expensive. An alternative to this approach is to use a correlation receiver.

=== Correlation Receiver ===

The correlation receiver is similar to the matched receiver, instead with a simple switch: The multiplication happens first, and the integration happens second.

Here is a general diagram:

            r(t)
             |
             v
 s(t) -----&gt;(X)-----&gt;(Integrator)---&gt;

In a digital system, the integrator would then be followed by a threshold detector, while in an analog receiver, it might be followed by another detector, like an envelope detector.

== Conclusion ==

To do the best job of receiving a signal, we need to know the form of the signal that we are sending. This should seem obvious, we can't design a receiver until after we've decided how the signal will be sent. This method poses some problems however, in that the receiver must be able to line up the received signal with the given reference signal to work the magic: If the received signal and the reference signal are out of sync with each other, either as a function of an error in phase or an error in frequency, then the optimal receiver will not work.

&lt;p&gt;For purposes of simplicity, we can define a &quot;verb&quot; as any word which indicates action in a sentence.  In French, verb forms are changed by a process known as conjugation to indicate relative time or condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All verbs have a tenseless (or timeless) base form called the &quot;infinitive&quot; that can be translated into English as &quot;to&quot; plus the verb.  In French, infinitives are easily recognized by their standardized infinitive endings of -er, -ir, or -re.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;parler:  to talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sortir:  to leave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perdre:  to lose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the examples listed above, the infinitives &lt;i&gt;to talk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;to leave&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;to lose&lt;/i&gt; are &quot;timeless&quot; in that they do not indicate when an action took place, if an action is presently taking place, or whether an action will take place.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to note that infinitives never need to agree in number (singular or plural) or gender (masculine or feminine) with any other part of the sentence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Advanced Maternal Age - Chorionic Villus Sampling'''

==Contracting==
*Introductions and small talk
*Confirm referring obstetrician
*Assess understanding for the referral
*Elicit concerns and questions
*As maternal age increases, we know that the risk for having a child born with a chromosome abnormality also increases.
*The reason that we like to see women who are 35 or older is because we can offer testing options
*I would like to start today by gathering some medical and family history information so that we can look for any other risk factors that we may need to talk about.
**We want to see if there is anything in your history that could pose a risk to this pregnancy

==Medical/Family History==
*LMP:_________
*EDC:_________
*Today's gestational age:_________
*How has this pregnancy been going?
*Any complications?
*Have you had an ultrasound?
**Date ________
**Findings:______________
*Anyone in the family have:
**Birth defects, SABs, SB, MR, LD, chronic illness, or early cancers?
*Tell them what I found; &quot;looks good, it sounds like the pregnancy is going well, I don't see anything that concerns me&quot;*
*Do you have any questions?

==Explanations of Genes and Chromosomes==
*All pregnancies are at a 3-5% risk of having a baby born with a birth defect.
*Women are born with all the eggs that we will ever have, unlike men who continuously make sperm from puberty throughout their lives.
*Eggs are stopped in a stage of division until one is ovulated each month.
*The older the egg, the more likely a division error might occur.
*General
*Karyotype
*Nondysjunction
*Brief natural history of chromosome abnormalities

==Age Related Risks==
*Patient's age at delivery: _______
*Risk for Down Syndrome: 1 in ________ ( %)
*Risk for any chrom. Abnormality: 1 in ________ ( %)

==Options==
*Level II Ultrasound:
**High resolution ultrasound
**Done at 20+ weeks by an experienced technician
***Better to see more of the developing organs
**U/S detection rate for DS is about 60% and for trisomy 18 ~90%
**Look for:
***Heart
***Brain
***Shape of the head
***Intestinal problems
***Kidneys
***U/S helps make us suspicious but doesn't give us a yes or no answer.

==CVS as an Option==
*Offered between 10-12 weeks
*Procedure used to obtain a sample of the placenta from the womb of an expectant mother.
*Genetic make-up of placental cells is essentially the same at the fetus since they both come from the same original cell created at conception
**When baby is created, the egg splits into two parts: a part that forms the baby and a part that forms the placenta
*Analysis can detect many genetic disorders/chromosome abnormalities with 98-99% accuracy
**Cannot detect about 90% of birth defects or the severity of a condition

==Explain Procedure==
*Transcervical CVS
**Only performed from 10-12 weeks
**Preferred method if the placenta is posterior and close to the cervix
**Sterile speculum is inserted and the vagina and cervix are cleaned with betadeine
**By U/S guidance, a thin catheter is guided into the placenta
**A syringe is attached and gentle suction is applied to aspirate the villi
**Large sample (whole villi) taken
**Catheter is removed
**NOT recommended for women with a retroverted uterus
*Transabdominal CVS
**Easiest to perform with anterior or fundal placenta
**Abdomen is cleaned with betadeine
**A local anesthetic is applied to the skin
**By U/S guidance, a needle is guided through the abdominal wall and uterine wall into the placenta (avoid the amniotic sac)
**A syringe is attached and gentle suction is applied by the syringe plunger
**The needle is moved back and forth with re-direction through the placenta
**Small sample (pieces of villi) taken
*Procedure takes roughly 5-7 min, after prep time
*The sample is examined under the microscope to confirm that fetal tissue has been obtained. (If maternal tissue is present- repeat test).
*Following the procedure, the baby's heartbeat will be monitored by U/S
*Sample is sent to the lab for results
*Direct vs. Culture results:
**Direct analysis: A preliminary answer
***Analysis of outer cells which are spontaneously dividing
***Increased rate of error
***Results in 1-2 days
***Few labs do this

==Culture analysis==
*Analysis of cells from mesenchymal core
*More accurate
*Results in 7-14 days
*Results differ in about 2% of cases
*Results will be reported by ????

==Risks of complications==
*Miscarriage: increased above the background by 1%
*Transverse limb reduction defects
**Results show that the risk for transverse defects after CVS is ~1 in 3000 (0.03%)
**Results show the greatest defects when CVS was performed prior to 10 weeks (limbs are formed at 10 weeks)
**How? Suspected that instrumentation interrupts the vascular supply
**VUMC has not had any CVS patients who had pregnancies born with limb reductions defects as a result of the procedure.

==Disadvantages==
*Risk of laboratory failure
*Maternal cell contamination
*Mosaicism
**Presence of two or more cell lines that differ with respect to their chromosomal constitution
**Although the placenta and fetus start out the same, once they diverge- there is a very small chance that the placental cells might have a change that is not changed in the fetal cells - confined placental mosaicism
*Insufficient sample obtained
*With any of these, follow up is required.
**Additional testing

==Amniocentesis==
*Also an option, performed from 15+ weeks
*Transabdominal removal of amniotic fluid
*~ same accuracy, but risks are 1 in 200 for complications.
*Tests for NTD's

==Follow-up==
*How do you feel about having a CVS? Would you like a few minutes to discuss the option with your partner?
*Re-iterate that most babies are born healthy
*Will want to do an u/s at about 18-20 weeks- anatomy is big enough to be easily visualized. (looking for structural anomalies)
*MSAFP blood test (to detect NTD's)
*Elicit final questions and concerns.

==General Information about Asthma and Allergy==
*Asthma is &quot;a disease characterized by an increased responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to various stimuli and manifested by a widespread narrowing of the airways. Hyperreactivity, the single most important component of the disease simply means that the airways of asthmatics will react to much smaller amounts of a number of stimuli to produce a certain increase in airways resistance…&quot;
*About 10% of children have asthma. This is usually as part of a syndrome of atopy, which can include the presence of allergy, asthma, seasonal rhinitis and eczema, and tends to occur in familial clusters.
*Symptoms of hay fever and asthma often occur together, but it is not unusual to have just one or the other
*Atopic dermatitis is more likely to be seen in patients with symptoms of hay fever and/or asthma.
*Asthma and other atopic disorders affect a large percentage of the population
*Atopic conditions are characterized by high immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses to common antigens (environmental allergens)
*The most common allergens, resulting in atopic asthma are: home dust saprophytes, pollens, feather, fungus shreds, animal fur, insect poison, animal sweat, food, drugs and other chemical substances.
*2001 study found house dust mites and cat produced allergens are the most frequent direct causes of acute airway constriction, occupational environment is responsible in 5 to 10% of cases, and other allergic reactions (such as hay fever) produced about 13%.
*Serum IgE levels and specific IgE antibody levels are used in determining allergic status because there is a significant positive correlation between allergic status and total serum IgE level.
*However there are individuals with high IgE levels who are not clinically allergic and have negative skin tests

==Genetics of Atopic Conditions==
*Many factors contribute to the phenotype of asthma and it is generally believed to be multifactorial, but there is a strong genetic predisposition and many scientists believe the genetic factors are more responsible than environmental factors
*However the genetic factors responsible may be different in different families (genetic heterogeneity)
*The relationship between genetic inheritance and asthma was shown to be quite strong in a study just published in 2001. Children are 3.2 times more likely to develop asthma than the general population if their mothers had asthma, 2.9 times more likely if their fathers had it, and 7 times more likely if both parents had it
*Twin studies indicate approximately a .6 heritability factor for both total serum IgE levels and bronchial hyperreactivity
*IL-4 is a central mediator of allergic inflammation. Along with IL-13, it is the major cytokine responsible for the induction of IgE synthesis.
*Many other genes have been implicated as playing a role in asthma, but it was too many to really research thoroughly on med-line although I started to and got a little carried away
*The press got hold of the announcement of a newly discovered asthma gene in Feb 2001, that was supposed to account for up to 40% of asthma cases. Many scientists were skeptical about this finding and I couldn't find an actual journal article to tell me anything substantial about it. (I would want to look into this further, but I already spent way too much time on this)
*In 1992 a gene for atopy was assigned to chromosome 11q by linkage to the marker D11S97. These findings show that transmission of atopy at the chromosome 11q locus is detectable only through the maternal line. The pattern of inheritance is consistent either with paternal genomic imprinting or with maternal modification of developing immune responses.
*There also seems to be data to suggest heritability of .47 for the release of mediators like histamine

==Genetic Counseling Risk Factors==
*The genetics of allergic disease is still not clear, the picture that is being built is very complex, and the actual risks are therefore somewhat uncertain and vary within the literature
*One quote for the empiric risk to a child if one parent was affected was as high as 60%, but a quote from a more current article was 20% for the average risk if one parent is affected
*Two major competing models seem to fit the data in different studies. These are probably highly simplified (see table)
**Recessive model in which &quot;high IgE allele is recessive&quot; and &quot;low IgE allele&quot; is dominant
**We can't rule this out from the pedigree. Using this model, risks can be as high as 50% if Mr. R is a carrier for &quot;high IgE allele&quot; (but remember that high IgE is not completely predictive of allergic diease)
*Multifactorial model
**Would be influenced by the number and disease status of other children they have. However, they don't have any yet
**Risks don't change as drastically with the birth of one affected child
***These risks were from a book published in 1992, but it still seems that this is the same debate as of 2000
*Data suggest that a single locus gene explains a portion of asthma that is related to the history of atopic diseases. In addition, a polygenic/multifactorial (genetic and environmental factors) influence with a recessive component inheritance may be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Am. J. Med. Genet. 93:373-380, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

==Other factors affecting atopic conditions==
*Age effects
**Children increasing likely to become allergic from age 2 - young adulthood
*Sex effects
**Boys more likely to be allergic as girls (twice as likely under age 10 to get atopic asthma)
**As adults more women develop allergies and rates are similar
*Racial differences
*Smoking
**May raise IgE levels slightly

==Ways to reduce risks to children==
*Several studies have shown that breast-fed babies are less likely to develop allergic disease later in life, but other studies have shown no differences in allergies or mean total serum IgE
*Dust control the home
*Avoid exposures to new allergens (proteins in the workplace and new pets)
*Pregnant and nursing women with high risks for allergies in their fetus should avoid certain foods such as milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts, and chocolate as well as reduce wheat, corn, soy, fish, and citrus products during last trimester
*These same foods should not be given to young infants

''Part of the [[Fortran]] WikiBook''

== Introduction ==

Fortran programs are made up of the main program and modules, each can contain [[../Fortran examples|subroutines and functions]].

Code that should be executed when the program is run should be placed in a '''PROGRAM''' block, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  PROGRAM name_of_program
     variable declarations
     program statements
  END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;
Indentation is not required, but is recommended. The name of the program must start with a letter, and can otherwise contain letters, numbers, and the _ ([[w:underscore|underscore]]) character.
Each statement terminates with the end of the line.

== Free Form and Fixed Form ==

The Fortran 77 syntax requires that you give 6 spaces before any commands. These 6 spaces originate from the punched card version of Fortran. After the first 6 spaces, you may place additional spaces for indentation if you wish.

However, there is a maximum total line width of 72 characters (including the first 6 spaces). If you require extra space you can put any character (except 0 with some compilers) in column 6; this is called a &quot;continuation character&quot;.  With punched cards, this meant that you could continue the line onto a second card.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 12345678...
       PRINT *,&quot;This is a really....
      *...long line.
&lt;/source&gt;

On some compilers you can '''turn off''' the 6 spaces rule, and turn off fixed length lines, by specifying &quot;free form&quot; and not &quot;fixed form&quot; mode. 
If you use the GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran), you can use the ''-ffree-form'' command line option when compiling for the same purpose.

== Spaces ==
: ''Consistently separating words by spaces became a general custom about the tenth century A. D., and lasted until about 1957, when FORTRAN abandoned the practice.'' —Sun FORTRAN Reference Manual

Spaces are ignored in FORTRAN.

== Commenting ==

Inclusion of an exclamation mark, '''!''', on a line makes the rest of the line a comment, like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 a = b ! this is a comment
 c = d ! this!! is also a comment
&lt;/source&gt;

In fixed-form mode, you can also mark a whole line as a comment by placing a '''*''' or a '''c''' in the first column.

== Variables ==

''See [[../Fortran variables|Variables]]''

There are many different types and options for variables, but for now we'll stick to the basics.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  REAL  A !decimal number.
  INTEGER  A !whole number.
  CHARACTER  A !single character (strings are coming up)
&lt;/source&gt;

It is recommended to use the '''IMPLICIT NONE''' statement before variable declarations to avoid typing errors by forcing the explicit declaration of every program variable.

== Mathematical operators == 

''See [[../Fortran Simple math|Mathematics]]''

* Add, subtract, multiply, divide
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  +
  -
  *
  /
&lt;/source&gt;

* Assignment
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  =
&lt;/source&gt;

* To the power of ( 2**4 is two to the fourth power = 16 )
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  **
&lt;/source&gt;

The mathematical operators have a certain precedence order:

'''**''' [exponentiation] always comes first, it is right to left associative.
i.e. 2**3**2 = 512, not 64

Next comes '''*''' [multiplication] and '''/''' [division], these are left to right associative,
i.e., 1.0/1.0/2.0*6.0 = ((1.0/1.0)/2.0)*6.0 = 3.0, not 12.0.

Next in order is '''+''' [addition] and '''-''' [subtraction], these are left to right associative as well, so x-y+z = (x-y)+z = x+(-y)+z.

Finally comes '''=''' [assignment].

== Comparative and Logical operators == 

In &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; statements, and in some other places, you can code relational operators =, &lt;, &gt;, ≤, ≥, and ≠, respectively as &lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GT.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.LE.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.GE.&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.NE.&lt;/code&gt;. Another way to write these operators would be: ==, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, and /=, respectively.

You can also use the logical operators &lt;code&gt;.AND.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.OR.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.NOT.&lt;code&gt;, as well as the logical constants &lt;code&gt;.TRUE.&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.FALSE.&lt;/code&gt;.  When combining these items, do not double up on the dots.  For instance, &lt;code&gt;a .AND. .NOT. b&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;a.AND.NOT.b&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;a.AND..NOT.b&lt;/code&gt;.

== WRITE statements ==

''See [[../Fortran simple input and output|Input and Output]]''

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  WRITE (*,*) &quot;Hello World&quot;, variablename, &quot;More text&quot;, anothervariable
&lt;/source&gt;

(*,*) means to use the default output with default options, usually print to screen.  Things inside quotes are printed as they look in the code, and the value of the variable is printed. Objects must be separated by commas, and the write statement automatically ends the line by default.

The full formal syntax is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   WRITE (UNIT=unit'record', FMT=format, ERR=statement) &quot;Hello World&quot;, variablename, &quot;More text&quot;, anothervariable
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that some versions of Fortran don't allow double-quotes, and require single-quotes.  An enclosed single-quote can be represented by doubling.  For instance, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'don''t'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

The first parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the unit number.  Unit numbers are associated with input or output streams in a way determined by the operating system.  In very old systems, the unit number is the device address.  In IBM JCL systems, the association between unit numbers and files are done with JCL &lt;code&gt;DD&lt;/code&gt; statements.  In other versions, there is some statement that associates files and units.  The &lt;code&gt;UNIT=&lt;/code&gt; tag may be omitted.  If an asterisk is used for the unit number, then the I/O involved is the standard input channel, or the standard output channel.

The second parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the record number.  Note that this argument, if present, is separated from the unit number by a single quote.  If present, this variable defines which record number is read from or written to.  For instance,
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   iRecordNumber = 5
   WRITE(2'iRecordNumber) x, y, z
&lt;/source&gt;
writes x, y, and z in packed machine-specific format into record number 5.  Note, of course, that this usage requires that your OS or Fortran compiler know what constitutes a record.  In byte-organized files, the above code would write x, y, and z starting at the file's byte #5.

The third parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the format number.  If this third argument is present as an asterisk, as above, then the formatting is the obvious default.  If you'd rather use a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement to format the input or output, then include the statement number for the &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement.  For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   WRITE(7,1) 'Hello, world!', i, 'More text', x
   1 FORMAT(A,I,A,F)
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that a &lt;code&gt;FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; statement is not executable as an in-line statement.  It is only used where referenced by &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;FMT=&lt;/code&gt; tag may be omitted.  The entire argument may be omitted, too.  However, if you omit the format argument, the I/O will be performed unformatted, using machine-specific, packed data.

The last parenthesized argument to &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; is the error handler line number.  For instance, if
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   WRITE(5,ERR=2) x, y, z
&lt;/source&gt;
is coded, this means that output is to be unformatted to unit 5.  If an error occurs, execution continues at statement 2 (the statement with a statement label of 2 in front of it).  If an error occurs, and there is no &lt;code&gt;ERR=&lt;/code&gt; argument, then the program abnormally terminates.  Thus, &lt;code&gt;ERR=&lt;/code&gt; is the closest equivalent of &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; in other languages.  Although this last argument may be omitted entirely, &lt;code&gt;ERR=&lt;/code&gt; can't be omitted from the argument once used.

== Example Code ==

''See [[../Fortran examples|More Examples in Fortran]]''

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  PROGRAM nearlyuseless
    IMPLICIT NONE
    REAL :: temperature
    INTEGER :: cows
    temperature = 98.6
    cows = 9
    WRITE (*,*) &quot;There are &quot;, cows, &quot; cows outside.&quot;
    WRITE (*,*) &quot;You are probably &quot;, temperature, &quot; right now&quot;
  END PROGRAM nearlyuseless
&lt;/source&gt;

Some versions of Fortran, or in some settings, use format characters.  When formatting characters are used, the first character of the line determines how the line is printed.  &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means new page.  &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means 2 line-feeds before the line (double-space).  &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; means 3 line-feeds before the line (triple-spacing).  &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; means no line-feeds before the line (overprinting).  And a space means a single line-feed before the line (normal printing).

Here's the same program in archaic form, with this forms-control character:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   temperature = 98.6
   iCows = 6
   WRITE(*,*) ' There are ', iCows, ' cows outside.'
   WRITE(*,*) ' You are probably ', temperature, ' right now.'
   END
&lt;/source&gt;

== Conclusion ==

So there you have it, some very simple Fortran knowledge.  Enjoy.

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior contact
*Assess concerns and questions they have
*Explain that their concerns will be addressed

==Elicit Family History and Pedigree==

==Elicit Medical History==
*Include information about environmental/occupational hazards and smoking

==What is Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AAT deficiency)?==
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes low levels of, or no alpha-1 antitrypsin in the blood.
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein that is made in the liver. The liver releases this protein into the bloodstream.
*The deficiency of this protein may predispose an individual to several illnesses
**The most common illness in adults with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is lung disease during the third and fourth decades of life (and beyond). This is (often) earlier than in those without the deficiency
***Most commonly it is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
***COPD is characterized by coughing, shortness of breath, sputum production, rapid breathing, wheezing, and weight loss due to the energy required for labored breathing.
***COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema
****chronic bronchitis - inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes
****emphysema - permanent destruction of the alveoli
***AAT Deficiency is the most common genetic cause of emphysema. It is also the most frequent cause of disability and early death among affected people.
***AAT deficiency may cause progressive liver damage (cirrhosis) or liver cancer, primarily in those that have a ZZ phenotype.
***40-60% of ZZ patients experience liver disease in their lifetime. In infants, it is one of the most common causes for neonatal cholestasis.  In a prospective study by Sveger et al in which 200,000 newborns were screened in the 1970's, 127 ZZ newborns were identified that are still followed today.  Their data showed that life-threatening liver disease (over all risk 5%) can occur in the first few months or years of life but that 80% of those individuals are healthy and free of chronic disease by 18 years.  
***Some patients with cirrhosis lead relatively normal lives for relatively long periods of time
***Some patients have serious liver damage that requires a liver transplant.
***Less than 3% may develop cancer of the liver.
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and is the most common genetic disease for which liver transplantation is undertaken in children.
**Some children show signs of liver failure at birth including jaundice, swelling of the abdomen, and poor feeding
**In some children, the signs of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency do not become apparent until early childhood or adolescence when they may develop hepatitis, enlarged spleen, ascites, pruritus and other signs of liver injury.
**Only 10-15% of children with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease. In some families one child may not show any signs of liver disease whereas a brother or sister may be seriously affected.
*There is currently no treatment for alpha-1 related liver disease.  
*It is possible to have AAT deficiency without having developed symptoms yet or that has been misdiagnosed.  It is possible to have the deficiency and never develop symptoms.  Those with environmental exposures (to lung and/or liver) are more likely to develop symptoms and there is a correlation between environmental exposures and other genetic factors with age of onset and severity.
*The reasons for the wide variability, from normal life span and normal activity through life, to severe liver or lung disease are largely unknown.  There are currently studies underway to understand this.  If you are interested in partcipating in research, I would encourage you to contact the alpha-1 research registry at 1-877-886-2383.

==Who is at risk?==
*An estimated 1 in 1500 to 1 in 7000 people has alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency world wide and it is found in nearly all populations.  In the US about 1 in 4455 has alpha-1(Stoller and Aboussouan, 2012.)
*It is very rare among people of Asian and African descent.
*It is most prevalent among people of Northern European (Scandinavian and British) and Iberian (Spanish and Portuguese) descent.
*70,000-100,000 people are estimated to be affected in the U.S., and a similar number in Europe are thought to be affected
*Of the estimated 100,000 in the U.S. less than 10% have been diagnosed
*It is thought that AAT deficiency is widely underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as asthma or cigarette smoking induced COPD.
*Estimated carrier frequencies in the above mentioned at risk populations have been quoted as high as 1:25
*Research suggests that some carriers may be at increased risk for lung disease at a later age of onset, particularly if they smoke.
*Other more current research suggests that being a carrier is not a very important determining factor compared to other risks such as smoking.

==How does a deficiency lead to lung disease?==
*Alpha-1 antitrypsin protects the lungs against another protein that can harm lung tissue. (It is called neutrophil elastase-- an enzyme released by white blood cells to help fight infections)
*When the lungs do not have enough alpha-1 antitrypsin, these proteins are free to destroy lung tissue.
*As a result, the lungs lose some of their ability to expand and contract (elasticity)
*This leads to difficulty breathing.
*Destruction of the alveoli can also occur and lead to emphysema
*The speed at which lung tissue is destroyed varies with each person.
*It is known that tobacco smoking worsens the lung damage.

==How does a deficiency lead to liver disease?==
*Individuals with ZZ type AAT deficiency often do not secrete AAT after it is made by the liver.
*Some of the AAT is broken down but the portion that is not accumulates in the liver cells.
*This accumulation is believed to cause damage the liver and lead to cirrhosis.

==How is it inherited?==
*Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic condition
*Explain genes and chromosomes
*Alpha 1 antitrypsin is encoded by a gene (''serpina1'') located on the distal long arm of chromosome 14.
*There are at least 120 different variations, or alleles, of the gene that make alpha 1 antitrypsin.
*We get one copy of this gene from each of our parents
*The M allele is the most common form (actually there are a group of M alleles along with other very rare normal variants)
*If a person inherits an M gene from both their parents they will have normal levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin (MM genotype)
*The Z allele contains a mutation. As a result there is not as much alpha 1 antitrypsin into the blood (~15% of normal amount).
*The protein formed from the Z allele has a glu changed to a lys
*This causes misfolding of the polypeptide and polymerization of alpha-1 antitrypsin Z molecules
*Polymerization of the Z alpha-1 antitrypsin molecules leads to accumulation of abnormal protein in hepatocytes, some of which is subsequently degraded.  How and how much gets degraded are laregely controlled by epigenetic mechanisms not yet identified but currently being researched
*When a person inherits the Z gene from both parents they will have very low alpha-1 antitrypsin levels that can lead to tissue damage of the lungs and/or liver disease (ZZ genotype)
*If a person inherits one M gene and one Z gene they are called a carrier. Although they usually have less alpha 1 antitrypsin in their blood then those with two M genes, they do not usually develop any symptoms because they still have sufficient amounts to protect their lungs.  However, it has been shown that smokers that are carriers are at a higher risk for lung disease than the general population, it is therefore recommended that MZ's avoid smoking and working environments that constantly expose the lungs to dust or chemicals.  
*MZ phenotype was associated with an increased prevalence of byssinosis compared with the MM phenotype: 3/8 (38%) and 25/187 (13%). An association between the MZ phenotype and familial allergy was also found, although the association was somewhat weaker.
*5% of Scandinavians, 4% of Britons, 1 to 2% of southern Europeans, and 2-3% of the heterogeneous white population in the United States are MZ (carrier) heterozygotes.
*If both parents are carriers for the Z allele then each pregnancy results in a 25% chance of having a child that will be ZZ and therfore at risk for lung and liver disease
*The S variant of this gene makes functional alpha 1 antitrypsin, but it is recycled faster and results in about 60% normal amounts secreted into the blood stream.
*If a person inherits two copies of the S variant then their alpha 1 antitrypsin levels are reduced (slightly higher than the MZ carrier) and they typically don't show any symptoms
*If a person inherits one S and one Z variant they have a mildly increased risk for lung disease.
*There is a relatively high frequency of the S allele (0.04-0.08 in U.S. Caucasians). Therefore MS heterozygotes are relatively frequent.
*1 in 10 persons of European origin will be heterozygous for either the S or Z variant (MZ or MS genotype)
*About 5 % of people with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency will have other rare allele variants (ex)F, Mmalton, Mheerlen(null), I).
*In some rare cases, a person's body may not produce any alpha-1 antitrypsin. This condition results from inheriting two genes that produce any functional protein . It is called &quot;null-null type.&quot;
*The null-null phenotype is accompanied by emphysema as are the ZZ and SZ phenotypes but an important difference is that cirrhosis and liver cancer do not occur with the null-null phenotype because there is no abnormal antitrypsin product accumulation.

==Who should be tested?==
*The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all individuals with COPD as well as adults and adolescents with asthma be tested.
*Clinical features that suggest the possibility of AAT deficiency and the need for serum testing include emphysema at an early age, emphysema in a nonsmoker (or light smoker), a family history of emphysema, emphysema of the lower lungs (as determined by chest radiograph), adult-onset asthma, and recurrent bronchitis.
*It is also suggested that testing be done on most patients with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, wheezing) at least once.
*It has been suggested that carrier screening should be performed on people in high- risk populations.

==What is the test?==
*It is a simple blood test that can be done on a finger stick or venous blood sample
*It will determine the amount of AAT in your blood (blood enzyme levels)
**Serum testing is a screening procedure. Most hospital laboratories report serum AAT levels in mg/dl or g/L, with a normal range from approximately 100-300 mg/dl. Levels less than 58 mg/dL or 11μM suggest severe deficiency.  Those that are slightly below normal suggest carrier status, however, often a carrier can have a normal level, so it is important to order a phenotype and/or genotype test in addition to the serum level.
**Reference laboratories usually report the serum levels in micromolar concentration, with a normal range of 20-60 μM and a threshold level for emphysema at 11 micromol/L.
*The same blood sample can also be used to determine which type of protein or Pi type (the phenotype) you have by separating the alpha-1 antitrypsin proteins on a gel
**Therefore the phenotype test can tell you if you are a carrier for one of the genes that causes alpha 1 deficiency
**The phenotype is usually determined if alpha 1 antitrypsin levels are below 30 micromoles/ liter or if there is a known family history
**Therefore, to detect all heterozygous carriers it is important to make sure the lab performs phenotype testing.
**Phenotyping is required to confirm the presence of AAT deficiency. A phenotype should be confirmed with genotype.
**The phenotype, PiZZ, is responsible for nearly all cases of AAT emphysema and liver disease. PiZZ phenotype serum levels range from 3.4-7 micromol/L, about 10-20% of the normal levels.
Lastly, a genotype test typically screens for the S and Z allele (more depending on the lab).  
Ideally, to have the most accurate diagnosis, the Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Profile will do all 3 (level, phenotype and genotype)

==Where is testing available?==
*Free (confidential) test kits are available through the Alpha-1 Foundation's Alpha-1 Coded Testing Trial conducted through the Medical University of South Carolina and they take 2-4 weeks for the order to be processed. They test for both levels of protein and genotype.  To participate visit their site at www.alphaoneregistry.org or call their Genetic Counselor at 1-877-785-3177 to discuss testing and any questions that you may have.   
*Free genetic screening kits are also available through the drug companies that produce the only treatment specific to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.  They are Grifols, CSL Behring and Baxter.  Information may be found online.  Each test is a little different and must be taken to a doctor's office to be completed.
*Many commercial companies such as LabCorp and Mayo Medical Laboratories also offer alpha-1 testing.  I recommend at least a level + genotype or phenotype.  Ideally, the Alpha-1 antitrypsin profile will do the level + phenotype and reflex to a genotype.

==Reasons for being tested==
*There are ways to help prevent further tissue damage in the lung such as:
**receive immunizations for flu and pneumonia
**receive early treatment for lung infections by seeing your doctor at the first sign of a cold or other lung problem
**avoid tobacco smoke, noxious fumes, dust, and pollution
**stay fit by doing regular exercise
**increase your alpha-1 antitrypsin by protein replacement therapy: intravenous infusion of the purified human alpha-1 antitrypsin protein (augmentation therapy) used to treat patients that are severely deficient.  
*You can also reduce symptoms of shortness of breath by doing the following:
**using medications (for example, bronchodilators, or inhaled steroids) prescribed by your doctor to help open your airways
**using oxygen if your doctor prescribes it
**doing pulmonary rehabilitation (including breathing techniques)

==Family planning (knowing risks to future children)==
*As of 1987 prenatal testing is available for fetuses known to be at risk
*Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis with IVF is available
*Gene therapy in the future? Research has been done in mice using gene therapy for AAT deficiency

==Possible reasons for not being tested==
*1)Genetic discrimination- fear of being fired or losing insurance benefits due to a positive genetic test.
*GINA (genetic information non-discrimination act) went into law in 2008 and protects ''asymptomatic'' individuals from discrimination by health insurers and employers.  Health insurance is further protected by ACA (Affordable Care Act, 2011).  This does not protect against discrimination for life, long-term care or disability insurance.  I recommend that healthy, asymptomatic individuals consider purchasing before pursuing genetic testing.  For symptomatic individuals it is some what of a moot point as insurance carriers will likely use health information to deny/raise premiums.  Additionally, it does not protect those in the military or work for federal government, althought the law is largely observed to this point.  
*There is a reported case where a person lost their job after receiving a bill for treatment procedures in a woman with a positive test for alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
*She was supported by the AlphaNet, the Alpha 1 Association, the Genetic Alliance, the National Partnership for Women and Families and the Coalition for Genetic Fairness
*She won the right in Nov 2000 to pursue a wrongful discharge law suit.
*Concerns about this may be avoided by confidential testing
*2)Fear of knowing health risks

==Other psychosocial issues to consider==
*Anxiety associated with waiting for test results
*Anxiety and difficult decisions associated with knowing you and/or your partner are carriers and may pass alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency on to offspring
*Anxiety that may come if testing positive for AAT deficiency in the absence of present symptoms due to the uncertainty about if, when and how severely one might be affected.
*May encourage individuals to make healthier life choices

== What is Envelope ==
Envelope is a new visual tool to help you rig your characters faster and easier. It can often save you a lot of time.
Each bone has a special area around it, allowing you to tell Blender what part of the geometry will follow each bone. This zone is customizable so you can move, scale and blend them together.

[[Image:Ie_envelope.jpg]]

== Edit Envelope ==
You can edit this white zone in Editmode or posemode by going in Envelope display mode (Buttons Window  &amp;rarr; Armature  &amp;rarr; Display Options  &amp;rarr; Envelope), selecting bones and using SKEY or CTRL-ALT-SKEY.

''In Editmode:'' you can select the Tip, the Body or the Root and scale using SKEY. This area in the middle will assign a weight of 1 to all vertices contained in here. All vertices with a weight of 1 will completely follow this bone. The white transparent area around the center is a zone of influence which loses power as you go away from the center.  This area is scaled when selecting the body of a bone and doing CTRL-ALT-SKEY.
''In Posemode:'' You can only scale the zone of influence with ALT-SKEY when in Envelope display mode. It's real time, and lets you tweak the influence while you animate. So if you notice there is a vertex not following in the new pose you just did: Just select the bone it should follow, and scale the zone a bit until the vertex goes back with his friends. Example:

[[Image:Ie_little_zone.jpg]][[Image:Ie_ok_zone.jpg]]

== Envelope Options ==
It's possible to enable/disable the use of Envelope in the Modifier stack using the &quot;Envelope&quot; toggle.

[[Image:ie_Arm_parent.jpg]]

There are also two important buttons in the Armature Bones panel: Deform and Mult.

[[Image:edit_panel_bones.jpg]]

Enabling the Deform button will tell Blender to deform geometry with this bone. It's useful because in a more complex rig not all the bones are there to deform, some bones are just there to move other bones.

The Mult option will tell Blender to multiply the weight it gets from envelope (let's say 0.7) with the weight you painted in weight paint (let's say 0.5). The result will be 0.5*0.7=0.35 so in fact you just tweaked the envelope influence to 0.3 when it was at 0.7. If you don't want vertices to be part of the zone, you can always paint it with 0, as 0*(something) will always give 0. This way you can give custom shape to your envelope. More on weight paint on next page.

[[Image:Ie_Mult.jpg]]

In this example of a formerly flat surface you can see that all the selected vertices are not following the bone when it is moved upwards. This is because I painted a weight of 0 on them. In weight paint you'll see nothing. But just the fact that they are part of the group with a weight of 0 will make that possible. If Mult is off and you have both a vertex group and envelope, Blender will add value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alpha Thalassemia'''

*Hemoglobin is the protein in blood that carries oxygen and gives blood its red color
*A hemoglobin molecule contains four globin chains
*There are different types of globin chains
*One of the chains is designated alpha and the others can be grouped together and called non-alpha
*The combination of two alpha chains and two non-alpha chains produces a complete hemoglobin molecule
*The combination of two alpha chains and two gamma chains form &quot;fetal&quot; hemoglobin, termed &quot;hemoglobin F&quot;
*Fetal hemoglobin is the primary hemoglobin in the developing fetus (With the exception of the first 10 to 12 weeks after conception.
*The combination of two alpha chains and two beta chains form &quot;adult&quot; hemoglobin, also called &quot;hemoglobin A&quot;. Although hemoglobin A is called &quot;adult&quot;, it becomes the predominate hemoglobin within about 18 to 24 weeks of birth.
*Must have the right amount of each type of globin being made if there is an imbalance this will result in thalassemia
*There are different types of thalassemia
*The severity and type of thalassemia depends on which genes are affected

==Alpha Globin==
*The genes that tell the cell how to make alpha globin are found on chromosome 16
*Each chromosome 16 has two alpha globin genes that are next to each other on the chromosome
*Since each cell has two copies of chromosomes 16, a total of four alpha globin genes are usually present in each cell
*There are several different possible outcomes depending on how many of these copies are not functioning (usually due to being deleted)

==Silent Carrier==
*If one of the four copies of the alpha globin gene is not present in an individual they will not have any symptoms because they still make enough alpha globin.
*This individual is often referred to as a silent carrier

==Alpha Thalassemia Trait==
*If two of the genes are not present than the person is said to have the alpha thalassemia trait.
*Does not cause health problems or symptoms
*The red blood cells are often small and this is referred to as microcytosis
*2 ways of having alpha thalassemia trait which can become important when you want to determine risks to potential children
*2 genes on same chromosome not functioning (cis) figure 3
*1 gene on each chromosome (trans) figure 4

*When there are three missing copies of the gene then there is even less alpha globin
*This causes more serious anemia which often requires transfusions
*Other symptoms include: jaundice, enlarged spleen, and increased risk of infection
*Called hemoglobin H disease because of an abnormal hemoglobin that forms from excess beta globin(excess beta globin is present and 4 of these come together instead of having 2 alpha globin chains)
*Hemoglobin H does not carry oxygen and damages the membrane that surrounds the red cell, accelerating cell destruction.
*The combination of the very low production of alpha chains and destruction of red cells in hemoglobin H disease produces a severe, life-threatening anemia

==HB Bart's Hydrops Fetalis==
*If there are no genes present than the effects are even more serious
*Often the fetus is stillborn or dies shortly after birth
*Rarely, problem is detected in utero, if the disorder occurred in an earlier child. In utero blood transfusions have saved some of these children. These patients require life-long transfusions and other medical support.

==How does the screening test determine which category a baby fits?==
*Newborn screening test preformed in every US state measures the percentage of different types of hemoglobins. However, not every state newborn screening program tests and reports for alpha thalassemia.
*Barts hemoglobin consists of 4 gamma globin chains (results from not enough alpha globin to pair up with to form the fetal hemoglobin consisting of 2 alpha and 2 gamma) (gamma globin is no longer made about 18-24 weeks after birth)
*Depending on how much Barts hemoglobin an infant has will help categorize them
*Less than 5% -- most likely missing one gene and may be silent carrier
*5-10% usually indicates loss of 2 genes and may have alpha thalassemia trait
*&gt;10% (usually 15-20%) may have Hemoglobin H disease

==Testing==
*Testing can be performed to determine the parents' risks for future pregnancies. A primary care physician can order the following blood tests.
**complete blood count (CBC) - a measurement of size, number, and maturity of different blood cells in a specific volume of blood.
**hemoglobin electrophoresis with A2 and F quantitation - differentiation of the types of hemoglobin present
**FEP (free-erythrocyte protoporphyrin) and ferritin - to exclude iron deficiency anemia.
*The above testing is fairly inexpensive and covered by most types of insurance
*Gene testing also available, but more expensive and usually not needed. Testing of the alpha globin genes is the only way to determine silent alpha thalassemia trait.
*FISH can be performed to determine if there is a large deletion on chromosome 16 in the presence of severe developmental delay

==Types of mutations==
*Most are deletions of the gene(s)
*About 5% of alpha thalassemia is due to point mutations
*Often cause more severe thalassemia than single gene deletions
*Hemoglobin Constant Spring -- most common point mutation
*Stop codon mutated results in large alpha globin protein (RNA unstable and little protein is made)
*Mutations have also been found in regions of DNA that regulate expression of alpha globin gene

==Hydrops Fetalis==
*Can be due to a number of different reasons (immune response to blood that is incompatible such as Rh incompatibility or nonimmune hydrops)
*Nonimmune hydrops includes a number of explanations like cardiovascular, chromosome abnormality, pulmonary infection and homozygous alpha thalassemia (4 copies of alpha globin gene missing has even been seen in some with 3 missing copies)
*Sometimes the reason can not be determined
*Treatment for hydrops caused by some is starting to become available
*Prognosis still is poor

==How common is Alpha thalassemia==
*Occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds
*More common in Mediterranean, African, and South-east Asian populations
*Individuals of African descent are more likely to be silent carriers or have alpha thalassemia trait
*Individuals in Southeast Asia are more likely to have all four possibilities (estimates of carrier frequency are 1/30)
*Carrier frequency in other populations is not certain

Rare cases of learning difficulties have been associated with alpha thalassemia.

*Some due to large deletions of chromosome 16 (other genes presumably deleted too that cause learning difficulties)
*Can also be due to mutation of the ATRX gene(DNA helicase/repair enzyme). This gene is found on chromosome X and is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion. Individuals with a mutation in ATRX have a condition called Alpha-Thalassemia X-linked Intellectual Disability Syndrome. Symptoms can include: Developmental delay, distinctive facial features, genital anomalies, and anemia secondary to Hemoglobin H disease.

==Types of mutations==
*Most are deletions
*About 5% of alpha thalassemia is due to point mutations
*Often cause more severe thalassemia than single gene deletions
*Hemoglobin Constant Spring -- most common point mutation
*Stop codon mutated results in large alpha globin protein (RNA unstable and little protein is made)
*Mutations have also been found in regions of DNA that regulate expression of alpha globin gene

==Are you planning more children?==
*May want to consider testing for you and husband in the future so that it can be determined if there are risks for future pregnancies
A simple blood test can be performed that will detect most types of thalassemia trait
*We will have this information in letter so when and if you want to have the testing your physician can order it
*May be potential risks to _____ offspring
*Keep this in mind because she may decide with her partner to have him tested

==Psychosocial concerns==
*may be nervous and think there is something serious
*may be a lot of information to understand at once so talk about letter
*guilt about passing on something
*concern that other pregnancy with hydrops is related to this
*help understand that other reasons for hydrops are more likely due to their ethnic background

== Contents of the page ==

This page seems unclear to me. I don't know where this classification comes from and I don't understand how '''Graphical Method''' can be classified as a method for data collection. It is a way of displaying data but not collect them. [[User:PAC2|PAC2]] ([[User talk:PAC2|talk]])

== sections ==

This chapters has three sections : &quot;Experiments&quot;, &quot;Sample Surveys&quot; and &quot;observational studies&quot;. In my opinion, there is no opposition between those three items. A researcher can design an experiment and collect the information using a sample survey. I think there is an opposition between &quot;experiments&quot; and &quot;observational studies&quot; and another opposition between &quot;sample surveys&quot; and administrative datasets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alport Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Three genes have been associated with Alport syndrome:
*COL4A3
*COL4A4
*COL4A5
*About 80% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A5 and is X-linked inheritance
*About 15% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 is autosomal recessive inheritance
*About 5% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

==Incidence and carrier frequency==
*Approximately 1 in 50,000 Americans carry the Alport syndrome gene, not all of them get Alport syndrome
*Twice as many females carry the gene, but a higher percentage of males with the gene have symptoms of the syndrome.
*There are no racial or geographic concentrations of Alport syndrome
*Health issues for carriers:
*About 50% of carriers will have persistent or intermittent microhematuria (small amount of blood in the urine

==Risk to various family members==
*Parents of a male proband:
*The father will not have the disease or be a carrier
*In a family with more than one affected male, the mother is an obligate carrier
*In a family with one affected male, the probability the mother is a carrier is 85-90%, chance for a de novo mutation is 10-15%
*The mother of a male with X-linked Alport syndrome should have a urinanalysis. The presence of microhematuria (blood in the urine too small to be seen by the naked eye) means she is likely a carrier.
*Siblings of a proband: at conception:
*If mother is affected:
**50% risk of inheriting the mutation
**males will be affected if they inherit the mutations
**females will be carriers, may or may not be affected
*Offspring of a male proband:
**Will transmit the mutation to all of their daughters and none of their sons

==Clinical features==
The 3 main findings are renal, cochlear, and ocular involvement.
*Renal involvement:
**There is progressive deterioration of the glomerular basement membranes (GBMs), which are microscopic parts of the kidney. This deterioration may lead to chronic renal failure causing excess waste products in the blood (uremia).
**This kidney malfunction causes the loss of red blood cells and blood plasma proteins in the urine (hematuria, proteinuria).
**Bleeding into the glomerulus, a bunch of capillaries in the kidney, causes material (including various elements of the blood) to be excreted into the urine.
**Renal bone disease may occur as a result of renal failure. This can cause:
*abnormalities of bone
*abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolism
*abnormalities of parathyroid hormone secretion which regulates calcium and phosphate levels in the blood.
*Uremia (the presence of urea in the blood) can happen when the kidneys fail to remove waste products from the blood. Symptoms include:
*upset stomach, which may vary from loss of appetite to severe pain
*nausea
*vomiting of food and blood
*weakness
*fatigue
*excessive need for sleep
*dry often itchy skin
*peculiar-smelling breath similar to urine
*pale skin
*shortness of breath
*hypertension
*fluid retention
*swelling (edema)
*End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the final stage in chronic renal failure when there is virtually no more functioning nephrons present. Patients with ESRD must depend upon hemodialysis machines to cleanse their blood of waste products.
*All males with X-linked Alport syndrome develop proteinuria and eventually progressive renal insufficiency, which leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
*About 60% reach ESRD by age 30 years
*90% by age 40 years

==Cochlear involvement==
*Diminished hearing is usually detectable by late childhood or early adolescence in boys with XLAS.
*The hearing loss is progressive and about 80-90% of males with X-linked Alport syndrome have sensorineural deafness by age 40 years

==Ocular involvement==
*Abnormalities of the eye may include:
*The surface of the eye's lens may be cone-shaped (lenticonus) or spherical (spherophakia)
*The lens of the eye may be opaque or cloudy (cataracts).
*White dots may appear on the retina (retinal macular flecks or fundus albipunctatis).
*Children with Alport syndrome may be nearsighted (myopic)

==Testing==
*The diagnosis of Alport syndrome is made with the following criteria:
**history and physical examination, which may include audiologic and ophthalmic evaluation
**detailed family history and possibly urinalyses on first- and second-degree relatives
**immunohistochemical analysis of basement membrane type IV collagen expression, using skin and/or renal biopsy specimens
**examination of renal biopsy specimens by electron microscopy.
*With these guidelines a suspected diagnosis of Alport syndrome can be confirmed in the great majority of cases, and in most cases the genetic type of Alport syndrome can also be determined.
*Molecular genetic testing of the type IV collagen gene (COL4A5) implicated in X-linked Alport syndrome and the type IV collagen gene (COL4A3 and COL4A4) implicated in autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is available on a clinical basis
*detection of mutation &gt;60%
*Prenatal testing is available for X-linked Alport syndrome

==Surveillance, management, and treatment options==
*Chronic renal failure is aggressively treated:
*Renal function and certain components in the blood are regularly monitored.
*Fluid intake and diet, particularly salt and protein, may be restricted and regular medications prescribed.
*Control of blood pressure, prompt and aggressive treatment of urinary tract and ear infections is important.
*Hemodialysis may be used to treat chronic renal failure and ESRD.
*Dialysis involves removing blood from the patient's artery, cleansing it of unwanted substances that would normally be excreted in the urine, and returning the cleansed blood to a vein.
*Kidney transplantation is an alternative treatment. Because of the slight or inapparent disease in some female family members, great care must be taken in selecting living related kidney donors.
*Hearing loss may stabilize after successful kidney transplantation.
*Transplantation of the eye's cornea or removal of the eye's lens may be helpful in patients with visual problems.

==Differential diagnoses==
*Benign familial hematuria/thin basement membrane disease
*Fechtner/Epstein syndrome

==Psychosocial issues==
*For child: feelings of &quot;being different&quot;
*Concern and worry over the medical problems and frequent doctor visits
*Financial considerations, what will treatment cost?
*Who is their support network?
*Effects on relationships (parent/child)
*Concern about telling other family members
*Future reproductive decisions
*Possible disruption of marital relationships or family dynamics

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)'''

==What is ALS?==
*a degenerative disease of the nervous system, affecting the brain cells (motor neurons) that carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles
*results in muscular weakness and the progressive wasting of muscles that have lost their nerve supply
*the most common form of motor neuron disease
*patients have difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing
*death usually follows within 3 to 5 years
*onset commonly occurs between the ages of 35 and 65
*slightly more common in men than in women
*5-10% of ALS cases are familial
*The gene is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait and is located on the long arm of chromosome 21
*90% of ALS cases are sporadic, with no obvious genetic cause
*manifests differently amongst patients, likely due to environmental agents interacting with genetic susceptibility
*ALS strikes 2 to 7 out of every 100,000 people in the USA
*no specific treatment yet exists, and patients can be aided only by supportive therapy
*ALS is also called Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball star who died of it

==Symptoms==
*early symptoms include slight muscle weakness, clumsy hand movements, and/or difficulty performing tasks that require delicate movements of the fingers and/or hands
*muscular weakness in the legs may cause tripping and falling
*difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
*speech may be slowed
*progressive weakness of the lips and impairment and/or loss of function of the tongue, mouth, and/or voice box (bulbar symptoms)
*leg cramps may occur during the night, most frequently in the calf and/or thigh muscles
*uncontrolled twitching of muscles (fasciculations)
*exaggerated deep muscle reflexes.
*severe weight loss occurs in approximately 5% of cases
*increased risk for respiratory failure and abnormally low levels of oxygen in the blood
*increased risk for acute inflammation of the lungs, caused by the inhalation of food or stomach contents (aspiration pneumonia).
*an overall decrease in the ability to move may also result in inadequate nutrition

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anencephaly'''

==Introduction==
*Introduce myself
*Ask how she is, what she knows, what questions she has. Ask if there is anyone she wants to be with her as she hears information about the baby.

==Contracting==
*Go over a few of the things we talked about on the phone: pregnancy and family history
*Talk about what the ultrasound findings mean
*Talk about the amniocentesis
*Talk about other options
*Along the way, I want to make sure we answer all the questions you may have.

==Review of Family/pregnancy history==

==Basic info. on Anencephaly==
*write it down
*Introduce it through the words of the doctor: absence of the cranial vault.
*Definition: without brain. There's been a problem in the development of the brain structures. There is an absence of the bones that form the cranial vault (the part that covers our brain)and in the formation of the actual parts of the brain themselves. So what you feel when you put your hand on top of your head is not there. The skin is not there nor is the bony part. Only exposed brain or nothing at all.
*Incidence: gets lumped in with the Neural tube defects: spina bifida too = 1/1000
*Recurrence risks: for having another child once a sibling has it = 2.2% (Hall and Solehdin 1998). Most people quote a 3-5% risk.
*Females are affected 4 times more often than males
*Related abnormalities associated with anencephaly (PROBABLY NOT USED IN COUNSELING UNLESS THE FINDINGS ARE MADE) - just mention the starred ones.
**broad nose
**folded ears
**short neck
**large thymus
**small adrenal glands
**often polyhydramnios
**lungs are hypoplastic *
**can have Cleft lip and palate
**cyclopia
**syndactyly
**absent radius and thumbs
**clubfoot
**imperforate anus
**hernia
**renal and cardiac anomalies*

==Etiology of Anencephaly==
*During the 3rd week after conception the neural folds start to form into what is going to become the spinal cord and the brain. It starts in a central area and then follows particular steps until the entire length of the cord is closed by the 4th week. (the is the 1st and 2nd week after your last menstrual period.) Once it is closed, the brain starts to form all of its distinct parts.
*Anencephaly is the result of the failure of the anterior neuropore (upper area of the first portion of the spinal column) to close properly. Failure to close = degeneration of the already forming forebrain.

==Causes of Anencephaly==
*Multifactorial - 70-80% (combination of genetic factors and the environment) WE DON'T REALLY KNOW exact causes.
*Single gene changes ex = Meckle Gruber syndrome (will have additional ultrasound anomalies)
*Chromosomal changes = ex. Trisomy 18, 5p+, ring 13, Trisomy 20p - detectable by amniocentesis
*Teratogens
**hyperthermia
**insulin dependant diabetes
**seizure disorder medications = Tegretol, valproic Acid (usually associated with SB)
**Exposures to lead
**Lack of folic acid

==Diagnosis==
*High AFP from triple screen leads to an ultrasound
*Ultrasound finding is typically the absence of the cranial vault can be done early in 2nd trimester. (&gt;99%) You can still see an outline of the brain but by 17 weeks, it has deteriorated because of exposure to amniotic fluid.
*You can see it as early as 11 weeks. the brain has a weird outline, abnormally shaped.
*Amniocentesis with AchE if desired. (&gt;99%)

==Prognosis==
*Very very poor!!!
*Most babies die in utero through miscarriages or make it to term but are still births (50%)
*If survival outside the womb, live for a very short time, a few days.

==Options==
*Termination by D&amp;E (Dilatation and Evacuation)
**Can be done up to 24 weeks legally. (Up to 21 weeks here at Univ.)
**Cost - in hospital = $2500, clinic = less money
**Have to give pamphlet - WARN HER IF THIS IS SOMETHING SHE WANTS. Remind her that these are pictures of a healthy baby, not what her baby looks like.
**First step is going in and talking to the doctor
**Next step is getting lamineria (seaweed dried that will dialate the cervix) = cramping
**Go Home
**Come back into office get general anesthesia
**Take out lamenaria
**Use tubes to finish dialating
**Suction out amniotic fluid
**Use forceps to cut umbilical cord
**Pull out fetal parts
**Scrape out remainder.
**Benefits: quick!! Takes only 30sec-5min., outpatient basis, no impact on future fertility.
**Disadvantages: can't hold or see baby as a baby, no autopsy possible
**Complications possible: death, hemorrhage, tear in uterus, infection leading to septic shock
**Ideas: get ultrasound pictures, name baby, keep a journal, write a letter to the baby, make a memorial/service to the baby
*Termination by induction
**Between 13-24th week
**First meet with doctor and see book
**Lamaria will be placed, go home
**Enter hospital and start IV
**Given prostaglandin either suppositories every 3-4 hours, injection into amniotic fluid, or intramuscularly to start uterine contractions. (causes flu like symptoms)
**Takes 10-20 hours or up to 72 (you are going into labor)
**You are on the floor with other families delivering healthy babies (nurses attitudes may be different.)
**You have to deliver placenta right after = may need curettage suction. = you may not get to hold the baby right away.
**Benefits: you get to see and hold your baby in one piece.
**Disadvantages: not easy to get done, takes a long time, baby may be alive when you deliver it.
**Ideas: pictures, baptism, autopsy, footprints, memorial service, other family members can see the baby.
**Resource: Hand out: We've Been There, Support for Prenatal decision
*Things to consider after termination
**Breast milk may come = wear a tight bra and apply cold compresses.
**Bleeding for 1-2 weeks after delivery and mild cramping. You should rest for a week.
**A Time to Decide, A Time to Heal - for parents making difficult decisions about babies they love by Molly Minnick, Kathleen Delp, Mary Ciotti
*Maintain pregnancy
**Keep a watch on pregnancy...polyhydramnios may be present
**Prepare for intermittent periods of stable cardiorespiratory function. (a lot of up and down)
**Prepare family members
**Contact Starshine Hospice?
**Contact Fernside for son?
**Prepare funeral arrangements (in hospital/out of hospital)
**Good resource is: 1-888-206-7526 - Anencephaly support group
**Good resource: Your baby has a problem by Janet Ulm and Vickie Hannig

==Etiology==
[[Image:Ube3a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Genetic map of 15q11-q13 region]]]]
*Neurobehavioural disorder caused by deficient expression or function of E6AP ubiquitin protein ligase 3A ('''UBE3A''' gene product)
*Due to loss of '''maternal''' imprinting in 15q11-q13 region (AS/PWS region) by one of several mechanisms (patients are divided into classes I-V based on these mechanisms):
**I. Interstitial deletion of the region on copy of chromosome 15 inherited maternally (~4 Mb) (65-75%)
**II. Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) - father contributes both copies (3-7%)
**III. Imprinting defects (2-6%)
**IV. Mutation in the UBE3A gene (5-11%)
**V. Unknown mechanisms (11-20%)
*Patients with deletions usually more severely affected
*Affects 1 in 12,000 - 40,000 in population
*The sister syndrome, known as [[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Prader-Willi Syndrome-2|Prader-Willi syndrome]], is caused by the loss of the '''paternally'''-imprinted copy of the same region. The symptoms are quite different.
* There are recent data showing that artificial reproductive technology (mainly intraspermal sperm injection) interferes with establishment of imprint and presispose to imprinting disorders (e.g.: AS/PWS, [[Handbook of Genetic Counseling/Beckwith-Wiedemann_Syndrome | Beckwith-Wiedemanm syndrome(BWS)]])

==Clinical features==
*Key findings (~100%)
**Severe developmental delay by 6-12 months without loss of skills
**Speech impairment (no or minimal use of words)
**Movement or balance disorder (gait ataxia, tremulous movement of limbs, hypermotoric behaviour)
**Happy demeanor (&quot;''happy puppet''&quot;), excitability + hand flapping + inappropriate laughter, short attention span
*Common findings (80%)
**Delayed or disproportionately slow growth in head circumference
**Seizures (usually before age 3)
**Abnormal EEG (large amplitude slow spike and triphasic waves)
*Associated findings (20-80%)
**Flat back of head
**Strabismus
**Hypopigmentation of skin and eyes
**Tongue thrusting, sucking/swallowing disorders, excessive chewing and mouthing behaviors
**Feeding problems during infancy
**Wide mouth, wide-spaced teeth, prominent mandible (prognathia)
**Hyperactive tendon reflexes
**Sleep disorders
**Uplifted flexed arms while walking
**Increased sensitivity to heat
**Sleep disturbance
**Fascination with water



==Diagnostic testing==
*DNA methylation analysis 
**Most sensitive test (identifies 80% of cases)
**Detects deletions, uniparental disomy, and imprinting defects - such patients will have only unmethylated SNRPN (small nuclear ribonuclear protein-associated polypeptide N) alleles (normally would be one maternal methylated and one paternal unmethylated)
*FISH
**Performed if DNA methylation analysis is positive to look for deletion in 15q11-q13
**May do FISH testing first for children over 5 years of age with classical symptoms and hypopigmentation
*DNA polymorphism analysis
**Can distinguish between uniparental disomy and imprinting defects
**Used if FISH analysis is normal but DNA methylation is positive
*UBE3A sequence analysis
**Performed if DNA methylation analysis is normal
**Identifies UBE3A mutations not detected by other methods
*High resolution chromosome analysis
**Can detect rare chromosomal rearrangement that will alter recurrence risk
**Should be performed for all patients
* EEG (electroencephalography)
** 2-3 Hz large-amplitude slow waves
**normal EEG does not exclude diagnosis

==Diagnosis==
*Combination of clinical features, molecular genetic testing, and cytogenetic analysis
*Unique clinical features not apparent until about 1 year old
**Developmental delay first noted at 6 months
**Can take several years until diagnosis is apparent

==Differential diagnosis==
*Prader-Willi syndrome
**Also has deletion in 15q11-q13
**Distinguished by parent-specific methylation studies
*Inborn error of metabolism or oxidative phosphorylation ruled out by testing
*Rett syndrome (in females)
**Rett syndrome patients do not have characteristic happy personality
**Angelman syndrome does not cause neurological regression
*Mowat-Wilson syndrome
** typical dysmorphic face pattern
*22q13 deletion
*X-linked alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome (ATR-X) (in males)
**small triangular nose + tenting of the upper lip

==Risk for family members==
*Risks to siblings depends on genetic cause of syndrome
**3-5 MB deletion
***Sibling risk &lt;1%
***Mothers should have chromosomal analysis to look for balanced translocation
**Unbalanced chromosomal translocation or inherited small interstitial deletion
***Sibling risk as high as 50%
***Depends on whether rearrangement is inherited or de novo
**Paternal uniparental disomy
***Sibling risk &lt;1% if no translocation
***Risk 100% if father has 15;15 Robertsonian translocation
***Fathers should have chromosomal analysis
**Imprinting defect
***Sibling risk 50% for defect in imprinting center if mother also has defect in imprinting center
***Risk about &lt;1% if imprinting defect does not involve deletion of imprinting center
**UBE3A mutation
***Sibling risk as high as 50% if mother also has a mutation
***Can also be de novo mutation 
**&quot;Other&quot; mutations
***Most cases are not familial 
***Risk may be as high as 50% 
*Prenatal testing
**High risk
***Includes:
****Parents with one child with AS caused by deletion or uniparental disomy for reassurance
****Parents with one child with AS caused by a UBE3A mutation even if mother has tested negative for the mutation as she may be mosaic
****Testing for an inherited translocation involving chromosome 15 by FISH, DNA methylation, or polymorphism analysis (parent-of-origin studies)
***Should only be done once genetic cause of syndrome has been established
***Amniocentesis or CVS
***Genetic alterations in 15q11-q13 detected by FISH/chromosomal analysis and/or DNA testing
**Low risk
***No family history of Angelman syndrome
***Should be considered in several cases
****If cytogenetic studies from CVS or amniocentesis indicate 15q11-q13 deletion, FISH or parent-of-origin studies can be done
****If trisomy 15 or mosaic trisomy 15 is detected on CVS but amniocentesis reveals 46 chromosomes, parent-of-origin studies can be done
****If de novo translocation of chromosome 15 or dicentric chromosome 15 marker is detected, FISH and parent-of-origin studies can be considered

==Management==
*Multidisciplinary child development team care
*Seizures treated with anticonvulsant medications
*Developmental delay requires educational training and therapy
**Physical therapy
**Occupational therapy
*Speech therapy focusing on non-verbal methods of communication
**Picture cards or communication boards
**Sign language
**Individualized education program
*Hyperactivity
**Behavioral modification effective to prevent disruptive or dangerous behaviors
**Some may benefit from use of stimulant medications (Ritalin)
*Sleep disorders may require sedative or administration of melatonin before bed
*Feeding problems may require special strategies to deal with weak sucking or gastroesophageal reflux
*Strabismus needs surgical repair
*Orthotic bracing or surgery for orthopedic problems
*Scoliosis may require bracing or surgical rod stabilization
*Dietary monitoring if excessive appetite

==Psychosocial/genetic counseling issues==
*Family reaction: guilt, sadness, anger, fear, denial, shock, relief
*Financial pressures
*Lifelong management
*Concerns about future pregnancies

==Contracting==
*Acknowledge prior phone contact
*What questions or concerns would you like to address today?
*Overview of agenda for the session

==Intake and Family History==
*Pregnancy and medical history
**Maternal fever or viruses during pregnancy?
**Oligohydramnios or unusually shaped uterus? (Crumply ears, thin or hyperextensible skin?)
**Was the baby active throughout the pregnancy?
**Any problems with hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, jaw, or back?
**Any muscle weakness or hypotonia?
**Has she had any muscle biopsies or other blood tests to rule out possible disorders?
*Family history

**Anyone with any muscular dystrophy, muscle disease, muscle weakness?
**Anyone with cleft lip and/or palate, hearing loss, mental retardation?

==Etiology==
*Condition describing the presence of multiple joint contractures at birth
**Joint contractures are limitations in the range of motion of joints
**May affect few or all joints to varying degrees
***Includes hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, feet, and knees
***Severe cases may include the jaw and back
*Can be caused by anything that prevents normal joint movement before birth
**When joint is not moved, extra connective tissue may grow around it and fix it in position
**Tendons connecting to joint not stretched to normal length, making joint movement difficult
*Four possible reasons for limitation of joint movement prenatally
**Muscles do not develop properly (atrophy)
***Muscle diseases, including congenital muscular dystrophies
***Maternal fever during pregnancy
***Viruses that damage cells transmitting nerve impulses to muscle
**There is not sufficient room in the uterus for normal movement
***Oligohydramnios
***Abnormally shaped uterus that causes crowding
**Central nervous system or spinal cord malformations
**Tendons, bones, joints, or joint linings don't develop properly

**Escobar Syndrome
***Autosomal recessive condition
***Thick skin folds keep joints in fixed position
***Restrict joint motility in neck, axilla, antecubital, popliteal, and digital areas
*Neurological Abnormalities
**Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13
***Cause distal arthrogryposis
***Causes severe mental retardation and facial dysmorphism

**May be accompanied by other conditions tat complicate the picture
**Outlook is generally very positive
*Not a progressive condition
**Substantial improvements seen with treatment
**Most individuals are of normal intelligence and lead independent lives as adults
*Possible features

**Splints can augment stretching to increase range of motion
**Casting can improve foot position
**Removable splint such as bi-valve cast or wearing splint at night often still allows motion and stretching
*Surgeries
**Usually considered supportive measure to other forms of treatment
**Performed on ankles to put feet in weight-bearing position
**Tendon transfers can sometimes improve muscle function

==Psychosocial Issues==

The system uses the loopback interface &quot;lo0&quot; to talk to itself. Most systems automatically configure it at boot. Talking-to-oneself is useful for testing servers, and also for any situation where the server and client are on the same computer. (For example, some computer games have a one-player mode where server and client are on the same computer. These games use the &quot;network&quot;, but because there is only one computer, they use the loopback interface.)

Use the '''ifconfig''' command to check the status of the interface. It probably looks something like:
 $ '''ifconfig lo'''
 lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 33224
         groups: lo
         inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
         inet6 ::1 prefixlen 127
         inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5

The IPv4 address of your computer is &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;. This is in addition to any address that it has on an actual network. In fact, every computer calls itself &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;, so it is impossible to use this address to communicate between computers. (Some jokes involve a person who is given &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; as an attack target and proceeds to destroy their own computer.)

If your system is running an IPv6 stack, then your IPv6 loopback address is &quot;::1&quot;. The computer should be able to use IPv6 to communicate with itself, even if it has no connection to an actual IPv6 network.

You probably have no problem pinging the interface with '''ping''' or '''ping6'''. We use &quot;ping -c3&quot; and &quot;ping6 -c3&quot; to ping 3 times; otherwise it would ping every second until you interrupted with '''^C''' (CTRL+C).
 $ '''ping -c3 127.0.0.1'''
 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.206 ms

===Create interfaces===
If you want to use a fake network interface, you often must create it with &quot;ifconfig create&quot;.

Some interfaces that you might be able to create: bridge, carp, gif, gre, lo, ppp, pppoe, sl, trunk, tun, vlan.

== Forking of Wikipedia content ==

I've been following the [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion]] page and there was one Wikibook that I actually fell in love with that has been deleted.  The reference (before deletion) was [[Nikola Tesla]].  I did object to its deletion, and may still file a protest in [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]].  I'm here in the staff lounge to address the larger issue.

I understand the basic idea of Wikibooks, and have contributed to several here.  I do think that many people contributing here don't totally understand the differences between Wikibooks and Wikipedia, and often contribute &quot;articles&quot; rather than &quot;book modules&quot;.  Simply writing something here at Wikibooks is not a substitute for writing a Wikipedia article instead.

In the case of the above mentioned book, however, it was quite a bit more.  The content of the Wikipedia article about Nikola Tesla has been growing quite a bit, and due to the content length, an effort was made to move some of that content over to Wikibooks.  There was an [[w:Talk:Nikola_Tesla|editorial dispute]] in part due to the length of the article, and I don't want to go into the details here.  On the positive side, when the move was made to Wikibooks, it was chopped into several chapters, with an excellent title page and even a good appendix section.  In short, it was a well adapted beginning of a Wikibook, IMHO.  It was also better organized and adapted into a book-like format than most Wikibooks that are considered &quot;typical&quot; here at this project.

I think the staunch objection to forks of Wikipedia articles is a bit overstated, and that there are legitimate reasons that content from Wikipedia articles could be used to be the kernel of a new Wikibook, where added content that would not fit a Wikipedia article due to length or other editing issues at Wikipedia.  Certainly there should be no objection to using material from Wikipedia to create a new Wikibook.

The added issue of biographies here at Wikibooks is also unreasonable.  I don't see any legitimate reason why a good biography shouldn't be a Wikibook, and there are numerous &quot;educational&quot; reasons why learning about the lives of various famous people could and should be included here.

My question to the Wikibooks community is:  When should a &quot;fork&quot; of Wikipedia content be considered legitimate for the creation of a new Wikibook?  Can Wikipedia content be used to create a stub for a new Wikibook?   [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 7 July 2005 14:05 (UTC)

:Basically the idea is that a Wikibooks page shouldn't just be the Wikipedia article with fifteen extra paragraphs, as it is not only immediately redundant (unless greatly expanded beyond that) but will also get quickly out-of-date as editors focus their attention on Wikipedia. It needs to be as fat and detailed as possible (without unnecessary &quot;cruft&quot; of course), while Wikipedia aims to be as ''brief'' and detailed as possible. You need to establish the fork as something on its own while going into depth far beyond what an encyclopedia could possibly cope with.
:Also you must ensure that the scope and perspective are not different from WP's version. For example say I take an oversized edit to the Controversy section of the [[w:Abortion]] article and pad it out tenfold for an Abortion-focused Wikibook. The problem is, if I don't write about the other topics as well, even if briefly, it would make it seem as if abortion being wrong and evil was the only way of thinking! If you see what I mean.
:The main problem with biographies is no doubt that they will inevitably end up being based on the dreaded Original Research. Also most biographies state the author's opinion, whereas the Wiki ideal is to present ''other'' biographers' opinions.
:I'd say you can use a WP article as a stub as long as you ''do'' something with it. If it just sits here for a few months after you've lost the urge to expand it, that's not good. My suggestion, and indeed what I'm doing as we... um... &quot;read&quot;, is to work on a new Wikibook entirely offsite until such time as it goes far beyond what the WP article currently covers or will ''ever'' cover. If I lose the urge to work on it and it remains a crappy stub, I'll just file it away somewhere and maybe work on it later. If I keep going, I'll eventually post it here.
:That's the problem. If I took a section from WP and posted it here right now and ''then'' made slow progress on book-ising it, someone's bound to take one look and decide to kill it off.
:Anyway, hope that answers all your questions. Gee, almost lunchtime, I hope I just made sense... :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 7 July 2005 23:50 (UTC)

::It occurs to me that you will always get duplicated content between Wikipedia and Wikibooks. I suspect most of the books on this site have corresponding articles on Wikipedia, and you may still get the forking-problem, in the sense that both will contain information not present in the other. The fundamental problem here is that by defining Wikibooks and Wikipedia to be authoritative places for information on the same range of topics, there is an inherent ambiguity as to where the text on the subject should correctly go.

::Surely the more sensible approach would be to first write a Wikipedia article, then should the article expand to the size suitable for a book, the whole lot is transferred over here, and use interwiki linking from Wikipedia (i.e completely remove ALL content from Wikipedia). After a while, Wikipedia would die off, and Wikibooks would be left with a fully comprehensive bookshelf. And if you have that, why do you even need an encyclopedia?

::In reality, some entries on Wikipedia would never grow large enough to warrant a whole book on the subject, in the same way that some Wiktionary entries will never warrant a Wikipedia article.

::If it seems a bit harsh to remove the Wikipedia entry to make a book, then perhaps the content should be copied to Wikibooks, and then summarized in the Wikipedia article, making it very clear where the book is, and that all future content should go there, not on Wikipedia itself.

::Main problem is that all the wikis are trying to achieve the same thing at the conceptual level, and could all be merged. They're all hosted from the same database servers, using the same apache servers and the same squid proxies, so why are they all separate systems? I guess it would be an administrative nightmare, but I could imagine the &quot;one big wiki&quot; approach to work quite well. Perhaps the set of PHP scripts isn't quite up to the challenge. I really don't know.

::[[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 02:34 (UTC)

:::The point I was trying to make, particularly with the Nikola Tesla Wikibook I mentioned, was that it was approaching the size that editors were culling information from the Wikipedia article to try and make it smaller.  The amount of content certainly was not an issue in this case, and indeed was a part of the editorial dispute at Wikipedia.  Yes, there was a NPOV issue, but that was not the primary reason for deleting this Wikibook.

:::The only reason given for deleting this content here on Wikibooks was '''strictly''' because it was a fork of Wikipedia content.  That seemed as though it was sufficient grounds to kill the entire Wikibook.  I will be the first to admit that it was slightly sparse for a Wikibook, but not significantly so.  For a Wikipedia entry it was more than comprehensive, and indeed a featured article because of how comprehensive it had become.

:::In addition, the argument that you shouldn't post content here on Wikibooks until you have the whole book written is also unjustified.  Most Wikibooks start out as stubs that are substantially shorter than even the Wikipedia articles they supposedly are related to.  The whole point of using a Wiki here is to collaboratively build content.  Yes, if you let a Wikibook sit and languish its content will go stale, and there are numerous examples of that here as well.  Based on this standard, more than a 1/3rd of all the Wikibooks should be deleted right now, including some that I occasionally contribute to.

:::As far as keeping a Wikibook up to date with content on Wikipedia, I think that over time (and enough eyeballs) that will happen.  This is mainly an issue for how much will Wikibooks as a project mature over time and how many people will be participating here.

:::Again, in this situation, there was hardly any time between when it was posted on Wikibooks and when it was deleted.  This certainly was not a Wikibook that languish for months on end waiting for somebody else to add content to it.  Indeed, this whole episode is befitting the life story of Nikola Tesla as somebody who just doesn't get any respect and is considered a fringe lunatic.

:::Wikibooks is not Wikipedia.  It is a totally separante project with a different community of users.  That some cross-pollination between Wikipedia and Wikibooks does occur, it is not necessarily completely identical even on the user level.  There is no reason at all to delete Wikipedia content simply because a Wikibook has been created, nor am I advocating that approach.  I'm simply suggesting that it would be reasonable and prudent to permit in some cases a legitimate forking of Wikipedia content to become a more comprehensive Wikibook on a subject.  I am also strongly suggesting that a bias against biographies is unjustified in general, and that as a textbook it has a legitimate use in education.  It can be written in a NPOV fashion, as befits a Wikimedia project, or at least have biases that any historical subject would have.

:::There is also a strange viewpoint that Wikipedia &quot;owns&quot; Wikibooks.  While I admit the user community at Wikipedia is larger and the editorial policies at Wikipedia more firmly established, there is no reason why Wikibooks always has to follow their lead.  The goals and aims of Wikibooks is quite a bit different, and even the medium in a sense is different.  Wikibooks is a lot more laid-back, where decisions take weeks or months to totally mull over.  Even the staff talk here is not culled nearly as often as it is for Wikipedia Watercooler discussions.  The #1 problem I see with people used to the rules at Wikipedia that come to Wikibooks is that they tend to write Wikibook modules like they would a Wikipedia article.

:::Finally, when deleting content the rule on the [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] page should be followed:  &quot;5. When in doubt, don't delete.&quot;  I don't think this policy was followed too closely in this case, and there are many other pages that should have been deleted instead.  There is enough outright vandalism and problems from new users creating unusable stubs to clean up that killing a valid Wikibook like this biography of Nikola Tesla was, IMHO, unjustified.

:::[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 8 July 2005 10:52 (UTC)

::::It's getting late so I'll maybe respond to all that tomorrow. Basically I think you should request the undeletion of this Wikibook, referring to your explanations here, and hopefully get some notice for your interpretation of forking. You must remember that Wikibooks is very small compared to WP, there are only a few sysops &quot;ruling the roost&quot;, so there's likely less likelihood of one spotting and/or correcting another's decision. [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 8 July 2005 11:46 (UTC)

::::I understand what you're saying, my previous reply was actually a justification for why I think you're right. I don't think anyone's just gonna start a book about Tesla on here, but a Wikipedia article is a good starting point for a book. If people want to cull parts of the article on Wikipedia, then I think it's perfectly justified to fork it to Wikibooks to avoid losing content. I guess it depends if they want to cull substantial parts of it, or just summarize the existing content without losing information. Either way, it seems as if a policy to delete forks of Wikipedia articles placed on Wikibooks will mean that no subject which has an article on Wikipedia could ever have a book on Wikibooks. This is just daft. I think the solution here is to get the book undeleted, and make it VERY clear in the Wikipedia article that the article is considered complete, and all subsequent info should go to the book. Let me know if you file an undelete request. I will support it. [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 14:33 (UTC)

:::::I'm with you, Aya.  As long as there is a clear connection between a wikibook module and the related wikipedia articles/projects -- for instance, with a little sidebar or footnote from the module to suitable articles and vice versa -- the 'forking' condition should not be a problem.  The original issue with forking, as I understand it, is that a wikibook should not be created as a way to have an 'alternate version' of a wikipedia article. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:20, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

::::::Finally. Someone understands what I'm talking about. To those who didn't &quot;get it&quot;, I might suggest reading some texts on the philosophy of language and related meaning. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 12:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

Many users here do not understand that the main objective of Wikibooks is to provide '''instructional material'''.  It doesn't matter whether you have a single page or a book that encompasses 1000 modules - the point is that if it does not intend to teach the reader, then it doesn't belong in Wikibooks.  End of story.  A lot of Wikipedians do not understand it, nor do Wiktionarians (we have had forks of their content before) and guys on Meta.  Also consider that, as of the time I write this, we only have 25 sysops and 2 bureaucrats for just under 9000 users (of which say 1000 is active on en, let's say).  The numbers game clearly shows that action takes a long time to accomplish. Also, for Rob, perhaps you should talk to [[User:Gentgeen]], who deleted the modules (Wikibookians never say article as an article is not instructional material...) and see his insights as to why he believed there was a consensus.  As for biographies, the VFD consensus seems to indicate biographies are alone not considered to be instructional material, although they can be part of one (I have a textbook on abstract algebra where short paragraph-long bios are sidebars).

: Oh I see. So a guide to cheap Japanese toys like Pokemon is more educational that a biography of a famous scientist (ideal for those studying Physics)? On which planet is this the case? - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 12:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: There are actually only [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm 1500] users who have ever made over 10 edits, across all languages. Only [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/TablesWikipediansEditsGt5.htm 450] made more than 5 edits in June; of those, 200 were editing the English wikibooks.  Considering this, 21 admins doesn't seem out of proportion; that's 1 admin for ever 10 people actively editing this month.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 06:20, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
:: The comparable stats for Wikipedia : [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesWikipediaZZ.htm 57,000] users with over 10 edits, 19,000 with over 5 edits in May; 9000 of those editing the English Wikipedia.  464 active administrators.  That's twice as many editors per administrator.  [[User:Sj|Sj]]

Point taken on the user ratios.  Still, you cited 464 active admins in Wikipedia.  How many admins are being active admins in Wikibooks (rather, how many are considered to be active)? 10 admins?  5?  Just me?  Or do you consider all 25 active? [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:31, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: Personally, I don't consider any of them particularly active, at least in the sense of their administrative duties. The speedy deletions are not being speedily deleted, the VfD contains information beyond its scope, and requests for page protections are going un-noticed. There's some talk on Meta at the moment about a new deletion system which would mostly remove the need for admins anyway. The concept of admins is flawed, since wiki is too ephemeral for these systems to work. See also [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks]]. Back to the original point, this request has been added to [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]]. I would suggest that is the proper place to discuss the book in question. As for this discussion: as long as the policy is as vague and self-contradictory as it currently stands, this debate will go on forever. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 12:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

Perhaps I'm missing something. I think I'm thinking of the reverse of Wikipedia forking in that I have a concern that there are cases where much effort could be saved by &quot;citing&quot; and linking to Wikipedia articles. Is there a problem with doing so as I see a number of cases here where texts could be improved and expanded quickly and easily by linking to a Wikipedia article.

If this is a topic that is being or has been discussed elsewhere, please let me know. Thanks. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 20:38, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

:I think the Wikipedia is a great source to start chapter- and section-stubs. But primarily a book's module and an encyclopedia article serve two different purposes. A book's purpose is to teach one specific thing very well. That means extra background information is covered in previous chapters, and only certain details are given. An encyclopedia article's purpose is to teach many topics. That means the article has a high degree of linkage and little or no emphasis for &quot;what is already known&quot; verus &quot;what isn't already known.&quot; I think the two complement each other well. You can browse many subjects on the Wikipedia to determine a specific subject you'd like to know in depth (so you read the book), or you can read a wikibook and then learn about all of the related subjects in the wikipedia.

:In that light, I think it's more appropriate for books to include &quot;further reading&quot; sections that include Wikipedia links. I don't think it's generally useful to include links as a primary means to writing a book. Instead, what is said at the link should be said in the book itself! A lot of the information can be removed (i.e., that which is not important) and it resolves the questions &quot;if I follow this link, do I need to follow what it links to too?&quot; and &quot;do I need to follow this link, or can I understand the book without it?&quot; by making them moot. It also allows people to print out the books and have them be completely independent. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:27, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:Thank you for your thoughts on this. Yes, I've been getting that impression: better to move things into a book to make it complete rather than link. 

So I'll do that with the things I've been planning to contribute too (if I can ever find the administrator to double check my plans). 

As an asside, I'm of two minds, and my thinking is based on pragmatism. There are some subjects, like history, or the book I started on Blacksmithing where moving articles into a Wikibook makes a lot of sense as the information is fairly static and there is good reason for readers to make hard copies on occasion. However, with other topics I could see where using links extensively would make more sense, where the material was subject to frequent revision. Some of that could be taken care of with a &quot;for further information&quot; section. As an example, if I were working on a more technical book, where several of the components might have revision cycles measured in weeks or months, my inclination would be to build modules around a link or links to the pertinent information and in the module give the context and concepts necessary to interpret the more volatile information found at the link.

I'll admit one of the reasons why linking is attractive is the 32kb limit. There are times it seems like one is back in the '80s writing a book on Wordstar and running into the 64kb maximum file size. You have to link anyway, so the inclination is to link to something already there. FWIW. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 18:20, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:Eventually books can and should be broken up into chapters, and even subchapters, if the content gets too long. But using transclusion you can make an uberpage where if you visit it you can see all of the modules as a single page (this is great for printing or for saving as HTML to be imported into OpenOffice). Editing the uberpage would just show what is effectively a list of links to the modules, but instead of being a link the content at the link is &quot;transcluded&quot; in place. An example can be found [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Full Text|here]]. Click on the top &quot;edit this page&quot; tab to see how it was done.

:As for technical books, I think the primary reason someone would read it is to learn the subject. In those cases, it's much more important to teach the basics and then fundamentals first before discussing the latest fad. The goal should be that after the material is understood, the reader could then go and read the documentation for, say, the latest library changes and understand how to use it. But providing high-quality links is hard too: the content at links can change, and you need to be aware if some concept is no longer discussed, or a more difficult concept is discussed where background would be neccessary. Personally I think a heavily-linked organization is great for some kinds of information, but it is very poor for learning, which instead of heavy-linking more requires a very linear explaination. (Some textbooks are only somewhat linear, in that they include chapters that aren't required, or allow some chapters to be read in any order, but even then the prereqs are spelled out.) Perhaps if there was an equivalent of footnotes it would be better to include links there, because then it's clearer the link is only tangental (and if it wasn't tangental, then it should be part of the book itself, or part of another book that's required reading first). --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:45, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== A proposal to unite the C++ books? ==

I posted this on the forking policy discussion page but got no replies, so I'll post here. If this has been suggested already then pardon me for proposing it again. 

My idea is to have the two books to share a front page asking the user whether or not he/she wants to have a C++ textbook broken down into parts or learn from one single page (or however you want to phrase it, it's all up to you). Two links could then be posted on the page, one to a subsection that has the contents of the textbook now known as &quot;C Plus Plus&quot; and one to a subsection has the contents of the book now known as &quot;C -/- -/-&quot; (making the current textbooks subsections to a single book is key here). This way, development can continue into two separate directions, the book can be found using one search term, the end user has more choice, and most of all, you can heal the fork. 

I look forward to hearing your opinions on this. --[[User:64.231.220.14|64.231.220.14]] 00:42, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

:Page naming aside, that solution is basically what we've got already. I would rather see a true merge done. Until someone can give me a single and undisputable convincing reason why you ''can't'' have them as one book and make the &quot;all on one page&quot; view using transclusions, I'm afraid I will still stand by my belief that they ought to be completely merged sooner than later, even forcibly if it must come to that.

:There doesn't need to be a separate page to ask the reader if they want a single page or a set of buckets. Simply do what the [[Computer Science:Data Structures]] book does and provide the list of chapters, but include a link to an [[Computer_Science:Data_Structures:All_Chapters|all chapters view]] too. Take a look at the source to see how the transclusions are done. Why was this forked in the first place? [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:46, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

::From what I've been able to gather (it's discussed in like ten places) the one author wanted to write a single page uber tome and the other wanted shorter descriptions on individual pages. Or something like that. They were just unable to reach an agreement on the organisation of the book so he suddenly forked it off so he could do things his way. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:07, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

:::But isnt the idea of chapter-sized modules the de facto wikibooks standard? I thought the idea of a single-topic &quot;uber-page&quot; was more of a wikipedia concept, and less of a wikibooks concept. Uber-pages take long to load, and are more difficult to navigate. Also, i can't think of a single reason why we would need 2 books on C++. I vote that we begin a process of forced-merge on these articals, working to create a more &quot;wikibooks friendly&quot; chapter format.--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 13:55, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

== Babel ==

I think that we should use the improved language templates from [[Wikipedia:Babel|Wikipedia:Babel]]. Currently at Wikibooks three levels are used (from 1-basic to 3-fluent), but including a specific tag for native speakers is a good idea.
Also, I've just created the babel templates (see [[Wikipedia:Babel|Wikipedia:Babel]]):
* [[Template:Babel-1]]
* [[Template:Babel-2]]
* [[Template:Babel-3]]
* [[Template:Babel-4]]
If somebody speaks more than four languages feel free to add additional templates. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:58, August 31, 2005 (UTC)
:I think it would be a good idea to have a separate page for babel, where we can discuss it, and where we can list the templates that are usable with it. Wikipedia has alot of little babel templates for different languages, but also for different computer languages, web browsers, etc... The babel format could be used to express a very large amount of information about a user, and we should probably have a centralized resource for babel. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 14:56, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== Game manual @ Wikibooks? ==

I'm currently working on a game manual for the computer simulation [http://www.liveforspeed.net/ Live for Speed]. I've set up my own [http://lfs-old.4players.de:1043/lfswiki/ LFS Manual Wiki] but I'm thinking about publishing the whole manual at Wikibooks to open it to a wider audience. So my question is, whether a game manual is suited for Wikibooks or not?

:In the past, such manuals have been accepted on Wikibooks, but I get the impression that this may change shortly. Try http://gameinfo.wikicities.com/ - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:52, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

::Out of curiosity.... who is complaining about game books on Wikibooks?  While they are not textbooks in a normal sense, shy of creating a whole new Wikimedia project I don't see any other place to put them either.  There is a half-started attempt to create a Wikimedia project for game books, but I don't see it going anywhere at the moment, particularly with the flack that seems to be coming about Wikiversity.  See [[meta:Proposals for new projects#WikiGameGuides]] for the few details about the idea.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:03, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Hi Rob. I'm not complaining how game books ''perse'', but I think wikicities would be a better location for them. Here's why: (1) the books are very popular and generate a lot of hits, hosting them on WC will generate more revenue for them, which indirectly helps WB. (2) while they are how-tos on computer software, they aren't exactly a guide on how to use Open Office, so the &quot;textbook&quot; interpretation of it is really stretching it. (3) It would probably give WC a good boost in the arm, by increasing the number of attractive and interesting things on it. So, we don't need a whole new wikimedia project for it, WC is fine (which technically isn't part of wikimedia as a understand it, though the software and some of the people are the same). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:43, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

::::I'm personally very conflicted on the idea of having game manuals on wikibooks. On one hand, a game manual would definately benefit from the &quot;book environment&quot; of wikibooks, as opposed to the &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude at WC. Having items about popular culture here would also increase WB readership and participation. However, Game manuals are certainly not textbooks. They are only instructive to the players of that particular game, and will not teach greater lessons, in the way that other &quot;classic instructional&quot; wikibooks will. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 15:02, 11 October 2005 (UTC)

== Please delete moved material (admins). ==

Hello. The [[Mishnah]] texts have been moved to [[:s:|English Wikisource]].

Admins - the current [[Mishnah]] page has links to exact lists of all related pages. All of these have been copied and all of them can be deleted.

If its OK, the best thing would be to leave the current [[Mishnah]] page as a redirect to Wikisource.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 08:37, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:Interwiki redirects are bad.  The user clicks what looks like an internal link, yet ends up on another project.  They're also hard to find later. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:44, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

::Not that important. Main thing is that the pages be deleted.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 10:26, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

:Note that the canonical way to get pages deleted is to add the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to the top of them. See [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions]] for details. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:40, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

== Table of Contents ==

Is it possible to have a section heading which does not appear in the table of contents.  If not then I guess I have to maintain the TOC manually?

I ask because in the calculus book there are a lot of examples, and the TOC gets too long.

Thanks [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 15:09, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

:There's no way to exclude headers from the TOC as yet, so you'll have to turn it off completely and make your own. Just type &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; somewhere on the page to remove it. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:57, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

No no no, for god sake just use HTML. Bold the header, and make it header 4 or header 3 &quot;&lt; h4 &gt;&quot; &quot;&lt; b &gt;&quot; after the header write &quot;&lt; /b &gt;&quot; (by the way, write all of those without the spaces i put in) - it won't appear in the table of contents, and it WILL be bold and larger. Turning the table of contents off makes your books very hard to use. [[User:Fresheneesz|Fresheneesz]]

== Request for comment ==

I've posted this request here as I haven't located a Wikibooks RfC page. Apologies if I've managed to miss it somehow.

I have for a while now been engaged in a discussion - well, it feels more like an exchange - with [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] as regards the nature of the [[:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight|About gravity, mass, and weight]] module in the [[:Wikijunior Solar System]] book. I think the time has been ripe for comments, suggestions and advice from other people, so would appreciate it if people would pay it and [[Talk:Wikijunior Solar System/About gravity, mass, and weight#Rewrite?|our discussion]] a visit to help resolve what I fear may become an impasse. Thank you.

== Missing article ==

Ok -- I'm new here. 

To practice, I put comments into a Travel Guide about Costa Rica.  I forgot to sign in before I did that, so I can't check my history.  Now I can't find any travel guide on Costa Rica.  I'm 61 years old and maybe I'm getting senile but I'm not hallucinating.  Maybe this was in a different wiki project, but I can't find it there, either.  I checked deletions to see if someone tossed it, but no luck.  

Ok you experienced people please tell me what I am missing here. I hope it is not my brain. 

Thanks 

--[[User:Frog One|Frog One]] 02:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:COuld you possibly have been editing wikitravel?  They have one for Costa Rica at http://wikitravel.org/en/Costa_Rica --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

:No, you are not going senile.  There is a group of editors here that feel it is inappropriate for travel guides to be on Wikibooks.  I am of a different opinion on the subject, but that is something that should be debated elsewhere for now.  If you can remember the name of the section or travel guide that was deleted, you can put up a request with the [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]] section.  The text you wrote is still in the database, but has been removed due to some cleanup.  I can even undelete it if necessary.

:Please, continue to contribute to Wikibooks, and I'm glad that you have gone the extra effort to try and find out what happened.  We are all mere mortals and sometimes get carried away deleting stuff that perhaps should be kept.  There are quite a few pages here on Wikibooks that havn't seen activity in years, and sometimes those get deleted when they don't seem to be &quot;important&quot; or don't seem to have much content.  In order to delete content, you must be an &quot;administrator&quot; here, which really only implies that it is somebody who has made some significant contributions over some time and can be trusted to help out the community.  Otherwise, it is just opinion over what should be kept and what is removed.

:As I said, we do make mistakes, and I apologize on behalf of this community if you feel this content was deleted by mistake.  If you are pretty certain that it was on Wikibooks, I'll try to dig around and see if I can find the content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:32, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

== Book Count for Wikibooks ==

I have increasingly seen a number of newspaper/magazine/blog articles about Wikibooks that seem to have mistaken the module count for the number of Wikibooks that we have here.  Numbers like 12,000 Wikibooks are thrown around when in fact I think we would be hard pressed to count more than about 100 books that are more than stubs.  And only a couple dozen books are even close to a &quot;publishable&quot; state.

For the sake of accuracy for media articles of this nature, as well as an indicator of the effectiveness of this project, I would like to see some &quot;metric&quot; that could be developed to count the number of actual Wikibooks we have on this project.  Counting the number of books on [[Main Page]] is one way to do it, but even that seems to not be accurate.  Another issue to consider is how would we be able to automate that calculation?  That certainly would be an interesting statistic to keep updated on the main page as well.  I'm not proposing MediaWiki software changes here, although that could also be a possibility.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:23, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

:Well, if people are using those % finished images, you could have a perl script read the bookshelves, and count the number with each image after them.  That would give you a rough count of how many and what stage.  Pseudocode looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
read list of bookshelves from a config file
foreach bookshelf
  read in the bookshelf text from cur table
  foreach line in text
    check if there is a link to a wikibooks book
    if so, check if there is an image link after it.
    record book name and image in a hash table.  For quick counts, add it to some running totals
we now have a list of all books and their image percent.  Script needs to report this somehow-  mail an admin or post it on the front page maybe?
&lt;/pre&gt;

That might be good enough for a rough estimate.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 09:10, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

: Well, if people were using the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm statistics] would show a correct list. Currently, there are over 290 ''Books larger than 10 Kb and more than one chapter'', but it is clear there are false books in the list and other books are not been counted because they don't follow any naming convention, e.g. [[Linux Guide]] (I regard this book as broken) or followed the bookshelf convention, e.g. [[C++ Programming|Programming:C Plus Plus]] and consequently were counted as pages, not books. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 01:45, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

:: True - the stats will find any book which follows the naming convention and if you don't follow: tuff luck. I  too would say that the stats are the way to go --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:14, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

==[[Internet Server Directory]] and Wikibooks of lists ==

I was thinking of making this a VfD discussion, and it may end up becoming that shortly, but I wanted to put this into a forum that was less threatening to start with.  This Wikibook, [[Internet Server Directory]], is a list of links to servers for various resources on the internet.  This Wikibook is making me eat my words I wrote on [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a repository of links]] but I'm willing to suggest I spoke in haste.

The real question I'm placing before Wikibooks contributors and the community at large is this:  Is it appropriate to have a repository of links or a bunch of lists on Wikibooks?

I think a module that has a bunch of links at the end for &quot;further reading&quot; is very useful.  For example, [[Wikijunior Solar System]] has a bunch of links at the end of the main page for gathering content and to use for bibliographic references.  Where I have a problem with this is when the sole purpose of the Wikibook is just to make a collection of links or a list of topics.  I know Wikipedia has been kicking those type of articles off of Wikipedia and they have been going elsewhere on the Wikimedia projects, so I guess Wikibooks is the next target to try.

Should [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] be changed to stop lists and Wikibooks that are just links to other places?  This Wikibook about Internet servers is now forcing the issue and will require us to decide one way or the other.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:05, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:There is, of course, a fine line to be drawn here.  For instance the book on free software (which looks quite good) is based around a collection of links.  The value of the book, of course, is the organisation.  In the case of the server directory it seems the organisation is sparse but then again the book is quite new.  Just my 2 cents [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 03:24, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

:This is not a book, nor does it appear to aspire to become one. Unless the author can explain that its purpose is something other than as a web directory, we will have to delete it. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:29, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== Is this legal? ==
[[Emulation:All_Mame_Roms]]
is it?
[[User:81.218.224.11|81.218.224.11]] 14:36, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm having some strong doubts on this.  Discussing how to burn ROMs for games is not strictly illegal, nor is talking about bit torrent archives.  Where it crosses the line is to provide a list of commercial software that is under propritary licenses and suggesting that you can copy that software freely as well.  That is where this turns into advocacy that commits a crime that can land you in prison.  I would not personally want to be the &quot;author&quot; of this Wikibook, nor touch it so far as that goes as it could result in legal liability, particularly if it can be proven that somebody followed these steps.

I'm moving this to a [[VfD]] discussion right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:15, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

== Download books as PDF ==

Hi there.

I (that's [[:de:Benutzer:Manuel Strehl|Manuel Strehl]] from the German WB) proposed in the German WB a possibility for allowing people to download complete books in PDF format and wanted it to come up to discussion in a broader scope.

===Proposal===
Use XSL-FO and Apache's Open Source FOP to produce PDFs out of Wikibook's raw data. Provide a link for visitors to allow them to download the complete book they're currently reading.

Following procedure:
* Read the MySQL data of the current page, add the data of all pages of the same book.
* parse it into a XSL-FO file (this isn't very different from parsing into XHTML) in the order they appear online
* create a PDF out of the XSL-FO using Apache's FOP ([http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/])
* this is achievable by clicking on a link provided on each page of the current book.

Disadvantages:
* one-time effort to create the PHP file and a standard XSL-FO file
* server strain

Advantages:
* create the PDF automatically out of the raw MySQL data
* complete wikibooks for download

If you want to contact me, please visit my [[w:de:Benutzer_Diskussion:Manuel Strehl|German Wikipedia discussion page]]

--Manuel, 22:18, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

:Looks like a good idea.  Certainly something like it needs to be done.  How do you get the pages in the right order?  Some of the books are not structured as linear narratives and many (most?) have three or more hierarchical levels of sections and sub-sections.  In the [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] book I have tried to add a navigation template to each page which links them all in printed page order but it is only a local convention.  I would discuss this on your German talk page but my German is next to non-existent so it would be a rather painful process for all concerned. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 12:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Herewith thou get thy special permission to write english text to my german discussion page ;-) To the problems: Actually I have no idea. There are some books in linear order that would be easily transformed. Others won't, that's true. There could be a user interface to allow one to sort them himself, but this is no really good solution. Actually, this is one of the points that must be discussed.

Other Question: Is there any other page where a similar discussion is open? At the German WB I just initialized a page for this purpose, for the discussion was led on three different pages. --Manuel, 20:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

::We have a [[Wikibooks:Textbook planning]] page, but few users are now there.

::Apparently FOP uses [[Programming:Java|Java]], but I have no idea whether this server runs Java. Wikibooks might be Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, but I am not sure. Any placement of Java on any non-[[w:x86|x86]] Linux or BSD machine is difficult; I know not what this server is.

::Assuming server can run FOP, a problem is the determination of whether a [[WB:MODULE|module]] belongs to a book. For example, [[Guide to UNIX]] links to several parts of itself, but it also has several links to other Wikibooks. A solution is to always use slash convention ([[Guide to UNIX/Introduction]]) or colon convention ([[:de:Linux-Kompendium]]) as recommended in [[WB:NP|the proposed naming policy]], but many books ([[Linux Guide]]) use neither. Also, what is the order of the chapters? The [[Guide to UNIX]] page suggests that [[Guide to UNIX/Explanations]] is before [[Guide to UNIX/Commands]], but the software might follow the Commands link in the first paragraph, or the one in the introduction, and put Commands early instead of the back of the book! --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:05, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

Data is a quantiative representation of a characterestic . Say for example if we wish to measure the sizes of files than we understand that we have to chosee a scalar and a unit. The scalar and unit measures of size are 19000 bytes, 20000 bytes. It could also be 1000LOC, 2000LOC. They are both measures but in context they are different. If I want to know the file size for storage purposes, then I must know the size in bytes. If however I want to review a document then i must know the number of standard lines. Fortunately we do have some simple calculations 
Size of an Empty word document 19456 bytes.
Size of a document with one line of standard text :19456 b
Size of a document with 4 std lines of text       : 19456 b
Size of a document with 5 std lines of text       : 19968 b
So if we go on experimenting this way we understand that file size changes by 512 bytes. If we investigate further we will find that file size is a multiple of 512 bytes. The point I am trying to make here is that for data to be relevant its absoluteness and relativeness are both important.</text>

**Retrospective. 111 patients treated with self-expandable metallic stents
**24 patients (22%) survived &gt;1 year. Dx bile duct CA or pancreatic CA. Complication duodenal obstruction
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Many patients with bile duct carcinoma and pancreas carcinoma survived for more than 1 year and adjuvant therapy should be performed to improve the survival of those patients.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've seen a lot of simplified versions of pad thai out there.  If one wanted to make this more authentic, adding tamirind paste and fish sauce in place of ketchup and vinigar would be a good idea.  I think that Tamarind and fish sauce are the key to making pad thai taste like Pad Thai

== lots of ideas for changes ==

this is a great receipe, but there are quite a few weird things in it. i thought i'd list them first to see if anyone has some suggestions before just changing things around.

# 3/4 cup of oil? -- that's gross. 3-4 Tbs. seems plenty.
# what is &quot;2 Tbs. chopped pepper&quot;? (A: dried, flaked, chopped red pepper. the hot stuff.)
# any ideas for &quot;assorted vegetables&quot;? (i put in grated carrot, and white onion.)
# do we need to say &quot;if no one is allergic&quot; in the last step? it's sort of silly -- why not include that in front of all the incredients. if no one is allergic to eggs... if no one is allergic to fish... ;)
# why is the amount 1/4 cup and 1Tbs for the vinegar and sugar? 1/4 cup is enough, no?
# anyone have thoughts on the more 'authentic' variations with tamarind?

== bold edits ==

so, i made most of these bold edits. some comments/questions:

* Anyone know the best way to add an image from wikipedia? (there is a great one on the article for [[W:pad thai|pad thai]].)

}}

This dish is the most indigenous in the Philippines. It has evolved over the centuries as a way of preparing foods that won't spoil easily in a tropical climate. The vinegar gives it the tangy taste and acts as the preservative. Each region has its own version, but the most commonly used is pork and/or chicken. The steps below is the traditional way of making adobo.

==Ingredients ==

* 6-8 chicken pieces, preferably legs and wings
* ⅓ cup (80 mL) vinegar made from coconut juice (as a variant, try balsamic vinegar)
* ¼ cup (60 mL) soy sauce
* 4 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1-2 pieces bay leaf 
* ½ tsp (2.5 mL) freshly cracked (not ground) black peppercorns

== Preparation ==
# Put chicken, garlic, peppercorn, soy sauce and vinegar in a pan and bring to a boil
# When chicken is cooked, put chicken pieces in a colander and drain. Put aside the pot with soy sauce and vinegar. 
# When chicken pieces are no longer draining, fry them in hot oil at medium heat (have a cover ready for splatters)
# Sear the chicken and brown them on all sides.
# Put chicken pieces back in the pot with soy sauce and vinegar and bring to simmer.Add 1-2 pieces of bay leaf. 
# Cook until the sauce has largely evaporated; some take this to an extreme and cook until the sauce has thickened and adhered to the chicken, which begins to make a popping noise due to the high, direct heat. 

Serve over hot steamed rice. May be eaten with tomato slices in fish sauce.

I think the sections [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/External Beam RT|External Beam RT]] and [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Localized Prostate Cancer|Localized Prostate Cancer]] have a lot of overlap and are hard to discriminate.  Both sections have papers about outcomes after EBRT and both have a section called &quot;Outcome prediction.&quot;  I'm confused about how to separate the sections and welcome any suggestions that anyone may have.  Once we get it sorted out, we should put a description for each of these pages (the others are pretty self-explanatory) on [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate]]. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 17:06, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
*Well, initially we had most of the information in the EBRT page. But, I think to be consistent with other organs, as well as from clinical utility, we created the Localized PCA/Node Positive/Metastatic disease pages. I was in the process of moving the relevant info from the EBRT page, when I got sidetracked with my current research project in cholangio. I think it's probably more relevant to have Localized PCA page, which then contains sections on surgery, EBRT, and BT (and similarly for the other disease stages). The EBRT page could hold technique specific information relevant to all disease stages. I should be finished with my cholangio/liver work over the next couple of weeks; I can return to prostate and try to organize it some more then. [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 05:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
Okay, that sounds good.  I will try to move some of the stuff over as well. &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] 01:39, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

Adaptive radiotherapy includes gating, tumor tracking, etc.
RT treatment planning has traditionally been a static process - whereby a plan is generated based on a single snapshot of the patient's anatomy and delivered over a number of weeks. 
However, IGRT approaches will most likely transform this static process into a dynamic one, whereby plans are altered throughout the treatment course or perhaps even throughout the treatment fraction.

==General Information==
*'''Michigan; 2011''' -- [http://www.ascopost.com/articles/september-15-2011/we-can-conduct-clinical-trials-of-protons.aspx ASCO Post] -- &quot;We Can Conduct Clinical Trials of Protons&quot; (Lawrence TS, ASCO Post, September 15, 2011, Volume 2, Issue 14)
**Conclusion: &quot;In my opinion, proton facilities should not be permitted to continue to produce results that cannot be distinguished—except by the far greater price—from those produced by IMRT photons. Our patients deserve true improvements in outcome, rather than the hype and added expense that currently dominates the field.&quot;

*'''Independent Journalist; 2010''' PMID 20339139 -- &quot;The proton beam debate: are facilities outstripping the evidence?&quot; (Goozner M, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Apr 7;102(7):450-3. Epub 2010 Mar 25.)
**Comment

*'''Tufts; 2009''' PMID 19755348 -- &quot;Systematic Review: Charged-Particle Radiation Therapy for Cancer.&quot; (Terasawa T, Ann Intern Med. 2009 Sep 14. [Epub ahead of print])
**Literature review. 243 articles, 185 single-institution retrospective, 9 nonrandomized trials, 8 randomized trials
**Outcome: No statistically significant or important difference in overall, cancer-specific survial or total serious adverse events
**Conclusion: Evidence is needed

*'''Royal Marsden'''
**'''2009''' PMID 19672149 -- &quot;Current clinical evidence for proton therapy.&quot; (Brada M, Cancer J. 2009 Jul-Aug;15(4):319-24.)

**'''2007''' PMID 17350945 -- &quot;Proton therapy in clinical practice: current clinical evidence.&quot; (Brada M, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 10;25(8):965-70.)
***Review

*'''Columbia; 2009''' PMID 19185838 -- &quot;Protons for radiotherapy: a 1946 proposal.&quot; (Hall E, Lancet Oncol. 2009 Feb;10(2):196.)
**Historical perspective

*'''Louisville; 2009''' PMID 19111269 -- &quot;Randomized prospective trials of innovative radiotherapy technology are necessary.&quot; (Halperin EC, J Am Coll Radiol. 2009 Jan;6(1):33-7.)
**Most important clinical problem facing radiation oncology is whether randomized prospective trials are necessary to assess innovative technologies. It is possible to identify innovations that should be required to meet the standard of proof of a benefit in a randomized prospective clinical trial before being introduced into widespread clinical practice.

*'''Yale; 2008''' PMID 19028271 -- &quot;Should proton-beam therapy be widely adopted?&quot; (Schulz RJ, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Dec 1;72(5):1307-9; discussion 1309-10.)
**Editorial (Schulz RJ): Clinical outcomes of PT generally indistinguishable from photons. Issues of capital and operating costs, and cost-effectiveness should be revisited
**Response (Suit H): Significantly less integral dose. Answers to comparative Phase III requests are readily answerable by treatment plan comparisons. Need to work on questions that are of unarguable importance, such as hypofractionation, organ tolerance, concurrent chemotherapy protocols, etc

*'''21st Century Oncology; 2008''' PMID 18954812 -- &quot;A changing paradigm in the study and adoption of emerging health care technologies: coverage with evidence development.&quot; (Wallner PE, J Am Coll Radiol. 2008 Nov;5(11):1125-9.)
**Evaluation of drivers for health care. Increased interest to generate more appropriate and usefule &quot;evidence&quot; of benefit. 
**Recommendation that &quot;coverage with evidence development&quot; could be used for proton therapy

*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18262083 -- &quot;Magical protons?&quot; (Goitein M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Mar 1;70(3):654-6.)
**Editorial. Few notes of caution about dangers of proton therapy
**Comment (Withers HR, UCLA) PMID 18954723 
**Response (Goitein M, Harvard) PMID 20159368 

*'''Harvard; 2008''' PMID 18237800 -- &quot;Should positive phase III clinical trial data be required before proton beam therapy is more widely adopted? No.&quot; (Suit H, Radiother Oncol. 2008 Feb;86(2):148-53. Epub 2008 Jan 30.)
**Distribution of biological dose superior for proton therapy in most situations. There is no medical rationale for clinical trials of protons, since they deliver lower biological dose to non-target tissues
**Conclusion: Talent, effort and funds for phase III trials should be better spent to investigate real problems

*'''Harvard/MD Anderson; 2008''' PMID 18182658 -- &quot;Should randomized clinical trials be required for proton radiotherapy?&quot; (Goitein M and Cox JD, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):175-6.)
**Editorial. Argument for protons: 1) better dose-distribution due to physical depth dose characteristics, 2) virtually no difference in tissue response per unit dose, 3) radiation delivered to normal tissues damages them. Argument against protons: 1) no randomized evidence. Editorial conclusion: Burden of proof on conventional x-ray therapy to justify that cost savings of photons are not accompanied by undesirable additional morbidity
**Patient comment (PMID 18443348): RCT in this instance do not meet equipoise; there will be lawsuits for offering ''inferior'' treatment
**Comment (Glatstein E, University of Pennsylvania) PMID 18443345: RCT should be done because there is an uncertainty about ''clinical'' benefits of protons
**Comment (Tepper JE, University of North Carolina) PMID 18443346: Need ''some'' evidence of benefit, and expensive technology should have higher standards than technology with minimal cost. At minimum, need high quality Phase II trials, which we don't have yet
**Comment (Lewis BE, UNDMJ) PMID 18443346: Financial concerns cloud the judgment of physician and hospital, both of whom stand to benefit from increased use of new expensive technologies. We must have the courage to generate high quality, disinterested, and unbiased data
**Comment (Macbeth FR, NCC Cardiff) PMID 18443346: Only evidence for superiority is base of skull cordomas and ocular tumors, but both are retrospective, and ''not proven.'' Payors (patient, insurance, HMO, taxpayers) deserve to know how much better the treatment is, given the significant expense
**Comment (Brada M, Royal Marsden) PMID 18443346: Information thus far originates from proponents of protons, with frequent commercial interest in the new equipment. Having some evidence of clinical benefit is not too much to ask
**&lt;u&gt;Rebuttal&lt;/u&gt; (Goitein &amp; Cox,) PMID 18443346: We need to move beyond fixation on RCT and get on with the business of designing, funding, and conducting large-scale clinical studies using ethically defensible methodologies that would have the broad acceptance of our patients

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;{{Using FirefoxTOC}}&lt;/div&gt;

==What are tabs?==
Firefox has been designed to be useable by any user immediately--with no learning curve.  However, to truly &quot;rediscover the web&quot;, you should become comfortable with Firefox's advanced features. One of these is the use of tabs. Firefox uses &quot;tabs&quot; to show multiple web pages in the same window. Several other web browsers, such as Internet Explorer 7 and Opera, also use tabs.

[[Image:FirefoxTabs.png|right|thumb|400px|The default look of Firefox, with tabs visible]] 

Tabs are featured underneath the Location and Bookmarks Toolbars, in a file folder-like layout. Tabs allow users to have one Firefox window in the taskbar, with multiple web pages open within that window. In the image, the default Firefox homepage is shown in the first tab, and [http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html Firefox Central] (accessed from the &quot;Getting Started&quot; bookmark) is shown in the second. The number of tabs that can be opened at any one time is unlimited, though the tab bar can only hold around 20 tabs comfortably. Also, Firefox does not display the tab bar unless more than one tab is open (there is an option to change this).

==Create, close, and select tabs==
There are many different ways to both create, close, and access tabs. First, a new blank tab can be created by clicking on ''File'' &amp;rarr; ''New Tab'', or by using the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl]+[T]. If the tab bar is visible, an empty space (i.e., one not occupied by a tab) can be right clicked, and &quot;New Tab&quot; will create a new tab. Similarly, double clicking an empty space on the tab bar will create a new blank tab. Another way to create a tab, arguably the most common, is by clicking the middle mouse button (sometimes referred to as the third mouse button, or scroll wheel) on any link or bookmark (for instance, &quot;Getting Started&quot; in the above image).  Finally, holding down the [Ctrl] key and left clicking a link will open that website in a new tab.

There are also a variety of different ways to close tabs. First, ''File'' &amp;rarr; ''Close'' or [Ctrl]+[W] will close the currently selected tab. Also, the red &quot;x&quot; on the right edge of the tab bar will close the current tab. Finally, middle clicking on any tab (it doesn't have to be selected), or right clicking and selecting &quot;Close Tab&quot; will close whichever tab was selected.

Finally, there are a few different ways to select tabs. The most obvious is to simply left click on a tab. However, a keyboard shortcut also exists: [Ctrl]+[Number] where &quot;Number&quot; is any number 1-9. The corresponding tab will then be selected. Of course, this only works for the first 9 tabs opened. Another common keyboard shortcut is [Ctrl]+[Tab]. This will make the next tab active. Using [Ctrl][Shift]+[Tab] will select the previous tab. These shortcuts are an easy way to cycle through the currently open web pages.

A new feature in Firefox 1.5 is the ability to &quot;Drag and Drop&quot; tabs. By clicking and holding down the left mouse button on a tab, it is possible to change the order of tabs or put them on a different Firefox window. Once the desired location is found (as signaled by an arrow), the left button can be released, and the tab will be moved.

In addition to basic functionality, there are many other ways to use tabs.

==Customization==
For Tab preferences, see the chapter on [[Using Firefox/Preferences#Tabs | Preferences]].

==Multiple home pages==
Tabbed browsing also enables another feature: multiple home pages. With multiple home pages, it is possible to have several pages open each time the browser is opened or the &quot;Home&quot; button is selected.

To set multiple home pages, go to the &quot;Preferences&quot; window, accessible from ''Tools'' &amp;rarr; ''Options'' on Windows, ''Edit'' &amp;rarr; ''Preferences'' on Linux, or ''Firefox'' &amp;rarr; ''Preferences'' on OS X. Once in the Preferences window, select the ''General'' panel, and type each URL, separated by a pipe character (which is ''|''), in the ''Home Page'' box. For example:

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://addons.mozilla.org/|http://www.google.com|http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Randompage&lt;/nowiki&gt;

An easier way to set multiple homepages is to open all of the desired sites in tabs (making sure '''only''' the desired sites are opened) and then click the ''Use Current Pages'' button from the ''General'' tab of the ''Preferences'' window.

==Bookmark Groups==
Bookmarks Groups are very similar to Multiple Home pages. Bookmark Groups create a folder with multiple related (or unrelated, even) bookmarks. It is then possible to open all of them at once by clicking on the created folder and clicking ''Open in Tabs''. Alternately, you can simply open just one of the bookmarked web sites. To create a Bookmark Group, simply open each desired site in its own tab (again, be sure to '''only''' open the sites you'd like in the group). From there, a few ways exist to create a group:
*Right click on a tab and select ''Bookmark All Tabs...''
*Click on ''Bookmarks'' &amp;rarr; ''Bookmark All Tabs...''
*Hit [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[D]

No matter which way you create the group, the same window will appear, asking you for a name and where to create the group.

==Middle click to close tabs on Linux==
When using Firefox on Linux, the default behavior when middle clicking is to try to load whatever is currently in the clipboard as if it were a URL. If you prefer to use the middle click to close tabs, type ''about:config'' in the location bar and hit enter.

In the new window that appears, type ''middlemouse.contentLoadURL'' in the box labeled ''Filter:''. Then, right click on the preference, and select ''Toggle'', which should set the preference to '''false'''. 

(''Another contributor writes:'' Unfortunately, in some versions---
such as the one I'm using now---this simply causes Firefox to do ''nothing'' when you middle-click a tab. 'Twould be nice to figure out how to really fix this!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've never installed Firefox on OS X, and I don't really like the current directions for Linux. I might change those to use the non-installer version of Firefox (just for Linux), because the Linux installer is terrible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Firefox's &quot;main competitor&quot; isn't IE but Opera. Opera has very similar features to Firefox, including the Multiple Document Interface and it is used in a similar manner. Opera has the great advantage that it is more useable and that it is correctly configured out of the box. For instance, if you install the &quot;automatic save tab history&quot; extension then it still won't get you the full functionality you get with Opera. But hey, if you're just writing a propaganda piece then go right ahead. [[User:24.43.210.202|24.43.210.202]] 00:19, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
:I'd love for Opera to actually be Firefox's main competitor, but marketshare is all that really matters. Really, it should read that Firefox is IE's main competition, since IE still has more people using it. Opera could be the greatest browser ever, but if it doesn't have users, then it doesn't matter. --[[User:Steeler fan|Steeler fan]] 01:14, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Modes are the most common values in a [[data set]].

Example:
Of the data set 
 
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6
 
'''4''' is the mode because there are three responses of &quot;4&quot; and only one response for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.

Data can have more than one mode, example:

Of the data set

1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6.

'''2''' and '''5''' are the modes because they are equally the most frequent.

[[Histograms]] can often be a good way to see if large data sets have more than one mode.

== The Constraint ==
A constraint is what makes everything easier, magic, automatic, customised (add more words here) in a rig. It tells a bone or an object to do something special based on the position of another object, and the position of the constrained object itself. There are many constraint types for you to play with. Most will work everywhere but, the IK solver will only be available in the Armature Editmode or Posemode.

There are no strict rules to follow when using constraints. As long as they save you time and make everything work by itself. A constraint should never be &quot;time-consuming&quot; or difficult to use. Think about the animator who is going to work with this rig (it could be you!). So, do everything in a smart way.
 
It's possible to copy constraints from one object/bone to a bunch of objects/bones. A useful thing to know when doing a repetitive task like rigging all the fingers of a hand. Just select all bones/objects that you want to give a copy of the constraint, and then select the bone/object containing the constraints. Press '''SHIFT + CTRL-CKEY''' in 3DView, and select Object Constraints from the popup menu. The idea behind this is to copy the constraints of the active object to the selection.

When working on an armature in Posemode, the bones will change color if they contain a constraint. Green for almost all, except for the IK constraint, which turns the bone Yellow.

== The Constraint Panel ==
You can add a Constraint to an object or a bone by going in Object button window('''F7''') for objects and bones. Look for a Constraint panel like this (note, it's usually empty):

[[Image:Ie_constraint.jpg]]

The panel also appears in Editbutton('''F9''') when you are in Armature Editmode or Posemode.
So what you get:
*A button to add a new Constraint. The choice you have is listed down this page.
*When you add a new Constraint, A block gets added in the stack. The UI is almost the same as the Modifier Stack. Each block represents an entry. You can delete it with &quot;X&quot;, move it up or down in the stack, close or open it.
*Constraints are evaluated from first to last. So if you have two Constraints working on the same channel, let say Location, The last one will most probably win the chance to move the object. But...
*Most of the constraints have an influence slider to determine how much it will influence the stack. If the last constraint has an influence of 0.5 it will mix the result with the one before.
*You can animate the influence of the Constraint by moving the time, changing the Influence slider and adding a key with the '''Key''' button. 
*The '''Show''' button will display the influence IPO curve in an IPO window for editing. (The IPO window must be opened before pressing the 'show' button).
*You can change the name of the Constraint by clicking on the name when the constraint is open.
*By Clicking on the white jacket of the Constraint you select which one is active for edition, same as &quot;show&quot; button.
*If most of the Constraint you can enter the name of the Object you want to work with as a target or reference. For a bone, you need to enter in which Armature object it is, then an other field for the bone name will appear. When filling those fields, remember you can use autocompletion using '''TAB'''.

*'''Ohio State 1989-02''' [http://astro2005.abstractsnet.com/pdfs/abstract_2086.pdf ASTRO Abstract] ''Long Term Follow-Up of Patients of Intrahepatic Malignancies Treated with Iodine-125 Brachytherapy'' ('''2005 Nag''' S, ASTRO 2005 #2086)
**Retrospective. 64 patients (54 mets CRC, 2 mets non-CRC, 4 CCA) treated with permanent BT 160 Gy; R1 59%, R2 41%; median follow-up 13.2 years
**Median survival (5-year OS): 20 months (5%). Higher for small implants and without prior resection
**Local control (5-year): median 9 months (22%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Permanent I-125 brachytherapy is a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for unresectable intrahepatic malignancies. It is a simple technique with morbidity and mortality rates comparable to liver resection alone. Patients considered good candidates for I-125 brachytherapy include those with small volume implants, those without prior liver resection, and those with solitary liver metastases.

**Protocol report. 11 patients treated with bilateral percutaneous drainage + BT + EBRT; 6 patients completed protocol.
**Mean survival: 10.5 months, better tahn control group with stenting (2.7 months) or drainage (1.7 months)

*'''Hong Kong''' PMID 15918211 -- ''Long-term survival after intraluminal brachytherapy for inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a case report.'' ('''2005 Chan''' SY, World J Gastroenterol. 2005 May 28;11(20):3161-4.)
**Case report. 1 patient. Unresectable hilar CCA survival &gt;6 years

*'''Berlin Germany''' PMID 15525748 -- ''Liver malignancies: CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy in patients with unfavorable lesions for thermal ablation.'' ('''2004 Ricke''' J, J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2004 Nov;15(11):1279-86.)
**Phase II. 20 patients (19 liver mets, 1 cholangiocarcinoma) treated with CT-guided HDR. Group A (n=11, liver tumors &gt;5cm), Group B (n=9, liver tumors &lt;5cm adjacent to hilum). Average dose 17 Gy (12-25 Gy). Median follow-up 13 months
**Severe side effects 2 patients (10%): obstructive jaundice from tumor edema, intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Frequent LFT elevation without clinical symptoms
**1-year local tumor control: Group A 40%, Group B 71%. After CT-guided HDR retreatment 93% overall control
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;CT-guided brachytherapy based on individual dose plans and 3D CT data sets generated encouraging results in large liver malignancies as well as in tumors located adjacent to the liver hilum.&quot;

*'''Asahikawa Japan 1988-98''' PMID 14630274 -- ''Intraluminal low-dose-rate 192Ir brachytherapy combined with external beam radiotherapy and biliary stenting for unresectable extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''2003 Takamura''' A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Dec 1;57(5):1357-65.)
**Retrospective. 93 patients treated with definitive RT. EBRT (50 Gy) + ILRT (mean 39.2 Gy at 0.5 cm)
**Median survival: 12 months; impact of tumor length, hepatic invasion, DM
**Mild-to-severe GI complications in 34%, related to length of ILRT and activity
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our combined-modality therapy provided reasonable local control and improved the quality of life of patients with extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma. Because none of the treatment characteristics had any impact on survival or biliary patency, lower dose levels and/or a localized target volume are recommended to minimize morbidity.

**Retrospective. 31 patients with EBRT (median 50.4 Gy), 17 EBRT alone vs. 14 EBRT + ILRT (15 Gy at 1.5cm). 
**Locoregional failure most common, no difference in recurrence rates (53% vs. 36%, p=NS)
**With EBRT dose &gt;50 Gy, most experienced GI symptoms
**Overall 2-year survival: 0% EBRT vs 21% EBRT + ILRT (p=0.02)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Given these observations, we believe that the combined use of EBRT and high-dose-rate ILBT is a beneficial, relatively safe, and effective method of improving the treatment outcome in selected patients with inoperable carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts.&quot;
 
*'''Graz Austria''' PMID 12558559 -- ''Palliative treatment of unresectable bile duct tumours.'' ('''2003 Mayer''' R, Acta Med Austriaca. 2003;30(1):10-2.)
**Retrospective. 14 patients treated with HDR BT (10 Gy), 5 patients additional EBRT (45-50.4 Gy)
**Median survival: 6.5 months, BT alone 4.5 months vs. BT+EBRT 6.5 month (p=NS)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Patients with advanced unresectable bile duct cancer face a dismal prognosis; however, biliary drainage, and intraluminal brachytherapy with or without external RT, seem to be able to improve quality of life in the remaining time span.&quot;

*'''Aachen Germany''' PMID 12491056 -- ''Combined external beam and intraluminal radiotherapy for irresectable Klatskin tumors.'' ('''2002 Schleicher''' UM, Strahlenther Onkol. 2002 Dec;178(12):682-7.)
**Retrospective. 30 patients with proximal tumors. 18 treated with EBRT (median 30 Gy) vs. 12 treated with EBRT (median 30 Gy) + ILRT (median 40 Gy). 24 patients received low dose 5-FU
**Median survival: EBRT only 3.9 months vs. EBRT/ILRT 9.1 months
**Significant (p&lt;0.05) improvement in ILRT &gt;30 Gy and patients without jaundice
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The poor prognosis in patients with advanced Klatskin's tumors may be improved by combination therapy, with the role of brachytherapy and chemotherapy still to be defined. Our results suggest that patients without jaundice should be offered brachytherapy, and that a full dose of more than 30 Gy should be applied.&quot;

***Retrospective. 13 patients with BD and GB treated with HDR BT via diahepatal drain or PTBD
***Control of jaundice in all patients. Well tolerated. Mean survival 9.2 months
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The addition of intraluminal brachytherapy may be beneficial to patients with carcinomas causing biliary obstruction in whom bile drainage can be established.&quot;

**PMID 12143198 -- ''Transduodenal intraluminal high dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of carcinomas of the subhepatic region.'' ('''2002 Dvorak''' J, Hepatogastroenterology. 2002 Jul-Aug;49(46):1045-7.
***Retrospective. 12 patients with inoperable BD and pancreatic head
***Mean survival 9.4 months 
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Transduodenal intraluminal brachytherapy is technically feasible. The addition of intraluminal brachytherapy may be beneficial to patients in whom drainage can be established. Transduodenal insertion of brachytherapy is not competitive to the percutaneous approach but spreads the possibilities of the treatment of bile duct carcinoma. Intraluminal brachytherapy of pancreatic head carcinoma is feasible only via transduodenal approach.&quot;

**Phase I/II. 18 patients treated with 45 Gy EBRT + HDR BT (52 Gy vs. 59 Gy vs. 66 Gy) 
**Median survival 12.2 months
**Dose response suggested: 9 months vs. 12.2 months vs. 20.3 months survival (p=NS), 25% CR/PR vs. 80% CR/PR responses
**&lt;u&gt;Conlusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;High dose rate brachytherapy of 21 Gy in three divided weekly treatments, plus 45 Gy of external beam radiation is well tolerated. A dose response is shown with significant increase of PR and CR rate for dose &gt;59 Gy. This modality of treatment appears to be safe and effective for inoperable extrahepatic biliary duct carcinoma.&quot;

*'''Prague Czech Rep''' PMID 11462891 -- ''Intraluminal brachytherapy and selfexpandable stents in nonresectable biliary malignancies--the question of long-term palliation.'' ('''2001 Bruha''' R, Hepatogastroenterology. 2001 May-Jun;48(39):631-7.)
**Retrospective. 32 patients with nonresectable CA (17 Klatskin, 11 GB, 4 papula) treated with stent implant and ILRT (30Gy)
**Median survival: Klatskin 11.9 months, GB 7.0 months, papulla 42.5 months. No stent complications
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Intraluminal brachytherapy combined with stent implantation is a safe method and appears to prolong survival in inoperable patients with Klatskin's tumor and carcinoma of papilla Vateri compared with nontreated patients in previous studies. In contrast no similar effect should be expected in patients with gallbladder carcinoma.&quot;

*'''Asahikawa Japan 1988-99''' PMID 10884992 -- ''[Management of hilar bile duct carcinoma with high-dose radiotherapy and expandable metallic stent placement] - [Article in Japanese]'' ('''2000 Saito''', Nippon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 2000 May;101(5):423-8.)
**Retrospective. 107 patients treated with metallic stent and EBRT + HDR BT (59-98 Gy)
**2-year (5-year) OS: RT 23% (8%) vs. no RT 0% (0%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;High-dose radiotherapy, consisting of ILRT and EBRT, appears to be feasible in the management of hilar bile duct carcinoma, and it offers a survival advantage for patients not suited for surgical resection. The placement of EMS assists the internal bile flow and lengthens survival after high-dose radiotherapy.&quot;

*'''Amsterdam 1985-97''' PMID 10436826 -- ''Role of radiotherapy, in particular intraluminal brachytherapy, in the treatment of proximal bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''1999 Gonzalez Gonzalez''' D, Ann Oncol. 1999;10 Suppl 4:215-20.)
**Retrospective. 109 patients received RT, 71 patients surgery + preop RT (19) or + post-op RT (52). Of these, 41 received 10 Gy ILRT boost. Median dose 50-55 Gy. 38 patients palliative RT, 19 received 22-25 ILRT Gy boost. Median dose 60-68 Gy.
**Median survival: surgery + RT 24 months vs. palliative 10.4 months
**Surgical patients: dose &gt; 55 Gy had *lower* survival, and no benefit to brachytherapy
**Palliative patients: no benefit to brachytherapy
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The role of radiotherapy either as adjuvant or as primary treatment remains to be demonstrated in prospective randomised studies. From our results, it seems that high radiation doses could be dangerous and could detriment prognosis. Brachytherapy boost was not superior to treatment with external beam irradiation alone.&quot;

*'''Turin Italy 1980-96''' PMID 9824998 -- ''Interventional radiology and radiotherapy for inoperable cholangiocarcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts.'' ('''1998 Milella''' M, Tumori 1998; 84:467-71.)
**Retrospective. 130 patients treated with palliative percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), 19 excluded after short PTBD survival (&lt;30 days), 111 analyzed. No RT 80% vs. EBRT 9% vs. EBRT + ILRT 11%
**Median OS: 4.2 months; no RT 3.6 months vs. EBRT 11.5 months vs. EBRT + ILRT 14.3 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The combination of ERT plus BRT improves survival and quality of life of the patients submitted to PTBD for cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''Osaka Japan''' PMID 9638416 -- ''Endoscopic irradiation and parallel arrangement of Wallstents for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.'' ('''1998 Kubota''' Y, Hepatogastroenterology. 1998 Mar-Apr;45(20):415-9.)
**Case report. HDR BT followed by placement of 2 Wallstents in parallel
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;This endoscopic technique seems to be simple, safe, and reliable in obtaining bilateral hepatic drainage with Wallstents in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.&quot;

*'''Mayo Jacksonville''' PMID 9369143 -- ''External radiation therapy and transcatheter iridium in the treatment of extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.'' ('''1997 Foo''' ML, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Nov 1;39(4):929-35.)
**Retrospective. 24 patients, median EBRT dose 50.4 Gy, median transcatheter boost at 1 cm radius was 20 Gy. 9 pts received concomitant 5-FU
**Median survival 12.8 months, 5-year OS 14.1%
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;External beam irradiation combined with a transcatheter boost can result in long-term survival of patients with EHBD cancer. Both distant metastases and local recurrence develop in 25-30% of patients despite irradiation. Survival may be improved by using chemotherapy in combination with EBRT to impact disease relapse (local and distant). Because there may be a dose response with irradiation, survival may also be improved by increasing the dose of radiation delivered by transcatheter boost.&quot;

*'''Minnesota''' PMID 9274796 -- ''Biliary tree malignancies: the University of Minnesota experience.'' ('''1997 Lee''' CK, J Surg Oncol. 1997 Aug;65(4):298-305.)

**Median survival 8 months, 3 long term survivors

*'''Adelaide Australia 1983-93''' PMID 9153812 -- ''Intraluminal brachytherapy in the treatment of bile duct carcinomas.'' ('''1997 Leung''' JT, Australas Radiol. 1997 May;41(2):151-4.)
**Retrospective. 15 patients transhepatic BT; 11 LDR, 4 HDR
**Median survival: 12.5 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that the addition of intraluminal brachytherapy after biliary drainage prolongs survival and is a safe and effective treatment, but patients still have a high rate of local failure, and further studies will be needed to address this problem.&quot;

*'''Sydney Australia 1989-94''' PMID 8602818 -- ''Intraluminal brachytherapy in bile duct carcinomas.'' ('''1996 Leung''' J, Aust N Z J Surg. 1996 Feb;66(2):74-7.)
**Retrospective. 16 patients transhepatic BT, 1 +EBRT
**Median survival: 23 months
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We conclude that iridium-192 brachytherapy is a safe effective treatment for biliary tract carcinoma but a comparison between surgery and stenting would be of value. However, the cost of brachytherapy is not cheap and its value in this regard should be carefully analysed.&quot;

*'''Hokkaido Japan 1983-91''' PMID 8598352 -- ''The role of radiotherapy in the management of extrahepatic bile duct cancer: an analysis of 145 consecutive patients treated with intraluminal and/or external beam radiotherapy.'' ('''1996 Kamada''' T, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1996; 34:767-74.)
**Retrospective. 145 patients, 6 pre-op RT, 59 post-op RT, 54 radical RT, 23 palliative RT. 
**RT: ILRT mean dose 42.2 Gy (20-95 Gy @ 0.4 Gy/hr), EBRT mean dose 42.2 Gy (7.5-80 Gy). Total mean dose 67.8 Gy
**Mean survival (5-year survival): Preop RT 8.4 mo (11%) vs. postop RT 21.5 mo (18%) vs. radical RT 12.4 mo (6%) vs. palliative RT 4.3 mo (0%) 
**Post-op RT MST: Stage I/II 32.0 months vs. Stage III/IV 18.6 months (p&lt;0.05)
**Post-op RT: mean survival EBRT 14.4 mo vs. ILRT 24.7 mo (p=0.05)
**Adjuvant RT: EBRT vs. ILRT (p=NS)
**No dose response, but trend in post-op RT group (MST 17 mo vs. 26 mo)
**Total dose &gt; 90 Gy showed higher incidence of hemorrhagic gastroduodenal ulceration
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;High-dose radiotherapy, consisting of ILRT and EBRT, appears to be feasible in the management of EHBD cancer, and it offers a survival advantage for patients not suited for surgical resection [compared with historical controls] and patients with positive margins in the resected end of the hepatic side bile duct. Expandable metallic biliary endoprosthesis assists the internal bile flow and may lengthen survival after high dose radiotherapy.&quot;

**12 pts treated with internal drainage followed by ILRT
**Median survival: 14.5 months, all patients survived &gt;6 months

Patients can maintain a reasonable quality of life with an acceptable incidence of cholangitis, without the hindrance of external drainage devices.&quot;

**Retrospective. 30 patients (18 perihilar, 12 distal) treated with EBRT (30-45 Gy) and ILRT (20-45 Gy)
**Median survival (5-year OS): 10 months (8%)
**Palliative resection significantly better survival (12.1 months) than RT only (7.9 months)
**Brachytherapy: Max 20 Gy boost best tolerated, decrease in cholangitis (8% vs. 23%)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;The present standard treatment schedule 40 Gy for the external beam and 20 Gy (fourfold 5 Gy) for the afterloading boost seems to be appropriate and well tolerated. After radiotherapy, a permanent supply of drainage should be made with a stent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An operating system: programming code specifically used as a base to provide basic functionality to electronic devices.

''Useless since you'll have to define &quot;basic functionality&quot; then and some idiot will claim that the kernel is the only operating system even though kernels have nothing to do with operating systems. And completely false since VM microcode will be the &quot;operating system&quot; of some embedded devices. Better luck next time.''

''And what exactly is your problem with the proposed definition anyways? The definition works best on well-designed operating systems like Smalltalk. The entirety of the Smalltalk system is the operating system and if anyone claimed that only a tiny subset of it (the part needed to get &quot;basic functionality&quot;) were the OS, they would be dismissed.''

''Bringing the word &quot;programming&quot; into it was a good idea but you missed the mark completely. The operating system is the entirety of the (coherent) system that is ''programmatic'' in nature and so serves as a base for further programming. It has nothing to do with &quot;functionality&quot; nor with &quot;basic&quot; vs &quot;advanced&quot;.''
==============

November 11, 2005

“Define &quot;basic functionality””. Since the &lt;strike&gt;hardware&lt;/strike&gt; software needed to make a device useful varies from electronic device to electronic device; I would have to define basic functionality as the bare minimum needed to allow whatever hardware one device contains to function and be useful. The whole point of basic functionality would be that the Operating System would need to contain all that it is need for it to serve purpose it is designed for. Your point about the kernel or a fraction of any operating system is pointless as the most basic function of the operating system is to be useful for the propose it was designed for; the kernel or a fraction of any operating system by themselves will not allow electronic devices to function at a level that would be considered useful.

LOL 

I do understand that a computer with nothing more than an operating system installed is to some degree useless. However, a computer in such a state that is up and running would be ready for additional software to be installed, thus allowing the computer and the operating system to go from a state of basic functionality  to full or advanced functionality; depending on the total propose of the computer.

''My point about kernels is this. First of all they are kernels and not operating systems so calling them operating systems violates standard use of language. If a definition allows kernels to be considered operating systems then the definition is simply wrong.''

''Second, you can strip an operating system even lower than the kernel by stripping the kernel of functionality and still call it an operating system. But you can't do this ''logically'', you can only do it ''physically''. If you have an operating system on device A which is simply the kernel of the operating system on device B then both are operating systems. But if you talk about a fraction of the operating system on device B then that is NOT the operating system. The operating system is the entirety of the coherent system. And since Unix software *routinely* makes use of shell scripts, then all of these standard utilities that exist in a Unix system are part of Unix.''

''Note the point about the X Window system is thin. X Window is, I think, used programmatically by window managers. But of course, window managers are never used programmatically by end users. And in either case, none of them are programmed in a way remotely similar to everything else in Unix.''

.........

''And what exactly is your problem with the proposed definition anyways?”

I felt it was incomplete and lacking something. Wasn’t sure what it was so I added my 2 cents. Seems like the definition has changed… I like the new one as it makes it easier for someone that is not a programmer to understand. Furthermore, the whole point of defining something is to help people understand what is being defined. The previous definition really didn’t seem to state what an operating system is in plain English. For the most part it seemed to be a politician’s/lawyer’s answer to a question that he/she was unsure of and was explained in the most complex and broadest way possible in an attempt to make those that didn’t understand turn away and not say anything (As opposed to saying something and sounding stupid.) while still saying enough to allow someone that understands to agree that it is correct.  

One more point, it is my understanding that the whole point to propose a definition is to generate feedback; unless this was suppose to be one of those rhetorical proposals?

''Ideally, and always with me, the whole point of a definition is to get it right. Useful feedback generally takes the form of &quot;the definition applies to X which we all agree is not one of those things we want included&quot; or &quot;the definition doesn't apply to Y even though we all agree it's one of those things we want included&quot;. In your case, it would have been &quot;using the definition, I can't even tell whether or not X and Y are included or excluded&quot;. Note that this is the form my feedback to your proposal took.''

''Now granted, I knew the definition I gave was deficient but the inspiration that fixed it was a stroke of dumb luck. Programmatic vs interactive use has been a sometimes recurring theme in my mind for years. I think it would have been more reasonable to attack the coherence criterion and demand that some kind of criterion be drawn up to draw the boundary between what's part of the OS and what isn't.''

-------
====================

You can call it dumb luck; I call it inspiring people to be their best. (If you can’t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with BS, right?) 

lol... I will admit I’m not always right, but when I give my 2 cents it tends to inspire people. I wasn't trying to redefine it; I was merely stating what I believed an OS to be. As stated on the main page &quot;the software that comes on an operating system install CD” is not even close to what an OS is. I’m not educated, but I know enough to know that what is included on of those disks normally exceeds what an OS truly is. In the case of WinXP, screen savers, spider solitary, so on and so forth are not part of the OS. Basic functionality was a way to eliminate such items from what I believed the to be OS. Basically I think we were trying to answer or define two aspects of what an OS is. 

I was thinking about the commodity aspect, what is bought and sold. Well basicly. Apparently you are defining what is deeper within the OS as in what an operating system does.  So as far as my comments being X or Y, the answer is 42. ;-) This brings your point about the kernel or a fraction of any operating system into perspective. While there are components of an operating system that in many ways mimic the behavior and fit general concept OS, the components are not operating systems because they require the system as a whole to do thier function. I don’t know if I explained it correctly but I think I understand what you are trying to define. To be honest it sounds like you are defining what an OS does and/or what can be considered an OS based on what it dose and how it does it. 

So one might confuse a kernel with an OS because the kernel is A set of principles and concepts and all of the components which obey these principles designed to provide system stability.(to make a long story short)  However, because the kernel is dependant on all the other processes of the OS as a whole to be able to function, it can not be defined as an OS. There is a great deal of difference in what we were trying to define. 

So you are defining what an OS can and can not be based on what it does, at the same time you are defining various components of an OS that have the same general concept of the OS, that can not be defined as an OS because they require the OS as a whole to function, and without the OS as a whole they have no function.

''I forgive a lot from people who are genuinely trying to help. As opposed to people who are simply trying my patience *cough* AlbertCahalan *cough* *cough*. If you see any other weaknesses, please bring them up and be as brutally forthright as you can. Just so long as you put in a genuine effort to understand.''

''Next up is defining systems design, partly so I can exclude certain people who are trying my patience, but mostly because most people (and even more so for programmers) really don't know what it is.'' [[User:24.200.176.92|24.200.176.92]] 02:55, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

==============
am I any closer to the subject this time?

''Heh, missed this first time through. Okay, your understanding of what OSes are seems very close but not quite on target. For certain kinds of users, very humdrum engineering types, an OS is something much reduced from what it is to most people. For them, an OS may be a kernel, a shell, a couple of utilities, a filesystem, various drivers, and that's pretty much it. And that would be the OS they use to develop on, as opposed to the OS they are targeting. The OS they are targeting could be even more stripped of function. It could have no utilities, fewer drivers, a rudimentary shell at best, a rudimentary filesystem, maybe even a stripped down kernel. This is the world of embedded systems.''
----------------------

I assure you I’m not here solely to annoy you. I’m not sure how much more I can help you; however I do have a genuine interest in this subject. I have decided to do a little more research on the subject before add anything else so it might be a week or two before I get back with questions/comments.

To flesh this book out a bit, I rewrote information from Tanenbaum's Operating Systems design and Implementation sec ed. (1997) for a more comprehensive historical view of what an operating system is and has been.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:49, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

Repaired what I am pretty sure was annonymous vandalism where Babbages name was replaced with Ajay
Babbage is a historical figure, and Ajay, is probably someones first name.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 13:50, 22 July 2009 (UTC)


-------------------------

People who have had no technical introduction to Operating System design seem to fall victim to the Microsoft Marketing Mythos. 

They seem to obtain some peculiar attitude towards the word &quot;kernel&quot;. I suggest you all grab 4 or 5 good academic texts on operating system design and read the definition each one gives for what an operating system is.

Across the board, You'll find some very similar characteristics.  And you'll find that in nearly every case, the word kernel and Operating system will have a 98% concordance.  Not identical, but always nearly identical.   [[Special:Contributions/24.91.86.136|24.91.86.136]] ([[User talk:24.91.86.136|discuss]]) 17:55, 26 January 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You need at least the Demo version of Trados.
Here is the solution for Word and RTF files and files processed with S-Tagger (rtf files with a lot of tags).

If you get unsegmented files from your customer (segmented files contain every sentence twice - the source sentence is marked hidden and between the source and the target sentences you have things like &lt;}0{&gt; with varying numbers):

Open Trados WB with the TM from your customer (if you have a proper Trados version) or create a new empty TM in your language pair (if you have the Demo), go '''Tools''', '''Translate''', select the option '''segment unknown sentences''', select the files you need to translate and click on '''Translate'''.  The result is untranslated, segmented, uncleaned Trados files.

For each file you have now 2 files, one with the original extension (e.g. rtf) and one with the extension BAK, which is a backup of your original.

Close Trados WB. 

Create a project in DVX. Select the files you want to import – the ones with the original extension. In the import window of the Wizard highlight all of them and click on the button '''Properties'''. Click in the field '''Filter''' that shows ''Microsoft Word'' or ''Rich text'' format (depending on your files). Select ''Trados Workbench''. Now import your files and translate them.

Be careful to check for code errors (CTRL+Shift+F8) before exporting.

After the export, you have uncleaned, translated Trados files.

If you need to clean them, open Trados WB, '''Tools''', '''Cleanup''', '''select do not update TM''' and select your translated files, click '''Cleanup'''.
No you have cleaned files (files with the extension you first had) and uncleaned files with the extension BAK.

If your customer has sent you a TM and you do not have a full Trados version, you need to get the TM as a Trados.txt or TMX export. You cannot do this conversion in the Trados Demo. 
If you want to import a Trados.txt file into a DVX Database you must select Trados Workbench as import format, even if it is a txt file. If you forget this, you will get a lot of tags you do not want to have in your TM.

If you get Tag Editor files (TTX) and after importing them in to DVX you do not see any segments- the files where not segmented in Trados WB. You need to segment them just as described for the Word files. 

&lt;Addition below by Rob Laumen&gt;

After importing the TTX file, you need to use the Rows Selector to switch from All Rows to Unpainted Rows. Then right-click on the translation grid and select Clear All Translations (not to worry: this actually means Clear All Translations *In This View*). Now switch back to All Rows using the Rows Selector. Now that all rows with no matches are empty, Auto-Assemble will work on CTRL/ALT+down (if enabled). On non-empty unpainted rows you would have to press CTRL+A to assemble those segments.

== images ==

Thanks for your help, but I don't think we need massive tagging of images with no license. It's a job for a bot.

Some of these images are old and people often weren't aware that they should tag files with copyright tags (in fact, these tags were not complete). You can write to images authors to fix them. F.e. Jer54 is an active user and he tagged some of his images when I reminded him. You can use {{tl|image copyright}} at user pages. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:17, 18 November 2005 (UTC)


I realize you mean well, but please consider using the discussion or talk pages before making dramatic cuts to our wikibook. I know you are trying to help us improve, but these edits may rub some of us the wrong way, and I want folks to welcome outside assistance. A little courtesy is all I ask. Thanks. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 01:10, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

Well, honestly I don't mind your removing the possible copyright violations. I didn't put those images there and can't account for them. We're just wondering about the title graphic, which we custom made for the project. Not sure what the problem is with it. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 02:58, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Oyvind. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Oyvind~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Treatment==

*'''MGH Pattern of Failure Study''' PMID 8093983 -- ''Patterns of Failure after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma.'' (Willet CG, Surg Gyne Obstet. 1993 Jan; 176 (1):33-8.)
**Retrospective.  41 pts with ampullary carcinoma.  69% local control, 55% OS at 5 yrs.  
**Low risk features included limited to ampulla/duodenum, well differentiated, node neg, clear margins.  Low risk w/ 100% local control and 80% OS at 5yrs.
**High risk features included invasion of pancreas,poorly differentiated,+nodes/margins.  50% local control and 38% OS at 5yrs.  Xrt appeared to benefit local control in this cohort.  Distant mets (liver, peritoneum, pleura) were dominant mode of failure in hi risk group.

*'''EORTC ''' PMID 10615932 -- ''Adjuvant radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil after curative resection of cancer of the pancreas and periampullary region: phase III trial of the EORTC gastrointestinal tract cancer cooperative group.'' (Klinkenbijl JH, Annals of Surgery.  1999 Dec; 230(6):776-82.)
**Randomized prospective.  Included both pancreatic head and peri-ampullary tumors.  T1-T3, N0-N1a peri-ampullary allowed. 218 pts total.  45% had peri-ampullary.  Randomized to 5FU/xrt vs observation. On subgroup analysis, 2yr OS for peri-ampullary CA was 63% (obs) vs 67% (chemoxrt) p=0.737.  No reduction in locoregional recurrence rate was seen in this group.
*'''Stanford 1995-99''' PMID 11146780 -- ''Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for &quot;unfavorable&quot; carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater: preliminary report.'' ('''2001 Mehta''' VK, Arch Surg. 2001 Jan;136(1):65-9.)
**Prospective. 12 patients with &quot;unfavorable&quot; features (+LN, positive margins, poorly differentiated, &gt;2 cm, neurovascular invasion). After surgery, RT 45 Gy + continuous infusion 5-FU. **2-yr OS 89%, MS 34 months, 8/12 disease-free at 2 years.
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is well tolerated and might improve control of this disease in patients with unfavorable features.&quot;

== power supply ==

What is the point of the &quot;Power Supply&quot; section?
* I wouldn't build the supply described there if I were buying a PIC programmer, since it would already come with the appropriate power supply built in.
* I wouldn't build the supply described there if I were building my own PIC programmer. Each one of the over a dozen complete [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/devprogs.htm &quot;build your own PIC programmer&quot; projects] has complete instructions for building its own power supply. Most of those power supplies are very different and incompatible with the one currently described in the &quot;power supply&quot; section.

== UV-erasable and OTP PICmicros ==

As far as I can tell, *all* of the UV-erasable and OTP PICmicros (PIC12C, PIC16C, PIC17C, PIC18C) are no longer recommended for new designs.
I fail to see the point of long discussions of the details of some obsolete chip before getting to the &quot;good stuff&quot; describing some chip that might actually be useful.

I'm going to strikethrough (&lt;s&gt;strikethrough&lt;/s&gt;) all mention of such chips for now.
Should I simply delete all all mentions of such chips, or is there something about these chips important enough to mention in the &quot;history&quot; section?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:26, 26 August 2009 (UTC)


I've unstriked some of the sections I considered useful. I agree that instead of teaching people with almost obsolete chips we should show them the brand-new chips beeing produced. Remember: the 16F84 remained in the hobbyist community for a while because no one wanted to start with something new to the area! Let's change that!

* JSON (perhaps encapsulated in packets of one of the above formats) seems to be gaining popularity as a way to transmit complex data structures, in a way that is easy for humans to read and debug.[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4000678/using-python-to-generate-a-c-string-literal-of-json] [[w:JSON]]

Typically an embedded system has one &quot;main&quot; CPU and a bunch of peripheral devices.
Is there a way for the main CPU to automatically find out how many peripheral devices are currently connected, and the unique ID of each device?
Yes, several ways -- some of them are listed on

==Glioma==
*15.Jul.06 - Toxicity is acceptable at the current doses of erlotinib plus RT
*15.Nov.05 - Cognitive function was stable after RT in supratentorial low-grade gliomas evaluated prospectively during 3 years of follow-up.


==Trigeminal Neuralgia==
*15.Jul.06 - The use of plugs to protect the brainstem during GKR treatment for TN increases the dose of irradiation delivered to the intracisternal trigeminal nerve root and is associated with an important increase in the incidence of trigeminal nerve dysfunction.

==Orbit==
*15.Jul.06 - Brachytherapy using 106Ru plaques is a highly efficient therapy with excellent local tumor control and an acceptable incidence of side effects.
*15.Nov.05 - Fractionated proton radiotherapy is superior to 3D conformal photon radiation in the treatment of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma.

==H&amp;N==
*15.Jul.06 - Paraganglioma. External-beam RT and SRS are safe and effective for enlarging and/or symptomatic paragangliomas.
*15.Jul.06 - Conventional head-and-neck radiotherapy is associated with substantial functional deficits and diminished HR-QOL. 
*15.Jul.06 - Patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer tended to have a good prognosis after radical RT. However, second malignancies had an adverse effect on the overall outcomes of patients with early hypopharyngeal cancer.
*15.Jul.06 - PI/II. Concurrent docetaxel/concomitant boost radiation and surgery after induction chemotherapy in poor prognosis patients yields good local regional control and survival. 
*15.Jul.06 - Prevertebral muscle involvement is an independent prognostic factor for NPC recurrence.
*15.Jul.06 - Use of FDG-PET was found to influence the salvage treatment decision making for locally persistent NPC by identifying patients who were not likely to benefit from additional treatment and by improving accuracy of GTV definition in salvage treatment planning.
*15.Nov.05 - PIII. Amifostine administration during head-and-neck RT reduces the severity and duration of xerostomia 2 years after treatment and does not seem to compromise locoregional control rates, progression-free survival, or overall survival.
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. For patients who have no evidence of residual lymphadenopathy and a negative FDG PET scan 12 weeks after definitive radiation, neck dissection can be safely withheld. Even in cases in which small residual lymphadenopathy was observed, regional recurrences have not occurred when the post-RT PET scan was negative and neck dissection was withheld. For patients with large residual lymphadenopathy (greater than 2.0–3.0 cm in size) but a negative post-RT FDG PET, further studies with longer follow-up are necessary to determine the appropriateness of withholding neck dissection.
*15.Nov.05 - Regarding target volumes, acceptable plans can be generated with either WF-IMRT or HB-IMRT. WF-IMRT has an advantage if uncertainty at the match line is a concern, whereas HB-IMRT, particularly in cases not involving the base of tongue, can achieve much lower doses to the larynx.
*15.Nov.05 - Stimulated flow measurements using Lashley cups, with a complication defined as flow ≤25% of the preradiotherapy output, correlated best with the mean parotid gland dose. When reduction of the mean dose to the parotid gland is intended, the stimulated flow measurement is the best method for evaluating parotid gland function.
*15.Nov.05 - Radiation appears to cause carotid artery stenosis. There may be a dose threshold for carotid wall changes, which has relevance for radiotherapy in several tumor sites.

==NSCLC==
*15.Jul.06 - This retrospective analysis identified KPS and weight loss as the most important prognostic factors of outcome in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with hyperfractionation (1.2 Gy BID to 69.6 Gy) radiation therapy.
*15.Jul.06 - PI. RT dose escalation of weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel. The MTD was 74 Gy.
*15.Jul.06 - Patterns of failure after resection of non–small-cell lung cancer. Most common was bronchial stump/staple line
*15.Jul.06 - Proton treatment appears to reduce dose to normal tissues significantly, even with dose escalation (up to 87.5 Gy), compared with standard-dose photon therapy, either 3D-CRT or IMRT.
*15.Jul.06 - Dose escalation 69-103 Gy. With long-term follow-up for toxicity, we have demonstrated that much higher doses of radiation than are traditionally administered can be safely delivered to a majority of patients with NSCLC.
*15.Nov.05 - PI. Stereotactis BS. MTD T1 &gt;60 Gy, MTD T2 72 Gy for tumors &gt;5cm
*15.Nov.05 - PET/CT radiation treatment planning is a useful tool resulting in modification of GTV in 52% and improvement of interobserver variability up to 84%.
*15.Nov.05 - With the advent of in-room soft-tissue imaging techniques such as megavoltage CT imaging with a helical tomotherapy unit, daily documentation of the status of a grossly visible targeted tumor becomes possible. The current study demonstrated that tumor regression can be documented for patients with non–small-cell lung cancer treated with helical tomotherapy.
*15.Nov.05 - The response by conventional response criteria (CR/PR) correlated strongly with improved overall survival and progression-free survival and an increasing percentage of decrease in tumor size resulted in a reduction in the risk of death.
*15.Nov.05 - PII. Induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and vinorelbine followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy 63 Gy with etoposide and cisplatin showed very promising survival in patients with Stage III NSCLC, especially in those without supraclavicular nodal involvement

==Mesothelioma==
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. Pleurectomy/decortication with adjuvant radiotherapy is not an effective treatment option for patients with MPM. Our results imply that residual disease cannot be eradicated with external RT with or without brachytherapy and that a more extensive surgery followed by external RT might be required to improve local control and overall survival.


==Breast==
*15.Jul.06 - Sequential high doses of epirubicin, preceded by dexrazoxane, and paclitaxel did not adversely affect the tolerability of locoregional RT in breast cancer patients.
*15.Jul.06 - During external breast irradiation, many patients will have significant (&gt;20%) volume reduction in the lumpectomy cavity.
*15.Jul.06 - PIII. Hyperfractionated BID RT does not reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence in patients with locally advanced breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and mastectomy compared to QD
*15.Jul.06 - Even in this highly selected cohort, a substantial risk of local recurrence occurred after BCS alone with margins of 1.0 cm or more. These results suggest that with the possible exception of elderly women with comorbid conditions, radiation therapy after BCS remains standard treatment.
*15.Nov.05 - This ex-ante cost evaluation of internal mammary-medial supraclavicular LN chain RT showed that the upfront costs of locoregional RT are easily compensated for by avoiding the costs of treating locoregional and distant relapse at a later stage.
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. Stage I/II treated with BCT +/- systemic chemo. LVI was the strongest independent prognostic factor for OS, DFS, and local recurrence, irrespective of nodal status and systemic adjuvant treatment. Although LVI may not be a contraindication for BCT, as has been proposed by certain groups, it is necessary to define its role in prospective studies in determining local and systemic treatment.

==Esophagus==
*15.Jul.06 - PI/II. Our findings failed to demonstrate an improvement in pCR or survival with PFT-R (5FU/paclitaxel/RT) vs. PF-R (5FU/cisplatin) in locally advanced esophageal CA. 
*15.Nov.05 - Pathologic response of an initially highly metabolic tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy could be correlated with the metabolic response, and FDG-PET can provide additional information on tumor response to chemoradiotherapy.

==Liver==
*15.Nov.05 - Lymph node metastasis from HCC is sensitive to EBRT. EBRT with 25 fractions of 2 Gy is an effective palliative treatment for patients with LN metastases from HCC presenting with good performance status and may prolong overall survival.


==Pancreas==
*15.Nov.05 - IORT is well tolerated and does not increase the morbidity or mortality of potentially curative surgical resection for pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma.


==Rectum==
*15.Jul.06 - We propose to include the primary tumor, the mesorectal subsite, and the posterior pelvic subsite in the CTV in all patients. Moreover, the lateral lymph nodes are at high risk for microscopic involvement and should also be added in the CTV.


==Prostate==
*15.Jul.06 - With reliable dose data available in the operating room, our results question the need for routine postimplant dose studies. 
*15.Jul.06 - Intrarectal amifostine. This trial suggests greater rectal radioprotection from acute effects with 2 g vs. 1 g amifostine suspension. 
*15.Jul.06 - For prostate cancer with ECE, the median linear distance of ECE was 2.4 mm and occurred primarily posterolaterally (along neurovascular bundle). Although only 5% of patients demonstrate ECE &gt;4 to 5 mm beyond the capsule, this risk may exceed 20% in patients with PSA ≥10 ng/ml and biopsy Gleason score ≥7.
*15.Jul.06 - Anemia is a common side effect of NAST and is usually mild. Hb levels, however, do not predict biochemical control or survival.
*15.Jul.06 - Neoadjuvant HT and hypofractionation (52.5 Gy in 20 fxs). Not good.
*15.Jul.06 - New risk groups for &gt;70Gy
*15.Jul.06 - Biochemical failure now defined as (1) a rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA be considered the standard definition for biochemical failure after EBRT with or without HT; (2) the date of failure be determined “at call” (not backdated)
*15.Nov.05 - Cone Beam CT scans are suitable for automatic online and offline position verification of the prostate, as long as the amount of nonstationary gas is limited.
*15.Nov.05 - A volume effect was found for acute GI toxicity for relative, as well as absolute, volumes. With regard to acute GU toxicity, an area effect was found, but only for absolute dose–surface histogram parameters. Neoadjuvant HT appeared to be an independent prognostic factor for acute toxicity, resulting in less acute GI toxicity, but more acute GU toxicity. The presence of pretreatment GU symptoms was the most important prognostic factor for GU symptoms during RT.
*15.Nov.05 - Retrospective. Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy with the established dose fractionation regimen yielded satisfactory bNED without local recurrence and with minimal morbidity.

==Cervix==
*15.Nov.05 - No difference was found in severe late toxicity, overall survival, or disease-free survival between the LDR and PDR groups.
*15.Nov.05 - Patterns of BT care 1996-1999
*15.Nov.05 - Overexpression of iNOS or COX-2 or both was associated with decreased survival and a greater propensity to metastasize in cervical cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.


==Endometrium==
*15.Jul.06 - Extended-field IMRT is safe and effective with a low incidence of acute toxicity.
*15.Nov.05 - Medically inoperable Stage I endometrial carcinoma may be safely and effectively treated with HDRB as the primary therapy. In selected Stage I patients (MRI Dx, BT&gt;30Gy, our results are equivalent to that of surgery.

==Ovary==
*15.Nov.05 - In carefully selected patients with locally recurrent ovarian cancer, combined IORT and tumor reductive surgery is reasonably tolerated and may contribute to achieving local control and disease palliation.


==Pelvis==
*15.Nov.05 - CT based LNs marked
*15.Nov.05 - Conformal four-field planning with individually optimized PTVs (D) resulted in only moderate tissue complication probabilities in both kidneys with the advantage of providing significantly greater inclusion of potentially involved para-aortic LNs in comparison to accepted standard procedures (A and C).


==Hodgkin's Lymphoma==
*15.Nov.05 - EORTC 20884. In advanced-stage HL patients in complete remission after six to eight cycles of MOPP-ABV, the outcome was not influenced by violation of the radiotherapy protocol (24 Gy to all initially involved nodal areas, 16–24 Gy to all initially involved extranodal sites.)


==NHL==
*15.Jul.06 - Radiation therapy should be considered early in the course of relapsing, refractory, or localized MCL.


==Leukemia==
*15.Nov.05 - ALL. Patients who present with hematologic disease only at the time of HSCT have a low risk of CNS recurrence after TBI regardless of the use of a cranial boost, suggesting that a cranial boost may not be necessary in these patients.


==Peds==
*15.Jul.06 - RS is safe and effective in pediatric cerebral AVM with high obliteration rates.
*15.Jul.06 - A reduced dose of 36-Gy EBRT after delayed GTR may maximize local control while minimizing long-term sequelae for very young children with RMS, but unresectable tumors (e.g., parameningeal) require higher doses.
*15.Nov.05 - Radiation-induced osteosarcomas in the pediatric population

==Biology==
===H&amp;N===
*15.Nov.05 - The potential advantage of radioactive 9C-ion beam in cancer therapy has been revealed at low dose rate in comparison with a therapeutic 12C beam. This observation, however, remains to be investigated at therapeutic dose rates in the future.

===Lung===
*15.Nov.05 - A combination of radiotherapy and OGX-011 (anti-clusterin) improved control of tumor growth and vascular regression in the H460 lung cancer model.

===Rectum===
*15.Nov.05 - Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) sensitizes CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma to IR, which may be via depleting GSH and inhibiting NF-κB activity, without toxicity to bone marrow, liver, and kidney. Pretreatment with CAPE neither affected body weights nor produced hepatic, renal, or hematopoietic toxicity.

===Prostate===
*15.Nov.05 - These data indicate that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibition increases sensitivity of prostate cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation through inactivation of protein kinase B (PKB). Therefore, PTEN mutations, which lead to PKB activation, may play an important role in the resistance of prostate cancer to radiation therapy. Targeted therapy against PKB could be beneficial in the management of prostate cancer patients.
*15.Nov.05 - It may be advantageous to give adjuvant EBRT shortly (∼1 to 2 days) after commencement of clinical LDR brachytherapy, when the pO2 in the spatial regions between seeds should be elevated. If chemotherapy is given adjuvantly, it may best be administered just a little later (∼3 or 4 days) after the start of LDR brachytherapy, when perfusion should be elevated.

===Seminoma===
*15.Nov.05 - Most partial body irradiated patients (testicular seminoma) showed a significant temporal decline of translocation frequencies during a 36-month period. Thus, reciprocal translocations after partial body irradiation cannot be regarded as stable over time. The temporal decline of aberration frequencies has to be taken into account for retrospective dose estimations.


==Physics==
===Prostate===
*15.Nov.05 - Relative to skeletal anatomy, nodes covered a diffuse volume from the mid lumbar spine to the superior pubic ramus and along the sacrum and pelvic side walls. In contrast, the nodal metastases mapped much more tightly relative to the large pelvic vessels. A proposed pelvic clinical target volume to encompass the region at greatest risk of containing occult nodal metastases would include a 2.0-cm radial expansion volume around the distal common iliac and proximal external and internal iliac vessels that would encompass 94.5% of the pelvic nodes at risk as defined by our node-positive prostate cancer patient cohort.

===Cervix===
*15.Nov.05 - Compared with conventional dose prescription methods, inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA) provides a consistent method of optimization that maintains or improves target coverage while decreasing dose to normal structures. Image-guided brachytherapy and inverse planning improve brachytherapy dosimetry.</text>

Dennis G. Jerz, 01 Dec 2005.  What about putting a brief intro to Bloom's Taxonomy here? I think if a student were to ask the professor, &quot;Where on Bloom's Taxonomy would you like me to focus,&quot; that would be a great way to open up a discussion about expectations.  I think that would be more useful than the alphabetical listing, since a student who doesn't find the particular key words used by his/her instrutor will be lost in the current format. I don't want to undo the hard work that someone else put into making the list, though.  I've posted a Bloom's Taxonomy handout at this address: http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/style/taxonomy.htm

Shelly T-P, 13 Dec 2005.  Would you recommend including this link to Bloom's Taxonomy?  I am not familiar with it myself.

== assignments ==

I put what I thought were basic assignments for a beginning English course, which is who I feel the audience is for this page.  Old versions of this page had more specialized assignments which I think were more for upper level students.  I won't be offended if there are other assignments that one feels are also &quot;basic&quot; and should be added!

== Matt H's edits ==

Like with other pages, there were lots of sentences that were separated by two spaces, so I deleted the unnecessary space when appropriate.

I tried to eliminate wordiness when possible, and I deleted, or at least revised, many exclamatory sentences! In fact, I got quite the thrill from stroking the Delete key while staring in the face those exclamation marks! (Hopefully my doing so hasn't neutered the book's fun-lovin' spirit.)

Overall, the page length seems appropriate, the tone seems fairly consistent, and the prose and organization are coherent. The &quot;Finishing the Assignment&quot; section got me thinking, though, about whether we want to label sentences that begin with, for instance, &quot;Interpret,&quot; or &quot;Examine,&quot; as &quot;questions.&quot;

(For example: &quot;Knowledge: This becomes evident in how well you remember the subject matter, such as the major ideas, dates, places, events, etc. Questions may begin with: Identify, describe, examine, when, where, who.&quot;

Can a group of words that begins with &quot;Identify&quot; be considered a question? I'm probably splitting hairs but figured this issue might be worth discussing.

== Additional Guidelines ==

I feel as though this page currently constitutes a fair summary of the general process of analyzing assignments.  That being said, I believe it could use a few more &quot;basic&quot; writing assignment samples, as well as some further insight into the actual steps one would take when first looking into the task at hand (i.e. brainstorming, resolving unfamiliar/confusing wording, etc.).  Once that is finished, some basic form editing should clean it all up quite nicely.--[[User:IMFlaherty|IMFlaherty]] ([[User talk:IMFlaherty|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/IMFlaherty|contribs]]) 22:21, 1 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

|''The way to be safe is never to be secure.''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Benjamin Franklin
|}

Computing security as it applies to UNIX is usually taken to mean protection of a UNIX-based computing system against unauthorized access to information or services on that system, including viewing, copying, modifying or destroying data.

But security can also apply to unauthorized attempts to deny appropriate individuals access to the stored information through loss of availability. Security is also used to manage privacy on a system, whether by confirming the identity of a person who performed an action, and by allowing individuals to maintain control of private information.

Providing security to a system is not a goal so much as it is an ongoing process. At least at present, a UNIX computing system can never be made fully secure. However by continually applying a series of security measures to the systems, the net risk to the system can be brought to a minimum.

==Legal issues==
A necessary element of system security is the legal system. The threat of prosecution is an important element in deterring an unlawful intrusion or activity, particularly in the circumstance where the system is serving as a component of a company business or when the loss of important information can have significant consequences. It is not even necessary for a system to be compromised in order to have business consequences. A business service can be rendered inoperative for a period of time, costing a firm a significant source of income.

To allow successful prosecution of unlawful activities against a computer system, forensic evidence must be available to demonstrate that a crime occurred. This necessitates the use of logging to track activities and events on the system, and the protection of these logs against tampering. This also includes the need to make periodic backup copies of files on the system on secure media, as frequently as once per day if feasible. In the event of a direct compromise through the hardware, unmodified physical evidence may also be needed, including camera records, witnesses, and so forth.

It can be important during the prosecution to demonstrate that you were performing on-going active measures to prevent inappropriate access, rather than just initiating monitoring in the particular circumstance. So logging and auditing need to be part of the standard security measures. In addition, a carefully-worded legal warning notice needs to be presented prior to login so that the potential intruder can not claim ignorance.  Even a greeting message presented prior to login can be used as a legal defense. Finally, due diligence in securing your system can help demonstrate that an inappropriate intrusion was willful and dedicated, rather than as a result of curiosity.

===Sarbanes-Oxley===
The ''Sarbanes-Oxley Act'' of 2002 was a significant piece of legislation designed to help prevent corporate financial fraud. Although computing security was not a factor in the events that resulted in this act, the legislation has had an indirect impact on security requirements. The law imposes accounting requirements and control practices on U.S. companies, or at least those that are publically owned. Requirements for accurate financial records have been strengthened, resulting in the need for control of all aspects of how financial information is processed.

Computing security became relevant due to a provision in ''Sarbanes-Oxley'' requiring disclosure of potential liabilities that might impact the bottom line. Events that resulted in the compromise of key computing systems can have a significant impact on the company business. Three of the most relevant sections of ''Sarbanes-Oxley'' for computing security are:

* Section 302 &amp;mdash; Certification of the completeness and accuracy of financial reports by the CEO and CFO.
* Section 404 &amp;mdash; Management assessment of internal controls, which must be reported to the SEC each year.
* Section 409 &amp;mdash; Real time disclosure of information.

Due to these requirements, attention to computing security has became an important factor. The act requires companies to disclose when their financial information has been tampered with, describe the measures used to protect the data, and safeguard the information used to track the information security. Companies that are required to disclose that they have poor security practices could prove an uninviting investment, which can affect their stock value. This has brought an increased, and in some cases much-needed attention to computing security in many commercial companies.

==System management==
Applying security measures is a constant trade-off between maintaining the usefulness of a system and keeping it secure. Each new security measure will further restrict activities on a system, and is likely to be met with resistance by the users. So the system operators must weigh the risks of data loss versus less utility, and decide whether the extra measures are worth the trade-off.

The Administrator of a UNIX system has a significant ability to reduce security risks by properly configuring the operating system to enable security features. In many instances the operating system as shipped by a vendor is applied with a weak security configuration. It requires careful examination of the system to control or eliminate these weaknesses, and neglecting to apply an appropriate restriction can leave a system vulnerable to exploitation.

Once a system has been properly secured, it will still require steady maintenance and monitoring to keep it that way. New exploitations are constantly being discovered, and the administrator will need to stay on top of remedies for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Doing so may require periodic application of new patches, additional changes to the system configuration, or simply an assessment of the risk and determining a means to manage it.

==User education==
Unfortunately, individual actions by users on a UNIX system can result in a net increase in the security risk. So, in addition to monitoring potentially harmful actions by users, some education of the users is needed. This education includes raising security awareness, training users against certain types of harmful actions, and demonstrating useful tools that can enhance the security of their data.

Determining whether an individual is authorized to have access to the information is an essential component of UNIX system security, and requires access control policies, secure methods of verifying identity, and methods of storing and transmitting credentials. The identity of the individual is used to determine the information they can access, and their ability to modify information on the system.

|''Treat your password like your toothbrush. Don't let anybody else use it, and get a new one every six months.''&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Clifford Stoll
|}
In order to connect to a UNIX-based system and perform activities, a user must have an account. This account must have a unique numerical identifier, which is associated with the account name, or ''username''. The account also has a ''password'', which is string known to the user by which the account access is authenticated when accessing the system. The ''username'' and ''password'' are normally sufficient to connect a user to the system.

Users can have multiple accounts on the same system, or accounts on different systems. Each account can use a different name, if they are on the same system, or share a common name across multiple systems. Depending on the person or institution operating the systems, the individual users may be able to choose their account names, or they may be assigned a name. Typically an assigned name will be based on the person's actual name, and will be a unique identifier on the system.

==Login==
The ''username'' is also the login name, which means that it is the name that the user types on the keyboard when prompted for a login. On UNIX systems it is a requirement that the first character of the
''username'' be an alphabetical character. The case of the character matters: &quot;Joe1234&quot; is a different login name than &quot;joe1234&quot;. In most cases the account begins with a lower case character by convention. The remainder of the login name can consist of numbers, alphabetical characters, or an underscore. Thus an asterisk or colon character is invalid for a login name. Accounts with these special characters can cause problems with certain system functions, such as delivering electronic mail. So these characters are usually prohibited on many UNIX systems.

UNIX systems are typically delivered with a set of system accounts for performing special operations. These may include such accounts as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lp&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;uucp&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account has special capabilities that grant the user enhanced privileges, and so precautions are usually enforced to prevent its acquisition by unauthorized individuals. More on this later.

===/etc/passwd===
The information for UNIX accounts is stored in a text file located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains information for one account per line, and each line is subdivided into fields that are separated by colons. The meaning of the fields is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!login name
|Text name of the account
|-
!password
|The one-way hash encrypted password
|-
!user ID
|A unique numerical identifier for the account
|-
!group ID
|The default group identifier for the account
|-
!GECOS ID
|A comma-separated list of user information
|-
!home directory
|The users' initial working directory
|-
!shell
|The program to use for a shell interface
|}

When a user gains an account, they are provided with a default password so that they can login. When they connect to the system they will be prompted for the login name, followed by a prompt for the password. If the system is configured correctly, the user can then enter their provided password and it will not appear on the display when it is typed. (Some systems will print an asterisk for each password character, while others will not show anything.) If the password is valid, the user will be allowed access to the system. (They may be prompted to immediately change their password to something only they know.)

The system stores the password in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file in an encrypted form. UNIX uses an encryption technique called a one-way hash. This means that the password is encrypted using a technique that that does not have a known decryption method. That is, there is no efficient means to determine the password based on the encryption string.

Each time the user logs on, their input password is encrypted and compared to the encryption in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. If the two match then the user is allowed access. If the two do not match then access is refused and the user is prompted again to login. (Each connection allows multiple attempts in case the user accidently types the login name or password incorrectly.) Note that the password is also case sensitive, so accidently forgetting to turn off the &lt;code&gt;caps-lock&lt;/code&gt; key may result in access denial.

If there is a format error in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, the system commands are unable to read entries further down in the file. If a user is unable to log on to a system, this could be the reason why. (This is why it is important for the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account to always be the first entry, so that the System Administrator can log in and correct issues with the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.) UNIX systems can include a command called &lt;code&gt;pwck&lt;/code&gt; that can be run to check for format problems with the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. It is a good idea to run this from time to time to make sure potential problems haven't been introduced.

When editing the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;vipw&lt;/code&gt; command uses a locking mechanism to prevent another administrator from editing the same file at the same time. (Simultaneous edits can result in changes from one operator overwriting changes from another operator, an unfortunate situation where file locking is not available on multi-user systems.) It is a good habit for all System Administrators to use the &lt;code&gt;vipw&lt;/code&gt; command, assuming they are versed in the use of &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;.

===Selecting a password===
Once a user is logged on to a system, they can change their password by means of the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; command. The user will then be prompted for their current password, then they will be prompted twice for the new password selection. (The redundant prompt is to make sure that the user didn't accidently mistype the new password the first time.) After the new password is accepted, the encrypted password field will be updated in the user's account entry in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.

The password is a key element of the system's security that is used to verify a user's identity. For this reason it is vital that the password be selected so that it is difficult to guess. Simple, easily-guessable passwords have frequently been the cause of unauthorized access, and there exist programs that can attempt to gain access to a system through trial and error of commonly selected passwords.

Here are some exmples of typical passwords that can make it relatively easy to guess:

:* The person's name
:* The name of their child
:* A birthday
:* Simple words such as &quot;guess&quot; or &quot;password&quot;
:* A place name
:* The person's phone number
:* Common keyboard patterns such as &quot;qwerty&quot;
:* The name of the computer
:* A word spelled backwards
:* The same as one of the above followed by a single digit

Modern UNIX systems have security configurations that provide some measure of strength checking when a password is set or changed. For example, a password may be required to be at least eight characters in length, and include one or more upper-case and lower-case letters, a number, and a special character (such as *, $, #, %, &amp;c.) These measures can make a password much more difficult to determine. Wherever possible it is advisable to implement such features to ensure the selection of strong passwords.

When a user has an account on multiple systems, they may choose to use the same password on each of the systems in order to make it easier to remember. Unfortunately this means that if the password on one system is determined by another person, they may be able to gain unauthorized access to the other systems as well. This possibility is difficult for the System Administrator to guard against, except by educating the user and discouraging the use of passwords on multiple systems.

===Unauthorized login attempts===
Unfortunately there are individuals who may attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system by trying to use another individual's account. They may resort to surreptitious means to obtain the proper login from a user, such as observing them at the keyboard during login, using social engineering to trick an operator or user into giving them access, or by setting up a spoofing program that mimics normal login.

Another method used to obtain unauthorized access is to attempt to guess the login and password. Normally the login is printed on the screen during access, so the individual may already know the account name. However the password should be kept concealed on the screen. If a weak password has been selected by the user, however, it may still be possible to guess the password.

To make the task of guessing a password difficult, most UNIX systems have limits built into the login system. The first limit puts a time delay in between each failed login attempt, so that it takes much longer to attempt each guess. Another limit is to restrict the number of login attempts before disconnecting the session. In addition, the failed login attempts can be recorded in log files, such as &lt;code&gt;btmp&lt;/code&gt;. The log files can be periodically checked by the System Administrator to check for unusual failed login activities (such as hundreds of attempts in a day).

==Groups==
In addition to the account identifiers, UNIX can qualify access to system resources on the basis of group membership. Each group can contain multiple accounts, and an account can belong to one or more groups. An account will have a default group to which they belong, such as &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt;, and this information is stored in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file.

The &lt;code&gt;newgrp&lt;/code&gt; command is used to switch your group without changing your account. As long as the group exists and your account belongs to the group, you will be changed to the selected group name. You would now have access privileges appropriate for that group.

The group is used to manage information or resources that are shared by multiple people. It is normally used to obviate the need for shared accounts, which is considered bad security practice. Wherever possible the System Administrator should require the use of a group for providing access to shared resources, and avoid the use of a shared account. There are two reasons for this. The first is that it is nearly impossible to track or audit the activities of an individual who is a member of a shared account. The second is that it is much more difficult to terminate access by a specific individual to a shared account.

===/etc/group===
The information for UNIX groups is stored in a text file located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains information for one group per line, and each line is subdivided into fields that are separated by colons. The meaning of the fields is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!group name
|Text name of the group
|-
!password
|The one-way hash encrypted password
|-
!group ID
|The default group identifier for the account
|-
!members
|A comma-separated list of group names
|}

To belong to additional groups beyond the default, an account must be added to the appropriate members list. Here is a brief example of an &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file:

  root::0:root
  other::1:root
  bin::2:bin
  users::20:
  secrets::30:billy_bob,sally_sue,frederick

Each line in the file describes a group. In this example, the accounts ''billy_bob'', ''sally_sue'', and ''frederick'' are all members of the group ''secrets'', even though their default group is ''users''. Note that if a group has a password, a user can use the password to change to that group even if he or she is not a member.

As with the &lt;code&gt;pwck&lt;/code&gt; command for the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file, there is usually a &lt;code&gt;grpck&lt;/code&gt; command available that can be used to check the format of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/group&lt;/code&gt; file. It is good practice to use this command to check that format errors have not been introduced.

==Identifiers==
UNIX uses integer values to track and store access information. The user identifier, or &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;, is an identifier that corresponds to a user's account on a UNIX system. This identifier is used internally by the system to determine ownership of potentially sensitive data and processes. When the system needs to list the owner of a data file or process, it normally maps the identifier back to the account name in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file before presenting the information.

The value of the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; can typically range from 0 up to one less than the maximum integer supported on the system. (Negative identifiers, particularly -2, are for special purpose use only.)

User identifiers are usually assigned beginning with 100, and each new account is added by assigning a previously unused identifier. When an account is deleted for some reason, the account entry is removed from the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. However this may result in files created by that account having an unassigned &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;. A new account created subsequently may be assigned the previous &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt;, making that new user the owner of the files created by the previous account. In order to prevent this eventuality, the System Administrator needs to perform periodic maintenance to locate files that lack a valid account.

===Default accounts===
During the initial installation of a system, the vendor media can load selected default accounts. These accounts are generally used for system administration and maintenance. By convention the user identifiers 0 through 99 are nearly always reserved for these accounts, such as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;daemon&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;, and so forth. In many instances, most of these accounts have their passwords disabled, and the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; is used for system files or processes.

The root account in particular, which has a uid of zero (0), is a special account that has higher privileges than any user. It is often referred to as the ''superuser'' account. Special precautions need to be taken to prevent inappropriate individuals from gaining access to this account, and much of the security-related configuration of a UNIX system is intended to prevent this eventuality.

In certain environments it may be necessary for certain administrative capabilities to be shared among more than one operator. The drawback to this, of course, is that becomes more difficult to maintain a secure system when multiple people have ''superuser'' access. It can also make it more difficult to perform a root-cause analysis when something on a system breaks.

There are several methods to help reduce the risk of a shared ''superuser'' access, although it can never be reduced to zero. The first is to configure a system so that the ''root'' account can not be accessed directly. Instead the operator must log on using their user account, then &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; (switch-user) to the ''superuser'' account. This can provide an audit trail of when the ''superuser'' account was accessed and by whom. It also helps to insulate the system from attempts to break into the ''superuser'' account directly. Instead a user account must first be compromised, and then the ''superuser'' account.

A more sophisticated approach to limiting the ''superuser'' account access requirement is through the use of ''role-based access control''. This allows designated user accounts to perform a limited set of actions that are normally restricted to the root account. (An example of this would be a trusted user account that is allowed to make revisions to a server's printer configuration.) There are a number of tools available, both in open source and from vendors, that can be used to provide role-based access control capabilities. This topic will be covered in more detail in later chapters.

==Shadow password file==
While a user's password is stored as an encrypted string on UNIX systems, anybody who can read the encrypted value may be able to use a program to test various commonly-used passwords and see if they match. That is, the program can try a series of guesses and encrypt them to see if they match the value in the user's password field. The program can also use
a dictionary of words and encrypt each one and compare them in turn to each encrypted password on a system.

To make this task somewhat more difficult for a password guessing program, the encrypted password includes a random, two-character &quot;salt&quot;. This random salt value will most likely result in a different encryption string value even when the passwords for two accounts match. As a result the program must recompute the encryption string for each guess and for every account. Nonetheless a modern UNIX system can still crunch through a large number of guesses in a relatively short amount of time, making a brute-force attack quite feasible on a system where a password consists of a simple word.

When the password is formed using a rule, such as two words separated by a number, the task becomes slightly more difficult. However a wily individual may have considerable computing resources at his or her disposal, so guessing a weak password may just be a matter of time. (An example of such a program is called &lt;code&gt;crack&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used by the System Administrator to periodically check their user's passwords for guessable values.)

In order to forestall this technique, the encrypted passwords can be stored in a separate file, commonly known as the shadow password file. The contents of the shadow password file can only be read by the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account, and the password field of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is replaced by an asterisk. The implementation of this feature will vary depending on the UNIX vendor. The shadow password is located at &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; on Sun systems and under &lt;code&gt;/tcb&lt;/code&gt; on HP-UX systems. With the encrypted password &quot;shadowed&quot; in this manner, the task of guessing a password is rendered much more difficult.

----
Most of the data used by a computer is stored on [[w:Disk storage|disk drives]]. These are physical devices with a relative high access latency, compared to, say, [[w:physical memory|physical memory]], but large storage capacity. On a server system a disk drive can be located inside the same cabinet as the  [[w:Central processing unit|CPU]], an adjacent expansion cabinet, attached to the network as an [[w:Network-attached storage|appliance]], or attached as part of a [[w:Storage area network|Storage Area Network]]. Some sites may also employ removeable disk media that can be loaded by an operator or a robotic device.

==Filesystem and files==
The [[w:File system|filesystem]] is the method by which data on a device, such as a disk drive, is laid out. It includes information that the operating system can use to find specific data content and who is allowed to access that data. All of this data is organized into a series of [[w:Computer file|files]], which are an essential means of managing information on a computer system. The data in a file is organized in a format that applications can understand. The location of a file on a directory tree is called its path.

In UNIX, as on many other modern operating systems, files are stored in a tree structure with the branch nodes being called [[w:Directory|directories]]. A directory is a special type of file that can reference zero or more other files and directories, allowing the data to be organized and access managed. Directory trees are contained in one or more filesystems.

In UNIX the filesystem contains the following information available for each file:

:* Unique inode number
:* The length of the file in bytes
:* The identifier of the device that contains the file
:* File type
:* A set of permissions bits, or ''mode''
:* Identifier of the file's owner, or ''uid''
:* Identifier of the file's group, or ''gid''
:* File creation date and time
:* File last access date and time
:* File last modification date and time
:* The total number of hard links to the inode

The typical UNIX file types are as follows:

:* Block file
:* Raw file
:* Regular file
:* Directory
:* Named pipe
:* Symbolic link
:* Socket

A hard link is a type of file that references another file on the same device and file system by means of its inode number. A symbolic link is a type of file that contains the path information to another file.

==File permissions==
Information about a file's statistics can be viewed by means of the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command in combination with the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; &quot;long listing&quot; option. Here is an example:

 $ ls -l /usr/bin/vi
 -r-xr-xr-t  6  bin  bin  604880  Sep  3 2003 /usr/bin/vi

The left-most field of the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; output displays the ''mode'' of a file. This is an integer field that is normally 2 bytes (16 bits) in length. Each bit within the ''mode'' is a binary flag that represents a type of security access setting.

The number to the right of the ''mode'' shows the total number of hard links to the file, including the original file. So this case the command has five other hard links. Next are the names of the file owner and group, followed by the file size in bytes, the date or time of the last modification, and the file name or path.

The &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; displays the ''mode'' information as a field of ten characters. The first (left-most) character shows the type of the file. The common types are as follows:

: &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Ordinary file
: &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Block special file
: &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Character special file
: &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Directory
: &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Door (Solaris)
: &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Symbolic link
: &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Network special file (HP-UX)
: &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Named pipe
: &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; Socket

The remaining nine characters consist of three groups of three characters each. Each of these groups describe a set of file permissions that determine whether a file can be read, write, and executed as a program. (They can also cover certain special execution modes. More on that in a moment.)

These permissions are indicated by an &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Thus an &lt;code&gt;rwx&lt;/code&gt; in the group set indicates that any member of the file group can read, modify, or run the file as a program (or script). The &lt;code&gt;r-x&lt;/code&gt; above is missing the write flag, so members of the group would not necessarily be able to modify the file.

From left to right, the first set of three characters indicates the permission settings for the owner of the file. The middle set are the permission settings for the file group, and the last set to the right are the permissions for every body else (usually referred to as &quot;world&quot;.)

===Set ID on execute===
The ''mode'' can also contain special flags that set the permissions of a file when it is executed. That is, if a file is a program or a script, the set permissions bits will determine the owner or group under which it will run. Normally when a job is run, it uses the user and group of the account that executes the file. This controls the type of access that the job gains.

For example, suppose a command ''myjob'' has permissions &lt;code&gt;r-xr-x---&lt;/code&gt; and is run by the file owner, user ''bill'' in group ''research''. The process that executes the ''myjob'' command is given the owner ''bill'' and group ''research''. The job can access any file that can also be accessed from the account ''bill''.

Now suppose the ''myjob'' file is given owner ''root'', and the set permissions bit for the user are activated by the System Administrator. The resulting file has permission bits &lt;code&gt;r-sr-x---&lt;/code&gt;, where the ''s'' indicates that the set user ID on execution flag has been set. Because the file still belongs to group ''research'', the user ''bill'' is able to run it. When the job is run now, however, it has access to any file that can be accessed by ''root'' (which is usually any file on the system.)

A similar effect occurs when the set group ID on execution flag has been set. The resulting file permission bits may now appear as &lt;code&gt;r-xr-s---&lt;/code&gt;. When this file is executed, the job runs as though the user belonged to the same group as the file's group identifier. That is, if the group identifier were set to &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;, when the file was executed it would have access to any file that can be accessed by the group ''sys''.

It is important to point out at this point that the set ID feature can potentially compromise the security of a system. A file that is owned by ''root'' that has the set user ID flag has the same access privileges as the System Administrator. If this file can also be modified by any user, say, then it can be exploited to elevate that user's privileges, or perform other unauthorized activities. Even if the file can not be modified by a user, it may still contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain unauthorized privileges.

For this reason the existance of files with set user ID or set group ID permissions should be carefully monitored by the System Administrator. Selected system commands require these ''mode'' settings in order to function properly. However any other files with these settings, particularly when they can be modified by a user, can represent an unacceptible level of risk to a system. Batch jobs can be run at regular intervals to search for the existence of these files and to bring them to the attention of the System Administrator.

&lt;small&gt;'''Note''': On Linux, when a shell script is executed, all setuid and setgid permissions are ignored intentionally by system.&lt;/small&gt;

===Directory permissions===
The permissions on a directory have a somewhat different meaning than they do for files. The &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;ead permissions on a directory allow the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command, with no arguments to list the contents of that directory. However the read mode only allows the file name to be read, not the file permissions, owner, or size. You also can not change directory with the &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; command to a directory where you only have read permissions, nor read the content of files in that directory.

If a directory allows you &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, or execute permissions, you can &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to that directory and read the contents of any files in that directory for which you have read privileges. You can also do a &quot;long list&quot; of the directory using the &lt;code&gt;ls&amp;nbsp;-l&lt;/code&gt; command. If a directory allows you execute but not read permissions, you get an error if you tried to use &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; to list the directory. However, if you knew that a particular file existed in that directory and if that file allowed you read privileges, you could do a &quot;long list&quot; of that file.

As a simple example:

 $ id
 uid=234(myacct) gid=100(mygrp)
 $ mkdir test
 $ touch test/test.txt
 $ chmod 100 test
 $ chmod 640 test/test.txt
 $ cd test
 $ ls
 . unreadable
 total 0
 $ ls -l test.txt
 -rw-r----- &amp;nbsp; 1 myacct mygrp &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 0 Dec 9 12:00 test.txt

See the appropriate manual pages for further information on these commands.

===Setting file permissions===
The permissions for a file can be set using the &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chgrp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; commands. The &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; is given a valid account name or numerical identifier, and is used to set the owner of a file or set of files. Likewise &lt;code&gt;chgrp&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set the group for a file. (On some operating systems, the &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; can be used to set both the owner and group of a file. Finally &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; can set the file mode.

Here is an example of a combined &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; command that sets the file owner to ''root'' and the group to ''sys'':

 $ chown root:sys /usr/local/bin/bigjob

{| style=&quot;border: solid black 1px; float: right;&quot;
!Permission
!Value
|-
|Execute (x)
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|1
|-
|Write (w)
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|2
|-
|Read (r)
|style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;|4
|}
The original format for the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command allows the entire ''mode'' to be set for a file or set of files. This is done by passing the command a three or four digit number that defines the ''mode'' settings. Each of the last three digits in the number represents one of the sets of permission flags, as discussed above. A one (1) enables the execute mode, a two (2) sets the write mode, and a four (4) sets the read mode. Any combination of these modes can be set by adding up the appropriate values.

For example:

 $ chmod 550 /usr/local/bin/bigjob

has a 5 for the user permissions, a 5 for the group permissions, and a 0 for the world permissions. A 5 is equal to a 1 plus 4, so this is enabling the read (4) and execute (1) flags for both the user and group. The world gets no privileges for this file.

More recently the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command has been enhanced to allow a comma-separated list of symbolic operations. This allows a more refined approach to modifying the ''mode'' of a file. A symbolic operation determines who it affects, the type of operation, and the affected permissions. For example:

 $ chmod u+x,g-w,o=r /usr/local/bin/bigjob

Here the &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; represent the user, group, and other (world) permissions, respectively. The &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; modify the permissions by adding, deleting, or setting the bits specified by the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; (red), &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; (write), or &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (execute) mode bits. This example gives the user execute permissions, removed write permissions for the file's group, and limits other (world) to read operations only.

The &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chgrp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; commands normally have a recursive option that acts upon a directory and all files under that directory tree. This option is typically activated with the &lt;code&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt;, but see the manual pages for your particular operating system. When combined with the symbolic operations of the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command, this can provide a powerful tool for managing permissions on a directory. For example:

 $ chmod -R o-w /usr/bin

will recursively remove any world permission bits on the &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, or any files or directories under that directory tree.

===Searching for file permissions===
The &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; can be a powerful tool for searching the file systems for files or directories with particular permission settings, as well as certain file owners and groups. In the example below (which was written for HP-UX) the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command is being used to search the &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory tree for any files that allow world write permissions.

 $ /usr/bin/find /usr/bin -type f -perm -002 -exec ls -l {} \;

The parameters passed to the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command form an expression that determines what the command is seeking in the directory tree &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;. The arguements &lt;code&gt;-type f&lt;/code&gt; restricts the search to files, instead of, say, directories, symbolic links, device files, and so forth. The &lt;code&gt;-perm -002&lt;/code&gt; sets the type of permissions to find; the minus before the number means to only match on the values that are set in the number. In this case the two in the third digit matches the world write bit. Finally the fancy &lt;code&gt;-exec ls -al {} \;&lt;/code&gt; causes the command &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; to be executed on any file that met the prior conditions. (The odd &lt;code&gt;\;&lt;/code&gt; clause at the end is a terminator of the command.)  Some variant of find has the &lt;code&gt;-ls&lt;/code&gt; option which can replace &lt;code&gt;-exec ls -al {} \;&lt;/code&gt;.

The example below shows a search of the &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; directory tree for any files with an owner that is not in the password database.

 $ /usr/bin/find /home -nouser -exec ls -l {} \;

If any accounts have been removed from the password database, a command such as this can be used to search for orphaned files.

Note that whenever the System Administrator is performing a lengthy search of the file system, it can be considerate of the users to run the &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; at a lower priority using the &lt;code&gt;nice&lt;/code&gt; command. Otherwise the job may impact disc access performance. Also some care needs to be exercised to avoid searches of network-mounted directory trees as this can significantly slow the search time; this can be achieved with the help of &lt;code&gt;-xdev&lt;/code&gt; option which limits &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to search only the current filesystem.

===umask===
Each UNIX session has a ''file mode creation mask'' that defines the initial value of the permission bits when a new file is created. This mask consists of a series of bit flags that determine whether a particular permissions setting will be turned on or off. This value is similar to the number that is passed to the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command, except that the values are used in the negative sense. That is, when a value is set in the mask the corresponding permission bit will be turned off when a file is created.

The command &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; can be used to display the mask for the current session.

 $ umask
 027
 $ touch testfile.txt
 $ ls -al testfile.txt
 -rw-r-----  1  bilbo  users    0    Jan 18 07:41 testfile.txt

In this example, the first zero affects the owner's permissions on the file. A zero means that all of the permission bits will be set, so the file owner can have read, write, and execute permissions on that file. (Note that in the example above, the system creates a file with the execute permissions turned off, regardless of the setting of the &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt;.) The middle number two affects the permissions for the file group. A '2' will turn off the write permission bit, so members of the group will only be able to read or execute the file. Finally the seven in the last digit will turn off all permissions for world.

To change the mask for the session, the &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; command can be executed with the new mask passed as a parameter.

 $ umask 077
 $ umask
 077
 $ touch testfile2.txt
 $ ls -al testfile2.txt
 -rw-------  1  bilbo  users    0    Jan 18 07:47 testfile.txt

A &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; setting of &lt;code&gt;077&lt;/code&gt; is recommended for optimal security. The user will then need to manually modify the permissions on a file or directory in order to make it available to others. Conversely, a &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; setting of &lt;code&gt;000&lt;/code&gt; results in the weakest security setting, as anybody on the system can have access to the file unless the user remembers to restrict the permissions. In order to apply a base &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; setting, the System Administrator can include a &lt;code&gt;umask&lt;/code&gt; command in the shell startup files such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/code&gt;.

The users of a Unix system are most likely not nearly as knowledgeable about the security aspects of their system as are the System Administrators. So it is important to use the configuration capabilities of the system to configure these accounts so that they are reasonably secure. Such configuration can be applied to the default user security settings, the environments in which programs will be run, and so forth. There may also be special restrictions needed for certain accounts depending on access and data security requirements on the server.

Once an account is in use, the System Administrator will still need to employ a certain level of vigilence to make certain the access is not abused, or even coopted by an inappropriate person. Passwords need to be checked for strength and periodically updated. Unused or unneeded accounts need to be disabled so that they are not employed for inappropriate purposes.

==Home directory==
When an account is first created, it is normally given a separate home directory. This is a directory, usually under the &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; or possibly the &lt;code&gt;/user&lt;/code&gt; directory tree where the user can store their data files and where custom startup and configuration files are located. (These can include &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.login&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.cshrc&lt;/code&gt;, and so forth.)

The home directory should be protected in such a manner that the user owns it and the group identifier of the directory matches the account's default group. In addition the home directory is normally given permissions that restrict access by other users. Permission modes of &lt;code&gt;750&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;700&lt;/code&gt; are common.

Many System Administrators provide a default set of startup, or &quot;dot&quot; files that are copied into the new home directory. These can provide, for example, useful aliases and site-specific operations. However these default files need to be properly secured or else they may be tampered with and any new accounts quickly compromised.

===Missing home directories===
In cases where the home directory does not exist for a particular user account, the default action on many Unix systems is to start the login session at the top-level, or ''slash'' (/) directory. This is also the default directory for the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; (''super-user'') account. So this can potentially lead to permissions problems with the startup configuration files, and other unexpected behavior.

As a remedy for this case, the home directory for the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account can be located under its own directory tree. (For example, &lt;code&gt;/root&lt;/code&gt;). Normally this directory should be placed on the same file system as ''slash'' so that the directory is always present when the system is booted. Having a private directory for &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; also provides a somewhat more secure location for any tools and scripts the System Administrator might want to run.

Once a private root home directory is implemented, the System Administrator can then modify the &quot;dot&quot; files under the ''slash'' directory and use them to provide a default set of startup files for their users.

Note that having a user log in using a home directory of ''slash'' is generally not a good idea, and it is often indicative of a problem with the system. Some versions of Unix provide a means of disabling user logins whenever their home directory is not found.

==Shell environment==
Many of the shells available for use on Unix systems allow environmental variables to be configured. Some of these variables can have security implications, and a few can be configured to enhance the system security.

===Session timeout===
When a Unix session is left unattended for a period of time, it only takes a few moments for an unscrupulous individual to take advantage of the situation to increase their own access privileges. For example, suppose that a System Administrator has walked away from their desk for a minute and a person types in a few commands at the shell prompt:

 root$ touch /tmp/rubbish
 root$ chmod 4777 /tmp/rubbish
 root$ exit

This creates a world-editable file that can be modified to run commands that can grant root privileges to anybody executing it. That individual now ''owns'' the system. It is for situations like this that it is important for unattended sessions to either be locked down or disconnected.

Certain shell types, including the Korn Shell, Bash, and some vendor versions of the Bourne Shell, will support a time out variable, either TMOUT or TIMEOUT. When this variable is set it gives the number of seconds of no activity before the shell expires. (A value of zero means no timeout.) This variable can be used to expire shells when a user or system administrator is drawn away from active login session for a period of time. Typically this variable would be set to some value, such as 300 (or 5 minutes), that will limit the period of vulnerability. It is normally set in a global shell startup file such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/etc/csh.login&lt;/code&gt;.

===PATH===
Unix shell sessions use an environment variable called PATH to determine the location of commands and other programs that can be executed from the shell command line. This variable is set to a colon-separated list of valid directories on the system. When a command is typed at the shell prompt, the system searches through each of the directories in the PATH looking for a program with a matching name. When a match is found the search ceases and the program is executed. (For reasons of efficiency, the directory path to recently executed commands can get stored in a cache.)

 $ echo $PATH
 /usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/contrib/bin:/usr/local/bin:.

In Unix a single period within the path name (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) or an empty entry (&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;) is used to represent the current working directory. Suppose an account contains just such a period in its PATH variable, and the user decides to execute a command. If the command was not located in one of the directories listed prior to the period, the system will then check the user's current working directory for a matching file. If it is found, the system will then attempt to execute the file. As the user's current working directory may be anywhere on the system where the account has access permissions, it is easy to see why this may pose a security problem.

This potential vulnerability is particularly true for the root account. Suppose root has a period at the start of their PATH variable, then a user calls up to report a problem in their home directory. It would be normal for the System Administrator to change directory to the user's home location and perform a directory listing using the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command. However if the user has placed a file called &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; in their home directory, the system will then try to execute it. This file could easily be a shell script that exploits the permissions of the root account to grant the user enhanced permissions, then simply replicates the actions of the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; call. The System Administrator might never even be aware of the inappropriate activity.

For this reason it is important that the root account in particular never have a period in its PATH variable. Note that if the value of the PATH variable begins or ends with a period, the system will treat this ''just like a period''. So, in addition, the root PATH variable should never begin or end with a colon, or have two colons next to each other with no directory in between. In any event it is often preferable for the System Administrator to type in the full command path rather than relying on the system.

If it is necessary for a user's PATH variable to include a period, it should be placed at the very end of the PATH. This will cause the system to check all of the standard directories containing executables before trying the current working directory. Setting the PATH in the shell startup script, such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/profile&lt;/code&gt;, or in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/PATH&lt;/code&gt; file on some vendor releases, can help the System Administrator manage the use of the PATH variable for most user accounts.

Another concern with the PATH variable is whether any of the directories in the PATH allow user's to modify the contents. The permissions on the directories in the PATH should all restrict write permissions, and all files within those directories should not allow write permissions. Otherwise an unscrupulous user can modify one or more of the commands, and expect other users and even root to execute their modified file. Periodic checks of the permissions on these directories and files is necessary to help maintain a secure system.

==Dot files==
These files are normally located in the home directory of an account and contain various startup and configuration settings and procedures. These are of interest to the System Administrator because in certain cases they can introduce weaknesses into the security of a Unix system.

An alert System Administrator will regularly search their system for the presence of these files, then check the permissions and contents for potential security issues. In addition to improper settings added by users, the files may be modified by an intruder so that they can regain access at some future date.

===.forward===
The &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program includes support for this file that is intended to forward e-mail messages to a new address (after a user has relocated their account, for example). The contents of this file can contain a comma-separated list of addresses. The problem with regard to security, however, is that an address can also be a system command. For example:

 sample_address@no.such.com, &quot;|/var/tmp/give_me_access&quot;

When an e-mail message arrives, it is forwarded to the addresses in the &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file. It is also passed as standard input to the program listed in strings. This could, for example, be a script written by the user to execute commands contained within the mail message.

It may be common practice to initially disable a user account by disabling the password. However if the user has configured their &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file to execute a command, they can still perform actions on the system. An unscrupulous individual may exploit this access for inappropriate activities.

====ForwardPath====
Beginning with version 8 of the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program, the ''ForwardPath'' option can be used to define alternate locations for the &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file. The ''ForwardPath'' option is set in the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; configuration by means of the &lt;code&gt;OJ&lt;/code&gt; line (or &quot;&lt;code&gt;O&amp;nbsp;ForwardPath=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;). For example:

 OJ/var/forward/$u.forward:$z/.forward

This will cause &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; to first check for a file under a &lt;code&gt;/var/forward&lt;/code&gt; directory with the name of the user's account followed by a &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt;. (Thus ''bob.forward'' would be interpreted as the &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file for the user account named ''bob''.) If the file is not found, then &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; will check for a &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file in the user's home directory.

Whenever a new user account is created, the System Administrator can then create a &lt;code&gt;''account''.forward&lt;/code&gt; file in the controlled directory. (This can be automated as part of the account creation tools.) After the user has established that they are sufficiently well-trained with UNIX to properly configure their own &lt;code&gt;.forward&lt;/code&gt; file, the &lt;code&gt;''account''.forward&lt;/code&gt; file can be removed.

===.netrc===
Users may want to use the &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; command for, say, batch downloads of files from a remote site. In order to automate this process, they can configure a &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file to provide access without the need to input a password. Once this is done, a script can be run to transfer files using, say, a scheduled batch task. Unfortunately the format of the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file stores the password in plain text. Anybody who has read access to the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file can also obtain the user's login password.

The &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; process has a built-in restriction that partially alleviates this problem. If the user's &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; can be read by anybody except the owner, the automatic login process will fail. This serves to force the owner to restrict the permissions on this file. However this is only a partial solution. A preferable approach for most purposes would be to use the host authentication method of the &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; command instead.

===.rhosts===
The &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; file can provide an autologin capability for a user when running the remote login command (usually &lt;code&gt;rlogin&lt;/code&gt;.) This bypasses the normal login process and immediately connects the user with the system. As you'd expect, this capability can introduce a number of potential vulnerabilities to a system.

Suppose that three systems are set up so that A has a trust relationship with B, but A does not necessarily trust C. The establishment of &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; for an account to connect between A&amp;mdash;B and B&amp;mdash;C, can provide a back door for an individual to get from C to A. That is, somebody who manages to obtain inappropriate access to C can use the &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; file to obtain access to A, even though C is not trusted by A (and may even have network access blocked).

Another issue with the &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; file is the method used to enter the allowed account access. The file can be set up to allow access from any host. For example:

 + joebob

will allow the account ''joebob'' to connect from any host without entering a password. Unfortunately, the account may belong to an entirely different person on another system, or it could be deliberately established on a compromised system to allow inappropriate access.

Due to the security dangers inherant in its use, it is usually better to disable the &lt;code&gt;.rhosts&lt;/code&gt; capability where possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''System processes of UNIX''' consist of those processes that are not user services or user processes. One of the most known is '''init'''.

== Init ==
The parent of all processes. '''init''' will take ownership of orphaned processes. Process ID is almost always 1. 

== Viewing processes ==
For example, a user may list the status of his or her processes using the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command, thus:

  $ ps -f
  UID         PID  PPID  C     STIME TTY      TIME CMD
  john_doe  15265 15254  0  11:18:13 pts/5   00:00 -sh
  john_doe  11407 15265  1  13:52:09 pts/5   00:00 ps -f

The user with the account name &lt;code&gt;john_doe&lt;/code&gt; is the owner of the two processes with process identifiers 15265 and 11407. That user can send signals to those two processes using the &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command. However the system can prevent that user from using the &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt; command on processes he does not own.

----

==Telnet==
Telnet was once an extremely popular method of remote access.
However, it has been almost entirely replaced by SSH.
Perhaps the only remaining legitimate use of Telnet is low-level debugging of other internet protocols such as HTTP and SMTP.

The &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; command is used to establish a connection with another host that can be accessed via the network, and communicate with it using the ''TELNET'' protocol. Typically &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; is used to connect to a user login via the standard TELNET port. For the default configuration, the login password is sent across the network in clear-text form. That is to say, if the network packets between the two hosts are being read by some intermediary, then the password string will appear in the packets in a readable form. Likewise any data sent through during the session will also appear in readable form, including any other secure information sent to the remote hosts.

Normally, if you want to maintain the security of your communications, the default configuration of telnet should only be employed on network segments that you are highly confident are secure. Establishing such a network is becoming increasingly difficult, however, unless of course it is kept physically isolated. (Even then it is never possible to be 100% certain.)

A method of securing the password using &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; is to configure it to run as a &lt;code&gt;Kerberos&lt;/code&gt; client, when this functionality is available. The &lt;code&gt;Kerberos&lt;/code&gt; client will support secure authentication, and help maintain the secrecy of the password string. However this will not provide an encrypted session, so data transmission subsequent to the login will remain vulnerable to interception.

Something that can be said in favor of &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt;, from a security perspective, is that it typically lacks the means to bypass the login sequence that is available to the Berkeley remote login commands, such as &lt;code&gt;rlogin&lt;/code&gt;. This reduces the risk of back-door access methods of the later commands.

The &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; service can normally be configured to display a text banner prior to the presentation of the login prompt. This banner can be useful for presenting a carefully-worded warning to anybody accessing the system. So in this sense it is like a &quot;Do Not Trespass&quot; sign on a piece of property. If somebody is presented this warning prior to login, then they can not claim ignorance of what they were trying to access. The presence and consistent use of  a login banner can be useful in the event that a prosecution of an individual for unauthorized access becomes necessary.

===/etc/securetty===
The &lt;code&gt;/etc/securetty&lt;/code&gt; file is used to enable login security. When the file exists, the ''root'' account is only allowed to login via the listed devices in the file, one per line. To prevent direct remote connection via the ''root'' account, a recommended practice is to only include the single entry &lt;code&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; within this file. Note that this does not prevent a System Administrator from connecting to the system via their user account and then executing an &lt;code&gt;su&amp;nbsp;-&lt;/code&gt; to become ''root''. In fact this is a recommended method as it allows usage of the ''root'' account to be logged.

When the &lt;code&gt;/etc/securetty&lt;/code&gt; file is created it should be properly restricted to prevent modification from any accounts except ''root''. Thus an owner and group of &lt;code&gt;root:sys&lt;code&gt; and a file mode of &lt;code&gt;640&lt;/code&gt; would effectively secure this file.

==ftp==
The File Transfer Protocol is intended to allow the reliable transmission of files between two systems on the network. It has two network ports, usually 20 and 21, and uses ''tcp'' for reliable packet transfer. (Port 20 is employed for data transfer, while port 21 is used for session control.)

Connecting to a remote system via &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; requires a login at the destination. However unless a secure authentication system such as kerberos has been enabled, the password will be transmitted across the network in the clear. That is, anybody using a packet sniffer to intercept the session packets will be able to read the password. In addition, any data files are also sent in unencrypted form. This uprotected version of &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; should only be used across a secure network, or in cases where security is not an issue. (See ''anonymous ftp'' below.) For encrypted login and file transmission, the Secure Shell software can be used. However, at least at present, the &lt;code&gt;sftp&lt;/code&gt; command equivalent does not have as rich a set of supported commands as does the standard version of &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt;.

There are several other features of &lt;code&gt;ftp&lt;/code&gt; that can present a security issue for the System Administrator. The first of these is the use of the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file in a user's home directory. This file can be configured to allow automatic connection to a remote site without the need to provide an account name or password. However, any passwords stored in &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; are in an unencrypted form. So if an unauthorized person is able to gain read access to the &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; file (such as by compromising the system) they may also be able to gain access to other remote systems. To prevent this situation, many System Administrators will regularly search their systems for &lt;code&gt;.netrc&lt;/code&gt; files and then either remove them or check their contents.

The &lt;i&gt;ftp&lt;/i&gt; daemon can be configured to allow a form of access that is known as &quot;anonymous ftp&quot;. This allows any individual from a remote site to connect by typing &quot;anonymous&quot; at the login prompt, then entering any string as a password. (By convention the password is usually entered in the form of an e-mail address, but this is a courtesy only.) An improperly configured anonymous ftp capability can present a host of weaknesses that can be exploited by an intruder.

The instructions for how to properly configure an ''anonymous ftp'' account are usually given in the manual pages for the ''ftp'' daemon. If this service is required, great care should be taken to follow the documented instructions. In particular, the &lt;code&gt;~ftp/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file should not include encrypted password information, and only the ''ls'' command should be in the &lt;code&gt;~ftp/usr/bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory and have 111 permissions.

''More here...''

Many vendors have adopted the ''wu-ftpd'' flavor of the File Transfer Protocol. This incorporates additional features in the ftp configuration, many of which can be used to enhance the security of a system. 

''More to come...''

==Sendmail==
The &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program is used to send, relay, and receive electronic mail using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Unfortunately it has had a spotted history with respect to security vulnerabilities and exploits. For this reason it is important to take advantage of any security features that have been added to &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt;, and to apply the latest security patches to this product as they become available.

On each system where it is loaded, &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; reads a file that is used to store a list of mail aliases. These aliases are e-mail addresses that the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; program translates into another form, such as a distribution list of e-mail addresses. One of the built-in features of the alias list is the ability to execute a shell command using a ''prog mailer''.

Here is an example of just such an entry:
 save_debug_message   : &quot;|/usr/local/bin/record_bug.sh&quot;,debug_log

When an e-mail message is sent to the ''save_debug_message'' address on this server, its &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; daemon executes the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/record_bug.sh&lt;/code&gt; command and passes the mail message to the script as standard input.

As you might expect, this capability can readily introduce security vulnerabilities into the system. Messages with arbitrary content can be sent to this address, and if it does not securely process the data a suitably-formatted e-mail could potentially be used to compromise the system. Likewise if the script is not securely protected, users on the system can modify it for their own purposes. A user with a terminated account might even be able to regain access by this means.

A capability that was introduced to try and limit the amount of damage that an aliased command could introduced was the use of the &lt;code&gt;smrsh&lt;/code&gt; shell. When the &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; process is configured to use &lt;code&gt;smrsh&lt;/code&gt; as the ''prog mailer'', it limits the capabilities of the script being executed. The System Administrator can restrict the commands that can be run in the script to a small set of &quot;safe&quot; commands. The ''prog mailer'' is configured in the &lt;code&gt;sendmail.cf&lt;/code&gt; configuration file using the &lt;code&gt;Mprog&lt;/code&gt; option.

----
Log files are generated by system processes to record activities for subsequent analysis. They can be useful tools for troubleshooting system problems and also to check for inappropriate activity. The UNIX releases are preconfigured to record certain information in log files, but configuration settings are available to increase the amount of information recorded.

Log files can be very useful resources for security incident investigations. They can also be essential for prosecution of criminal activity. For these reasons log files should be periodically backed up to separate media, and precautions need to be taken to prevent tampering with the log files. It is expected that an unauthorized intruder into a computing system will attempt to remove any trace of their activities from the system log files.

For log files that tend to grow significantly in size over the course of time, it can be good practice to periodically rotate the logs. That is to say, rename the current log file to a name in a sequence, and start a new log. Here is an example of rotating a log file called &lt;code&gt;mylog&lt;/code&gt;:

  $ cd /var/adm
  $ test -f mylog.2 &amp;&amp; mv -f mylog.2 mylog.3
  $ test -f mylog.1 &amp;&amp; mv -f mylog.1 mylog.2
  $ test -f mylog.log &amp;&amp; cp -p mylog mylog.1
  $ :&gt;mylog

The effect of this is to rotate the log through three copies before it is finally overwritten. A script can be used to run this periodically, thus keeping the log file trimmed. (The log files should be backed up to media at some point.) Rotating the log files helps minimizes the disk space usage, thus avoiding a denial of service event due to a full file system.

==Syslog==
The system log is a log file that is maintained by the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; daemon. This log file can collect a variety of useful information, including panic conditions, data corruption, hardware errors, as well as warnings and tracking information. This log file can be written to from a shell or script by means of the &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; command. Messages are sent to the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; daemon, which processes them according to a configuration defined by a special file (such as &lt;code&gt;/etc/syslog.conf&lt;/code&gt;).

Events passed to the &lt;code&gt;syslog&lt;/code&gt; are defined by a set of facilities and log levels. Combinations of facilities and log levels can be processed in different manners, or ignored altogether. For example, all error messages can be copied to the &lt;code&gt;syslog.log&lt;/code&gt; file and e-mailed to the System Administrator, alerts can be printed to the console, mail debug messages can be added to a &lt;code&gt;mail.log&lt;/code&gt; file, and so forth.

Certain services or daemons can be configured to log information to the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; file. These can include the &lt;code&gt;inetd&lt;/code&gt; file, which on some systems can be configured to provide additional logging information. Among the types of information that can be logged is remote user login attempts and successes, including the client host from where the user is connecting. In some circumstances this can be useful for helping tracing the origin of an inappropriate or erroneous connection.

Some versions of &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; can be configured to read log messages broadcast over the network. However it is possible to flood this socket with invalid messages, thus leading to a rapid growth of the log file and a potential denial of service. For this reason it is often a good idea to disable this network logging capability in the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt; startup.

There are several options for maintaining a system log that is difficult if not impossible for an intruder to clean up. These can be configured by means of the &lt;code&gt;/etc/syslog.conf&lt;/code&gt; file.

* A printer can be dedicated to recording log messages on hard copy. The old line printers were especially useful for this purpose as the messages could be viewed immediately, rather than waiting for a page to fill.
* The daemon can forward messages to a secure system on the network. If the server is compromised, the messages will still be stored safely on the remote host.
* The log messages can be copied to a device that is configured for write-once, read-many operations. This could be a CD-ROM recording or a specially-configured tape drive.

The System Administrator should also be wary of misleading log messages. Users can add log entries using the &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; command, and this can be employed as a prank or nuisance factor.

==Other logs==
There are other log files that can sometimes be useful in tracking accesses and activities.

* The line printer daemon (&lt;code&gt;lpd&lt;/code&gt;) is normally used to dispatch an output job to a printer. This can either print to a locally attached device, or forward the print jobs to a remote printer on a different server. The print jobs are recorded in a log file, usually giving the printer name, the account running the print job, and the date and time. This could potentially be useful in tracking access attempts.

* The &lt;code&gt;sendmail&lt;/code&gt; daemon can be used to send and receive electronic mail between UNIX systems using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The daemon can be configured to log information about e-mail messages sent, received, and relayed. It can be used to troubleshoot e-mail issues as well as to look for unusual mail activity. The log messages are sent to the system via the &lt;code&gt;syslogd&lt;/code&gt;, which is often configured to save mail-related messages to a dedicated log file.

==Auditing==
Auditing is normally a built-in capability that can be activated on a UNIX system. It is a requirement for C-2 trusted system security.

The audit system must be activated in order to begin collecting data. This data acquisition does come at a cost, as it can consume as much as 10% of the system CPU time. The data is stored in a file, which can then be analyzed using the available audit system commands.

The audit subsystem can collect data on events, system calls, and user activities. Auditing can collect a significant amount of data, which can then be examined for information about the system calls being run, the users calling the system commands, and the modifications made.

The particulars of the auditing configuration can vary depending on the particular flavor of the UNIX OS, so it is best for the System Administrator to review the manual pages on the subject. Usually there is an ''audit'' man page, which is a good place to start.

As the audit file can potentially grow without bounds, management of the file is necessary, usually on a daily basis. This can be done by rotating the log files and backing up the logs to separate media. The audit capability typically has a threshold setting that will cause the auditing to switch to an alternate log file under certain conditions. This audit file is often placed on a different file system in case the threshold switch is triggered by the original file system reaching a disk usage limit.

The audit logs should be regularly monitored to check for activity that needs to be tracked. Usually this can be achieved by means of a cron job that summarizes the log entries and looks for inappropriate events. In addition, regularly storing the audit event logs on separate media can be useful for the purposes of investigation of unauthorized access, &amp;c.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Suggested topics:'' server room, media storage and network connections.

The physical security of your computing infrastructure is at least as important as the measures that are applied at the software level. Unauthorized individuals gaining access to a server room can intercept network transmissions, cause servers to reboot from inserted media, or perform malicious destruction of your systems and data.

Companies that value their server computing resources will typically place the systems in isolated rooms with carefully managed environments and protections against power outages. Access to server rooms is limited by means of locks that can require combination codes, special digital cards, or biometric devices. The interior can be monitored using surveillance systems, such as ceiling-mounted camera domes. Perimeter defense is provided by building access mechanisms and security personnel.

However not all the computing infrastructure can be protected to this degree. Access to the network and internal servers can be acquired by accessing an office terminal or workstation. Data can be removed or stolen by the theft of a laptop or disk drive. It is also a simple matter to obtain valuable data, then to copy it onto media for easy removal.

==Reboot==
When an intruder has physical access to a server, they may be able to reboot the system from alternate media. With the system up, they may be able to mount up the file systems on the server and make whatever changes they would like. When the system is rebooted normally, they may have inserted changes that allow unauthorized privileges.  Removalable media devices, such as CD-ROM, floppy disk, magnetic tape or USB disks (including USB ''pen drives'') should be removed from the list of bootable devices, or placed after the primary boot device.

If a removable media device is not present, the system can still be booted into single-user mode. If this level has not been protected by a login prompt, the system can be modified with privileges equivalent to root. Vendors will typically implement a Boot Authentication feature only allows authorized users to boot a system to Single-user mode.  Boot authentication can take the form of a BIOS supported power-on password or a specialized program, such as the [[Linux]] ''sulogin'' command which requires a password before granting access in Single-user mode.

{{wikipedia|backup}}
Backup is very essential in an environment where your data is precious, and that to a subset of data for almost any computer user, when planning for a backup system, there are some questions you need to answer:

*What do i want to backup?
*How often do i want to backup?
*Where to save the backup?
*How long do i need the backup?
*How long does it take to get the backup replace a damaged system after a disaster?
*Whats the format i want to my backup to be in?
*How to backup ?
*How to minimize backup time when doing frequent backups?
*How to verify the integrity and accuracy of my backups? 

if you are desinging your system in a way to make it easy to backup, you could take in consideration selecting a filing system that supports usefull features, such as snapshots, XFS support, and ufs2 for (free?)bsd, LVM on linux has nice snapshot features too.
==backup tools==
backup tools can be devided according to what they backup, file/directory backup tools, disk backup tools and data backup tools (database dumps for example)

UNIX systems provide many tools that help in backing up files, most commonly known is the tar command which allows creating archives and preserver ownership/time-date/permessions  on the files being archived. those tar archives can also easily be compressed, using gzip for example.

another tool to backup is &quot;dump&quot; and &quot;restore&quot;, which dumps entire filing systems and treats it as a collection of disk blocks, can be configured in /etc/fstab
*cpio
*tar([[Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_Compression#tar]]):
** tar puts multiple files and directories in one archive, note that tar actually stands for '''T'''ape '''Ar'''chive, so it inherents a lot from the ar command (archive), tar can compress archives too, some of the options that can be passed to tar are:
*** c : create archive
*** x : extract archive
*** t : list
*** z : work with gz compression to create compressed archives or extract compressed archives or list the content.
*** v : operate verbosily (print out what files were progressed)
*** f file: to specify the file name you are dealing with.
*rdiff
===remote backup===
*rsync
* tar to remote machine:
** tar czf uwe@remotehost:/path/remote localpath
*tar over ssh tunneling 
:example
 tar czf - someDir | ssh user@domain tar -C somDirToExtractTo xzf -

==open source backup systems==
*amanda
*bacula
*[http://dev.riseup.net/backupninja/ backupninja]
*[http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/ backupPC]
===disaster recovery tool===
*mondo
==data base backup==
A fine idea that can be used for database backup is based on a combination of volume snapshots and table locking, the idea is that to keep you database consistent and minimize the time you lock the tables, you can do the following:
#lock the tables
#take a volume snapshot (very short time) 
#unlock the tables
#read the tables with an appropriate tool from the volume snapshot
==Continuous Data Protection (CDP) and Near-CDP==
*Near CDP is basically snapshot and replication.
*CDP is a little diffrent, when RPO is very little, as little as few seconds, then CDP is needed.

==hardware involved in backup solutions==
*NAS
*SAN
*Tape

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Its partha here. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Its partha here~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cacumer. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cacumer~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

= Disjunctions in Derivations =

Disjunctions in derivations are, as the current inference rules stand, difficult to deal with.  Using an already derived disjunction by applying Disjunction Elimination (DE) is not too bad, but there is an easier to use alternative.  Deriving a disjunction in the first place is more difficult.  Our Disjunction Introduction (DI) rule turns out to be a rather anemic tool for this task.  In this module, we introduce derived rules which provide alternative methods for dealing with disjunctions in derivations.

== Using already derived disjunctions ==

=== Modus Tollendo Ponens ===

We start with a new (to be) derived rule of inference.  This will provide a useful alternative to Disjunction Elimination (DE).

: Modus Tollendo Ponens, Form I (MTP)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \varphi \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: Modus Tollendo Ponens, Form II (MTP)
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\lnot \psi \quad \quad}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Modus Tollendo Ponens is sometimes known as Disjunctive Syllogism and occasionally as the Rule of the Dog.

=== Supporting theorems ===

This new rule requires the following two supporting theorems.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T16.} \quad (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

After Line 4, we did not bother with subderivations for deriving the antecedent lines needed for DE.  Instead, we went straight to a subderivation for the conclusion's consequent.  At line 8, we applied MTP.

== Deriving disjunctions ==

=== Conditional Disjunction ===

The next derived rule significantly reduces the labor of deriving disjunctions, thus providing a useful alternative to Disjunction Introduction (DI).

: Conditional Disjunction (CDJ)
:: &lt;math&gt;\underline{(\lnot \varphi \rightarrow \psi)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varphi \lor \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Supporting theorem ===

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T18.} \quad (\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example derivation ===

This derivation will make use of '''T12''' (introduced at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Derived Inference Rules | Derived Inference Rules]]) even though its proof was left to the reader as an exercise.  The correctness the following derivation, particularly Line 2, assumes that you have indeed proved '''T12'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consciousness-only is the foundation of a buddhist theory known as vijnanavada. Proponents, notably the Yogacara school, suggest that the sum of experience exists only in our minds. Philosophers recognition of this view as subjective idealism is a matter of discussion because these traditions often deny the existence of ontological subject. These views are rooted in the denial of existence of any kind of ontological substance (as Matter, Soul, God, etc.). Consciousness-only views can also be found in taoist philosophy, notably Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The people of Cambodia are the descendants of the Khmer empire.

== What Country did they live in? ==
[[Image:Reisfelder_Kambodscha_Angkor2001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Rice paddys in Cambodia. Rice has been grown by the Khmer in Cambodia for thousands of years.]]The Khmer people lived in the country today known as Cambodia. Cambodians to this day introduce themselves as Khmer. At its largest the Khmer kingdom extended into what is now Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam.

== How did the civilization rise and fall? ==
Little is known about the origin of the Khmer people before their arrival in south east Asia. But legend says that a race called Mon-Khmer used to live in eastern India, which is now present day Bangladesh. Traces of Mon-Khmer culture and vocabulary still exist in the Bengali vocabulary. The oldest Khmer settlement in Cambodia was established around 1000 BCE. From the 1st to 6th century CE, Cambodia was the part of the south Asian kingdom, Funan. The first kingdom of the Khmer people was built by King Jayavarman II and later he was succeeded by his son Jayavarman III. During the reign of these two monarchs, the Great Angkor kingdom of Cambodia was built. Later in 1431 Angkor was captured and destroyed by the Siamese (current day Thailand). After this, the French claimed Cambodia as a colony. Independence from France was granted in 1953. This was followed by the establishment of a totalitarian government intermixed with episodes of anarchy and feudalism.

[[image:Angkor Wat W-Seite.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Angkor Wat is a huge stone temple built by the Khmer.]]

== What did their buildings look like? ==
Khmer people lived in houses made of bamboo and wood. These houses were built so that they were raised off of the ground on poles. Much of area around the Mekong river where the Khmer lived flooded during summer monsoons. This type of house was very practical and kept the inhabitants dry.

During the Angkorian kingdom the Khmer also built many fine stone temples. The Khmer were accomplished stone workers. One of the most famous of these temples is Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat, first constructed in the twelfth century, is the largest religious structure in the world. It has five large domes which are shaped like flower buds surrounded by terraces. Most of the temple is built from sandstone blocks. Carved reliefs in the walls show various religious scenes. The temple is surrounded by a moat. {{clr}}

== What did they eat? ==
[[Image:Khmerfood1.JPG|right|thumbnail|300px|Crabs are a traditional food of the Khmer.]]
Archaeological findings prove that Khmer people's diet consisted of fish and rice in 1000 BCE. For many hundreds of years the Khmer have used irrigation to bring water to their rice paddys. There are also stone carvings dating back hundreds of years showing large fisheries. It wasn't just fish and rice though, the Khmer also ate other water creatures including crabs, frogs, shrimp and snails. They also grew a variety of vegetables and fruits. The coconut is and has been an important addition to the Khmer diet.

According to accounts by a visitor from China during ancient times, the Khmer ate soup from bowls made from woven leaves. Still today, a Cambodian meal almost always includes a soup, which is eaten with the other courses. Fish is the nation's mainstay, and dried fish are used in many dishes. Soups are sometimes made with coconut milk. 'Salad' dishes are flavored with coriander, mint and lemon grass - three flavors which find their way into many Cambodian dishes.

== What did they wear? ==
Men wore Sarongs and women wore Sampots. Both garments are a kind of loose fitting skirt gathered at the waist. Both men and women were generally bare from the waist up. Bas relief sculptures show both men and women wearing elaborate beaded necklaces, ear-rings, bracelets, anklets and elaborate head-dresses.

[[Image:Srokkmae.png|200px|thumb|right|An example of Khmer writing.]]
== What did their writing look like?==
The Khmer script developed from the Pallava script of India. The oldest inscription in Khmer dates from 611 CE. It is engraved in stone. Khmer is written left to right like English or Latin. The symbols it uses are more complex than the letters used in English. Some of the symbols have hooks and loops as well as dots and flowing lines. 

Khmer writing uses symbols to represent consonants and vowels. Khmer has fewer symbols for vowels than the language has vowel sounds. Because of this, most vowel signs have two possible pronunciations, depending on which consonant is being used.

== What did they believe? ==
The Khmer practiced a number of religions as well as the variety of belief systems. The Khmer Empire's official religions included Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism and Theravada Buddhism. 

This religious diversity is reflected in the Khmer of today as well. The descendants of the Khmer have religious beliefs and practices which combine the tenets of Theravada Buddhism with ancestor-spirit worship, astrology, and shamanism. The wat (Buddhist temple) is the center of religious life for many Khmer. When sick they often consult a kru khmae (shaman/healer) for herbal medicine and spiritual healing. Khmer beliefs also rely on astrology, a remnant of their Hinduism. A fortune teller, called hao-ra, is consulted before major events like beginning an important journey or determining the proper location for building new structures.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
Prince Norodom Sihanouk won Cambodia's independence from France. Pol Pot was an infamous dictator, more than one million people were killed by execution, starvation and in forced labor camps during his rule of Cambodia. Photographer Dith Pran had a book and movie made about his life called The Killing Fields. He helped chronicle the atrocities of the Pol Pot regime.

== What is left of them today? ==
Many Cambodians are descendants of the Khmer, and the Khmer language is the official language of Cambodia.

Is this the right place to point out that the Rhetoric section uses &quot;they,&quot;  a plural pronoun to refer to a singular antecedent throughout many passages?  It's challenging to edit around this, but it can be done. If this is the sort of editing that this projects seeks, I'll undertake it; but I don't want to overwrite someone's extensive effort without a heads up or a courtesy note to acknowledge the overall worth and value of the core contribution. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post; I'm learning the ropes.
M.Johnson Tarnowski (Old Word Wolf)

Sure, why not. Needs to be consistent across book, less formal.

Good work on the Rhetoric and Composition book.  It's interesting to see it come together. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:54, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

Re your msg on my talk page (missplased on my user page ;) ). You did forget to point out what pages you meant I was doing &quot;dramatic&quot; cuts to. I guess it was my removal of possible Copyright violation (and &quot;confirmed&quot; copyright violation) Pictures on the [Rhetoric and Composition] modules. I'v taken notice of you'r comment and will use the talk page for &quot;greyzone cuts&quot;. Sincerly [[User:Oyvind|Oyvind]] 22:21, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

There is no problem with the title img on [Rhetoric and Composition]. Have put it back up, in a little more &quot;annonymus&quot; size. [[User:Oyvind|Oyvind]] 11:04, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

==User page==
May I propose that you edit your user page and introduce yourself shortly, perhaps mentioning that you are a major contributor to Rhetoric and Composition? I think you and your students made a great job on the book, unless I am mistaking your identity. Thanks a lot for your work. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 20:10, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

Hi there! Your Rhetoric and Composition textbook looks like a great project. I have a similar project just starting in conjunction with the [http://saylor.org Saylor Foundation].

Be all that as it may, I've yet to find any book, online or otherwise, that doesn't go into the history of the Mac pre-1984. I see where you're trying to work on a compromise of background and information pertinent to just the Mac, but you might want to re-order it so that it's chronological. --[[User:JohnDBuell|JohnDBuell]] 22:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

== Re: [[Apple Macintosh]] ==

Thank you! Well, I don't think I'll b contributing to Wikibooks in a major way in the foreseeable future (I get less work done on Wikipedia and Commons than i'd like even now), so I won't join your project. I've linked it from [[:w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Macintosh]] however, maybe some other contributors will follow it ;) Anyway, if the Tiger book is the only one with real value, the redirect is perfect for now. Keep up the good work, and maybe I'll eventually come over here and do some work after all. --[[User:Grm wnr|Grm wnr]] 20:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Revolución. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Revolución~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preface ==
This text was written as a reference on the law of evidence in criminal law. The audience for this text will be mostly criminal law practitioners, police officers, and law students, who need a convenient way to look up principles and case law. Where possible there are links to cited cases on CanLII for ease of reference.

As of this writing, this text remains a work in progress. Errors and omissions should be expected and so it is always recommended that source materials be consulted to confirm the contents of these materials. Any contributions, be they simply correcting citations, copy editing, or substantive contributions, would be greatly appreciated. 

I continue to actively review and edit these series texts on a regular basis. You can contact myself at PullUpYourSocks1@gmail.com, if you have any questions or comments.

==Organization of the Book==
This book is set out in three sections. First section covers the basic elements that make up the rules of evidence, such as basis for accepting evidence, burdens and standards of proof, as well as shortcuts to proof.

The second section cover the types of evidence the law recognizes. Specifically, oral, document or real evidence. These chapters cover the requirements for these types of evidence to be accepted into evidence, including competency of witnesses and authentication of certain types of evidence.

The final section covers the many rules that limit or exclude evidence. This includes a variety of principles from opinion evidence, character evidence, hearsay, admissions, and privilege.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Evidence provides a means of allowing facts to be proved for the purpose of deciding issues in litigation. Only evidence that is admissible, material and relevant can be considered. Even then evidence can often have the side-effect of creating prejudice, and if the prejudicial effect is more significant than the probative value, it might be ruled inadmissible for that reason.

For a trier-of-fact to receive evidence, the judge must be satisfied that the evidence is:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915 , per Watt J.A. at para 46 - requires evidence be (1) relevant (2) material (3) admissible&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 96 - sets out the four points of admissibility&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# relevant, 
# material, 
# not barred by rules of admissibly, and 
# not subject to discretionary exclusion.

Once relevance and materiality is established the remaining steps tend to reduce the scope of admissibility by excluding evidence.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Relevance==

Evidence must be relevant before it can be admissible, irrelevant evidence must be excluded. &lt;Ref&gt;Hollington v. Hewthorn &amp; Co. Ltd., [1943] K.B. 587 (C.A.), at p. 594 (“all evidence that is relevant to an issue is admissible, while all that is irrelevant is excluded”)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevance is &quot;assessed in the context of the entire case and the positions of counsel.  It requires a determination whether, as a matter of human experience and logic, the existence of a particular fact, directly or indirectly, makes the existence or non-existence of a material fact more probable than it would be otherwise&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cloutier 1979 CanLII 25 (SCC), (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 27 and referenced in Watt's Manual of Criminal Evidence, 2010, (Thomson Carswell: Toronto, 2008) at Section 3.0 &lt;/ref&gt;

Certain evidence does not cease to be relevant or become irrelevant simply because it can support more than one inference. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Underwood [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2002/2002abca310/2002abca310.html 2002 ABCA 310] at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevance is sometimes divided into 1) logical relevance and 2) legal relevance.&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohan [1994] 2 SCR 9&lt;/ref&gt; Logical relevance, as discussed above, refers to the connection between two facts. Legal relevance is the cost/benefit analysis of the admission of evidence on the basis of probative value outweighing prejudicial effect.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Materiality==
Evidence must be material to be considered by a court. Material evidence refers to evidence that is contributes to proving a fact that is of consequence to the trial. That is, there must be a relationship between the evidence and a legal issue put to the court.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Gill (1987) 39 CCC (3d) 506 (MBCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Rules of Admissibility==
All courts can only consider admissible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;See also R. v. Zeolkowski (1987) 333 CCC 231; R. v .Hawkes (1915) 25 CCC 29 (ABCA)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Where evidence is relevant and material the evidence should be admitted unless their exclusion is justified.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Collins 2001 CanLII 24124 (ON CA) at para. 18, 19&lt;br&gt;
Cyr at para. 116&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the entirety of the rules of evidence concern the question of what is admissible evidence. As such, admissibly of evidence can be better understood as evidence that is not prohibited by an exclusionary rules. To name the most frequently encountered rules of exclusion include:
# hearsay
# opinion
# witness competence
# character
# illegally obtained evidence
# conduct on other occasions

In addition to this, there is always a residual common law discretion to exclude evidence.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Discretionary Exclusion ==
Even where evidence is relevant, material, and admissible, the court retains a discretionary ability to exclude evidence where the probative value of the evidence is exceeded by its prejudicial effect. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cloutier, 1979 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, 48 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 12 C.R. (3d) 10&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Smith, 1992 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, 75 C.C.C. (3d) 257, 15 C.R. (4th) 133&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Moose, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j3h8 2004 MBCA 176], 24 C.R. (6th) 246, 190 Man. R. (2d) 156&lt;br&gt;
R. v. F. (M.) [http://canlii.ca/t/25882 2009 ONCA 617] at para. 25&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, 1994 CanLII 80 (S.C.C.) at pp. 20-21&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is primarily inclusionary and will tend to admit all evidence that is logically probative of some fact in issue, subject to the rules of exclusion and exception. Where it does not fall into an exclusion or exception issues with the evidence only goes to weight.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Corbett 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385&lt;/ref&gt;

The discretionary power allows for a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the value of the evidence to determine the case correctly &quot;is worth the cost of its introduction to the litigation process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 96, 97&lt;br&gt;
Mohan, at pp. 20-21&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This will involve considering the prejudicial effect including the misleading effect and time consumption.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 97
&lt;/ref&gt;

The onus is upon the accused to establish that evidence otherwise admissible should be excluded as prejudicial.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Jack 1992 CanLII 2764 (MB CA), (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 67, 15 W.C.B. (2d) 92 (Man. C.A.), at p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The court should consider the discretion to exclude evidence as follows:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. P. (R.) (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. H.C.) at 347&lt;/ref&gt;
#The judge must determine the probative value of the evidence assessing its tendency to prove a fact in issue in the case including the credibility of the witnesses.
#The judge must determine the prejudicial effect of the evidence because of its tendency to prove matters which are not in issue... or because of the risk that the jury may use the evidence improperly to prove a fact in issue.
#The judge must balance the probative value against the prejudicial effect having regard to the importance of the issues for which the evidence is legitimately offered against the risk that the jury will use it for other improper purposes, taking into account the effectiveness of any limiting instructions.

In a jury setting, the judge must be scrupulous to only permit evidence that is &quot;worthy of jury consideration&quot; and &quot;not whether the jury should accept and act upon the evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 98 citing R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII) at para. 89&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-jury settings, the judge need not be as scrupulous. The judge is performing a gate-keeping function and so is capable of distinguishing prejudicial evidence. It is unreasonable that the judge is prejudiced from merely hearing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
see e.g. R v Virani, 2012 ABCA 155 (CanLII) at paras 13-14&lt;br&gt;
TG v Nova Scotia (Community Services), 2012 NSCA 43 at para 75 leave to SCC denied&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where prejudices exist the judges are capable of self-warning of the risks of the evidence. This will often be considered sufficient precaution.&lt;ref&gt;
see R v Blea, 2012 ABCA 41 at para 49&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;
A judge who is satisfied he are not prejudice should be taken at his word.
R v O’Brien, 2011 SCC 29 (CanLII) at para 18, [2011] 2 SCR 485 (“The trial judge was entitled to be taken at his word.”)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of this discretion requires substantial deference on appeal absent error in principle.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. B. (C.R.), 1990 CanLII 142 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 733&lt;br&gt;
Cyr at para. 103
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
=== Probative value ===
Probative value concerns the weight put on evidence and ''not'' its admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;
Morris v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpds 1983 CanLII 28] (SCC), [1983] 2 SCR 190 at pp. 99-100 (C.C.C.) pp.192-3 (S.C.R.) - cites example of documents of heroine trade found in accused's residence&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining the probative value of evidence includes considering the &quot;frailties of the evidence, the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from it and the availability of other evidence to prove the same fact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Leitch and Jno-Baptiste, [http://canlii.ca/t/fp73k 2011 ONSC 2597]  citing R. v. Pascoe [http://canlii.ca/t/6hq3 1997 CanLII 1413] (ON CA), (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 126 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Probative value includes considering its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability factor is particularly important when considering expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 97 citing Mohan at p. 21&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist|2}}

=== Prejudicial Effect===
Although the first rule of evidence is to admit all relevant evidence there are certain types of relevant evidence that should not be admitted as it will have a prejudicial effect on the fairness of the trial.  It is said that there are three grounds of excluding evidence on the basis of it prejudice: &quot;moral&quot;, &quot;logical&quot;, and &quot;time&quot;. 

Prejudice is not simply evidence that is harmful to the defence case, but rather it is evidence that will create unfairness by misuse, over consumption of time, or distraction/confusion of issues. The impact will effect &quot;fairness and the integrity of the proceedings&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577; R. v. Collins 2001 CanLII 24124 (ON CA), (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 85, 150 O.A.C. 220 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

All judges have a discretion to exclude any evidence on the basis that its prejudicial effect will out-weigh the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mohan 1994 CanLII 80 (S.C.C.), (1994) 29 C.R. (4th) 243 (S.C.C.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii80/1994canlii80.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where evidence is relevant to one count but irrelevant and possibly prejudicial to another count, the court may still admit the evidence but provide a limiting instruction to the jury on the limited use of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cote, (2003) 176 CCC (3d) 89&lt;/ref&gt;

When the evidence is called by the defence the balance between probative value and prejudicial effect is weighed further in the side of admission. A judge should only exclude evidence where the prejudicial effect &quot;substantially outweighs&quot; the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Shearing, [2002] 3 SCR 33&lt;br&gt;
R v Seaboyer, [1991] 2 SCR 577&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clarke, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v98k 1998 CanLII 14604] (ON CA)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

When dealing with a jury we must presume that limiting instructions and cautions will be followed and the evidence will be &quot;confined within its proper bounds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 99&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Corbett, 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 692-693&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In review, the absence of objection will be a factor in considering if the evidence is significantly prejudicial.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Jaw, 2009 SCC 42 (CanLII), [2009] 3 SCR 26 at para 44, citing R v Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 314 at paras 37-38&lt;br&gt; 
R v Daley, 2007 SCC 53 (CanLII), [2007] 3 SCR 523 at para 58&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Moral and Logical Prejudice===
First, there is evidence of ''moral prejudice'' which has the potential of creating outrage in the jury and could influence them to make their decision based on emotion. For example, a jury may get the urge to punish an accused for past bad acts even though they are not at issue in the trial. Second, there are ''logical prejudices'' that suggest to the jury to make improper inferences, such as relating the accused race with a particular disposition. 

In a non-jury setting, concerns of reasoning prejudice and moral prejudice are lessened.&lt;ref&gt;
R v DeKock, 2009 ABCA 225 (CanLII) at paras 33-37, 43-45&lt;br&gt;
R v TB, 2009 ONCA 177 (CanLII) at paras 26-30, 33&lt;br&gt;
R v Blea, 2012 ABCA 41 (CanLII) at para 48&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Time Consumption===
Prejudice arises from evidence that consumes too much time and resources. The trier-of-fact should not have their time wasted with minor evidence that will waste their time and confuse them from the real issues. 

The time consumption should be commensurate to its value.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 97
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Trial Fairness===
The conduct of the trial, including the admission of evidence, should &quot;not result in the trial being unfair because the accused has been denied a full opportunity to prepare his case, challenge and answer the Crown’s case.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Albright 1987 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1987] 2 S. C. R. 383 at para. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering hearsay tendered by accused the judge may relax the rules of admissibility in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This preferred treatment is due to the liberty interests at stake.&lt;ref&gt;
Paciocco and Stuesser, The Law of Evidence, Sixth Edition, at page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
There are several ways that facts can be established. The predominant manner of establishing fact is through evidence. In fact, almost all manners of proof require some amount of evidence and the real distinction is the proximity of the evidence to the fact at issue.

Facts are established by:
# Direct Evidence
# Circumstantial Evidence (including inferences)
# Legal Presumptions
# Judicial Notice
# Admissions of Fact

===Direct Evidence===
Direct evidence is evidence that is put forward to directly establish a fact which resolves a matter at issue. No inferences of fact need to be drawn to resolve the matter at issue. A first-hand eyewitness testifying to seeing a criminal offence take place is the most obvious example of direct evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Real evidence consists of all tangible evidence, physical objects such as , tape recordings, computer printouts or photographs. Real evidence, as all other evidence, must first be relevant. Secondly, it must be authentic.

''Authentication'' is often proven by having witnesses identify the object and verify its authenticity. The leading case on authentication of real evidence is in ''R. v. Parsons''. The case hinged on a wiretap whose lawfulness was in question. The issue was handled in a voir dire. However, on appeal the Court said that an issue for the trier of fact to determine not the trial judge. The judge must only determine if the evidence has met the minimum statutory requirement.

There is no fixed formula for submitting real evidence, however, it is recommended that a procedure for submitting evidence be followed such as:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evidence: Principles and Problems&quot; by ''Delisle, et al.'' at p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; 
# call a witness with personal knowledge of the object;
# ask the witness to describe the object before showing it to the witness;
# allow the witness to examine and identify it as genuine; and 
# ask that the object be entered as an exhibit, with the appropriate stamp applied by the clerk.

== Demonstrative Evidence ==
Demonstrative evidence includes charts, models, and experiments. They are used as tools to assist the judge in their understanding the of case. They are not &quot;real evidence&quot; is the strictest meaning as they are not objects that form part of the incident.

With demonstrative evidence, there is no need for the formal authentication. Instead, the only standard is that of whether the evidence is relevant and whether it is an accurate representation of what it is supposed to depict. The primary consideration of the court is whether the item can assist the court or whether it warps or distorts the fact-finding process.&lt;ref&gt;Delisle, Stuart, Tanovich, &quot;Evidence: Principles and Problems&quot; 7th Ed. at p. 301&lt;/reF&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Experiments===
Experimental evidence is admissible as demonstrative evidence. 

Where the experimental evidence is relevant and materials it will tend to be admitted, unless the discretionary exclusion rule is applied.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Collins 2001 CanLII 24124 (ON CA), (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 85 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cyr, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfcv 2012 ONCA 919] (CanLII) at para. 119&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the evidence requires inferences using special knowledge, the adducing party will need to admit it as expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts generally are very cautious about allowing demonstrative evidence in the form of in-court experiments as the environment of a court does not allow for a good duplication of the events at issue.&lt;ReF&gt;See R v Howard and Trudel, (1983 3 CCC 3d 399 (ONCA) - Judge refused demo&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes video re-enactment performed by officers.&lt;Ref&gt; R v. MacDonald (2000) 146 CCC 3d 525 (ONCA) - video of police re-enacting struggle denied&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nikitin 2003 176 CCC 3d 225 - video of school bus crossing re-enactment permitted&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, the relevancy and admissibility will depend on the degree of accuracy the recreation is to the original event.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 120&lt;br&gt;
Collins at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nikitin 2003 CanLII 18062 (ON CA), (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in more controlled situations are more likely to be admitted. A ballistics expert who takes a firearm used in an alleged shooting can be permitted to perform tests on the weapon to determine its accuracy.&lt;Ref&gt;Collins&lt;/ref&gt;

Anytime that experiments are admitted before a jury, limiting instructions should be given.&lt;ref&gt;
Cyr at para. 121&lt;br&gt;
Nikitin, at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Views ==
A “view” is where the trier-of-fact, be it judge or jury, is permitted to attend the location of the event at issue in trial to better understand the evidence. The view may be requested by either party or on the judge’s motion under s. 652: 

{{quotation|
View&lt;br&gt;
652. (1) The judge may, where it appears to be in the interests of justice, at any time after the jury has been sworn and before it gives its verdict, direct the jury to have a view of any place, thing or person, and shall give directions respecting the manner in which, and the persons by whom, the place, thing or person shall be shown to the jury, and may for that purpose adjourn the trial.
&lt;P&gt;
Directions to prevent communication&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a view is ordered under subsection (1), the judge shall give any directions that he considers necessary for the purpose of preventing undue communication by any person with members of the jury, but failure to comply with any directions given under this subsection does not affect the validity of the proceedings.
&lt;P&gt;
Who shall attend&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where a view is ordered under subsection (1), the accused and the judge shall attend.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 579.
| [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec652 CCC]}}

The order is made where it “is in the interest of justice”. This requires that the viewing of the location add something to the evidence. While the viewing itself does not amount to evidence, it is intended to be an aid that helps facilitate an understanding of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nasrallah, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqvpf 2012 ONSC 2124]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the view can be taken even after the close of evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Welsh 1997 CanLII 2570 (BCCA), [1997] BCJ No 2343&lt;/ref&gt;

For a detailed review of law, see R. v. Polimac, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q37c 2006 CanLII 40110 (ON SC)]

{{reflist|2}}
== Photographs ==
In order to admit photographic evidence in the Court, the party submitting the evidence must establish that:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Creemer and Cormier, [1968] 1 C.C.C. 14 at 22&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Schaffner, [1988] N.S.J. No. 334&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Murphy, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrt0#par48 2011 NSCA 54 at 48]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* they accurately and truly represent the facts, 
* are fairly presented and without any intent to mislead and 
* are verified on oath by a person capable of doing so. 

The person testifying to the photographs can be:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schaffner, [1988] N.S.J. No. 334&lt;/ref&gt;
* the photographer
* a person present when the photograph was taken
* a person qualified to state that the representation is accurate, or
* an expert witness

The age of a person in a photograph is a question of fact for the trier-of-fact, and does not need an expert.

Police sketches based on eye-witness descriptions will be admissible where the sketch artist is available for cross-examination.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Sophonow (1986) 25 CCC (3d) 415&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Video ==
The requirements for admitting video evidence is the same as those of photos. However, in the case of video tape there is the added danger of potential of tape alterations (editing, slow-motion replay, etc.), so the judge must be even more cautious when admitting video evidence.

As long as the video recording is of sufficient quality, the trier-of-fact can identify the accused without corroborating evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Nikolovski [1996] 3 SCR 1197&lt;br&gt;
R v Leaney (1987) 38 CCC (3d) 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The video footage evidence is considered real evidence and so cannot be said to &quot;hearsay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Video re-enactments===
Courts should be cautious when dealing with video reenactments where the accused is not participating. It may have the tenancy to overly influence the jury.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. MacDonald 2000 CanLII 16799 (ON CA), (2000), 134 O.A.C. 167 at 36&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the admissibility turns on whether the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;at 41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audio ==
Audio recording are to be treated in the same manner as witness testimony, but with the added weight provided that it is a more accurate record of past conversations. The use of private recorded coversations in a criminal trial usually requires a voir dire to be held.

A police officer can give evidence of the accused's natural voice at time arrest to establish voice identification as long as their is no trickery used to induce the accused to speak.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Lepage, [http://canlii.ca/t/1w8mr 2008 BCCA 132]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Documentary evidence is any kind of evidence on which relevant information is printed upon. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daye, [1908] 2 KB 333 at 340&lt;br&gt; 
c.f. Fox v. Sleeman, [1897], O.J. No. 222 (1897),17 P.R. 492 (Ont. H.C.J.), at para 14 per Amour C.J. citing Digest of the Law of Evidence, Sir J.F. Stephen, describing it as &quot;any matter expressed or described upon any substance by means of letters, figures, or marks, or by more than one of these means, intended to be used, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that matter.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

This generally includes paper records, such as court documents, business records, personal papers, etc.

It can also include electronic documents&lt;ref&gt;eg. see s. 30(12) of the CEA[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf5#sec30]&lt;/ref&gt; or materials reducible to writing that is stored on machines, including: &lt;ref&gt;Sopkina, The Law of Evidence in Canada at ss.18.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* tape recordings&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Swartz (1977) 37 CCC 2d 409 at 410 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;
* video tapes
* microfiche &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sanghi (1971) 3 NSR 2d 70 (NSCA) &lt;br&gt;Canada Evidence Act s.31&lt;/ref&gt;
* computer records

Documentary evidence in civil matters governed by provincial legislation have a variety of definitions in different jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure r.30.01(1)(a)&lt;Br&gt;Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Admissibility==
All documents must be authenticated and established as relevant before they can be tendered into evidence. This is done either by oral or affidavit evidence.

The standard used to authenticate the document depends on whether the document is submitted as hearsay (where the contents of the letter helps establish some fact) or as non-hearsay (where the contents of the document is not relevant).

Unless provided by statute, all private documents must be proven to be admissible. It is usually necessary to prove execution before proof of contents.&lt;ReF&gt;R. v. Culpepper (1966) 90 ER 301&lt;/ref&gt; Execution may be proven by inference.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Armstrong (1970) 2 NSR 2d 204&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Non-Hearsay Documents===
Documents that are used for non-hearsay purposes are admitted in the same way real evidence is admitted, which is by calling viva voce evidence of the person who can speak to it’s creation, use and the context of the document. The contents of the document need not be accurate, and where the witness cannot speak to the accuracy of the contents of the document, the contents will have little weight. 

An example where the contents has no bearing is if a party were to attempt to establish that a letter was simply received by a person, which may have relevance to a case concerning actions prompted by the letter, the letter can be put into evidence by calling the person who received the letter and can confirm that it was the letter that they received and speak to the context of its receipt.   By contrast, an example of a non-hearsay document where the contents is attested to as accurate is where a report is being tendered and the authenticating witness is the author of the report.

The document need not be an original, but rather can be authenticated by the witness as a fair and accurate representation of the document received.

{{Reflist|2}}
===Hearsay Documents===
Documents that are submitted for the truth of their contents in lieu of oral evidence must generally be authenticated by someone who can speak with personal knowledge of the contents of the document. This can be direct personal knowledge or circumstantially personal knowledge.

The admissibility of documents for the truth of their contents is governed both by the common law and by statute, such as the Canada Evidence Act. The statutory law on documents compliments the common law, making alternative options for admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Monkhouse, (1988) 61 CR (3d) 343 (Alta CA)&lt;br&gt;
Conley v Conley (1968) 70 DLR (2d) 352 (OntCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is exception to this requirement under s. 29 (financial institution documents) and s. 30 (business records) of the Canada Evidence Act, as well as several other statutory hearsay exceptions.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Best Evidence Rule==
Where the contents of a document are material to the case, the best evidence rule (or &quot;documentary originals rule&quot;) requires that the party submit the original unless the party is unable to do so. The court can accept a secondary copy where it is satisfied that the original was lost, destroyed or otherwise unavailable.&lt;Ref&gt; See R. v. Betterest Vinyl Mfg. Ltd, (1989) 52 CCC 3d 441 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, secondary evidence is admissible where the original was lost or destroyed accidentally or in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Swartz (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 409 (Ont. C.A.) affirmed 1979 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule arises from a time before the advent of computers and photocopiers when all copying was done by hand. It sometimes criticized as a rule that has outlived its purpose.&lt;REf&gt;See R v Donald (1958) 121 CCC 304 at 306 (NBCA)&lt;br&gt; R v Galarce (1983) 35 CR 3d 368 (SKQB)&lt;/ref&gt; There is some suggestion that a lack of original will merely go to weight.&lt;Ref&gt;Garton v Hunter [1969] 1 All ER 451 at 453 per Denning J.&lt;br&gt; see also, R v Cotroni (1977) 37 CCC 2d 409 (ONCA) - audio re-recordings admitted&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the best evidence rule is part of the common law. There are a number of statutory enactments that allow for exemption to this rule, such as CEA s. 29 [financial records], 30(3) [business records], 31(2)(c)[government records] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec29&lt;/ref&gt;.

The rule does not preclude the admission of viva voce evidence of persons who viewed a video that was not in evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Pires, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftswv 2012 ONCJ 713] (CanLII) - police view a surveillance video that was not seizable&lt;Br&gt;
See R. v. Pham, [1999] B.C.J. 2312 (B.C.CA.) at paras. 18 – 25&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. After Dark Enterprises Ltd. 1994 ABCA 360 (CanLII), (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 574 (Alta. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; Kajala v. Noble (1982), 75 Cr. App. R. 149 (Q.B.D.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;



{{Reflist|2}}

==Admissibility of Specific Types of Documents==

Any document can be admitted without proof where the opposing party consents.&lt;Ref&gt;General Host Corp. v. Chemalloy Minerals [1972] 3 OR 142&lt;br&gt;See also s. 655&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec37 s. 37(6.1)] the court has a residual power to&quot;receive into evidence anything that, in the opinion of the court, is reliable and appropriate, even if it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law, and may base its decision on that evidence.&quot;

There are generally three categories of documents:
# public documents
# judicial documents
# private documents

{{Reflist|2}}
===Types of Documents===
* [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Public and Judicial Documents|Public and Judicial Documents]]
* [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Private Documents|Private Documents]]
** [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Business Records|Business Records]]
** [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary Evidence/Financial Institution Records|Financial Institution Records]]

==Electronic Documents==
Electronic documents are governed by [http://canlii.ca/t/hzcp#sec31.1 s.31.1 to 31.8] of the CEA. The provisions are meant to apply &quot;in conjunction with either some common law general rule of admissibility of documents or some other statutory provision&quot;. The section, instead, have the effect of deeming electronically produced documents as &quot;best evidence&quot; (see s.31.1 and 31.2).&lt;ref&gt;
R v Morgan [2002] N.J. No. 15 (QL) (Prov. Ct.) at para 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s. 31.8 of the CEA, &quot;electronic documents&quot; are defined as:
{{quotation|
data that is recorded or stored on any medium in or by a computer system or other similar device and that can be read or perceived by a person or a computer system or other similar device. It includes a display, printout or other output of that data.
}}

===Authentication===
The burden is upon the party tending the electronic document to prove its authenticity. (s.31.1)

The &quot;best evidence rule&quot; can be satisfied by establishing either:
*  &quot;the integrity of the electronic documents system&quot; that generated the document (s. 31.2(1)(a)) which is presumed (s. 31.3, see &quot;presumption of integrity&quot; below).
* in the case of printouts, that the &quot;printout has been manifestly or consistently acted on, relied on or used as a record of the information recorded or stored in the printout&quot; (s. 31.2(2))
* the presumption relating to electronic signatures (see s. 31.4)

'''Presumption of Integrity'''&lt;br&gt;
Under s. 31.3, in &quot;absence of evidence to the contrary&quot;, the integrity of electronic documents are presumed where the is evidence of ''at least one'' of the following:
# &quot;that at all material times the computer system or other similar device used by the electronic documents system was operating properly&quot;;
# if the device was not operating properly at all material times, that the malfunction &quot;did not affect the integrity of the electronic document and there are no other reasonable grounds to doubt the integrity of the electronic documents system&quot;.
# that &quot;the electronic document was recorded or stored by a party who is adverse in interest to the party seeking to introduce it&quot;; ''or''
# the document &quot;was recorded or stored in the usual and ordinary course of business by a person who is not a party and who did not record or store it under the control of the party seeking to introduce it.&quot;

===Admissibility===
Once a computer record is authenticated, the records will usually be admissible under one of the following methods of admissibility for the truth of their contents:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. C.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/frn13 2012 ABPC 139] (CanLII) - review methods of admitting electronic documents, re phone records&lt;/ref&gt;
* CEA business records, 
* CEA financial records,
* common law business documents,
* principled exception to hearsay, or 
* real evidence&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. McCulloch, [1992] B.C.J. No. 2282 (B.C.P.C.) at para. 18 regarding real evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

Where compilation was carried out by automated means, it may be possible to admit them through the common law business record method.&lt;ref&gt;
Eg. R v Sunila, (1986) 26 CCC (3d) 331 (NSSC)&lt;br&gt;
R v Rideout (1996) [1996] NJ No 341&lt;br&gt;
R v Moisan (1999) 141 CCC (3d) 213&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Monkhouse, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that is &quot;automatically recorded by any means, other than by human labour, and the evidence so recorded can be reproduced in any form, intelligible to the human mind, the reproduction is admissible as real evidence.&quot; However, &quot;The weight to be attached to such evidence will depend on the accuracy and integrity of the process employed.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;McCulloch at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

See also: R. v. Nardi, [http://canlii.ca/t/fspw2 2012 BCPC 318] (CanLII)
{{reflist|2}}

==Misc Issues==

===Summaries of Voluminous Documents===
Summaries of voluminous raw documents can be admissible for the purpose of assisting the trier-of-fact in understanding &quot;the entire picture represented by voluminous documentary evidence&quot; as long as source documents are also admitted. &quot;The usefulness of the summaries depended entirely ... upon the acceptance ... the facts upon which the summaries were based.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Scheel, [1978] O.J. No. 888 (ONCA) at para. 13&lt;br&gt;
McDaniel vs. U.S., (1965), 343 F. 2d 785 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, spreadsheets of banking records that have not been admitted have been found acceptable where the tables can be authenticated as an accurate summary of the records it represents. The witness need not be the author of the spreadsheet or the source records.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Agyei, [http://canlii.ca/t/1t6ws 2007 ONCJ 459] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to this principle from Schell, summaries can be admitted without admitting the source documents
under the [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Hearsay/Traditional Exceptions#Voluminous Document Exception|Voluminous Document Hearsay Exception]].

{{reflist|2}}

===Documents Found in Possession of Accused===
Documents that are found in actual or constructive possession of the accused can be used to draw the inference that he has knowledge of the contents of the documents and has a state of mind about any transaction contemplated by it. However, where the document has been recognized, adopted or acted upon by the accused, the documents can be admitted for the truth of their contents.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wood, [http://canlii.ca/t/4v70 2001 NSCA 38]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Signatures===
A signature is evidence suggesting the authorship of a document or knowledge and consent to the contents of it.

Where a party disputes the authenticity or identity of a signature, the signature can be proven by comparison &quot;with any writing proved [...] to be genuine&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;s. 8 of the CEA [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec8]&lt;br&gt;
e.g. R v Abdi (1997) 11 CR 5th 197 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Forged Documents===
Proving forged signature on documents will require an expert of handwriting analysis to determine the probability of matching the accused's signature and the document.&lt;Ref&gt;eg. R. v. Rockwood, 2004 NLSCTD 66&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Errors in Documents===

'''Certificates of analysis'''&lt;br&gt;
Errors and ambiguity in certificates of analysis in which there was a typographical error is not fatal to the case where it can be mended by way of viva voce evidence and where “the error was not of such a nature as to have misled the accused or to interfere with his right to make full answer and defense and receive a fair trial”.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ryden 1993 ABCA 356 (CanLII), (1994) 86 C.C.C. (3d) 57 p62 (error in name)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bykowski 1980 ABCA 220 (error in date)&lt;br&gt;
R. v Smith, 2012 ABPC 14 (error in addressee of certificate)&lt;br&gt;
R. v Thorburn (1997), 36 W.C.B.(2d) 41, (Alta.Prov.Ct.) certificate stating time as “504” instead of “5:04”  can be cured by testimony of the police officer&lt;Br&gt;
R v Crandall (1998) 195 N.B.R.(2d) 210 -- “0358 hours” interpreted to mean 3:58 a.m., no prejudice to accused
c.f. R. v. Gosby(1974) 16 CCC (2d) 228 NS CA (error in signifant substance)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Inadmissible Documents===
Section [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf5#sec30 30(10)] sets out several types of records which are inadmissible despite any other provision of the evidence act:
* records &quot;made in the course of an investigation or inquiry&quot;
* records &quot;made in the course of obtaining or giving legal advice or in contemplation of a legal proceeding,&quot;
* privileged records 
* &quot;a record of or alluding to a statement made by a person who is not, or if he were living and of sound mind would not be, competent and compellable to disclose in the legal proceeding a matter disclosed in the record;&quot;
* &quot;any record the production of which would be contrary to public policy&quot;
* &quot;any transcript or recording of evidence taken in the course of another legal proceeding.&quot;

==Foreign Documents==
The admissibility of foreign documents is governed by section 36 of the [http://canlii.ca/t/7vbx Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act], RSC 1985, c 30 (4th Supp) (MLAC).

Testimonial evidence, also known as ''viva voce'' evidence or oral testimony, is evidence given by a witness in the form answers to posed questions.

===Purpose of Testimonial Evidence===
Testimonial evidence is the best way to ensure the most reliable and credible evidence is available for the trier of fact to consider.

Witnesses are encouraged to be honest, accurate, and complete by requiring them to give evidence under the requirements that:&lt;ref&gt; R v Baldree [http://canlii.ca/t/fqcws 2012 ONCA 138] at 44&lt;/ref&gt;
# the witness give an oath or affirmation to their evidence;
# their personal presence is necessary;
# they will be subject to cross examination

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Character evidence is evidence that invites the trier of fact to make an inference that the person is of a certain &quot;type&quot;, thus inferring that the person acted consistently with that type of character.  Character evidence can often become prejudicial to the accused and so must be taken with care.

==Character of Victim==
The accused is generally permitted to introduce evidence of the deceased's victim's prior record as well as transcripts of the a related proceedings to establish a propensity for violence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Patterson, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mh7z 2006 CanLII 2609] (ON CA)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Hearsay evidence is any statement, either written or oral, which was made out of court, but is presented in court to prove the truth of that statement.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Evans, 1993 CanLII 86 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653; [1993] S.C.J. No. 115 at para 16 (&quot;An out-of-court statement which is admitted for the truth of its contents is hearsay.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of evidence that is generally considered inadmissible.

The hearsay rule has stated as:&lt;ref&gt;Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, Butterworths, 2d ed. ss.6.2&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Written or oral statements, or communicative conduct made by persons otherwise than in testimony at the proceeding in which it is offered, are inadmissible, if such statements or conduct are tendered either as proof of their truth or as proof of assertions implicit therein.}}

The definition has been addressed in several cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653; R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; R. v. Hawkins, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043 at 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts generally do not allow such evidence as it is generally said to be untrustworthy for several reasons:&lt;Ref&gt;Spokina, supra, at 175&lt;/ref&gt;
#The admission of such evidence lends itself to the perpetration of fraud. This is in part due to the lack of oath on the part of the source. 
#Hearsay evidence results in a decision based upon secondary and, therefore, weaker evidence, rather than the best evidence available. Related to this, there is no opportunity to cross-examine or otherwise test the evidence of the source.&lt;ref&gt; R v Abel [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlsctd/doc/2011/2011nltd173/2011nltd173.html 2011 NLTD 173]
&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is no opportunity to observe the demeanour of the declarant, thus making it harder to assess the quality of the evidence.
#The introduction of such evidence will lengthen trials.



{{reflist|2}}

==Elements of Hearsay==
Where hearsay potentially arises there are four elements to consider if the rule is engaged:&lt;reF&gt; R v Baldree 2012 ONCA 138 at 46&lt;/ref&gt;
# a declarant
# a recipient
# a statement and 
# a purpose for introducing the statement

The first three are almost always made out, the fourth requirement is usually the source of controversy. Not every out of court statement is hearsay.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibited purpose consists of admission for the purpose of proving the “truth” of its contents. Otherwise, it is admissible evidence. That is, statements that used to show the recipient had notice, knowledge or motive, or was in some way probative, then it is otherwise admissible.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Evans, 1993 CanLII 86 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653 at para. 16(&quot;An out-of-court statement offered simply as proof that the statement was made is not hearsay, and is admissible as long as it has some probative value&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is for the “truth of its contents” then it is presumptively inadmissible unless it fits in a traditional categorical exception or under the principled exception.&lt;ref&gt;R v Khelawon at 42&lt;/reF&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Application of Hearsay Rules ==

=== Computer Records ===

The absence of data in a computer system is not generally hearsay. For example, enquiries into the police records regarding a suspect that result in a negative result was found not to be hearsay.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Saddleback, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxnv 2012 ABQB 670] (CanLII) at para. 45-54&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
=== Opinion Evidence===
Non-specific hearsay opinion evidence is inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Ranger 2003 CanLII 32900 (ON CA), (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 1, 14 C.R. (6th) 324 (C.A.) at para. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Phone Calls===
Drug purchase phone calls, usually where the police are on the other end of a call, have a history of litigation to exclude them as hearsay. More often than not they have been admitted as either necessary and reliable or as non-hearsay.&lt;ref&gt;
As non-hearsay see R v Lucia, [http://canlii.ca/t/2br2d#par7 2010 ONCA 533 at para. 7]&lt;br&gt;
R v Edwards,[http://canlii.ca/t/6k30 1994 CanLII 1461 (ON CA)] at pp. 248-249&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nguyen 2003 BCCA 556 (CanLII), (2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 347 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 17&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ly, 1997 CanLII 330 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698, at para. 3&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cook (1978), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 318 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 320&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Duncan, [http://canlii.ca/t/1f81b 2001 CanLII 11779] (MB PC) - phone-call inadmissible&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bjornson, [http://canlii.ca/t/27522 2009 BCSC 1779] (CanLII) - admissible &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Guan, [http://canlii.ca/t/2blxm 2010 YKSC 14] (CanLII) - admissible b/c not hearsay&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Mironuk-Hurak, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftr6l 2012 MBQB 290] - admissible b/c not hearsay(CanLII)

When a witness is put on a stand their primary role is to recall their knowledge of some past event at issue in the case. As a general rule no witnesses are allowed to give any opinion. However, in practice, the line between fact and opinion can never be clearly drawn, so often exceptions will be made. Opinion, in certain cases, can even be useful to the trier of fact in coming to their conclusions. Experts are generally allowed to give their opinion in matters within their expert knowledge that the trier cannot easily deduce themselves. To address these situations the law of opinion is divided into two area: lay opinion and expert opinion.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
{{Quote|The beautiful thing about learning is nobody can take it away from you.|[[w:B.B. King|B.B. King]] (5 October 1997)}}
Learning a computer programming language is like a toddler's first steps. You stumble, and fall, but when you start walking, programming becomes second nature. And once you start programming, you never cease evolving or picking up new tricks. Learn one programming language, and you will &quot;know&quot; them all &amp;mdash; the logic of the world will begin to unravel around you.

==Are you new to programming?==
[[File:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|300px|This stunning image of the sunset on planet Mars wouldn't have been possible without Java.]]

If you have chosen Java as your first programming language, be assured that Java is also the first choice for computer science programs in many universities. Its simple and intuitive [[wikt:syntax|syntax]], or grammar, helps beginners feel at ease with complex programming constructs quickly.

However, Java is not a ''basic'' programming language. In fact, NASA used Java as the driving force (quite literally) behind its Mars Rover missions. Robots, air traffic control systems and the self-checkout barcode scanners in your favorite supermarkets can all be programmed in Java.

==Programming with Java&amp;trade;==

By now, you might truly be able to grasp the power of the Java programming language. With Java, there are many possibilities. Yet not every programmer gets to program applications that take unmanned vehicles onto other planets. Software that we encounter in our daily life is somewhat humble in that respect. Software in Java, however, covers a vast area of the computing ecosphere. Here are just a few examples of the ubiquitous nature of Java applications in real-life:

* [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]], a desktop office management suite that rivals the Microsoft Office suite has been written in Java.
* The popular building game [[w:Minecraft|Minecraft]] is written in Java.
* Online browser-based games like [[w:Runescape|Runescape]], a 3D massively multi-player online role playing game (MMORPG), run on graphics routines, 3D rendering and networking capabilities powered by the Java programming language.
* Two of the world's renowned digital video recorders, [[w:TiVo|TiVo]] and BSkyB's [[w:Sky+|Sky+]] use built-in live television recording software to record, rewind and play your favorite television shows. These applications make extensive use of the Java programming language.

The above mentioned applications illustrate the reach and ubiquity of Java applications. Here's another fact: almost 80% of mobile phone vendors adopt Java as their primary platform for the development of applications. The most widely used mobile-based operating system, [[w:Android (operating system)|Android]], uses Java as one of its key application platforms &amp;mdash; developers are encouraged to develop applications for Android in the Java programming language.

==What can Java ''not'' do?==
Well, to be honest, there is nothing that Java can't do, at least for application programming. Java is a &quot;complete&quot; language; the only limits are programmer imagination and ability. This book aims to get you acquainted with the basics of the language so you can create the software masterpiece of your dreams. The one area where Java can't be used is for direct interaction with computer hardware. If you want to write an operating system, you will need to look elsewhere!

=== How to use ===
This navigation template appears wherever the tag {{tl|Guide to Unix}} is placed on a wiki page. The intention is to put this at the top of each page linked from it. This alerts readers that the page is part of a larger book, and provides links.

The template looks like:
{{Guide to Unix}}

=== How it works ===
The text is centered. The CSS for a green background is attached to the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. The top line (with the book title and &quot;Edit template&quot;) line is made possible with a table using the wiki table syntax. The table has full 100% width; the left, center, and right cells are 20%, 60%, and 20% width and have left, center, and right text alignments.

For more information on CSS and wiki table syntax, try looking in [[meta:Help:Editor]] in the MediaWiki Handbook.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Now, that we have the Java platform on our systems and have run the first program successfully, we are geared towards understanding how programs are actually made. As we have already discussed, a program is a set of instructions, which are tasks provided to a computer. These instructions are called '''statements''' in Java. Statements can be anything from a single line of code to a complex mathematical equation. Consider the following line:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.1: A simple assignment statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age = 24;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This line is a simple instruction that tells the system to initialize a variable and set its value as 24. If the above statement was the only one in the program, it would look similar to this:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.1: A statement in a simple class.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class MyProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 24;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Java places its statements within a class declaration and, in the class declaration, the statements are usually placed in the method declaration, as above.

== Variable declaration statement ==
The simplest statement is a variable declaration:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.2: A simple declaration statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int age;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

It defines a variable that can be used to store values for later use. The first token is the [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|data type]] of the variable (which type of values this variable can store). The second token is the name of the variable, by which you will be referring to it. Then each declaration statement is ended by a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

==Assignment statements==
Up until now, we've assumed the creation of variables as a single statement. In essence, we assign a value to those variables, and that's just what it is called. When you assign a value to a variable in a statement, that statement is called an '''assignment statement''' (also called an [[w:Initialization (programming)|initialization statement]]). Did you notice one more thing? It's the semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;), which is at the end of each statement. A clear indicator that a line of code is a statement is its termination with an ending semicolon. If one was to write multiple statements, it is usually done on each separate line ending with a semicolon. Consider the example below:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;section-3&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.3: Multiple assignment statements.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = 30;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You do not necessarily have to use a new line to write each statement. Just like English, you can begin writing the next statement where you ended the first one as depicted below:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.4: Multiple assignment statements on the same line.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int a = 10; int b = 20; int c = 30;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

However, the only problem with putting multiple statements on one line is, it's very difficult to read it. It doesn't look that intimidating at first, but once you've got a significant amount of code, it's usually better to organize it in a way that makes sense. It would look more complex and incomprehensible written as it is in Listing 3.4.

Now that we have looked into the anatomy of a simple assignment statement, we can look back at what we've achieved. We know that...
* A statement is a unit of code in programming.
* If we are assigning a variable a value, the statement is called an assignment statement.
* An assignment statement includes three parts: a data type, the variable name (also called the identifier) and the value of a variable. We will look more into the nature of identifiers and values in the section ''[[Java Programming/Variables|Variables]]'' later.

Now, before we move on to the next topic, you need to try and understand what the code below does.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.5: Multiple assignment statements with expressions.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int firstNumber = 10;
int secondNumber = 20;
int result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
secondNumber = 30;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The first two statements are pretty much similar to those in [[#section-3|Section 3.3]] but with different variable names. The third however is a bit interesting. We've already talked of variables as being similar to gift boxes. Think of your computer's memory as a shelf where you put all those boxes. Whenever you need a box (or variable), you call its identifier (that's the name of the variable). So calling the variable identifier &lt;code&gt;firstNumber&lt;/code&gt; gives you the number &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, calling &lt;code&gt;secondNumber&lt;/code&gt; would give you &lt;code&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; hence when you add the two up, the answer should be &lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt;. That's what the value of the last variable &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; would be. The part of the third statement where you add the numbers, i.e., &lt;code&gt;firstNumber + secondNumber&lt;/code&gt; is called an '''expression''' and the expression is what decides what the value is to be. If it's just a plain value, like in the first two statements, then it's called a '''literal''' (the value is ''literally'' the value, hence the name ''literal'').

Note that after the assignment to &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; its value will not be changed if we assign different values to &lt;code&gt;firstNumber&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;secondNumber&lt;/code&gt;, like in line 4.

With the information you have just attained, you can actually write a decent Java program that can sum up values.

== Assertion ==
An assertion checks if a condition is true:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.6: A return statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    public int getAge() {
        assert age &gt;= 0;
        return age;
    }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Each &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;). However, assertions are disabled by default, so you must run the program with the ''-ea'' argument in order for assertions to be enabled (&lt;code&gt;java -ea [name of compiled program]&lt;/code&gt;).

== Program Control Flow ==
Statements are evaluated in the order as they occur. The execution of flow begins at the top most statement and proceed downwards till the last statement is encountered. A statement can be substituted by a statement block. There are special statements that can redirect the execution flow based on a condition, those statements are called ''branching'' statements, described in detail in a later section.

== Statement Blocks ==
A bunch of statements can be placed in braces to be executed as a single block. Such a block of statement can be named
or be provided a condition for execution. Below is how you'd place a series of statements in a block.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.7: A statement block.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int result = a + b;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Branching Statements ==
Program flow can be affected using function/method calls, loops and iterations. Of various types of branching constructs,
we can easily pick out two generic branching methods.

* Unconditional Branching
* Conditional Branching

=== Unconditional Branching Statements ===
If you look closely at a method, you'll see that a method is a named statement block that is executed by calling that particular name. An unconditional branch is created either by invoking the method or by calling &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt;, all of which are described below.

When a name of a method is encountered in a flow, it stops execution in the current method and branches to the newly called method. After returning a value from the called method, execution picks up at the original method on the line below the method call.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-8&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.8: UnconditionalBranching.java'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
public class UnconditionalBranching {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Inside main method! Invoking aMethod!&quot;);
        aMethod();
        System.out.println(&quot;Back in main method!&quot;);
    }

    public static void aMethod() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Inside aMethod!&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output provided with the screen of information running the above code.
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Inside main method! Invoking aMethod!
Inside aMethod!
Back in main method!
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The program flow begins in the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; method. Just as &lt;code&gt;aMethod&lt;/code&gt; is invoked, the flow travels to
the called method. At this very point, the flow branches to the other method. Once the method is completed, the flow
is returned to the point it left off and resumes at the next statement after the call to the method.

== Return statement ==
A &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement exits from a block, so it is often the last statement of a method:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.9: A return statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
    public int getAge() {
        int age = 24;
        return age;
    }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

A return statement can return the content of a variable or nothing. Beware not to write statements after a return statement which would not be executed! Each &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Conditional Branching Statements ===
Conditional branching is attained with the help of the &lt;code&gt;if...else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements. A
conditional branch occurs only if a certain condition expression evaluates to true.

====Conditional Statements====

Also referred to as ''{{java:if}} statements'', these allow a program to perform a test and then take action based on the result of that test.

The form of the {{java:if}} statement:

 {{java:if}} (''condition'') {
   ''do statements here if condition is true''
 } {{java:else}} {
   ''do statements here if condition is false''
 }

The ''condition'' is a boolean expression which can be either {{java:true}} or {{java:false}}. The actions performed will depend on the value of the condition.

Example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.10: An if statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (i &gt; 0) {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored in i is greater than zero&quot;);
} else {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored is not greater than zero&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If statements can also be made more complex using the else if combination:

 {{java:if}} (''condition 1'') {
    ''do statements here if condition 1 is true''
 } {{java:else}} {{java:if}} (''condition 2'') {
    ''do statements here if condition 1 is false and condition 2 is true''
 } {{java:else}} {
   ''do statements here if neither condition 1 nor condition 2 is true''
 }

Example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.11: An if/else if/else statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (i &gt; 0) {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored in i is greater than zero&quot;);
} else if (i &lt; 0) {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored in i is less than zero&quot;);
} else {
   System.out.println(&quot;value stored is equal to 0&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If there is only one statement to be executed after the condition, as in the above example, it is possible to omit the curly braces, however Oracle's [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html#449 Java Code Conventions] explicitly state that the braces should always be used.

There is no looping involved in an if statement so once the condition has been evaluated the program will continue with the next instruction after the statement.

==== If...else statements ====

The {{Java:if}} ... {{Java:else}} statement is used to conditionally execute one of two blocks of
statements, depending on the result of a boolean condition.

Example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.12: An if/else statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (list == null) {
  // This block of statements executes if the condition is true.
} else {
  // This block of statements executes if the condition is false.
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Oracle's [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html#449 Java Code Conventions] recommend that the braces should always be used.

An {{Java:if}} statement has two forms:

 {{Java:if}} (boolean-condition)
    {{Java:statement1}}

and

 {{Java:if}} (boolean-condition)
    {{Java:statement1}}
 {{Java:else}}
    {{Java:statement2}}

Use the second form if you have different statements to execute if the {{Java:boolean-condition}} is true or if it is false. Use the first if you only wish to execute {{Java:statement1}} if the condition is true and you do not wish to execute alternate statements if the condition is false.

The [[#code-section-13|code section 3.13]] calls two {{Java:int}} methods, &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y()&lt;/code&gt;, stores the results, then uses an {{Java:if}} statement to test if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is less than y and if it is, the {{Java:statement1}} body will swap the values. The end result is x always contains the larger result and y always contains the smaller result.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-13&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.13: Value swap.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int x = f();
int y = y();
if (x &lt; y) {
  int z = x;
  x = y;
  y = z;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{{Java:if}}...{{Java:else}} statements also allow for the use of another statement, {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}}.  This statement is used to provide another {{Java:if}} statement to the conditional that can only be executed if the others are not true.  For example:

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.14: Multiple branching.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (x == 2)
  x = 4;
else if (x == 3)
  x = 6;
else
  x = -1;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}} statement is useful in this case because if one of the conditionals is true, the other must be false.  Keep in mind that if one is true, the other ''will not'' execute.  For example, if the statement at line 2 contained in the first conditional were changed to &lt;code&gt;x = 3;&lt;/code&gt;, the second conditional, the {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}}, would still not execute.  However, when dealing with primitive types in conditional statements, it is more desirable to use &lt;code&gt;[[Java_Programming/Statements#Switch_statements|switch statements]]&lt;/code&gt; rather than multiple {{Java:else}} {{Java:if}} statements.

==== Switch statements ====
The {{Java:switch}} conditional statement is basically a shorthand version of writing many {{Java:if}}...{{Java:else}} statements.  The syntax for {{Java:switch}} statements is as follows:
 {{Java:switch}}(&lt;variable&gt;) {
   case &lt;result&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;; break;
   case &lt;result&gt;: &lt;statements&gt;; break;
   default: &lt;statements&gt;; break;
 }
This means that if the variable included equals one of the case results, the statements following that case, until the word &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; will run.  The &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; case executes if none of the others are true.  '''Note:''' the only types that can be analysed through {{Java:switch}} statements are {{java:char}}, {{java:byte}}, {{java:short}}, or {{java:int}} primitive types.  This means that {{Java:Object}} variables can not by analyzed through {{Java:switch}} statements. However, as of the JDK 7 release, you can use a String object in the expression of a switch statement.

{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.15: A switch.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int n = 2, x;
switch (n) {
  case 1: x = 2;
    break;
  case 2: x = 4;
    break;
  case 3: x = 6;
    break;
  case 4: x = 8;
    break;
}
return x;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In this example, since the integer variable &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 2, &lt;code&gt;case 2&lt;/code&gt; will execute, make &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; equal to 4.  Thus, 4 is returned by the method.

== Iteration Statements ==
Iteration Statements are statements that are used to iterate a block of statements. Such statements are often referred
to as loops. Java offers four kinds of iterative statements.

* The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop
* The &lt;code&gt;do...while&lt;/code&gt; loop
* The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop
* The &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop

=== The while loop ===
{{main|Java Programming/Keywords/while}}
The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop iterates a block of code while the condition it specifies is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

The syntax for the loop is:

 {{java:while}} (condition) {
    statement;
  }

Here the condition is an expression.
An expression as discussed earlier is any statement that returns a value. &lt;code&gt;While&lt;/code&gt; condition statements
evaluate to a boolean value, that is, either &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. As long as the condition is
&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the loop will iterate the block of code over and over and again. Once the condition evaluates
to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, the loop exits to the next statement outside the loop.

=== The do...while loop ===
The do-while loop is functionally similar to the while loop, except the condition is evaluated AFTER the statement executes
 {{java:do}} {
    statement;
  } {{java:while}} (condition);

=== The for loop ===
{{Main|Java Programming/Keywords/for}}
The for loop is a specialized while loop whose syntax is designed for easy iteration through a sequence of numbers. Example:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-16&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.16: A for loop.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
  System.out.println(i + &quot;\t&quot; + i * i);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for [[#code-listing-16|code listing 3.16]] if you compile and run the statement above.'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
 0      0
 1      1
 2      4
 3      9
 ...
 99     9801
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}
The program prints the numbers 0 to 99 and their squares.

The same statement in a while loop:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.17: An alternative version.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 100) {
   System.out.println(i + &quot;\t&quot; + i * i);
   i++;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

=== The foreach loop ===
The foreach statement allows you to iterate through all the items in a collection,
examining each item in turn while still preserving its type. The syntax for the foreach statement is:

 {{java:for}} (''type'' item : collection) statement;

For an example, we'll take an array of &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;s denoting days in a week and traverse through the
collection, examining one item at a time.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-18&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.18: A foreach loop.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String[] days = {&quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot;};

for (String day : days) {
  System.out.println(day);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for [[#code-listing-18|code listing 3.18]]'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

Notice that the loop automatically exits after the last item in the collection has been examined in the statement
block.

Although the enhanced for loop can make code much clearer, it can't be used in some common situations.

* '''Only access.''' Elements can not be assigned to, eg, not to increment each element in a collection.
* '''Only single structure.''' It's not possible to traverse two structures at once, eg, to compare two arrays.
* '''Only single element.''' Use only for single element access, eg, not to compare successive elements.
* '''Only forward.''' It's possible to iterate only forward by single steps.
* '''At least Java 5.''' Don't use it if you need compatibility with versions before Java 5.

== The continue and break statements ==
At times, you would like to re-iterate a loop without executing the remaining statement within the loop. The
&lt;code&gt;{{java:continue}}&lt;/code&gt; statement causes the loop to re-iterate and start over from the top most statement inside
the loop.

Where there is an ability to re-iterate the loop, there is an ability to exit the loop when required. At any given
moment, if you'd like to exit a loop and end all further work within the loop, the &lt;code&gt;{{java:break}}&lt;/code&gt; ought to be
used.

The &lt;code&gt;{{java:continue}}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{{java:break}}&lt;/code&gt; statements can be used with a label like follows:

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-19&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.19: Using a label.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
String s = &quot;A test string for the switch!\nLine two of test string...&quot;;
outer: for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++) {
  switch (s.charAt(i)) {
    case '\n': break outer;
    case ' ': break;
    default: System.out.print(s.charAt(i));
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for [[#code-listing-19|code listing 3.19]]'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
 Ateststringfortheswitch!
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

== Throw statement ==
A &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement exit from a method and so on and so on or it is caught by a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block. It does not return a variable but an exception:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.20: A return statement.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    public int getAge() {
        throw new NullPointerException();
    }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Beware not to write statements after a &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement which would not be executed too! Each &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; statement is ended by a semi-colon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;).

== try/catch ==
A &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; must at least contain the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block and the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block:
{{XExample|1='''Code section 3.21: try/catch block.'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
try {
  // Some code
} catch (Exception e) {
  // Optional exception handling
} finally {
  // This code is executed no matter what
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

There are various ways in which Java code can be executed.  A complex Java application usually uses third party APIs or services. In this section we list the most popular ways a piece of Java code may be packed together and/or executed.

== JSE code execution ==
Java language first edition came out in the client-server era.  Thick clients were developed with rich GUI interfaces. Java first edition, JSE (Java Standard Edition) had/has the following in its belt:
* GUI capabilities (AWT, Swing)
* Network computing capabilities ([[w:Java remote method invocation|RMI]])
* Multi-tasking capabilities (Threads)
With JSE the following Java code executions are possible:
[[Image:java_stand_alone_appl.jpg|thumb|200px|Figure 1: Stand alone execution]]
 
; Stand alone Java application : (Figure 1) Stand alone application refers to a Java program where both the user interface and business modules are running on the same computer.  The application may or may not use a database to persist data. The user interface could be either AWT or Swing.
:The application would start with a &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method of a Class.  The application stops when the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method exits, or if an exception is thrown from the application to the JVM. Classes are loaded to memory and compiled as needed, either from the file system or from a *.jar file, by the JVM.  
: Invocation of Java programs distributed in this manner requires usage of the command line.  Once the user has all the class files, he needs to launch the application by the following command line (where Main is the name of the class containing the main() method.)
{{XCode|1='''Execution of class'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
java Main
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

; Java 'jar' class libraries : Utility classes, framework classes, and/or third party classes are usually packaged and distributed in Java ' *.jar' files.  These 'jar' files need to be put in the CLASSPATH of the java program from  which these classes are going to be used.
: If a jar file is executable, it can be run from the command line:
{{XCode|1='''Execution of archive'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
java -jar Application.jar
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

[[Image:Java applet appl.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Applet Execution]]

; Java Applet code : (Figure 2) Java Applets are Java code referenced from [[w:HTML|HTML]] pages, by the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag. The Java code is downloaded from a server and runs in the client browser JVM. Java has built-in support to render applets in the browser window.
:Sophisticated GUI clients were found hard to develop, mostly because of download time, incompatibilities between browser JVM implementations, and communication requirements back to the server. Applets are rarely used today, and are most commonly used as small, separate graphic-like animation applets. The popularity of Java declined when Microsoft withdrew its Java support from [[w:Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer]] default configuration, however, the plugin is still available as a free download from [http://java.com/ java.com].&lt;!-- N.b. this paragraph still has a POV issue, as if you're promoting Adobe Flash - that doesn't have an plugin by default either. --&gt;
:More information can be found about applets at the [[Java Programming/Applets|Applet Chapter]], in this book. Also, Wikipedia has an article about [[w:Java applet|Java Applets]].

; Client Server applications : The client server applications consist of a front-end, and a back-end part, both running on a separate computer. The idea is that the business logic would be on the back-end part of the program, which would be reused by all the clients. Here the challenge is to achieve a separation between front-end user interface code, and the back-end business logic code.
: The communication between the front-end and the back-end can be achieved by two ways.
::* One way is to define a data communication [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]] between the two tiers. The back-end part would listen for an incoming request. Based on the [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]] it interprets the request and sends back the result in data form.
::* The other way is to use [[w:Java remote method invocation|Java Remote Invocation]] (RMI). With the use of RMI, a remote object can be created and used by the client.  In this case Java objects are transmitted across the network.
: More information can be found about client-server programming, with sample code, at the [[Java Programming/Client Server|Client Server Chapter]] in this book.

; Web Applications : For applications needed by lots of client installations, the client-server model did not work. Maintaining and upgrading the hundreds or thousands of clients caused a problem. It was not practical. The solution to this problem was to create a unified, standard client, for all applications, and that is the ''[[w:Web browser|Browser]]''.
:Having a standard client, it makes sense to create a unified, standard back-end service as well, and that is the ''[[w:Application server|Application Server]]''.  
:'''Web Application''' is an application that is running in the [[w:Application server|Application Server]], and it can be accessed and used by the [[w:Web browser|Browser]] client.
:There are three main area of interest in Web Applications, those are:
:* The [[w:Web Browser|Web Browser]]. This is the container of rendering HTML text, and running client scripts
:* The [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[w:Protocol (computing)|protocol]]. Text data are sent back and forth between Browser and the Server
:* The [[w:Web server|Web server]] to serve static content, [[w:Application server|Application server]] to serve dynamic content and host [[w:Enterprise JavaBean|EJB]]s.
:Wikipedia also has an article about [[w:Web application|Web application]].

== J2EE code execution  ==
As the focus was shifting from reaching GUI clients to thin client applications, with Java version 2, Sun introduced J2EE (Java 2 Extended Edition). J2EE added :
* [[w:Software componentry|Components Base Architecture]], (Servlet, JSP, EJB Containers)
With J2EE the following Java component executions are possible:

[[Image:Java servlet appl.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 3: Servlet Execution]]

; Java Servlet code : (Figure 3) Java got its popularity with server side programming, more specifically with [[w:Java EE|J2EE]] servlets. Servlets are running in a simple J2EE framework to handle client [[w:Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] requests. They are meant to replace [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGI programming]] for web pages rendering dynamic content.
: The servlet is running in a so called [[w:Web container|servlet-container/web container]]. The servlet's responsibility is to:
:* Handle the request by doing the business logic computation,
:* Connecting to a database if needed,
:* Create HTML to present to the user through the browser
:The HTML output represents both the presention logic and the results of the business computations.  This represents a huge problem, and there is no real application relying only on servlets to handle the presention part of the responsibility. There are two main solutions to this:
:* Use a template tool (Store the presentation part in an HTML file, marking the areas that need to be replaced after business logic computations).
:* Use JSP (See next section)
:Wikipedia also has an article about [[w:Java Servlet|Servlets]].

[[Image:Java jsp appl.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 4: Jsp Execution]]
; Java Server Pages (JSP) code : (Figure 4) JSP is an HTML file with embedded Java code inside.  The first time the JSP is accessed, the JSP is converted to a Java Servlet. This servlet outputs HTML which has inside the result of the business logic computation. There are special JSP tags that helps to add data dynamically to the HTML. Also JSP technology allows to create custom tags.
:Using the JSP technology correctly, business logic computations should not be in the embedded Java part of the JSP. JSP should be used to render the presentation of the static and dynamic data. Depending on the complexity of the data, 100% separation is not easy to achieve. Using custom tags, however may help to get closer to 100%. This is advocated also in [[w:Model-view-controller|MVC]] architecture (see below).

[[Image:Java ejb appl.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 5: EJB Execution]]
; EJB code : (Figure 5) In the 1990s, with the client server computing, a trend started, that is to move away from Mainframe computing. That resulted in many small separate applications in a Company/Enterprise. Many times the same data was used in different applications. A new philosophy, &quot;Enterprise Computing&quot;, was created to address these issues.  The idea was to create components that can be reused throughout the Enterprise. The Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) were supposed to address this.  
: An '''EJB''' is an application component that runs in an EJB container. The client accesses the EJB modules through the container, never directly.  The container manages the life cycle of the EJB modules, and handles all the issues that arise from network/enterpise computing. Some of those are [[w:Access control|security/access control]], [[w:Object pool|object pooling]], [[w:Transaction processing|transaction management]], ... .
:EJBs have the same problems as any reusable code: they need to be generic enough to be able to be reused and the changes or maintenance of EJBs can affect existing clients. Many times EJBs are used unnecessarily when they are not really needed. An EJB should be designed as a separate application in the enterprise, fulfilling one function.


[[Image:Java mvc appl.gif|thumb|350px|Figure 6: MVC Execution]]
; Combine J2EE components to create an MVC architecture : This leads us to the three layers/tiers as shown in (Figure 6).
: In modern web applications, with lots of static data and nice graphics, how the data is presented to the user became very important and usually needs the help of a graphic artist.
: To help programmers and graphic artists to work together, the separation between data, code, and how it is presented became crucial.
:
:* The '''view''' (User Interface Logic) contains the logic that is necessary to construct the presentation.  This could be handled by JSP technology.
:* The servlet acts as the '''controller''' and contains the logic that is necessary to process user events and to select an appropriate response.
:*The business logic ('''model''') actually accomplishes the goal of the interaction. This might be a query or an update to a database.  This could be handled by EJB technology.
: For more information about MVC, please see [[w:Model-view-controller|MVC]].

== Jini ==
After J2EE Sun had a vision about the next step of network computing. That is [[w:Jini|Jini]]. The main idea is that in a network environment, there would be many independent services and consumers. Jini would allow these services/consumers to interact dynamically with each other in a robust way. The basic features of Jini are:
* '''No user intervention''' is needed when services are brought on or offline. (In contrast to EJBs where the client program has to know the server and port number where the EJB is deployed, in Jini the client is ''supposed to find'', to discover, the service in the network.)
* '''Self healing''' by adapting when services (consumers of services) come and go. (Services periodically need to renew a lease to indicate that they are still available.)
* Consumers of JINI services do not need prior knowledge of the service's implementation. The '''implementation is downloaded dynamically''' and run on the consumer JVM, without configuration and user intervention. (For example, the end user may be presented with a slightly different user interface depending upon which service is being used at the time. The implementation of the user interface code would be provided by the service being used.)

A minimal Jini network environment consists of:
* One or more '''services'''
* A '''lookup-service''' keeping a list of registered services
* One or more '''consumers'''

Jini is not widely used at the current writing (2006). There are two possible reasons for it. One is Jini a bit complicated to understand and to set it up. The other reason is that Microsoft pulled out from Java, which caused the industry to turn to the use of proprietary solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autisim'''

==What is autism?==
*Disorder of brain function that appears early in life -- before the age of 3
*Autism belongs to a family of related brain conditions affecting behavior early in life, which are often referred to as pervasive developmental disorder
*Cause of autism is unknown

==Traits associated with autism==
*social detachment, e.g., failure to smile at parents and an unawareness of events around them
*abnormal language development, such as repeating phrases in a mechanical voice
*unusual repetitive movements, e.g., rocking and flicking fingers
*mental retardation (usually in more severe cases)
*Traits vary in severity and persist into adulthood
*Some individuals with autism have amazing skills (e.g. Rainman)

==Incidence==
*Savant syndrome is quite rare (only about 200 cases ever recorded)
*childhood autism is more common, affecting about one in 700 children
*Boys are affected four times more often than girls

==Can autism &quot;run in families&quot;?==
*If a child has autism, each of the parent's later children has a 3% to 9% chance of having autism.
*This is 100 to 200 times greater than in the general population.
*Believed to be multifactorial inheritance
*Genetic component supported by twin studies


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Type of twin pair !! Number of twin pairs !! Twin pairs in which both twins had autism (&quot;concordance rate&quot;)
|-
| Identical twins || 25 || 60% (15 of 25 pairs)
|-
| Non-identical twins || 20 || 0% (0 of 20 pairs)
|}

*The second study used the same twins, but changed the definition of autism
*new definition was looser -- people with milder behavioral problems were counted as autistic

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Type of twin pair !! Number of twin pairs !! Twin pairs in which both twins had &quot;expanded&quot; autism (&quot;concordance rate&quot;)
|-
| Identical twins || 25 || 92% (23 of 25 pairs)
|-
| Non-identical twins || 20 || 10% (2 of 20 pairs)
|}




==Genes involved in autism==
*no gene found yet
*Several candidate regions on chromosomes have been identified through linkage studies

==Differential Diagnosis==
(known genetic conditions that may share some symptoms of autism)
*Fragile X syndrome (the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome).
*Tuberous sclerosis (the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9).
*Duplications of part of the long arm of chromosome 15.
*Untreated phenylketonuria (the PAH gene on chromosome 12)

==Environmental factors==
*UNKNOWN
*Autism was thought to result from certain events before or shortly after birth
*Infection of the brain with herpes virus and infection of the pregnant mother with rubella virus
*Problems with brain structure are associated with autism, including hydrocephalus and, very rarely, a brain tumor
*1993 British study was reviewed by both the Medical Research Council in Great Britain and the Centers for Disease Control in the United States
*The Centers for Disease Control concluded that: &quot;to date there is no conclusive evidence that any vaccine can cause autism&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Autism'''

==What is autism?==
*Autism is considered an organic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social, communication, and intellectual developmental disturbance.
*It was first described in 1943, and was thought at the time that parents were not giving their children enough love and attention. It is now realized that the parents are in no way to blame for the condition.
*It is generally diagnosed by age three. Based on age of onset, it may be called infantile autism or childhood-onset autism (also called pervasive developmental disorder). These have not been proven to be different disorders, although infantile autism is usually more severe.
*Characterized by a state of self-absorbance, delayed communication, and a need to maintain routine and repetitive bizarre motor patterns.
*Associated with fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, PKU, and Tourette's syndrome.
*There are not medical tests for autism. Diagnosis is based on observations of the child's behavior. Speech, hearing, and psychological tests are often done.
*An EEG (electroencephalogram) is often done to look at brain wave abnormalities, which indicate epilepsy. Children with autism sometimes develop epilepsy as they get older.
*Severity of autism is highly variable.

==Symptoms==
*Usually, parents first notice that their baby does not respond to them. The baby may not look at the parents or may not want to be picked up and held.
*Slow development or lack of physical, social, and learning skills.
*Development may appear to be uneven. For example, motor development may be normal, but talking is delayed. Also, the child may show a talent for music or drawing but be unable to go to a regular school.
*Immature rhythms of speech, limited understanding of ideas, use of words without attaching the usual meaning to them.
*Unresponsive to what is said to them. May appear to be deaf, but really they do not learn the meaning of words. Often seem to be talking to themselves instead of to people around them.
*Sometimes indicate their needs by gesturing, but usually scream, cry, or have temper tantrums.
*Abnormal responses to sensations. Sight, hearing, touch, pain, balance, smell, taste, may be affected.
*Abnormal ways of relating to people, objects, and events. Typically, children with autism do not respond appropriately to adults and other children. Objects and toys are not used as normally intended.
*Normal relationships with others do not develop. They have difficulty playing with other children. May be withdrawn and inactive.
*Repetition of actions, words, or body movements such as twirling objects or flapping their hands. Seem to want their lives to be patterns and may become upset by a change in routine.

==Quick List of Common Behaviors==
*No cuddling
*Resistance to change in routine
*No eye contact
*Difficulty mixing with other children
*Gesturing to show needs
*No fear of real dangers
*Acting as if deaf
*Standoffish manner
*Resistance to learning
*Sustained odd play
*Marked physical overactivity
*Inappropriate attachment to objects
*Inappropriate laughing and giggling
*Spinning of objects
*Rocking movements or hand flapping
*Sparse, meaningless, or echo speech

==Prevalence==
*Incidence is estimated at 4-5/10,000
*Affects all race, ethnicities, and social classes equally
*More common in males (3 or 4 to 1), but females are more severely affected
*About 75% are mentally retarded (IQ below 70)

==Causes of Autism==
*Research suggests it is caused by a defect in brain functioning.
*Multifactorial inheritance with a strong clustering in families.

==Prognosis==
*Variable, but at least 2/3 remain severely handicapped as adults.
*There is no cure.
*Normal life expectancy.
*1/3 of children develop epilepsy or seizures.
*Many often improve as they grow older, but will continue to have problems relating to others. Adolescence may worsen behavior problems in some

==Management==
*Treatment consists of educational and behavioral methods aimed at decreasing behavioral symptoms and aiding in the development of language and self-help skills.
*Psychopharmacotherapy is often helpful.

==Inheritance==
*A couple with one autistic child has a 1/50 chance of having another. This is higher is the couple has an affected female child.
*The brothers and sisters and close relatives of children with autism have more problems such as epilepsy, learning disabilities, and mental retardation.

*Autism Society of America

*Medical history, family history, diagnosis, genetics, recurrence risk, testing options and limitations

==Pediatric Intake==
*Pregnancy and Medical History
**focus on possible rubella during pregnancy, PKU, infantile spasms, seizures, balance problems, fragile X testing?
*Developmental History
**Social skills? (delay in play ~ 2 years old? Prefers to spend time alone? Friendship group? Eye contact?)

==What is &quot;Asperger Disorder&quot; or &quot;Asperger's Syndrome&quot;?==
*A type of autism that involves a developmental disorder of brain function
*Autism in general involves three areas:
**communication (verbal and non-verbal)
**socialization (interactions with others)
**behavior
*diagnosis of a type of autism depends on differences in language development, severity of symptoms, age of onset, and clinical features
*Symptoms
*severity is highly variable
*repetitive movements (i.e., rocking) and routines
*reduced pain sensitivity
*aggressive behavior
*can injure themselves (i.e., biting, head-banging)
*inability to form emotional bonds with people
*social and communication skills impaired
*unusual responses to stimuli (sensitive to sound, light, touch)
*clumsy movements
*seizures (1/3 of people with autism will have them)
*children with &quot;Asperger Disorder&quot; or &quot;Asperger's Syndrome&quot; do not show a history of language delay
*intelligence is usually normal
**Etiology
*caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function, sometimes combined with environmental factors
*brain cells may migrate to the [[wrong place]] in the brain
*parts of the communication network may fail to form due to problems with neural pathways
*coordination of thoughts, feelings, and actions may be impaired
*a number of candidate genes that may play a role in causing Asperger Disorder have been identified and are currently being researched

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*inheritance is likely multifactorial (genes plus environment)
*candidate genes found on chromosomes 6,7,9, 15, X
*Incidence and Carrier Frequency (autism)
*1-2 people per 1,000
*2,000 to 4,000 children born each year
*affects all races, ethnicities, and social classes at equal rates
*3X to 4X more common in boys that in girls
*often associated with other genetic disorders
*Fragile X (found in 10% of people with autism)
*Tuberous Sclerosis (1/4 of those affected have autism)

==Recurrence risks==
*overall = up to 8.5%
*affected male = 7%
*affected female = 14.5%

==Natural History==
*symptoms of autism usually appear between 24 and 36 months of age
*symptoms of Asperger Disorder typically appear later in childhood
*loss of social skills they may have already developed
*aggressiveness may increase
*obsession with a particular subject
*no cure
*normal life expectancy

==Testing==
*currently, there is no medical test to differentiate between the types of autism (diagnosis must be done clinically)
*chromosome analysis might detect ~5% of autism (associated with abnormalities on the 6,9, 7, 15, and X chromosomes)

==Management==
*~60% of people with autism will need care throughout adulthood
**Education
*Special educational services?
*I.E.P? Use of visual aids, structured schedule, teacher-to-student ratio? Positive reinforcement? Step-related tasks?
*Behavior-based interventions at school?
*Routine; clear consequences?
**Behavior
*Behavior Management Specialist
*reinforcement of routine/rules both at home and at school
*regular positive reinforcement and rewards
*Support system for parents?
*coping mechanisms may include planning for time away from the child, joining support groups, becoming an active advocate for people with autism, planning for the future once they are gone

==Treatment==
*some drugs are available to treat symptoms and behavioral problems
**please note that none of these drugs has been specifically approved for use with people with autism by the F.D.A. and should be taken only under close consultation with a physician *
*drugs used to treat anxiety and depression (Prozac, Luvox, Zoloft, Anafranil) may relieve some symptoms
*Anafranil (clomipramine) may reduce obsessive, repetitive behaviors
*Ritalin may reduce hyperactivity (has been shown to be more effective in those who are higher-functioning and do not have seizures)
*Vitamin B6 may stimulate brain activity

==Psychosocial Issues==
*impending adolescence will likely bring a new awareness that the person is somehow different from their peers
*may result in feelings of social isolation, loneliness, anxiety, sadness
*lowering of self-confidence and withdrawal may occur
*stress levels of caregivers may be high due to:
**expectations
**desire for a &quot;normal&quot; child (feelings of guilt, denial, anger)
**too high or too low for the child?
**frustration, shame, or disappointment that they are not met
**pressure to socialize with others? (denial)
**feeling like other parents don't know what you are dealing with or going through
**sadness at loss of hopes and dreams for the child
**frustration with possible changing diagnosis?
**dealing with challenging behaviors of children (anger, frustration, helplessness)
*coordinating services (time and energy commitment)
*maintaining continuity/routine
*communicating child's needs to the school
*financial strain
*does insurance cover any therapy?
*lack of personal support system (partner, family, church, friends?)
*lack of or inability to attend community support groups

==Contracting==
*Why were you referred here today?
*What are you most concerned about?
*Outline goals of session namely talking about causes of developmental delay, explaining the results of lab test - balanced robertsonian translocation, and examination

==Elicit Medical History==
*Ask about history of delays and developmental milestones.
*Ask about any perinatal infections.
*Ask after past and current interventions.
*Get pregnancy history of the mother including any infections or exposures to possible teratogens.
*Ask about history of miscarriages or stillbirths.

==Family History==
*Ask specifically about occurrence of miscarriage or stillbirth on mother and father's side of family.
*Also ask about history of delays in family members and mental retardation.

==Genes and Chromosomes==
*Use Greenwood book and karyotype in explanation.
*Cells make up the body; each cell contains chromosomes which are made of a chemical called DNA which in turn contains genes.
*Genes are like recipes that are instructions to make proteins such as skin, muscle and organs.
*In the lab, technicians break open the cell and these are what chromosomes look like.
*There are 46 chromosomes total in humans, 23 come from mom in her egg and 23 from dad in his sperm. So one chromosome 1 comes from mom and the other from dad to form the 23 pairs.
*The 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes. Women have two XXs and Men have an X and Y. The Y chromosomes is not really shaped like a Y, but is named that to distinguish it from the X.
*Chromosomes are able to exchange DNA with each other. Sometimes this happens with two different chromosomes of different pairs such as number 13 and 15. Also, an arm of one chromosome can become attached to the arm of another. These are called translocations.
*Certain chromosomes with one very short arm and one very long arm are involved in a Robertsonian translocation. The short arms become detached from the long arms and are lost, but the long arms attach to each other forming one large chromosome from two smaller ones. The small arms of these chromosomes do not contain genes, so no significant information is lost. This is called a balanced Robertsonian translocation.
*Your lab results show that this happened between one chromosome 13 and a one 15. Because the two chromosomes essentially joined together into one, the lab report shows you have 45 chromosomes instead of 46.

==Robertsonian Translocations==
*Can occur de novo or can be inherited.
*Cytogenetic testing of blood relatives can be done to detect de novo or familial translocation.
*Are one of most common types of translocation and is detected in 1/1000 fetuses by amniocentesis.
*Occurs in a germ cell before meiosis and involves the acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15 (D), and 21, 22 (G).
*The short arms of two chromosomes are lost and the long arms joined end to end at the centromeres. They may be homologous or non-homologous chromosomes that are joined, e.g. t21;21 or t13;15 respectively.
*D/D translocations occur between chr. 13-15. D/G occurs between one of 13-15 and one 21-22. G/G occurs between 21-22.

==Balanced and Unbalanced Translocations==
*Balanced translocations normally do not cause any abnormal phenotype.
*Unbalanced translocations can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or a birth of a baby with multiple malformations, developmental delay, and mental retardation (Maternal-Fetal Medicine: Principles and Practices, 1994).
*Unbalanced translocations occur when a diploid germ cell with a translocation goes through meiosis. Abnormal segregation of the chromosomes in which only a portion or more than 1 copy of any part of either chromosome involved in the translocation can result in a fetus with an unbalanced translocation upon fertilization.

==Risks Associated with Balanced Translocation Carriers==
*If a familial translocation has been detected through an individual with an unbalanced translocation, then the recurrence risk of having another child with an unbalanced translocation is 15%.
*If not biased by the presence of an individual with an unbalanced translocation, then the recurrence risk is 1-2%.
*Risk for both situations for spontaneous miscarriage is 25%.
*Couples with a D/D translocation are at decreased risk (1-2%) of having a child with an unbalanced translocation since loss or gain of genetic information in these chromosomes is lethal.
*Maternal carriers of balanced translocations have greater likelihood than paternal carriers of having children with unbalanced translocations.

==Developmental Delay==
*Unknown cause in 50% of cases.
*Result of environmental and/or genetic factors.
*Approximately 2000 genetic causes are known which include chromosomal abnormalities, metabolic or endocrine disorders, hereditary degenerative disorders, hormonal deficiency, hereditary syndromes.
*Environmental causes are infection, irradiation, or exposure to certain toxins during prenatal development. Peri or postnatal causes are prematurity, anoxia, cerebral damage, infection, toxins, hormone deficiencies, metabolic disorders, epilepsy.
*Prevalence of people with some form of mental retardation is 1-3% in US.
*Intervention services are available very early and reach into adulthood. Assessment of development done at CCDD. School system provides services in the form of Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and focuses on special services like speech therapy. Adults can be provided with job training and many live in group homes.

==Clinical Features of Mental Retardation==
*Affects developmental and cognitive abilities.
*IQ score lower than 70.
*Ranges are: Mild, 50-55 to 70; Moderate, 35-40 to 50-55; Severe, 20-25 to 35-40; Profound, below 20-25.
*Most individuals with MR range between 55-69.
*People with MR may have limits in the following: communication, work, self-care, social skills, self-direction, and academic skills, living alone.
*Onset is before 18 years.

==Recurrence Risks==
*Difficult to calculate risk if cause is unknown.
*Empiric risk around 10%

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Provision of adequate intervention
*Burden of taking care of individual with MR
*Affects sibling and other family relationships.
*Uncertainty as to cause of MR and recurrence risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Balanced Translocation'''

==Introduction and Contracting==
*Can you explain in your own words what you understand about why you were referred to genetics?
*What are your main concerns for ______ at this time?
*Do you have any specific questions you would like us to make sure we try to answer?

==Outline session==
*Take medical and family history
*Review the chromosome results with you
*Explain more about why we want to do chromosome testing on you (parents)
*Dr Viskochil will examine him
*We will then make sure to discuss any further questions or concerns

==Medical/Developmental History==
*follow form that I started filling out and confirm info

==Family History==
*3 generation pedigree
*include standard questions don't forget miscarriages as they occur more frequently in people with balanced translocation

==Explain Chromosomes and Genes (using sample karyotype)==
*When the lab looked at _____ 's cells under a microscope they found a change in the chromosomes
*The change they found was called a translocation

==What is a translocation?==
*Transfer of chromosomal material between chromosomes

==Why do translocations happen?==
*We do not really know why - (Sort of. It happens because it is possible. And its possible because of the inherent nature of the genetic material.)
*Estimated that about 1 person in 500 has a chromosome translocation
*We know that our chromosomes seem to break and rejoin quite often, and it is only sometimes that it leads to problems
*These changes are out of our control, and nearly always translocations happen in either the egg or sperm cell before they join together
*Therefore they are not likely to be caused by anything during the pregnancy

==How Translocations Occur==
*Sometimes the chromosomes break during cell division and are usually repaired 
*Sometimes two fragments may break off from two different chromosomes, and &quot;swap&quot; places
*This is called a ''reciprocal'' translocation (this is the type of translocation he has)

==Show Karyotype and Explain Specific Break Points==
*Sometimes helps to see the actual karyotype
*46 means that the usual number of chromosomes is present
*Y chromosome is what makes him male
*T stands for translocation, where a piece of chromosome 2 and 21 exchanged places
*The rest just tells us more exactly where the chromosomes broke
*So arrows are pointing to where the chromosomal material exchanged places

==Balanced Translocations==
*In most cases, there is no loss or gain of chromosomal material during the exchange process
*When the lab looked they didn't see any missing or extra pieces of chromosomes and they therefore think that this might be a balanced translocation

==What Are the Effects==
*Often people will have a balanced translocation and not even know because they don't experience any problems (this occurs in majority of cases of new balanced rearrangements Warburton 1991)
*Sometimes, apparently balanced translocation carriers show some characteristics or symptoms (Warburton showed that frequency of abnormality was 6.1% but confidence interval includes 3% in apparently balanced translocations)
*One explanation for this finding is that the break may have occurred in the middle of a gene that is important in growth or development and the gene no longer provides correct instructions because it is disrupted
*We do not know if this translocation is the explanation for the characteristics and health problems in ______

==What will results from parental chromosomes tell us==
*In order to determine what the translocation might mean it is important to do chromosomes on all parents of children with a translocation
*If a parent has the same translocation and they do not have any of the same symptoms or characteristics as the child then we cannot conclude that the translocation is the cause
*If neither parent has the translocation than it may explain some or all of the characteristics and health problems in ______, but would be difficult to know for certain
*Parental chromosomes will also be important because it will help us determine what risks might be to future offspring

==What can happen in offspring of people with balanced translocation==
*If one of the parents carries a balanced translocation, it is possible for a child of theirs to acquire a bit of extra chromosome material or a bit missing
*Either of these would be known as an UNBALANCED translocation
*This extra and or missing pieces of chromosome can unfortunately cause serious mental, physical and medical challenges in the child who inherits them
*Sometimes they cause a miscarriage, but not always
*However, it is also possible for these same parents to have a child with normal chromosomes, or a child with the same balanced rearrangement of their chromosomes as the parent
*Having a balanced translocation of your chromosomes does not mean you cannot have normal healthy children
*Factors that influence risks (not applicable in this case)
*Ascertainment - A family ascertained as a result of a previously affected child is seen to be at increased risk of recurrence since the imbalance has been proved viable.
*Risk of having an affected child is lower when a family is ascertained following for example repeated spontaneous miscarriage since in these cases the imbalance is more likely to be inviable
*Each time they have a child, there are several possibilities.
**they may have a child with normal chromosomes
**they may have a child with the same balanced rearrangement of the chromosomes as the parent
**they may have a child with an unbalanced rearrangement of the chromosomes which may cause mental and physical challenges
**the pregnancy may end in a miscarriage

==What sort of problems do unbalanced translocations cause?==
*Can be difficult to predict because it depends on:
*Which parts of chromosomes are missing or duplicated (aneuploidy for 4p, distal 4q and 9p for example all have a high degree of viability therefore relatively high risk)
*how large of pieces they are (if large less likely to be viable due to more extra or missing information)
*There are not usually the same breaking points for each translocation because it is random so we don't have any other children to compare this exact translocation to
*Nearly always have learning problems though if translocation is unbalanced

==Tests in Pregnancy for Translocation Carriers==
*amniocentesis This is usually done from 14 weeks in the pregnancy and the result normally takes about 2 weeks.
*Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) usually done between 10-12 weeks in the pregnancy, and the results take about 2 weeks.

==Psychosocial Considerations==
*Information can be difficult to understand because translocations are not an easy concept
*Don't expect them to remember everything, we will provide a summary in a letter we will write
*People who have a balanced translocation of their chromosomes do not have a disease that can be &quot;caught&quot; by other people
*Guilt about possibly passing this on (not under our control can't cause or prevent)
*What do other family members know and do you plan on telling them
*Either parent considering having more children because this may alter their plans or could be upsetting to think they may have a recurrence risk if they didn't think so before

== Copy Location ==
[[Image:C_loc.gif]]

The Copy Location constraint does as the name states: it will copy the location of the target to the source (constrained object). Less Influence will drag the constrained object less and less to the target.

If it's an armature, a new field will appear to let you tell which bone will be the target. Don't forget TABKEY completion while writing the name of your object/bone!

You can tell Blender to work only on the selected axis. Many uses are possible :)

== The Constraint Panel ==
[[Image:C_loc panel.jpg]]

* The Target field will let you select which Object the constraint holder will follow.

== Where To Use It ==
Most of the time this little constraint is useful to stick objects to one another. By playing with the Influence you can tell when it will work, when it will remain motionless.

A good use of it is to ask a character to pick up something. By having a bone or empty for each side of the releationship (hand &lt;-&gt; glass), as the hand approaches the glass, you can align the two empties and fire the constraint up (1.00) to stick them together. You add another child-bone in the middle of the hand to tell where the glass will be. Thus moving the hand will move the glass. On the side of the glass just add an empty and make it parent of the glass. Add a copy location to the empty pointing to the bone in the hand we just did. There you go. Of course when the hand rotates the glass will not. For that you will need to add a Copy Rotation Constraint.

Before Blender 2.40, the above method  was a good way of faking parent relationship without rotation. But now we have the hinge option which does the same.

Create this kind of tracking device using the X Y Z toggle button

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bardet-Biedl Syndrome'''

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance: Autosomal Recessive. It requires a recessive mutation in one of six loci plus an additional mutation in a second locus, known as triallelic inheritance.
*Chromosome locations: This syndrome is linked to 6 different loci-BBS1 on 11q13, BBS2 on 16q21, BBS3 on 3p13, BBS4 on 15q22.3, BBS5 on 2q31, and BBS6 on 20p12
Incidence and Carrier Frequency
*Incidence is 1 in 100,000, with an increased prevalence in Arab and Bedouin populations (1 in 13,500). Carrier frequency is 1 in 179.

==Clinical Features==
*Obesity
*Eye Problems: Rod-cone dystrophy (major)
**Retinitis pigmentosa
**Strabismus
**Cataracts
*Mouth and Tooth Problems: High arched palate
**Dental crowding
**Hypodontia
**Small tooth roots
*Cardiac Problems: Left ventricular hypertrophy
**Other congenital heart defects
**Hypertension
*Hepatic Fibrosis
*Hirschsprung disease (less than 10% of patients)
*Hypogonadism (major)
*Undescended testes (10%)
*Hypothyroidism
*Asthma (27%)
*Renal Problems (major): Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
**Irregular kidney contour (fetal lobulation)
**Polydipsia and Polyuria (66% of patients)
**Recurrent urinary tract infections (30% of patients)
*Polydactyly of hands and/or feet (major)
*Brachydactyly of hands
*Speech delays
*Ataxia
*Developmental delay
*Learning disabilities (major)
*Diabetes mellitus (15-45% of patients)
*A clinical diagnosis is made with the presence of 4 major features or 3 major and 2 minor features
*Age of onset is usually early childhood.
*Life span is variable, depending on severity and management of symptoms.
Testing
*Chromosomal testing is available. This can be done prenatally as well as postnatally.

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*In the clinic, fundoscopic examination of the eyes should be performed through dilated pupils as well as blood pressure measurement and urinalysis for glucose, protein and leukocytes. Baseline investigations should include ERG/VER, ECG, echocardiogram, ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract and either an IVP or DMSA/DPTA scan. The child should be evaluated by cardiology, ophthalmology, urology, nephrology, genetics, speech, endocrinology, and orthopedics. It is not possible to cure this condition, but regular follow-up for symptoms can improve quality of life.

==Psychosocial Issues==
*Guilt, fear, anger, anxiety, sadness, desperation, and depression are common feelings associated with this diagnosis. It is important to assess the family situation, support system, financial position, and living environment as well as offer any resources to families that may be helpful

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Becker Muscular Dystrophy'''

==General Information==
*Dystrophinopathies
**Characterized by a spectrum of muscle disease that ranges from mild to severe
**Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy is severe
***Skeletal muscle is primarily affected in both
***DMD is rapidly progressive and presents in early childhood.
****Patients are often wheelchair-bound by age 12
***Becker is characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness
****Patients remain ambulatory into their 20s
****Despite milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death
****Mean age of death is in the mid-40s
*Dystrophin gene
**Xp21.2
**Encodes protein dystrophin
**85% of males with BMC have deletions or duplications involving exons of this gene
**Molecular genetic testing is available clinically
*Prevalence
**1 in 18,000 live male births

==Diagnosis==
*Clinical
**Family history
***Compatible with X-linked recessive inheritance
**Creatine Phosphokinase (CK) concentration
***Evaluated by blood test
***Elevated serum CK concentration results from progressive elimination of dystrophic muscle fibers.
****Can also result from strenuous exercise
***CK concentration gradually decreases with advancing age due to the progressive elimination of these muscle fibers.
***100% of males with BMD have a serum CK concentration &gt;5x normal
***~30% of female carriers have a concentration 2-10x normal
****Some investigations have shown a wide variability in BMD carriers
****Many have levels within the normal range, so other tests are necessary
****CPK is not completely reliable
**Clinical findings
***Progressive symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy, proximal greater than distal, often with calf hypertrophy
****Weakness of quadriceps femoris may be the only sign
***Activity-induced cramping in some patients
***Flexion contractus of the elbows may occur late in the course
***Wheelchari dependency, if present, after 16 years of age
***Preservation of neck flexor muscle strength in BMD differentiates it from DMD
*Molecular genetic testing
**Deletions involving one or more exons of the DMD gene
***~85% of males with BMD have deletions
***Testing is done by PCR or southern blot
***Available on a clinical basis
**The remaining ~15% have duplications of one or more exons of the DMD gene or other mutations such as small deletions or insertions, single base changes, or splicing mutations
**Carrier testing may be performed but requires quantitative analysis for gene dosage which can be difficult to perform and interpret
**Prenatal testing is available

==Clinical Description==
*Males
**Characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness (as compared to DMD which presents ~ age 4 years)
***Patients remain ambulatory into their 20s with BMD
**Heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death
**The mild end of the spectrujm includes men with onset of symptoms after age 30 years who remain ambulatory even into their 60s
**Cognitive impairment is not as common or as sever as in DMD
*Females
**Occasionally have clinical features as the result of X chromosome rearrangements involving the DMD locus (Xp21.2)
**81% of BMD carriers have no signs or symptoms
**14% have mild to moderate muscle weakness
**16% have left ventricle dilation
**5% have myalgia or cramps
**No BMD carrier females have been found to have dilated cardiomyopathy
*Genotype-Phenotype Correlations
**In males, phenotypes are best correlated with the degree of expression of dystrophin, which is largely determine by the reading frame of the spliced messaged obtained from the deleted allele
**The BMD phenotype occurs when there is some dystrophin, usually resulting from:
***Deletions or duplications that juxtapose &quot;in-frame&quot; exons
***Some splicing mutations
***Most non-truncating single base changes that result in translation of a protein product with intact N or C termini
**A dystrophin protein that retains partial function produces the milder BMD phenotype
*Management
**There is no treatment for BMD
**Appropriate management can prolong survival and improve quality of life
***Physical therapy to promote mobility
****Range-of-motion exercises
***Braces to delay the onset of contractures
***Monitoring and surgical intervention for orthopedic complications
****Scoliosis, kyphosis, or lordosis
***Routine monitoring for evidence of cardiomyopathy
**All carriers should have a complete cardiac evaluation at least once

==Differential Diagnosis==
*Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
**A group of disorders clinically similar to DMD
**Occurs in both sexes
**Caused by mutations I genes that encode sarcoglycans and other proteins that interact with dystrophin
*Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
**Associated with limb contractures and cardiac arrhythmia
*X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms
**Caused by mutations in the LMNA gene
*Spinal muscular atrophy
**Caused by mutations in the SMN gene
**Characterized by:
***Poor muscle tone
***Symmetric muscle weakness that spares the face and ocular muscles
***Evidence of anterior horn cell involvement
****Includes fasciculations of the tongue and absence of deep tendon reflexes
*Dilated cardiomyopathy
**Can be sporadic or familial
*No other phenotypes are associated with mutations in the DMD gene

==Inheritance==
*X-linked recessive
**Carrier females have a 50% chance of transmitting the BMD mutation in each pregnancy
**With each pregnancy, a carrier has a 25% chance of having an affected child
*Risk to family members
**A woman with an affected son and one other affected relative in the maternal line is an obligate heterozygote
**A woman with more than one affected son and no other family history can have:
***A germline mutation
****DMD disease-causing mutation present in every cell
***Germline mosaicism
****Mosaicism for a DMD disease-causing mutation which includes the germline
****The frequency of germline mosaicism in DMD is estimated at 12% to 20%
**If proband is only affected family member, must determine if mother and other females are carriers
***The proband may have a de novo DMD disease-causing mutation
****The mutation could have occurred in the egg at the time of conception
****The mutation could have occurred after conception and therefore is present in some but not all cells of the proband's body.
****The likelihood that the mother is a carrier is low
***The proband's mother may have a de novo mutation
****2/3 of mothers of sporadically occurring males with DMD are carriers
****Could have occurred if:
*****Mutation occurred in the egg or sperm at the time of her conception and is present in every cell of her body (germline mutation)
*****Mutation is present in some but not all cells of her body (somatic mosaicism)
*****Mutation is present only in her egg cells (germline mosaicism) and is not detected in a blood sample.
***The proband's mother may have inherited a DMD mutation from her mother who is a carrier, her mother or father who has somatic mosaicism, or her mother or father who has germline mosaicism.

==Risk Assessment==
*All daughters of a male affected with BMD are carriers; none of the sons will inherit the mutation

==Ordering the test==
*Patient must sign consent form for DNA analysis
**Use blue ink so it is obvious which is the original
**Give the patient a copy
**Put the original in the chart
*Use special specimen processing request form
**Make a copy for the chart
**Give a copy to Lori Martineek at E352
*Blood is drawn at Test Referral Center
**Pt must have consent form, 2-ply specimen processing request form, and DNA analysis requisition
**Tell pt to make sure her name is on the tube of blood
**TRC will FedEx to Dr. Prior's lab
*Contact Dr. Thomas W. Prior to inform him that you are sending the sample
**Prior-1@medctr.osu.edu
**Give him clinical history and lab report # from prior testing

      <text xml:space="preserve">==DRM==
For those that don't know:

What DRM is trying to do is not at all impossible or futile from a design point of view. Sure, there is an analog hole, but that degrades quality. High-quality digital copies can be very well controlled by DRM.

Consider the next-generation AMD processor in a motherboard with a TPM chip. Here is how it works.

#A regular OS load happens. This may be compromised of course, but that gets detected later.
#The OS sets aside 64 kB of physically linear RAM, then loads some code into it.
#The OS executes a special new CPU instruction (opcode) to enter trusted (evil) mode.
#The CPU performs a special bus cycle to inform other CPUs and restrict DMA access to the 64 kB chunk.
#A well-protected chip on the motherboard is granted access to this memory.
#The well-protected chip verifies a digital signature, then grants access to itself.
#The CPU begins executing the trusted and protected 64 kB.
#The CPU is placed into a new hypervisor-like mode, with the 64 kB of code in control. Unlike normal CPUs, these CPUs have 8 protection rings (not just 4) and an enhanced ability to virtualize themselves. The 64 kB of code can do something a bit like VMWare, but with less performance loss.
#The 64 kB of code checks a digital signature on the regular OS.
#The regular OS, now somewhat trusted because of the digital signature, can continue execution. The 64 kB of special code remains protected by hardware though, and retains the ability to monitor execution of the regular OS. The regular OS can ask the 64 kB of special code to perform various services in cooperation with the well-protected chip.

Now remember that encryption is happening on the monitor cable, the FireWire cable, etc.

Oh, you want to stop this with a custom driver? Sorry. The obvious problem is that an unsigned driver could be refused, but remember that the 64 kB of special trusted code is running the rest of the OS in a sort of virtual machine. In particular, memory writes can be intercepted via the permission bits in the page tables. There are '''''two''''' sets of page tables. Stuff first gets remapped by the ones the regular OS is handling, then gets remapped by the page tables that the 64 kB of trusted code is handling.

By this mechanism and by control of DMA, the 64 kB can be safely expanded. Whole videos could be decrypted into protected memory, though this isn't really required since the regular OS can be verified and protected.

Yeah, and exactly who the hell is researching DRM hardware? Excepting Intel maybe, nobody. The fact is, you're blatantly misusing language. Everyone OTHER than you understands DRM research to mean DRM software *development*. You mean it in a very narrow non-standard sense, and you never bother to explain what sense it is you do mean it.

=Native XML Database=
The term '''Native XML database''': has become popular since 1999, after the company Software AG released the first version of its native XML server Tamino, which included a native XML database. A definition of a native databases is that it:

&quot;[d]efines a (logical) model for an XML document and stores and retrieves documents according to that model.&quot; (Bourret, 2002)&quot;

To model data in XML, two principle approaches are used: Data-centric documents and Document-centric documents.

*Data-centric documents (for data transport) have fairly regular structure, order typically does not matter, and little or no mixed content.

*Document-centric documents (usually for human consumption) have less regular or irregular structure, significant order of the elements, and lots of mixed content.


Examples of Native databases


&lt;table width=&quot;60%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;Developer&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;License&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th width=&quot;15%&quot;&gt;DB Type&lt;/th&gt;

==eXist==
[http://exist.sourceforge.net/ eXist] is an Open Source effort to develop a native XML database system, tightly integrated with existing XML development tools like Apache's Cocoon. The database may be easily deployed, running either standalone, inside a servlet engine, or directly embedded in an application.

Some features that are available in eXist and that can be found in most Native XML databases are :


*Schema-less storage - Documents do not have to be associated to schema or document type, meaning they are allowed to be well formed only.

*Collections - A collection plays a similar role to a directory in a file system. When submitting a query the user can choose a distinct part of the collection hierarchy or even all the documents contained in the database.

*Query languages - The most popular query languages supported by Native XML databases are XPath (with extensions for queries over multiple documents) and XQuery.

=Relational Databases=
Database vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Sybase have developed tools to assist in converting XML documents into relational tables.

Let us look at IBM and Oracle:


==IBM Technology==
'''DB2 XML Extender''' provides access, storage and transformation for XML data through user-defined functions and stored procedure. It offers 2 key storage models: '''XML Colums''' and '''XML Collections'''.


1. XML Column: stores and retrieves entire XML documents as DB2 column data. Use of XML Columns is recommended when XML    documents already exist and/or when there is a need to store XML documents in their entity.

2. XML Collection: composes XML Documents from a collection of relational tables.


A '''data access definition (DAD)''' file is used for both XML Column and XML Collection approaches to define the &quot;mapping&quot; between the database tables and the structure of the XML document.

&lt;Xcollection&gt; Specifies that the XML data is either to be decomposed from XML documents into a collection of relational tables, or to be composed into XML documents from a collection of relational tables.

The DAD file defines the XML document tree structure, using the following kinds of nodes:

*root_node - Specifies the root element of the document. 
*element_node - Identifies an element, which can be the root element or a child element. 
*text_node - Represents the CDATA text of an element. 
*attribute_node - Represents an attribute of an element.



&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; 
&lt;!DOCTYPE DAD SYSTEM &quot;&quot;c:\dxx\samples\db2xml\dtd\dad.dtd&quot;&gt; 
&lt;DAD&gt; 
  ...
&lt;Xcollection&gt; 
&lt;SQL_stmt&gt; 
       ...
&lt;/SQL_stmt&gt; 
&lt;prolog&gt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&lt;/prolog&gt; 
&lt;doctype&gt;!DOCTYPE Order SYSTEM
                  &quot;&quot;c:\dxx\samples\db2xml\dtd\getstart.dtd&quot;&quot;&lt;/doctype&gt;
&lt;root_node&gt; 
 &lt;element_node name=&quot;Order&quot;&gt;      --&gt; Identifies the element &lt;Order&gt;
  &lt;attribute_node name=&quot;key&quot;&gt;     --&gt; Identifies the attribute &quot;key&quot; 
   &lt;column name=&quot;order_key&quot;/&gt;     --&gt; Defines the name of the column, 
                                      &quot;order_key&quot;, to which the
                                      element and attribute are
                                      mapped
  &lt;/attribute_node&gt; 
  &lt;element_node name=&quot;Customer&quot;&gt;  --&gt; Identifies a child element of 
                                      &lt;Order&gt; as &lt;Customer&gt;
   &lt;text_node&gt;                    --&gt; Specifies the CDATA text for
                                      the element &lt;Customer&gt;
    &lt;column name=&quot;customer&quot;&gt;      --&gt; Defines the name of the column,
                                      &quot;customer&quot;, to which the child
                                      element is mapped
   &lt;/text_node&gt; 
  &lt;/element_node&gt; 
        ...
 &lt;/element_node&gt;

      ...
&lt;/root_node&gt; 
&lt;/Xcollection&gt;
&lt;/DAD&gt;

==Oracle==
Oracle's '''XML SQL Utility (XSU)''' uses a schematic mapping that defines how to map tables and views, including object-relational features, to XML documents. Oracle translates the chain of object references from the database into the hierarchical structure of XML elements.


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;SQL&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE Customers 
{
     FIRSTNAME      VARCHAR,
     LASTNAME       VARCHAR,
     PHONENO      INT,
     ADDRESS        AddressType, // object reference
     
}

CREATE TYPE AddressType as OBJECT
{  
     ZIP       VARCHAR (100),
     CITY      VARCHAR (100),
     STREET    VARCHAR (100),
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

A corresponding XML document generated from the given object-relational model looks like:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ROWSET&gt;
     &lt;ROW num=&quot;1&quot;&gt; 

        &lt;FIRSTNAME&gt;JOHN&lt;/FIRSTNAME&gt;
        &lt;LASTNAME&gt;SMITH&lt;/LASTNAME&gt;
        &lt;PHONENO&gt;7061234567&lt;/PHONENO&gt;
       
        &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
   &lt;ZIP&gt;30601&lt;/ZIP&gt;
   &lt;CITY&gt;ATHENS&lt;/CITY&gt;
   &lt;STREET&gt;123 MAIN STREEET&lt;/STREET&gt;
        &lt;/ADDRESS&gt;

    &lt;/ROW&gt;

    &lt;!-- additional rows ... --&gt;

 &lt;/ROWSET&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

XSU can be used for executing queries in a Java environment and retrieve XML from the database.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
import oracle.jdbc.driver.*;
import oracle.xml.sql.query.OracleXMLQuery;
import java.lang.*;
import java.sql.*;

// class to test XML document generation as String
class testXMLSQL {

   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
     try {
      // Create the connection
      Connection conn  = getConnection(&quot;root&quot;,&quot;&quot;);

      // Create the query class
      OracleXMLQuery qry = new OracleXMLQuery(conn,
         &quot;SELECT  * FROM Customers&quot;);

      // Get the XML string
      String str = qry.getXMLString();

      // Print the XML output
      System.out.println(&quot;The XML output is:\n&quot;+str);

      // Always close the query to get rid of any resources..
      qry.close();
     } catch(SQLException e) {
      System.out.println(e.toString());
     }
   }

   // Get the connection given the user name and password.!
   private static Connection getConnection(String username,
        String password)
        throws SQLException
   {
      // register the JDBC driver..
       DriverManager.registerDriver(new 
          oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver());

      // Create the connection using the OCI8 driver
       Connection conn =
        DriverManager.getConnection(
           &quot;jdbc:oracle:thin:@dlsun489:1521:ORCL&quot;,username,password);

      return conn;
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=Query Languages=

==XPath==

[[../XPath/]] is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, and is the common locator used by both XSLT and XPointer. An XPath expression is a series of location steps separated by &quot; / &quot;. Each step selects a set of nodes that become the current node(s) for the next step. The set of nodes selected by the expression are the nodes remaining after processing each step in order.


==XQuery==

[[../XQuery/]] is a query language under development by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The ambitious task is to develop the first world standard for querying Web documents. XQuery is a versatile markup language, capable of labeling the information content of diverse data sources including structured and semi-structured documents, relational databases, and object repositories.

=MySQL 5.1=

MySQL has a command line utility for executing queries against a MySQL database; it has an option for using XML as their output format. MySQL also allows convertion to XML; more information can be found in [[../Converting MySQL to XML/]] MySQL allows users to execute any SQL query. mysqldump allows users to specify which tables to dump and to specify a where clause to restrict the rows that are dumped. In its Beta release of MySQL 5.1, several features have been added including new '''XML functions'''.

In order to understand these New functions, we will use the following table:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;mysql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE Customers (doc VARCHAR(150));

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('
&lt;person id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;John&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5678&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
');

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('
&lt;person id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Aminata&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Cisse&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5679&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
');

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
('
&lt;person id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Lamine&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5680&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
');
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==XML Functions==

MySQL version 5.1 has functions for searching and changing XML documents: '''ExtractValue()''' and '''UpdateXML()'''.


*EXTRACTVALUE (XML_document, XPath_string);
This function takes 2 string arguments: The first parameter correspond to the XML_document string, and the 2nd Parameter XPath_string (XPath expression / locator). This will result in the return of the string containing a value from the document. 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mysql&gt; SELECT EXTRACTVALUE(doc,'//firstname') FROM Customers;

+------------------------------------------+
| EXTRACTVALUE(doc,'//firstname')          |
+------------------------------------------+
| John                                     | 
| Aminata                                  | 
| Lamine                                   | 
+------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mysql&gt; SELECT ExtractValue(doc,'/person[@id=&quot;3&quot;]/firstname') as fname FROM Customers;

+---------+
| fname   |
+---------+
|         | 
|         | 
| Lamine  | 
+---------+
3 rows in set (0.02 sec)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;


*UPDATEXML (XML_document, XPath_string, new_value);
This function takes 3 string arguments: The first two paramaters are similar to the ones used with extractValue(), XML_document and XPath_string. The third parameter is the new value that will replace the one found. This function will then returns the changed XML. 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
mysql&gt; SELECT UpdateXML(doc,'/person[@id=&quot;3&quot;]/phoneno', '&lt;phoneno&gt;111-2233&lt;phoneno&gt;') FROM Customers;


+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------+
| UpdateXML(doc,'/person[@id=&quot;3&quot;]/phoneno','&lt;phoneno&gt;111-2233&lt;phoneno&gt;')
                                                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------+
|
&lt;person id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;John&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5678&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
         |
|
&lt;person id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Aminata&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Cisse&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;123-5679&lt;/phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
      |
|
&lt;person id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;firstname&gt;Lamine&lt;/firstname&gt;
      &lt;lastname&gt;Smith&lt;/lastname&gt;
      &lt;phoneno&gt;111-2233&lt;phoneno&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Barthes's Life ===

&quot;Who does not feel how natural it is, in France, to be Catholic, married, and well qualified academically?&quot;&lt;ref name=Thody77&gt;{{cite book|author=Thody, P.|date=1977|pages=5|title=Roland Barthes: A conservative estimate.|location=London|publisher=Trowbridge &amp; Esher.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sentence--found in the book ''Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes'', a collection of Roland Barthes's autobiographical essays--encapsulates his general cynicism about &quot;the natural.&quot;  This semi-ironic question might have originated from his own unique life; he was a Protestant in a predominantly Catholic nation, an unmarried homosexual, and a professor without a doctoral degree.

In 1948 he returned to the academic field. He held positions at the Institute Francais in Bucharest in 1948 and at the University of Alexandria in Egypt in 1949. There, he learned about structural linguistics from A.J. Gremas, a specialist in semantics, and had his &quot;linguistic initiation&quot;&lt;ref name=Wasserman1&gt;{{cite book|author=Wasserman, G.R.|date=1981|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co.|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Writing Degree Zero'' ===

As Todorov&lt;ref name=Torodov&gt;{{cite book|author=Todorov, T.|date=1981|chapter=Late Barthes|editor=in D. Knight (ed.)|title=Critical Essays on Roland Barthes|pages=123-128|location=New York|publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes &quot;It was very difficult to categorize Barthes's texts as belonging to one of the principal types of discourse with which we are familiar, and which our society takes as given,&quot; (in D. Knight, p. 124).  It is difficult to define the category or categories in which he would fit.  First of all, he is frequently seen as a literary critic. Much of his early academic achievement is composed of works of literary criticism written with a semiotic approach.  His later work would reflect his reading of Kristeva, Derrida, and others, and reflect more of a post-structural position. The post-structural critiques find his most representative theme, an argument regarding &quot;the death of author&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barthes77&gt;{{cite book|author=Barthes, R.|date=1977|title=Rhetoric of the Image, in Image, Music, Text,|pages=32-51|editor=S. Health (trans.)|location=New York|publisher=Noonday Press.|origyear=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books ''On Racine'', ''Critical Essays'', and ''Sade, Fourier, Loyola'' are works that advance his thought on literature.  

To some degree his literary criticism was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre.  The first book that Barthes wrote, translated into English as ''Writing Degree Zero'', is in part a response to Sartre's ''What is Literature?''  This is important insofar as it would largely define Barthes's approach not only to literature, but to other media, as well as culture in general.  

In brief, in ''What is Literature'' Sartre called upon the writer's and reader's commitment to not only their own, but also the human freedom but of others.  In ''Writing Degree Zero'' Barthes explored this idea of commitment through a concern with form.  Barthes's &quot;notion of writing concerns that which is communicated outside or beyond any message or content&quot;. &lt;ref name=Allen1&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, G.|date=2003|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Barthes, writing in its extreme form is &quot;anticommunication.&quot;  

Barthes was also a cultural theorist. His thoughts are affected by existentialism, Marxism, structuralism and psychoanalysis. He developed these philosophical  ideas and theories, and in turn had influence on later theorists. He was impressed in particular by Saussure, Levi-Strauss, Marx, and Jacques Lacan. 

As Moriarty (1991) says, the label &quot;theorist&quot; as applied to Barthes is still reductive. With journalistic passion, his activity as a theorist of semiology moves into popular culture.  His style as an essayist adopted other forms.  He evolved a writing style that adopted both novelistic styles and critical or political discourse.  Even if his writings do not resemble a typical novel, they offer everything the reader might desire from a novel. (Moriarty, 1991, p.5)  

Barthes did not establish any specific theory, but he can be considered as an important thinker positioned between structuralism and post-structuralism.  It is not only because of his multilateral intellectual activities but also his continuous reflexive and critical consciousness about &quot;right here&quot; where he belonged; as a &quot;New Leftist&quot; he said that he was both &quot;Sartrian and Marxist,&quot; which means &quot;existential Marxist&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wasserman2&gt;{{cite book|author=Wasserman, G.R.|date=1981|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co.|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was critical about the platitudinous and depthless criticism against bourgeois literature; as a poststructuralist, he tried to overcome the limitations in structuralism.

== Influenced by Saussure and Lévi-Strauss ==

=== Saussure and Barthes ===

Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure's structural linguistics.  To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. &quot;Langue is the systematized set of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language&quot; (Barthes, 1967, p.13).  Barthes interprets Saussure's linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level, langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized. On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However, it is considered 'relatively' flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the shared convention, the structure. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A language is therefore, ­a social institution and a system of values.  It is the social part of language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one wishes to communicate.  It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social institution.  In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially an individual act of selection and actualization.  The speaking subject can use the code of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought.  It is because speech is essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure creation.
(Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form. The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word 'dog' in English or 'gae' in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified.  &quot;I propose to retain the word sign (signe) to designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that separates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts&quot; (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p. 37).

The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation.   It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that &quot;language does not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barker67&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Saussure, &quot;meaning is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic (e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system&quot; (Barker, 2002, p. 29).  As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntagmatic comprises a sentence, and the
paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, let's consider the following sentence: &quot;I went to a theater with my girlfriend.&quot; This sentence is established through the linear combination of signs.  The signs within the example, such as I theater, my, and girlfriend can be substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as &quot;She went to a restaurant with her mother.&quot;  Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when they are related to each other. &quot;Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other.  Thus, meaning is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs&quot; (Barker, C., 2002, p. 29).

&quot;It is central to Saussure's argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context. Thus, traffic lights deploy 'red' to signify 'stop,' and 'green' to signify 'go.'  This is the cultural code of traffic systems which temporally fixes the relationship between colours and meanings.  Signs become naturalized codes. The apparent transparency of meaning (we know when to stop or go) is an outcome of cultural habituation, the effect of which is to conceal the practices of cultural coding&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barker68&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Barker explains, even though there might be infinite possibilities to change the relation between the signified and the signifier due to its arbitrariness, this relationship is limited and stabilized through consensus within the particular social and historical contexts. Even though Saussure's study itself is limited to linguistics, it suggests the possibility of the study of culture as signs.  Barthes is one of the most popular scholars who expanded Saussure's concepts to interpreting cultural phenomenon as &quot;codes.&quot;

=== Lévi-Strauss ===

Lévi-Strauss is another structuralist who influenced Barthes.  Lévi-Strauss was an anthropologist who applied Saussure's theory to anthropological areas of study, such as kinship.  &quot;Although they belong to another order of reality, kinship phenomena are of the same type as linguistic phenomena&quot; (Lévi-Struass, 1963, in R. Innis, p.113).  Lévi-Strauss accepted Saussure's idea that &quot;Language (langue), on the contrary to speech (language), is a self-contained whole and a principle of classification. As soon as we give language first place among the facts of speech, we introduce a natural order into a mass that lends itself to no other classification the norm of all other manifestations of speech&quot; (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis (ed.), p.29).  He went further, however, by conceptualizing language itself as the production of its society.

Like Saussure, Lévi-Strauss focused on the structure of language, and sought to find the hidden structures that he believed to exist in archetypes.  Based on the laws of language underlying speech, he specifically tried to uncover the underlying substructure of various cultural phenomena such as customs, rites, habits, and gestures - &quot;phenomena which themselves said to be intrinsic to the creation of language&quot; (Kurzweil, 1982, p. 64).   He also examined the underlying structure of the myth.  &quot;Its substance does not lie in its style, its original music, or its syntax, but in the story which it tells.  Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps on rolling&quot; (Lévi-Strauss, 1955, in H. Adams &amp; L. Searle (Eds.), p. 811).

Kurzweil (1982) indicates that Barthes questioned why the dimensions of time often become irrelevant for creative writers.  This question is very similar to that of Lévi-Strauss, who wrote, &quot;With myth, everything becomes possible.  But on the other hand, this apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity between myths collected in widely different regions.&quot;  Lévi-Strauss (1955) explains this problem, &quot;Therefore the problem: If the content of a myth is contingent, how are we going to explain the fact that myths throughout the world are so similar?&quot; (p. 810).  It seems natural that Barthes was attracted to Lévi-Strauss's findings of the similarities between tribal myths in discrete cultures, as well as between structural elements in the lives and tales of diverse tribes.

Through his work, Lévi-Strauss believed that there would be one universal system connecting all myths and all societies.  Barthes, despite not being a Marxist, but working as a scholar who wanted to reveal the false notions in petite-bourgeois ideology, adopted Levi-Strauss's systemic approach (Kurzweil, E., 1982, p. 64-69).  He expected to analyze all past and future creative acts and works through the language their authors used, and argued that these authors were no more than expressions of their times and societies (Kurzweil, E., 1982, pp. 64-69).

=== Barthes goes further ===

Barthes was able to expand upon the work of these scholars.  His classified concepts, such as Language and Speech, Signified and Signifier, Syntagm and System, Denotation and Connotation (Barthes, 1968, trans. Cape, J., p. 12) expanded on Saussure's work.  For example, he added the concept of &quot;the motivated&quot; as the middle concept between &quot;the icon&quot; as only one functional meaning and &quot;the arbitrary&quot; as infinite possible meanings.  &quot;The motivated is carefully defined by accepted conventions; national flags or uniforms are begin to merge into the motivated when they give rise to the wearing of civilian clothes that have a complex but nevertheless very clear set of associations in the particular society in which they have grown up.&quot; &lt;ref name=Thody97&gt;{{cite book|author=Thody, P.|date=1997|title=Introducing Barthes|location=New York|publisher=Totem Books|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, while Lévi-Strauss sought for the universality throughout all different kinds of myths, Barthes emphasized on the potential of difference as a role of language, especially in his later thought.  Barthes thus becomes a link between structuralism and post-structuralism.

== Barthes and mass communication ==

In Communication Studies, the reason Roland Barthes can be considered an important scholar is that he applied linguistic rules to general cultural codes, from a magazine &quot;text&quot; to an &quot;image&quot; in
advertisements.  His approach to cultural products becomes a good
example in today's Cultural Studies, Critical Communication and various
semiotic analyses of media programs or in Visual Communication field.

Books most related to media culture among Barthes's writings are
Elements of Semiology (1964), the Fashion System (1967) and Mythologies (1957). These are perhaps the most &quot;structuralistic&quot; of his works.

=== Elements of Semiology ===

''Elements of Semiology'' does not analyze popular culture directly.  Rather, Barthes shows his critical interest in mass culture, writing about the value of semiological analyses of mass cultural products in an era of mass communication.   &quot;The development of mass communications confers particular relevance today upon the vast field of signifying media, just when the success of disciplines such as linguistics, information theory, formal logic and structural anthropology provide semantic analysis with new instruments&quot; (Barthes, 1964, p. 9).

With ''Elements of Semiology'', Barthes introduced four classifications of the elements that create the process of semiological analysis.  These classifications are borrowed from structural linguistics, and consist of the categories of language and speech, signified and signifier, syntagm and system, and denotation and connotation (Barthes, 1964).

; Language and Speech : Barthes (1964) applied the concepts of language, or the part of the semiological system which is agreed upon by society, and speech, or the individual selection of symbols, to semiological systems.  The application of these concepts can be applied to the semiological study of the food system.  According to Barthes (1964), a person is free to create their own menu, using personal variations in food combinations, and this will become their speech or message.  This is done with the overall national, regional, and social structures of the language of food in mind (Barthes, 1964).  Barthes (1964) then expanded on Saussure’s terms, by explaining that language is not really socially determined by the masses, but is sometimes determined by a small group of individuals, somewhat changing the relationship of language and speech.  Barthes (1964) claims that a semiological system can essentially exist in which there is language, but little or no speech.  In this case, Barthes (1964) believes that a third element called matter, which would provide signification, would need to be added to the language/speech system.  

; Signifier and Signified : For Saussure (1959), the signified was a representation of a concept, while the signifier was used to represent the sound-image of that concept.  Barthes (1964) points out that the importance of both the signified and the signifier is the relationship between them; it is within this relationship that meaning is created.  “…that the words in the field derive their meaning only from their opposition to one another (usually in pairs), and that if these oppositions are preserved, the meaning is unambiguous” (Barthes, 1964, p. 38).  Out of this relationship, the sign is created.  Saussure (1959)  considered the sign to be arbitrary in nature, based primarily on the relationship between the signified and the signifier.  Barthes (1964) explained that the sign can no longer be arbitrary when semiological systems are considered.  Instead, Barthes shows that once a sign takes on a function or use, it will gain its own meaning in the process.  “…as soon as there is a society, every usage is converted into a sign of itself” (Barthes, 1964, p. 41).  The sign can actually lose its arbitrary nature and become motivated (Barthes, 1964).

; Syntagm and System : Barthes (1964) defines the syntagm as a linear combination of signs.  Within semantic analyses, this would be something like a sentence, where each term is related to the other terms within the phrase (Barthes, 1964).  The syntagm is compared to the system, which explains associations on the same level, such as how certain words relate to the meaning of other words within our minds, as in the case of the relations between “education” and “training” (Barthes, 1964, p. 58).  Barthes expands upon these ideas by applying them semiologically to various systems, including food.  With food, the systematic level becomes the various dishes within a particular category (i.e. types of desserts), whereas the syntagmatic level becomes the menu choices selected for a full meal (Barthes, 1964).  

; Denotation and Connotation : The terms denotation and connotation were used by Barthes for examining the relationships between systems.  Each semiological system can be thought of as consisting of an expression, a plane of content, and a relation between the two (Barthes, 1964).  A connotation then examines how one system can act as a signifier of this first relation, specifically how it represents the expression within the first system (Barthes, 1964).  These elements were particularly useful for examining relations between systems of symbols, rather than just relations between elements.

Despite the theoretical discussion, ''Elements of Semiology'' offers Barthes's own interpretation about the political or existential conditions. He recommends a &quot;total ideological description&quot; (Barthes, 1964, p. 46) of the culture to &quot;rediscover the articulations which men impose on reality&quot; (Barthes, 1964, p.57).  &quot;Semiology will describe how reality is divided up, given meaning and then 'naturalized' (Barthes, pp. 63-4), as if culture
were nature itself.&quot; (Rylance, 1994, p. 38)

=== The Fashion System ===

Barthes most bitterly denounces consumerism in the Fashion System.  &quot;In the Fashion System, he asked how the fashion model
projects what clothes are to be worn (and bought); what effect (of
luxury and availability to all) the expensive production of the
magazines themselves produces on readers; how color, texture, belts, or hats, depending upon their combination, transmit messages in relation to morning or evening activities; and how we thereby learn that there are rules of dress for every occasion-rules that parallel the transformations and oppositions we know in language.  Barthes expected to reconstruct all the social implications, codes, and messages hidden in the literature on fashion&quot; (Kurzweil, E., 1982, p. 72).

Although this work is worthwhile in that the fashion magazine of mass culture can be analyzed with the same method as the so-called high culture is, Barthes failed to distinguish the commercial and the popular. Kurzweil (1982) indicates that Barthes also failed to distinguish between what is just sold and what people actually do with it, i.e., what people do with consumer goods, apart from buying them.(p.75) This negative attitude toward mass culture and consumerism was a common tendency of leftist intellectuals in Europe at that time.  It also helps explain why intellectuals at that time called cultural products mass culture, and not popular culture.

=== Mythologies ===

''Mythologies'' is a compilation of a series of articles, which were originally published in the magazine ''Les Lettre Nouvelles'' between 1953 and 1956. Even if it is not a theoretical work, it is perhaps the most influential of all Barthes's writings, particularly in relation to Communication Studies.  Barthes's biographer even suggests that in France, ''Mythologies'' influenced not just journalists and critics, but novelists and the film-makers of the &quot;New Wave,&quot; especially Godard (Rylance, R., 1994, p.43).

In ''Mythologies'', inconsistent subjects, such as wrestling, photographs, film or wine are all treated as myth.  These diverse subjects can be bound together, as Barthes did not intend to talk about the subjects themselves, but to show how their underlying messages can be circulated and naturalized.  The subjects treated in ''Mythologies'' share a similar circulation process within mass culture.

For example, professional wrestling carries two messages, &quot;wrestling as sport&quot; and &quot;wrestling as spectacle&quot;.&lt;ref name=Thody97/&gt;  Barthes compares professional wrestling with Greek theater to demonstrate that audiences are not so much interested in athletic contests as they are in a cathartic, Manichean performance.   These double messages are shared by the audience as well.  Audiences are not only accustomed to the conventions of wrestling but also take pleasure out of the double nature of wrestling.  Barthes reflects that a wrestling match is not merely an aesthetic act but has ideological significance as well, just as is the case with the realistic art enjoyed by the petit-bourgeois.

In the case of wine, he argues that the wine is signified as of
Frenchness or of virility in French culture but in fact, the image of wine is a mystification.  Knowledge about types of wine obscures the fact that wine is not so different from other commodities produced under capitalism, and lands in North Africa and Muslim laborers, neither of which are of Frenchness, are exploited in its production.

Barthes (1972) also examplified the advertisement of soap in order to show such mystification 
The advertisement compares two brands with each other and sheds light on the issue of selection between two brands as a 
matter of importance.  It blurs the fact that both brands are actually produced by the same multinational company.
Through these examples in mass culture, he suggests the consistent argument that &quot;a message is read into some substance, custom or
attitude that seemed to carry its own justification in terms purely of practical use.  The message thus revealed turns out to be concealing the operation of socio-economic structures that require to be denounced, both because they are concealing their identity and because that identity is inherently exploitative&quot; (Mortiary, 1991, p. 21).

=== &quot;Myth Today&quot; in ''Mythologies'' ===

As the concluding chapter in ''Mythologies'', &quot;Myth Today&quot; combines the various cases into a unified theoretical idea.  Here, Barthes
conceptualizes myth as &quot;a system of communication, that it is a message cannot be possibly be an object, a concept, or an idea; it is a mode of signification, a form&quot; (Barthes, 1972, p. 109)  Also, he analyzes the process of myth concretely, presenting specific examples.

Based on Saussure's definitions, Barthes argues that signification can be separated into denotation and connotation.  &quot;Denotation is the descriptive and literal level of meaning shared by most of members within a culture; connotation, on the other hand, is the meaning generated by connecting signifiers to the wider cultural concerns, such as the beliefs, attitudes, frameworks and ideologies of a social formation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barker69&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myth is the signification in connotative level.  &quot;Where connotation has become naturalized as hegemonic, that is, accepted as normal and natural, is acts as conceptual maps of meaning by which to make sense of the world. These are myth.&quot; &lt;ref name=Barker69/&gt;  If a certain sign is adopted repetitiously in the syntagmatical dimension, this particular adoption is seen as more suitable than applications of other alternatives in the paradigmatic.  Then, the connotation of the sign becomes naturalized and normalized.  Naturalization of myth is nothing but a cultural construct.

Myth is &quot;a second-order semiological system. That which is a sign in the first system (namely the associative total of a concept and an image) becomes a mere signifier in the second&quot; (Barthes, 1972, p. 114)  Barthes defines the sign in the first-order system, or language, as the language-object, and the myth as metalanguage.

In order to advance his argument, he uses two examples, that of a sentence in Latin grammar textbook and a photograph of a black
soldier.  The signified of the sentence and the photograph in the first-order system disappears when the sign becomes the form for the concept in the second-order system.  The sentence loses its own story and becomes just a grammatical example.  The factual discourse about the young black soldier is also obscured by the lack of context concerning French imperialism.  According to Barthes's table (Barthes, 1972, trans. A. Leavers, p. 115), the examples can be drawn like below.

The signification of myth deletes the history or narrative of the sign and fills up the empty space with the intentioned new meaning.  &quot;Myth is thus not just a message, but a message that is political by depoliticizing. It turns history into essence, culture into Nature, and obscures the role of human beings in producing the structures they inhabit and thus their capacity to change them&quot; (Moriarty, 1991, p. 28)

=== Rhetoric of the Image ===

As Barthes says in Mythologies, &quot;We must here recall that the materials of mythical speech (the language itself, photography, painting, posters, rituals, objects, etc.), however different at the start, are reduced to a pure signifying function as soon as they are caught by myth&quot; (Barthes, 1972, p. 114).  He applies his semiological analysis into other visual materials. For instance, in the Panzani advertisement analyzed in &quot;Rhetoric of the Image,&quot; he analyzes three kinds of message: a linguistic message, a coded iconic message, and a non-coded iconic message (the cultural message). He also reflects about the relationship between linguistic message and image.  He devised the concepts of &quot;anchorage&quot; which is the faculty for the linguistic message to control the meaning of the image, and &quot;relay,&quot; the supportive relationship of text and image.  Anchorage and relay are useful conceptual tools in analyzing media products such as news, advertisements, or soap operas.

== &quot;Lived in the plural&quot; ==

=== Shift to post-structuralism ===

According to many commentators, by the end of the 1960s, Barthes's work shifted from structuralism to post-structuralism.  Although it can be valued in that it turns theoretical reorientation from the value of the individual unit towards system, function and structure, structuralism has been criticized due to its methodological limitations.  Two of the main problems of structuralism were that the overemphasis on how to function results in the negligence of reflection on history or value-judgment, and also that it ignores the individual agency-parole, pragmatic etc., focusing too much on structure or system-langue, syntagmatic.  As a result, the post-structuralism school began to challenge the &quot;objectivity&quot; which was assumed in language as &quot;a reliable yardstick for the measurement of other signifying system,&quot; even though they agreed with the argument of structuralism that &quot;analysis of language is central to any modern intellectual project&quot; (Rylance, 1994, p. 66)

As Rylance (1994) says, &quot;Barthes's structuralism, as well as resuming earlier themes, contains a number of his later anti-structuralist positions.&quot;(p.32)  For example, &quot;despite his agreement with Saussure's concepts, 'langue' and 'parole' in ''Elements of Semiology'' (1964), Barthes casts doubt on their limitation; he realizes that it also downgrades individual language use and the model is undeviatingly controlling which langue controls parole, asking 'if everything in langue is so rigid, how does change or new work come about?'&quot; (Rylance, 1991, p. 40).  Barthes was consistently aware of problems of structuralism and eventually gave up parts of it in his later works.

&quot;Instead of having one stable denotive meaning, signs are said by the later Barthes to be polysemic, that is, they carry many potential meanings.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barker71&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker, C.|date=2000|title=Cultural studies: Theory and practice|location=London|publisher=Sage|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later days, Barthes difinitely emphasized in the difference rather than focusing on
repetition. He focuses more on the text, aware of the cleavage between writer and writing.

His shift can be understood as a rethinking of the biased preposition of the language systems.  &quot;Despite his anti-idealist view of the subject as a product of cultural forces rather than an origin, his hedonistic idea of the body in Pleasure of the Text (1975) re-centers the self as a transhistorical source of meaning.&quot; (Haney, 1989, in Semiotica, p. 313)  This admits the relative autonomy of the parole from the langue. At the same time, it opens the plurality of meaning.  This is revealed in his discussion about writing and reading.

=== Writing and Reading ===

Barthes argues that writing lies in between the historical and the personal.  The text is thus the interplay between the writer's freedom and society.  &quot;A language and a style are data prior to all problematic of language; but the formal identity of the writer is truly established only outside of permanence of grammatical norms and stylistic constraints.  It thus commits the writer to manifest and communicate a state of happiness or malaise, and links the form of his utterance, which is at once normal and singular, to the vast History of the Others&quot; (Barthes, 1968, p.14; Haney, W. 1989, p. 319)

His thought about reading further expands the potential of meaning.  He separates reading into two categories, the &quot;writerly/scriptable&quot; and the &quot;readerly/legible.&quot;  The writerly reading means that a reader participates actively in producing meanings as if he/she re-writes the text.  &quot;The text which makes this activity possible resists being appropriated by paraphrase or critical commentary because it escapes conventional categories of genre, and hence cannot be read as a representation, cannot even be reduced to a structure.&quot; (Moriarty, 1991, p. 118)  A reader finds pleasure from reading the writerly text.  The readerly text is opposite to the writerly, which makes the reader passive in interpreting the text.

=== Camera Lucida ===

The pleasure of interpretation by the interplay between langue and parole or the history and the individual creation is also applied to his speculation about photography.  ''Camera Lucida'' a meditation on the photographic, was to be his last work.  In this Barthes examined two elements that for him comprised the meaning of image, the studium and the punctum. The studium of a photograph presents meanings which are culturally coded, and corresponds to the photograph's symbolic meaning.  The punctum, on the other hand, disturbs the obvious meaning in photographs.  It &quot;puntuates&quot; the meaning of the photograph.  For example, in a Lewis Hine photo, Barthes points to a girl's bandaged finger, and a boy's collar.  The problem, as Barthes was aware, is that when Barthes points out these details, they move from the status of punctum to that of studium.&lt;ref name=Allen2&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, G.|date=2003|title=Roland Barthes|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|pages=126-127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

As the writerly reading touches the creative participation of readers in interpreting the text, the image also can be the writerly text which arouses the pleasure of interpretation of appreciator thanks to puctum. According to Barthes, studium is always coded, while punctum is not.

Even though they retain their heterogeneity to each other, they are not opposed to each other. The &quot;subtle beyond&quot; of the punctum, the uncoded beyond, exists with the &quot;always coded&quot; of the stadium. (Derrida, 1981, in Knight, 2000, pp. 130-131)

== Conclusion ==

Roland Barthes had lived with his mother for much of his life.  After her death in 1977 he reflected, &quot;From now on I could do no more than await my total, undialectical death&quot; (cited in Allen, 2003, 134).  In March of 1980 he was struck by a laundry truck, and died after a month in hospital.  

Barthes's thought is inter-related with the arguments of other post-structuralists.  Later in his career Barthes sought to define langue and parole as discrete but intermingled entities.  The interplay of the contradictory elements happens between writer and history, text and audience, or the structured and the abrupt widens the horizon of meaning.  

Barthes is enigmatic in that both the focus of his work and writing style are hard to concretely define.  He &quot;lived in the plural&quot; (Derrida, 1981, in D. Knight, (ed.), p. 132)  As Todorov (1981) commented, &quot;No one would ever again think of Barthes as a semiologist, a sociologist, a linguist, even though he might have lent his voice to each of those figures in succession; nor would they think of him as philosopher or a 'theorist'&quot; (in D. Knight (ed.) p. 125).  Barthes nonetheless was a semiologist, sociologist, linguist and a theorist.

Barthes is important to the field of Critical Communication in that he applied a semiological approach to media culture.  His thought can also be regarded as a foundation for empirical research about the relationship between messages and audiences, in that he argued for the plurality of the message meaning produced through the interwork of structure and agency.

== Introduction ==

Transfer of information from one place to another faces many difficulties. Principal among them is ''noise''. For example suppose 01010101 is sent from one end. Due to noise, it may be received as 11010101, with the first digit changed by noise. Clearly if what is sent is not what is received, communication can be problematic. Error correcting codes have been developed to solve this type of problem.

In practical applications it makes sense to send messages in ''blocks'', i.e. a series of digits one after another, e.g. 11111100. It is well known that electronic data are represented using 0's and 1's. Each digit (0 or 1) is called a bit. A byte is made up of 8 bits. A byte allows us to represent &lt;math&gt;2^8 = 256&lt;/math&gt; symbols. Let's suppose for the moment that data is sent a byte at time. As before, due to noise that is sent may not always be what is received.

Computer scientists came up with a simple error detection method called ''parity check''. With this method, we represent data using only the first 7 bits. The last bit is always chosen so that together with the other seven there are an even number of 1's in the byte. When the data arrives at the other end, the receiver counts the number of 1's in the byte. If it's odd, then the byte must have been contaminated by noise so the receiver may ask for retransmission.

This method only ''detects'' errors but it can not correct them other than ask for retransmission. If retransmission is expensive (e.g. satellite), parity check is not ideal. Also its error detection ability is very low. If two bits were changed by noise, then the receiver will assume the message is correct. More sophisticated error correction codes address these problems.

== Hamming Code ==
Hamming code is an ''improvement'' on the parity check method. It can ''correct'' 1 error but at a price. In the parity check scheme, the first 7 bits in a byte are actual information so &lt;math&gt;2^7 = 128 &lt;/math&gt; different symbols may be represented using a byte. But for Hamming code each block of data contains 7 bits (not 8) and only 4 bits in a block are used to represent data, so only &lt;math&gt;2^4 = 16&lt;/math&gt; symbols may be represented in a block. Therefore, to send the same amount of info in Hamming code, we will need to send a lot more bits. Anyhow let's see how Hamming Code works.

In this section we will see that Hamming code has some amazing properties, although we will not discuss why it works just yet. In fact, if only one error is introduced in transmission, i.e. only one bit got changed, then the decoding method employed by the receiver will definitely be able to correct it. It is easy to appreciate then, that if 2 or more errors are made, correction and even detection may not be possible.

For now, we will describe how Hamming code works, but only later do we develop the mathematics behind it. Therefore, this section can be skipped if one wishes.

We let each of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' take the value 0 or 1, and these are called information bits. A Hamming code is a block of 7 bits in the form of
:(a + b + d, a + c + d, a, b + c + d, b, c, d) (mod 2)
''..give matrix repn''
as can be seen, the digits ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' appear on their own in component 3, 5, 6, and 7. All other components are a combination of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d''. So we call the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th component the information component, all other components are ''check'' components, and these components carry extra information that allows us to detect and correct single errors. We will explain the funny notation above in turn. The (mod 2) notation means that we take each of the values in the bracket, separated by commas, and look at its value modular 2 (we will see an example later).

We have represented the block of 7 bits in vector form, where each component corresponds to a bit. E.g. let ''a'' = ''b''= ''c'' = ''d'' = ''1'', then we have
:(1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1, 1 , 1 + 1 + 1, 1, 1, 1) (mod 2)
which is
:(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
therefore 1111111 is the block of bits we are sending.

To detect single errors, it's also very simple. Suppose the codeword received is &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_7&lt;/math&gt;, we compute 3 values
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_2 + a_3 + a_6 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
then we declare the error is at the &lt;math&gt;2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0&lt;/math&gt;th position.

Suppose 1111111 is sent but 1111011 is received. The receiver computes
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 1\pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 0\pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 1\pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
so the error is at the &lt;math&gt;2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0 = 4 + 1 = 5&lt;/math&gt;th position as predicted!

If no error is made in transmission, then &lt;math&gt;2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

''' Summary '''&lt;br/&gt;
If one wishes to send a block of information consisting of 4 bits. Let these 4 bits be ''abcd'', say.
* '''To send:''' ''abcd''
:* we compute and send (a + b + d, a + c + d, a, b + c + d, b, c, d) (mod 2)
* '''To decode:'''
:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_1 = a_2 + a_3 + a_6 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_2 = a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 \pmod2&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;e = 2^2{b_2} + 2{b_1} + b_0&lt;/math&gt;
:if ''e'' = 0 then assume no error, otherwise declare a single error occurred at the ''e''th position.

=== Exercise ===
''...compute some codewords and decode them''

== Basics ==
The mathematical theory of error correcting codes applies the notion of a ''finite field'', called also ''Galois field'' (after the famous French mathematician, Evariste Galois, 1811-1832). In particular, the 2-element set {0,1} supports the structure of a finite field of size 2. In general, a finite field may have ''q'' elements, where ''q'' is a prime power (no other number of elements is possible in a finite field; any two finite fields with the same number of elements  are ''essentially'' alike, i.e. ''isomorphic''). E.g. a 7-element field may consist of elements 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and its arithmetic operations + - * are performed modulo 7.

We denote the finite field of size ''q'' as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; or GF(q). GF stands for Galois Field.

=== Some Definitions ===

'''Code &amp; Codeword'''
:Let ''A'' be a finite set, called ''alphabet''; it should have at least two different elements. Let ''n'' be a natural number. A code of length ''n'' over alphabet ''A'' is any set ''C''  of n-long sequences of elements from ''A''; the sequences from ''C'' are called ''codewords'' of ''C''.

If alphabet ''A'' = {0,1} then codes over ''A'' are called binary.

For example, let ''C'' be a code over alphabet ''A'' := GF(5) := {0,1,2,3,4}. Let ''C'' := {000,111,222,333,444}. It has codewords 000, 111, 222, 333 and 444.

Now we should discuss some properties of a code. Firstly, we can have the notion of ''distance'' between two codewords.

'''Hamming Distance'''
:Let ''C'' be a code, and '''''x''''' and '''''y''''' ('''bold''' to signify that each codeword is like a vector) are codewords of ''C''. The Hamming distance of '''''x''''' and '''''y''''' denoted
::d('''''x''''','''''y''''')
:is the number places in which '''''x''''' and '''''y''''' differ.

E.g. d(000,111) = 3.

Hamming distance enjoys the following three fundamental metric properties:

# d('''''x''''','''''y''''') = 0 &lt;==&gt; ''''x'''' = ''''y''''
# d('''''x''''','''''y''''') = d('''''y''''','''''x''''')
# d('''''x''''','''''y''''') &amp;le; d('''''x''''','''''z''''') + d('''''z''''','''''y'''''); triangle inequality

'''Minimum distance'''
:The minimum distance of a code ''C'' denoted d(''C'') is the minimum distance possible between two different codewords of ''C''

E.g. Let ''C'' = {000,111,110,001}, then d(C) = d(000,001) = 1, as the distance between any other codewords are greater than or equal to 1.

=== The significance of minimum distance ===
The minimum distance of a code ''C'' is closely related to its ability to correct errors. Let's illustrate why, using a hypothetical code ''C''. Let say this code has minimum distance 5, i.e. d(''C'') = 5. If a codeword, '''x''' is sent and only up to 2 errors were introduced in transmission, then it can be ''corrected''.

Suppose '''x''' is sent but '''x''' + '''e''' is received, where '''e''' corresponds to some vector with up to 2 non-zero components. We see that '''x''' + '''e''' is closer to '''x''' than any other codeword! This is due to the fact that d(''C'') = 5.

E.g. let ''C'' = {00000,11111,22222} and 00000 is sent but 00012 is received. It is easy to see that 00000 is the closet codeword to 00012. So we decode 00012 as 00000, we have in effect corrected 2 errors. But if 3 or more errors are made and we decode using the closest codeword, then we might be in trouble. E.g. if  11111 is sent but 11222 is received. We decode 11222 as 22222, but this is wrong!

No error correcting code is ''perfect'' (although we call some ''perfect codes''). No code can correct every possible error vector. But it is also reasonable to assume that only a small number of errors are made each transmission and so we only need codes that can correct a small number of errors.

=== Nearest Neighbour decoding ===
If ''m'' &amp;gt; ''n'', then it is reasonable to assume that it is more likely that ''n'' errors were made than ''m'' errors. In any communication channel, it is reasonable to assume that ''the more errors, the less likely''. Therefore it is very reasonable to decode a received block using nearest neighbour decoding, i.e. if '''y''' is received, we look for a codeword '''x''' (of ''C'') so that d(''x'',''y'') is minimum.

Using the above scheme, it is easy to see that if a code ''C'' has minimum distance d(''C'') = 2''t'' + 1, then up to ''t'' errors can be corrected.

==== Exercises ====
If a code ''C'' has minimum distance d(''C'') = 2''t'' + 2. How many errors can it correct using nearest neighbour decoding?

== Linear Codes ==
''Basic linear algebra assumed from here on.''&lt;br&gt;
'''Notation'''
:Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{GF}(q)^n&lt;/math&gt; both denote the ''n''-dimensional vector space with components coming from {1,2,..,''q'' - 1} with arithmetic performed modulo ''q''

A linear code ''C'' is a ''q''-ary [''n'',''k'',''d''] code, if
# ''C'' is a set of vectors of length ''n'',
# each component (of a codeword) takes a value from GF(''q''),
# all the codewords of ''C'' are spanned by ''k'' linearly indepedent vectors, and
# d(''C'') = ''d''

Note that if ''x'' and ''y'' are codewords then so is ''x'' + ''y''. In other words, we can think of ''C'' as a vector-subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q^n = GF(q)^n&lt;/math&gt;, of dimension ''k''. So ''C'' can be completely determined by providing a basis of ''k'' vectors that span the codewords. Let {&lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; | ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., k} be a basis for ''C'', we call the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;G= \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\\ ...\\ v_k\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
the generator matrix of ''C''.

E.g. let ''C'' be a ''5''-ary [5,3,3] code spanned by {10034,01013,00111} then the generator matrix is
:&lt;math&gt;G= \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;3&amp;4\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;3\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

''' Information rate'''&lt;br&gt;
A ''q''-ary [''n'',''k'',''d''] code can have &lt;math&gt;q^k&lt;/math&gt; different codewords as each codeword ''c'' is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;c = a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + .. + a_kv_k&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; may take values 0, 1, .., ''q'' - 1 (as arithmetic is performed modulo ''q''). So this code can represent &lt;math&gt;q^k&lt;/math&gt; symobols.

We see that the row span of ''G'' are all the codewords, so suppose one wants to send &lt;math&gt;c_1c_2..c_k&lt;/math&gt;, we can compute the corresponding codeword ''c'' by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \begin{pmatrix}c_1&amp;c_2&amp;..&amp;c_k\end{pmatrix}G&lt;/math&gt;

E.g. let ''C'' and ''G'' be as above and we wish to send 012 to the receiver, we compute the codeword
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;3&amp;4\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;3\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Notice how the first 3 digits of the codeword is actually the message we want to send, so the last 2 digits are not needed if we don't want any error-correction ability in the code.

A linear code is in ''standard form'' if it's generator matrix is of the form (''I''|''N'') (has an identiy matrix at the left end of the generator matrix). The matrix ''G'' above is in standard form. It turns out that if ''G'' is in standard then it's easy for the receiver to read the intended message. It has another advantage which will be discussed in the next section.

==== Decoding ====
One advantage of using linear code is that ''detection'' of errors is easy. Actually, we can find a matrix ''H'' such that &lt;math&gt;H\underline{x}^T=\underline0&lt;/math&gt; ''if and only if'' '''x''' is a codeword. So if '''y''' is received and &lt;math&gt;H\underline{y}^T \ne \underline{0}&lt;/math&gt; then we can confidently say that '''y''' has been contaminated by noise.

To find such a ''H'', let's suppose ''C'' is a ''q''-ary [''n'',''k'',''d''] code and ''C'' is spanned by &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; ''i'' = 1, 2, .., ''k''.

'''Definition -- Inner Product &amp; Orthogonality'''&lt;br&gt;
Define the ''inner product'' of any two vectors to be
:&lt;math&gt;&lt;(x_1,x_2,..,x_n),(w_1,w_2,..,w_n)&gt; = x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + .. + x_kw_k \ \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;
we say two vectors '''v''' and '''w''' are orthogonal if &lt;'''v''','''w'''&gt; = 0.

E.g. let ''C'' be a 7-ary [7,4,3] code, then
:&lt;(0,1,2,4,5,6,3), (1,4,5,0,3,2,0)&gt; = 4 + 10 + 15 + 12 = 41 &amp;equiv; 6 (mod 7)

Firstly note that ''H'' must be a ''n'' by ''j'' matrix for some ''j''. Think of ''H'' as a linear transformation in &lt;math&gt;GF(q)^n&lt;/math&gt;. By definition ker''H'' = C, and by the rank-nullity theorom
:&lt;math&gt;n = dim(imH) + k&lt;/math&gt;
so ''H'' has rank ''n'' - ''k''. In fact, the row span of ''H'' is the span of ''n'' - ''k'' linearly independent vectors, &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; ''i'' = 1,2,..,''n'' - ''k'' where &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal to each codeword in ''C''.

Notice that ''C'' = im''H'' and ker''H'' are vectors subspaces (exercise). In fact we denote
:&lt;math&gt;kerH = C^\bot&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C^\bot&lt;/math&gt; means the vector subspace where any vector is orthogonal to every vector in ''C''.

So we need to find a basis for &lt;math&gt;C^\bot&lt;/math&gt; and let ''H'' be the matrix whose rows the the basis vectors! If the generator matrix ''G'' of ''C'' is in standard form, then ''H'' is very easy to compute. Indeed if
:&lt;math&gt;G = (I_k | N) \!&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;H = (-N^T | I_{n-k}) \!&lt;/math&gt;

For example, let ''G'' be as above i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;G = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;3&amp;4\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;3\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
then we can conclude
:&lt;math&gt;H =
\begin{pmatrix}
-3&amp;-1&amp;-1&amp;1&amp;0\\
-4&amp;-3&amp;-1&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
look at the values modulo 5 (recall that ''G'' generates a 5-ary code), we get
:&lt;math&gt;H =
\begin{pmatrix}
2&amp;4&amp;4&amp;1&amp;0\\
1&amp;2&amp;4&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We call ''H'' the parity check matrix as ''H'' can tell us whether a code has been contamniated with.

To see that each codeword &lt;math&gt;Hx^T = 0&lt;/math&gt;, all we need to do if multiply ''H'' by each row of ''G'' (transposed) since the rows of ''G'' span ''C'' (exercise).

==== Exercises ====
1. Let ''H'' be the parity check matrix of a code ''C'', i.e. ''H'''''x'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = '''0''' for all codewords '''x''' of ''C''. Think of ''H'' as a linear transformation. Prove that  ''C'' = im''H'' and ker''H'' are vectors subspaces.

2. If ''G'' (the generator matrix) is in standard form, prove that ''H'' as constructed above is spanned by all the vectors orthogonal to the row span of ''G''.

== Why Hamming code works ==
The binary Hamming code is a [7,4,3] code. Since the minimum distance is 3, so it can correct 1 error. The Hamming code is special as it tells the receiver where the error is. To construct a Hamming code, it is easier to construct the parity check matrix first
:&lt;math&gt;H =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1\\
1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We will not discuss how to find ''G'', it is left as an exercise. Notice the ''columns'' of ''H'' are just the binary representation of the number 1,2,.., and 7 in increasing order. This is how Hamming code can tell us where the error is.

Let '''x''' be a codeword of the Hamming Code, and suppose '''x''' + '''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' is received, where '''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the vector where only the ''j''th position is 1. In other words, one error is made in the ''j''th position.

Now notice that
:&lt;math&gt;H(\underline x + \underline e_j)^T = H\underline x^T + H\underline e_j^T = \underline 0 + H\underline e_j^T = H\underline e_j^T&lt;/math&gt;
but &lt;math&gt;H\underline e_j^T&lt;/math&gt; is just the ''j'' column of ''H'' which is the binary representation of ''j''.</text>

=== What is a Tort? ===



A Tort is a civil wrong for which the law provides a remedy. A
''tortfeasor'' is considered to be ''liable'' for a tort, never
''guilty''; the word ''guilty'' is used in criminal law. The word came
into English from the latin ''tortus'' via French ''tort'', pronounced {{IPA|[tɔʀ]}}.

Someone tripping on a walkway, kids sending a baseball through a
window, a new Mercedes chipped by wood chips thrown from a lawnmover,
a tire blowing out on your car: they can all be examples of
torts. Some torts, such as sexual harassment, are ''also'' (in some
jurisdictions) criminal actions. (Note: at common law, this
usually means you can be hit with two cases, whereas in civil law
countries, especially in France, there often exists a preference for
attaching the tort suit to the criminal suit.)

=== What's the point? ===

Tort law exists to provide a relief for wrongs -- to &quot;make whole&quot;
those who are injured. As such it fulfills a moral role. Yet, tort law
also has a number of more practical purposes. It arose largely to
prevent people from doing what would be the natural thing in a society
without courts: revenge, or &quot;vigilante justice&quot;. Also, it exists to
as a deterrent towards potential tortfeasors from tortious action, and
to encourage responsible actions.

=== Torts and constitutions ===

Some constitutions, such as the Ohio State constitution,
specifically open courts to suits over damages to person, property, or
reputation. These rather obvious-sounding constitutional provisions
have become relevant lately as they can provide an impediment to
tort reform and proposed damage caps.

=== Example: a car crash ===

Suppose you end up in a car crash, and it is determined the crash was
due to somebody else's negligence. You may now try to lay claim to
various sorts of damages. First, there is physical injury. While the
question of assigning value to the human body has been contentious at
times (think connotations of slavery!), it is generally accepted that
monetary compensation can be assessed for physical injury in and of
itself. Similarly, you can these days claim emotional and mental
damages, which is a relatively new innovation, and to financial
injury, say, if you are no longer able to work for your
employer. Currently, it is not commonly possible to bring a tort
action for a ''purely'' financial injury; those are usually considered
more fit to be treated under the heading of contract law. Some
exceptions to that are malpractice in such professions as law and
accounting.

=== Sources of tort law ===

US tort law is primarily state-level common law. There
is little impact from statutes or from federal law.

=== The big question ===

How do we determine who should be compensated and how much? This is
the major question on which the study of the law of torts
focuses. There is no simple answer to it.

=== Insurance ===

You can insure yourself against some form of tortious liability. In
many jurisdictions, though, some forms of insurance may be
illegal. You cannot insure against, for instance, sexual harassment
damages (considered contrary to public policy), or punitive damages.

=== Crimes and torts ===

Crimes are a whole different can of worms from torts. Common law
crimes are rare these days, and in fact many common law jurisdictions,
including Ohio, have made it explicit that all crimes are
statutory. Criminal suits are brought by a public prosecutor in the
name of the ''public'' interest of society at large, and punishment is
viewed as the remedy. In a civil action, such as a tort action, both
parties are generally private actors, and the remedy comes in the form
of damages (payments of money), or occasionally injunctions, that is,
instructions by the court to perform or refrain from certain
actions. Occasionally, punitive damage are awarded that go beyond the
actual damage incurred. Punitive damages can be seen as a fuzzy areas
where tort law looks more like criminal law.

=== Theories of liability ===

There are three major kinds of liability: intentional acts,
unintentional/accidental acts, and acts for which there is ''strict
liability'', that is, you are liable for them regardless of whether
they are intentional. The latter category includes acts related to
some inherently dangerous activities, such as setting of fireworks.

=== Stages of a tort suit ===

Initially, the allegedly injured party files a complaint. In a
complaint, you set out theories of why you should win, and what your
claims are. There is no need initially to be very specific about how
exactly you are going argue the case, although you will have to choose
a specific recovery later on.

The second stage, a relatively new innovation in the common law, is
''discovery''. It is often the longest phase, and it exists to allow
the parties to get to know the other side's case. The key aspects of
discovery are depositions and interrogatories. Discovery is also when
pre-trial motions, such as motions to dismiss, are filed and decided
upon. Discovery prevents surprises during the actual trial.

The trial itself may or may not involve a jury. If neither party
requests a jury, both issues of fact and law will be decided by a
judge. If a jury is requested, the judge will restrict him/herself to
issues of law, and the jury decides on issues of fact. (Note that the
fact/law distinction is to some extent a technical and non-intuitive
one.)

Next comes the verdict, which may be rendered &quot;from the bench&quot; at
trial, or after some time. 

After the verdict, there is often an opportunity to appeal in a higher
court.

== History of torts ==

The most common view of the history of (common) tort law is that it
grew from those duties imposed upon actions that caused physical harm,
regardless of fault, and expanded from there to determine more refined
moral standards of general liability, but not everyone would agree.
Some early quotes are &quot;the thought of man shall not be tried for the
devil himself knoweth not the thought of man&quot; (Chief Justice Brian,
1468), and &quot;in all civil acts, the law doth not so much regard the
intent of the actor, as the loss and damage of the party suffering&quot;
(Lambert v. Bessey, 1681).

Early post-Norman England required writs, which cost money, in order
to bring a defendant to court. There were a limited number of very
specific writs. Local aristocracy would limit the writs that could be
issued to bring people to the King's court, largely because they wanted
to increase the power of the local courts.

Two writs of specific historic interest are the writ of trespass, and
the writ of action on the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Torts Casebook]] is intended to be a casebook treating the subject of [[Wikipedia:Tort|Torts]] much as would happen in a US law school. It is based on a series of podcasts ([http://www.lifeofalawstudent.com/]) by Neil Wehneman, which he has been recording as he attends law school.

The class that Neil is taking follows the traditional North-American format of legal education, where the students are supposed to discover the principles of law gradually as they study one or more historical cases for each lecture. It is therefore important to take such a course as a whole, lest you end up with an outdated or simplistic view of the law.

The podcasts themselves are under Creative Commons, but Neil has given explicit permission for use of his materials in GFDL'ed Wikimedia projects.

To help write this textbook, you can follow a very simple procedure:

* Listen to an episode of Neil's torts podcast
* Create a chapter of the book containing
** A link to the podcast
** Links to relevant source materials
** Links to relevant Wikipedia articles
** A summary (or elaboration) of the episode's contents

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depending on where you live there are many ways to supply water to your cattle.

== Dugouts, Slough, Ponds and other natural sources of water ==

There are several methods of handling this.  You can let the cattle drink from the water source naturally.  However, this will cause erosion and change the shape of the pond.  This can be beneficial at times especially for a dugout where minor erosion around the dugout will speed the process of naturalization and increase holding capacity.  However, this is often more harmful than beneficial and it is recommended by many sources that if you can afford it you install a solar or wind powered pump and fence off your water source.  With this set up you can water your herd from a trough and in northern climates can water them from this water source all year round (as long as the pump is below the maximum ice depth).

== Watering them in from a well or other man made source ==
For this you will need a trough and a hydrant or other form of a tap connected to a well.  If you are lucky and have a deep well or a separate well for your cattle then you can constantly water your herd without running out.  However, if you are sharing a shallow well with your herd and household water supply then you might run out of water if you need to supply too much.  If this is the case you may need to limit the size of your herd even more than local regulations may dictate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How do''' we''' define Marxism? ==

In defining Marxism a distinction has to be made between the writings and ideas of Karl Marx, the ideology of Marxism as a sociological perspective between his day and the present, and the politics of communism, socialism, and Labour’s third way. Textbooks on sociology often contrast social systems or structuralism with social action perspectives. They frequently then differentiate between consensus theories (like functionalism) and conflict theories (like Marxism or feminism). These distinctions may arise from the sociological cannon’s axiomatic reliance on a few key historical thinkers providing a basis for almost all modern development of the subject. 

== Who was Karl Marx? ==

Sociology can be thought of as a cannon of ideas and thought, stretching back into the nineteenth century. Its thinkers are “dependent on influences from elsewhere – they are not spontaneous individuals, geniuses who somehow spin their theories from thin air.” (Rob Stones 1998). Karl Marx (1818 – 1883) was a university educated German and was influenced by the philosopher Hegel, French revolutionary and socialist politics and English economics. Hegel’s writing provided a technical and theoretical basis for ideas concerning freedom, conflict and contradiction (dialectic logic) and man’s place in the world. This combined with the French tenets of Equality, Fraternity and Liberty along with the pragmatic analyses of economics in England by Adam Smith and David Ricardo. His friend, financier and collaborator Frederick Engels, led Marx to see conflict rather than consensus in society. At the age of 30 he published the Communist Manifesto (1848). He opens saying “the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle”. By the time he wrote Das Kapital (1867) he had become more focused on the reality of capitalism and the nature of class struggle (and therefore of society) than the trans-historical and inevitable overthrow of capitalist, antagonistic modes of production. It is important to remember the historical perspective; he lived in a world without television, in which England led the world towards industrialization. Imperial Britain had acquired a quarter of the planet (and its resources) so it is not hard to see why he thought that “as capitalism consolidates its hold around the globe, non-capitalist classes are eliminated and the proletariat expands…”

What resources are available and who controls them influences (almost deterministically) the nature of the superstructure, which is made up of all the non-economic articles of society, such as legal, religious and educational systems. Marxism divides the capitalist economic structure into two broad class strata; the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie own the means of production, land and factories and buy labour for wages from the proletariat. The proletariat having no means of subsistence themselves, have no choice but to sell their labour for wages to the bourgeoisie. Everyone needs the results of production, food, shelter and commodities. The scarcity of resources leads to a society primarily defined by its economics or infrastructure. In this way Marx thought that the economic base of society provided the foundation for all other features or functions of society, the superstructure. How and to whom the responsibility falls to of first, the funding, production and distribution of agriculture, and second, the provision of all other goods, determines the ruling class and their interests. They, of course, act using their overwhelming economic interests to consolidate their power politically (and culturally according to Gramsci), as well as economically. The legal system, nuclear family and even personal tastes and entertainment are shaped by the ruling class ideology and Marx’s description of capitalism in these terms vividly conveys the contradictions inherent in society. For example, he highlights the collective nature of production, whereby many hundred may work in a factory and yet only a very few own the factory and its equipment (capital) and thereby accrue profit. This is gained through the surplus effort of the workers over the wages paid to them, inspiring the term: ‘wage slaves’. Many people work for the (overwhelming) benefit of very few. Neoliberals might argue that with modern stock markets, in fact many get to own the capital of business. Even if many workers do have pensions (the most frequent type of personal investment) and thereby a stake-holding, this is hidden behind the profit making and exploitative financial market that operates these investments. Only the already wealthy are in a position to genuinely benefit from the big financial institutions.

Marx could not have noticed the damaging of the environment by industrialisation himself, but Marxism certainly points to an ecological limit to the expansion of capitalism. Profits have to come from somewhere and as resources become more scarce, cheaper processing, environmentally friendly or not, will be employed to add value or profit when wages can be depressed no further. In the mean time capitalism has been buoyed up against rapid collapse ever more effectively by advertising. The power of persuasion using the modern media of TV and the Internet has allowed products as unhelpful and destructive as tobacco, guns and financial credit (debt) to be sold in great quantity. People are conduced by advertising to buy what they do not need and their position as wage slaves is consolidated by their growing addiction to consumerism. This false consciousness or reification (Lukàcs and Hegel) distracts the working classes from the true nature of their both economic and superstructural subjugation and their collective potential for overturning the domination by employing their combined class-consciousness to unite. The power of advertising to persuade people to buy that which they do not need is today nearly absolute. Marx may well have viewed television and the Internet as tools of the economic base as well as cultural artefacts. 

Antonio Gramsci popularised the term ‘hegemony’ to refer to the importance of popular culture in forming a collective class consciousness and referred to a need for a counter-hegemonic force in the form of intellectuals drawn from and representative of the working class. Both Hegel and George Lukacs might have criticised this view saying that as individuals undertake non-manual labour they lose direct contact with their human essence and as they loose touch become unable to understand the nature of society. This view would certainly have upset Stalin and Zedong but not ‘El Che’ Guevara, who insisted on digging and building at the weekends even when he was in charge of the national bank. In Russia Lenin’s version of Marxism never truly followed the Communist template as his ‘New Economic policy’ allowed a limited capitalist investment to stimulate the economy and create a petty bourgeoisie. This was necessary because Russia was a largely rural country of peasants rather than an industrialised one with an alienated middle class. In fact Marx really envisioned Britain being ripe for his socialist revolution as in 1850 half of all manufactured goods globally were made there. The social suffering and damage of this massive development in rapidly overcrowding, and unplanned cities provided (so he thought) a large enough proletariat. Indeed, despite the lack of violent revolution, Britain now has a NHS and welfare state, as well as being nominally secular, democratic and largely socialist with the Labour party currently in government.

Many of the classic criticisms of Marxism arise either out of its macro-nature or the fact that it is about 150 years old. Since then new ideas have been incorporated into neo-marxist ideology most notably by Antonio Gransci and George Lukacs. Combining Marx’s view of the economy as infrastructure with new manifestations of culture, Gramsci vividly saw the hegemony of the ruling class ideology flooding into peoples lives in ever more powerful and effective media (like new technology such as mobile ‘phones and the internet). In fact the global dominance of capitalism today is so complete that the remaining (self-styled) communist regimes (all 5 of them) all receive the Internet, TV and radio signals and so are (probably fatally) exposed to the hegemony too. On the face of it postmodernism seems to blow Marxism apart simply by recognising the overwhelming complexity of society at any one moment in time. It is right that we will never be able to fully understand the reality of society and its functions, not least because such knowledge would introduce new unknown realities re-challenging our understanding. Conversely the numerically undeniable truth underwriting statistical mathematics proves some aspects of the modernist reality, in particular with regard to economics. Our absolute need to share scarce resources means that our lives are primarily concerned with acquiring the means to live.

Marxism largely ignores the subjugation of women (and other gender issues like homosexuality) and given their historical inability (equally to men) to contribute to the monetary economy it seems reasonable for a historically generated macro-view to ignore them. However, in his Communist Manifesto, Marx addresses patriarchy saying, “Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common … it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of free love springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.” He seems to envisage, with the abolition of class differences, no further innate repression of women as they represent a sub-class of the oppressed classes. Also ethnicity issues and racism are mostly ignored, although they are intrinsically involved when considering issues of class. Finally, the growth of the middle classes in the form of clerical and administrative jobs and the expanding service industry (at least in Britain and the “first world”) has complicated the reality and definitions of class strata. 

Having briefly outlined the origins of Karl Marx’s thinking about Socialism the argument has progressed from the role of economics, the existence of contradictions, the nature of the ruling class ideology to some common criticisms. It becomes clear that the Marxist perspective in sociology is still an effective method for examining societies. The macro-nature of the Marxist perspective (and functionalist) neither claims to help explain micro-issues nor assist in thinking about them. That said, it still has limitations in both examining micro-issues and in addressing the twenty-first century world’s post-modernist thinking. The neo-Marxism of Lukacs and Gramsci, in addressing hegemony and culture, help to move on with and beyond postmodernism. Society is complex and getting ever more so. As a template to understand the relations between people and the world in which they live Marxism dutifully conveys the genuine nature of suffering even today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I wrote this for a sociology essay titled &quot;Outline and evaluate a sociological perspective&quot;. I've not had it marked yet so any usefull feedback or comment would, at the least, be interesting. Oh, and I'm not neccessarily persuaded by Marxism...honestly! JBoam2005.

This is good, but I think it would be better to give a more objective study of Marx. Perhaps splitting up this article into parts? I'm suggesting important components of Marx's theory.
* Marx In Das Kapital
** Historical materialism
*** The stages of history
*** The subjugation of classes
** The critique of capitalism
*** Inequality stemming from the division of labor
*** The nature of capital itself
*** Means of production
*** The accumulation of private property and capital
** The Communist utopia
* Marx In Communist Manifesto
** Towards a communist state
*** The rise of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat from previous classes
*** Socialism
*** Revolution
** Infrastructure and institutions in the socialist state
So yeah, I was thinking of a rough outline of Marx, written in a more objective, textbook-style form instead of using a paper that makes too specific an argument for a textbook type of article. Tell me what you think! [[User:Boneheadmx|Boneheadmx]] 04:24, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called ElAmericano. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name ElAmericano~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">All that is required to write TI-BASIC is a TI calculator.  It can be purchased at a brick-and-mortar store, or online at the [http://www.ti.com Texas Instruments website]. Z80, the version of TI-BASIC covered in this book, is used on TI-83, TI-83+, TI-84+, TI-83+ Silver Edition and TI-84+ Silver Edition calculators.

== Other Utilities ==
It is also possible to use a virtual calculator, or emulator, to program and test TI-BASIC programs without a calculator. [http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html Virtual TI] was one of the first emulators for TI calculators. [http://wabbit.codeplex.com/releases/view/44625 Wabbitemu] is currently the best free Z80 emulator, for both Windows and Mac users. To use an emulator, a ROM image is needed. It is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the current state of a calculator. Wabbitemu can generate its own image, however, a ROM image can be obtained from any calculator using one of [http://www.ticalc.org/programming/emulators/romdump.html#5 these methods]. Texas Instruments has created its own excellent and all-inclusive emulator/debugger for the TI-83 and TI-83 Plus calculators, called TI-83 Plus SDK, as it is free for anyone who registers their owned TI calculator, and is found  [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/appsdelivery/download/download.jsp here], along with other Texas Instruments software.

The main advantage of using an emulator is that, while it may be convenient to write a program and test it on the fly on an actual calculator, it is faster to type-up code on a computer to test with an emulator.  An added advantage is the ability to include lower case letters on TI-83 Plus calculators, though not on regular TI-83 calculators.

A common application for programming TI BASIC on the computer is TI Edit.  It allows the user to program as they would on a calculator, with built-in menus and functions.  The drawback, however, is that TI Edit cannot run code.  It can, however, save the code as a file that can be transferred to a calculator.  The better thing to do is to use an emulator to test the programs you write before you transfer them onto a calculator.  Remember to always backup your calculator before the transfer, because there is a small chance that the program will crash the operating system.

Normally, when buying a TI calculator, a CD is included with the set that includes computer software for coding on a computer and sending files to and from computers via a TI PC Link cable (not included). The link software provided by Texas Instrument is called [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_connect.html TI-Connect], while the included program writing software is called TI-Graph Link, which can also be used as a linking program, but is out of date.

Other free 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party software can be found at [http://www.ticalc.org ticalc.org], which has a large community of TI calculator owners and programmers.  This specific [http://www.ticalc.org/pub/ page] in ticalc.org's directory contains a large list of Windows, MAC, and UNIX related software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening the Program Editor==
To begin programming in TI-BASIC, it is first necessary to bring up the program editor. Press the PRGM button, arrow over to the NEW submenu, and press enter. Then, type in a short name for your program.  Naming guidelines include:
*Numbers can be used in the name of the program, except as the first character of the name.
*The name is limited to 8 characters.
*The ALPHA mode is already set to on when creating a program name.
Also note that lowercase letters or tokens, such as &quot;sin(&quot; are disallowed in a  program name.

Press enter, and you should have a blank program:
&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:NAME
:
&lt;/pre&gt;
Always, the first line (PROGRAM:NAME) simply tells you that you are editing that program. Try pressing ENTER. When you press ENTER, a new line on the program editor is created:
&lt;pre&gt;
PROGRAM:NAME
:
:
&lt;/pre&gt;
A colon signifies a new line of the program.
*Colons are automatically placed by the calculator when creating a new line. These colons CANNOT be deleted, except by deleting the line itself.
*Manually adding a colon also signifies a new line.  These colons CAN be deleted.

To delete a line, go to the line above it and '''scroll over to the end of the line'''.  Press DEL to delete the line.
To erase code on a line, but not delete the line itself, press CLEAR.

==Starting to Program==
This is one of the many ways that you can write the traditional Hello, World! program in TI-BASIC.  This simple program tells the calculator to display the text &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot; on the screen. To get to these commands, press PRGM while in the edit screen and press &gt; once to get over to I/O. Then scroll down to find the correct command. You will encounter an error if you try to type these commands in with the alpha keys.

PROGRAM:HLLOWRLD
&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
:Disp &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;


-OR-
PROGRAM:HLOWRLD2
&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
:Output(1,1,&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;


-OR-
PROGRAM:HLOWRLD3
&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
:&quot;Hello, World!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Typing the Code and Explanation of It===
Line by line, here's how to enter and what each command does.

&lt;pre&gt;
:ClrHome
&lt;/pre&gt;

Every new line in a BASIC program automatically starts with a colon (:).  It's how the calculator figures out when a line ends and a new line begins.  [[../List of Commands/ClrHome|ClrHome]] ('''PRGM:I/O:8''') is the instruction that clears the home screen, erasing any text or numbers that may have been on it.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Disp &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[../List of Commands/Disp|Disp]] ('''PRGM:I/O:3''') displays the string (whatever is in quotes.)  If the screen is full, it will scroll down a line.  If the string is more than 16 characters, Disp will only show the first 15 of them, followed by an ellipse (...).  During execution of the program, the user will not be able to scroll and see the rest of the line if the 16 character limit is exceeded.  Strings are displayed left-justified.

&lt;pre&gt;
:Output(1,1,&quot;HELLO, WORLD&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Output ('''PRGM:I/O:6''') tells the calculator to display a string at the top-left corner of the screen. This usage exploits the fact that the calculator will not display &quot;Done&quot; if &quot;Output&quot; is the last command in a program. Displaying an empty string thus supresses &quot;Done&quot; without changing the screen.

&lt;pre&gt;
:&quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another way to remove the Done is to place a string or a number at the last line of the program. If the program ends after that line, it will show that string or number instead of Done.


To run this program, exit out of edit mode by pressing '''2nd:MODE(Quit)'''.
'''Warning!''' On some old versions of the Operating System on the TI-83+, the calculator may crash if there are many other programs. You should update the operating system, or (preferably) program on the computer and then transfer to the calculator.
Then press '''PRGM''' and move down to find the program under the name you entered.  Press '''Enter''' to paste it into the homescreen, and press '''Enter''' again to run the program.  You should see the following text on the screen when you run it.

&lt;pre&gt;
HELLO, WORLD!
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the final line is omitted, it will display:
&lt;pre&gt;
HELLO, WORLD!
            Done
&lt;/pre&gt;

To go back to the program editor, press '''PRGM''', arrow over to the EDIT submenu, and press '''Enter''' when the program's name appears.

{{see also|TI-Basic 84 Programming}}
This book covers the Z80 processor's version of TI-BASIC.

==Overview==
TI-BASIC is a simple programming language used on Texas Instruments (TI) graphing calculators. The language is quite simple, and integrates many normal graphing calculator commands (such as storing variables or graphing) into its code.

TI-BASIC is very easy to program, especially when compared to Assembly, which is the other main language that can be used to program TI graphing calculators. Also, programs written in TI-BASIC can have small filesizes, since common functions can be programmed with just one character (1-2 bytes), such as &lt;code&gt;If &lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Menu(&lt;/code&gt;. However, this makes execution of TI-BASIC programs very slow. because each line of code must be read and parsed before execution. Despite the crawling speed of TI-BASIC, it's appropriate for many simple programs.

==Versions of TI-BASIC==
There are two main versions of TI-BASIC in use today:

*The TI-BASIC that comes with the TI-89, TI 89 Titanium, TI-92, TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 calculators. This is the more powerful version of TI-BASIC.

*The TI-BASIC that comes with the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-83+ Silver Edition, TI-84+ and TI-84+ Silver Edition calculators. This is a less powerful version of TI-BASIC, but is still fairly versatile.

Please note that within these two versions of TI-BASIC there are slight variations.

== Table of Contents ==
This table of contents arranges the sections in the best order possible for those who are trying to learn the language.  However, if you are already familiar with TI-BASIC, you may decide to skip certain sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello. Thanks for your contributions, but I do not think it's a good idea to move the pages by copying &amp;amp; pasting. We should use &quot;move&quot; action instead so that the page histories continue (thus, meet the GFDL requirement). To use &quot;move&quot; action, you have to create an account and log in.

I'm sorry but I'm goint to put the pages you created to VfD(Vote for Deletion), and after they're deleted, I'll move the correspoinding pages. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 06:41, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Unconstructive edits ==

I've removed a number of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Writing_Effective_Songs&amp;diff=1406924&amp;oldid=1383889 edits] which I consider harmful. I replaced them with a {{tl|disputed}} note to mark the expressed concerns. Feel free to discuss the matter here, or consider making more constructive edits to improve this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:59, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== &quot;Swing&quot; ==

In &quot;The Mechanical Elements of a Song&quot; there is a line which says :&quot;The traditional, where every note is played as shown, and the &quot;swing&quot;, used in Blues and Jazz, where, for example, two half-beats go &quot;bomp-bomb&quot; (kind of like heartbeat&quot;. I thought that kind of swing you mentioned is called shuffle.
&lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:91.61.10.149|91.61.10.149]] ([[User talk:91.61.10.149|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/91.61.10.149|contribs]]) 17:19, 20 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

== Better known example regarding originality==
Warner Bothers Looney Tunes Cartoon uses a copyright song called &quot;Merry go round broke down&quot; but this bears an uncanny resemblance to the almost universal nursery rhyme  &quot;Mary had a lamb&quot;. The difference is subtle but seems sufficient to protect the rights. possibly, I am not a musician. --[[User:Tradimus|Tradimus]] ([[User talk:Tradimus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tradimus|contribs]]) 03:54, 11 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

Kontrollieren eines Balles in GameBlender

Ok, in diesem Tutorial erkläre ich euch wie man einen Ball im GameBlender kontrolliert


Als erstes öffnen Sie Blender. Wenn Sie Blender öffnen erscheint ein Quadrat! Löschen Sie es mit Entf! So, Als nächstes drücken Sie die Leertaste, es erscheint ein Menü! Es steht auf dem Menü “Add“! Klicken Sie auf es! Dann erscheint eine Liste! Mit vielen Formen! Eines davon heißt “Plane“, klicken Sie auf des! Wenn Sie es angeklickt haben kommt automatisch ein Plane! So, als nächstes wollen wir den Plane Vierecke verpassen! Um das zu machen drücken Sie auf &quot;W&quot;, es erscheint eine Liste mit vielen Funktionen, eine davon heißt &quot;Subdivide&quot;! Drücken Sie 3 mal auf Subdivide! Der Plane bekommt schon langsam Vierecke! Herzlichen Glückwunsch! Als nächstes drücken Sie bitte 2 mal auf &quot;B&quot;! Es erscheint dann ein Kreis! Diesen Kreis übrigens können Sie, K/G (kleiner oder größer) machen indem Sie mit der mittleren Taste ihrer Maus hinter &amp; vorwert gehen! So, mit diesem Kreis können Sie ein paar von dem Vierecken auf dem Plane selektieren! Wie gesagt nur ein paar! Dann klicken Sie mit der RMT ( Rechten Maus Taste ), damit der Kreis verschwindet! Dann gehen Sie zu &quot;Seidview&quot;, Nummer3 auf der Tastatur ( Rechts neben den Buchstaben)! Dann drücken &quot;E&quot;. (Extrude)! Es steht dann da Region klicken Sie es! Dann ziehen Sie die Maus ein kleines Stück nach unten! So, jetzt gehen Sie in dem Kameraview NR 0! Jetzt sehen Sie das Resultat! Jetzt machen wir den Spieler einen Ball1 Um denn zu machen drücken Sie die Leertaste, dann ADD&gt;MESH&gt;UVSphere wenn Sie jetzt auf UVSphere sind, klicken Sie es! Dann kommt die Zahl 32, diese Zahl können Sie löschen, indem Sie einfach auf die Zahl klicken! Die Zahl die wir haben wollen ist, 16! So, wenn Sie die Zahl getippt haben, kommt automatisch ein Ball! Jetzt, um den Ball zu kontrollieren mit dem Pfeiltasten, müssen Sie als erstes auf &quot;i&quot; drücken, dann kommt eine Liste, mit vielen Funktionen, eine davon heißt &quot;LocRot&quot;! Klicken Sie es! Dann wechseln Sie auf Frame25 um, &amp; bewegen denn Ball ein kleines Stück nach vorne &amp; wieder LocRot!

So, Sie haben denn Tutorial überstanden</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ilan. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ilan~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Why do you suppose this image is fair use? Generally, fair use means using an image for educational purpose (showing something). I think this does not apply here. Furthermore, you did not specify the source of the image. Apart from this, image is not used. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">When atoms are unstable, they will try to make themselves stable again. One way that they do this is by giving off matter and energy known as '''radiation'''. A material with unstable atoms is said to be '''radioactive'''.

==Types of radiation==
There are 3 different types of '''ionising radiation''', simply called '''α (alpha)''', '''β (beta)''' and '''γ (gamma)''', each with their own properties.

'''α-particles'''

An alpha particle is basically a helium nucleus. The table below shows its properties:

&lt;center&gt;
{|- cellpadding=&quot;5px&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;1px&quot;
|'''Nature:'''
|2 protons &amp; 2 neutrons (a helium nucleus)
|-
|'''Symbol:'''
| α, &lt;math&gt;\ ^4_2He&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|'''Mass:'''
| 4 times the mass of a proton (~4u)

==Ionisation==

α, β and γ radiation are all forms of ionising radiation and they affect the matter that they pass through. They can cause atoms to become '''ionised''' by colliding into, or passing closely to them. The atoms have their electrons pushed or pulled by the radiation and become ions, hence the name '''ionisation'''.

'''α particles'''

α particles are the most strongly ionising because they have the greatest mass and charge, and have the lowest velocity. This means that they affect the most amount of atoms and affect each atom stronger than the other types of radiation.

'''β particles'''

β particles are the second most strongly ionising because they are lighter, faster and have a smaller charge then α particles.

'''γ rays'''

γ rays are the least ionising of the 3, since they have no charge.

==Penetration==
[[Image:Alfa beta gamma radiation.svg|right|200px]]
Radiation can pass through different materials, though each type of radiation has its own penetration power.

'''α radiation'''

α radiation can be easily absorbed by a sheet of paper or by human skin. This is because it is highly ionising and easily gives its kinetic energy to surrounding atoms and therefore cannot penetrate far into matter.

'''β radiation'''

β radiation is less ionising, which makes it more penetrating than α radiation. It needs a denser material such as aluminium to completely absorb it.

'''γ radiation'''

γ radiation is the most pentrating and several metres of concrete or a few centimeters of lead are required to completely absorb it. Again, this is related to its strength of ionisation.

==Nuclear equations==

Just like other nuclear processes, radiation emissions can be represented by balanced nuclear equations. An alpha particle has a symbol of &lt;math&gt;\ ^4_2&lt;/math&gt;He and a beta particle has a symbol of &lt;math&gt;\ ^0_{-1}&lt;/math&gt;e. These can easily be used in equations where radiation is emitted. Gamma photons do not have any effect on the equations since they have no mass and no charge.

==Electric and magnetic fields==

Because of their different charges and masses, each type of radiation behaves differently in electric and magnetic fields. The behaviour of positive and negative particles moving in electric and magnetic fields have already been discussed earlier. Be especially careful using the left hand rule for β particles in a magnetic field because, as you may recall, the current is in the opposite direction to the movement of an electron. Gamma rays are not affected by either types of field and will continue in a straight line.

==The hazards of ionising radiation==
Radiation is dangerous and steps must be taken to ensure that we are exposed to as little radiation as possible. We will have a look at these dangers and see how we can minimize the damage to ourselves and the environment.

===Effects on living organisms===

Since radiation is ionising, it can alter the atoms that make up our own cells. There are two main ways that our cells can become damaged by radiation:

*Exposure to intense radiation can kill cells, causing tissue damage known as radiation burn. This same principle is used to kill microbes from food or on medical equipment.
*DNA can be altered by an ionisation, causing the cell to no longer function correctly. The radiation may affect the DNA directly, or break up a water molecule which will then react with the DNA. The cell may divide uncontrollably, forming a tumour. Also, if the radiation affects an egg or sperm cell, there will be mutations passed on to the next generation.

Alpha particles are the most dangerous to cells, but fortunately our skin is sufficient to prevent them from entering our bodies  .

===Handling radioactive materials safely===

Since radiation is very hazardous, radioactive materials must be handled, stored and disposed of in a safe manner.

To handle radioactive materials, they must not come into contact with the skin, and must be handled in a glove box or with tongs. Care must be taken to not inhale radioactive gas.

To store radioactive materials you can use lead-lined containers, since lead absorbs all of the different types of radiation. This is also true for materials that emit α radiation, since most α emitting materials will also emit γ radiation.

Radioactive materials can be disposed of by diluting the radioactive substance with a large amount of non-radioactive material. They can also be disposed of by containment, which involves storing the radioactive material until it has dropped to a safe level of radioactivity.

==Radioactive decay==

As radioactive materials emit radiation, the number of stable nuclei increase, and the number of unstable nuclei decrease. The substance is said to '''decay''' because it decreases in mass as particles and energy is given off.

===Spontaneous radiation emission===

If we were to observe a single nucleus of an unstable atom, we would eventually see it decay. We won't be able to predict how long it would take for it to decay, and there is no way to tell if it is about to decay or not. It will be undecayed at one moment, and an instant later, it would have decayed. It is a spontaneuous action. This is very strange to the way things are on the macroscopic level that we are used to, where we can see gradual changes or the build up to an event.

Also, each atoms nucleus decays independently of any neighbouring atoms, because if you recall the relative distances and sizes of subatomic particles, there is an enormous amount of empty space between the nucleus and its orbiting electrons, which means that one nucleus cannot affect another.

Since we cannot predict when a nucleus will decay, we have to find an average over a period of time.

===The decay constant===

The '''decay constant''' is the probability that a particular nucleus will decay per unit time, and is denoted by the symbol λ. It can be found for a particular sample by measuring how many nuclei decay for a given length of time. So, if in a sample with 10,000 nuclei, 1000 were to decay in an hour, the probability of one particular nucleus decaying within an hour is 0.1, because only 10% of the nuclei decayed.

The decay constant has the units &lt;math&gt;s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; in the SI system, but &lt;math&gt;h^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, or even &lt;math&gt;day^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; may be used. In the example above, the decay constant, λ, is equal to 0.1&lt;math&gt;h^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Activity and count rate===

The '''activity''' of a radioactive substance is the number of nuclei that decay in a unit of time, or the rate of decay. Activity is measured in decays per second, and one decay per second is called one '''becquerel'''.

If you know the decay constant of a particular substance, and the number of undecayed nuclei it has, you can find the activity for that material using the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\lambda N&lt;/math&gt;

where A is the activity, λ is the decay constant, and N is the number of undecayed nuclei.

As you can see, this would take us back to how we originally found the decay constant, and so you can how the two are related.

When you are obtaining the activity of a sample with an experiment, you will hardly ever detect all of the radiation emitted. Some will be emitted where there are no detectors. The '''count rate''', R, is the measurement from the experiment, which will be less than the activity of the sample. A can be calculated from R if you know the efficiency of the measuring device.

==Exponential decay==

As a radioactive substance decays, the number of undecayed nuclei will decrease. Since there are less radioactive particles in the substance, the rate of radioactive particles emitted will decrease. A graph of the amount of substance against time will show an exponential curve, where the curve continually gets less steep as the rate of decay decreases.

===Calculating decay===

The number of undecayed nuclei can be calculated with the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;N = N_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; is the number of undecayed at the start, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time in seconds, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, is the exponential function.

Similarly, the count rate and activity can be found from the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;R = R_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A = A_0e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;

===Half-life===

The '''half life''' of a substance is the mean length of time it takes for half of its radioactive material to decay. If you look at the graph, you can see that the time on the horizontal axis for the number of undecayed nuclei to half is the same as the time for it to decrease from 50% to 25%, and from 25% to 12.5%.

Half life is written as &lt;math&gt;t_{ \frac {1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, and is usually measured in seconds, but for materials that are more stable, it is common to state the half life in hours, days, or even years.

If you consider that a substance with a short half life must decay quickly, and therefore must have a high decay constant, and that a substance with a long half life will have a low decay constant, you can relate the two using the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda t_{ \frac {1}{2}} = \ln 2 \approx 0.693&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful if you are only given either the half life or the decay constant and asked to find the other, as you can rearrange the equation to find the unknown value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rise and fall of Nationalism is so impressive that I continue to research what difference Nationalism could have made if applied without religion and race as a demorilizing basis for Nationalism.  To me without Nationalistic values, countries will implode over time and just like Rome and currently the moral decay within the US, there is a lack of guidence and resolve within the country to stay loyal to your country.  

Nationalism can work and should be a main focus of country education and direction.

:Nationalism causes violence and economic differences. Making a distinction between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; always leads to segregation, persecution and sometimes genocide. I don't see why powerful countries should survive in modern days either; if the economic differences in the world can be resolved, powerful states will only cause problems. In fact, some aspects of current powerful states (specially the US federal state) are a great obstacle for the general development of humanity.

:About this page of the book, I wanted to suggest a change of the names &quot;March Revolution&quot; and &quot;November Revolution&quot; to the more common February and October Revolutions respectively.--[[User:200.82.110.124|200.82.110.124]] 23:59, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

In this passage: &quot;Vladimir Lenin realized that the time had come to seize the revolution. He authored the &quot;April Theses,&quot; in which he promised peace with the Central Powers, redistribution of the land, transfer of the factories to the owners, and the recognition of the Soviets as the supreme power in Russia. In this sense, the November Revolution was led by Lenin rather than being an overall coup by the workers, and thus the November revolution cannot be dubbed a true Marxist revolution.&quot;  Shouldn't it read &quot;transfer of the factories to the workers?&quot;

== Russia ==

Pre-war material on Russia moved to the previous chapter, on Empire, where it is a better fit. [[Special:Contributions/62.25.106.209|62.25.106.209]] ([[User talk:62.25.106.209|talk]]) 12:20, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Cybertaur1. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Cybertaur1~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Rights of Instream Flow Users in Georgia'''

==Description of the issue==

When streams are used for water supply, water must taken (withdrawn) from the stream, thereby leaving less water in the stream to provide for the instream flow uses.  The instream flow uses include the following (each will be linked to page describing that instream use in Georgia):  

*[[/Aquatic habitat maintenance/]]
*[[/Fishing/]]
:*[[/Subsistence fishing/]]
:*[[/Commercial fishing/]]
:*[[/Sport fishing/]]
*[[/Recreation/]]
:*[[/Boating/]]
:*[[/Swimming/]]
:*[[/Outdoor|Outdoor (trails, picnic, camping)]]
*[[/Spiritual/]] 
*[[/Aesthetic|Aesthetic (e.g. lake view lots)]]
*[[/Hydropower|Hydropower (run-of-the-river type)]]
*[[/Navigation/]]
*[[/Wastewater dilution/]]

When water is withdrawn from a river, but only partially returned (usually as treated wastewater), the downstream flow is reduced by an amount called the &quot;consumptive use&quot; (withdrawal amount minus the returned amount).  The reduction in streamflow will affect all of the instream flow users below the withdrawal point, with impacts to individual users ranging from insignificant to major, according to the type of stream user and the amount and timing of the streamflow reduction.  

'''Definition:'''  The instream flow users are those who use the stream without withdrawing water from the stream.

'''Policy Issue:'''  
The policy issue for the State is:  What are the rights of the instream flow users?  What policy should the State have for allowing an increased consumptive water withdrawal from a stream, with the corresponding reduction in the instream flow which impacts all the existing (and future) instream flow users?

==Georgia's present policy on instream flow==

Georgia's present policy on instream flow, called the &quot;interim minimum stream flow protection policy&quot;, was adopted by the Georgia Board of Natural Resources effective April 1, 2001.[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/publications/whitepaper.pdf] 

Basically, the policy reserves a minimum streamflow for use by all instream flow users.  The Georgia EPD implements the policy by requiring applicants for new (filed after March 30, 2001) non-farm water withdrawal permits to at all times &quot;pass the lesser of the monthly 7Q10 or the inflow at the withdrawal point&quot; (and in some cases, plus a non-depletable flow -- an amount sufficient to serve the pre-existing permitted downstream withdrawal uses).  The monthly 7Q10 streamflow is a drought streamflow statistic &quot;that reflects the lowest seven-day running average of a stream's flow for each calendar month with a recurrence frequency of once in ten years.&quot; [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/services/policy/environmental/georgiacommittee/publications/whitepaper.pdf | p.28] 

The policy for limiting streamflow withdrawals, in order to protect the reserved instream flow, applies only to surface water allocation water requests made ''after March 30, 2001'' by ''non-farm'' applicants on rivers which are not highly influenced by a federal reservoir.  The policy does not limit the withdrawals of the following:
(a) small withdrawers (each less than 100,000 gallons per day), (b) &quot;reasonable use&quot; for agricultural water users, (c) any agricultural water use for capacity in place by 1988, whether reasonable or not, and (d) any water withdrawals used to pay off revenue certificates or general obligation bonds from 1977 or prior.   It is possible for these types of unrestricted water withdrawals to completely drain the streamflow during a drought.

'''THIS ARTICLE IS QUITE OUTDATED. PLEASE HELP MODERNIZE IT'''


===Classic Mac OS===

Mac OS was introduced in 1984, after the Apple Lisa project. The earlier OSs were very simple and used a monochrome color scheme. 

Macintoshes have built in speakers. When one is turned on, a chime sounds, indicating successful hardware detection. The loading of these early OSs involve several grey screens, depending on the type of hardware installed. The first thing to appear is a movable mouse arrow. Common error messages include a Question Mark on top of either a folder or a diskette. Occasionally startup errors occur, some of which can be resolved by themselves. An example is a question mark appears on a folder for several seconds, alternating with the Finder logo and finishing with the Finder Logo. Another grey screen appears with a successful startup message. The successful startup message is called &quot;Happy Mac&quot;, which is a picture of an 1984-era Macintosh with a smiley face on its display screen. A system failure can present &quot;Sad Mac&quot;. These images later evolved into iPods, such as the &quot;Sad iPod&quot; image. Sad Mac can also be accompanied with sound effects, such as glass shattering or a car crashing.

The fact that the Mac OS has the mouse arrow loading first, instead of last, means that the Mac OS is more GUI-oriented and does not include a command line interface.

The Operating System loads, usually with a seamless transition to the desktop by gradually loading parts of the desktop. It begins with a Splash Screen, main extensions loading, and then the Menu Bar loads. The installed extensions load, often taking over one minute to load depending on the number of extensions, and then the desktop icons and any application switchers load. 

The first Mac OSs, or Systems, were very basic and had very little release numbers.  1.0 jumped directly to 2.0 for example. Also there isn't any multitasking available on very early Mac OSs.

System 7 was the first OS with noticeable improvements. OS 8 included more improvements. 

Software that can be installed on these OSs include many games and After Dark screen saver packages.

The last version of OS 9, and the last version to use the original Mac OS source code, is 9.2.2. You can see that it contains an early version of the Aqua and Brushed Metal color schemes. Additionally, iTunes, QuickTime, Sherlock 2, and a few other applications use a brushed metal appearance similar to OS X.

Also with Mac OS, a monochrome Pinwheel mouse cursor is used to indicate that the system was busy. It would occasionally be shared with the mouse arrow cursor. Other busy cursors is a monochrome watch that usually does not have its needles, or &quot;hands&quot;, move. Occasionally the minute hand moves. Another icon (not a cursor) is a circle with two monochrome arrows rotating clockwise. This resembles the rotating Lou Scheimer-Norm Prescott production logo. In OS X, Two of these busy signals would be updated. The monochrome pinwheel was replaced with a color one, and used more often instead of the watch. The pinwheel would not be shared with the mouse arrow cursor. The two arrows was replaced with several lines arranged in a circle. The watch was not updated and only appears occasionally.

9.2.2 and earlier are not supported by Apple, Inc. Software Update will not function. Additionally, there isn't any Yahoo Messenger that will function on 9.2.2 and earlier. Podcasting is impossible with 9.2.2. Many applications are only released as Disk Images or .dmg files which are not read by 9.2.2 and earlier. 9.2.2 and earlier can not mount any case sensitive volumes. Mac OS 9.2.2 CAN load most graphic images such as JPEG, and can also open up .sit, .iso, .smi, and .bin files.

Mac OS X server was released before 9.2.2, and the rest of the operating systems transitioned to the NeXTstep OS-like OS X.
&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Aftermarket Software for Classic Mac OS==
The Mac OS before OS X is still compatible with most new technologies with the use of aftermarket software. A dock can be added with an extension called &quot;A-Dock&quot;. Documents can be saved in Rich Text Format with iText. Internet browsing can be accomplished with &quot;Clasilla&quot;, an updated Mozilla browser. 

Performance with this software:

The Classic Mac OS versions use a spring-loaded Finder. The Dock resembles OS X's dock with the exception of A-Dock being spring loaded.

iText can save files with RTF formats, making the documents compatible with OS X's TextEdit.

Navigating is stable with the exception of scrolling (toggling the scroll bars can cause the entire operating system to crash, and instead users have to use the Page Up and Page Down keys) There is a &quot;Use Style: None&quot; option to disable style sheets. Page loads are slower compared with OS X browsers.

Mac OS 9.2.2 is the last Mac OS to use the original source code (OS X is similar to the NeXTstep operating system) &quot;After Dark&quot; screen savers are not officially supported on 9.2.2 but an application has been released to use most of the After Dark screen savers. 

9.2.2 also has some compatibility with hardware that was made after its release. This includes USB storage devices, and wide screen LCD monitors.

=== Mac OS X ===
[http://www.apple.com/macosx/ Mac OS X] (&quot;ten&quot;) is the current version of the proprietary OS made by Apple Computer.  It is largely based on the NeXT operating system and the Macintosh System Software.  Apple also produces Mac OS X Server, which is geared towards high-end computing needs, such as clustering and remote management of individual CPUs.  Apple promotes Mac OS X as being more user-friendly than its competitors' operating systems with a powerful UNIX foundation.  Mac OS X has been 64-bit compatible since version 10.3, allowing it to run on the G5 processor.

Backwards compatibility with Mac OS 9 and earlier was maintained by using the &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Carbon&quot; environments. Carbon is a cleaned-up version of the old Mac API, designed to run well on MacOS X. Classic is the new term for the old Mac API, cruftyness and all. Classic apps suffer from some limitations, in much the same way that old Windows 3.1 apps suffer in the WoW environment of Windows.

Older Macintosh technologies, such as QuickTime and Keychain, were incorporated into the design of OS X with other predominantly NeXT technologies, such as the Dock and its kernel.  Although the Macintosh System Software is proprietary in origin, NeXT's operating system was developed from [[Open Source]] [[wikipedia:BSD|BSD]].  Much of the [[wikipedia:Apple Darwin|Darwin]] kernel can be traced back to NeXT.  Darwin remains publicly available: As a PowerPC binary, an Intel-x86 binary, and as source code (Binary versions are available for major revisions, such as 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, etc.).  Many of the graphics routines stem from the Macintosh QuickDraw graphics routines, which were updated and renamed &quot;Quartz&quot; in Mac OS X 10.2 (a.k.a. &quot;Jaguar&quot;).

&lt;!-- Note to editors:  The following line read ''Because of the tiny user base, OS X is currently considered a unlikely target for viruses, and users are often happy to use the built-in firewall without any further virus checking programs.'' This can be debated ''ad infinitum''.--&gt;
Recent versions of computers running Mac OS X include &quot;iApps&quot;, such as iTunes (jukebox software), and iLife applications, including iPhoto (a picture organizing application), iMovie (a non-linear video editor), etc. Remember: most of these applications do not come as part of the operating system, but rather are pre-installed.

At its launch, Mac OS X was criticized by many users as being more NeXT-like than Mac-like.  It was also criticized due to its heavy memory requirement (128 megabytes), narrow scope of supported processors (PowerPC 604, G3, and G4), size on hard disk (approximately 2 gigabytes), and its relatively drastic user interface change from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, leaving many users feeling unfamiliar with the operating system.  There were also minor complaints, such as the disappearance of the &quot;Happy Mac&quot; (an icon displayed on the screen at startup to indicate a successful self-test result).  Also hampering support for Mac OS X was a lack of &quot;Carbonized&quot; software, such as Microsoft's Office software suite, and Adobe's Photoshop image editing program.

The Microsoft Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface) and the Aqua window manager of Mac OS X differ cosmetically, but both use the same desktop paradigm.  The main differences are in widget, icon, and menu bar placement.  The menu bar placement is reportedly in conformance with Fitt's Law for interface design.  Among Apple's distinguishing interface design features is its one-button mouse and command key.  While Microsoft Windows expects the use of a two-button mouse (and on some Linux and Unix OSs, three),  Apple has used a one-button mouse since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984&lt;!-- Jan. 24, 1984 --&gt;, and uses the control key on the keyboard as a click-modifier (called &quot;control-click&quot;), analogous to the Microsoft Windows &quot;right-click&quot;. However, Apple does make a multi-button mouse called the [http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/ Mighty Mouse] which is available separately, and third party multi-button USB mice can also be used. Finally, the command key is dedicated to the purpose of selecting menu items by its keyboard-based equivalent.

* Interesting side note: The command key symbol, represented by Unicode glyph U+2318, means &quot;place of interest&quot;.  It was intended to be the only marking on the command key.  However, it was decided that the Apple logo should also be on the key, in order to maintain backwards compatibility with the Apple II line of 8-bit computers.

* Side note: Recently, Apple decided to make its multibutton mouse, the above mentioned Mighty Mouse, the standard mouse for its iMacs.

From January 10, 2006 to August 7, 2006, Apple transitioned from PowerPC to Intel processors. PowerPC chips had been in use from OS 7 to 10. Jobs stated the transition was enacted because of IBM's failure to develop the PowerPC chip as rapidly as Apple has hoped. Furthermore, Intel chips offered higher performance per watt, and had cooler operation - essential for laptop production. Some software will only work on PowerPC or Intel architecture, even though it runs under the same system. However, most updated software is now available in a Universal version - with binaries for both PowerPC and Intel Macs. Universal software will work on both PowerPC and Intel Macs that meet basic system requirements.

* Side note: Support for older (pre Mac OS X) software under the &quot;Classic&quot; environment is not provided on Intel-based Macintosh computers. &quot;Classic&quot; was supported by the Motorola 68LC040 emulator built into the PowerPC chip. 

From OS 10.6 and above, the Mac OS X disables any possibility of it being on a system with a PPC processor and can only run on Intel processors.

== What Are Vertex Groups? ==
Vertex groups are very useful.  You can use a vertex group to:
*Group vertices together while you model (keep a selection and come back to it later).
*Define which vertices softbody simulation affects.
*Define which vertices emit particles.
*Define which part of a mesh will follow a specific bone.

Vertex groups are specific to the Mesh object and can be modified in Editmode.

If you have vertices assigned to multiple groups (for example, in a character you may have some vertices in the &quot;upper arm&quot; vertex group that are also in the &quot;lower arm&quot; vertex group), you can assign weights to those vertices to specify how much relative influence the different groups have.  A weight can range from 0 to 1 and is assigned when you create the group. Let's take a peek at the GUI of vertex groups in the Editbutton(F9KEY):

[[File:Vgroups_but.jpg]]

From top down:
*The dropdown menu lets you select an existing vertex group or rename the current one.
*The weight numfield lets you choose the weight value assigned when you add vertices.
*You can add a new group or delete the current one.
*Assign or remove selected vertices to/from current group.
*Select/deselect all vertices in current group.

== Weight Paint ==
As mentioned above, you may often find that you have some vertices that are assigned to more than one vertex group.  By assigning weights, you can specify the relative influence each of the vertex groups have.  You have two options to assign weights: 1) manually selecting each vertex and typing in a weight value, or 2) use weight painting to - you guessed it - paint weights.

Weight painting lets you paint weight values on the mesh like you were painting on a wall with a can of spray paint. It is a Mode of the 3Dview and is accessible in the 3Dview's header in the dropdown menu with Objectmode, Editmode and such. A hotkey is also available: CTRL-TABKEY.

In Weightpaint Mode, the first thing you'll notice is the blue color of the mesh. Blender provides an easy way to quickly visualise the weight value of each vertex. This is the color spectrum used:

[[File:Blender3D Weight Spec.jpg]]

When you are in Weightpaint mode you can paint all over the mesh as if it was a solid object on your desk. The paint only works on vertices so don't try to paint in the middle of an edge or a face, it will never work. To help you in your task there is a new panel in Editbutton:

[[File:Paint_panel.jpg]]

*The weight slider is just the same thing as the weight numfield we saw earlier in the vertex groups button. It's just easier to work with. It's simply the weight you want to apply to the vertices.  In painting terms, think of this as the color.
*The buttons from 0 to 1 are shortcuts for weight value, to speed up the workflow.
*The opacity slider (and shortcuts) tell Blender what is the percent of the weight value you want to apply in one shot. If you set opacity and weight to 1 the vertex will turn red instantly.  In painting terms, think of this as the pressure.
*&quot;All faces&quot; tells Blender if you want to paint on all faces in the mesh or just the visible one.
*&quot;Vertex Dist&quot; tells blender to use vertex distance instead of faces. When active, the painting will only check if the vertex is in the brush, then apply a weight value. If it's off, all vertices part of the faces in the brush will receive weight value. Turning on Vertex Dist can give good results when you have a lot of polys in your mesh.
*&quot;Normals&quot; will apply vertex normals before painting. This means Blender will take consideration of the direction the vertex is pointing when painting: the more it's facing away from view, the less it will receive value.
*&quot;Spray&quot; really makes it like spraying paint. Without it, a single click will only paint one value. With Spray on, each time you move the mouse a paint shot will be added. To get a good effect, use a small opacity value so the weight will increase slowly.
*&quot;X-mirror&quot; will tell Blender to apply the weight paint on the other group if there is one. Like Hand.L --&gt; Hand.R. If you paint the group hand.L and there is a hand.R the paint will be copied over. For this to work your groups must be created, the name of the groups have to follow name's convention (left right) and both side of the mesh need to be identical.
*&quot;Wire toggle&quot; toggles the visibility of wire while painting. Useful to find where the vertices are (activate the edit mode option &quot;Draw all edges&quot; to see even better).
*&quot;Mix&quot;/&quot;Add&quot;/&quot;Sub&quot;/&quot;Mul&quot;/&quot;Filter&quot; is how you want to apply the paint based on what is already there. Mixing will do a mean from brute weight value and current weight value, &quot;Add&quot;/&quot;Sub&quot; will directly add or subtract value, &quot;Mul&quot; will multiply (exponential painting) and &quot;Filter&quot; will paint based on alpha value.

== Vertex Groups and Armatures ==
So what use are vertex groups in rigging? You can specify what vertices will move when a bone moves. When you want to paint a mesh for an armature, do the following:
*Make sure the Mesh has an Armature modifier.
*Select the armature and enable Armature Posemode (CTRL-TABKEY).
*Select the mesh and enter Weightpaint mode (CTRL-TABKEY).  ('''Question: if we're in Pose Mode for the Armature, how are we supposed to select the mesh?  Ans: right click on it.''')
*Select the bone you want to paint for with RMB.
*Paint the parts you want that bone to affect.

You'll notice that, if there is no group created when you first paint, Blender will create a group for you, and give it the same name as the selected bone. This is important, because when the &quot;Vert. Groups&quot; toggle is on in the Armature modifier, Blender will try to match bones with Vertex Groups based on the same names.

What happens when we try to blend groups together? See this simple example of 2 bones trying to bend a tube:

[[File:Ie_paint_tube.jpg]]

The Groups are painted so the body of each bone is in red and the zone between the two bones are gradually going from 1 to 0. This will bend nicely. If, for a special reason, you want a side to react differently, you can always move the bone while painting and try the new modification you just did. By the way, having Subsurf on while painting can be very cpu expensive. It's a good idea to turn it off.

== Using Weight Painting with Armatures ==
Armatures are used for many purposes, but one common use is to deform a mesh with an armature.  This example will demonstrate how weight painting can improve armature-deformed meshes.  

In this example, we have two objects; each has an armature modifier applied.  The one on the left is going to be the &quot;before&quot; and the one on the right will be the &quot;after&quot;.

[[File:two_objects.jpg|thumb|The two objects in this example.|300 px|center]]

For the object on the left, take a look at the vertex groups as initially assigned
(from left to right: Bone1, Bone2, Bone3, and Bone4).  These same vertex groups were assigned for the object on the right:

[[File:Vertex_groups.jpg|thumb|Vertex group assignments for each of the two objects.|400px|center]]

'''Important:''' A bone in an armature will only act upon those vertices that are in a vertex group with exactly the same name as the bone.  

*In Blender 2.37 and previous, this was the ONLY way to get a bone to deform a mesh.  
*In Blender 2.40 and on, selecting the &quot;Envelope&quot; button in the armature modifier will allow bones to deform even if you haven't assigned any vertex groups yet.

If you enter Weight Paint mode (CTRL-TAB with object selected) right after assigning the vertex groups, you can see that the vertex groups as assigned all have a weight of 1.0:

[[File:initial_weights.jpg|thumb|Initial weights for the vertex groups assigned above.|400px|center]]

OK: both objects have vertex groups assigned and they have armature modifiers.  Let's grab a bone (select the Armature, CTRL-TAB to enter Pose Mode, select Bone4, GKEY to grab, and move) to deform the mesh.  We haven't made the objects different from each other, so after moving their armatures in the same way . . there's still no difference.  That's good.

{{wikipedia|CP/M}}
An old operating system created during the late 1970s. CP/M or Control Program for Microcomputers ran on 8 bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 or Zilog Z80.  Typically these had 4 to 64 kilobytes of RAM and speeds of up to 10 MHz. It was rare for a disk from one CP/M computer to be properly read by a computer from a different company, but was still considered a kind of loose &quot;standard&quot;. It faded from popular use by 1985, overtaken by MS-DOS and the Mac OS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Cha Cha Cha is a popular social dance characterized by the &quot;cha-cha-cha&quot; rhythm during the 'chassé' (side-close-side step). Although originally called the Cha Cha Cha it is now commonly referred to simply as the Cha Cha.

==History==
The name of this dance is said to arise from the sound of sandals slapping against the floor in the cha cha chassé.

The Cha Cha is a true Latin dance, which originated in Cuba where it evolved from the [[danzon]], an older form of Cuban dance. The primary difference in Cha Cha is the addition of a triple step that replaces the slow step in Mambo/Rumba. Cha Cha became a popular social ballroom dance in the United States in the early 1950's.  

Presently there are two flavors of Cha Cha, differing by the place of the '''cha cha cha''' with respect to the musical [[bar (music)|bar]].
* [[Ballroom dance|Ballroom]] Cha Cha and [[street dance|street]] Cha Cha in  [[Cuba]] count  &quot;two-three-chachacha&quot;
* [[Country and Western dance|Country/western Cha-cha-cha]] and Latin [[street dance|street]] Cha-cha-cha in many places other than Cuba count &quot;one-two-chachacha&quot; or &quot;chachacha-three-four&quot;.

Cha Cha is either danced to authentic [[Latin music]], or more contemporary [[Latin Pop]] or [[Rock en español|Latin Rock]]. The music is energetic and with a steady 4/4 beat.

See ''[[Cha-cha-cha]]'' article for the history of the music.

==Tone of the Dance==

The cha cha is a lively, sassy, groovy dance.

==Let Go==

Most Cha Cha steps are danced in one of two holds, closed and open.

In closed hold the man places his right hand on the woman's left shoulder blade while she lightly rests her hand on his right arm. He then holds her right hand with his left at eye level.

In open hold the man holds the woman's left hand in his right and her right hand in his left, at about waist height.

==Steps==

Many institutions (such as the [[w:International Dance Teachers Association|IDTA]]) have strictly defined names for some steps. This is less important for social dancing and many studios have developed their own names.  Therefore the names below may be very different than those you are used to.

==General Technique Tips==

===Footwork===

Steps in all directions should be taken first with the ball of the foot in contact with the floor, and then with the heel lowering when the weight is fully transferred. When weight is released from a foot, the heel should release first, allowing the toe to maintain contact with the floor. Feet should be placed a comfortable distance from the base (i.e. below the hips), not too close as a full movement cannot be developed, and not too large as this makes it difficult to keep up with the music.

===Legs===

In general, the basic technique taught to beginners is to keep the supporting leg straight. A more advanced dancer however might like to try to keep both legs as straight as possible throughout the dance. As with all Latin dances, knees and thighs should pass one another quite tightly, and though feet should be turned out, this should not be to the extent of exposing the inner thigh. If the inner thigh is exposed the legs can bow, and an undesirable gap between legs is often visible, breaking the line from head to toe.

===Hips===

For a cha cha, hips should move smoothly. In [[American Rhythm]] style, hip movement is achieved through the alternate bending and straightening action of the knees. In [[International Latin]] style, the weighted leg should be straight. The free leg will bend, allowing the hips to naturally settle into the direction of the weighted leg. As a step is taken, a free leg will straighten the instant before it receives weight. It should then remain straight until it is completely free of weight again.

In general, hips should not rise or fall, but stay on approximately the same horizontal level. The bottom half of the body (i.e. navel down) should be isolated from the chest and shoulders, which should remain primarily still. 

===Timing===

International Ballroom dancing usually begins with a prep step on count 1, break on count 2 and cha cha cha on 4 and 1.  Beginners often have a difficult time hearing the latter rhythm or adding in the prep step.  Breaking on counts one and two followed by the cha cha cha on counts 3 and 4 is often more natural for some people and is perfectly acceptable for Country Western, social, and beginning dancers.

===Notes=== 
Cha Cha Cha Chasses may be replaced by: Lock Step Fwd, Lock Step Bwd, Hip Twist Chasse, Crossover Chasse, Ronde Chasse, Ronde Close Chasse, Open Hip Twist Chasse and Forward and Backward Runs where applicable.

{{wrongtitle|title=OS/2}}

{{wikipedia|OS/2}}
OS/2 is an operating system from IBM and Microsoft, that was intended as the successor to MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows.

=== OS/2 1.0 ===
The first version of OS/2 uses a command line interface similar to that of MS-DOS. Unlike MS-DOS, it uses a protected mode kernel and dynamic linking and supports multitasking of native OS/2 applications, which use the same &quot;New Executable&quot; as 16-bit Windows applications, although the two APIs are incompatible. It also can run a single MS-DOS application at a time. This involves forcing the processor back into real mode.

=== OS/2 1.1, OS/2 1.2, OS/2 1.3 ===
OS/2 1.1 added the Presentation Manager, a graphical user interface visually similar to Windows 2.0. Presentation Manager also expanded the OS/2 API.

OS/2 1.2 added the High Performance File System (HPFS), which allows filenames up to 255 characters and eliminated several other filename restrictions of the older File Allocation Table (FAT) file system. OS/2 1.2 also updated the appearance of Presentation Manager, creating the visual style more commonly associated with the later, more popular Windows 3.0. OS/2 1.3 is a bug-fix release.

== Shape Key? ==
Shape keys are modifications of the original mesh that you can animate and mix with each other. Previously called Relative Vertex Keys (RVK), one of their major uses is to create facial expressions.

[[Image:Generi_RVK.gif]]

The idea behind Shape keys is simple. The basic, undeformed mesh you start with is the '''&quot;Basis&quot;''' shape. You can add a variety of different versions of this shape and store each one as a Shape Key for use in an animation (other software sometimes refers to these as &quot;morph targets&quot;). You can't add or delete vertices as Shape Keys only store the positions of vertices and not the creation/deletion of them. 

Ok, to start out, take a plane. I'll add a new shape to it and move a vertex away:

[[Image:First_key_1.jpg]]

When I play with the influence, this key has over the basic shape, the result will be as follows (0.5 in this example):

[[Image:First_key_2.jpg]]

If I play with the slider from 0 to 1, Blender will gradually apply the Key 1 shape with a constantly varying amount of deformation. So from 0 to 1, it will slide from the basis shape to the Key 1 shape. The movement of the vertices is linear from start position to end position and you can even set an influence greater than 1 or lower than 0 and Blender will extrapolate the movements of the vertices relative to the basis shape (marked as a dotted line above). This feature allows you to set general shapes such as a smile and then exaggerate the shape without needing to remake it.

----

== Shape Keys step-by-step ==
Here's a hand-held walk-through of how shape keys are used.

Start with the default cube or a more interesting mesh of your choice.

1: Select your object in '''Object mode'''. Go to '''F9 Editing''' window. Find and select the &quot;'''Shapes'''&quot; panel. Press the &quot;'''Add Shape key'''&quot; button. This adds a key called &quot;'''Basis'''&quot; and this stores the &quot;''basic''&quot; mesh in its undeformed state. Make sure the &quot;'''Relative'''&quot; button is pressed (should be default).

2: Press the &quot;'''Add Shape key'''&quot; button again. It now says &quot;'''Key 1'''&quot; and you have a slider and some other settings. Go into '''Edit Mode''', grab a vertex and move it. '''Exit Edit Mode'''. The mesh returns to normal but you've just added a real Shape key and Blender has stored it.

3: Repeat step 2 for as many different shapes as you like. You can rename the keys to whatever you want. Normally you create each new shape by first selecting the &quot;Basis&quot; key but if you select an existing key from the list and immediately press &quot;Add Shape Key&quot; then enter Edit Mode, the mesh will already be deformed. This is useful for making similar but unique keys. 

===Using Shape Keys===
1: Starting on frame 1, select each key one by one from the pop-up list ''(or go to the Action Window, press the sliders button and select the Keys from the list there)'' and click on the slider and move the slider forward then back to zero. Sometimes just clicking on the slider at the zero point is enough to set the key.

2: Move forward ten frames, select Key 1 from the list and move the slider to 1.00. You'll see your object deform. Move more frames and slide another key. And so on and so on. You can move them forwards and/or backwards as you move through the frames and they'll just add together if they have to. Each time you move the slider, you set a keyframe for that Shape Key.

''Setting Shape Keys''

=== IMPORTANT NOTE: ===
You should add shape keys to a finished mesh. Don't work on a mirrored mesh or a partially finished model. Adding geometry (vertices, faces, loops, joining etc...) can result in the loss of the shape keys or to unpredicatable results. Not always, but probably when you least expect it. There are scripts available to make some of these things possible.

That's the basics. Note that shapes will constantly transform between keys so if you set a key at frame 1 to zero and at frame 10 you set the slider to 1 then at frame 5 the slider will be at 0.5 - which you may or may not want.  If you want it to hold shape for a while before changing ''(e.g. staying at zero until frame 7)'', you'll need to set a key at the beginning and end of the time frame you want it to stay the same ''(So you would set it a zero at the start, then zero again at frame 7 then to one at frame 10)''. You can also edit the IPO curves ''(use Shapes pop-up)'' to really mess with the transformations.

== Polynomial Interpolation ==
Interpolation is way of extending discrete data points to a function.  If the given data points are in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; then polynomial interpolation is common.  The main idea behind polynomial interpolation is that given ''n''+1 discrete data points there exits a unique polynomial of order ''n'' that fits those data points.  A polynomial of lower order is not generally possible and a polynomial of higher order is not unique.  If the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;p(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_{1}x+a_{0}&lt;/math&gt;
then the unknown coefficients can be solved for with the system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
x_0^n &amp; x_0^{n-1} &amp; x_0^{n-2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_0 &amp; 1 \\
x_1^n &amp; x_1^{n-1} &amp; x_1^{n-2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_1 &amp; 1 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
x_n^n &amp; x_n^{n-1} &amp; x_n^{n-2} &amp; \ldots &amp; x_n &amp; 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a_n \\
a_{n-1} \\
\vdots \\
a_0
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
y_0 \\
y_1 \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_{0}\ldots x_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are the given data points.  The matrix in the system is known as the Vandermonde matrix.  Assume all of the data points are distinct the Vandermonde matrix is nonsingular and therefore the system can be uniquely solved.  

If the number of data points being interpolated on becomes large the degree of the polynomial will become large which may result in oscillations between data points and an increase in error.  For large numbers of data points alternative methods are suggested.

== Radial Basis Functions ==
A common problem in science and engineering is that of multivariate
interpolation of a function ''f'' whose values are known only on a finite set of points. Therefore let
&lt;math&gt; \Omega\subset\mathbf{R}^{d} &lt;/math&gt;
be an open bounded domain. Given a set of distinct points ''X''
and real numbers, the task is to construct a function
&lt;math&gt; s:\mathbf{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; that satisfies the interpolation conditions

:&lt;math&gt; s(x_{i}) = f_{i} &lt;/math&gt;

In the last decades, the approach of radial basis function interpolation
became increasingly popular for problems in which the points in ''X''
are irregularly distributed in space. In its basic form, radial basis 
function interpolation chooses a fixed function
&lt;math&gt; \phi:\mathbf{R_{+}}\rightarrow\mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt;
and defines an interpolant by
&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, for 
&lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; one chooses usually the euclidian norm, and 
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a ''radial basis function''.

We see that the approximating function
''s'' is a linear combination of radially symmetric functions, 
each centered on a definite point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;. The points  
&lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;
often called the ''centers'' or ''collocation points'' of the RBF interpolant. 
This approach goes back to Hardy,
who used as early as 1971 the multi-quadric RBF to reconstruct geographical
surfaces from a set of scattered measurements.
Note also that the centers &lt;math&gt; x_{i} &lt;/math&gt; can be located at arbitrary
points in the domain, and do not require a grid. For certain RBF exponential
convergence has been shown. Radial basis functions were successfully
applied to problems as diverse as computer graphics, neural networks,
for the solution of differential equations via collocation methods
and many other problems.

Other popular choices for &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; comprise the Gaussian function and
the so called thin plate splines, invented by Duchon in the 1970s. Thin plate splines result from the
solution of a variational problem. The advantage of the thin plate
splines is that their conditioning is invariant under scalings. Another
class of functions are Wendland's compactly supported RBF, which are
relevant because they lead to a sparse interpolation matrix, and thus
the resulting linear system can be solved efficiently. However, the
conditioning of the problem gets worse with the number of centers.
When interpolating with RBF of global support, the matrix ''A''
usually becomes ill-conditioned with an increasing number of centers.
Gaussians, multi-quadrics and inverse multi-quadrics are infinitely smooth and involve a ''scale''- or ''shape parameter'', &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0.
\ref{fig:var-eps2} for the Gaussian RBF with different values of
&lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Decreasing &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; tends to flatten the basis function.
For a given function, the quality of approximation may strongly depend on this
parameter. In particular, increasing &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
has the effect of better conditioning (the separation distance &lt;math&gt;q_{X}:=
min\,\,\Vert x_{j}-x_{k}\Vert&lt;/math&gt; of the scaled points increases).

Solving the interpolation problem results in the linear system of equations
:&lt;math&gt; A c = f &lt;/math&gt;
with
&lt;math&gt; a_{ij}=\phi(\| x_{i}-x_{j}\|), c=(c_{j})_{j=1,...,N}, f=(f_{j})_{j=1,...,N}. &lt;/math&gt;
. Because only the distance between
the points appears in ''A'', the effort to solve the system is
independent of the spatial dimension, which becomes important especially
when interpolating in higher dimensions. Franke
posed in 1982 the question whether the matrix ''A'' is nonsingular
and thus a unique interpolant is guaranteed to exist for any choice
of ''f''. A few years later, this conjecture was proven true for
a number of useful RBF independently by results of Micchelli
and Madych and Nelson. The only requirement is
that there are at least two centers and that all centers are distinct.
An exception are the thin plate splines, for which the matrix ''A''
can be singular for nontrivial distributions of points. For example, if the points
&lt;math&gt; x_{2},...,x_{n} &lt;/math&gt; are distributed on the unit sphere around the center
&lt;math&gt; x_{1} &lt;/math&gt;, then the first row and column consists
of zeros. A remedy for this problem is to add to the interpolant a
polynomial ''p'' of degree &lt;math&gt;m\geq1&lt;/math&gt;, so that the interpolant becomes 

:&lt;math&gt;
s(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{i}\phi(\| x-x_{j}\|)+p(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and to require that the node points are ''unisolvent'' (for &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{d}^{m} &lt;/math&gt;), that means every polynomial
&lt;math&gt; p \in \Pi_{d}^{m} &lt;/math&gt; is determined by its values on ''X''.
&lt;math&gt; p \in \Pi_{d}^{m} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the space of all polynomials in ''n'' variables up to degree ''m''
and the &lt;math&gt;p_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are the standard basis polynomials for this space. 
A point set is unisolvent for &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{0}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; if all points are distinct,
unisolvent for &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{1}^{d}&lt;/math&gt; of not all points are arranged on one
line. 

The interpolation conditions are now 

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\phi(\Vert x_{i}-x_{j}\Vert)+\sum_{j=1}^{l}d_{j}p_{j}(x_{i})=f_{i},\qquad i=1,...,N&lt;/math&gt;

Because the interpolation conditions result in ''N'' equations
in ''N + l'' unknowns, the system is under-determined. Therefore,
extra side conditions are imposed, which represent the property of
''polynomial reproduction''. This
means that if the data comes from a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathcal{P}_{m}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;f_{i}=p(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt;, then, the interpolant ''s'' must coincide with ''p''. These conditions
amount to

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{l}d_{j}p_{j}(x_{i})=0,\quad1\leq i\leq l.&lt;/math&gt;

To find ''c'' and ''d,'' we need to solve the linear systems

:&lt;math&gt;A\, c+P\, d=f,\qquad P^{T}c=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}=p_{j}(x_{i})&lt;/math&gt; and ''A'' is defined as above. The
equations may be summarized as


The system has a unique solution, if the function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; belongs
to the following class of functions.

'''Definition''' A continuous function
&lt;math&gt;\Phi:\mathbf{R}^{d}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''conditionally
positive definite'' of order m, shortly &lt;math&gt;\Phi\in CPDm&lt;/math&gt; if for
every set &lt;math&gt;X=\{ x_{1},...,x_{N}\}\subset\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of distinct points
and for every set of complex values &lt;math&gt;\{ c_{1},...,c_{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; for which

:&lt;math&gt;P\,\, c=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}p(x_{j})=0\qquad for\, all\, p\in\Pi_{m}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;

''the quadratic form''

:&lt;math&gt;c\,\, A\,\, c^{T}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}c_{j}c_{k}\Phi(x_{j}-x_{k})\geq0&lt;/math&gt;

is positive. If, additionally &lt;math&gt;c\,\, A\,\, c^{T}=0&lt;/math&gt;
implies &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be strictly
CPD of order m. For &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be positive
definite.

A radial basis function &lt;math&gt;\phi(\| x-y\|)=\Phi(x-y)&lt;/math&gt; is called conditionally
positive definite if the corresponding multivariate function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
is conditionally positive definite.

If a function is positive definite, then also the corresponding interpolation
matrix is positive definite. TPS and MQ are conditionally positive
definite functions, Gau, IMQ and Wen are positive definite functions.

Beside the proof of the problem to be well posed, a proof of the convergence
is necessary. However, the convergence is guaranteed for most RBF
only for global interpolation on infinite square grids. For the thin
plate splines, also convergence proofs for local interpolation are
known.

== The Generalized Hermite Interpolation Problem ==

The interpolation problem can also be expressed in terms of
point evaluations i.e. applications of the Dirac delta functionals
acting on the function ''f''.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space
then the Dirac delta functional &lt;math&gt;\delta_{x}&lt;/math&gt;
corresponding to ''x'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{x}(f)=f(x),\quad f\in\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;



The data is generated via

:&lt;math&gt;f_{j}=\int f(x)\delta(x-x_{j})dx&lt;/math&gt;

As before, let &lt;math&gt;\{ x_{1},...,x_{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; be the centers. More generally,
the data can be generated by any set of linear functionals &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{N}&lt;/math&gt;
acting on some function ''f''. The distributions need to be independent
in order to avoid redundant data. The &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are not restricted
to point evaluations, but can be arbitrary linear functionals including
differentiations and difference operators. This problem includes Hermite
functions and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}'&lt;/math&gt; the set of all distributions of compact
support. To a distribution &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathcal{E}'&lt;/math&gt; corresponds a
linear functional, which is acting on &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; via the convolution
of distributions. It can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda,f)=\int(\lambda*f)(x)dx=\int f(y)\lambda(x-y)dy&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the task is to interpolate given the data, &lt;math&gt;f_{i}=(\lambda_{i},f)&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;s=\Phi*\lambda+p&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda_{i},s)=f_{i},\quad for\,\, i=1,...,N&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the interpolant is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;s(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}c_{j}\lambda_{j}^{y}\phi(\Vert x-y\Vert)+p(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where, the &lt;math&gt;c_{j}&lt;/math&gt;'s are suitable real coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{j}^{y}&lt;/math&gt;
indicates that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is acting on the &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; viewed as a function
of the argument |y.''

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{N}\lambda_{j}(p)\phi_{j}(x)=\lambda(p),\quad for\, all\, p\in\mathcal{P}_{m}^{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The entries of the interpolation matrix &lt;math&gt;A=(a)_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; in \ref{eq:rbf-lgs}
are now given by

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij}=\lambda^{x}\lambda^{y}\phi(\Vert x-y\Vert)&lt;/math&gt;


If the number of linear functionals equals the number of centers and
if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the class of conditionally positive definite
functions, then a unique solution does exist.

Shouldn't this start off with the more general case (3D, no assumptions about relative size of M1 and M2, etc), and then from that, drive the 2-body relative motion equation.  Rather than just say &quot;The polar equation for the body's motion is...&quot;.  --[[User:D'Arby|D'Arby]] 22:31, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
:The text should definitely build from a case with no relative size assumptions, but we could go back even further depending on the scope we want for the book. Perhaps it would be best to first define the scope. --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 17:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganization ==

The information in this chapter is presented in an odd way. The discussion starts with Newton, moves to Kepler, then back to Newton. The information should be presented chronologically starting with Kepler's laws then moving on to Newton's (especially since Kepler's laws are pretty much directly responsible for Newton's publication of the ''Principia''). I will start working on this after I finish some work on the coordinate systems chapter.

I don't like starting off by saying what Kepler's Laws are &quot;caused by&quot;.  That material should be presented after Keplers laws have been derived from Newton's laws.  Maybe in an aside &quot;Kepler's Laws Revisited&quot; or something like that.  If we're going to start off with Kepler's laws, some statement needs to be made that they were empirically determined.  --[[User:D'Arby|D'Arby]] 23:09, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

We need to decide which pages belong to this [[Astrodynamics]] book, and rename those pages to start with &quot;Astrodynamics/&quot; in their name, so that there is no confusion. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:Looking through the TOC, I dont think there are any naming convention problems with this book anymore. I have removed the tag. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

== Derivative notation? ==

I already posted this in the [[Astrodynamics/Motion_Constants|Motion Constants]] chapter, but I figured I should mention it again on the main discussion page:

Is there any particular reason why the &quot;prime&quot; notation is being used instead of &quot;dot&quot; notation for derivatives, i.e. &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}&lt;/math&gt;?

Dot notation (aka Newton notation) is generally used for time derivatives and it is consistently used in probably all of the texts I have on the topic of this book (Bate,Mueller&amp;White, etc). It is also slightly more aesthetic, but that is just my opinion

Hmmm...my obversation with Spanish is that, while not as common as boy-words (masculine words), feminine words are quite common, e.g:  La mesa (table), la computadora (computer), la silla (chair), la taza (mug), la escuela (school), la noche (night), la verdad (truth), la foto (short for fotografía) (photograph)  [[User:Samiam|Samiam]] 00:30, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rather than using a guillotine to cut a books pages all at once, a plane can be constructed to slice pages a few at a time, with many cuts all on the same plane.  Douglas Jones described making such a plane from a wood chisel:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I attached the chisel to my plowing jig with a pair of countersunk wood screws that grasped the narrowest part of the shank of the chisel between the handle and flat part of the blade. Most of the flat part of the blade is countersunk into the body of the jig in a slot I cut with the same chisel. The final adjustment of the blade height is critical. I do this by trial and error, adding scraps of paper behind the chisel blade or shank, as needed, to bring the flat of the blade exactly into the plane of the bottom of the jig.

In retrospect, I should have made one jaw of the clamp about twice as thick as the other, because by the time I've plowed off half the pages, the far end of the jig holding the chisel falls off the jaw of the clamp and it's a bit harder to keep the cutting edge of the chisel exactly on the plane I'm trying to follow. The problem isn't serious enough to make me go back and make a new clamp, though.

It is crucial that your chisel be very sharp, and there must be no bevel at all on the flat side of the blade! Careless sharpening will frequently put a slight bevel on the flat side, and this will make your plowing ride up as you work across the book instead of allowing you to hold to the plane established by the jaws of your book clamp. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Idiyappam''' (rice noodles) is a South Indian food, usually served for breakfast.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup raw [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] (i.e., not roasted flour)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (hot water preferred by some)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste 
 
== Procedure ==
# Mix rice flour with hot water, ghee and salt 
# Knead it into a smooth dough. 
# Fill it in an idiyappam presser/sieve and press it onto banana leaves on which a little grated coconut has been sprinkled, or press it directly onto an [[Cookbook:Idli Pan|idli pan]] without banana leaves.
# Steam for 5-10 minutes. Some people add a little grated coconut on top before steaming.

Idiyappams may be served with egg curry or brown chickpea (kadala) curry. In some places it is eaten dipped in fresh coconut milk mixed with sugar.

Stirred cocktails are drinks such as Martinis, Manhattans, and Gimlets.  They are stronger than highballs and typically are 4 oz. (120 mL) of liquid.

Stirred cocktails can be served straight up, without ice; or on the rocks, with ice.  In either case, the drink is mixed with ice and then strained; drinks on the rocks are strained into a glass with fresh ice.  Stirred cocktails should be strained into a glass with a stem so that they keep cold longer, especially when served straight-up; a [[Bartending/Glassware#Cocktail|cocktail glass]] is exactly this.

==Making a stirred cocktail==
To prepare a stirred, follow the below directions.

* Fill a 12 oz. (350 mL) [[Bartending/Glassware|shaker glass]] two-thirds full with [[Bartending/Mixers|ice]].
* Add ingredients from smallest to largest amount, so that if you pour in too much you don't have to discard a whole drink.
* Stir very well.
* Strain the drink into a serving glass.  For drinks on the rocks, strain into a glass with fresh ice; for drinks straight up, strain into an empty glass.
* Garnish as necessary.

You can add the smallest ingredient before the ice; this is recommended for drinks such as Martinis, where you have to add a very small amount of dry vermouth.

Stirred cocktails can also be prepared as [[Bartending/Cocktails|shaken cocktails]] in many cases; this may mix the drink better, but it may also make it cloudy.  Shaking can also chip or break up the ice, increasing the water content of a drink.  Stirred drinks should be stirred unless the patron requests it be shaken.  As a rule of thumb, drinks made entirely of clear ingredients should be stirred, while drinks containing other ingredients such as fruit juice or egg white should be shaken.

I’ve been told I'm an old soul, but I don’t believe in soul. So I guess I'm wise. 21 years old, and I'm an inventor, animator, artists, musician, composer, writer, philosopher, and an outlet of useless information. I know a little bit about almost everything. but im an animator by trade.

im going to contribute to this site in as many ways as i can.</text>

Lesen hause esed mikri, pro ke li ligne por konstrukta lu had mus bli porta per veture trans multi mailes. Esed quar mures, planche e tekte, kel fad un chambre; e disi chambre kontenad rustosi aspektenti forne, armore por li plates, table, tri o quar stules, e li lites.

Esed totim nuli mansarde, e nuli kelere – exept mikri true fosat in li tere, nomat siklone-kelere, vor li familie poved vada tikas ke un de ti grandi tordo-ventes did eventa, sat fortosi por destrukte irgi strukture in sen vie. On arivad a lu per trape mid li planche, fro kel skale dukted subu en li mikri, sinlumosi true.

[[File:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 012.png|150px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kand Dorothy stead in li porte e regardad sirku, la poved vida nulu exept li grandi, grisi stepe an chaki latere. Nek arbre ni hause rupted li larji extensione de plani lande kel arivad al borde del siele ye omni direktiones. Li sune had baka li plugat lande en grisi mase, kun mikri krakos kursent tra lu. Even li gasone non esed verdi, pro ke li sune had brula li kulmines del longi folies til ke lus esed li sami, grisi kolore kel blid vida omnilok. Unfoy li hause had es piktet, ma li sune desligad li farbe e li pluves lavad lu for, e nun li hause esed matud e grisi kom omni altru.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kand Tanta Em venid habita dar la esed yuni, beleti marita. Li sune e vente had chanja anke la. Lus had prenda li sintile ek lan okules e livad lus sobre griseso; lus had prenda li redeso fro lan vanges e labies, e lus anke esed grisi. Kand Dorothy, kel esed orfane, unesmim venid a la, Tanta Em had es talim alarmat per li pueren rido ke la kriad e presed sen manu a sur sen kordie kand unque Dorothyn gayi voise arivad a lan oreles; e la ankore regardad li mikri puera surprisatim pro ke la poved trova irgu pri kel ye rida.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Onklo Henry nulitem ridad. Lo laborad multim fro matine til nokte e non savad te kel joyo esed. Lo esed grisi anke, fro sen longi barbe til sen rudi butes, e lo aspektad severi e soleni, e rarim parlad.

[[File:Wizoz house.jpg|150px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Esed Toto kel kausad Dorothy rida, e salvad la fro deveno tam grisi kam lan sirkumdantus. Toto non esed grisi; lo esed mikri, nigri hunde, kun longi, silkatri piles e mikri, nigri okules kel brilietad gayim an chaki latere de lon komiki, mikri nase. Toto ludad durant li toti jorne, e Dorothy ludad kun lo, e amad lo karim.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Disdi, tamen, les non ludad. Onklo Henry sidad sur li porte-stone e regardad pavoretosim li siele, kel esed ankore plu grisi kam ordinarim. Dorothy stead in li porte kun Toto in sen brases, e regardad anke li siele. Tanta Em esed lavant li plates.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ek li ferni norde les audid basi ululo del vente, e Onkla Henry e Dorothy poved vida vor li longi gasone ondad devan li venienti sturme. Nun venid akuti siflo in li aere fro li sude, e kand les turnad sen okules vers ti direktione les vidad ruges in li gasone venient anke fro ti direktione.

Subitim Onklo Henry steeskad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Siklone veni, Em,“ lo vokad a sen marita. ”Me vada sorga li animales.” Tand lo kursed vers li hangares vor li boves e kavales esed tenat. 

Tanta Em haltad sen laboro e venid al porte. Un regardesko montrad a la li tre proximi danjere.

”Rapidim, Dorothy!”, la klamad.”Kurse al kelere!”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Toto saltad ek Dorothyn brases e kashad se sub li lite, e li puera komensad  riprenda lo. Tanta Em, tre pavorosi, jetad aperti li trape in li planche e klimad subu per li skale en li mikri, deslumosi true. Dorothy kaptad Toto finalim e komensad seku sen tanta. Kand la esed mi-trans li chambre venid grandi kriacho fro li vente, e li hause tremblad talim multim ke la perdad sen stea-povo e sideskad subitim a sur li planche.

[[File:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 014.png|150px]]

Tand stranju eventad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li hause rotad rapidim dufoy o trifoy e lentim levad se tra li aere. Dorothy sentid quasi la vadad supru in balone.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li nordi e sudi ventes renkontrad mutu vor li hause stead, e fad lu li exakti sentre del siklone. Mid siklone li aere es generalim tranquili, ma li grandi presione del vente an chaki latere levad lu sempre plu alti, til ke lu esed al maxim alti kulmine del siklone; e dar lu restad e blid porta for tra multi mailes tam fasilim kam on vud pove porta plume.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Esed tre deslumosi, e li vente kriachad sirk la, ma Dorothy trovad ke la voyajad kelkigrad fasilim. After li unesmi poki jirationes, e altrfoy kand li hause pentad multim, la sentid quasi la blid bersa dolsim, kom bebe in berse.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Toto non prisad lu. Lo kursed sirk li chambre, nun dislok, nun tilok, aboyant lautim; ma Dorothy sidad totim tranquili sur li planche e vartad por vida tu kel saled eventa.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Unfoy Toto vadad tro proxim li averti trape, e falad inu; e unesmim li mikri puera pensad ke la had perda lo. Ma bald la vidad un ek lon oreles saliant tra li true, pro ke li forti presione del aere suportad lo talim ke lo non poved fala. La reptad til li true, kaptad Toto per li orele, e tirad lo retro en li chambre, aftru klosant li trape por ke nuli plusi aksidentes vud pove eventa.

[[File:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, 016.png|250px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hore after hore pasad for, e lentim Dorothy venkad sen timo; ma la sentid totim solitari, e li vente kriachad talim lautim omnilok sirk la ke la preske devenid surdi. Komensim la questionad se ob la saled bli rupte en pieses kand li hause saled fala ri; ma durant ke li hores pasad e nulu hororisiv eventad, la haltad pavoreta e desised varta kalmim e vida tu kel li future saled porta. Finalim la reptad super li baskulanti planche til sen lite, e lieskad sur lu; e Toto sekud e lieskad apud la.

Malgre li baskulo del hause e li kriacho del vente, Dorothy bald klosad sen okules e dormieskad profundim.

* {{todolink|Guide to Unix|todo-list of Guide to Unix}}

=== Origins ===
I had maintained this list at [[User:Kernigh]], but I am moving it here. I have been contributing to [[Guide to UNIX]] from early October to middle November. It has grown to 34 modules partly because I merged several Wikibooks modules together to form this book. These were:
*[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Guide_to_UNIX&amp;oldid=200060 Guide to UNIX (30 July 2005 revision)]
* [[BSD]], a small stub
* [[Linux]], mostly a list of other Wikibooks and external links
* [[File Compression]], a module abandoned by [[Linux Guide]]
* possibly [[Linux commands]]

Note that [[Linux]] no longer redirects to [[Guide to UNIX/Linux]]; it now points to [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]]. You can look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Guide_to_UNIX/Linux&amp;oldid=238901 Linux (22 September 2005 revision)] to see that page before I changed it. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

=== Redirects ===
I moved several of the [[Guide to UNIX]] chapters. For reference, here is a list of redirects which I created because of page renames. In many cases, this is the only page to link to the redirects. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== comparison between Unix, Unix, and non-Unix ==

''comparison between '''Unix, Unix''', and non-Unix'' does not really make sense.&lt;br&gt;
What is meant by that? ''comparison between Unix, Linux &amp; BSD, and non-Unix'' or ''comparison between Unix, Unix-like, and non-Unix''?

==Guide to Unix Navigation Template==
I propose changing the current template to the one that I made:

Picture of a high-quality Japanese Soroban (Abacus). If memory serves this cost about 6,000 yen.

By depressing the top button as shown, the two horizontal rods move up and down forcing the top row of beads up, and the other beads down. This 'zeros' the abacus.

I took this picture myself, and am making it freely available to the web, so that future generations can know the beauty of looking at a well crafted soroban.

=== Square Root Is Not Negative  ===

We often say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the positive number, which when squared is equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; this is perfectly correct, but if &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} = \sqrt{0} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; which is not positive.  So to be technically correct (which is part of the fun of math) we should say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;b&gt;non-negative&lt;/b&gt; number, which when squared is equal to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

If it is needed to express that a square root may be both positive and negative, you will see &lt;math&gt;\plusmn \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

== Maybe one can get pictures examples ==

Recently I've translated from Spanish to Portuguese the book ''Manual del ábaco Soroban'' by Fernando Tejón ([[http://es.geocities.com/krayono]] ). It's under Creative Commons ([[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/]]) and has used images made from a freeware abacus-emulator. Maybe one can get the same. What do you think about this?

This chapter will discuss some particular RTOS implementations. 
We may use some technical terms described in the [[../Real-Time Operating Systems/]] chapter.

== Requested RTOS ==

Use this page to request or suggest a new chapter about a new RTOS. 

Add new RTOS's here before adding them to the main page. '''Do not''' list an RTOS on the main page if you do not intend on writing a chapter for it yourself. There are far too many different RTOS's in this world to list every instance on the main table of contents, and expect other users to fill in the blanks. Many RTOS are designed for a particular purpose, and few are common enough that other contributors can be expected to have some experience with them.

Many embedded systems have no &quot;operating system&quot; other than a Forth or BASIC interpreter.

== Common embedded operating systems ==

In this book, we discuss these operating systems commonly used in embedded systems:
&lt;!-- this should be the same as on the [[Embedded Systems]] main index. Redundant? --&gt;
&lt;!--Do NOT add OS's to this list if you do not plan to personally start a page for that OS. There are far too many embeddable operating systems in existance for this book to cover all of them. Also, this book is not going to be just a large list of operating systems--Whiteknight--&gt;

For many years, the Palm OS was the defacto RTOS used in hand-held devices, primarily the Palm handheld PDAs. However, Palm has lost a large amount of market share in recent years, and has lost dominance in the PDA market. However, many Palm devices still exist in this world, and an intrepid engineer can still find and use an old palm device as the primary microcontroller for other projects. This page will discuss Palm OS, and--to a lesser extent--Palm PDAs.

Windows CE has been gaining a large market share in the high-end PDA market, and can even be found occasionally on cell phones as well. Windows CE is very similar to other Windows implementations, and actually has a nearly complete implementation of the Win32 programming API for developers to tap into. This page will briefly discuss Windows CE, because further discussions of it are heavily related to discussions of the desktop breeds of Windows, and this book does not have enough scope to discuss windows architecture, the Windows API, or windows programming in general.

Currently, Windows CE implementations ship with the .NET Compact framework. This means that Windows CE applications can be programmed in traditional languages (C, C++, etc.) but also .NET languages such as C# and VB.NET.

== What is an Envelope Filter? ==

{{SideBox|If anybody has some images that they can upload, it would be much better then these ASCII art things.}}

The envelope detector is a simple analog circuit that can be used to find the peaks in a quickly-changing waveform. Envelope detectors are used in a variety of devices, specifically because passing a sinusoid through an envelope detector will suppress the sinusoid.

== Circuit Diagram ==

In essence, an envelope filter has the following diagram:

 o------+------+------o
 +      |      |      +
        \     (c)
 vin    /R     |     vout
        \      |
 -      |      |      -
 o------+------+------o

Where (c) represents a capacitor, and R is a resistor. Under zero input voltage (vin = 0), the capacitor carries no charge, and the resistor carries no current. When vin is increased, the capacitor stores charge until it reaches capacity, and then the capacitor becomes an open circuit. At this point, all current in the circuit is flowing through the resistor, R. As voltage decreases, the capacitor begins to discharge it's stored energy, slowing down the state change in the circuit from high voltage to low voltage.

== Positive Voltages ==

By inserting a diode at the beginning of this circuit, we can negate the effect of a sinusoid, dipping into negative voltage, and forcing the capacitor to discharge faster:

   diode
 o--&gt;|--+------+------o
 +      |      |      +
        \     (c)
 vin    /R     |     vout
        \      |
 -      |      |      -
 o------+------+------o

== Purpose of Envelope Filters ==

Envelope filters help to find the outer bound of a signal that is changing in amplitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Composting toilet'''

Put sawdust or some other dry material (like newspaper) in after each 'dump'.
Urine can be very smelly!  
Using separate areas for urine and feces can reduce the stench!   
Wash hands thoroughly after using...disease can spread easily.
Locate the latrines some ways from camp and away from water sources.

'''Standard Outhouse'''

Use a simple enclosure to provide privacy.
The best method of reducing the normal unpleasantness is to have a bucket of wood ash and to put one scoop in after relieving yourself.  This method assists in eliminating moisture and smell.  

After the outhouse fills to within a foot of the ground level fill in the top of the pit and clearly mark the area so that no one accidentally falls in.  The ground should be very firm due to the addition of the wood ash over time.

'''Spread the Waste - do it like they do on discovery channel'''

What is the reason, that makes human waste stink?! Think of a water toilet. The waste is flushed down into the ducts. Well, where you drop it, it won't stink - but think of the collected &quot;broth&quot; in the ducts....

What other toilets do you know of?! Well the outhouse...everybody loves it. The light, dampy smell... Especially when it is a public outhouse like the ones you find out there next to the trails - it will definitely stink.

But there still is an increase. The small plastic outhouses used on construction sites! A skunk is nothing compared to them - placed in the summer sun. 

So far, so good. What is the problem of the toilets mentioned above?! What is the solution?!

Well, it is pretty simple. The above toilets use water, chemicals and cumulate the human waste. That produces a condition close to be perfect for '''putrefaction'''! The only thing to get rid of the stench is: keep it airy, dry and don't cumulate!

My way to achieve that is: create a nice and ''dry'' spot somewhere in the shrubs. Make a circle on the ground and call it &quot;drop-off-ground&quot;. This is where your waste goes. After &quot;dropping-off&quot; take a wooden stick and roll the waste in the dust to cover it a bit. After that you go playing golf: spread the waste into the back of the shrub. Use your wooden stick as a golf club. Make sure you choose different directions. This way you creating '''compost'''. No bad smell at all! It smells like nice humus soil. If you use toilet paper, don't spread the paper. Separate it from the waste and dig a hole to put it in. For comfort and style lean a stick to a tree, so you can yourself lean back for a nice drop-off. This toilet works perfect for long-term use. If you use it for more than three people, use a second toilet and swap them regularly - so the environment has the chance to regenerate. 

Don't forget to designate the back of the shrub to be a &quot;no-go-area&quot;! 

So remember: '''keep it airy, dry and don't cumulate. No putrefaction, but compost'''. 

I heard of someone that uses a sieve to strain the waste (don't cumulate), puts saw-dust on it and is airing it by a ventilator (keep it dry). He is also separating the fluids (urine) from the rest of the waste by using a bypass: a bottle and a hose. This composting-toilet is for indoor-use. It needs cleaning from time to time, power of course (for the ventilator) and that are the reasons I personally don't like it. :o) I like to watch the stars, the birds and other wildlife while pausing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Practice makes perfect, and in the judge's eyes, this speech should be close to flawless. Absolute effiency is important and presentation helps a good bit as well. Depending on the political orientation of the 1AC, differing structures are used to present the content.

For the right (what is traditionally seen as policy debate, claiming things like hegemony, terrorism, ''etc''.)-
Inherency- prove that your plan is not in the status quo
Harms/advantages- prove that there is a problem now and the reason why bad things could happen is because the plan is not in effect.
Plan text- Usually this is formatted by saying the resolution of the year, then state your plan action after it.
   Ex. Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially decrease its authority to detain without charge by having the United States Supreme Court overturn Kormatsu v. the United States in the first available test case.
Solvency- this section should be about how the plan is going to be able to stop the harms from happening.

For the left(known better as critical)-
usually the inherency is told by reading a story of a person that would be affected by the plan.
Next the 1AC launches into a criticism on the way things are now and how we should stop it from happening by implementing the affirmative plan. Usually the plans are questionably topical. Also there is no concrete part of a critical 1AC because the presentation should be entirely fluid.

==New sections/parts==

I've made a new page Java_Programming/Beginning_Java, I think it's a good idea to start moving/modifying/adding pages to it, so that the links appear as Java_Programming/Beginning_Java/Pages_Go_Here, but I don't know if this is the best option so waiting for the green light from major authors before I start work on it. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 13:16, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

==Willing to edit==

Hi I've been working on this book the past couple of days, just getting my head around it. There's a few things I'd like to discuss concerning the project. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:48, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

===Aims===
&lt;p&gt;Something I see as one of the most important issues: I'm not sure there are any clear aims in this book, I think that the general idea is to design the book as a reference and a book for new comers in Java and programming, but I don't think this really shows, at the moment its a mass of jumbled writings to do with Java, but this is a start, all we need to do now is define a solid book purpose or aim and then we can start really tackling the layout and writing style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the book (from what I gather) as I mentioned before is geared towards being a reference book and also something for beginners. This might be difficult to achieve because if we go into depth about the java language, newbies will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say we want to take them through variables, which is one of the first things they'll learn about, and we start talking about static variables, then they could get lost because to really understand static variables you need to understand object orientation, which is something they'll learn about later. But then for people who are using the book as a reference they may find it helpful for it to talk about static declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash; [[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:48, 17 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;hr /&gt;
: &lt;p&gt;I agree with what you have said regarding the aim of the book not being clearly defined and structured. What I feel lacking in this book is, in actuality, the decent progression from beginner level topics to advanced. This book clearly needs to adopt a difficulty progression. I believe we should start discussing about the organisation of the book as soon as is possible and begin implementing it simultaneously. I also would strongly like to get ''rid'' of all the templates (e.g., content templates, content sub-categories templates, template for keywords within code snippets, etcetera) being used by this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion that I would like to make here is the inclusion of short tutorial-like progressive build-ups of code snippets for every topic being discussed. This would ensure that the reading comes natural and easy to the reader. Plus, I find definitions of keywords and techniques in separate paragraphs or notes, rather than flowing within text, very misleading for the beginners. We can work on a separate glossary for every thing at the end of the book for quick references.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash; [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 23:20, 21 February 2010 (UTC)&lt;hr /&gt;
:: &lt;p&gt;Hi there, thanks for your reply, sorry I have been away from wikibooks for a while due to life commitments. I agree with your statements concerning a progression through topics, from beginner through to advance. I think a major mistake that can be made is constructing a book while trying to cater all audiences &lt;i&gt;at once&lt;/i&gt;, while constructing a tutorial, it's very easy to include everything on that topic rather than just the bare details a person of a certain expertise needs to know at that point in their progression. So major consideration is needed to what is included in a topic and what is left to be mentioned at a higher level, allowing more focus on teaching those at that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sort of ideas do in fact need a major overhaul of the book structure and layout. I found it quite confusing trying to navigate around, so I agree with the deletion of all the templates, I don't know if there is an easier method of maintaining the structure of a book without turning it into a completely flat hierarchy (or should we turn it into a flat hierarchy?). I hope there is some sort of framework for the ordering of pages, chapters, sections etc, where just changing one item would reorder them (keeping the ordering to just one area), being a programmer I always see code maintainability of utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a natural step forward would be to construct (at least) three sections of the book: Beginner, Intermediate and Advance, with glossary and indexes at the back, introduction at the front plus all other gubbins and extra sections that we can decide upon at a later period. The major problem will be deciding upon the level of expertise needed for a certain topic.&lt;/p&gt;--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 04:03, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

===Style and Conventions===
&lt;p&gt;Although mainly cosmetic, I think a consistent style should be met throughout the book. This is concerning code examples, notes, warnings etc. Here is what I propose.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:48, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

====Code examples====
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code examples, one which displays just a small snippet of code, and another which displays a whole program or file. I think the snippets can just be held within the source tags, but sometimes I think it could be tidier if they were surrounded with a box, but it seems like a lot of effort employing css overrides(please correct me if I'm wrong).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full program and file example should definitely be held within a box, with the file name at the top, line numbers down the left hand side, and alternating striped colours for the lines, take a look at [http://pastebin.com pastebin] and some of their codes. &lt;s&gt;This would need an external stylesheet&lt;/s&gt;. Ok after a little looking around I figured out what templates are and how to use them, and found Template:Code, nearly exactly what I needed, so I modified it and made a new Template:Java_Code_File, ready to be used.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:49, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

====Template:Java_Code_File====
For full java examples, where the whole file is written, I think this should be used, the following syntax is used:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Java_Code_File
| header=NameOfJavaFile
| source=All code here
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
For more info you can check out [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Java_Code_File Template:Java_Code_File] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Code Template:Code]. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 00:51, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

====Other====
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other things like warnings and notes I quite often see in programming books that can be used in this book (the C++ book seems to use them too) Notes can be highlighted with a neutral colour like blue or green, with a notebook icon at the left, and warnings more of a orange or red colour with a exclamation mark in a triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 15:49, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

==Learning Styles==
&lt;p&gt;Learning styles is something I've learnt about in my current course and I think could be helpful to be applied to this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole idea revolves around how people learn differently, although different people learn through a variety of different methods, quite often you can find their learning styles fall into one (or more) of three different categories&lt;/p&gt;

===Auditory Learners===
&lt;p&gt;These learn best from hearing, so recorded messages stick a lot better; there's not much we can do for this group really, obviously due to the fact a book doesn't talk, maybe if we keep in mind the book may be transcribed to an audio book at a certain point in time&lt;/p&gt;

===Visual Learners===
&lt;p&gt;People who fall into this category always learn best from seeing; diagrams, pictures, flow charts, any sort of visual aid to the book could prove very handy for this type of learner.&lt;/p&gt;

===Kinesthetic Learners===
&lt;p&gt;People who learn best by doing; if we give the opportunity for the readers write out example programs, and then go a step further and give them ideas on how to expand on the program on their own, this could benefit these sort of learners invaluably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on learning styles, visit 
[http://www.ldpride.net/learningstyles.MI.htm here], or take a look at the wikipedia page.&lt;/p&gt;--[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 14:21, 6 March 2010 (UTC)

==Seam==
I've been working with Seam recently (teaching myself) and figure that I could help others as well making a manual of sorts as I go along.  I started one over at [http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=StartingWithSeamAGuideForBeginners the JBoss Wiki], but their default syntax (CamelCase) is just brutal to work with.  Any objections to having its root at [[Seam]]? [[User:Oberiko|Oberiko]] ([[User talk:Oberiko|talk]]) 03:07, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

Interesting, I thought that the front-end should be separated from the back-end(EJB). I don't know how Seam is doing the integration, I'll check it out. Thanks. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] ([[User talk:Ervinn|talk]]) 20:37, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

==New Editor==
I just took a Java class this quarter, kind of fell in love with programming it, and decided to start adding some content to this book.  Just thought I'd introduce myself! - [[User:Ceclauson|Ceclauson]] ([[User talk:Ceclauson|talk]]) 05:30, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

:Welcome Ceclauson, I think your contributions could be valuable for this book. I have been away from this WikiBook for a while but since I see that this needs proper clean-up, I'd love to assist you in writing this book. You can as well talk on my project page regarding content you want to add to this book and how you'd love to structure it. I would be more than grateful. [[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 02:29, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

==Questions about licences and screenshots==
I added some screenshots to a page I did on swing (an I think it looks pretty good), but I think there are some copyright issues with the images, and that they'll be deleted unless this can be fixed.  Does anyone know anything about this who can help?

--[[User:Ceclauson|Ceclauson]] ([[User talk:Ceclauson|talk]]) 20:09, 7 March 2008 (UTC)

== Conventions ==

Some conventions would suit the book, so here comes a proposal, to be edited as you see fit.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Convention
! Statement
! Note
|-
| Source code tag
| Java source should be entered using &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source=&quot;java&quot;&gt;..&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|-
| Level of indentiation
| The level of indentation of Java examples should be 3.
|
|}
These should help those editors who would like to stick to them. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:24, 6 April 2008 (UTC)

== Model Wikibook ==

It would be nice to have some model Wikibooks, from which to learn.

:I think the page is really well written, my best bet is it's place would be in back matter of the book, most of what is described on the page should be explained over a period of time in the progression of the whole book, but saying that, for intermediate users of Java I think that page would be of great help for them for a quite lookup of various topics, they may know what a statement does and want to use it, but maybe they don't know exactly how, instead of making their way through the whole book, they can refer to this page instead. --[[User:Mattylaws|Mattylaws]] ([[User talk:Mattylaws|talk]]) 12:36, 10 March 2010 (UTC)

== merge ==

I suggest merging [[The Way of the Program]] into [[Java Programming]].
As far as I can tell, both books have exactly the same scope (Java programming)
and target audience (people that don't know any programming language yet).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:05, 5 June 2009 (UTC)
: Well to be honest it mentions other programming languages and has one chapter in Java. Maybe the chapter on Java can be merged with the Java Programming book, and then new chapters can be written for C, C++, FORTRAN, and other languages mentioned in the book. The way I see it, this book was written for programming like a computer scientist in general, and then included a chapter on Java. Most likely because most college programming classes use Java as an example (When I took computer science we used Turbo Pascal, and then later Turbo C, and then other colleges use Visual BASIC or GNU C++, but now it seems to be Java because it is platform independent and it runs in web browsers via the Java plugin, etc.) The O'Reilly Headstart series seems to default to Java as well for the same reason in teaching how to start out in programming.

In rough order a list of topics that shall be taught in the book (though not necisarily the titles of indidvidual pages). I see the Beggining_Java section to be the part of the book that deals with the base structure of the Java Programming, so excludes topics concerning the API.

Feel free to add to or reorder this list

* Program Flow
* Statements
* Expressions
* Methods
* Logic
* Naming conventions
* Packages (and general file and folder naming and organisation)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up until the advent of VLSI, there were basically two different types of computers, General Character based computers, and Large word Number Crunchers. But when VLSI brought the unit cost of computing down low enough, people began to think in terms of specialized computers, designed and built to do one thing well. One group of people, decided to design a personal computer, something that could be used by novices, and would work just as well as a more complex computer. Another group wanted to transfer artificial intelligence programs to more compact robots instead of hooking up the robot to a mainframe. Rather than install a program with thousands of lines of code on these machines they wanted to keep the complexity and cost of their systems down. Of course by now, we are seeing computers being integrated into our phones, but the designers still want to keep their costs down.

One way of keeping the cost down, was to integrate a few basic operating system commands into an interpreted language. Languages where this was successfully done include: BASIC, Lisp, Smalltalk, and JAVA.

=== BASIC ===

The first known case of this happening was the Altair kit computer, which was programmed by Microsoft with a program called &quot;Stand Alone Basic&quot;. Essentially, Stand Alone Basic was a basic interpreter with operating system commands integrated into the language so that you didn't need a separate operating system. Although I haven't seen this version, I did see a similar program on the Commodore 64, which integrated a number of commands such as Load, Run, Continue, Stop and Reset, as well as Peek and Poke. Essentially, BASIC assumes that anything loaded into it is a BASIC program unless it is loaded using the load absolute variation of the load command. It automatically goes through a lexical analysis, converting each command into a token, and warning the operator if it can't translate a particular command. When the program has been successfully loaded, in token form, it waits for the run command to start. When it is run, it starts at the start of the tokenized program and interprets each token in turn. By promoting some of the commands to keys on the keyboard, it becomes possible to load a program into the computer and run it.

=== Lisp ===

Very soon after Microsoft's success at producing a stand-alone basic program, some A.I. Researchers decided to do a similar thing with LISP. By creating a custom chip, that favored some of the stages in lisp interpretation, they were able to reduce the size of a Lisp based robot significantly. To this day Lisp is used in A.I. programming because as a list processing language, it speeds the processing of list based devices such as rule-bases and expert systems.


=== Smalltalk ===

Smalltalk has the cachet of having an extremely small interpreter. Based on the concept of Object oriented programming it is a very effective language on which to base a dedicated computer. However, Object oriented programming is difficult to learn conceptually, and so Smalltalk computers have never had a large market segment.

=== Java ===

Perhaps the most successful interpretive language when used as an operating system, is the JAVA language. This language is meant to capture the benefits of C, and the benefits of Smalltalk, in a single language. It is based on a Virtual Machine which can be written to run in machine language as easily as in C. By installing the JAVA language right onto silicon, it makes possible sophisticated processing and network services on a very compact unit. In fact, JAVA has been used in Cellular Phones to provide an internet interface to a relatively inexpensive cellular phone circuit.

The following was left in this file by the original author. Possibly as a way of organizing his thoughts about java. I am considering removing it, because it goes into too much detail about Java, and not enough about operating systems.

      <comment>Matt 2:19 says Herod the Great dead before the return of child Jesus to Galilee.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Jesus of Nazareth was a historical person who Christians and their texts claim fulfilled the prophecies of the Jewish expectations of a Messiah, the one Anointed by God to bring about the salvation of mankind and establish the reign of God. He lived his life in the Roman Tributary of Galilee, during the rule of Herod Antipas, and the Province of Judea, during the governorship of Pontius Pilate, by whose order he was beaten, tortured, mocked, and crucified as an enemy of the Roman State. His message is best summarized in the words of the Gospel writers, called the &quot;Evangelists&quot;: &quot;Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.&quot; However, Paul the Apostle would later write in a letter that the summation of Christian belief is in the fact of Jesus, the Son of God, taking on human form, dying on the cross carrying all human sin from the beginning to the end of time, and rising again on the third day, which was witnessed by many.

Thus, it is to be said that Christianity is a religion based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth as recorded the &lt;i&gt; Holy Bible &lt;/i&gt;, which includes the Old Testament or Hebrew Scriptures, about the religious life of the ancient Hebrews, and the New Testament, which contains both stories about the actions of Hebrew religious reformers in the first century AD, including Jesus, his disciples, and the earliest converts, and letters from the most influential of the apostles: Peter, Paul, and John. Collectively, this book is also known as &quot;the Scriptures&quot; or the short form, &quot;Bible&quot;. According to the Bible, there is one (male) God who created the universe from nothing. He favors the morally good, choosing to reveal himself and his universal laws through various holy men known as prophets (those after Moses) and patriarchs (those before and including Moses). This being said, Christians regard the Bible as being a record of what is known as &quot;Salvation History&quot;, beginning with the Creation and Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden (at which time they assert sin and death entered the world), followed by the stories (in order) of Noah and the Great Flood, the call of and promise to Abraham and his descendants, the Exodus from Egypt to Canaan, the establishment of the Israelite nation and the Davidic dynasty, the Exile to Babylon, and the Wisdom and Prophetic Traditions. This story culminates in the story of Jesus' life, death on the cross, and resurrection, where Jesus, as the Son of God, explains the meaning of the Hebrew Scriptures, instructs the subjugated Hebrew people in morality, and performs miracles, which include his own rising from the dead.

The practice of Christianity includes the Sunday church service and special festivals, the most important of which are Easter (celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus), Christmas (the celebration of Christ's birth on December 25), and Pentecost (the celebration of the beginning of the Apostles' ministry). These services always include a particular structure in which parts of the Bible are read to the audience, followed by a short speech from the presbyter, who is known by various titles in each of the different sects, called denominations. These speeches are called sermons or homilies and usually center on guiding the Christian community into a closer relationship with God, which includes moral living, as outlined by the Scriptures. During the Catholic mass the congregation takes communion together using bread and wine in the ritual of transubstantiation. Many Protestant denominations are opposed to drinking alcohol, so these communities will often substitute grape juice for the wine. Despite the difference in drinking preferences, this ritual is universally known as the Eucharistic Rite or the Communion Rite. In addition to the Sunday service, Christians are encouraged to pray everyday, and often do, whether they follow prescribed, such as Rosaries, Chaplets, or the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot;/&quot;Our Father&quot;, or free-form prayers, which usually follow the format of &quot; Father, please do this thing, and we/I will do that pious practice/for the glory of Your Name. We/I ask this in the name of Jesus. Amen.&quot;

It should be noted that some Christian theologians and laymen argue that there is no &quot;essence of Christianity&quot;, per se, because Christianity was formed in a different paradigm than the primarily-Greek paradigm that uses the language of &quot;Essence&quot;. In the early Christian church, the &quot;essence&quot; was reported by some as simply &quot;Jesus is Lord.&quot; Creeds were formed to replace this as a refinement of the statement, and over the centuries countless theologians, mystics, and monks have added to and argued about what the essence of Christianity is. It can be quite clearly seen that the basic love of Jesus was not of a majority point of view, even down to the present day, but Jesus distinguished himself from others by his concern for the weak, the disenfranchised, the revelation of Truth to their oppressors, and the evidence for the hereafter he presented.

A tasty dish made popular by Nathanyay Chang. 

== Ingredients ==
* 4 [[Cookbook:lobster|lobster]] tails
* 2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Jamaican Jerk Spice|jerk seasoning]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2 whole [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]]
* 2 tsps. [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Lime|lime juice]]
* ½ tsp. of Jamaican pickapeppa sauce or 3 drops of Jamaican hot pepper sauce (optional)

== Procedure ==
# Thinly [[Cookbook:Slicing|slice]] the scallions.
# Melt the butter in a small [[Cookbook:skillet|skillet]].
# Lightly [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the scallions until golden.
# Add the lemon juice.
# Add Jamaica pickapeppa sauce or hot pepper sauce (optional, depending on your taste).
# Let it simmer for about 1 minute, then set aside.
# Remove the membrane from the lobster tails.
# Use a sharp knife to split the lobster tail in half lengthwise.
# Brush butter sauce onto each tail.
# Using the same brush, spread the jerk sauce over the tails, especially on the exposed meat. Set oven to broil.
# Put the lobster tails in oven on the meat side for 4 minutes, turn, and cook the shell side for 2 minutes.
# If you want a more smoked taste, cook for 2 minutes on each side in the oven, then place on a barbecue grill for 3 minutes. You may need to add more jerk sauce if using a grill.
# Serve with Jamaican festival and/or bammy. You can also serve with Jamaican hardo bread.

'''Mofongo''' is a popular Caribbean dish which originated in Puerto Rico, and later has been adapted to Dominican cuisine. It is made from fried green plantains, seasoned with garlic, olive oil and pork cracklings, then mashed. Mofongo is usually served with a fried meat and a chicken broth soup.

==Ingredients==

*3 [[Cookbook:Plantain|plantains]] -- very green
*½ pound pork rinds, also known as chicharrones or pork cracklings -- ground (note: packaged pork rinds can be used. And any kind of bacon can also be used.)
*3 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*1 cup stock or broth 
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] for frying

==Procedure==
#Peel the plantains and cut into 1-inch diagonal pieces. 
#Heat the oil in a large skillet. Place the plantains in the oil and fry on both sides; approximately 3 1/2 minutes per side. 
#Remove the plantains from the pan and flatten the plantains by placing a plate over the fried plantains and pressing down. 
#Then return them to the hot oil and fry 1 minute on each side. Then place on paper towel. 
#Mince garlic
#While the plantains are still hot use a mortar and pestle to mash them with the minced garlic, olive oil, and stock or broth. Add the chicharrones, salt and pepper to taste.
#You can also use a food processor – add the plantains to food processor with bacon, garlic and some salt and pepper. You may have to work in batches. Process to consistency of mashed — not whipped — potatoes. Do not over process!

This seems to be a recipe rather than an explanation of what mostaccioli is, which if I recall, isn't really wikipedia's sort of thing... maybe one of the sister projects?  Not sure.  Someone that knows more than n00bish me needs to weigh-in I think, but it really does need an explanation of what it is at least.  Wish I could write it!  -Graptor</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Winkler test''' is used to determine the level of dissolved oxygen in ''fresh'' water samples. What follows is a set of instructions on how to perform the test.
==Materials== 

===Stage 1=== 
*Manganese(II) sulfate 48%
*Potassium iodide 15% in potassium hydroxide 70% 
*Sample of fresh water
*Latex gloves
*Safety glasses

===Stage 2=== 
*Sulfuric acid 50%
*Sodium thiosulfate 0.31%
*Starch making up solutions|solution 0.1%
*Burette
*Burette stand
*10 ml pipette and pipette filler
*100 ml conical flasks
*Filter paper
*Latex gloves
*Safety glasses

==Method==

===Stage 1=== 

Collect and label water samples in 25 ml stoppered bottles. (Two samples per location are required for Biological Oxygen Demand testing.) &lt;br&gt;
Add 0.1 ml of manganese(II) sulfate solution, and mix carefully, without letting in air. Add 0.2 ml of alkaline potassium iodide, and again mix without letting in air. A pinky-brown precipitate should appear.&lt;br&gt;
At this point the sample may be stored for later analysis in the laboratory.

===Stage 2=== 

Add 0.3 ml sulfuric acid to each sample, and mix. Allow the sample to stand for two minutes. If the precipitate does not dissolve into iodine solution, add a further 0.1 ml acid. Fill the burette with thiosulfate solution and adjust to zero (or note the burette reading). Transfer 10 ml of the sample to a conical flask, and add a few drops of starch solution. The subsample should turn blue. Titrate the subsample with thiosulfate until it turns clear. (You may find the endpoint easier to see if the conical flask is stood on a sheet of filter paper.) Record and repeat the titration.

==Notes==

Each milliliter of thiosulfate titer is equivalent to 0.1 mg of oxygen in the 10 ml subsample. Thus 1 ml of thiosulfate is equivalent to 1 mg oxygen per 100 ml fresh water.

To determine five-day Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), several dilutions of a sample are analyzed for dissolved oxygen before and after a five-day incubation at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) in the dark. In some cases the sample must be provided a source of oxygen-using bacteria, called &quot;seed&quot;, in order to obtain results. The difference in DO and the dilution factor are used to calculated BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting number (usually reported in parts per million or milligrams per Liter) is useful in determining the relative organic strength of sewage or other polluted waters.

The BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; test is an example of analysis that determines classes of materials in a sample. 

Instrumental methods for measurement of Dissolved Oxygen have widely supplanted the routine use of the Winkler test, although it is still widely used to check instrument calibration.

The description of the procedure seems like it is different from the Winkler titrations I did over 20 years ago. Is it older or newer? Any water professionals with more recent lab experience? -- [[User:WCFrancis|WCFrancis]] 01:35, 11 May 2005 (UTC)
:For over thirty years, the sample size used in water/wastewater labs (esp for utilities) has typically been 300 milliLiter, the standard size of a BOD bottle. I have not felt inclined to correct this either here or there yet, not having time since my work as a water professional has been very demanding lately. I need to do something called research, which some folks editting here don't seem to always do with adequate care. [[User:WCFrancis|WCFrancis]] 00:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
=Edit question=
Although this is here, it is difficult to locate since the title begins &quot;Transwiki&quot;. How can that be corrected easily? Move or copy to new article? I will soon &quot;be '''bold'''&quot;, like a bull in a china shop. *grin* [[User:WCFrancis|WCFrancis]] 01:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==
In a food chain, plants are usually the producers, which means they can make food by themselves. They make food by carrying out photosynthesis, then storing the food made in the form of starch.


===Aim=== 
The aim of the experiment is to compare a covered part of a leaf to an uncovered part of a leaf to see whether plants produce starch

==Equipment==
*Beaker                                 
*Test tube
*Water 200 ml	        
*Boiling water any amount that doesn't exceed 600 ml                 
*Ethanol 5 ml
*White tile
*Iodine solution 3 drops
*Safety Goggles  
*Leaves
*Bunsen burner
*Apron
*safety mat
*gauze
*tripod
*forceps or tweezers
*glass rod

==Safety procedures==
*Wear safety goggles              
*Keep ethanol away from Bunsen burner; ethanol is flammable
*Tie  the hair back
*Tuck ties, files and loose material away
*Keep all bags out of the way to avoid tripping up.
*Make sure you are not wearing tight clothes

==Method==
#Set up the equipment.After follow the steps below.
#Place a beaker of hot water in the hot water bath. When the water has boiled add the leaf that had been in light.
#Wait 3 minutes for the leaf to boil (this is to get rid of the waterproof layer and break the open cells and make it soft). 
# Take out the leaf using the forceps. 
#Put the leaf in a boiling tube and cover with ethanol.
#Put the tube of ethanol plus leaf into the beaker of hot water WITHOUT the bunsen burner on as ethanol is highly flammable.
#Dip the leaf back into the hot water, using the forceps.This is done to get the ethanol off the leaf. 
#Spread the leaf out on the tile using the glass rod. Add about five drops of iodine solution on to the leaf and observe. 
#Carefully draw a diagram of the leaf marking any areas that have stained black.

==Results==
From this experiment, you will discover that leaves contain starch in the black parts of the leaf. But originally where the green parts of the leaf were present starch is available in lesser quantity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__

Methylene Blue may not be suited for storing in classrooms (especially for younger students) due to health hazards if swallowed. The following method allows for a nice staining of onion cell nuclei using normal fountain pen ink. I have used this staining method with students, and after a short demonstration the students were able to conduct the experiment themselves. Only very little alcohol and ink is needed for each student (max 5 ml alcohol and 5 drops of ink per student or group). Success, of course, also depends on microscopy experience, maturity and class size.

==Materials==

#alcohol
#water based ink, not the one used for calligraphy, as this one contains particles of carbon that can not enter the cells. Blue fountain pen ink worked fine for me
#water
#slides and cover slip
#microscope
#onion
#small beakers for alcohol and water
#tweezers

==Method==

# Take a piece of onion and peel off the membrane using tweezers or your fingernails. 
# Put the membrane into alcohol for about 30 s. This will pull out the water of the cells. The membrane will become stiff a bit.
# Put the membrane into beaker with ink for about 30 s. The ink is waterbased and will therefore enter the dehydrated cells. The membrane will stain dark blue.
# Wash the membrane in water until no more ink comes out (about 1 min). Both cytoplasm and the nuclei are still stained blue. We need to remove the excess ink from the cytoplasm.
# Put the membrane into a small beaker with alcohol for 30 s. Excessive fluid (and ink) is removed from the cytoplasm. The nucei are retaining their color.
# Put the membrane into clear water for 30 s. The cytoplasm swells up again.
# Repeat the washing steps 5 and 6 once more. After each washing the cells become lighter as they lose more color. 
# Put the membrane on a slide, add a drop of water and put on the cover slip.

The nuclei of the cells should be clearly visible. If the cytoplasm is still to dark (the whole cell is blue), repeat the washing steps 5 and 6 again. If the nuclei are not visible, then the cells were probably washed too many times and the color was removed from the nuclei as well. In this case shorten the washing times in step 5 and 6 or do not repeat these steps too often. If done well, it is even possible to see two darker dots in each nucleus (the nucleoli?).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Screaming jelly babies''' is a chemistry demonstration which is practised in schools all over the United Kingdom. It is often used at open evenings to demonstrate just how much fun secondary school science can be. 

This demonstration nicely shows just how much energy there is in a &quot;jelly baby&quot;. Potassium chlorate is a very strong oxidizing agent that oxidises the sugar in the jelly baby all at once. The following text gives an explanation of how to perform the experiment. This should only be done by an experienced chemist or chemistry teacher.

== Safety ==

#Make sure test tube is completely clean. Any trace of an oxidisable material can cause an explosion.
#Surround the apparatus with safety screens.
#Ensure the pupils/audience are seated several metres away and that they are wearing eye protection.

== You will need ==

*Jelly babies
*Large test tubes
*Clamp Stand (retort stand)
*Potassium chlorate
*Tongs
*Access to a fume cupboard
*Bunsen burner
*Safety goggles
*Fire resistant surface

== Method ==

1)Put 12-15g potassium chlorate in large test tube. 
2)Clamp the tube in a clamp stand at approx. 60° (just off the vertical) then melt the powder with a Bunsen burner. Make sure you are wearing safety goggles.
3)Turn the Bunsen off, then, using tongs and wearing heat resistant gloves stand to the side of your boiling tube, drop in the jelly baby and stand well back.

== Results ==

If you follow the instructions above precisely then the jelly baby should burst into flames with a strange, high pitched noise (screaming). There will also be a lot of smoke so open a window. Do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; touch the boiling tube for at least 5 minutes unless you would like burned fingers or you have protection on.

Wow, what a terribly dangerous experiment. 

&lt;em&gt;I've seen it done loads of times without any problems.It is definately a demo for chemistry teachers rather than pupils which is why I've added the safety warning to the chemistry experiment page&lt;/em&gt;

Maybe the Wikipedia would be better served with chemistry experiments that don't involve heating unstable chemicals until they melt...

&lt;em&gt;personally I'm in favour of just adding information to wikipedia and not worrying how best to serve it. Although you do have a point. So far in wikipedia, not many experiments have been added at all. Lot's of science info, but no practical advice. I suppose we do have some responsibility towards potential readers. I'd hate to be in anyway responsible for someone getting hurt. Yet, to self-censure info goes against the grain for me. It's also IMO against the whole idea of an encyclopaedia, which is supposed to represent &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; knowledge not just the knowledge which is safe to know. I suppose the solution is to add safety warnings and suggest alternative chemicals on the page. &lt;/em&gt;


And does this really need its own page? Might be better to just expand the &quot;Chemistry practicals&quot; page...

&lt;em&gt; I'm hoping that the chemistry practicals page will grow into a very long list. Besides with it's own page it can be linked to pages on energy in food etc.&lt;/em&gt;

: I think it's brilliant! :) Except that... is it really an ''encyclopaedia article''? It seems to me that an article would say something like, &quot;The '''screaming jelly babies experiment''' is a demonstration of the oxidizing power of potassium chlorate, first performed in 1827 by Michael Faraday,&quot; or something along those lines - describing what the experiment is, rather than giving instructions on how to do it. I wouldn't have thought that an encyclopaedia should be an instruction manual. But then again, I've seen quite a few things like this - recipes and so on - so maybe there is a consensus to allow such things... -- [[User:Oliver Pereira|Oliver P.]] 19:33 Feb 12, 2003 (UTC)

:: I agree with Oliver. It needs a bit of a tweak to read more like an encyclopedia article. A backlink to [[Chemistry practicals]] would be good too... though [[Chemistry practicals]] needs renaming -- [[User:Tarquin|Tarquin]] 21:31 Feb 12, 2003 (UTC)


::: &lt;em&gt;Ok I've added an itro to make it partially more like a typical article. As for renaming chemistry practicals I was thinking of renaming it School Chemistry experiments and demonstrations, and doing the same with physics and biology practicals - what do you think? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]&lt;/em&gt;

Encyclopedic or note, this is an excellent article in that it enlightens and visualises a somewhat abstract aspect like energy in the food we eat. On a related not: in the UK an expert had a &quot;show&quot; where he would dunk a Digestive biscuit in liquid oxygen and then set fire to it with a match. Flames were spectacular and presumably people would think twice before pigging out on sweets.

I thought I should mention, that the Virtual School page, linked to in this article. It is no more, it says they're done with the project if you go there.</text>

A '''Pineapple Upside-Down Cake''' is a cake with pineapple rings or pieces baked in the top.  It is called an upside down cake because it is made with the pineapple at the bottom and then turned over.  There are several recipes for such a cake:

This article has two sections. The first section, &quot;History&quot;, is taken entirely from a third-party source and may be copyvio (and even if it's not, long excerpts don't belong in Wikipedia anyway). The second section, &quot;Recipes&quot;, belongs in [[Wikibooks:Cookbook]]. So I'm going to delete the first section and then mark the article to be transwiki'd to Wikibooks. &amp;mdash;[[User:Caesura|Caesura]][[User_talk:Caesura|&lt;sup&gt;(t)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:29, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

This is a description of how to use '''paper chromatography of amino acids''' (to identify amino acids).

* To demonstrate separation of amino acids by paper chromatography
* To use chromatography to identify amino acids

== Materials ==

* Chromatography tank and lid
* Chromatography paper (or filter paper), to fit tank
* Capillary tubes or pasteur pipettes
* Amino acid samples in 1 molar hydrochloric acid (IRRITANT)
* Unknown samples (e.g. 'unknown' mix or filtered fruit juice)
* Solvent (BAW): Butan-1-ol : Acetic acid : Water  60 : 15 : 25 (FLAMMABLE, TOXIC)
* Hairdryer or heating tray
* Spray can of Indanetrione (Ninhydrin) 1% in butan-1-ol (FLAMMABLE, TOXIC)
* Latex gloves
* Access to fume cupboard
* Drying oven at 100&amp;deg;C

== Methods ==

BAW solvent should be made up fresh on the day

Using a pencil, lightly draw a line 1.5&amp;ndash;2 cm above the bottom of the chromatography paper. Make small marks at 1.5 cm intervals along the line.

Fill a capillary tube or pipette by capillary action with your first sample. Touch the tip of the capillary to the first mark and pull it away. You should leave a small (&gt;5 mm) wet spot. Let this dry and apply the sample again. Make a note of which sample is placed on the spot (you can lightly write on the paper beneath the mark, using a pencil). Repeat for each sample or mixture, on a different mark and using a fresh tube or pipette each time. Let the paper dry.

Put 1 cm or less of BAW into the chromatography tank. The sample spots should not dip into the solvent. Place the tank in a cool place out of direct sunlight. Stand the chromatography paper in the tank so that the bottom edge is in the solvent but the remaining paper does not touch the tank. Place the lid on the tank and leave for about 1 hour.

Wearing gloves, remove the damp paper and mark where the solvent has reached. Dry the paper in the fume cupboard. Still in the fume cupboard, spray the whole of the paper with ninhydrin in butanol. Dry the paper and transfer it to the drying oven for 1&amp;ndash;2 min.

Mark the position of each spot that develops. Note the colour and Rf (or travel distance) of each standard and hence find the amino acid composition of the unknown samples.

== Hazards ==

* Acetic acid
:*Irritant vapour. On skin; flood with water. Ventilate area.
* Butan-1-ol
:*Highly flammable. Remove ignition sources
:*Harmful by inhalation. Irritant vapour. Use fume cupboard.
* Hydrochloric acid 1 molar
:*Irritant, may cause burns. On skin; flood with water. Spills, neutralise with sodium bicarbonate.
* Indanetrione
:*Irritant. Wear gloves. Indanetrione, spilt on the skin, is not immediately noticeable. It stains skin purple, slowly, and even seems to work through gloves. Wash frequently to remove it.
* Hot Oven; also produces Butan-1-ol fumes.
:*Remove papers wearing gloves, or use forceps. Ventilate area

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[image:Microscope_slide.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Microscope slides and cover slips. A single, 3-inch long glass slide is shown with a cover glass in place]]

A microscope slide is a thin sheet of glass used to hold objects for examination under a microscope. A standard microscope slide (shown on the right) is 75 x 25 mm (3&quot; X 1&quot;) and 1.2 mm thick. A range of other sizes is available for various special purposes.

Since compound or high power microscopes have a very narrow region within which they focus, the object to be viewed (&quot;specimen&quot;) should typically be placed on the middle of the slide with another, much thinner square (or circle or rectangle) of glass placed over the specimen.  This smaller sheet of glass, called a '''cover slip''' or '''cover glass''', is usually between 18 and 25 mm on a side. The cover glass serves two purposes: (1) it protects the microscope's objective lens from contacting the specimen, and (2) it creates an even thickness (in wet mounts) for viewing. 

== Wet mount ==

Many objects that are going to be viewed on a microscope slide need to be prepared as a '''wet mount''' using water. Other materials are used when a permanent slide is being prepared for viewing and storage. In a ''wet mount'', the specimen is placed at the center of the slide with one (or two) drops of water and the cover glass placed over the specimen. In some preparations (such as looking at pond water for microscopic critters), the object being prepared for viewing is contained within water. Special slides are available for viewing mounts that require more than one or two drops of water.

Once the specimen and water are combined on the slide, the cover glass is added.  The cover glass should be placed at an angle to the slide, one edge touching the slide, and then lowered as if hinged there.  If done properly, the water will force out any air as the cover glass closes over it, and no bubbles will be trapped beneath the glass. Although an occasional bubble might be tolerated, large numbers will make viewing the specimen difficult. Adhesive forces between the liquid and the glass will hold the cover glass firmly in place.  Generally, only one drop of water is sufficient. Adding too much water will create a problem, as the affixing of the cover slip to the slide will depend on much weaker cohesive forces (see &quot;Problems and solutions&quot; below).

There should be no excess water (water outside the cover slip) and the cover slip should remain in place when the slide is moved to the '''stage''' of the microscope, where it is held in place by '''stage clips''' or some other holding mechanism. 

=== Problems and solutions === 
* Mostly air under cover slip &amp;ndash; too little water was used (increase by 1 drop) or cover glass was improperly dropped onto specimen. Adding a drop of water to the slide at the very edge of the cover glass will result in water being taken in under the cover glass (capillary effect).  If numerous air spaces are still evident, it is best to start over.
* Too much liquid under cover slip &amp;ndash; cover glass slides around easily on glass slide, and may fall off if slide not held perfectly level. Using a small piece of absorbent paper (paper towel or tissue), touch edge of paper to excess water at edge of cover slip; repeat until cover glass affixes to the slide. 
* Cover slip &quot;rocks&quot; on specimen or is clearly not laying flat &amp;ndash; either the specimen or something in the sample (a grain of sand for example) is preventing the cover slip from coming down far enough to adhere to the slide. Focusing on this slide will be difficult. Possibly the specimen is not thin enough or evenly sliced. If a grain is present, remove it and re-mount the specimen.

== Graticule slide ==
[[image:Graticule.png|thumb|97px|right|Vector|rasterized grid (low quality)]]
The text above describes a standard microscope slide. However, there are many special purpose slides.  For example, a '''[[School Science/Graticule slides|graticule slide]]''' is a microscope slide that is marked with a grid of lines (for example, a 1 mm grid) that allow the size of objects seen under magnification to be easily estimated. Such grids are perhaps more often employed in counting exercises.

[[Image:Make an onion cell slide.png|right|frame|''Fig. 1''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''dye, pin, onion membrane, slide, and cover slip''&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[Image:Microscope diagram.png|right|frame|''Fig. 2''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''A simple student's microscope''&lt;/small&gt;]]

Tissue from an onion is a good first exercise in using the microscope and viewing plant cells. The cells are easily visible under a microscope and the preparation of a thin section is straight forward. An onion is made of layers, each separated by a thin skin or membrane. In this exercise you will make a '''wet mount''' on a microscope slide and look at the cells of the onion membrane magnified by the '''high power, compound microscope'''.
==Method==
#First add a  few drops of water or solution on the microscope slide to avoid dryness and wilting
#Take a small piece of onion and using forceps (tweezers), peel off the membrane from the underside (the rough side).
#Lay the membrane flat on the surface of the slide
#Add a drop of Iodine solution to the onion epidermis.
#Using a pin, lower the thin glass '''cover slip''' or cover glass onto the slide. Make sure there are no air bubbles (Fig. 1).
#Make sure the lowest power objective lens (the shortest lens if there are several present) is in line with the optical tube, and the microscope light is turned on. Then place the prepared slide onto the stage of the microscope.
#Looking from the side (NOT through the eyepiece), lower the tube using the coarse focus knob until the end of the objective lens is just above the cover glass. Do this carefully so as not to crack the cover glass (and possibly damage the objective lens).
#Now look through the eyepiece and turn ONLY the smaller, fine focusing knob to move the optical tube upwards until an image comes into focus. The cells should look something like lizard skin.
#Swap the objective lens for a higher powered one so that you can see the cells at greater magnification. You should be able to make out a nucleus in each cell.
#Be very careful; these dyes can stain your skin and clothes.

Proper use of the microscope - intended to prevent damage to the objective lenses - requires that the following techniques be followed:
* Never use the coarse focus knob while looking through the eyepiece.  The point of focus will be very near the cover glass. Looking from the side, &lt;u&gt;lower&lt;/u&gt; the optical tube until the objective lens is as close as you can get it to the cover glass without actually touching it. Starting with the low power objective lens is the fastest way to achieve proper focus. 
* Initially, slowly focus back (turn the fine focus knob to &lt;u&gt;raise&lt;/u&gt; the optical tube) while looking through the eye piece. Once the specimen comes into focus, you can make fine adjustments up or down with the fine focus knob without fear of damaging the slide or the microscope.
* If the specimen does not come into view (does not focus), raise the tube a little with the coarse focus knob and attempt to focus again with the fine focus knob. Once the object is in focus, switching objective lenses (to a higher power) should be possible without any further coarse adjustments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gram_Stain_Anthrax.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gram-positive anthrax bacteria (purple rods) in cerebrospinal fluid sample.  If present, a gram-negative bacterial species would appear pink. (The other cells are white blood cells)]]
Gram staining, or Gram's method, is an empirical method of differentiating bacterial species into two large groups based on the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls.


The method is named after the inventor, the Danish scientist Hans Christian Gram, who developed the technique in 1884 to discriminate between pneumococci and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'' bacteria.

==Uses==
Gram stains are performed on body fluid or biopsy when infection is suspected. It yields results much quicker than culture, and is especially important when infection would make an important difference in the patient's treatment and prognosis; examples are cerebrospinal fluid for meningitis and synovial fluid for septic arthritis. 

==Mechanism==
Gram-positive bacteria have a thick mesh-like cell wall made of peptidoglycan that is capable of retaining the violet dye/iodine complex. Gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall made of a layer of peptidoglycan. In addition to an inner membrane, they also have an outer membrane which contains lipids, and is separated from the cell wall by the periplasmic space.

The decolorizing mixture causes dehydration of the multilayered peptidoglycan in the Gram-positive cell wall, thus decreasing the space between the molecules and causing the cell wall to trap the crystal violet-iodine complex within the cell. But in Gram-negative bacteria, the decolorizing mixture acts as a lipid solvent and dissolves the outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell wall. The thin layer of peptidoglycan is unable to retain the crystal violet-iodine complex and the Gram-negative cell is decolorized. The decolorization step is the crucial one, and requires some degree of skill, as Gram-positivity is not an all-or-none phenomenon.

As a rule of thumb (which has exceptions), Gram-negative bacteria are more dangerous as disease organisms, because their outer membrane is often hidden by a capsule or slime layer which hides the antigens of the cell and so acts as &quot;camouflage&quot; - the human body recognises a foreign body by its antigens; if they are hidden, it becomes harder for the body to detect the invader.  Often the presence of a capsule will increase the virulence of a pathogen. Additionally, Gram-negative bacteria have lipopolysaccharide in their outer membrane.  Lipopolysaccharide is an endotoxin which increases the severity of inflammation. This inflammation may be so severe that septic shock may occur.  Gram-positive infections are generally less severe because the human body does not contain peptidoglycan, and in fact the human body produces an enzyme called lysozyme which attacks the open peptidoglycan layer of Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are also much more susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin.

==Procedure==

===A description of Gram staining===
# First, an inoculum is taken from a culture using an inoculation loop and put on a slide and then allowed to air dry. If the culture is solid, it is diluted by adding a drop of water or sterile saline on the slide and mixing with the loop. It is important here to take a very small inoculum so that the end result is a sparse single layer of bacteria. It is a common mistake for beginners to put far too much inoculum at this step. 
# The specimen is heat-fixed by passing the slide, inoculum side up, through a bunsen flame 1-2 times, without allowing the slide to become hot to the touch.  This prevents the bacteria from being washed away later and it also kills the bacteria.
# A basic dye, crystal violet or gentian violet, is used to stain the slide. This dye is taken up by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Allow to stain for 1 minute. The slide should look purple to the unaided eye, and if examined microscopically at this point both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are purple. Lugol can also be used instead of crystal violet.
# Rinse off with water for a maximum of 5 seconds.
# Add iodine (Gram's iodine) solution (1% iodine, 2% potassium iodide in water) for 1 minute. This acts as a mordant and fixes the dye.
# Rinse with water.
# Apply 95% ethanol or a mixture of acetone and alcohol several times until no more colour appears to come from the sample. This washes away all the unbound basic dye, (usually crystal violet) and leaves Gram-positive organisms stained purple and Gram-negative organisms unstained (colourless).
# Rinse with water immediately to prevent over-decolourisation.
# Apply a suitable counterstain. Opinions vary as to the best choice but suitable stains include safranin or fuchsin. This stain is taken up by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, but does not alter the colour of Gram-positive organism much, as they are already purple. It does, however, make the Gram-negative organisms pinkish-red.
#Blot gently and allow to dry. Do not smear.

===Interpretation===
Inspect the slide under a microscope
* ''Gram-positive'' organisms will appear ''blue-black'' or ''purple''.
* ''Gram-negative'' organisms will appear ''red'' or ''pink''.

Organisms that cannot reliably be differentiated by this staining technique are said to be '''Gram-variable'''

The attention tag was added since the article looks to much of a procedure, and not an encyclopedic article. One solution would be to move the procedure to Wikibooks. Or it could be rewritten. -- [[User:Egil|Egil]] 09:12, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:I think the procedure how gram staining is done is important enought to be mentioned in Wikipedia. Not in a Howto style; listing the basic steps should be enought.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Faux marble''' or '''faux marbling''' is the painting of painting surfaces so as to imitate the appearance of polished marble. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive.

Faux marbling is a special case of '''faux stone painting''', although the distinctive and varied patterns of marble make it the most imitated stone by far.

==History==

Faux stone painting was widely used in Pompeii, but it really took off in Europe during the Renaissance with two schools of faux marbling developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice ten years or more to fully master the art.

Modern professional marblers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to closely imitate real marbles but many decorators are happy to merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone. It is not as difficult to do as it looks. It is perfectly possible for an amateur to produce a beautiful effect with a little practice. 

==How to paint faux marble==


===Materials and equipment===
*White eggshell paint {sometimes known as semigloss of softsheen}
*Boiled linseed oil {Available in the wood treatment section of a &quot;Do-it-Yourself&quot; store. It is used to slow the paint drying time}
*White spirit {to thin the paint and clean the brushes}
*A tube of black artist oil paint. &quot;Lamp black&quot; is nice
*Brushes, one of which should be good quality and very soft.
*Two feathers, the traditional one to use is goose but any large feather will do.
*Some rags or lint-free cloths

===Method===

|}


====Stage 1====
The surface is cleaned then painted with the eggshell paint and left to dry overnight. The following day the surface is painted with a thin layer of linseed oil. This slows the drying time of the paint considerably and therefore keeps it workable. Next the black oil paint is mixed with a little of the white eggshell to produce a light grey tone, which is added here and there over the linseed oil base. Other shades of grey are used to fill in the gaps so there is a swirly pattern of colour.

====Stage 2====
A soft, dry paintbrush {two or three inches wide} is used to soften the colour. A rag is dabbed over the surface to break up the colour and remove excess paint, then the surface is softened again with the dry brush.

====Stage 3====
An artist's brush is used to add a light veining pattern in mid grey. The veins do not cross one another, they do not start or stop suddenly, and they do not fan out from a point. They do go in a diagonal direction, but they are never regular or even. 

Colour can be removed from part of the surface, if required, by dipping the artist's brush in white spirit, and lifting the colour off with the brush. The whole surface is then thoroughly resoftened with a dry brush, or a crumpled cloth.

====Stage 4====
Fine veining is added with a feather. The feather is dipped in white spirits and roughly brushed backwards to separate the bits&lt;!--(&quot;what are they called ?&quot;)--&gt;. Then it is dipped in thin charcoal grey paint and used as a brush to add the fine wiggly veins. Light coloured veins can be added either by dipping a feather into off-white paint or by dipping the feather into white spirits. As it is drawn across the surface the white spirit dissolves the paint underneath and a light vein appears. The whole surface is then gently softened with a very soft brush - traditionally badger hair is used.

This experiment demonstrates the effects of heat and pH on the activity of enzymes.

==Materials required==

Saliva (contains amylases that break down starch), starch, iodine, test tubes, hot plate

==Methods==

Exact amounts should be determined by trial and error.
#Collect some saliva (no mucus) in a beaker. Conduct the experiment in test tubes or small beakers and do not put anything into your mouth to mix with saliva.
#Mix starch with water and boil until solution becomes clear. Cool. This step is necessary to homogenize the starch solution and increase the surface area of the starch for the enzymes to act on.
#Mix starch solution with a small drop of iodine. A positive reaction is indicated by a dark blue/black color.
#Mix starch solution with some saliva. Mix well. Keep at body temperature for several minutes (hold in hand). Amylases in the saliva break down the starch.
#Mix saliva/starch solution with a small drop of iodine. Reaction should be negative.

Here are some variations

#Alternative: Heat up saliva to denature the enzyme before mixing with starch solution. Iodine reaction should be positive for starch.
#Alternative: Mix saliva with acids or bases (e.g. lemon juice for safety) before mixing with starch. This can be used to demonstrate pH sensitivity of the amylase.
#Alternative: Mix saliva first with iodine. Then use the iodine/saliva mixture to test for starch. The iodine possibly inhibits the amylases in the saliva.
#Alternative: Conduct a Benedicts Test to test for simple sugars after starch solution has been treated with saliva. Benedict's test should be positive after addition with saliva. Test results are expected to be negative without addition of saliva or after heat denaturation or pH change of the saliva.

For a briefer demonstration of the enzymatic effect, hold a cracker in your mouth for 60 seconds. The amylases will break down the starch and the cracker will start to taste sweet due to the sugar produced.

This module describes how to create various chemical solutions

==Diluting Concentrated Acids==

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
===&lt;big&gt;'''CAUTIONS'''&lt;/big&gt;===
* '''Only pour &lt;u&gt;Acid Into Water&lt;/u&gt;''', not the other way around, especially with concentrated acids.
:Acids may quickly absorb water, which is exothermic, and can create significant heat. When acid is poured slowly into water, any heat generated should be safely and evenly dissipated in the water. However, if water is poured into acid, the water may quickly reach boiling temperature, with exploding bubbles spraying acid everywhere.
* '''Dilution of concentrated acids should always be done in a [[wikipedia:|fume cupboard]].'''
* Consider the additional '''Safety Notes''' included below for specific acids.
|}


===Hydrochloric acid===

Hydrochloric acid can be supplied as either a 36% or 32% concentrate solution, so carefully check the bottle first.

To make a '''1 molar solution''' (1M):

====36%====

Add 83.5mL of 36% hydrochloric acid to about 600mL of distilled water in a 1 litre measuring cylinder in a fume cupboard. Make up to 1L, mix well, and pour into a labelled bottle.

====32%====

As above, except use 96mL of hydrochloric acid.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
* Concentrated hydrochloric acid is highly corrosive; and
* very irritating to the lungs, wear a face shield and use a fume cupboard.
|}

: 1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 5M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.


===Nitric Acid===

Assuming the concentrated nitric acid is 70%w/v, then to make a 1M solution:

Add 62mL of concentrated nitric acid to about 700mL of water, then dilute to 1L.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
Add the acid slowly, stirring constantly with a polypropylene or glass stirring rod.
If the solution gets too hot (by touch, or noticeable agitation / fuming), stop and let it cool down.
|}

: 0.1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 1M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.


===Sulfuric acid===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
* Concentrated sulfuric acid is highly '''CORROSIVE''', and
* a dehydrating (drying) agent.
* Causes severe burns. It should only be handled under close supervision by an experienced person.
* Wear appropriate gloves.
* Protect the eyes with safety goggles or, even better, a face shield.
* '''Carcinogenic'''.
|}

Slowly add 54mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to about 700mL of iced water, and dilute to 1 litre. This is a 1M solution.

: 1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 4M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.


===Ethanoic acid,  also known as Acetic acid===

The concentrated acid is called Glacial acetic acid as it freezes at 17&amp;deg;C.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
====Safety Notes====
* Glacial acetic acid is '''CORROSIVE''', and
* the vapour is an extreme '''IRRITANT'''.
* Wear appropriate gloves.
* Protect the eyes with safety goggles or, even better, a face shield.
* Work in a fume cupboard.
|}

To make a 1M (mole/litre) solution, add 57mL of the concentrate to about 600mL of distilled water, and dilute to 1 litre.

: 1M (mole/litre) solutions and above should be labelled '''IRRITANT'''.
: 4M solutions and above should also be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.

==Help! It won't dissolve==
Some substances do not dissolve very readily in water and require special methods.

*Sodium alginate
This dissolves &lt;em&gt;very slowly&lt;/em&gt; in water. The best thing to do is to start making it up the day before you need it. Mix the powder into agitated water, then put into the fridge overnight. When you come back in the morning it will have dissolved.
*Starch
In general, starch is insoluble in water, but some types of starch, for example, corn starch will dissolve in water provided they are made into a paste first with cold water then dissolved in boiling water.

*Iron (III) salts
Most iron (III) salts do not form stable aqueous solutions. In order to get them to dissolve you need to add a small amount of acid. Add hydrochloric acid to the chloride, etc.

==Reagents used for testing foodstuffs==

===Biuret reagent===

This is used to test for the presence of protein. There are two recipes the first consists of two reagents Biuret A and Biuret B.
*A is 0.1M sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide the bottle should be labelled '''CORROSIVE'''.
*B is 0.01M copper (II) sulfate solution
For the second (Quantitative) recipe, in about 600mL of distilled water, dissolve in order 3g of copper (II) sulfate · 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 5g of potassium iodide, 9g of potassium sodium tartrate. 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and 8g of sodium hydroxide. Make the dissolved solids to 1 litre. Label the solution '''IRRITANT'''

===Benedict's reagent===
This is used to test for reducing sugars. It has two recipes. Benedict's qualitative and Benedict's quantitative.

====Benedict's Qualitative Reagent====

The reagent is made up by first dissolving 173g of sodium citrate and 100g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in about 600ml of distilled water. Then 17.3g copper (II) sulfate · 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is dissolved in about 100ml of distilled water. The two solutions are then mixed together and when cool are made up to 1L with distilled water.

====Benedict's Quantitative Reagent====

In about 600ml of hot water dissolve
*200g of sodium citrate
*75g sodium carbonate
*125g potassium thiocyanate
In about 100ml of water dissolve
*18g of copper (II) sulfate · 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
When the solutions have cooled, mix them together stirring constantly. Add
*5ml of 5% potassium ferrocyanide then make up to 1L.

==Iodine Solution==

Iodine solution is used to test for starch.
Recipes vary but 1g of iodine plus 1g of potassium iodide in 100mL water is suitable. Dissolve the iodide then the iodine.

==Buffer Solutions==

Buffer solutions help to keep the pH of a sample constant.
Make up 0.1M citric Acid and 0.2M phosphate solutions then mix as follows,

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Citric Acid-Phosphate buffers&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;&gt;pH &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;&gt;0.2M Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; /ml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot;&gt;0.1M Citric Acid /ml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;20.55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;79.45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;38.55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;61.45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;51.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;48.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;63.15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;36.85&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;82.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;background:#eeeeee;&quot;&gt;17.65&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;97.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td &gt;2.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

==Title &quot;Making up solutions&quot; ==

Hm. I kind of dislike the title of this page, because it is vastly ambiguous. On one hand, it can mean &quot;Constructing/building a chemical solution (i.e. water plus a dissolved compound)&quot;, but on the other hand it can also mean &quot;Coming up with bogus answers to problems&quot;. How about ... [[Mixing solutions]]? [[Creating chemical solutions]]? ... -- [[User:Timwi|Timwi]] 05:21, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Anybody who understands chemistry understands the meaning of this title.

:I agree with Timwi, I moved it to &quot;Creating chemical solutions&quot;.--[[User:Patrick|Patrick]] 12:42, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Brilliant!! I'm a lab tech and this information is very, very useful.
Not always readily available on the internet if you have lost the  book and you need to make a solution in a hurry-  if I get time I'll try add to it.

==Solutions by volume or weight==
For true novices, introducing the difference between weight and volume is important. [http://www.sciencecompany.com/lab/test_solns.htm#weight This] page has a decent introduction.

Clogged drains can be a real nuisance. There are a few home-remedies you can try before calling a plumber.

* Products
** Drano
** LiquidPlumber

* Home-Remedies
** Clorox
** Baking Soda
** Use equal amounts of vinegar and baking soda.  Cover drain and let stand for at least one hour then flush with hot water till drain is clear.

*Remedies with tools
**Plunger
**Hose Bladder
**Plumbing Snake

*Industry
**Plumber

== Products ==

Most people start off with a store-bought solution, which may or may not produce results. These products are typically $10-20(US) and be purchased cheapest at hardware stores.

Try using the plunger on the drain after letting it sit 15 minutes, then flushing with hot water while plunging like a crazyman. Make sure to get a good air seal on the plunger over the drain, if one is not obtained, try a bigger plunger.

== Home-Remedies ==

Several people have reported using Clorox bleach and/or Baking Soda instead of the commercial products, yielding better results. 

Another trick, which may or may not work, is to plug up all the drains in the sink with towels, and run a hose full-blast down the drain, in an effort to blow out the clog.


== Remedies with tools ==
If the clog is between your drain and the nearest vent, a plunger can usually be used to loosen a clog, allowing it to continue down the pipe. The hope is that the next pipe is larger and thus it will not create another clog.

If a plunger doesn't work, a water bladder might. Connect the bladder onto a garden hose and insert it into the pipe/drain. When you turn the hose on the bladder will block the drain so the water will build up pressure and push the clog down the pipe. Be careful, though, if the water can find another way out, it will.

Depending on the layout of your pipes, you might be able to feed a snake into it to pull the clog out. Be careful not to damage your appliances, as most snakes are metal with a sharp point. Insert it into the pipe until you cannot push it any further. Then turn it clockwise and it will work its way through the clog. Once there is no more resistance it has breached the clog: gently pull it back and see what the clog was (wear gloves while doing this!)

== Industry Professionals ==

If nothing else, call your local plumber.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This page describes the care of living organisms in a school science laboratory, other than humans.  For this, see human care.

==Plants==

The most common plant to be found in a school science lab is the geranium Pelargonium. They are very easy to grow and tolerate abuse well. They can be propagated from cuttings very easily. Take a section of geranium with one or two smallish leaves and leave in water for two to three weeks. When you see the roots growing, pot into sandy compost. Cuttings should be taken on a regular basis to replace old plants, which tend to become woody and unattractive after a couple of years laboratory abuse. 

Geraniums are good for the following experiments:

* Testing leaves for starch
* Nail varnish impressions of stomata

==Animals==
===Fish pond water===
A good species of fish to keep is the goldfish as they can thrive in cold water. They come in a variety of fancy forms that are quite beautiful. Be careful that you don't keep fancy goldfish in the same tank as regular ones because ordinary goldfish can swim much faster than fancy ones and will kill them.  Furthermore, ordinary goldfish have a bigger diet and are constantly digging food out of the gravel. 

Water snails (Limnaea and others) can be purchased in the UK from a number of suppliers including Blades Biological. You can easily obtain snails from garden ponds and clean canals, or from many pet shops which stock fish. They help to keep a cold water fish tank clean and free of algae. They can be used to investigate respiration and the carbon cycle.

===Stick insects===

Stick insects come in a variety of species and by and large are very easy to keep. Beware some species of stick insect reproduce asexually and you will be overrun with little stick insects unless you remove the eggs. They typically live for about 18 months, and, depending on the species, feed on brambles or privet.

===Woodlice===

Start your own breeding tank: the best way to get woodlice at all times of the year (and no need to go searching under stones if ordered at the last minute). Use a large opaque plastic box with a lid; about 3-5cms of fine soil in the bottom; a couple of lumps of chalk; some clumps of damp cotton wool; a source of food, for example celery, potato, leaves.

According to which type and age range of woodlice you start with they should start breeding within a few weeks or months, although some can take up to two years to reach breeding age. If planning to be used for detailed investigation, only put one species in the tank, unless you want a selection of offspring.

===Daphnia===

Culture Daphnia (Water flea) or Cladoceran in an aerated aquarium filled with freshwater. Allow the water to stand for 24 hours to equilibrate dissolved gases.

Make a suspension of yeast in water, and pipette enough into the aquarium to just give the water a milky tinge. Introduce the Daphnia. When they clear the yeast from the tank, add a similar amount. If the tank is left in daylight, algae can grow on the sunlit side. This can be scraped off and broken up, and added to the diet of yeast. Be sure to change the water completely once a month.

One interesting, if slightly morbid way of cleaning 'green' tropical fish tanks of algae is to remove the fish into a second tank (being sure the second tank is well circulated and set at the appropriate parameters similar to that of the original tank) and add Daphnia to the algal soup. After a couple of weeks, when the Daphnia have eaten the algae, re-introduce the fish. This is also a good demonstration of a food chain in action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Cannon fire''''' is an audio experiment that produces a series of crackles and bangs like gunfire. The noises are produced by [[w:hydrogen peroxide|hydrogen peroxide]] and [[w:Potassium permanganate|potassium manganate(VII)]] reacting to produce [[w:oxygen|oxygen]] which increases the rate of burning of the [[w:ethanol|ethanol]].

==Safety==
*Wear eye protection / full face shield
*Remove any concentrated [[w:sulfuric acid|sulfuric acid]] from the area when using potassium manganate(VII)
*Avoid inhaling any vapour produced
*Be aware of the pale blue / invisble flame that is produced by the burning ethanol

==Required==
*Heatproof surface
*Large [[w:evaporating basin|evaporating basin]] or metal plate
*Safety screens
*[[w:Splint|Splint]]s
*Hydrogen peroxide (20%)
*0.5 g potassium manganate(VII)
*Ethanol

==Method==

#Place 30 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen peroxide and 20 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ethanol into the basin
#Surround the basin with screens and light the mixture with the splint. The ethanol will burn with a pale blue or invisible flame
#Sprinkle 0.5 g of potassium manganate(VII) into the dish

==Notes==
*A fine powdered potassium manganate(VII) will give lots of bangs that are fairly quiet. Coarse powdered potassium manganate(VII) however, will give fewer, louder bangs.

It's worth while covering the benches with heatproof mats or such like, this one can go off. I love it!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A campfire is a fire lit at a campsite, usually in a fire ring. Campfires are a popular feature of camping, particularly among organized campers such as Scouts, Guides or Royal Rangers. Without proper precautions they are also potentially dangerous. A certain degree of skill is needed to properly build a campfire, to keep it going, and to see that it is properly extinguished.

==The dangers==
A campfire may burn out of control in two basic ways: on the ground or in the trees. Dead leaves or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood, or from thermal radiation. Alternatively, airborne embers (or their smaller kin, sparks) may ignite dead material in overhanging branches. This latter threat is less likely, but a fire in a branch will be virtually impossible to put out without firefighting equipment, and may spread more quickly than a ground fire.

Embers may simply fall off of logs and be carried away by the air, or they may be ejected at high speed by exploding pockets of sap. With these dangers in mind, some places prohibit all open fires, particularly during times of the year that are prone to wildfires.

Campfires are prohibited in many public camping areas. Public areas with large tracts of woodland usually have signs indicating the level of fire danger, which usually depends on recent rain and the amount of deadfalls or dry debris; when the danger is highest, all open fires are prohibited. Even in safer times, it is common to require registration and permits to build a campfire. Such areas are often kept under observation by rangers, who will dispatch someone to investigate any unidentified plume of smoke.

==Finding a site, and other safety measures==
Ideally, every fire should be lit in a fire ring. If a fire ring is not available, a temporary fire site may be constructed. One way is to cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, to a depth of a few centimeters. The area of sand should be large enough to safely contain the fire and any pieces of burning wood that may fall out of it. Sand piles should be scattered after the fire has been put out. If the topsoil is moist, it may suffice to simply clear it of any dead plant matter.
Fire rings, however, do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it.

No fire should be lit close to trees, tents or other fire hazards. This includes overhanging branches; some carry dead, dry material that can ignite from a single airborne ember. In addition, a fire may harm any roots under it, even if they are protected by a thin layer of soil. Conifers run a greater risk of root damage, because they lack taproots and their roots run close to the surface.

Fires also should not be lit on bare rocks. The ash will leave a black stain that cannot be easily removed, but the fire's heat can lead to more dramatic consequences. It will cause the outer layer of the rock to expand, possibly causing it to crack. It may also boil pockets of water contained in the rock.

An additional safety measure is to have sand and water on hand to smother and douse the fire if it does get out of the fire pit. It is wise to gather these materials before they are actually needed.

==Types of fuel==
There are, by conventional classification, three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels.
*Tinder is anything that can be lit with a match. The best natural tinder is dead, dry pine needles or grass; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder. A quantity of tinder sufficient to fill one's cupped hands to the top is the bare minimum needed.
*Kindling is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuelwood. In fact, there are gradations of kindling, from sticks thinner than a finger to those as thick as a wrist. A quantity of kindling sufficient to fill a hat may be enough, but more is better.
*Fuelwood ranges from small logs two or three inches across to larger logs that can burn for hours. It is typically impossible to gather without a hatchet or other cutting tool, so fuelwood must usually be brought from home or purchased at a nearby store.

The gathering of fuel in natural areas is often restricted. Cutting of living trees is almost always forbidden - but neither is it very useful, because sap-filled wood does not burn well. Squaw wood (dead parts of standing trees) may also be prohibited. Wood lying on the ground is usually permitted.

==Building the fire==
Having found a suitable site and gathered materials, the fire-builder has a variety of designs to choose from. A good design is very important in the early stages of a fire. Most of them make no mention of fuelwood - in most designs, fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly.

The tipi fire-build is perhaps the best, but it is takes some patience to construct. First, the tinder is piled up in a compact heap. The smaller kindling is arranged around it, like the poles of a tipi. For added strength, it may be possible to lash some of the sticks together. A tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks, so a clove hitch should suffice. (Synthetic rope should be avoided, since it produces pollutants when it burns.) Then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling, taking care not to collapse the tipi. A separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better.

A lean-to fire-build starts with the same pile of tinder as the tipi fire-build. Then, a long, thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle, so that it overhangs the tinder pile. The smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them.

A log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile. The kindling is then stacked around it, as in the construction of a log cabin. The first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other, on opposite sides of the tinder pile. The second pair is laid on top of the first, at right angles to it, and also on opposite sides of the tinder. More kindling is added in the same manner. The smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly. Of all the fire-builds, the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse, but it is also inefficient, because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel.

A variation on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuelwood with a pile of tinder between them, and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling should be burning between two pieces of fuelwood. The logs will eventually catch fire from it.
Another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres. Its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces. If built on a large scale, this type of fire-build collapses in a controlled manner without restricting the air flow.

The traditional Finnish rakovalkea (literally &quot;slit bonfire&quot;) is constructed by placing one long piece of fuelwood atop another, parallel and bolstering them in place with four sturdy posts driven into the ground. (Traditionally, whole unsplit tree trunks are used for the fuelwood.) Kindling and tinder are placed between the logs in sufficient quantity (while avoiding the very ends) to raise the upper log and allow ventilation. The tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts don't burn prematurely. The rakovalkea has two excellent features. First, it burns slowly but steadily when lit; it doesn't require ardous maintenance, but burns for a very long time. A well constructed rakovalkea of two thick logs of two meters in length can warm two lean-to shelters for a whole sleeping shift. The construction means that the logs themselves act as wind-cover! Thus, exposure to smoke is unlikely for the sleepers; nevertheless someone should always watch in case of an emergency. Second, it can be easily scaled to larger sizes (for a feast) limited only by the length of available tree trunks.

==Lighting the fire==
[[Image:Campfire_4213.jpg|thumb|280px|left|A campfire]]
Once the fire is built, the next step is to light the tinder, using either a match or a lighter. A reasonably skillful fire-builder using reasonably good material will only need one match. The tinder will burn brightly, but be reduced to glowing embers within half a minute. If the kindling does not catch fire, the fire-builder must gather more tinder, determine what went wrong and try to fix it.

One of five problems can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or a lack of oxygen. Rain will, of course, douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally do a good job of keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.

Steady, forceful blowing may be in order for a small fire in an enclosed space that has mysteriously slowed down, but blowing may extinguish a fire if it is done abruptly or when it is not needed. Most large fires easily create their own circulation, even in unfavorable conditions, but the variant log-cabin fire-build suffers from a chronic lack of air so long as the initial structure is maintained.

Once the large kindling is burning, all of the kindling should be put on the fire, save for one piece at least a foot long. This piece is useful later to push pieces of fuelwood where they are needed. Once all of the kindling is burning, the fuelwood should be placed on top of it (unless, as in the rakovalkea fire-build, it is already there). For best results, two or more pieces of fuelwood should be leaned against each other, as in the tipi fire-build.

===Without matches===
There are several ways to light a fire without any matches. All of them work with only the lightest and most flammable tinder, such as paper.

On a sunny day, a lens may be used to focus the light onto the tinder. The most suitable lenses are magnifying glasses (included in some compasses), but eyeglasses may also suffice.

The &quot;bow and drill&quot; method is also well-known, but it is a lot of work. The bow is similar to that used for archery. To make such a bow, find a thin rope or flexible but sturdy vine, and a sturdy stick about two feet long. Tie the rope to one end of the stick, and make another knot on the other end of the stick, with the rope between the ends not quite taut. The drill is another straight stick, thin but strong, preferably stripped of bark and with a sharpened end. The center of the bowstring (rope) is wrapped around the drill, with the two sticks at right angles to each other. The end of the drill is placed on a piece of bark in the middle of the tinder. The bow is moved rapidly back and forth to rotate the drill and create heat and friction on the bark. This method works best with an assistant feeding the tinder to the hot spot.

The crudest method of igniting a fire is to strike two hard objects (at least one of them combustible) together to produce a spark, and ignite tinder from the spark. The substances traditionally used to produce sparks are flint and either steel or pyrite. Replacing the steel with ferrocerium (lighter &quot;flint&quot;) produces more sparks with less effort. Rotting wood (punkwood) or charred fuel are sometimes used as tinder when using this method.

==Campfire activities==
[[Image:Cooking snags over campfire.jpg|thumb|250px|Australian &quot;snags&quot; cooking on a campfire]]

Campfires have been used for cooking since time immemorial. However, portable stoves have all but replaced campfires in this regard. For cooking information, see cooking on a campfire. Other practical, though not commonly needed, applications for campfires include drying wet clothing, alleviating hypothermia and use as a distress signal.

Most campfires, though, are lit exclusively for recreation. People tend to find something fascinating about flames and glowing coals, so a campfire is usually an agreeable way to pass the time from dusk to bedtime, particularly for those in a pensive mood. Campfires are also good venues for intimate conversation and storytelling; yarns and stories about poltergeists are particularly popular.

Another traditional campfire activity involves impaling marshmallows on sticks or uncoiled coat hangers, and roasting them over the fire. Roasted marshmallows may also be used for S'mores.

==Extinguishing the fire==
Leaving a fire unattended is dangerous! Any number of accidents might occur in the absence of people, leading to property damage, personal injury or possibly a wildfire. Ash is a very good insulator, so embers left overnight will only lose a fraction of their heat.

Large amounts of water are indispensable for extinguishing a fire. To properly cool a fire, water should be poured on all the embers, including places that are not glowing red. The water will boil violently and carry ash in the air with it, dirtying anything nearby but not posing a safety hazard. The water should be poured until the hissing noises stop. Then the ashes should be stirred with a stick to make sure that the water has penetrated all the layers; if the hissing continues, more water should be added. A fire is fully extinguished if the ashes are cool to the touch.

If water is scarce, sand may be used. The sand will deprive the fire of oxygen quite well, but it is much less effective than water at absorbing heat. Once the fire has been covered thoroughly with sand, all water that can be spared should be poured on it, and the sand stirred into the ash.

Finally, in lightly-used wilderness areas, it is best to replace anything that was moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter anything that was gathered, so that it looks as natural as possible.

==Talk moved from [[How to light a fire]] upon merging==

As well as the three methods of building a fire which the author describes, I would add a fourth, which I would call the funeral pyre method. This is because this is the method used for building funeral pyres. 

The method is to lay layers of equal sized kindling laid horizontally. Each subsequent layer is laid horizontally but at 90 degrees to the previous layer.  Most importantly, the space between the kindling pieces must be at least as much as the width of the kindling in that layer. As the layers build larger kindling is used. This type of fire build collapses in a controlled manner without restricting the air flow.

I propose merging back into [[campfire]]. This article is:
# not specifically about lighting campfires, but also building them, finding places to build them, etc
# not generally about fires, but specifically about campfires

I also think that the advice should be attributed to specific organisations - it will sound more authoritative that way. [[User:MyRedDice|Martin]] 17:39 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:Hm.  I actually started writing this article before I ever looked at [[campfire]] - I don't exactly remember why.  I guess it's a good idea.  The second paragraph of [[campfire]] would be merged into the section on safety, and the final paragraph would become a new section titled ''Campfire activities'' or something to that effect.  I want to get someone else's input before I go through with the merge, though.&lt;br&gt;
:What advice are you talking about exactly? -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 17:45 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Things like &quot;Do not leave a fire burning unattended!&quot;. Now, I'm sure this is good advice, but it sounds like my encyclopedia is telling me what to do! I'd rather have something like:

:Unattended campfires cause 15,365 casualties a year, worldwide. The [[Association of Campers and Caravaners]] gives this advice:

:: &quot;Do not leave a fire burning unattended! Any number of accidents might occur in your absence, blah blah blah, leading to property damage, personal injury or possibly a wildfire. Blah blah blah. Pour water on all the embers, and continue pouring until the hissing noises stop. Blah blah blah.&quot;. [link]

It's not ''bad'' as is... I just think it would be better like that. Up to you, though. [[User:MyRedDice|Martin]] 21:19 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)

:This goes back to the unresolved dispute of [[Wikipedia talk:How-to articles]], but I think you're right.  I won't bother looking up an authoritative quotation, but a partial de-mandatification is in order. -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 04:08 6 Jul 2003 (UTC)

I've begun a full conversion to the declarative mood in preparation for merging this back into [[campfire]]. -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 19:42 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)

We learned how to make a campfire in Girl Scouts. 
First, your tiny candy kindling goes in a pile. Very flammable candy like spicy Jolly Ranchers or Hot Tamales are best, because you want to use something that will burn for a long time. A few mini marshmallow firelighters won't hurt either. 

Next, you make a little pile of all your pretzel sticks around the kindling. The perfectionistic eight-year-old will balance them together the way she imagines a teepee to look. That's the tinder. 

Before you're allowed to eat it, you have to take a tiny pretzel stick, strike it on the table, and carefully reach inside to light it. If you have a really gung-ho troop leader, they may make you light it by rubbing two little pretzels together. Presumably the rock salt is flammable. 

The nice thing about the teepee or cone style of pyro-architecture is that as the kindling inside burns, the pretzels will fall inward toward the jolly ranchers and catch on fire, or burn more, depending.

Some anonymous individual has removed the reference to [[toilet paper]] and [[tampon]]s as excellent tinder.  I'm not responsible for its insertion into the article, but I would like to know exactly what is wrong with it.</text>

==Bread Making==

===French Style Baking===
:The French are renowned for their artisan breads. By using the four basic ingredients of water, flour, [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]], and salt, the French have mastered the art of creating complex breads that vary widely, despite the fact that each loaf contains the same ingredients.  French law dictates that for “French” style breads, only the four above-mentioned ingredients may be used, along with ascorbic acid and [[Cookbook:rye|rye]] flour.  By manipulating rising times, kneading techniques, and with the use of speciality brick ovens, the French breads are as varied and unique as the regions in France.

===Basic Ingredients===
====Flour====
:The most common flour used in baking is wheat-based, which contains proteins that, when agitated in the presence of water, form gluten. Gluten is a stretchy protein structure that holds in the bubbles made by leaveners (such as yeast or baking powder). Flours are graded by the amount of protein — in the United States, high gluten is 12-14%, while the standard bread flour contains 10-13% protein. All-purpose flour has a protein content of 9-12%, and pastry flour, used primarily for baking, is a softer flour with a protein content of about 9-10%.  In Europe, the flour generally contains a lower protein content than that found in American bread flour, which necessitates longer mixing times and additions to the flour, such as ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C, which gives the dough tenacity for better rising).

====Water====
:Many bakers prefer to use filtered water. Tap water that contains any traces of chlorine should not be used because the chlorine can kill the yeast.

====[[cookbook:Yeast|Yeast]]====
:Two basic kinds of yeast are used in bread making: commercial yeast and natural yeast, which is the kind of yeast contained in sourdoughs.  The two most common types of commercial yeast are compressed, also called cake yeast, and dry yeasts of which there are several forms. Active dry yeast must first be “proofed” to activate it prior to adding it to the flour and water: it is soaked in a small amount of water between 90-110F or 32-43C for approximately ten minutes. Sugar can be added to help the yeast “feed” and proof faster.  Instant dry yeast may be mixed into flour before adding water.

:Natural yeast is trickier to work with, and it must be kept in controlled environments. By combining flour and water and allowing it to sit, the mixture will pick up natural yeasts in the air that will ferment to create more yeast. With repeated stirring and additions of flour and water, the mixture will become a sourdough. The sourness of the dough comes from a bacterial culture that lives alongside the natural yeast, typically a lactobacilli strain, most famously &quot;Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot;, as in the famous San Francisco sourdough.

:Professional [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dough_conditioner%20 dough conditioners] are available to enhance the environment for the yeast.

====Salt====
:Salt serves a more important function than just providing flavor; it also controls the fermentation of the yeast. Too much salt and the yeast action will be retarded; too little salt, and the dough will not entrap enough carbonic gases to form a strong texture.  Certain breads, such as Italian ciabattas, do not traditionally contain salt, but the majority of breads do.

&quot;Yeast is soaked in a small amount of water between 90-110 degrees for approximately ten minutes.&quot;
90-110 Celsius degrees would definitely kill the yeast so I will change it to &quot;90-110F or 32-43C&quot;. Someone probably knows a better way of saying this.

== Suggest merge ==

I'd like to suggest that this page be merged with [[Cookbook:Bread]]. [[Cookbook:Bread]] contains similar information, and anything that's missing can be added from this page. I also think that the recipes from this page should be moved to their own pages, and then links to them can be added on the [[Cookbook:Bread_Recipes]] page. What do other people think? [[User:Wikidsoup|Wikidsoup]] ([[User talk:Wikidsoup|talk]]) 00:22, 11 April 2008 (UTC)

:I agree.  I don't think the recipe fits in the context of the discussion of the article. The recipe should, however, be saved somewhere. [[User:Gzuufy|Gzuufy]] ([[User talk:Gzuufy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gzuufy|contribs]]) 02:00, 7 November 2014 (UTC)

I'd suggest moving the biscuit recipe because it does not belong here.  Also, if this page is only going to talk about yeast bread recipes, it should not have a quick bread recipe on it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Beekeeping]] is an inherently local process. What works best for one beekeeper will often fail for another because of even minor differences in climate, forage, or the traits of his sub-race of bees. Also, the needs and goals of the hobbyist [[beekeeper]] will be very different from the needs and goals of the commercial beekeeper. Nevertheless, some generally established '''leading practices for beekeeping''' exist that have wide relevance. 

As with anything in Wikipedia, this information is not guaranteed (See the [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer]]). [[Talk:Beekeeping/Leading practices|This articles' talk page]] is open to civil discussion.

== Explanation of categories ==

The practices on this page are sorted by &quot;Generally Accepted&quot; vs. &quot;Controversial or Emerging&quot; practices and within those categories by the most likely audience - &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Hobbyist&quot; or &quot;Commercial&quot; beekeepers. So far, no leading practices have been identified that are uniquely appropriate to the Sideliner beekeeper.

==Generally accepted==

===All beekeepers===

* '''Treat for disease only as needed''': Over-use or inappropriate use of medications to treat disease or pests will lead to increased resistance to the medication.

* '''Label honey with place of origin''': Honey, like wine, picks up unique flavors from the flowers and nectars in the local environment. Each varietal will have a distinct taste and [[mouthfeel]]. Labeling your honey with place of origin can distinguish it from mass-market blended honeys which have lost that unique flavor and aid in determining its composition if you wish to attempt to recreate it.

* '''Storing pollen''': To store pollen for feeding the next spring, freeze it in sealable plastic bags.

* '''Track Growing Degree Days''': Growing degree days can reliably predict the time from last frost to bloom for each of the major nectar sources in the area of your beehives. This can enable more effective supering and, in some cases, better planning for pest control.

===Hobbyist beekeepers===

* '''Re-queen annually''': There are many benefits to annual re-queening (some of which are still disputed), but the most relevant benefit to the hobbyist beekeeper is that a young queen (&lt;13 months) emits stronger pheromones and therefore hives with young queens rarely swarm. Since hobbyists often keep hives in residential areas with non-beekeeper neighbors, swarm control is a high priority. 

:Some beekeepers believe that it is better to requeen in the Fall, for several reasons:
:*Purchased queens are more available to amateur beekeepers in the Fall; there is a high demand by commercial beekeepers for Spring pollination tasks and queens may thus not be available until relatively late, perhaps after a first year queen has swarmed, taking away a large portion of the colony.
:*If the colony is fed at an appropriate interval before the Spring nectar flow the hive will be strong and ready for production as the young queen will be a better layer of eggs than a queen installed in the previous Spring and far less likely to swarm in the Spring, with appropriate hive management used to reduce the probability of Summer swarming.

* '''Inspect often''': Inspecting your beehive is an important way to learn about bees, bee behavior, etc.  Frequent inspections will expose you to more types of behaviors and help you learn more quickly.  The trade-off in lost honey production is generally worth the educational value. Note that you should be careful in timing inspection to prevent [[Diseases of the honeybee#Chilled brood|chilled brood]].

* '''Elevate the hive''': Placing the hive on a stand about 45 cm (18 inches) high can significantly reduce back strain. It will also deter some predators such as skunks by forcing them to expose less protected underbellies to the bees' stings. Caution: Do not make the stand so high that you will have difficulty removing the full honey supers from the top of the hive.

===Commercial beekeepers===

* '''Standardize your equipment''': Standardized equipment will make it easier to interchange hive parts, frames, etc. between hives as needed.

* '''Inspect only when necessary''': Inspecting beehives disrupts the bees, kills some, and takes time and labor.  It has been estimated that each inspection is the equivalent of reducing the bees' productive time by 3 to 7 days.

==Controversial or emerging practices==

===All beekeepers===

* '''Food Grade Mineral Oil as a miticide''': Recent research by Dr. Pedro Rodriguez and others has suggested that a Food Grade Mineral Oil (FGMO) vapor fogged into the hive can be an effecitive miticide. The vapor droplets are sized to interfere with the mites' respiration without affecting the respiratory apparatus of the larger bees. Research continues in order to improve the consistency of results and improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment.

* '''Do not provide honey as a supplemental feed''': Many beekeepers provide supplemental feed for bees to get through periods of drought or harsh winter. The optimal solution is to leave enough honey on the hive for the colony to survive the winter. When that is not possible, most beekeepers provide sugar water as a supplement for two reasons:

# Honey contains small levels of material that is indigestible to the bees. During a long winter when the bees are confined to the hive and can not leave to void themselves, this can lead to honeybee dysentery. 
# Honey from another hive may be contaminated with American Foulbrood spores. While AFB is harmless to humans and hence may be included with honey, it is an '''''extremely''''' serious disease for honeybees, frequently requiring the whole hive to be torched to prevent the spread of it.

===Hobbyist beekeepers===

* '''Start with two hives''': By starting with two colonies, the beginning beekeeper can compare bee behavior and more rapidly learn what makes a difference and what is random variation. Two hives also increases the odds that at least one hive will survive the winter and lets you split your hive and repopulate when or if one of the colonies dies.

* '''Consider top-bar hives''': The (old) conventional wisdom discourages top-bar hives for beginners, yet the simplicity, low cost, and ease of use are distinct advantantages when learning beekeeping. An advantage of this type of hive is the ease with which it may be completely inspected with minimal disturbance of the bees.

===Commercial beekeepers===
* '''Use first-generation Africanized Queens''': For pollination beekeepers in areas with [[w:africanized bee|africanized bees]] such as [[w:Mexico]] an emerging practice is to locally raise and wild breed queens, but using only a purchased, pre-inseminated non-africanized queen to produce queens. It appears that these first generation africanized queens do not exhibit the extreme and massive defensiveness of subsequent generations.

==Housel positioning==
The text below had been a separate article.  It was merged with [[Beekeeping]] but did not really fit there.  If it fits in Wikipedia, I think it might fit best here.  

However, I'm adding it for discussion on the Talk page before we include it in this article because I have a large portion of skepticism about this particular technique.  I wrote a paper about 2 years ago on Housel positioning.  The existence of the theorized center comb has never been independently confirmed.  Housel reports finding it in feral colonies but other beekeepers looking at other feral colonies find no such pattern.  Furthermore, a 3-D model of such a comb shows that it would either take an inordinately greater amount of wax than the center structure of any other comb or that it would result in a flat-bottomed cell - which would be a sub-optimal use of volume and different than all other comb.  While Housel's theory has been published, it has not been confirmed and is generally considered to be a fringe theory by most bee researchers.  Should this be added to the article and if so, where?  [[User:Rossami|Rossami]] [[User talk:Rossami|(talk)]] 05:14, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Recent research [http://www.beesource.com/pov/lusby/housel.htm] by Michael Housel has resulted in a new trend in comb positioning, called ''Housel positioning''. Housel positioning more closely mimics the arrangement [http://cordovan-honeybee.com/housel/index.htm] of cells created by wild honeybees. Practicioners of Housel positioning have found it to result in larger cells in the outer combs of a Langstroth hive (thus allowing more honey storage), decreased bee stress, and increased utilization of comb foundations in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An agar plate streaked with microorganisms isolated from a deep-water sponge.]]
An '''agar plate''' is a sterile Petri dish that contains agar plus nutrients, and is used to culture bacteria or fungi.  Generally, 'selecting' substances are also added to the plate, such as antibiotics.

==Preparation of agar plates==
Most types of agar are purchased pre-prepared in powder form, although it is possible to buy a base agar mix and add nutrients separately. For a typical standard mix of Lauria-Bertani (LB) agar, the following is added per litre of distilled water whilst on an automatic stirrer:
#10g of an amino acid (usually tryptone or peptone)
#5g of yeast extract
#5g of NaCl
#15g of agarose (omitting this step produces liquid LB)
It can be helpful to gently boil the mixture to facilitate dissolving: this can be done in a microwave oven, or over a gentle flame. Once dissolved the agar needs to be sterilised, usually by pouring it into a conical (Erlenmeyer) flask, then sealing the top with a cotton wool wad, and finally covering the cotton wool with a loose layer of aluminum foil. This is then autoclaved for 15 minutes. The sterile agar is then allowed to cool to 50 &amp;deg;C: this is just above the setting point of agar and pouring at this cooler temperature helps prevent condensation forming on the lid.  Chemical agents (e.g. antibiotics) are added  at this step to prevent their degradation at the higher temperatures; agar is especially useful in that it may be sterilized at higher temperatures yet since it solidifies at lower temperatures, chemical additives may be added without fear of degradation.   
Before the plates are poured, every care is taken not to contaminate them with stray bacteria: '''sterile technique''' must be used. 
#Hands are thoroughly washed with antimicrobial soap and hot water.
#The bench is wiped with ethanol or some other disinfectant
#A Bunsen burner is set up with a gentle blue flame. This will be used to sterilise the mouth of the flask, and will also provides a reasonably sterile environment in the vicinity. This will also be used to flame plates that develop bubbles from pouring.
# The number of plates to be poured are placed on the bench, with their lids still on.
#The aluminium foil is removed and discarded. The cotton wool is removed with the little finger. It is held in the little finger the whole time, '''not''' put down.
#The mouth of the flask is flamed to kill bacteria on the outside of the rim.
#The lid of the plate is lifted just high enough to allow the plate to be poured, and the dish is quickly half filled with agar.
#The lid is replaced, the plate swirled gently to ensure even distribution of the molten agar, then left to stand on the bench for at least 20 minutes to solidify.
#Once all the plates are poured, the flask mouth is reflamed and the cotton wool reinserted. Any unused agar is still sterile.

To allow traceability, a lot number assigned to the flask is written on the plates poured with it.

==Inoculation techniques==
Before inoculation, important information is written on the bottom of the plates, close to the rim:
#date of inoculation
#temperature of incubation
#duration of incubation
#microorganism inoculated

===Streaking===
The most common method of inoculating an agar plate is streaking. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Streak plates.png]]&lt;br&gt;''Streak plates''&lt;/div&gt;

# With this method, a small amount of sample is placed on the side of the agar plate (either with a swab, or as  a drop from an inoculating loop if the sample is a liquid).
# A sterile loop (flamed until red hot, then cooled by touching the agar away from the inoculated sample) is then used to spread the bacteria out in one direction from the initial site of inoculation. This is done by moving the loop from side to side, passing through the initial site.
# The loop is then sterilised (by flaming) again and the first streaks are then spread out themselves.
# This is repeated 2-3 times, moving around the agar plate.

What should happen is that single bacterial cells get isolated by the streaking, and when the plate is incubated, forming discrete colonies that will have started from just one bacterium each.

===Christmas tree===
This pattern is used for culture of [[urine]]. A small loop is dipped in the urine, and a single streak is made down the middle of the agar plate. Then the loop is swayed in and out going through the streak multiple times at [[angle|right-angle]]s to the first streak.

===Stab culture===
A needle is flamed then immersed in the culture. It is then stabbed into a small sterile jar of nutrient agar. If the bacteria are [[anaerobic bacteria|anaerobic]] they will grow, otherwise they do not.

===Preparing a lawn===
A lawn is often used for testing sensitivity to antibiotics, or for work with bacteriophages. What is needed is an even and complete spread of growth all over the agar plate (a &quot;lawn&quot;). Around an antibiotic disc there will be a clear area in which bacterial growth is inhibited; the diameter of this area can be measured to find out whether that bacterial strain is resistant to the antibiotic.

One way to prepare a lawn is to use a 0.5 McFarland suspension of bacteria in saline (this means the saline is made just slightly turbid.) A sterile swab is dipped into this suspension, then it is moved from side to side down the whole agar plate so all the area is covered. The plate is rotated 90 &amp;deg; and the swab moved side to side perpedicularly to the first time. This is done once more with the swab rotated 45 &amp;deg;.

Once a lawn has been prepared, a small disk of sterile filter paper is soaked in antibiotic and placed on the plate. After incubation there will be a ring of zero growth visible around the filter paper if the lawn bacteria are sensitive to that antibiotic. A collection of small disks each soaked in a different antibiotic, and attached to a larger ring, can be purchased commercially. They are known as antibiotic sensitivity discs or by the name &quot;Mastrings&quot; (a trademark of Mast Group Ltd) and can be used to test the sensitivity of an organism to a range of antibiotics all at once.

==Incubation of agar plates==
Plates are incubated upside down to prevent drops of condensation collecting on the inoculated surface.

Some plates are incubated at 37&amp;deg; C in a 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere: the temperature and conditions at which some of the body's bacteria will grow. Special incubators can maintain these conditions.

Some bacteria must be incubated anaerobically (without any oxygen). These can be placed in containers, along with a substance that removes oxygen, and the tightly sealed container placed in the regular incubator.

Fungi, and some bacteria (e.g. ''Yersinia'' sp.), should be incubated slightly cooler. This is usually 30 &amp;deg;C, and room air often is used.

Yoghurt bacteria grow at much higher temperatures (typically ~45 &amp;deg;C). They are therefore particulally safe to use when teaching microbiology, especially to children.

''Campylobacter'' is a difficult bacterial species to grow. It needs special agar plates, plus its own ''microaerophilic'' environment.

==Types of agar plates==
*Blood agar - contains blood cells from an animal (e.g. a sheep). Most bacteria will grow on this medium.
*Chocolate agar - this contains lysed blood cells, and is used for growing fastidious (fussy) respiratory bacteria.
*Neomycin agar - contains the antibiotic neomycin.
*Sabouraud agar - used for fungi. It contains gentamicin and has a low pH that will kill most bacteria.
*Thayer-Martin agar - chocolate agar designed to isolate ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''.
*XLD agar - xylose lysine deoxycholate agar. It is used for the culture of stool samples, and contains two indicators. It is formulated to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria, while the growth of Gram-negative bacilli is encouraged. The colonies of lactose fermenters appear yellow.
*Nutrient agar - safe to use in school science laboratories because it does not selectively grow pathogenic bacteria.
*Hay Infusion agar - used for the culturing of slime moulds.
*MacConkey agar - MacConkey agar is both selective AND differential. The medium is used to differentiate between Gram negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar will inhibit the growth of most Gram positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. The medium also differentiates between lactose-fermenters and lactose nonfermenters. Lactose and neutral red are added to differentiate the lactose fermenters, which form pink colonies, from lactose nonfermenters that form clear colonies.

==Safe disposal of agar plates==
Plates, once finished with, '''must''' be made safe before throwing away. The usual method is to place inside an autoclave bag and then sterilise by autoclaving at 121 &amp;deg;C, 103 kPa (15 psi) for 15 minutes. Plastic plates will melt (hence the bag). After about 20 minutes the autoclave will have cooled down and the bag can safely be thrown away. If no autoclave is available an ordinary domestic pressure cooker can be used, or, in a hospital or professional lab an incinerator may be used.

Other equipment may be decontaminated by being placed in a suitable disinfectant such as Virkon for 24 hours.

When all manipulations are done, the bench is disinfected once again. The last step should be to wash the hands thoroughly with antimicrobial soap and hot water before leaving the lab.

= From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Agar plate]] =
The agar solution doesn't necessarily need to be boiled to dissolve (as a first step); as long as it is thoroughly mixed, the autoclave's heat and boiling of the water during sterilization will cause it to go into solution. [[User:Tygar|Tygar]] 07:13, Feb 12, 2005 (UTC)

== Suggested move to wikibooks ==

I disagree that this article should be moved to wikibooks as per the recently added tag.  It may well be that the article can be improved and made more encyclopaedic and that some of the &quot;how to&quot; might belong elsewhere, but as a frequent user of wikipedia, I was searching for this infomation here and expected to find it on wikipedia--[[User:AYArktos|User:AYArktos]] | [[User_talk:AYArktos| Talk]] 01:42, 20 September 2005 (UTC)


== Question about incubation times ==
How long are the plates usually incubated for?  I assume it depends on the experiment. --[[User:AYArktos|User:AYArktos]] | [[User_talk:AYArktos| Talk]] 01:50, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
:In my ''limited'' experience - a few days. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa Knott]] [[User talk:Theresa knott| (a tenth stroke)]] 02:13, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

::From distant memory, when looking for most human pathogens, plates are incubated for two days in total, although many are looked at after one day, before being reincubated.

::For slower growing pathogens (e.g [[Campylobacter]], [[Bordetella]]), plates are sometimes incubated for longer. But for commoner Staphs, Streps, candida, respiratory bugs, gram negative bacilli, etc., two days is sufficient. Every lab will have their own protocols however.

== From [[Wikipedia:Talk:Abdominal thrusts]] ==
=== Clarifications on when not to use ===

Yes, I know this text is redundant within the article. However, it is previously indicated in italics rather than in the emergency procedures. I feel it's more likely to be noticed if it is mentioned redundantly, and it is critical information. --[[User:Sdfisher|Steven Fisher]] 13:26, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Clarification about ABC(D)s before calling. ==

I feel there is a contradiction in the book. Should one reassess the patient's ABC when he or she becomes unconscious or call EMS right away?
:&lt;s&gt;I can't immediately come up with a situation where this is an issue. I suppose if the victim is conscious, but has a life-threatening injury, you would call EMS before checking their vitals (but after checking ABCs - note the difference between the primary and secondary assessments). Perhaps if you explain what the contradiction is I can answer your query better. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:40, 7 January 2009 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

'''Cheyeeam''' - deep-fried balls of ground chickpeas.

==Ingredients==
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Chickpea|kadalai paruppu]] (Bengal gram, small brown chickpeas)
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Jaggery|vellam]] (jaggery, unrefined palm sugar)
* 10 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|elackai]] (elachi, cardamom pods)
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Maida|maida mavu]] (refined wheat flour)
* 1 litre [[cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for the maida dough

==Procedure==
# Soak kadalai paruppu in clean water for at least 8 hours. They will double in size, so allow extra water for them to soak up!
# For pooranam, boil kadalai paruppu. This should take about 40 minutes in a pot, or about 9 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] (plus 10 minutes to depressurise).
# Grind boiled kadalai paruppu with the jaggery and elachi, without adding any water, making a dough. Make small balls with the dough.
# Make fine dough of maida with a little water, forming a dense consistency. Add salt as needed.
# Soak pooranam balls in the maida dough.
# Pour the oil in a pan. After heating oil, add a few pooranam balls. [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep fry]] individually until golden.

[[Image:Amsterdam, wytwórnia sera.jpg|right|thumb|Making cheese in Amsterdam, Holland]]

'''Home cheesemaking''' has been in practice for thousands of years and comprised nearly all [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]] production until the 19th century. While factory cheese production has taken over the majority of the market, many people still make cheese in the traditional fashion.

== General cheesemaking details ==

[[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] contains a wide variety of fats and proteins. Some of these are suspended solids and minerals; others are liquids. The process of separating the solids from the liquids is curdling; the white solid remainder is known as [[cookbook:curd|curds]], and the greenish liquid remainder [[w:whey|whey]]. Cheese is curds in a wide variety of forms. Soft cheeses are little changed from the original curd; they are typically drained but not pressed, and are usually unaged. Semisoft (or semihard) cheeses are drained and lightly pressed, and may be aged. Hard cheeses are drained and well pressed, and are almost always aged.

To cause milk to curdle requires a curdling agent. There are a wide variety of curdling agents available in nature, both plant and animal based - a quick search of the Internet will show some to you. In practice, only a few are regularly used in cheesemaking. [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]] and [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] are commonly used in soft cheeses, and also assists in making ricotta; it creates a sticky curd in small flecks. [[w:Tartaric acid|Tartaric acid]] is the sharp, lemony curdling agent that makes [[Cookbook:Mascarpone Cheese|mascarpone cheese]], and creates a very fine sticky curd. For most semisoft and hard cheeses, [[w:rennet|rennet]] is used. There are three types of rennet in common usage. The most traditional rennet is an animal rennet; this is an enzyme taken from
the digestive tract of mammals. For [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarians]], more companies are producing a &quot;vegetable&quot; rennet. These are not truly vegetable, but are microbial based. There are two types of vegetable rennet. The more traditional rennet is based on non genetically engineered bacteria. Unfortunately, its curd is often ill-suited for many hard cheeses. Typically used in modern times is one made from genetically engineered bacteria that make the animal-rennet style enzymes. In addition to being vegetarian, It has a higher degree of reliability and consistency than animal rennet, and is widely recommended for use in home cheesemaking.

Aged cheeses change flavor due to the microorganisms that metabolize the sugars and produce by-products (typically bacteria related to [[w:lactic acid|lactic acid]] creation) whose taste people enjoy. Note that having the wrong kind of microorganisms, while unlikely to ever be dangerous, will leave your cheese tasting like vinegar or alcohol, which generally tastes quite bad. Both bacteria and molds are used in cheeses for aging. Bacteria are used in almost every aged cheese. There are two main types: ''thermophilic'' (which are found in [[cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]]) and ''mesophilic'' (which are found in [[cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]]). There are various species that belong to each category, but as an amateur, one probably doesn't need to worry about that. As for molds, there are a wide variety that are used, and each has its own unique properties and flavors. Some of the more widely used ones are ''Penicillium roqueforti'' ([[cookbook:blue cheese|blue cheese]]s) and ''Propionic shermani'' ([[w:Swiss Cheese|swiss cheese]]s). Molds, unlike the bacteria used in cheeses, can often spread from cheese to cheese, and thus should be isolated as much as possible when aging. The longer a cheese is aged, the stronger it tastes; this is why [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] and [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino Romano cheese]] have such strong flavors. Additionally, cheeses with molds, such as blue cheeses, often develop their flavor faster than those without molds.

Color is related to two things: the natural color (which is usually a creamy white to pale yellow), and additives. The most common color additive is [[cookbook:annatto|annatto]], an extract of the dark red seeds of plants in the ''Bixacae'' family, typically grown in South America. Their dark red/orange color dilutes into the typical cheddar-yellow that we're all familiar with. Annatto coloring is generally available in two forms: powder and liquid. The powder can take time to dissolve, and should be added as early in the cheese making process as possible (preferably during pasteurization, as the heat helps it dissolve). The liquid extract is easily mixed in, and can be added at any point before the curdling agent is added.

Traditional [[Cookbook:Food Coloring|food coloring]] does not work well at all for coloring curds; it tends to remain in the whey instead of the curd. However, adding food coloring to uncolored curds after they have been drained but before they have been pressed leads to an attractive mottled pattern rarely found in commercial cheeses.

== Stages and timing ==
[[Image:Production of cheese 2.jpg|right|thumb|Milk separating into curds and whey]]

Timings on most stages of cheese preparation can vary, and are listed in the cheese tables below. Some cheese timings will get you the same effect, however, regardless of which kind of cheese you're making.

The first stage is pasteurization. There are two standard types of pasteurization that can be done: cook the milk at 145°F (63°C) for 30 minutes, or 161°F (72°C) for 15 seconds. In both cases, one must be very careful not to scald and must stir regularly.

The second stage is cooling. For home cheesemaking, this is most easily done in cold water or snow.

The third stage (in all cheeses that age except surface-ripened cheeses) is inoculation. This involves stirring in the cultures (both non-surface molds and bacteria); if yogurt is the source of the bacteria, make sure it is completely dissolved in the milk. The milk should have between 30 and 60 minutes to allow the cultures to spread. Be sure to maintain the desired temperature during this time.

The fourth stage is curdling. A curdling agent is added to the milk and stirred in. For rennet, 30-60 minutes should be allowed with the milk undisturbed; the cheese is ready when you
can pull the thermometer out of the cheese and it retains a hole in the shape of the thermometer without trying to fill the hole back in. Other curdling agents tend to require 5 to 15 minutes.

The fifth stage (for cheeses that require it) is cooking. This typically is only rennet-based cheeses. The curd is cut up with a clean knife into ¼ to ½ inch pieces. Stirring rates, cooking temperatures, and cooking times vary depending on the cheese, and are listed in the table. A longer, hotter cooking makes a stretchier cheese, but cooking too hot risks killing any added cultures.

The sixth stage is draining. More on that is below.

The seventh stage, on many cheeses, is salting. [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] is mixed into the curds. Some cheeses also have other ingredients (such as [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]] or [[cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs]]) mixed in at this point.

The eighth stage (on most semisoft cheeses and all hard cheeses) is pressing. More on that is below. Pressing times vary between cheeses depending on the desired texture. Some cheeses are only &quot;gravity pressed&quot; - allowed to compact under their own weight.

The ninth stage, on brined cheeses, is brining. More information on this can be found in the brining section. Brining times vary. Cheeses that are brined are rarely salted as well.

The tenth stage, on aged cheeses, is aging. Conditions and times vary.

== Draining ==

The curds, when they come out of the pot, contain a large amount of whey. Soft cheeses often contain some or all of the whey, but are usually drained enough to rid of any poorly-retained whey. Semisoft cheeses are gravity drained, and sometimes lightly pressed. Hard cheeses always need to be gravity drained, and then are pressed.

To drain the cheese depends on the type of curd. Cheese made from milk using rennet or lemon juice can typically be drained into regular cheesecloth (note: real cheesecloth should look similar to a net). Recipes for other cheeses often state that one should drain them into a double layer of fine cheesecloth. A much easier solution is to use a single layer of sturdy, clean paper towel. The cheese comes off easier, and the dirty towel can just be tossed.

If your curds don't need the fine cheesecloth, the easiest way to drain them is as follows. Line a colander with cheesecloth. If you want to save the whey (recommended ? see the section on ricotta), place the colander on top of a wire cooling rack over a large bowl. Pour the liquid into the colander. After letting the bulk of the liquid drain out, pick up the cheesecloth by the corners and hang it on anything in your house that you can hang things from, with something beneath to catch the remaining dripping whey. After this, the cheese is generally pressed.

For soft or semisoft cheeses that need fine cheesecloth, you do not press, and instead just wait for it to stop dripping extensively. This may or may not be followed by a
drying process.

== Pressing ==

Hard cheeses need to be pressed to make them live up to their namesake. While commercial cheeses sometimes use centrifuges for draining and even pressing, the easiest way to press cheese at home is to get a cheese press. Simple modern presses tend to be shaped like old-fashioned top hats made of a solid mesh plastic. Inside of it is placed the gravity-drained curds in their cheesecloth. On top of that goes the other part of the press: a cylinder of plastic on which weights are placed. One should start with no more than 5 pounds of weight. After 30 minutes, if desired, one can flip the cheese and increase the weight up to 2½ times as much; after 3 hours, one can flip the cheese again and increase the weight twofold; again, if desired, once can double the weight after 8 hours. The cheese should always be flipped at least once during pressing. Pressing too hard too fast or not flipping enough can make the cheese stick to the cheesecloth when removing it.

One significant obstacle when pressing in a conventional press is balance. Since the still-soft cheese is easily pliable, it is quite easy for the cylinder to tilt, causing the weight to shift and allowing for further tilting. In addition to the possibility of placing external influences to help prevent it from falling over, I found an effective solution: warp the mold itself. If you heat the mold in a large pot of boiling water, it becomes easily warped (and may even warp itself). You should warp it to the extent that the cylinder can still fit into the mold, but has a somewhat hard time of it and takes pressure to do it. This will cause it to help balance itself and even help it hold pressure down on the cheese when some weight is removed. The only downside is that you occasionally need to help the weight by pushing down on the cylinder a bit yourself. As for weight, a large mixing bowl filled with [[cookbook:water|water]] is recommended: one gallon weighs eight pounds.

If you don't have a cheese press and don't want to purchase one, anything with small holes (such as a colander) works. Weight is applied to a flat object (such as a plate) that fits over the top. If the &quot;press&quot; is not cylindrical but instead tapers, the weight bearing object needs to replaced regularly with a smaller one.

Pressing is one of the most important factors in determining the texture of the cheese. Lightly
pressed cheeses are soft and creamy. Firmly pressed cheeses are hard.

== The rind ==

Mold growth on cheese is not a rare occurrence even when cheese is kept for a relatively short period of time. Without a rind, the concept of aging cheeses without mold infection&amp;mdash;some of which age as much as two years before use&amp;mdash;is unrealistic. The number one key to preventing unwanted mold growth is the development of a good rind.

After hard cheeses are pressed, they are dried. Do not rush this process. Your cheese should not be prepared for storage until it has a solid rind on its outside. If you do anything to damage your rind, re-dry it until a new rind is present. Otherwise, you're almost guaranteed to have a problem with mold.

Salt is important in cheesemaking. Some cheeses have the salt mixed in with the curds;
others have the salt coated on the outside, and some cheeses are brined. Salt not only adds flavor, but also acts as a desiccating (drying) agent. Salt on the outside helps with this even more. Brined cheeses often have the best rinds; it also makes them crumbly (has a stronger effect than cooking style).

Brine is salt-saturated water. Some cheeses, after being pressed, are soaked in brine for
one to two days. To make brine, dissolve salt in water as much as you can until the water won't take any more. Use it cold. Water used as a weight in pressing can also be reused for the brine water.

== Ricotta: a special cheese ==

Ricotta is Italian for &quot;recooked&quot;, and its invention was a boon to cheesemakers. Since cheese is the curds of the milk, the whey is normally a waste product - but it still contains a good bit of nutrients. To waste it has never been desirable. However, ricotta (and similar cheeses, such as [[Cookbook:Brunost|Brunost]]) salvages most of the rest of the minerals using heat far greater than you normally would ever apply to milk. Since most of the fat and protein have already been taken out of the whey in forming the curd, there isn't nearly as high of a risk of scalding the milk. Additionally, the heat is high enough to sterilize the whey, so regardless of what
cultures you added during preparation, they will be killed in the preparation of the ricotta. One thing that does not change, however, is color: if your cheese was yellow to begin with, the ricotta will be yellow as well.

To make ricotta, put a pot of whey from any cheese over medium heat for an hour. Then, if it hasn't reached about 200°F (93°C), increase the heat until it reaches this temperature. This helps denature the proteins that suspend the remaining particles in the liquid. Sometimes the heat alone is enough to encourage the separation; often, however, you will need to add a quarter cup of vinegar to the whey from making two gallons of cheese to speed the process (the taste won't be detectable). Cook at this temperature for at least 15 minutes (the longer the better). In the end, you will have the ricotta floating on the top of the remaining whey. Once you let it settle, you will find that the whey looks like slightly murky, slightly greenish water; over 90% of fats and proteins have been removed from it at this point.

Strain the ricotta from the whey through a paper towel-lined colander, and add salt to taste. Once drained and salted, it is ready for use. If you want to make use of the little bit of minerals that still remain in the whey, it can be used as fertilizer.

== General rules for making all cheeses ==

1) Always pasteurize your milk - even if you bought it from the store. Leave your utensils in it while you do this. This will sterilize your pot and utensils, and guarantee that the only things in the milk are going to be what you put there.

2) When pasteurizing milk, '''do not forget to stir'''. If you're forgetful, set a timer. If you forget to stir, the milk will scald; scalded milk should never be used.

3) Do your best to avoid contaminating your sample ? try not to put anything that's not clean (including unclean hands) into your cheese.

4) Make milk-cheeses in batches of at least two gallons to save time (requires a large pot). All listings of ingredients and quantities in here will be per two gallons of milk. Cream-based cheeses have a higher yields, and so making batches using one quart or more of cream is generally acceptable (this guide will assume one quart).

== Additional rules for making hard cheeses ==

1) Always use the freshest, most reliable cultures that you can get. That means that you should use freshly purchased yogurt and buttermilk for your thermophilic and mesophilic cultures (respectively). Try to use online supply sites only for your mold cultures.

2) Try to avoid junket. It works for making cheese but is unreliable, and it's hard to tell how much you'll need. Using real, microbial (?vegetable?) rennet works best for most cheeses. It has the advantage that you don't really need to dilute it first.

3) The rind is critical. Nothing prevents unwanted mold growth better than a good rind. Don't consider your cheese ready to age until it has one (some cheeses only have minimal rinds, but it is better than no rind). This means thorough drying and salting. Even mold-containing cheese should have a good rind to prevent growth of unwanted molds. Salt acts as a desiccating agent and helps inhibit mold growth on its own, and should almost always be added.

4) If unwanted mold does grow on the cheese, the standard remedy found in recipes is to &quot;wipe it off with vinegar&quot;. More generally, one must first wipe the mold off (damaging the rind as little as possible). Then one needs to sterilize it (while vinegar is traditional, hydrogen peroxide is just as effective). Finally, the cheese must be dried with a clean cloth or paper towel and allowed to re-dry and repair any rind damage. Mold thrives on moisture.

5) Don't wrap aging cheese in plastic wrap - that is a good way to encourage mold growth. If you formed a good enough rind, you can wax it. If you find waxing unreliable due to mold, wrap in aluminum foil. Humidity can be controlled by what you wrap in/seal in - in order from most humid to least humid, plastic wrap 100%, a closed plastic container, a loosely closed plastic container, wax, aluminum foil, paper, or nothing. If your cheese is on a perforated rack, a bowl over the cheese can help maintain humidity. Aging cheeses should be regularly inspected for mold.

6) Bacteria can handle almost any conditions; molds like it moist and cool (not cold). The ideal temperatures for aging most cheeses ranges from 45-60°F (7 to 16°C); however, if one wishes to stop the mold from developing further but allow the bacteria to age more (such as to stop hole expansion in Swiss), it needs to be kept in a colder location at ~40°F (4°C).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans can survive 3 days on average without water&amp;mdash;less when it is very hot or one is very active (as opposed to weeks without food).  A single day without water significantly reduces bodily and mental performance.

Water is an essential item on any camping or hiking trip.  Some campgrounds have tap water, drawn from wells and purified.  This water is of reliable quality under normal circumstances and should be used whenever practical.  When tap water is not available, it is usually best to bring all necessary water from home.  However, it is impossible to bring more than a couple of days' worth of water on a backpacking trip, and survival situations may create an unforeseen demand for water.  If this demand is not met, dehydration will result, leading to heat exhaustion, heatstroke and death within days.

Please avoid the thought of rationing water.  The best storage container in a survival situation is your own body.  Even experienced soldiers have been found dead of dehydration with a full canteen.

==Finding Water==
* You should have a map that shows water sources in the area where you plan to operate.
* Water is most likely found where it is carried by natural terrain features such as ravines, gullies and washes.
* Game trails leading down-slope may lead to water, but it may be miles away.
* Water is more  likely found in green areas with a good amount of vegetation.  
* Collect falling rainwater with a tarp, tent, or even clothing.  It is safe.  Funnel or wring it into containers (bottles, canteen, pots, you).
* Quickly running water is more likely to be safe than large slow moving rivers or water in ponds and lakes.
* Dew can be a water source when it condenses on any surface.  Sop it up with a sponge or cloth.
* You can get water by distillation from common leaves, grasses, and other green plants.  Place an armload in a plastic bag/container, then leave it out in an area where it will get a lot of warmth and sunlight.  Make sure that you don't use any poisonous plants, and that the container is sealed, so no water vapor escapes.  Several such containers will be needed for a single person.
* DO NOT drink seawater unless it is distilled!  It takes twice as much water for your body to process seawater as you get from it.
* NEVER drink urine, even if it is filtered.
* Avoid eating snow in cold weather; doing so can significantly lower body temperature (as can becoming dehydrated) and even lead to shock.
* Try to avoid stagnant water.  It is more difficult to make safe.
* Try to avoid brackish water.  Purification or disinfection will not remove salt from brackish water.
* Of the methods discussed above, only distillation and charcoal reduce risks from chemicals dissolved in water.  Try to be aware of the risk of chemically-contaminated water in your area of operation.

==Making Water Safer==
* You should always presume that water found in the outdoors contains disease-causing organisms.  They are present far from any signs of human habitation. These organisms may have no effect on you if you drink the water without treatment OR they make cause debilitating illness or even death (See, for example, giardia, cryptosporidium, cholera, typhoid.).  Therefore, you should do what you can to make the water safer.
* Boiling is the most reliable method to kill all organisms in water.  Bring the water to a rolling boil.  Boil several minutes if at high altitude since water boils at a lower temperature at altitude.  Even bringing water to temperature uncomfortably hot to the touch kills most organisms, but boil if you can.
* Commercial filters in working condition and used correctly remove all organisms except viruses.
* Chlorine dioxide (NOT &quot;bleach&quot; which is chlorine hydroxide) used according to directions will kill all organisms in water.  Wait times may be four hours.
* Water in a closed, clear container (Think 2 ltr. softdrink bottle.) if exposed to a day of strong sunlight is usually safe (See SODIS).
* Water obtained by distillation (See above.) is usually safe.
* A well dug ten feet/3 meters or more from a body of water and dug to a depth below the water level in that body of water, will gradually fill with water that is safer than the source body of water.
* A filter of layers of grass, sand, and charcoal (from a fire site) inside a cone or cylinder of bark, plastic, aluminum foil or the like, will make water safer.
* A filter of 6-8 layers of tightly-woven cloth will make water safer.
* Allowing particles in water to settle to the bottom of a container and then treating the clearer water towards the top improves the resutls of treatment.  Such &quot;settling&quot; of water, alone, makes water safer.
* Any method that makes water safer, such as use of &quot;bleach&quot; (Chlorine hydroxide) or iodine, is better than not treating the water at all.  Putting it another way, killing or otherwise eliminating some of the wee nasties is better than leaving them all for your body to fight.

AND
* Bring &quot;enough&quot; safe water with you where ever you go OR have a method to render safe water from known sources.  Be prepared.
* If you have no water, avoid eating fats and proteins because your body uses water to process them.  Juicy vegetable foods may sources of water.  
* Always try to keep the sun off of you, regardless of how much clothing or sunblock you are wearing.  It heats your body up over time, so you lose a LOT more water from your body from the extra sweating.
* When melting snow in the winter, first melt a small amount in the bottom of a pot and then add more snow slowly. If you fill a pot with snow and put it over a fire, the snow at the bottom may sublimate directly into a gas, leaving the bottom of the pot dry and vulnerable to melting. 
* Pouring boiled water back and forth between pots after boiling will remove the flat taste.  If you are very thirsty, you will not notice a flat taste.
* If in the desert, do not remove your clothing as your sweat will evaporate more quickly and you will dehydrate faster. Ideally you want light colored, lightweight, loose clothing that covers as much skin as possible.
* Do your work in the early mornings and at dusk to avoid the hottest part of the day.  Get extra sleep during that time.
* Your stomach is the best water container. People have been found dead of dehydration with water still in their canteens. Don't drink more than you need to, but don't be stingy with it either.
* Always try to protect yourself as much as possible from the wind, it can dehydrate you in mere hours of exposure in areas with little cover, particularly mountains and plains.

==If a natural water source is available==
It is not difficult to obtain water from a natural body of fresh water such as a river or lake, but this water should not be used untreated.  Natural water often contains organisms that cause infectious disease, most notably ''[[w:Giardia lamblia|Giardia lamblia]]''.  There are four ways to remove this threat and make natural water potable.

* Water may be boiled over a campfire or portable stove.  At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, so the boil must be maintained for several minutes to kill the microorganisms.
* Water may be filtered with a portable water purification device.  Water purifiers differ widely, so if you own one, familiarize yourself with the instruction manual.  If the water is visibly dirty, pour it through a clean cloth to remove large particles and avoid prematurely clogging the purifier.
* Certain chemicals, such as dilute chlorine solution, are commercially sold as antimicrobial additives.  Some leave an unpleasant flavor that may be masked with powdered drink mix.
* Water may be added to an evaporation still or solar still to purify the water through the natural evaporative process.  Questionable water is added then when it evaporates it rises and condenses on a cooler surface.  It then drips into your collection container where it can be collected using tubing to maintain the efficiency of your still.  The warmer the still becomes the faster you will be able to collect pure water.  Only a few chemicals will evaporate with the water one of which is benzene.  This is usually only a concern when trying to purify flood waters.
This method can also be used to purify salt water.  As long as the salt water is not allowed to get on your collection surface or in your collection container the water will be potable.

==If a natural water source is not available==
===The evaporation still===
[[image:Evapo_still.png|frame|none|right|Cross-section diagram of an evaporation still]]
Water may also be obtained from the soil or from plant matter.

Probably the best way to get water from the ground is the evaporation still, shown in cross-section in the diagram at right.  To build an evaporation still, you need only four items: a shovel, a sturdy sheet of transparent plastic, a cup, and a piece of flexible plastic tubing long enough to reach from the middle of the plastic sheet to the side with some excess length.

Begin by digging a hole with sloping sides in the shape of the sheet of plastic, but slightly smaller.  Avoid digging in hot weather, as you will lose considerable amounts of water through sweat.  Sink the cup in the middle of the hole so that the rim is almost flush with the sides of the hole.  Place one end of the tube in the cup, run the other end to the outside of the hole, and place the sheet of plastic over the whole assembly.  Weigh down the sides of the plastic sheet, or anchor them with stakes, and place a small weight directly over the cup.

The evaporation still will produce water continuously.  The plastic sheet will create a greenhouse effect in the still, accelerating the natural evaporation of water from the soil.  When the water vapor hits the plastic sheet, it will condense and drip down into the cup.  The tubing may be used to drink from the cup without disturbing the still.  For added effectiveness, use a second cup to pour any available water-based fluids, such as urine or water collected from roofing or tent surfaces into the pit.  A second tube would also work for this same purpose.

===The vegetation still===
An easier method uses just a plastic bag.  Gather enough succulent vegetation (big leaves, cacti stripped of their thorns, etc.) to mostly fill the bag.  Mash it to break through the leaves' outer water-resistant cuticle.  As in the evaporation still, a greenhouse effect will cause water to evaporate from the leaves.  It will then condense on the plastic and run down into the bottom of the bag.

The water in the bag will pick up chemicals from the leaves.  These will give it a strong leafy flavor, and may include toxins, so make sure not to gather any poisonous plants.

Vegetation may also be added to an evaporative still to avoid the unpleasant taste but the used vegetation will have to be cleared out after the water has been collected from it.  Preferably at night when the still is less effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Crassostrea gigas'', the Japanese oyster, is ideally suited for cultivation in sea water ponds or in the water from seawater ponds.  Major advantages of this oyster are:
#Gigas does well in water with high concentrations of phytoplankton, the normal situation in marine ponds which are growing fish or prawns and which therefore have high nutrient loadings.
#Spat (the juveniles) of gigas are readily available from hatcheries all over the world and are also not too difficult to reproduce in a modest mariculture hatchery.
#Gigas has a ready market and is a fast grower.  In phytoplankton rich water it becomes very fat (lots of glycogen stored) and as a result is very tasty.
#Gigas can survive a wide range of temperatures from near freezing up to 30 degrees although it grows fastest and fattest at around 20 degrees.

== Experimental Cultivation of gigas ==
A simple way to test if the oysters will thrive is to construct some simple baskets of stiff plastic mesh (netlon for instance). Put in a few tens of small, young gigas and suspend the baskets from the monks (water outlet structures) of the pond.  Use mesh of at least 10mm opening so that it doesn't plug up too quickly with marine fouling organisms.  A simple way of doing this is to cut two disks of, say, 30cm diameter one for the top and one for the bottom and a strip of, say 10cm wide for the side.  Sew up with plastic cord and leave a place where the baskets can be opened to add and remove oysters as necessary.  Attach three cords equally spaced around the upper rim, tie them together  and attach a cord long enough to suspend baskets in the pond.  Gigas grown this way in Elat reached a total weight of 75 grams in 9 months and had very high quality indices.

Crassostrea produce large amounts of faeces and pseudofaeces when they are in plankton rich water so every few days they will need to be agitated to remove this material.  Otherwise they will smother.  Further along in this module we describe a way of growing the oysters so that they are pretty well immune from this build up of sediment.

=== Oyster Morphology ===
If you cup your left hand and cover the cup with your right hand which you keep flat, this represents the shells of an oyster.  The hinge is at the part of your hand nearest to the wrist and the opening at the ends of your fingers.  Imagine your body shrinking until it will fit inside your hands in the same orientation as you are sitting now.  The cupped left hand is the left shell of the oyster but since this is the shell that is attached to the substrate (often intertidal rocks in the case of Saccostrea sp.) it is commonly referred to as the lower shell while the flat right shell is commonly called the upper shell.  A membrane or skin attaches along the oysters back and lines the shells.  This membrane is called the mantle.  

=== Oyster Feeding ===
Oysters feed by means of their gills.  They close the gap between the shells with their mantle, leaving an openings where your thumb and little finger are in the above paragraph.  Cillia on the gills beat, creating a flow of water in one opening and out the other.  The mucus on the gills captures particles and the action of cillia move the mucus with its edible particles along pathways on the gills towards the mouth.  Inedible particles are sent along other pathways away from the mouth.  From time to time, the oyster closes quickly, blowing out the unwanted particles which are stuck together with mucus.  This expelled material is referred to as pseudofaeces.  As it is now in larger particles than when it was individual cells of phytoplankton, it sinks faster and forms an organic layer along with ordinary faeces on the bottom of its growing vessel (pond, trough, tank etc.)In waters with high concentrations of plankton, even particles which are edible by the oysters are expelled as pseudofaeces.   This potential food is therefore lost to the oysters.  Below a method to make better use of more of the available food is described.

=== More Efficient Use of Phytoplankton ===
Oysters produce pseudofaeces when exposed to edible particles in high concentrations.  This, of course, wastes food that could have been used to grow more oysters.  It also produces  more grunge which rapidly turns anaerobic and must be cleared more often from the growing vessel.  Since marine fish and prawns are fed with large quantities of prepared feed, in sunny areas, where much of this type of cultivation occurs, very rich blooms of phytoplankton develop in the ponds.  Any system which presents this food at the correct concentration to the oysters will increase the quantity of oysters that can be grown from a given area of sea water pond.  A way which has been used successfully is to build a trough (1m x 1m for instance) which is a little lower than the pond.  The water leaving the pond is run through the trough.  Instead of letting all the water in one end and out the other, the water is introduced all along the trough.  This keeps renewing the phytoplankton as the oysters remove it and ensures that all the oysters are growing in an algae soup which is more dilute in phytoplankton than the water in the pond.

== Cleaning the Trough ==
Oysters produce very large amounts of faeces and if in rich water, large amounts of pseudofaeces.  After a time this material builds up on the bottom of the trough, becomes anaerobic and begins to produce hydrogen sulphide an ammonia.  It is wise to fit the oyster trough with monk boards or some similar system so that the water can be let down completely and the trough flushed out. At the same time the oysters can be washed off although this becomes much less critical with the following growing method.

== Self Cleaning Oysters ==
While a common method of growing oysters it to put them on mesh trays with their lower shells down, in this orientation, the oysters can easily be smothered by the solid wastes of oysters above them.  The trick is to suspend them hinge up, opening down.  A method which worked well in a pilot study in Elat was to glue spat on to netlon mesh on trays and place them in the ponds or troughs.  As an oyster grows it attaches by its lower shell to the substrate.  After a few weeks, the trays were removed from the water and the mesh cut up to leave an eye of mesh distal to the hinge on each oyster.  The oysters were then suspended from the corners of vinyl coated wire weld mesh with a hole size of 55mm.  This was fairly labour intensive but when compared with the work that goes into cleaning oysters on trays or the work done to grow oysters in the intertidal zone in many parts of the world then it can be seen that even this experimental method was not that onerous.  Once the oysters are suspended this way, they are only handled once again for harvest.

== Shell Worm ==
In many parts of the world there are worms that settle on the lip of oysters and then grow inbetween the layers of the shell.  When an oyster is opened, the cavity thus produced is often broken into and spills its contents of anaerobic mud on to the oyster.  These worms are particularly prevalent in muddy conditions.  One way of reducing such attacks is to clean the oysters often.  However, a less laborious way is to ensure that these animals do not enter the pond.  Since they enter as microscopic larvae, this necessitates the microfiltration of the water entering the ponds.  With the high exchange rates typically used in marine ponds, this is impossible or at least very expensive by man made mechanical methods.  

A better way is to take the water from the beach or sea bottom.  A number of methods have been used, depending on the individual location.  In desert areas or areas where, due to the particular geology of the site, there is no fresh water flowing underground out into the sea, a well can often be dug above the high tide mark and a pump lowered into the well.  If you are lucky enough to have such a site, this is probably the least expensive system to build and to run.  The entire beach adjacent to the site becomes the filter for the well.  Since the area is very large, the flow rate becomes very slow and the filter will often act as a live filter rather than as a mechanical filter.

As water is sucked through the beach or seabottom, oxygen goes with it.  This allows many organisms to settle in the spaces between the particles.  Many of these filter particulate material from the water.  A good indication that the filter is actively filtering is a level of Oxygen in the water entering the pond which is lower than the oxygen level in the nearby ocean.

==Oyster Quality==
There are a number of measurements of &quot;oyster quality&quot;.  One of the most accepted indices is to divide the dry weight of the oyster meat in grams by the volume of the space where the oyster lives in cubic centimetres.  The dry weight of the oyster meat is obtained by drying to constant weight  the meat of the shucked oyster at just over 100 degrees.  The volume of the cavity is found as follows.  The unshucked, closed oyster is suspended by a thread from the hook under a top loading balance.  The weight is noted.  A container of water is brought up under the oyster and raised until the whole oyster is immersed.  The change in weight in grams is equal to the volume of the oyster in cubic centimetres.  After the oyster is shucked, the same procedure is followed with the empty shell.  The difference in the two measurements is the volume of the cavity of the oyster.

Interesting that the Dutch article [[:nl:Japanse oester]] refers to a different genus (''Crassostrea gigas'').  [[User:A-giau|A-giau]] 04:16, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

In the [[Java programming language]], a '''package''' is a group of related [[Class (computer science)|classes]] and [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]].  Packages in Java have a close correspondence to packages in the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]; they are less closely related to [[Namespace (programming)|namespaces]] in [[C plus plus|C++]].

Although it is conventional to name Java packages hierarchically, this hierarchy has no semantics in the language.  For example, packages that begin with &quot;java&quot; are part of the ''Java language specification'', and the package &lt;code&gt;[[java.lang]]&lt;/code&gt; and other packages that begin with &quot;java.lang&quot; contain classes that are core to the language.  However, it is ''not'' possible to import all of the Java classes (for example, classes in &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[java.util]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[java.io]]&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) with the statement
 import java.*;
and the statement
 import java.lang.*;
will import all of the classes in the package &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt;, but ''not'' the packages &lt;code&gt;[[java.lang.ref]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[java.lang.reflect]]&lt;/code&gt;.  This is in contrast to the hierarchical namespaces of C++.

Like class names, package names in Java specify the location of class files.  Classes in the package &lt;code&gt;org.xml.sax&lt;/code&gt; must be located in a directory &lt;code&gt;org/xml/sax/&lt;/code&gt;.  This rule has been criticized (primarily by the designers of [[C Sharp Programming|C#]]) as unduly restrictive on the programmer.  However, this restriction does simplify the design of the [[Dynamic linking|class loader]].

Java packages that begin with &quot;java&quot; are part of the ''Java language specification''.  Packages that begin with &quot;javax&quot; are extensions to the specification, sometimes refining or replacing functionality in &quot;java&quot; packages.  The java.*, javax.* and org.* packages make up the Java platform's official API - all implementions of J2SE that are &quot;100% pure Java&quot; should support these packages out of the box.  Other packages are external to the platform.

Java packages other than those in the language specification follow a [[naming convention]] that ensures there are no naming conflicts.  A package name should start with the [[domain name]] reversed, for example &quot;com.sun&quot; for packages from [http://www.sun.com www.sun.com].  Within a given company or educational institution, the rest of the package name follows a standard set by that company or institution, but a common organization is to have the next part of the package name indicate the department (so, for example &quot;edu.mit.cs&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Potometer.png|right|A  device for measuring rate of transpiration]]

A potometer is a device used for measuring the rate of water uptake of a leafy plant shoot. The main reason for water uptake by a cut shoot is transpiration (evaporation in plants) and is effected by the transpiration stream.

By changing the surrounding atmospheric conditions, the effect on transpiration of wind, heat, and humidity can be measured. Potometers are notoriously difficult to set up, because air bubbles in the xylem of the plant or in the apparatus itself will prevent the device from working properly.

==The basic design of a potometer==

It consists of:
*'''A length of capillary tube''' A bubble is introduced to the capillary. As water is taken up by the plant, the bubble moves. The distance the bubble travels in a given time is determined by the rate of transpiration by the plant.
*''' A reservoir'''. By turning the tap on the reservoir, the position of the bubble can be set at the start of the experiment. Some designs of potometer use a syringe instead of a funnel with a tap.
* '''A tube for holding the shoot'''. In the diagram the shoot is held in place by inserting a rubber bung in the tube. The hole in the bung through which the shoot passes must be thoroughly greased with petroleum jelly to keep it airtight.

==Setting up==
#Cut a ''leafy'' shoot from  a plant (e.g. Pelargonium) and plunge its base into water (try not to get any water on the leaves). This prevents the xylem from taking up any air.
#Back in the laboratory, put the stem into a large sink full of water and carefully trim the shoot again, by cutting off the bottom '''under water''' with a sharp razor blade. Keep the leaves out of the water.
#Immerse the whole of the potometer into the sink. Move it about until all the air bubbles come out.
#Put the shoot stem into the bung, grease the joint with plenty of petroleum jelly, then put the bung into the potometer.
#Make sure the tap is closed, then lift the whole ensemble out of the water.
#Leave the end of the capillary tube out of the water until an air bubble forms then put the end into a beaker of water.

==Using a potometer==
Allow the bubble time to round the corner and start at the beginning of the mm scale. Then time how far the bubble moves in a given period of time. Repeat under different conditions and compare. The usual conditions to try are placing the plant in a bright light, placing it by a fan, and placing it in a humid atmosphere. If the surface area (both sides)of the leaves are measured then it is possible to compare the transpiration rates of different species of plant. A useful comparison unit could be 
'''Water loss(ml)/ cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/minute

'''Limitations of a potometer'''
# Introducing the air bubble is not easy.
# The twig may not fully remain alive for a long time.
# Any changes in the outside air temperature may affect the position of the air bubble in the capillary tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Type conversion ==
In [[computer science]], '''type conversion''' or '''typecasting''' refers to changing an entity of one [[w:datatype|datatype]] into another. There are two types of conversion: implicit and explicit. The term for implicit type conversion is '''[[#Implicit type conversion|coercion]]'''. Explicit type conversion in some specific way is known as '''[[#Explicit type conversion|casting]]'''. Explicit type conversion can also be achieved with separately defined conversion routines such as an overloaded object constructor.

== Implicit type conversion ==
Implicit type conversion, also known as '''coercion''', is an automatic type conversion by the [[w:compiler|compiler]]. Some [[programming language|language]]s allow, or even require compilers to provide coercion.

In a mixed type expression, a subtype ''s'' will be converted to a [[w:supertype|supertype]] ''t'' or some subtypes ''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ... will be converted to a supertype ''t'' (maybe none of the ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is of type ''t'') at [[w:runtime|runtime]] so that the program will run correctly. For example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
double  d;
long    l;
int     i;
if (d &gt; i)      d = i;
if (i &gt; l)      l = i;
if (d == l)     d *= 2;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is legal in a [[C programming language|C language]] program. Although ''d'', ''l'' and ''i'' belong to different datatypes, they will be automatically converted to the same datatype each time a comparison or assignment is executed.

== Explicit type conversion ==
There are several kinds of explicit conversion.

; checked : before the conversion is performed a runtime check is done to see if the destination type can actually hold the source value. If not an error condition is raised.
; unchecked : no check is performed and when the destination type can not hold the source value the result is undefined.
; bit pattern : The data is not interpreted at all and just the raw bit pattern is copied.

Each [[programming language]] has its own rules on how types can be converted. In general, both objects and fundamental data types can be ''converted''.

=== in C/C++ ===

A '''cast''', or ''explicit type conversion'', is special programming instruction which specifies what [[w:data type|data type]] to treat a variable]] as (or an intermediate calculation result) in a given expression.

Casting will ignore &quot;extra&quot; information (but never adds information to the type being casted). The C/C++ '''cast''' is either &quot;unchecked&quot; or &quot;bit pattern&quot;. 

As an example with fundamental data types, a fixed-point float could be cast as an [[w:integer|integer]], where the data beyond the decimal (or binary) point is ignored. Alternatively, an integer could be cast as a float if, for example, a function call required a floating point type (but, as noted, no information is really added - 1 would become 1.0000000).

Object casting works in a similar way. A [[w:subclass|subclass]] can be cast as a parent type, where the &quot;extra&quot; information that makes it a subclass is ignored, and only the parts inherited from the parent are treated. For example, a triangle class derived from a shape class could be cast as a shape.

=== Two common casting styles ===

There are two common casting styles, each outlined below.

==== C-style casting ====

This style of casting is used in [[C programming language|C]] and Java. It follows the form:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(type)expression
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== C++-style casting ====

Several cast syntaxes are used in [[C plus plus|C++]] (although C-style casting is supported as well). The function-call style follows the form:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;type(expression)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This style of casting was adopted to force clarity when using casting. For example, the result of, and intention of, the C style cast
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;(type)firstVariable + secondVariable&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
may not be clear, while the same cast using C++-style casting allows more clarity:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;type(firstVariable + secondVariable)&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
or
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;type(firstVariable) + secondVariable&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Later in the evolution of C++, the following more explicit casts were added to the language to clarify the programmer's intent even further:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
static_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
dynamic_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
const_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
reinterpret_cast&lt;type&gt;(value_to_cast)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Static casts converts type-compatible values. For instance the following:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
double myDouble = 3.0;
int myInt = static_cast&lt;int&gt;(myDouble);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

converts the double-precision [[w:floating point|floating point]] value &lt;code&gt;myDouble&lt;/code&gt; (3.0) to the corresponding integer value (3). Static casts can be dangerous:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
YourClass * pYour = GimmeAnObject();
void * pv = pYour;                                // no cast needed.
MyClass * p = static_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(pYour);      // MyClass had better be related to YourClass...
p-&gt;SomeMethod();                                  // ...or this might blow up in a nasty way.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Static casts on pointers or references do not verify that the pointed-to object is type-compatible to the new type. 

A dynamic cast is safer than a static cast in this scenario: it is compiled by the compiler into a call to the C++ runtime library where a check is made to ensure legal casts. This is analogous to the casts in Java.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
YourClass * pYour = GimmeAnObject();
void * pv = pYour;                                // no cast needed.
MyClass * p = dynamic_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(pYour);     // This will not blow up in the same way
if (p != 0)
    p-&gt;SomeMethod();                              // C++ guarantees p points to a MyClass
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Dynamic casts on pointers return a null pointer if cast value is type incompatible. Dynamic casts on a reference throw a type exception.

A const cast casts away the constness of an object, returning a non-const reference to the same object. This allows modifications to objects that normally would be treated read-only by the compiler:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const MyClass * cantTouchThis = CreateConstObject();
cantTouchThis-&gt;constant_value = 41;                        // compile-time error.
const_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(cantTouchThis)-&gt;constant_value = 42; // compiles, but who knows what happens at runtime?
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The reinterpret cast is the most notorious one in C++. It allows the reinterpretation of the raw bit pattern of the value to be cast, disregarding the type system completely. For example, it allows the casting of an arbitrary integer to a pointer to an object:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
MyClass * pclass = reinterpret_cast&lt;MyClass *&gt;(0xDEADBEEF); // I know what I am doing
pclass-&gt;some_field = 3.14159;                               // very unsafe indeed
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Opinions were divided when these verbose casts were introduced into the language. Detractor]]s argued the new syntax was 'ugly', while [[w:supporter|supporter]]s claimed that since casting is such an 'ugly' activity to begin with, it should be highlighted with an 'ugly' syntax to alert [[w:programmer|programmer]]s. Another perceived advantage is the ease with which verbose casts can be located in [[w:source code|source code]] using [[w:programming tools|programming tools]] like [[w:grep|grep]].

= Off topic =

This article is off topic. Most of it is not &quot;Type conversion&quot; but &quot;tutorial to C/C++ cast operation&quot;.

I did some to improve (see history) but I would ask the C/C++ advocates to consider two things:

# tutorials belong to wikibooks.
# that there are other programming languages where &quot;Type conversion&quot; has a more broader meaning.

and maybe improve the C/C++ chapter.

:You are right in that the current article is not good at all. But we need to remember that C++ has quite complex type conversion system, compared with others. The problem is the shortcoming, which is not intentionally done by C/C++ advocates but is mere result of lack of contributions so far. If you think the article goes too deep, take a look at [[LR parser]] and the like. 

-- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] 04:27, Nov 30, 2004 (UTC)

: Did you read my Ada article? C++ is not the only language with a complex type conversion system. And of corse is should be described in wiki. The question I was trying to raise was &quot;wikipedia vs wikibooks&quot;. How much of C/C++ cast need to be described in wikipedia &quot;The Free Encyclopedia&quot; and what should better moved to wikibooks &quot;Think Free. Learn Free&quot;.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 09:43, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: I support the idea of a merger between &quot;typecasting&quot; and &quot;type conversion&quot;. I was searching for dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;. The first link I took brought me to &quot;typecasting&quot;. However, I found the explanation on &quot;type conversion&quot;.
--[[User:Kriti Sen Sharma|Kriti]] 05:24, 24 Aug 2005(UTC)

--[[User:Mrja84|Mrja84]] 20:14, 11 Oct 2005(ESDT)

:: Of course, this depends on the language and primitives you want to use. But since you're asking, the answer could be &lt;code&gt;*string - '0'&lt;/code&gt;. --[[User:TuukkaH|TuukkaH]] 14:45, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Concept ==

We can see from our initial overviews that FM and PM modulation schemes have a lot in common. Both of them are altering the angle of the carrier sinusoid according to some function. It turns out that we can go so far as to generalize the two together into a single modulation scheme known as '''angle modulation'''. Note that we will never abbreviate &quot;angle modulation&quot; with the letters &quot;AM&quot;, because Amplitude modulation is completely different from angle modulation.

== Instantaneous Phase ==

Let us now look at some things that FM and PM have of common:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{FM} = A\cos (2 \pi [f_c + ks(t)]t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_{PM} = A\cos (2 \pi f_c t + \alpha s(t))&lt;/math&gt;

What we want to analyze is the ''argument of the sinusoid'', and we will call it Psi. Let us show the Psi for the bare carrier, the FM case, and the PM case:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{carrier}(t) = 2 \pi f_c t + \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{FM}(t) = 2 \pi[f_c + ks(t)] t + \phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{PM}(t) = 2 \pi f_c t + \alpha s(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = A\cos(\Psi(t))&lt;/math&gt;

This Psi value is called the ''Instantaneous phase'' of the sinusoid.

== Instantaneous Frequency ==

Using the Instantaneous phase value, we can find the ''Instantaneous frequency'' of the wave with the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also express the instantaneous phase in terms of the instantaneous frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t f(\lambda)d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Where the Greek letter &quot;lambda&quot; is simply a dummy variable used for integration. Using these relationships, we can begin to study FM and PM signals further.

== Determining FM or PM ==

If we are given the equation for the instantaneous phase of a particular angle modulated transmission, is it possible to determine if the transmission is using FM or PM? it turns out that it is possible to determine which is which, by following 2 simple rules:

#In PM, instantaneous phase is a linear function.
#In FM, instantaneous frequency minus carrier frequency is a linear function.

For a refresher course on Linearity, there is a chapter on the subject in the [[Signals and Systems/Time Domain Analysis/LTI systems|Signals and Systems book]] worth re-reading.

{{Info|FM radio uses generalized &quot;Angle Modulation&quot;}}

== Bandwidth ==

In a PM system, we know that the value &lt;math&gt;\alpha s(t)&lt;/math&gt; can never go outside the bounds of &lt;math&gt;(-\pi, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Since sinusoidal functions oscillate between [-1, 1], we can use them as a general PM generating function. Now, we can combine FM and PM signals into a general equation, called ''angle modulation'':&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A \sin ( 2 \pi f_c t + \beta \sin (2 \pi f_m t))&lt;/math&gt;

If we want to analyze the spectral components of this equation, we will need to take the Fourier transform of this. But, we can't integrate a sinusoid of a sinusoid, much less find the transform of it. So, what do we do?

It turns out (and the derivation will be omitted here, for now) that we can express this equation as an infinite sum, as such:&lt;br /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}J_n(\beta) \sin [2 \pi(nf_m + f_c)t] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

But, what is the term &lt;math&gt;J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;? J is the ''Bessel function'', which is a function that exists only as an open integral (it is impossible to write it in closed form). Fortunately for us, there are extensive tables tabulating Bessle function values.

== The Bessel Function ==

The definition of the Bessel function is the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;J_n(\beta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{j[\beta sin\theta - n\theta]} d\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The bessel function is a function of 2 variables, N and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

Bessel Functions have the following properties:

*If n is even: &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{-n}(\beta) = J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
*If n is odd: &lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J_{-n}(\beta) = -J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;J_{n-1} + J_{n+1} = \frac{2n}{\beta}J_n(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;.

The bessel function is a relatively advanced mathematical tool, and we will not analyze it further in this book.

== Carson's Rule ==

If we have our generalized function:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = A\sin ( 2 \pi f_c t + \beta \sin (2 \pi f_m t))&lt;/math&gt;

We can find the bandwidth BW of the signal using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;BW=2(\beta + 1)f_m = 2(\Delta f + f_m)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum frequency deviation, of the transmitted signal, from the carrier frequency. It is important to note that Carson's rule is only an approximation (albeit one that is used in industry frequently).

== Demodulation: First Step ==

Now, it is important to note that FM and PM signals both do the same first 2 steps during demodulation:

#Pass the signal through a '''limiter''', to remove amplitude peaks
#Pass the signal through a bandpass filter to remove low and high frequency noise (as much as possible, without filtering out the signal).

Once we perform these two steps, we no longer have white noise, because we've passed the noise through a filter. Now, we say the noise is '''colored'''. 

here is a basic diagram of our demodulator, so far:

       channel
 s(t) ---------&gt; r(t) ---&gt;|Limiter|---&gt;|Bandpass Filter|----&gt;z(t)

Where z(t) is the output of the bandpass filter. 

== Filtered Noise ==

To denote the new, filtered noise, and new filtered signal, we have the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;z(t) = \gamma A \cos (\Psi(t)) + n_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where we call the additive noise &lt;math&gt;n_0(t)&lt;/math&gt; because it has been filtered, and is not white noise anymore. &lt;math&gt;n_0(t)&lt;/math&gt; is known as '''narrow band noise''', and can be denoted as such:

:&lt;math&gt;n_0(t) = \mathbf{W}(t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t) + \mathbf{Z}(t) \sin(2 \pi f_c t)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, once we have it in this form, we can use a trigonometric identity to make this equation more simple:

:&lt;math&gt;n_0(t) = \mathbf{R}(t) \cos(2 \pi f_c t + \mathbf{\Theta}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}(t) = \sqrt{\mathbf{W}(t)^2 + \mathbf{Z}(t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Theta}(t) = tan^{-1} (\mathbf{Z}(t)/\mathbf{W(t)})&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the new noise parameter R(t) is a '''rayleigh''' random variable, and is discussed in the next chapter.

== Noise Analysis ==

R(t) is a noise function that affects the amplitude of our received signal. However, our receiver passes the signal through a limiter, which will remove amplitude fluctuations from our signal. For this reason, R(t) doesnt affect our signal, and can be safely ignored for now. This means that the only random variable that is affecting our signal is the variable &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Theta}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;Theta&quot;. Theta is a uniform random variable, with values between pi and -pi. Values outside this range &quot;Wrap around&quot; because phase is circular.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Input functions accept data from the calculator's user.  Input and output functions can be found under '''PRGM:I/O'''.

== Input ==

&lt;tt&gt;Input&lt;/tt&gt;, '''PRGM:I/O:1''', accepts both keyboard and graph point data.  Its general form is &lt;tt&gt;:Input [Str&lt;i&gt;#&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;tt&gt;Input&lt;/tt&gt; without a variable will open the current graph and pause the program.  The arrow keys can be used to move the cursor.  When '''ENTER''' is pressed, the variables &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Y&lt;/tt&gt; will be updated with the (X,Y) position of the cursor.  In '''PolarGC''' mode, R and &amp;theta will be updated instead.

If a variable follows &lt;tt&gt;Input&lt;/tt&gt;, the program will accept a value from the keyboard and store it in the variable when '''ENTER''' is pressed.

If the format &lt;tt&gt;:Input &quot;string&quot;,&lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is used, the calculator will display up to 16 user-defined characters before accepting input.  If &lt;tt&gt;Str&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is used, &lt;tt&gt;Str&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is string number &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, accessed with '''VARS:7(String):&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;'''.  Note that &lt;tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; must be contained in quotation marks ('''ALPHA:+''').

'''Summary:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Input 
:Disp X,Y
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Returns the (X,Y) coordinates of the graph cursor.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Input A
:Disp A
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Accepts a value from the keyboard, stores it in the variable called &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, and displays it.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Input &quot;APPLES&quot;,A
:Disp A
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Displays what the program is looking for, accepts and stores a numeric value from the keyboard in the variable called &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;. Then &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; is displayed.

== Prompt (not recommended) ==

&lt;tt&gt;Prompt&lt;/tt&gt;, '''PRGM:I/O:2''', is of the form &lt;tt&gt;:Prompt variableA[,variableB,...,variable n]&lt;/tt&gt;.  '''Prompt''' displays the variable name followed by '''=?''' for each variable, waiting for keypad input followed by '''ENTER''' before continuing.  Each value entered is stored in its respective variable.

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
:Prompt A
:Disp &quot;Value is &quot;, A
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Displays the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
[...]
A=?5       (Assuming the user inputs 5)
Value is
               5
[...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Please note: Since prompt is not customizable, it should never be used in a program intended for distribution. Use Input instead.'''

== Frequency Modulation ==

{{Wikipedia|Frequency modulation}}

If we make the frequency of our carrier wave a function of time, we can get a generalized function that looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{FM} = A\cos (2 \pi [f_c + ks(t)]t + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

We still have a carrier wave, but now we have the value ks(t) that we add to that carrier wave, to send our data.

As an important result, ks(t) must be less than the carrier frequency always, to avoid ambiguity and distortion.

::::[[Image:Amfm2.gif]]

===Deriving the FM Equation===

Recall that a general sinusoid is of the form:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_c  = \sin \left( {\omega _c t + \theta } \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Frequency modulation involves deviating a carrier frequency by some amount. If a sine wave is used to deviate the carrier, the expression for the frequency at any instant would be:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _i  = \omega _c  + \Delta \omega \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _i  = &lt;/math&gt;instantaneous frequency
::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _c  = &lt;/math&gt;carrier frequency
::::&lt;math&gt; \Delta \omega  = &lt;/math&gt;carrier deviation
::::&lt;math&gt;\omega _m  =&lt;/math&gt; modulation frequency

This expression describes a signal varying sinusoidally about some average frequency. However, we cannot simply substitute this expression into the general equation for a sinusoid to get the FM equation. This is because the sine operator acts on angles, not frequency. Therefore, we must define the instantaneous frequency in terms of angles.

It should be noted that the modulation signal amplitude governs the ''amount of carrier deviation'' while the modulation signal frequency governs the ''rate of carrier deviation''.


The term &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ''angular velocity'' (radians per second) and is related to frequency and angle by the following relationship:

::::&lt;math&gt;\omega {\rm{ = 2}}\pi {\rm{f = }}\frac{{d\theta }}{{dt}}&lt;/math&gt;


:To find the angle, we must integrate &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; with respect to time:

::::&lt;math&gt;\int {\omega dt = \theta } &lt;/math&gt;


:We can now find the instantaneous angle associated with the instantaneous frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
 \theta  = \int {\omega _i dt = \int {\left( {\omega _c  + \Delta \omega \sin \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)} } dt = \omega _c t - \frac{{\Delta \omega }}{{\omega _m }}\cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right) = \omega _c t - \frac{{\Delta f}}{{f_m }}\cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right) \\ 
 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


:This angle can now be substituted into the general carrier signal to define FM:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{fm}  = \sin \left( {\omega _c t - \frac{{\Delta f}}{{f_m }}\cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


:The ''FM modulation index'' is defined as the ratio of the carrier deviation to modulation frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt; m_{fm}  = \frac{{\Delta f}}{{f_m }}&lt;/math&gt;


:Consequently, the FM equation is often written as:

::::&lt;math&gt; e_{fm}  = \sin \left( {\omega _c t - m_{fm} \cos \left( {\omega _m t} \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Bessel's Functions===

{{wikipedia|Bessel function}}

This is a very complex expression and it is not readily apparent what the sidebands of this signal are like. The solution to this problem requires a knowledge of ''Bessel's function''s of the first kind and order ''p''. In open form, it resembles:

::::&lt;math&gt; J_p \left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty  {\frac{{\left( { - 1} \right)^k \left( {\frac{x}{2}} \right)^{2k + p} }}{{k!\left( {k + p} \right)!}}} &lt;/math&gt;

::where:

::::&lt;math&gt; J_p \left( x \right) = &lt;/math&gt; Magnitude of the frequency component
::::&lt;math&gt; p = &lt;/math&gt; Side frequency number (not to be confused with sidebands)
::::&lt;math&gt; x = &lt;/math&gt; Modulation index


:As a point of interest, Bessel's functions are a solution to the following equation:

::::&lt;math&gt;x^2\frac{{d^2 y}}{{dx^2 }} + x\frac{{dy}}{{dx}} + \left( {x^2  - p^2 } \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;


Bessel's functions occur in the theory of cylindrical and spherical waves, much like sine waves occur in the theory of plane waves.

It turns out that FM generates an infinite number of side frequencies (in both the upper and lower sidebands). Each side frequency is an integer multiple of the modulation signal frequency. The amplitude of higher order side frequencies decreases rapidly and can generally be ignored.

The amplitude of the carrier signal is also a function of the modulation index and under some conditions, its amplitude can actually go to zero. This does not mean that the signal disappears, but rather that all of the broadcast energy is redistributed to the side frequencies.

A plot of the carrier and first five side frequency amplitudes as a function of modulation index resembles: 

::[[Image:Bessel_Functions_1st_kind.gif|left|thumb]]

The Bessel coefficients have several interesting properties including:

::::&lt;math&gt; J_0^2  + 2\left( {J_1^2  + J_2^2  + J_3^2  +  \cdots } \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;


One very useful interpretation of this is: &lt;math&gt; J_0 &lt;/math&gt; represents the voltage amplitude of the carrier, &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; represents the amplitude of the 1st side frequency, &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; the 2nd side frequency etc.
Note that the sum of the squares (power) remains constant.

===FM Bandwidth===

FM generates upper and lower sidebands, each of which contain an infinite number of side frequencies. However, the FM bandwidth is not infinite because the amplitude of the higher order side frequencies decreases rapidly. ''Carson's Rule'' is often used to calculate the bandwidth, since it contains more than 90% of the FM signal.

::'''Carson's Rule''' 

{{wikipedia| Carson's rule}}

::::&lt;math&gt; B_{fm}  \approx 2\left( {m_{fm}  + 1} \right)f_m  = 2\left( {\Delta f + f_m } \right))&lt;/math&gt;


In commercial broadcast applications, for a purely monaural station, the maximum modulation index (&lt;math&gt;m_{fm}&lt;/math&gt;) = 75/15 = 5, coming from: the maximum carrier deviation (&lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;) = 75 kHz, and maximum modulation frequency (&lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) = 15 kHz.  The total broadcast spectrum according to Carson's rule is 180 kHz, but an additional 20 kHz  guard band is used to separate adjacent radio stations. Therefore, each FM radio station is allocated 200 kHz.

For stereo stations, the maximum modulation index is significantly reduced because the information needed to separate the channels has to be transmitted along with the mono audio signal. This increases the required bandwidth to 53 kHz. Hence, the max. modulation index is = 75/53 = 1.41509434... Radio Data System (RDS) information, increase this further to ~60 kHz, reducing the max. modulation index to 75/60 = 1.25.

===How FM Stereo works===
{{wikipedia|FM stereo}}
The mono signal is M = L + R, with the stereo difference being S = L - R. Adding both simultaneous equations together gives M + S = 2L + (R-R), recovering the left channel, while subtracting them recovers the right channel.
This is transmitted as a &lt;b&gt;double sideband suppressed carrier&lt;/b&gt; (DSBSC), which is essentially just an AM &quot;station&quot; going along, but without it's carrier being sent when there is nothing being transmitted on it. (&quot;Stations&quot; sent along with the main program (usually in ultrasonic frequencies) are known as &lt;i&gt;subcarriers&lt;/i&gt;.) 
A stereo &quot;pilot&quot; tone is used to let the receiver know that there is a stereo signal being received, and also to allow the suppressed carrier to be regenerated (by doubling the pilot tone's frequency) so the stereo difference signal can be demodulated just like a normal AM station and the resulting signals used to separate the audio into two channels.

RDS information is yet another &quot;AM station&quot; being sent along with the main program, but at 3x the pilot frequency (19 kHz x 3 = 57 kHz). It's contents are not audio, but analogue values meant to represent a digital signal which carries the station name and many other info like it's alternate frequencies, time of the day, program info, etc. &lt;!-- Having to be narrowband, the amount of info sent is doubled for the same bandwidth via quadrature amplitude modulation: one channel of information is transmitted with the carrier normally, while the other channel is sent with a carrier of the same frequency, but shifted in phase by 90­°. Listening on the two normally will have both channels come together, which cannot be decoded. So a carrier generated with the exact phase of the pilot tone but 3x the frequency is used to demodulate the first channel, while a 90° shifted carrier is used to demodulate the second channel. Both analogue values of both channels are then mapped to the corresponding digital bits.--&gt;

===Noise===

In AM systems, noise easily distorts the transmitted signal however, in FM systems any added noise must create a frequency deviation in order to be perceptible.

::[[Image:fm_noise.gif]]

The maximum frequency deviation due to random noise occurs when the noise is at right angles to the resultant signal. In the worst case the signal frequency has been deviated by:

::::&lt;math&gt;\delta  = \theta f_m &lt;/math&gt;


This shows that the deviation due to noise increases as the modulation frequency increases. Since noise power is the square of the noise voltage, the signal to noise ratio can significantly degrade. 

::[[image:noise_voltage.gif]]


To prevent this, the amplitude of the modulation signal is increased to keep the S/N ratio constant over the entire broadcast band. This is called pre-emphasis.

===Pre &amp; De-emphasis===

{{wikipedia|Preemphasis}}

Increasing the amplitude of high frequency baseband signals in the FM modulator (transmitter) must be compensated for in the FM demodulator (receiver) otherwise the signal would sound quite tinny (too much treble).

The standard curves resemble:

::[[Image:Pre_emphasis.gif|left|thumb]]


In commercial FM broadcast, the emphasis circuits consist of a simple RC network with a time constant of 75 &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;Sec and a corner frequency of 2125 Hz.

::[[Image:emphasis_circuit.gif]]


The magnitude of the pre-emphasis response is defined by:

::[[Image:pre_emphasis_equation.gif]]

== FM Transmission Power ==

{{SideBox|The equation for the transmitted power in a sinusoid is a fundamental equation. Remember it.}}

Since the value of the amplitude of the sine wave in FM does not change, the transmitted power is a constant. As a general rule, for a sinusoid with a constant amplitude, the transmitted power can be found as follows:

::::&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{A^2}{2R_L}&lt;/math&gt;

Where A is the amplitude of the sine wave, and R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the resistance of the load. In a normalized system, we set R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to 1.


The Bessel coefficients can be used to determine the power in the carrier and any side frequency:

::::&lt;math&gt;  P_C  = P_T \left( {J_0^2  + 2\left( {J_1^2  + J_2^2  + J_3^2  +  \cdots } \right)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;P_C&lt;/math&gt; is the power in the unmodulated carrier. 
::&lt;math&gt;P_T&lt;/math&gt; is the total power and is by definition equal to the unmodulated carrier power. 

As the modulation index varies, the individual Bessel coefficients change and power is redistributed from the carrier to the side frequencies.

== FM Transmitters ==

FM Transmitters can be easily implemented using a VCO (see why we discussed Voltage Controlled Oscillators, in the first section?), because a VCO converts an input voltage (our input signal) to a frequency (our modulated output).

 Signal -----&gt;|VCO|-----&gt; FM Signal

== FM Receivers ==

Any angle modulation receiver needs to have several components:

#A limiter, to remove abnormal amplitude values
#bandpass filter, to separate the out-of-band noise.
#A Discriminator, to change a frequency back to a voltage
#A lowpass filter, to remove noise added by the discriminator.

A discriminator is essentially a differentiator in line with an envelope detector:

 FM ----&gt;|Differentiator|----&gt;|Envelope Filter|----&gt; Signal

Also, you can add in a blocking capacitor to remove any DC components of the signal, if needed.</text>

== Phase Modulation ==

Phase modulation is most commonly used to convey digital signals. All high performance modems today use phase modulation.

Similar to FM (frequency modulation), is Phase modulation. (We will show how they are the same in the next chapter.)  If we alter the value of the phase according to a particular function, we will get the following generalized PM function:

&lt;math&gt;s_{PM} = A\cos (2 \pi f_c t + \alpha s(t))&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the fact that &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; \alpha s(t) \le \pi&lt;/math&gt; for all values of t. If this relationship is not satisfied, then the phase angle is said to be ''wrapped''.


===BPSK Modulator===

The binary phase shift keyed  modulator is the simplest of app PSK modulators since it has only two output phase states. It is generally a multiplier which can either be an IC (integrated circuit) or ring modulator.

:::[[Image:BPSK_modulator.gif]]


The output has two phase states:

:::[[Image:BPSK_output.gif]]


In the above illustration, the duration of each of the phase states corresponds to one signaling element or baud. The baud rate is therefor equal to the bit rate.

The spectrum of the BPSK signal will depend upon the data being transmitted, but it is very easy to sketch it for the highest data rate input.

:::[[Image:sq_wave_spectrum.gif]]


The resultant BPSK spectrum is:

:::[[Image:BPSK_spectrum.gif]]


===QPSK Modulators (4-PSK)===

Quadrature modulation uses two data channels denoted I (in phase) and Q (quadrature phase) displaced by 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to each other. It may seem somewhat paradoxical, that although these two channels are combined prior to transmission, they do not interfere with each other.

:::[[Image:quadrature_modulator.gif]]


The receiver is quite capable of separating them because of their quadrature or orthogonal nature.

:::[[Image:Quadrature_demodulator.gif]]


In the most basic configuration, there are 4 possible output phases. This suggests that each output symbol correspond to 2 bits of binary information. Since several bits can be encoded into a baud, the bit rate exceeds the baud rate.

:::[[Image:QPSK.gif]]


The first thing that happens in this circuit is that the incoming bits are organized into groups of 2 called dibits. They are separated into 2 data streams and kept constant over the dibit period.

:::[[Image:Dibit.gif]]


Each data stream is fed to a BPSK modulator. However, orthogonal carriers feed the two modulators. The output of the I channel modulator resembles:

:::[[Image:I_mod_out.gif]]


The output of the Q channel modulator resembles

:::[[Image:Q_mod_out.gif]]


Combining the I and Q channels has the effect of rotating the output state by 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

:::[[Image:QPSK_output_phase_states.gif]]


Rotating the output reference to 45&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; for the sake of clarity, the transmitted output for this particular data sequence is therefor:

:::[[Image:QPSK_output.gif]]


===8-PSK===

This process of encoding more bits into each output baud or phase state can be continued. Organizing binary bits into 3 bytes corresponds to 8 different conditions.

The output constellation diagram for the 8 different phase states is:

::::[[Image:Constellation_8.gif]]


From this diagram it is readily apparent that two different amplitudes are needed on the I and Q channels. If the A bit is used to control the polarity of the I channel and the B bit the polarity of the Q channel, then the C bit can be used to define the two different amplitudes. In order to evenly space the phase states; the amplitudes must be ± 0.38 and ± 0.92. The magnitude of the I and Q channel signals must always be different. An inverter can be used to assure this condition.

The input bit stream is organized into 3 bit bytes. Each bit is sent to a different location to control a certain aspect of the modulator. The inputs to the 2 - 4 level converter are 0’s or 1’s but the output is ± 0.38 or ± 0.92, depending on the C bit.

::::[[Image:8_PSK.gif]]

== Wrapped/Unwrapped Phase ==

The phase angle is a circular quantity, with the restriction &lt;math&gt;0 = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, if we wrap the phase a complete 360 degrees around, the receiver will not know the difference, and the transmission will fail. When the phase exceeds 360 degrees, the phase value is said to be '''wrapped'''. It is highly difficult to construct a communication system that can detect and decode a wrapped phase value.

== PM Transmitter ==

PM signals can be transmitted using a technique very similar to FM transmitters. The only difference is that we need to add a differentiator to it:

 Signal ----&gt;|Differentiator|----&gt;|VCO|----&gt; PM Signal

== PM Receiver ==

PM receivers have all the same parts as an FM receiver, except for the 3rd step:

#A limiter, to remove abnormal amplitude values
#bandpass filter, to separate the out-of-band noise.
#A Phase detector, to convert a phase back into a voltage
#A lowpass filter, to remove noise added by the discriminator.

Phase detectors can be created using a Phase-Locked-Loop (again, see why we discussed them first?).</text>

===MegaCD Changes===
The following shows changes to the 68K Memory Map with a MegaCD/SegaCD attached:

The MegaCD 68K may be stopped/reset, and the available &quot;Program RAM&quot; bank may be set by use of the &quot;Gate Array&quot;.

#The name of the console. Should be either &quot;SEGA GENESIS&quot; or &quot;SEGA MEGA DRIVE&quot; (depending on the region you are planning to program your game for). Must be 16 characters long.
#Firm name and build date. Must be 16 characters long, firm name is four characters long.
#Domestic name. Must be 48 characters long.
#International name. Must be 48 characters long.
#Program type and serial number. First two characters are either &quot;GM&quot; (game) or &quot;AL&quot; (educational). After the space, a series of eight digits gives the serial number. The final two digits give the version number.
#[[#Checksum|Checksum]].
#I/O device support (unused)
#Start of the ROM. This should always be 0.
#End of the ROM. It's best to use a label at the end of your source file to determine this.
#Start of RAM. Just about every game starts at $FF0000, but RAM is mirrored at several other places, and you can use those if you want.
#End of RAM. Should be $FFFF after the starting point.
#Backup RAM ID. Fill this with spaces if there is none, otherwise, use this formula:&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;dc.b &quot;RA&quot;,%1x1yy000,%0010000&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;where x is true when the RAM is for backup and false if not. (I've no idea what the difference is.) yy is 11 if addressing is odd bytes only, 10 if even only, and 00 if both.
#Start address of backup RAM. Fill with spaces if there is no backup RAM.
#End address of backup RAM.
#Modem support. Fill with spaces if there is no modem, otherwise follow this formula:&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&quot;MOxxxxyy.zzz&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;where xxxx is the firm name, yy is the modem number, and zzz is the version number. (This is also unused)
#Notes. Put whatever you want here, and fill the empty spaces with zeroes.
#Country codes. J is for Japan, U is for the United States, and E is for Europe. You need to fill in the rest of this field with spaces. So, JU for the country code would tell the Sega that the game is for Japan and the US, JUE would tell it that it is for Japan, the US, and Europe

===TMSS===
Back in 1990, Accolade released a few unlicensed games for the Genesis. Sega was not pleased about this, so they invented TMSS and put it on all new consoles they manufactured. TMSS forces the game to write the ASCII string &quot;SEGA&quot; to $A14000 within a short period of time, or the VDP will be deactivated. On version 0 of the console, this location is reserved, and writing here may cause a crash, so the game has to first make sure that it's running on a console that has TMSS. Sega uses the following routine for that:
&lt;pre&gt;
         move.b  $A10001,d0
         andi.b  #$0F,d0
         beq.b   version_0
         move.l  #'SEGA',$A14000
version_0:
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Checksum===
The checksum is a 16-bit number (word) located in the header which is present in all licensed games.It was used to check the integrity of the data by storing a pre-calculated number (the checksum) using the original data and comparing it with the checksum of the existing data in the cart, probably to prevent code changes without authorization (in-house).

The checksum is, basically, the sum of the whole cart, all its bytes, starting at address $200. As you can guess, if only a byte is changed the checksum changes too. Somewhat like the CRC/CRC32 algorithms, though those are much more accurate than this method.

You don't need to implement the checksum if you program your own homebrew rom, because the checksum is exclusively checked by software. But, anyway, this is how a typical checksum routine from a licensed game would look.
&lt;pre&gt;
		movea.l	#$200,a0
		movea.l	#ROM_End,a1 
		move.l	(a1),d0
		moveq	#0,d1
loop:
		add.w	(a0)+,d1
		cmp.l	a0,d0
		bcc.s	loop
		movea.l	#$18E,a1	; Checksum
		cmp.w	(a1),d1
		bne.w	WrongChecksum
&lt;/pre&gt;

To disable it, comment out that last branch. If you prefer to fix the checksum, grab the Fix Checksum utility from [http://www.hacking-cult.org Hacking CulT's] download section.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Bluefoxicy. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Bluefoxicy~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

=Introduction=

'''MySQL''' is an open source relational database that supports XML.  You can use the MySQL command line or a programming language of your choice to convert your MySQL databases and or tables to a well formed XML document.



== Supported Versions ==

XML is supported in MySQL version 3.23.48 and higher. A free version of MySQL can be downloaded from [http://www.MySQL.com MySQL.com].

== Using the MySQL Command Line ==
Use the --xml or -X option with either the mysqldump or mysql command to produce XML output.  

'''mysqldump Syntax:'''

 mysqldump --xml -u username -p databasename [tablename] &gt; filename.xml

'''mysql Syntax:'''

 \T &quot;filename.xml&quot;
 mysql -X -u username -p databasename [tablename]

'''OR'''

 \T &quot;filename.xml&quot;
 mysql -X -u username -p databasename tablename -e
 'select columnname, columnname
  from tablename'

In the latter mysql syntax example, you can also specify a where condition as well as restrict the where condition just as you would in a regular sql select statement.


'''Explanation of commands and options:'''

'''mysqldump''' is a mysql output command.

'''\T''' is a mysql output command.

'''-e''' is a mysql option that tells mysql to execute the following select statement.

'''--xml''' is the mysql option for producing XML output.

'''-u''' is a mysql option which tells mysql that the next command line item is your username.

'''username''' is your mysql username.  It will be used to authenticate you to the mysql database.

'''-p''' is a mysqldump option that tells mysql that the next command line item is your password.  If do not want your password to be visible on the command line, then do not supply your password after the -p option and mysql will prompt you for it later.

'''databasename''' is the name of the database that you want to output to xml.

'''tablename''' is the name of the table that you want to output to xml.  Supplying the tablename is optional.

The '''&gt;''' symbol is the output symbol that tells mysql to output the results to the following filename.

'''filename.xml''' is the filename that you want to output the XML results.

== General Overview ==

'''''Azkaban''''' is the wizard prison.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Azkaban is a horrendous place, where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], along with many [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], were imprisoned after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] fell from power. Guarded by the hideous [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|dementors]], it is located on a remote island and is virtually escape proof. According to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], it is a &quot;fortress... set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheerful thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.&quot; Sirius Black is the first person known to have escaped. Although several Death Eaters also later escaped, it is believed they were able to escape only because the Dementors had left the prison, having been promised richer feeding if they became loyal to Voldemort.

The first mention of Azkaban is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], when it is mentioned only in passing. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], we are properly introduced to the nature of the place, when it is decided by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who was accused of opening the Chamber fifty years earlier, was responsible for opening it again. When the decision to send him to Azkaban as a preventative measure is announced, we see Hagrid's fear of the place, and later his relief at being released. However, the full nature of the place is not fully explained until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']].

From there, it is mentioned in passing, as people are arrested and sent to Azkaban, and as people break out. By [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], the reader may begin to feel, correctly as it turns out, that Azkaban should be fitted with revolving doors.

== Analysis ==

Quite clearly, the first thing one must do when you imprison a wizard is to confiscate his wand; a wizard with a wand is as well-armed as a Muggle with a gun, and significantly more capable. Yet wizards do have some ability to perform magic without wands; we see Harry do so on a number of occasions, when his tension is particularly high. We also believe [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]] does not require wands. There are evidently spells that can prevent Apparition, and of course those must be set on the prison proper. That does leave the possibility of an escape being carried out by a Wizard or Witch who does wandless magic when very tense. This may be the rationale for the Dementors: by damping all good feelings, it may be impossible for the prisoners to become agitated enough to perform wandless magic. Despite all these safeguards, however, it is certainly possible for a witch or wizard to break out of Azkaban; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 27|Dumbledore has stated]] that he could break out of Azkaban if he was imprisoned, and large numbers of Death Eaters do so on two known occasions, though it must be noted that both of these major breakouts occurred after the Dementors had abandoned Azkaban to enter Voldemort's service.

One does rather feel that the use of Dementors is a bit excessive, however. You do not rehabilitate an evil wizard by driving him insane. However, we must also note that the entire penal situation in the Wizarding world seems a bit excessive, as people are imprisoned for lengthy periods without benefit of trial — Rubeus Hagrid, for instance, is imprisoned for some months on suspicion alone, and Sirius Black is imprisoned for twelve years without a trial. Granted that this situation may have sprung from adversity, and have been done in reaction to the appearance and activities of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], still one would think that with the threat abated, the use of Azkaban might fall off. That does not seem to happen, however.

We find out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|the Animagus transformation]] does not require a wand, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] is able to transform when he is incarcerated and thus wandless. We believe he was able to escape because he was an unregistered Animagus; presumably, there is some way to prevent the transformation that would be used on an incarcerated registered Animagus, likely a variant of the unnamed spell that Sirius and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] used to unmask [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. However, as there are so very few Animagi in existence, it may have been considered unnecessary to provide for their being incarcerated.

As mentioned, the use of Azkaban as a deterrent in the series seems to be excessive; it is only after Voldemort's second fall, and the accession of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] to the position of Minister for Magic, that the penal system is returned to what it should be. J.K. Rowling mentioned, in one of the interviews she gave after the release of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], that after Voldemort's death, one of the things [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]] does as Minister for Magic is to retire control of Azkaban from the Dementors. This is part of what makes the magical world in the epilogue of the book &quot;a sunnier one&quot;.

== Learning Objectives ==
* What is XQL?
* What is an XQL Query?
* Tutorial
* What are the different components of XQL?

== Introduction ==

 
		&lt;p&gt;As more and more information is either stored in XML, exchanged in
		  XML, or presented as XML through various interfaces, the ability to
		  intelligently query our XML data sources becomes increasingly important. XML
		  documents are structured documents &amp;ndash; they blur the distinction between
		  data and documents, allowing documents to be treated as data sources, and
		  traditional data sources to be treated as documents.&lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt;XQL is a query language designed specifically for XML. In the same
		  sense that SQL is a query language for relational tables and OQL is a query
		  language for objects stored in an object database, XQL is a query language for
		  XML documents. The basic constructs of XQL correspond directly to the basic
		  structures of XML, and XQL is closely related to XPath, the common locator
		  syntax used by XSL and XPointers. Since queries, transformation patterns, and
		  links are all based on patterns in structures found in possible XML documents,
		  a common model for the pattern language used in these three applications is
		  both possible and desirable, and a common syntax to express the patterns
		  expressed by that model simplifies the task of the user who must master a
		  variety of XML-related technologies. Although XQL originated before XSL
		  Patterns, there were strong similarities between the two languages, and we have
		  adopted XPath syntax for the constructs which differed. Not all constructs
		  found in XPath were needed for queries, and some constructs used in XQL are not
		  found in XPath, but the two languages share a common subset. &lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt;The XQL language described in this chapter contains several features not
		  found in previously published versions of the language, including joins, links,
		  text containment, and extensible functions. These new features are inspired in
		  large part by discussions stemming from the W3C QL '98 Workshop, and make it
		  possible to combine information from heterogeneous data sources in powerful
		  ways. Great care has been made to maintain the fundamental simplicity of XQL
		  while adding these features.&lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt;This chapter is intended as input for the upcoming W3C Query Language
		  Activity, and for the further development of XPath.&lt;/p&gt;

== XML Query Language ==

		 
		&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, structured queries have been used primarily for
		  relational or object oriented databases, and documents were queried with
		  relatively unstructured full-text queries. Although quite sophisticated query
		  engines for structured documents have existed for some time, they have not been
		  a mainstream application. In the last year, a number of very different
		  approaches to querying XML have been proposed, with several distinct
		  perspectives on what constitutes a query. Several particularly interesting
		  proposals have come from the semi-structured database community, including
		  XML-QL and Lorel, and adopt semi-structured approaches to XML. This proposal
		  incorporates several ideas from those languages into XQL.&lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt;XQL was designed to be used in a number of different XML environments,
		  using a syntax that may be used in XML attributes, embedded in programming
		  languages, or incorporated in URIs. From the beginning, we have endeavored to
		  keep the language simple and small, and we have been careful not to add
		  functionality that would make it difficult to implement XQL. During the last
		  year, we have been persuaded to add several powerful new features that allow
		  users to combine information from multiple sources, use the relationships
		  expressed in links as part of a query, and search based on text containment.
		  Queries that can make use of information in multiple documents allow the
		  information contained in those documents to be reused in ways not foreseen by
		  the people who created the original documents. This is extremely useful when
		  many documents or data sources may each contain part of the information needed
		  on a given topic. For instance, suppose one document contains a set of
		  recommended books for a given course of study, another lists books and prices
		  for a store, and third contains a set of reviews of books. A query can be
		  constructed to list recommended books, their prices, and the reviews they have
		  received. &lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt;XQL is closely related to XPath, and we hope to be able to maintain
		  compatibility with XPath as it evolves. We see XQL as complementary to XSLT,
		  which may be used for sophisticated reshaping and formatting of query results.
		  &lt;/p&gt;

== XML as a Data Model ==

		   
		  &lt;p&gt;An important motivation for the design of XQL is the realization
			 that XML has its own implied data model, which is neither that of traditional
			 relational databases nor that of object oriented or object-relational
			 databases. In XQL, a document is an ordered, labelled tree, with nodes to
			 represent the document entity, elements, attributes, processing instructions,
			 and comments. The model is compatible with the 
			 XML Information Set 
			 (http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/1999/04/WD-xml-infoset-19990428.html).
			 &lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the relationships among data contain a
			 large proportion of the information contained in a document, which is one of
			 the reasons that structured document formats like XML are useful in the first
			 place. The original formulation of XQL was based completely on the tree
			 structure of XML documents:&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;ol&gt; 
			 &lt;li&gt; 
				&lt;p&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/p&gt; 
				&lt;ol&gt; 
				  &lt;li&gt; 
					 &lt;p&gt;parent/child &lt;/p&gt; 
				  &lt;/li&gt; 
				  &lt;li&gt; 
					 &lt;p&gt;ancestor/descendant &lt;/p&gt; 
				  &lt;/li&gt; 
				&lt;/ol&gt; 
			 &lt;/li&gt; 
			 &lt;li&gt; 
				&lt;p&gt;Sequence (within a sibling list or in document order) &lt;/p&gt; 
			 &lt;/li&gt; 
			 &lt;li&gt; 
				&lt;p&gt;Position (within a sibling list or in document order) &lt;/p&gt; 
				&lt;ol&gt; 
				  &lt;li&gt; 
					 &lt;p&gt;absolute &lt;/p&gt; 
				  &lt;/li&gt; 
				  &lt;li&gt; 
					 &lt;p&gt;relative&lt;/p&gt; 
				  &lt;/li&gt; 
				  &lt;li&gt; 
					 &lt;p&gt;ranges&lt;/p&gt; 
				  &lt;/li&gt; 
				&lt;/ol&gt; 
			 &lt;/li&gt; 
		  &lt;/ol&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;These relationships have long been basic to the XPointer model, and
			 are now reflected in XPath in the form of axes. In XQL, all queries use the
			 child axis, so we will speak in terms of parent/child and ancestor/descendant
			 relationships rather than use the term &lt;b&gt;Locator Path&lt;/b&gt; from the XPath
			 Working Draft.&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;The current draft extends this model to support the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;ol&gt; 
			 &lt;li&gt; 
				&lt;p&gt;Ad-hoc relationships established via joins&lt;/p&gt; 
			 &lt;/li&gt; 
			 &lt;li&gt; 
				&lt;p&gt;Dereferencing of links&lt;/p&gt; 
			 &lt;/li&gt; 
		  &lt;/ol&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;Joins allow subtrees of documents to be combined in queries; links
			 allow queries to support references as well as tree structure.&lt;/p&gt;

== What is an XML Query? ==
		   
		  &lt;p&gt;In XQL, a query returns XML document nodes from one or more XML
			 documents. To examine the characteristics of an XQL query, it is useful to
			 consider four basic questions about the environment in which a query takes
			 place: 
			 &lt;ol&gt; 
				&lt;li&gt; 
				  What is a database?  
				&lt;/li&gt; 
				&lt;li&gt; 
				  What is the query language? 
				&lt;/li&gt; 
				&lt;li&gt; 
				  What is the input to a query? 				&lt;/li&gt; 
				&lt;li&gt; 
				  What is the result of a query?  
				&lt;/li&gt; 
			 &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;The following table provides a brief answer to each of these
			 questions, including a comparison with the SQL query language, which is widely
			 used for querying relational databases:&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
			  
				&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;SQL&lt;/td&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;XQL&lt;/td&gt; 
				&lt;/tr&gt; 
			  
			
				&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;The database is a set of tables.&lt;/td&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;The database is a set of one or more XML documents.&lt;/td&gt; 
				&lt;/tr&gt; 
				&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;Queries are done in SQL, a query language that uses the
					 structure of tables as a basic model.&lt;/td&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;Queries are done in XQL, a query language that uses the
					 structure of XML documents as a basic model.&lt;/td&gt; 
				&lt;/tr&gt; 
				&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;The FROM clause determines the tables which are examined by
					 the query.&lt;/td&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;A query is given a list of input nodes from one or more
					 documents. &lt;/td&gt; 
				&lt;/tr&gt; 
				&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;The result of a query is a table containing a set of rows;
					 this table may serve as the basis for further queries. &lt;/td&gt; 
				  &lt;td&gt;The result of a query is a list of XML document nodes, which
					 may serve as the basis for further queries. &lt;/td&gt; 
				&lt;/tr&gt; 
			  
		  &lt;/table&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;From the preceding table, it should be clear that document nodes
			 play a central role in XQL queries. These nodes are an abstraction. Any real
			 XQL implementation will find some concrete way to implement the nodes used in
			 queries. For instance, XQL engines may represent the input to a query via DOM
			 nodes, XSL nodes, index structures, or XML text. Any of these might also be
			 used to represent the results of queries; in addition, hyperlinks or other
			 references into the original document might be used, a new virtual document
			 might be created, or DOM Level Two TreeWalkers or Iterators might be used.&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;The nodes which form the input to a query may come from a variety of
			 different sources. They may be the result of a prior query, the contents of a
			 document repository, the nodes from a Document Object Model Nodelist, or any
			 other source that identifies nodes from one or more documents. XQL does not
			 specify how these nodes are brought to the query. Current XQL implementations
			 take a variety of approaches, including the following: using Document Object
			 Model subtrees as the basis for a query, querying whole documents supplied as
			 the input to a Unix-style pipe, reading a document from the command line, using
			 data dictionaries or repository directory structures to identify nodes to be
			 queried, and identifying documents using a URL. This proposal adds support for
			 merging information from heterogeneous data sources using joins.&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;In XQL, nodes have identity, and they retain their identity,
			 containment relationships, and sequence in query results. Grouping operators
			 allow levels of a tree to be omitted, while still retaining the relative
			 sequence and containment of the nodes which are returned by a query. Joins
			 allow subtrees from one data source to be inserted into another document
			 subtree, subject to the join conditions. Link functions are similar to joins,
			 allowing a hypertext link in a document to be replaced by the node or nodes to
			 which it refers. Some functions in XQL return values, which may be boolean,
			 integer, or string. These values are also treated as nodes in the query model.
			 &lt;/p&gt;

== XQL Tutorial ==

		   
		  &lt;p&gt;Before going into further detail, we feel it would be helpful to
			 present some typical XQL queries to help convey a feeling for the language.
			 This tutorial discusses the simplest XQL queries, which are also likely to be
			 the most common. In this tutorial, we will present a quick overview of XQL
			 without taking the time to be precise.  &lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt;A simple string is interpreted as an element name. For instance,
			 this query specification returns all &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; elements:&lt;/p&gt; 
		  &lt;p&gt; 
 
			 &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;



		&lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt;The child operator (&quot;/&quot;) indicates hierarchy. This query
		  specification returns &amp;lt;author&amp;gt; elements that are children of
		  &amp;lt;front&amp;gt; elements: &lt;/p&gt; 
		&lt;p&gt; 
 
		  &lt;code&gt;front/author&lt;/code&gt;



	 &lt;/p&gt; 
	 &lt;p&gt;The root of a document may be indicated by a leading &quot;/&quot;
		operator: &lt;/p&gt; 
	 &lt;p&gt; 
 
		&lt;code&gt;/novel/front/author&lt;/code&gt;



  &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt; 
	 In XQL, the root of a document refers to the document entity, in
		the technical XML sense, which is basically equivalent to the document itself.
		It is not the same as the root element, which is the element that contains the
		rest of the elements in the document. The document root always contains the
		root element, but it may also contain a doctype, processing instructions, and
		comments. In this example,&amp;lt;novel&amp;gt; would be the root element.  
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Paths are always described from the top down, and unless otherwise
	 specified, the right-most element on the path is returned. For instance, in the
	 above example, &amp;lt;author&amp;gt; elements would be returned. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The content of an element or the value of an attribute may be specified
	 using the equals operator (&quot;=&quot;). The following returns all authors
	 with the name &quot;Theodore Seuss Geisel&quot; that are children of the
	 &amp;lt;front&amp;gt; element:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; 
 
	 &lt;code&gt;front/author='Theodore Seuss
Geisel'&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Attribute names begin with &quot;@&quot;. They are treated as children of
  the elements to which they belong:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
  &lt;code&gt;front/author/address/@type='email'&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The descendant operator (&quot;//&quot;) indicates any number of intervening
levels. The following shows addresses anywhere within &amp;lt;front&amp;gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;front//address&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When the descendant operator is found at the start of a path, it means all
nodes descended from the document. This query will find any address in the
document:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;//address&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The filter operator (&quot;[ ]&quot;) filters the set of nodes to its left
based on the conditions inside the brackets. The following query returns
addresses; each of these addresses must have a nattribute called
&quot;type&quot; with the value &quot;email&quot;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;front/author/address[@type='email']&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note that&quot;address[@type='email']&quot; returns addresses,
but&quot;address/@type='email'&quot; returns type attributes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Multiple conditions may be combined using Boolean operators. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;front/author='Theodore Seuss
Geisel'[@gender='male' and @shoesize='9EEEE']
&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Brackets are also used for subscripts, which indicate position within a
document. The following refers to sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8, plus the last
section:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;section[1,3 to
5, 8, -1]&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Conditions and subscripts may not both occur in the same brackets, but both
uses of brackets may occur in the same query. The following refers to the first
three sections whose level attributes have the value &quot;3&quot;; in other
words, it returns the first three &quot;level3&quot; sections:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;section[@level='3'][1 to 2]&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the basics, let's take a look at a document and try some
XQL queries on it. The following is an invoice document. Traditionally,
invoices are often stored in databases, but invoices are both documents and
data. XQL is designed to work on both documents and data, provided they are
represented via XML through some interface. This document will be the basis for
the sample queries that follow:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at some sample queries. For these examples, we will present
query results as text, using a serialization approach described in the section
&quot;Query Results and Serialization&quot;. In general, XQL queries return lists of
nodes, which may be represented in any way convenient to the environment in
which the query is performed, e.g. as DOM nodes, serialized XML text,
XPointers, hyperlinks, or by creating an iterator to navigate the results.
Since XML text is easily read, we find it suitable as a way of representing
results in our examples.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we wanted to see just the customers from the database. We could do
the following query:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Query:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;//customer&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;xql:result&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;customer&amp;gt; Wile E. Coyote, Death Valley, CA &amp;lt;/customer&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;customer&amp;gt; Camp Mertz &amp;lt;/customer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xql:result&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We might want to look at all the products manufactured by BSA. This query
would do the trick:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;
//product[@maker='BSA']&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;xql:result&amp;gt;      
  &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;BSA&quot; prod_name=&quot;left-handed smoke shifter&quot; price=&quot;16.00&quot;/&amp;gt;      
  &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;BSA&quot; prod_name=&quot;snipe call&quot; price=&quot;13.00&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xql:result&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Filters are particularly useful when specifying conditions on paths that are
not the same as what is returned. For instance, the following query returns the
products ordered by Camp Mertz:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;//invoice[customer='Wile E. Coyote, Death Valley,
CA']//product&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;xql:result&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;ACME&quot; prod_name=&quot;screwdriver&quot; price=&quot;80.00&quot;/&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;ACME&quot; prod_name=&quot;power wrench&quot; price=&quot;20.00&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xql:result&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the tutorial, which covers only the most basic features
of XQL. For examples illustrating newer or more advanced features, such as
return operators, sequence, joins, references, and user-defined functions, see
the appropriate parts of the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

== XQLExpressions ==

 
&lt;p&gt;An XQL query is always evaluated for a &lt;b&gt;context&lt;/b&gt;, which is a list
of document nodes. The initial context for a query is known as the &lt;b&gt;start
context&lt;/b&gt;. In XQL, the nodes in a start context may come from different
documents, and even if they are in the same document, there is no assumption
that they come from contiguous portions of the document. Some XQL operators
establish a new context in which a subexpression will be evaluated; for
instance, in the expression &quot;author/name&quot;, &quot;author&quot; is evaluated in the start
context. For each author, the &quot;/&quot; operator establishes a new context consisting
of the children of that author, and &quot;name&quot; is evaluated in that context. The
operators that establish a new context are /, //, and [].&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt; 
In XSL, expressions are evaluated with respect to a node which is
called the context node. Our use of the term &quot;context&quot; is intended to allow
semantic consistency with XSL Patterns without imposing unecessary restrictions
on the query language. As a consequence, XSL Patterns are defined in terms of
children of the context node, and XQL queries are defined in terms of the
context node directly. We maintain the correspondence of XSL Pattern
definitions and XQL definitions by constructing an imaginary context node that
contains the nodes of the context, and allowing the XSL term &quot;.&quot; to map to this
context node. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

== Terms ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt;The following expressions are &lt;b&gt;terms&lt;/b&gt;, which select particular
nodes from the context based on the type or name of the node:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;element name&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is element and the node name
is &quot;n&quot;.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;element name with wildcards&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is element.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;@n&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;attribute name&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is attribute and the node name
is &quot;n&quot;.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;@*&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;attribute name with wildcards&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is attribute.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;text()&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;text node&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is text.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;comment()&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;comment&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is comment.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;pi()&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;processing instruction&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is processing
instruction.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;pi(&quot;v&quot;)&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;processing instruction with target&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context where the node type is processing instruction and
the target is &quot;v&quot;.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;context node&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;The node which is the parent to the nodes in the context - this node may be
real or imaginary.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt;

== Namespaces and names ==


&lt;p&gt;In XML expressions, names may be associated with namespace prefixes. A
namespace prefix can be declared using a variable declaration. In the following
query, the first line declares &quot;b&quot; to be a variable equivalent to the namespace
URL &quot;http://www.TwiceSoldTales.com&quot;. The second line of the query searches for
all &amp;lt;book&amp;gt; elements belonging to this namespace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;b := &quot;http://www.TwiceSoldTales.com&quot;;
//b:book&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An XML document may well use a different namespace prefix for the same
namespace URI. Matching is done on the basis of the namespace URI, not the
prefix associated with it in the document or in the XQL query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XQL expressions can explicitly state whether namespaces should be taken into
account when matching node names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;table&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element named &amp;lt;table&amp;gt;, regardless of the namespace to which it
belongs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;html:table&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element named &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; that belongs to the namespace indicated by
the prefix &quot;html&quot;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element, regardless of the namespace to which it belongs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;:table&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element named &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; for which no namespace has been
declared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;*:table&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element named &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; for which a namespace has been
declared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;html:*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element belonging to the namespace associated with the prefix
&quot;html&quot;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;:*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element for which no namespace has been declared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;*:*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Any element for which a namespace has been declared.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same conventions apply to attribute names. In attribute names, the
attribute prefix comes before the namespace prefix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;@lib:isbn&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namespaces are preserved in the output of a query. To change the namespaces
of nodes in the output, use the 
Renaming Operator.&lt;/p&gt;

== Comparisons ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt;Comparisons add constraints based on the content or value of nodes. Consider
the following examples:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;author=&quot;Washington Irving&quot;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;@id=&quot;id-sec-0203&quot;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;text() = &quot;Whan that Aprille with his shoures soughte&quot;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the node type on the left hand of the comparison, it is
compared to the value on the right. For systems that use a schema that supports
data types, they are used in comparisons:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;books[pub_date &amp;lt; date(&quot;1990-01-01&quot;)]
&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since some environments in which XQL is used have restricted character sets,
e.g. URIs or queries stored in attribute values, many comparisons have an
alternative syntax that meets the syntactic constraints of these environments.
For instance, the following two queries are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;books[pub_date &amp;lt; date(&quot;1990-01-01&quot;)]
&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;books[pub_date lt date(&quot;1990-01-01&quot;)]
&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following comparison operators are available in XQL:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Equality&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n=&quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n eq &quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Case insensitive comparison&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n ieq &quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Inequality&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n !=&quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n ne &quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Text containment&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n contains &quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Case insensitive text containment&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n icontains &quot;value&quot;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Text comparisons support the wildcard characters &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot;. Consider the
following example:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Data:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;editor&amp;gt;   
  &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;first&amp;gt; Ramesh &amp;lt;/first&amp;gt; 
	 &amp;lt;last&amp;gt; Lekshmynarayanan &amp;lt;/last&amp;gt; 
  &amp;lt;/name&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;/editor&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/customer&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Query: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;
//(editor contains &quot;Leksh*&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The value &quot;Leksh*&quot; matches the name &quot;Lekshmynarayanan&quot;, and the
&amp;lt;editor&amp;gt; element is returned.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following operators may be defined in XQL environments that support data
types:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Less than&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n &amp;lt; value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n lt value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Less than or equals&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n &amp;lt;=value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n lte value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Greater than&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n &amp;gt; value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n gt value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Greater than or equals&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n &amp;gt;=value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;n gte value&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt;

== Hierarchy and Filters ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt;These operators establish a new search context and evaluate a subexpression
within that context. In this table, Q1 and Q2 are used to denote arbitrary XQL
expressions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Q1/Q2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;parent/child&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Children of nodes that satisfy Q1, evaluated in the current context, such
that the children satisfy Q2. Q2 is evaluated separately for the child list of
each node in Q1; the nodes to which each child list evaluates are unioned
together. &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Q1//Q2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;ancestor/descendant&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Descendants of nodes that satisfy Q1, evaluated in the current context,
such that the descendants satisfy Q2. Q2 is evaluated separately for each child
list of each node in Q1, and recursively for each node in the child list; the
nodes to which each child list evaluates are unioned together. &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Q1[Q2]&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;filter&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Nodes that satisfy Q1, evaluated in the current context, containing
children that satisfy Q2. Q2 is evaluated separately for the child list of each
node in Q1; the nodes to which each child list evaluates are unioned together.
&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Q1[poslist]&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;subscript&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Nodes that satisfy Q1, evaluated in the current context, whose position in
the evaluation list is contained in the poslist. &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt;

== Boolean and Set Operators ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt;Terms or other XQL expressions may be combined using &lt;b&gt;boolean
operators&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;set operators&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;not(q)&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;negation&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;All nodes in the context for which the expression q evaluates to null.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;q1 union q2 &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;union&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;The union of q1 and q2, evaluated in the context.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;q1 intersect q2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;intersection&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;The intersection of q1 and q2, evaluated in the context.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;q1 | q2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;union &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;The union of q1 and q2, evaluated in the context.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;q1 ~ q2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;both&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If both q1 and q2 are non-empty, returns q1 union q2; if either is empty,
returns the empty list.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;q1 or q2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;or&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;(Boolean) If the union of q1 and q2, evaluated in the context, is
non-empty, returns true; else, returns false.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;q1 and q2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;and&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;(Boolean) If the intersection of q1 and q2, evaluated in the context, is
non-empty, returns true; else, returns false.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;both&quot; operator was introduced because we found that many queries use
filters to express constraints on the same data that is returned outside the
filter, resulting in expressions that are rather redundant. For instance, the
following query uses filters to express that only invoices for the customer
named &quot;Wile E. Coyote&quot;that also contain products are of interest, and both the
customer name and the set of products should be returned: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;//invoice[customer[name='Wile E. Coyote'] and .//product]/(customer | .//product)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &quot;both&quot; operator, this same query can be expressed more
concisely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;//invoice/(customer[name='Wile E. Coyote'] ~ .//product)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the &quot;both&quot; operator is neither the boolean &quot;or&quot; operator nor the
set intersection operator. The expression &quot;customer intersect product&quot; always
returns an emtpy result since no element is ever simultaneously a
&amp;lt;customer&amp;gt; element and a &amp;lt;product&amp;gt; element. The &quot;both&quot; operator is
used to specify conditions which must simultaneously be satisfied for the
context.&lt;/p&gt;

== Grouping Operator ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt; It is often useful to group results using the structure of the original
document. For instance, a query that lists the products on invoices might want
to group products by invoice, placing each group of products within an invoice
tag. XQL provides a grouping operator that provides exactly this functionality.
In the following query, the element to the left of the curly braces (the
Grouping
Element) is used to group the results of the query within the
braces:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;//invoice { .//product }&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For each grouping element matched by the query, the grouping operator
creates an empty element with the same name. The results of the query contained
within the curly braces are then appended to this new node as children. If we
apply this query to the invoice data presented in the tutorial, we obtain these
results:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;xql:result&amp;gt;   
  &amp;lt;invoice&amp;gt;     
    &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;ACME&quot; prod_name=&quot;screwdriver&quot; price=&quot;80.00&quot;/&amp;gt;      
    &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;ACME&quot; prod_name=&quot;power wrench&quot; price=&quot;20.00&quot;/&amp;gt;    
  &amp;lt;/invoice&amp;gt;   
  &amp;lt;invoice&amp;gt;    
    &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;BSA&quot; prod_name=&quot;left-handed smoke shifter&quot; price=&quot;16.00&quot;/&amp;gt;     
    &amp;lt;product maker=&quot;BSA&quot; prod_name=&quot;snipe call&quot; price=&quot;13.00&quot;/&amp;gt;   
  &amp;lt;/invoice&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xql:result&amp;gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex queries that use the grouping operator can be made more readable by
the appropriate use of whitespace, eg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;invoice {
	.//customer[name contains &quot;Coyote&quot;] { 
		name | address
	} ~
   entries {
	   .//product[@maker=&quot;ACME&quot;]
	}	
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

== Sequence ==

 
&lt;p&gt;XQL defines the following operators for sequence:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;before&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;a before b&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Returns a list of all &quot;a&quot;s that precede a &quot;b&quot;.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;after&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;a after b&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Returns a list of all &quot;a&quot;s that occur after a &quot;b&quot;.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;list concatenation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a, b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns a list containing all &quot;a&quot;s, followed by all &quot;b&quot;s. Useful for
specifying order in return lists.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The list concatenation operator is used to specify order in return lists. In
general, XQL operators maintain document order; the concatenation operator
allows an order to be specified within a return list. For instance, the
following query specifies that the order of the returned results should be
author, then title, then isbn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;//book//(author, title, isbn)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is more than one author, all authors will be listed before the
title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In systems where XML is used mainly to represent data from object oriented
systems or relational databases, sequence may not be particularly important.
However, sequence is important in documents, and it also can be useful in
data-oriented applications where the markup does not clearly indicate the role
of each element. Consider the following table, which lists the latest scores
for some fictitious sport:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Western League&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Aardvarks 12&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Weasels 10&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Mosquitos 17&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Slugs 2&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Southern League&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Tortoises 25&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Hares 0&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Platypii 17&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Amoebae 16&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The markup for this table looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;table width=&quot;50%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;emph&amp;gt;Western League&amp;lt;/emph&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;Aardvarks 12&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Weasels 10&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;Mosquitos 17&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Bulls 2&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;emph&amp;gt;Southern League&amp;lt;/emph&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;Tortoises 25&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Hares 0&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td colspan=&quot;1&quot;&amp;gt;Platypii 17&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;Amoebae 16&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Purists may object that this is not particularly good markup, since it does
not clearly distinguish the leagues from the scores. We agree, and when we
write our own documents, we would write them differently; however, there is a
lot of mediocre markup in the real world, and when querying documents, we do
not have the luxury of rewriting them first. Therefore, we feel that a query
language should be able to manage data like that shown above. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To find all the latest scores for the Western League, we can use the
following query:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;table//((tr after (tr contains &quot;Western League&quot;)) before (tr contains &quot;Southern League&quot;))&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt; 
Sequence is handled by axes in XPath. We believe that an XML query
language should provide some means for allowing sequence in queries, and that
various approaches should be considered. The approach discussed here has
advantages in expressing relationships among multiple nodes, especially when
comparisons are to be made only within the descendants of a particular
node. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

== Functions ==
 

&lt;p&gt;Most of the functions of XQL have been taken directly from XSL Pattern
Language. A few functions have been added, many more have been omitted because
we found them to be less relevant in a pure query environment than in a general
purpose transformation environment. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;
Collection functions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;attribute(), attribute('name') &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns the attributes in the context. If a name argument is supplied,
returns the attribute with the given name.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt; comment()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns the comments in the context.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;element(), element('name') &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns the elements in the context. If a name argument is supplied,
returns the elements with the given name.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt; entity-ref()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns the entity references in the context. XQL operates on a view of the
document in which all entity references are expanded; this function is the only
way to locate entity references in XQL.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt; node()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns all nodes in the context.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt; pi(), pi('target') &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns the processing instructions in the context. If a target argument is
supplied, returns the processing instructions with the given target.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;text()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Returns the text nodes in the context. For the sake of text nodes, XQL
assumes that CDATA sections are treated as text, adjacent text nodes are
merged, and entity references are expanded. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;



&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;count()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt; id()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt; idref() &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;position()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

== Extensible Functions ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt;Many XQL implementations are part of a programming environment. In these
environments, it is helpful to allow users to write their own functions, which
may be used in queries. This must be done in a language-independent manner,
since XQL implementations have been done in a variety of languages, including
C++, Java, Haskell, and Perl. To allow user-defined functions to be written,
XQL provides a function called &quot;function()&quot;. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a user wanted to add a function that computes the average for a list
of values. The user could write a function called &quot;average&quot; and call it in an
XQL query like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;average(property//price)&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;User-defined functions are typically written in the language environment of
the XQL implementation; for instance, if the XQL implementation is written in
Java, user-defined functions are generally written as Java functions. All XQL
functions are passed the list of nodes in the current context. If the function
has parameters, these are passed as strings to the XQL function. Typically, the
function will evaluate these parameters as queries against the current context;
for instance, the user code that implements the &quot;average&quot; function might first
execute the query &quot;property//price&quot; for the current context to obtain a set of
&amp;lt;price&amp;gt; elements, then compute the average of these elements.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The result of a function call is also a nodelist. If a single value is to be
returned, such as a string or a number, it should be returned as an element
node of that type:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xql:number&amp;gt; 112,000.47 &amp;lt;/xql:number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The available set of types that may be returned by functions is described in
the section &quot;Query Results and Serialization&quot;, which follows the current
section. If a function is called with the wrong parameters, this may be
communicated by returning an &amp;lt;xql:warning&amp;gt; element in the result:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xql:warning&amp;gt; &quot;average&quot; requires numeric values for the nodes to be averaged &amp;lt;/xql:warning&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt; 
Some vendors have asked that extensible operators be provided as well.
This would be a useful feature; so far, we have not found a clean design for
extensible operators in XQL. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Issue (function-namespace): &lt;/b&gt;
There are differing opinions as to whether namespaces add significant value
as vendors and users add functions to XQL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== References ==
 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt; 
The ideas in this section are exploratory, and have not yet been
incorporated into XQL. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no syntax for dereferencing links in XQL, but this is
clearly needed in many applications. XSL provides the &quot;id()&quot; function, which
returns the element containing a given id. For instance, the following would
evaluate to the node pointed to by an HREF attribute in an &amp;lt;A&amp;gt; element:
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;A/id(@HREF)&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From an XQL perspective, this is actually a kind of join. However, the above
syntax is less complex than the equivalent join syntax:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;A/id[$h = @HREF]/(//*[id=$h])&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We need functionality similar to id(), extending this functionality to
incorporate any kind of link, not just ID/IDREF. Let's create a function called
ref() which returns the node or nodes to which an XPointer or HTML HREF
points&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;A/ref(@HREF)&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One advantage of the join syntax is that it allows the type of the
referenced node to be specified. It may be useful to be able to specify this as
a further parameter to the function. Let's allow the type of the referenced
node to be specified as a second parameter to the function. For instance, the
following will return the referenced node only if it is a 'table&quot; element;
otherwise, it will return null:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;A/ref(@HREF, &quot;table&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It may also be helpful to specify further parameters, e.g. to limit the
scope of the reference to the current document, the local repository, or some
other identifiable scope.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is frequently useful to be able to identify the references to a
particular node from other nodes. For instance, if we are thinking of deleting
something from a document, we may want to know if it is referenced. For this
purpose, it may be useful to introduce another function that returns all nodes
that reference a particular node. If we call this function &quot;backref()&quot;, it
might look like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;A/backref(table[0])&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Issue (ref-scope): &lt;/b&gt;
Backwards references will also need to be scoped somehow, and not all
systems will want to support them, due to implementation overhead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;References can also be used to specify the URLs of documents used in
queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
 
&lt;code&gt;ref(&quot;http://www.amazon.com&quot;)//book[.//title contains &quot;Alhambra&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;

== Joins ==
 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt; 
Joins are a new feature in XQL. The approach to joins discussed in this
section comes largely from Peter Fankhauser of the GMD-IPSI and Harald
Sch&amp;ouml;ning of Software AG. Gerald Huck of the GMD-IPSI has been particularly
helpful in refining the initial model. There is some preliminary implementation
experience with this approach. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In many environments, it is useful to be able to combine information from
multiple sources to create one unified view. For instance, suppose we have a
source of books and a source of reviews:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;book&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;isbn&amp;gt; 84-7169-020-9 &amp;lt;/isbn&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; Tales of the Alhambra &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;author&amp;gt; Washington Irving &amp;lt;/author&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/book&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;review&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;isbn&amp;gt; 84-7169-020-9 &amp;lt;/isbn&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; Tales of the Alhambra &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;reviewer&amp;gt; Ricardo Sanchez &amp;lt;/reviewer&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;comments&amp;gt;
	A romantic and humorous account of the time that
	the author of &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; lived
	in an Arabian palace in Spain.
  &amp;lt;/comments&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/review&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We may want to combine these to create a view of the book that includes the
comments found in reviews:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;book&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;isbn&amp;gt; 84-7169-020-9 &amp;lt;/isbn&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; Tales of the Alhambra &amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;author&amp;gt; Washington Irving &amp;lt;/author&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;review&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;reviewer&amp;gt; Ricardo Sanchez &amp;lt;/reviewer&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;comments&amp;gt;
	      A romantic and humorous account of the time that
	      the author of &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; lived
	      in an Arabian palace in Spain.
     &amp;lt;/comments&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/review&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/book&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This amounts to inserting information from the review into the book. If we
had a database that consisted only of this one book and this one review, we
could obtain the desired result with this query:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;/book {
		isbn | title | author | //review { reviewer | comments }
}&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If we are using a database with many books and many reviews, the above query
would include the whole list of reviews in every single book, not just the
reviews for the book in question. We need some way to restrict our reviews to
those that have the same ISBN number as the book. We will do this by
introducing correlation variables. In the following example, &quot;$i := isbn&quot;
assigns the variable &quot;$i&quot; to the evaluation of isbn in the context of each
book. The expression &quot;//review[isbn=$i]&quot; restricts the reviews to those that
match &quot;$i&quot;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;/book[$i:=isbn] {
	  isbn | title | author | //review[isbn=$i] { reviewer | comments }
}&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt;
Although filters and variable bindings both use square bracket
notation, variable bindings do not filter results. For instance, the
expressions &quot;/book&quot; and &quot;/book[$i:=isbn]&quot; will always return the same set of
books, whether or not any &amp;lt;isbn&amp;gt; elements are present.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variable bindings propogate as new search contexts are created; when a new
context is created, e.g. as the result of a child or descendant operator, it
inherits all variable bindings that are active. This allows bindings declared
high in the document hierarchy to be used for joins performed lower down.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If a correlation variable is bound to a subexpression that evaluates to more
than one result, any value in the list of results will be used as the basis for
a join. To be precise, &quot;list1 relop list2&quot; evaluates to &quot;all e1 in list1 such
that for some e2 in list2, e1 relop e2 is satisfied&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following query returns books whether or not they have an isbn; reviews
are returned only if they have a matching isbn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;/book[$i:=isbn] {
    $i  | title  | author
    | //review[isbn=$i] { reviewer | comments }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ed. Note: &lt;/b&gt;
In this example, it seems intuitive to say that you can't join on null
- a book with no isbn does not match all reviews that have no isbn. On the XQL
mailing list, there is some difference of opinion as to whether it should be
possible to join on null. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In XQL, square brackets are used for three distinct things that can not be
mixed: subscripts, filters, and variable bindings. If you want both a filter
and a variable binding, you must use separate sets of brackets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;/book[isbn][$i:=isbn] {
    $i  | title  | author
    | //review[isbn=$i] { reviewer | comments }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 


== RenamingOperator ==


&lt;p&gt;The nodes in a list may be renamed using the renaming operator &quot;-&amp;gt;&quot;. In
joins, this can be used to reflect a meaningful name that describes the
synthesized result:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;/book[isbn][$i:=isbn] -&amp;gt; BookWithReviews {
    $i  | title  | author
    | //review[isbn=$i] { reviewer | comments }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The renaming operator may also be used to adjust namespaces in query
results. Since renaming changes the name of a node, it also changes the
namespace. For instance, suppose &amp;lt;book&amp;gt; is in the namespace of
&quot;http://www.TwiceSoldTales.com&quot;, and we rename the &amp;lt;book&amp;gt; element to
&amp;lt;livre&amp;gt;: 
&lt;pre&gt;//book-&amp;gt;livre
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can assume that &amp;lt;livre&amp;gt; is not defined in the namespace associated
with &quot;http://www.TwiceSoldTales.com&quot;. Since renaming often creates element
names that do not exist in the original namespace, renaming in XQL does not
keep the namespace of the original node name. This property of the renaming
operator can be used to remove namespaces; for instance, the following query
places &amp;lt;book&amp;gt; elements in the default namespace, regardless of their
original namespace: 
&lt;pre&gt;//book-&amp;gt;book
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New namespace prefixes may be explicitly applied with the rename operator: 
&lt;pre&gt;//book-&amp;gt;a:book
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
 

== Precedence of Operators ==

 
&lt;p&gt;XQL expressions are evaluated from left to right. The following table shows
the precedence of operators in XQL:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;i&gt;Query Operators by Decreasing Precedence&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
 
 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Grouping &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;() &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Filter &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;[] &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Renaming&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Grouping &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;{ }&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Path &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;/&amp;nbsp;// &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Comparison, Assignment&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;=&amp;nbsp;!=&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;=&amp;nbsp;eq&amp;nbsp; ne&amp;nbsp;
lt&amp;nbsp; le gt ge contains ieq ine ilt ile igt ige icontains&amp;nbsp;:=&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Intersection &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;intersect &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Union &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;union | &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Negation &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;not()&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Conjunction &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;and &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Disjunction &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;or &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Sequence &lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;before after&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;End of Statement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Parentheses may be used for grouping:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;(author | editor)/name&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;author | (editor/name)&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

== Query Results and Serialization ==
 
 
&lt;p&gt;In some environments, the results of a query are returned as XML text. XQL
defines a serialization format to allow the results of queries to be returned
as well-formed XML documents. Namespaces are used to distinguish tags belonging
to the serialization format from tags returned by the query. When query results
are serialized, they are wrapped in an &amp;lt;xql:result&amp;gt; element:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;xql:result xmlns:xql=&quot;http://www.metalab.unc/xql/serialization&quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;customer&amp;gt; Wile E. Coyote, Death Valley, CA &amp;lt;/customer&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;customer&amp;gt; Camp Mertz &amp;lt;/customer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/xql:result&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that a well-formed XML document may have only one
root element, and queries may return any number of results. Other XQL
serialization elements are used to return values from functions, provide
additional information about a query, or indicate errors or warnings. The
following elements are defined in the XQL serialization namespace:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:result&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Surrounds the serialized results of the query.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:query&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Optional. Contains the original query string. Useful for debugging.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:true&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Returned by boolean functions.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:false&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Returned by boolean functions.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:number&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Returned by numeric functions.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:text&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Returned by text functions.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:attribute name=&quot;attributeName&quot; value=&quot;attributeValue&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Used to return attributes when they are returned outside of the attribute
list of an element.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:declaration&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Used to return the XML declaration when it is returned in a query.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:error&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Used to indicate an error in the query. The content of this element
explains the error.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr align=&quot;&quot; valign=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;xql:warning&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt;Used to indicate a warning. The content of this element explains the
warning.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;/tr&gt; 

&lt;/table&gt;

==Where does the TI 86 fit in?==
Where does the TI-86 fit into this? All the info about applicability to different versions skip any mention of the TI-86 which is confusing. -Brentt [[Special:Contributions/75.83.67.181|75.83.67.181]] ([[User talk:75.83.67.181|talk]]) 19:35, 27 September 2008 (UTC)

:Most Likely it's due to the fact that the TI-86 isn't as popular as the TI-83/84 and the TI-89.  I don't know anything about the TI-86, but I would assume that they are completely different. --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] ([[User talk:Jimmyatic|talk]]) 00:22, 24 October 2008 (UTC)

==Removed &quot;old&quot; notice==
Previously, there was a notice at the top of this page stating, &quot;This is the ''old'' discussion page, about the ''old'' [[Programming:TI-Basic]].  All further edits/talks should be made at the new [[TI-Basic 84 Programming]].&quot; However, this book has more information than TI-Basic 84 Programming. Either the information was incompletely moved, or people have continued to edit this book. Both projects are not very active. I believe this book should continue to be developed for two reasons. First, the name TI-84 Basic Programming is too specific. The TI-84 uses the TI Basic Z80 version of the language, as well as the TI-83. I do acknowledge, however, that the name &quot;TI-Basic 84&quot; will catch more hits versus TI Basic Z80 on a list. However, the search suggestions only reluctantly list the TI-Basic 84 project,. Second, and as I mentioned before, the TI Basic Z80 project has more information. In any case, I have added &quot;see also&quot; links to both pages, to ensure readers briefly examine both resources. I do think that the cover page of the TI-Basic 84 project looks nicer and is more organized. Good night.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;La blid vekisa per choko, talim subiti e severi ke si Dorothy non liad sur li moli lite la povud ha bli nosa. Kom esed, li skuso fad la ye halta pokitem spira e ye questiona se quu had eventa; e Toto posid sen koldi, mikri nase en lan fasie e ploretad malim. Dorothy sideskad rekti e observeskad ke li hause non movad; anke non esed sinlumosi, den li sune-brilio inveni tra li fenestre, lumisant li mikri chambre. La saltad fro sur sen lite e kun Toto an sen talones kursed e apertad li porte.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li mikri puera kriad surprisat e regardad sirk la, sen okules kreskant plu e plu grandi pro li marvelosi vidatus kel la vidad.

[[File:Munchkins.png|200px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li siklone had subplasa li hause tre dolsim – relat siklone – mid lande de marvelosi beleso. Esed amindi areas de verdosi gasone an omni flanke, kun majestosi arbres portant richi e saporosi fruktes. Multi belisi flores esed an omni flanke, e fogles kun rari e brilianti plumaje kantad e voletad in li arbres e arbustes. Pokim for esed mikri riverete,  torentant e sintiletant inter verdi rives, e sursurant per voise tre gratitudisant a mikri puera kel had lojia talim longitem sur li siki, grisi stepes.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Durant ke la stead regardant voluntim li stranji e beli vidatus, la observeskad venienti vers la grupe del maxim stranji homes kel la had irgitem unque vida. Les non esed tam grandi kam li kreskat homes kun kel la had sempre es familiari; ma anke les non esed tre mikri. Faktim, les semblad sirk tam alti kam Dorothy, kel esed bonim kreskat puere relat sen aje, quankam les esed, segun lesen aspektos, multi yares plu oldi.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tri ek les esed viros e un esed fema, e omnes esed stranjim vestat. Les portat rondi chapeles kel vadad supru a mikri punte ye un pede super lesen kapes, kun mikri kloches sirk li bordes kel klochetad dolsim durant ke les movad. Li chapeles del viros esed blui; li mikri feman chapele esed blanki, e la portad blanki robe kel pendad kom faldes fro lan shultres. Super lu esed arosat mikri astres kel sintileskad in li sune kom diamantes. Li viros esed vestat in blue, del sami kolore kam sen chapeles, e portad bonim polit butes kun profundi rule de blue an li kulmines. Li viros, Dorothy pensad, esed sirk tam oldi kam Onklo Henry, den du ek les haved barbes. Ma li mikri fema esed sinduto multi plu oldi. Lan fasie esed kovrat per sulkes, lasen hares esed preske blanki, e la marchad kelkigrad rigidim.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Kand disi homes proximeskad li hause vor Dorothy stead in li porte, les pausad e chuchotad a mutu, quasi pavorosi ye veni plusim. Ma li mikri, oldi fema marchad til Dorothy, flekted basim e dikted, kun dolsi voise:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Vu es bonvenit, maxim nobli Sorsiera, al lande del munchkines. Nus es talim gratitudosi a vu pro havant tua li Mali Sorsiera del Este, e pro liberisant nusen popule fro sklaviro.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dorothy askoltad disi diktione surprisat. Quu li mikri fema volid dikte per noma la sorsiera, e per dikte ke la had tua li Mali Sorsiera del Este? Dorothy esed inosenti, non-nosiv, mikri puera, kel had bli porta per siklone a multi mailes fro sen heme; e la had nulitem tua ule durant sen toti vivo.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ma li mikri fema evidentim expektad lan responso; dunke Dorothy dikted, sin hesito, ”Vu es tre kordial, ma mus es erore. Me non ha tua ule.“

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Vun hause ha, qualim unque,“ li mikri oldi fema repliked, kun rido, “e tu es li sami kose. Vida!“ la kontinuad, indikant al angule del hause. “Dar es lan du pedes, ankore saliant fro sub bloke de ligne.“
[[Image:Wizoz_feet.png|none|left]]
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dorothy regardad, e krietad pro timo. Dar, verim, presisim sub li angule del grandi trave sur kel li hause stead, du pedes saliad, shuad in arjenti shues kun puntisat pede-fingres.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Ho ve! Ho ve!” Dorothy kriad, tenant sen manus kunu konsternatim. ”Li hause mus ha fala a sur la. Quu nus sal fa?”

”Nulu es faenda”, li mikri fema dikted kalmim.

”Ma que la esed?” Dorothy questionad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“La esed li Mali Sorsiera del Este, kom me ha dikte,” li mikri fema responsad. ”La ha tena omni li munchkines in sklaviro durant multi yares, forsant les sklavira por la noktim e jornim. Nun les omni es liberisat, e es gratitudosi a vu pro li favore.”

“Que li munchkines es?“, Dorothy questionad.

“Les es li popule kel habita dis lande del Este vor li Mali Sorsiera regnad.”

“Ob vu es munchkine?” Dorothy questionad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“No, ma me es lesen amike, quamkam me habita li lande del Norde. Kand les vidad kel Sorsiera del Este esed morit li munchkines sendad rapidi masajere a me, e me venid instantim. Me es li Sorsiera del Norde.“

“Ho, gratiosi!“ Dorothy kriad. “Ob vu es reali sorsiera?”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Yes, verim,“ li mikri fema responsad. “Ma me es bon sorsiera, e li popule ama me. Me non es tam potenti kam esed li Mali Sorsiera kel regnad hir, si talim me self vud ha liberisa li popule.”

“Ma me kredad ke omni sorsieras esed mali,” dikted li puera, kel esed mi-pavorisat fasiant real sorsiera.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Ho, no, tu es grandi erore. Esed nur quar sorsieras in omni li Lande de Oz, e du ek las, tas kel lojia in li Norde e li Sude, es bon sorsieras. Me sava ke dis es veri, den me self es un ek las, e non pove erora. Tas kel lojiad in li Este e li Weste esed, ya, mali sorsieras; ma nun pro ke vu ha tua un ek las, es nur un Mali Sorsiera in omni li Lande de Oz – ta kel lojia in li Weste.“

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Ma,“ Dorothy dikted after penso durant un momente,“Tanta Em ha dikte a me ke omni li sorsieras esed morit – yares e yares ante nun.“

“Que es Tanta Em?“, questionad li mikri oldi fema.

“La es men tanta kel lojia in Kansas, fro vor me venid.”

[[File:Wizoz_munch.png|150px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li Sorsiera del Norde semblad pensa durant kelki tempe, kun sen kape sube e sen okules vers li tere. Tand la regardeskad supru e dikted, ”Me non sava vor Kansas es, den me nulitem ante audid ti lande ye bli mentiona. Ma dikte a me, ob lu es sivilisat lande?”

”Ho, yes,” Dorothy respondad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”Dunke tu explika lu. In sivilisat landes me kreda ke es nuli restanti sorsieras, ni sorsieros, ni magas, ni magos. Ma, komprenda, li Lande de Oz nulitem ha es sivilisat, pro ke nus es separat fro omni li seteri monde. Pro tu nus ankore have sorsieras e sorsieros inter nus.“

“Que es li sorsieros?” Dorothy questionad.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Oz self es li Grandi Sorsiero,” li Sorsiera respondad, basifikant sen voise a susuro. “Lo es plu potenti kam omni seteri nus kombinat. Lo lojia in li Urbe de Smeraldes.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dorothy saled questiona altri questione, ma jus tand li munchkines, kel had proximu stea silentiosim, klamad lautim e indikad vers li angule del hause vor li Mali Sorsiera had lia.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Quu es?” li mikri oldi fema questionad, e regardad, e komensad rida. Li pedes del morit Sorsiera had totim desaperi, e nulu restad exept li arjenti shues.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;”La esed talim oldi,” li Sorsiera del Norde explikad, ke la parsikeskad rapidim sub li sune. Tu es li fine de la. Ma li arjente shues es vun, e vu sal have lus por porta.” La moved sen manu subu e prendad supru li shues, e after skusa li polve ek lus donad lus a Dorothy.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Li Sorsiera del Este esed fieri ye ti arjenti shues,” un ek li munchkines dikted, “e es kelki sorsio relat lus; ma quu lu es nus nulitem savad.”

Dorothy portad li shues en li hause e plasad lus sur li table. Tand la riveni eku al munchkines e dikted:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Me pavoreta e voli retrovada a men tanta e onklo, pro ke me es serti ke les sal pavoreta pri me. Ob vu pove helpa me trova men vie?”

Li munchkines e li Sorsiera regardad mutu, e tand Dorothy, e tand osilifikad sen kapes.

“In li Este, non ferni fro hir,” dikted un, “es grandi desertu, e nule povud vado trans lu e viva.“ 

“Es sami in li Sude,“ altre dikted, “den me ha es dar e vida lu.“ Li Sude es li lande del quadlinges.“

[[File:Dorothy Gale with silver shoes.jpg|200px]]

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“On ha dikte,“ li triesmi home dikted, &quot;ke es sami in li Weste. E ti lande, vor li Winkies lojia, es regnat dal Mali Sorsiera del Weste, kel vud fa vu sen sklave si vu vada lan vie.“

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Li Norde es men heme,“ li oldi siniora dikted, &quot;e an sen borde es li sami grandi desertu kel sirkumda disi Lande de Oz. Me regreta, men kara, ke vu sal mus lojia che nus.“

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dorothy komensad ploreta pro disu, den la sentid solitari inter dis omni stranji homes. Lan lakrimes semblad chagrina li kordial munchkines den les instantim ekprendad sen nase-tukes e komensad plora anke. Pri li mikri oldi fema, la froprendad sen bonete e balansad li punte sur li kulmine de sen nase, durant ke la kontad ”Un, du, tri” kun soleni voise. Instantim li bonete chanjad en plake de ardese, sur kel esed skriptet kom grandi, blanki literes de krete:

”LET DOROTHY VADA AL URBE DE SMERALDES”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Li mikri oldi fema prendad li plake fro sen nase, e hant lekte li vordes sur lu, questionad, ”Ob vun nome es Dorothy, men kara?”

&quot;Yes,&quot; li puere respondad, regardant supru e sikisant sen lakrimes.

&quot;Dunke vu mus vada al Urbe de Smeraldes. Tamen Oz sal helpa vu.&quot;

&quot;Vor es li urbe?&quot; Dorothy questionad.

&quot;Lu es exaktim mid li lande, e es regnat da Oz, li Grandi Sorsiero pri kel me ha dikte a vu.&quot;

&quot;Ob lo es bon viro?&quot; li puere questionad pavoretosim.

&quot;Lo es bon Sorsiero. Ob lo es viro o non me non pove dikte, den me nulitem ha vida lo.&quot;

&quot;Qualim me pove ariva dar?&quot; Dorothy questionad.

&quot;Vu mus marcha. Lu es longi voyaje, tra lande kel es kelkitem plesanti e kelkitem deslumosi e horosiv. Tamen, me sal usa omni magi artes kel me sava por protekte vu.&quot;

&quot;Ob vu non sal vada kun me?&quot; pledad li puera, kel had komensa vida li mikri, oldi fema kom sen soli amike.

&quot;No, me non pove fa lu,&quot; la respondad, &quot;ma me sal dona a vu men basio, e nule sal osa nosa persone kel ha bli basia dal Sorsiera del Norde.&quot;

La proximeskad Dorothy e basiad la dolsim sur li fronte. Vor lan labies tuchad li puera les restisad rondi, briliant marke, kom Dorothy deskovrad bald aftru.

&quot;Li vie al Urbe de Smeraldes es pavat per gelbi brike,&quot; li Sorsiera dikted, &quot;dunke vu non pove misa lu. Kand vu sal ariva a Oz non tima lo, ma dikte vun rakonte e prega ke lo helpa vu. Adie, men kara.&quot;

= Introduction =

XML encryption was developed to address two common areas not addressed by the Transport Layer Security and Secure Socket Layer protocol (TLS/SSL).  TLS/SSL is a very secure and reliable protocol that provides end-to-end security sessions between two parties.  XML adds an extra layer of security to TLS/SSL by encrypting part or all of the data being exchanged and by allowing for secure sessions between more than two parties.  In other words, each party can maintain secure or insecure sessions with any of the communicating parties, and both secure and non-secure data can be exchanged in the same document.  Furthermore, XML encryption can handle both XML and non-XML (e.g. binary) data.

= Encryption Syntax =
All XML encrypted files must start with the following XML preamble, declaration, internal entity, and import.

 Schema Definition:
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE schema  PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XMLSchema 200102//EN&quot;
   &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.dtd&quot;

     &lt;!ENTITY xenc 'http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#'&gt;
     &lt;!ENTITY % p ''&gt;
     &lt;!ENTITY % s ''&gt;

  &lt;schema xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' version='1.0'
          xmlns:ds='http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#'
          xmlns:xenc='http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#'
          targetNamespace='http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#'
          elementFormDefault='qualified'&gt;
    &lt;import namespace='http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#'
            schemaLocation='http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/xmldsig-core-   schema.xsd'/&gt;


== EncryptedType Element ==
'''EncryptedType''' is the abstract type from which EncryptedData and EncryptedKey are derived.

  Schema Definition:
   &lt;complexType name='EncryptedType' abstract='true'&gt;
    &lt;sequence&gt;
      &lt;element name='EncryptionMethod' type='xenc:EncryptionMethodType' 
               minOccurs='0'/&gt;
      &lt;element ref='ds:KeyInfo' minOccurs='0'/&gt;
      &lt;element ref='xenc:CipherData'/&gt;
      &lt;element ref='xenc:EncryptionProperties' minOccurs='0'/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
    &lt;attribute name='Id' type='ID' use='optional'/&gt;
    &lt;attribute name='Type' type='anyURI' use='optional'/&gt;
    &lt;attribute name='MimeType' type='string' use='optional'/&gt;
    &lt;attribute name='Encoding' type='anyURI' use='optional'/&gt; 
   &lt;/complexType&gt;

'''Syntax Explanation'''

'''EncryptionMethod''' is an optional element that describes the encryption algorithm applied to the cipher data. If the element is absent, the encryption algorithm must be known by the recipient or the decryption will fail.
 &lt;element name='EncryptionMethod' type='xenc:EncryptionMethodType' 
               minOccurs='0'/&gt;

'''ds:KeyInfo''' is an optional element that carries information about the key used to encrypt the data. Subsequent sections of this specification define new elements that may appear as children of ds:KeyInfo.
 &lt;element ref='ds:KeyInfo' minOccurs='0'/&gt;


'''CipherData''' is a mandatory element that contains the CipherValue or CipherReference with the encrypted data.
 &lt;element ref='xenc:CipherData'/&gt;

'''EncryptionProperties''' can contain additional information concerning the generation of the EncryptedType (e.g., date/time stamp).
 &lt;element ref='xenc:EncryptionProperties' minOccurs='0'/&gt;

'''Id''' is an optional attribute providing for the standard method of assigning a string id to the element within the document context.
 &lt;attribute name='Id' type='ID' use='optional'/&gt;


'''Type''' is an optional attribute identifying type information about the plaintext form of the encrypted content. While optional, this specification takes advantage of it for mandatory processing in dycryption. If the EncryptedData element contains data of Type 'element' or element 'content', and replaces that data in an XML document context, it is strongly recommended the Type attribute be provided. Without this information, the decryptor will be unable to automatically restore the XML document to its original cleartext form.
 &lt;attribute name='Type' type='anyURI' use='optional'/&gt;

'''MimeType''' is an optional (advisory) attribute which describes the media type of the data which has been encrypted. The value of this attribute is a string with values defined by [MIME]. For example, if the data that is encrypted is a base64 encoded PNG, the transfer Encoding may be specified as 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#base64' and the MimeType as 'image/png'. This attribute is purely advisory; no validation of the MimeType information is required and it does not indicate the encryption application must do any additional processing. Note, this information may not be necessary if it is already bound to the identifier in the Type attribute. For example, the Element and Content types defined in this specification are always UTF-8 encoded text.
 &lt;attribute name='MimeType' type='string' use='optional'/&gt;

== EncryptionMethod Element ==
'''EncryptionMethod''' is an optional element that describes the encryption algorithm applied to the cipher data. If the element is absent, the encryption algorithm must be known by the recipient or the decryption will fail. The permitted child elements of the EncryptionMethod are determined by the specific value of the Algorithm attribute URI.

 Schema Definition:
  &lt;complexType name='EncryptionMethodType' mixed='true'&gt;
    &lt;sequence&gt;
      &lt;element name='KeySize' minOccurs='0' type='xenc:KeySizeType'/&gt;
      &lt;element name='OAEPparams' minOccurs='0' type='base64Binary'/&gt;
      &lt;any namespace='##other' minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='unbounded'/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
    &lt;attribute name='Algorithm' type='anyURI' use='required'/&gt;
  &lt;/complexType&gt;

== CipherData Element ==
'''CipherData''' is a mandatory element that provides the encrypted data. It must either contain the encrypted octet sequence as base64 encoded text of the CipherValue element, or provide a reference to an external location containing the encrypted octet sequence via the CipherReference element.

 Schema Definition:
  &lt;element name='CipherData' type='xenc:CipherDataType'/&gt;
  &lt;complexType name='CipherDataType'&gt;
     &lt;choice&gt;
       &lt;element name='CipherValue' type='base64Binary'/&gt;
       &lt;element ref='xenc:CipherReference'/&gt;
     &lt;/choice&gt;
   &lt;/complexType&gt;

== CipherReference Element == 
'''CipherReference''' identifies a source which, when processed, yields the encrypted octet sequence CipherReference is used when CipherValue is not supplied directly. The actual value is obtained as follows. The CipherReference URI contains an identifier that is dereferenced. Should the CipherReference element contain an OPTIONAL sequence of Transforms, the data resulting from dereferencing the URI is transformed as specified so as to yield the intended cipher value. For example, if the value is base64 encoded within an XML document; the transforms could specify an XPath expression followed by a base64 decoding so as to extract the octets.

 Schema Definition:
  &lt;element name='CipherReference' type='xenc:CipherReferenceType'/&gt;
   &lt;complexType name='CipherReferenceType'&gt;
       &lt;sequence&gt;
         &lt;element name='Transforms' type='xenc:TransformsType' minOccurs='0'/&gt;
       &lt;/sequence&gt;
       &lt;attribute name='URI' type='anyURI' use='required'/&gt;
   &lt;/complexType&gt;

    &lt;complexType name='TransformsType'&gt;
       &lt;sequence&gt;
         &lt;element ref='ds:Transform' maxOccurs='unbounded'/&gt; 
       &lt;/sequence&gt;
     &lt;/complexType&gt;

'''Cipher Reference with Optional Tranform feature and Tranform Algorithm:'''

 &lt;CipherReference URI=&quot;http://www.example.com/CipherValues.xml&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Transforms&gt;
      &lt;ds:Transform 
       Algorithm=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116&quot;&gt;
          &lt;ds:XPath xmlns:rep=&quot;http://www.example.org/repository&quot;&gt;
            self::text()[parent::rep:CipherValue[@Id=&quot;example1&quot;]]
          &lt;/ds:XPath&gt;
      &lt;/ds:Transform&gt;
      &lt;ds:Transform Algorithm=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#base64&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/Transforms&gt;
  &lt;/CipherReference&gt;

== EncryptedData Element ==
'''EncryptedData''' is the core element in the syntax. Not only does its CipherData child contain the encrypted data, but it's also the element that replaces the encrypted element, or serves as the new document root.

 Schema Definition:
  &lt;element name='EncryptedData' type='xenc:EncryptedDataType'/&gt;
  &lt;complexType name='EncryptedDataType'&gt;
    &lt;complexContent&gt;
     &lt;extension base='xenc:EncryptedType'&gt;
     &lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;/complexContent&gt;
  &lt;/complexType&gt;

== Exchanger XML Lite ==
Cladonia offers an xml editor at http://www.exchangerxml.com/ for free noncommercial use, and can be downloaded without registration.

This is a Java-based product that runs on all platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OSX and UNIX.  

(NOTE: If you need an XML editor for commercial use, you can get a free 30-day trial of Exchanger XML Professional at http://www.exchangerxml.com)

== Single Entity in Exchanger XML Lite ==

The following directions will lead you step-by-step through doing the same project that is found in the 
[[../A single entity]] chapter.

== Part One: Creating the Project Folder ==

1) Open Exchanger XML Lite

2) Click on: 
            -Project
             -New Project : a &quot;New Project&quot; folder will appear 
                                 in the project folder window
3) Type &quot;TourGuide&quot; over the &quot;New Project&quot; title to change the name of the new project to TourGuide.

[[Image:exchange2.png]]

== Part Two: Creating the Schema File ==

1) Click on: 
            -File
             -New 
              -For Type
               -Scroll to &quot;XML Schema Definition&quot; and highlight it
                -OK
2)Exchanger automatically puts the beginning and ending tags in the file for you, however, for our example, delete those automatic tags, and copy and paste the following code into the file:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;!-- Tour Guide --&gt;
    &lt;!--The tourGuide element is defined as a complex element type, i.e. 
        it has embedded elements.--&gt; 
    &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
                &lt;!--The minimum number of times an element can occur is 
                 set using minOccurs (default is 1) and an unlimited 
                number of times an element can occur maxOccurs=”unbounded”.--&gt;
                &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;city&quot; type=&quot;cityDetails&quot; minOccurs = &quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
        &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:element&gt;
     &lt;!-- City --&gt;
     &lt;!--City is declared an element of named complex type --&gt;
     &lt;!--&lt;xsd:complexType begins the declaration of a complex  
type, ”cityDetails” identifies the complex type. 
     This is NOT the name of the element. This complex type 
     definition may be used in the declarations of more than one element.--&gt;
     &lt;xsd:complexType name=&quot;cityDetails&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--Schema element sequence {13} specifies that the child elements 
        must appear in the order specified.--&gt;
        &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
             &lt;!--&lt;xsd:element begins the declaration of an element of simple 
             type. ”cityName” is the name of the element being declared (in 
             the XML document it will look something like: &lt;cityName&gt; ) 
             and ”xsd:string” is the data type of the element.--&gt; 
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;cityName&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;adminUnit&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;country&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;population&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;area&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;elevation&quot; type=&quot;xsd:integer&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;longitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;latitude&quot; type=&quot;xsd:decimal&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;description&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;history&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;!--Closing of tags. Note: these should not overlap.--&gt; 
         &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
     &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:schema&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

3) Click on the GREEN CHECK to Validate, and the BROWN CHECK to check
for Well-Formedness.  These can be found on the toolbar:

4)Click on:
     -File
      -Save
       -&quot;city.xsd&quot;
5)Right Click on:
      -&quot;TourGuide&quot; project folder
        -Add File
         -click on &quot;city.xsd&quot;
          -open
       
   (Note: Now the project &quot;TourGuide&quot; should contain one file,
         &quot;city.xsd&quot;.)

== Part Three: Creating the Style Sheet ==
1)Click on:
     -File
      -New
       -For Type
        -Scroll to &quot;XML StyleSheet Language&quot; and highlight it
         -OK
2)Delete any automatic tags that appear, and cut and paste the following code into the file:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;!--&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt; declares start of stylesheet and identifies the version 
     number and the official W3C namespace.--&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;!--&lt;xsl:template&gt; defines the start of a template and contains 
    rules to apply when a specified node is matched. The match attribute is 
    used to associate (match) the template with an XML element, in this case 
    the root (/), or whole branch, of the XML source document. The XSL looks 
    for the root match and then outputs the HTML.--&gt; 
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--The contents of the template element are placed in the output 
         stream of HTML that the browser will be able to interpret.--&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Tour Guide&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
               &lt;h2&gt;Cities&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;tourGuide&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;tourGuide&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;city&quot;&gt;
            &lt;xsl:text&gt;City: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
                &lt;!--&lt;xsl:value-of&gt; extracts the value of the selected 
                node/XML element and adds it to the output stream--&gt;
                &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;cityName&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;xsl:text&gt;Population: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
                &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;population&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;xsl:text&gt;Country: &lt;/xsl:text&gt;
                &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;country&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
    &lt;!--&lt;xsl:for-each&gt; can be used to loop through each node in a specified 
         node set and add them to the output--&gt;     
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

3) Click on the GREEN CHECK to Validate, and the BROWN CHECK to check for Well-Formedness.
(NOTE:  Be sure to eliminate any &quot;white space&quot; before the text that you paste, or you may have an error when validating.)

4)Click on:
      -File
       -Save As
        -&quot;city.xsl&quot;
5)Right Click on:
      -&quot;TourGuide&quot; project folder
       -Add File
        -&quot;city.xsl&quot;
          -open

      (Note: Now the project &quot;TourGuide&quot; contains two files, 
       &quot;city.xsd&quot;, and &quot;city.xsl&quot;.)

[[File:1|thumhttp://xpressvds.blogspot.com/bnail]]
== Part Four: Creating the XML File ==

1) Click on:
    -File
     -New
      -Default XML Document
       -OK
2) Delete any automatic tags that appear and copy and paste the following code:
  &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;city.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;

&lt;!--The following declaration identifies the root element of the document 
(tourGuide) and the schema file (city.xsd) using xsi=schemaLocation--&gt;
&lt;tourGuide&gt;
    xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'
    xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation='city.xsd'&gt;
    &lt;!--The definition of the first city--&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
        &lt;cityName&gt;Belmopan&lt;/cityName&gt;
        &lt;adminUnit&gt;Cayo&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
        &lt;country&gt;Belize&lt;/country&gt;
        &lt;population&gt;11100&lt;/population&gt;
        &lt;area&gt;5&lt;/area&gt;
        &lt;elevation&gt;130&lt;/elevation&gt;
        &lt;longitude&gt;88.44&lt;/longitude&gt;
        &lt;latitude&gt;17.27&lt;/latitude&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Belmopan is the capital of Belize&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;history&gt;Belmopan was established following the devastation of the
           former capitol, Belize City, by Hurricane Hattie in 1965. High 
           ground and open space influenced the choice and ground-breaking 
           began in 1966.  By 1970 most government offices and operations had 
           already moved to the new location.
        &lt;/history&gt;
    &lt;/city&gt;
    &lt;!--the definition of the second city--&gt;
    &lt;city&gt;
        &lt;cityName&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/cityName&gt;
        &lt;adminUnit&gt;Selangor&lt;/adminUnit&gt;
        &lt;country&gt;Malaysia&lt;/country&gt;
        &lt;population&gt;1448600&lt;/population&gt;
        &lt;area&gt;243&lt;/area&gt;
        &lt;elevation&gt;111&lt;/elevation&gt;
        &lt;longitude&gt;101.71&lt;/longitude&gt;
        &lt;latitude&gt;3.16&lt;/latitude&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Kuala Lumpur is the capital of Malaysia and the largest 
            city in the nation&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;history&gt;The city was founded in 1857 by Chinese tin miners and  
            perseded Klang.  In 1880 the British government transferred their 
            headquarters from Klang to Kuala Lumpur, and in 1896 it became the 
            capital of Malaysia. 
        &lt;/history&gt;
    &lt;/city&gt;
&lt;!--The closing of the root element tag--&gt;    
&lt;/tourGuide&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

3) Click on the GREEN CHECK to Validate, and the BROWN CHECK to check for Well-Formedness. 
(NOTE:  Be sure to eliminate any &quot;white space&quot; before the text that you paste, or you may have an error when validating.)

== What Is XForms? ==

Forms are an important part of many web applications today. An HTML form makes it possible for web applications to accept input from a user.  Web users now do complex transactions that are starting to exceed the limitations of standard HTML forms.  XForms is the next generation of HTML forms and is richer and more flexible than HTML forms. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
XForms uses XML for data definition and HTML or XHTML for data display. XForms separates the data logic of a form from its presentation.   Separating data from presentation makes XForms device independent, because the data model can be used for all devices. The presentation can be customized for different user interfaces, like mobile phones and handheld devices and can provide interactivity between such devices.  It is also possible to add XForms elements directly into other XML applications like VoiceXML (speaking web data), WML (Wireless Markup Language), and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

== The Purpose of XForms ==
XForms is the separation of purpose from presentation. For example, the purpose of a questionnaire application is to collect information about the user. This is done by creating a presentation that allows the user to provide the required information. Web applications typically render such a presentation as an interactive document that is continuously updated during user interaction. By separating the purpose from its presentation, XForms enables the binding of different interactions to a single model.
&lt;br&gt;

== The Main Aspects of XForms ==
The '''XForms model''' defines what the form is, what data it contains, and what it should do.
The '''XForms user interface''' defines the input fields and how they should be displayed.
The '''XForms Submit Protocol''' defines how XForms send and receive data, including the ability to suspend and resume the completion of a form.
'''XForms is &quot;instance data&quot;''', an internal representation of the data mapped to the familiar &quot;form controls&quot;. Instance data is based on XML and defined in terms of XPath’s internal tree representation and processing of XML
&lt;br&gt;

== The XForms Framework ==

With XForms, input data is described in two different parts:
# XForm model &lt;br&gt;
# XForm user interface&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

=== The XForms Model ===
The XForm model defines what the form is, what data it contains, and what it should do.&lt;br&gt;

The data model is an instance (a template) of an XML document.
The XForms model defines a data model inside a &lt;model&gt; element: 
&lt;br&gt;
 
  &lt;model&gt;
  &lt;instance&gt;
    &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;fname/&gt;
      &lt;lname/&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
  &lt;/instance&gt;
  &lt;submission id=&quot;form1&quot; action=&quot;submit.asp&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/model&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

From the example above, you can see that the XForms model uses an &lt;instance&gt; element to define the XML template for data to be collected, and a &lt;submission&gt; element to describe how to submit the data.&lt;br&gt;

The XForms model does not say anything about the visual part of the form (the user interface).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
====The &lt;instance&gt; Element====
The data collected by XForms is expressed as XML instance data. XForms is always collecting data for an XML document. The &lt;instance&gt; element in the XForms model defines the XML document.&lt;br&gt;

In the example above the &quot;data instance&quot; (the XML document) the form is collecting data for looks like this:
  &lt;person&gt;
    &lt;fname/&gt;
    &lt;lname/&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;
After collecting the data, the XML document might look like this:
  &lt;person&gt;
    &lt;fname&gt;Jim&lt;/fname&gt;
    &lt;lname&gt;Jones&lt;/lname&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

====The &lt;submission&gt; Element====
The XForms model uses  a &lt;submission&gt; element to describe how to submit the data.  The &lt;submission&gt; element defines a form and how it should be submitted. In the example above, the id=&quot;form1&quot; attribute identifies the form, the action=&quot;submit.asp&quot; attribute defines the URL to where the form should be submitted, and the method=&quot;get&quot; attribute defines the method to use when submitting the data.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The following diagram shows how the XForm model has the capability to work with a variety of user interfaces.

===The XForms User Interface===
The XForms user interface is used to display and input the data.  The user interface elements of XForms are called controls (or input controls):
  &lt;input ref=&quot;fname&quot;&gt;&lt;label&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;input ref=&quot;lname&quot;&gt;&lt;label&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;submit submission=&quot;form1&quot;&gt;&lt;label&gt;Submit&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/submit&gt;
In the example above the two &lt;input&gt; elements define two input fields. The ref=&quot;fname&quot; and ref=&quot;lname&quot; attributes point to the &lt;fname&gt; and &lt;lname&gt; elements in the XForms model.  The &lt;submit&gt; element has a submission=&quot;form1&quot; attribute which refers to the &lt;submission&gt; element in the XForms model. A submit element is usually displayed as a button.  Notice the &lt;label&gt; elements in the example.  With XForms every input control element has a required &lt;label&gt; element.
&lt;br&gt;
==Putting Everything Together==
XForms has to run inside another XML document. It could run inside XHTML 1.0, and it will run inside XHTML 2.0.  If we put it all together, the document will look like this:
  &lt;xforms&gt;
  &lt;model&gt;
  &lt;instance&gt;
    &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;fname/&gt;
      &lt;lname/&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
  &lt;/instance&gt;
  &lt;submission id=&quot;form1&quot; action=&quot;submit.asp&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/model&gt;
  &lt;input ref=&quot;fname&quot;&gt;&lt;label&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;input ref=&quot;lname&quot;&gt;&lt;label&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
  &lt;submit submission=&quot;form1&quot;&gt;&lt;label&gt;Submit&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/submit&gt;
  &lt;/xforms&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

==The XForms Processor==
An XForms Processor built into the browser will be responsible for submitting the XForms data to a target.  The data can be submitted as XML and could look something like this:

  &lt;person&gt;
    &lt;fname&gt;Jim&lt;/fname&gt;
    &lt;lname&gt;Jones&lt;/lname&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;

Or it can be submitted as text, looking something like this:
  fname=Jim;lname=Jones

&lt;br&gt;

==The XForms Namespace==
The official namespace for XForms is: http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms.  If you want to use XForms in HTML (or XHTML 1.0), you should declare all XForms elements with an XForms namespace.  XForms is expected to be a standard part of XHTML 2.0, eliminating the need for the XForms namespace.

 
==An XForms Example==
Take a look at this document using XForms:
  &lt;xforms&gt;
  &lt;model&gt;
    &lt;instance&gt;
    &lt;person&gt;
      &lt;fname/&gt;
      &lt;lname/&gt;
    &lt;/person&gt;
    &lt;/instance&gt;
    &lt;submission id=&quot;form1&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;submit.asp&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/model&gt;
  &lt;input ref=&quot;fname&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;input ref=&quot;lname&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;submit submission=&quot;form1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Submit&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/submit&gt;
  &lt;/xforms&gt;

== The Form Controls ==
The components of the form that deal with data entry and display are referred to as the form controls or user interface controls. XForms defines a comprehensive set of device-neutral, platform-independent form controls. For each element of data defined in the model, a form control defines its appearance via the client. These controls can be combined with stylesheets to provide sophisticated form displays.
         	                       
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; '''XForms form control''' &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; '''Closest XHTML equivalent''' &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; '''Description''' &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;For entry of small amounts of text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;For entry of large amounts of text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;secret&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;For entry of large amounts of text&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;secret&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For entry of sensitive information &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;output&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; N/A &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For inline display of any instance data &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;range&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; N/A &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For smooth &quot;volume control&quot; selection of a value &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;upload&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For upload of file or device data &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;button&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For activation of form events &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;submit&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For submission of form data &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;select&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;select multiple=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt; or multiple &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For selection of zero, one, or many options&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;select1&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; &lt;select&gt; or multiple &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; For selection of just one option among several&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

== XForms Action ==
In the course of form processing, often some particular action needs to happen.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; '''XForms Action''' &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; '''Description''' &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; setfocus &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; Gives focus to a particular form control. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; setvalue &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; send &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; Submits all or part of the instance data. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; reset &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; Resets all or part of the instance data. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;td&gt; revalidate &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; Revalidates the instance data. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

== XForms Methods ==
The XForms specification uses and builds upon XPath, which includes adding some method calls useful for forms: These can be called at any point where XPath is allowed. Additionally, implementations can support “extension functions” to provide additional functionality.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

  &lt;td&gt; Returns the minimum or maximum value of the indicated nodes &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt; count-non-empty()&lt;/td&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Goals: 
* To explain how firms decide how much to produce
* To explain how prices are determined

In order to achieve these goals, let's start with some definitions.

==Profit==
Assume the goal of the firm is to maximize profit -- to make as much
money as possible

&lt;math&gt;Profit = Revenue - Cost&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Revenue = Price * Quantity&lt;/math&gt;

There are 2 types of profit
# Accounting profit = Revenue - Explicit costs
#* explicit costs are actual payments for inputs
#* wages you pay employees, cost of machines, other physical inputs
#* firms report accounting profits
# Economic profit = Revenue - Explicit costs - Implicit costs
#* implicit costs are the opportunity costs of non-purchased inputs
#* extra money you could have earned doing something else
#* what the owner of a business could earning working for another company
#* return you could have earned investing money in the stock market, instead of buying machines for your startup

 Firm makes USD 100,000 in revenue.  Firm spends USD 50,000 to produce the good.  Owner used to make USD 40,000 at another job before opening this business.

:Accounting profit = USD 100,000 - 50,000 = 50,000
:Economic profit = USD 100,000 - 50,000 - 40,000 = 10,000
:Relationship between accounting profit and economic profit
:Accounting profit &gt;= Economic profit

Economists (almost) always think and speak in terms of economic profit.  

We also often refer to &quot;zero profit&quot;.  When we say, &quot;zero economic profit&quot; we mean that you are doing just as well with this business as with the next-best alternative.

If you are earning zero economic profit, you should stay in business.

==The Short Run (SR) v. The Long Run (LR)==
*SR: Period of time during which you can not change all inputs to production.  At least one input is fixed.
**Ex. The size of your factory is fixed in the short run.
*LR: Period of time in which all inputs can be changed.  All inputs can be varied in the long run.
**Ex. You can expand your factory in the long run.

We can redefine the SR and the LR in terms of costs.

*Fixed Cost (FC): Cost that does not change with the amount of output. 
**Ex. The cost of land, machines, factories, your lease, your property taxes.
**No matter how much I produce, it costs me the same.
*Variable Cost (VC): Cost that changes with the amount of production.
**Ex. Amount spent on workers, electricity, etc.

If you increase your output, your VC increases.

:In the SR, at least one input is fixed, so at least one input cost is fixed.  Therefore in the SR, FC&gt;0.
:In the LR, there are no fixed inputs, therefore FC=0.
:Total Cost (TC) = FC + VC

Hint: Make a separate sheet of paper in your notes where you define all the costs and write the relevant equations. 

For now let us focus on the SR.

This section is mainly concerned with macroeconomics.

==Production Function==
The production function describes the relationship between all the inputs and the quantity of the output.

Ex. Suppose that you have a machine which originally cost USD 100.  It has no resale value.  You can hire workers at USD 20/hr each. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!L||Q||MPL
|-
|0||0||
|-
|1||4||
|-
|2||9||
|-
|3||17||
|-
|4||20||
|-
|5||21||
|}

Inputs include labor and the machine.

The machine is a fixed input, and the number of workers varies.

The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the amount by which the output changes if you change the amount of the variable input (the number of workers).  

From the example:  In the beginning,, as L is increased, Q increases by an increasing amount.  But as workers are added, the increase in Q decreases.

==Principle of diminishing returns==
Suppose output is produced using 2 or more inputs and you increase one input while hold the other fixed.  Beyond some point -- the point of diminishing returns -- output will increase at a decreasing rate.

Why is this?  Because more and more workers are sharing a fixed quantity of other inputs.

Ex. Pizza Production.

If we didn't have diminishing returns, we could grow all the world's crops on a single acre of land, just by adding enough fertilizer.

The point of diminishing returns in the table above is at L=4.  When you hire the 4th worker, he doesn't add as much to total output as did the previous worker.

Returning to the example, suppose you have a machine which costs $100.  It has no resale value.  You can hire workers at $20 each.  

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!L||Q||MPL||FC||VC||TC||AFC||AVC||ATC||MC
|-
|0|||0|| || || || || || || || 
|-
|1||4|| || || || || || || || 
|-
|2||9|| || || || || || || || 
|-
|3||17|| || || || || || || || 
|-
|4||20|| || || || || || || || 
|-
|5||21|| || || || || || || || 
|}

Consider the example.  Is this firm in the short run or the long run?  Answer: the short run, because of the presence of fixed cost of $100 for the machine.

&lt;small&gt;Long run is still subject to law of diminishing returns, but in some corporation examples, this may be due to the limit in the number of consumers. Just like the limited land and fertilizer example, there is a limit to the number of supermarkets, hamburger chains, bakery chains , white goods stores, consumer electronic chain stores and hardware stores that can be opened before there is not enough customers to cover the variable costs and per outlet fixed costs. &lt;/small&gt;

On average, how much am I spending on the fixed input(s).

Graph AFC:

&lt;math&gt;AFC = \frac{FC}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

On average, how much am I spending on the variable input(s)?

Graph AVC:

&lt;math&gt;AVC = \frac{VC}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

Graph ATC:

&lt;math&gt;ATC = \frac{TC}{q} = AFC + AVC&lt;/math&gt;

If I increase or decrease my output slightly, how do my costs change?

MC looks like: 

&lt;math&gt;MC = \frac{TC_2 - TC_1}{q_2 - q_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Marginal costs begin to increase when you add the 4th worker (point of diminishing returns)

Why?  Beyond this point, each worker is relatively less productive, but you are paying each worker the same wage.  

Graph the relationship between MC and MPL:

MC intersects AVC and ATC at their respective minimum points.

Why?  Think of ATC as your GPA.  Think of MC as your grade in this class.  

*If your grade in this class is less than your GPA then your GPA will fall a little.
*If your grade in this class is greater than your GPA then your GPA will rise a little.
*If your grade in this class is equal to your GPA then your GPA will not change.

Similarly, when the cost of producing an additional good is less than the average cost, the average cost will fall a little.

When the cost of producing an additional good is greater than the average cost, the average cost will rise a little.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Q of widgets||TC of widgets
|-

|-
|1||11
|-
|2||13
|-
|3||16
|-
|4||20
|-
|5||25
|-
|6||31
|}

The AFC of producing 5 widgets is:

The AVC of producing 4 widgets is:

Example: You observe that at your current production of daikon radishes, the ATC is $1 and the MC is $2.  What will happen if you increase production of daikon radishes by 1?

# MC will remain constant
# MC will decline
# ATC will rise
# ATC will decline
# Not enough information to say

==Firm Production Decision==

Q: How much should a firm produce in order to maximize profits?

Goal of any firm is to choose the quantity &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.
b

==Profit Maximization Rule==

Profit is maximized where &lt;math&gt;MR = MC&lt;/math&gt;.

Profit maximization rule: Produce until the point where the change in revenue from producing 1 more unit equals the change in cost from producing 1 more unit.

Why? 

Suppose MR &gt; MC.  If I produce 1 more unit, my revenues increase by more than my costs.  Therefore, if MR &gt; MC, producing more will increase my profit.  If I can increase my profit by changing how much I produce, then when producing where MR &gt; MC can't be profit-maximizing. 

Suppose MR &lt; MC.  If I produce 1 less unit, my revenues decrease by less than my costs decrease.  Therefore, if MR &lt; MC, I can increase profit by decreasing output.  If I can increase profit when MR &lt; MC, then choosing q such that MR &lt; MC can not be profit-maximizing.  

So, in order to maximize profit, I must choose a quantity q such that MR = MC.

MR = MC is an equilibrium in the sense that it is the only place where there is no incentive to change the production level.

This rule, the profit maximization rule, is just an application of the marginal principle (MB = MC).

Why?  This MB of producing an extra unit is the extra revenue you get.  MR is the MB.  So the 2 statements are equivalent.  The marginal principle is more general, and the profit maximization rule is specific to the firm production decision.

==Perfect Competition==

Now let us apply the profit maximization rule to the specific case of perfect competition.  First, list the characteristics of a perfectly competitive firm.

Characteristics
# Homogeneous: every firm produces exactly the same good.  Consumers can't tell any difference between what one firm produces and what another firm produces.
# Many firms: each firm represents a very small part of the overall industry.
# Price taker: any individual firms's decision of how much to produce will not affect the market price.  This is a result of the first 2 characteristics.
# Free entry and free exit: There exist no barriers to prevent firms from entering or exiting a certain market in the long run.  This implies zero economic profits in the long run.

Very few firms or markets would satisfy these characteristics.  Closest example of a perfectly competitive market is agriculture
# a particular variety of wheat is the same no matter where it is grown
# there are many small farmers, so that whether or not Farmer Bob produces an extra 5 units does not affect the market price

Despite the rare and extreme nature of perfect competition, it provides a useful baseline case.

Graph the typical representative perf. comp. firm next to the industry to which it belongs.  Show how price is determined in the market and then guides the individual firm's decision.

Profit-maximization rule: Choose q such that MR=MC.

q* = that amount which a perfectly competitive firm will produce given P* in the market.

Revenue = Pq*

==Profit Maximization in Perfect Competition==

From the assumption of perfect competition, any individual firm's decision of how much to produce does not affect the market price.  Therefore, P = MR for an individual firm ,( because it is known that price is constant for any quantity produced, and marginal revenue is the price of producing one further unit of quantity, and price is constant ; price is constant because price does not increase at any quantity demanded because most other companies will still sell at the same price and no one can compete at a higher price).

Remember that profit maximization rule says to set q such that MR = MC ( because of the law of diminishing returns, when MC is rising and has reached MR, MC will be greater than MR for any more units, or the marginal profit which is MR - MC will be less than zero ).   

Since P = MR and the firm sets MR = MC, we can write that in perfect competition, 

Set q* such that P = MC ( because for every unit before the qth unit, there was a net profit of P-MC &gt; 0 for each unit , because MC was rising and has to be less than the MC at MC = P ).   

On the graph, find the point where the price line intersect the marginal cost curve.  Then look at the horizontal axis to determine which q corresponds to that point.  This is the firm's profit maximizing quantity.

== Cost and Price  Minimization in  Perfect Competition ==
There is also an equalitarian, non-corrupt side of perfectly competing market that suggests transparent market competition is good for the consumer: as each company seeks to to produce the last unit where the marginal cost is just less than the price, and therefore have produced as many profitable units as possible, so they will try to sell at a price that is the lowest and still profitable , which is above the average total cost, and they will try to price at a quantity above the minimum average total unit cost. If they sell below the ATC , they can cover variable but not fixed cost, and so they try to reduce costs. If they sell above the minimum ATC, their competitor will sell more and they will try to increase efficiency to match the minimal ATC. So this brings up the Utopian vision that in a perfectly competing market, the fair price is that buyers get the same price as the minimum unit cost which covers all the cost of production including the fair minimum costs for labour and management , and no more. And producers sell at a maximum  quantity where their last units of production still turn a profit. The lowest prices and as much as possible while letting the adequately efficient producer survive. P = MC = minATC.  Economic heaven!

==Case 1: Positive Profits==

Profit &gt; 0

Revenue &gt; Total Cost

Intuitive example: On average, it costs $5 to make each unit.  Can sell each unit for $7.  Must be making a profit.

ATC(q*) = how much it costs you on average to produce each unit, given that you are producing q* units.

Revenue = p q* = A + B

TC = B

Profit = Revenue - TC = A

Note: it is a common mistake to identify q* as the q where MC = minimum ATC.  This is wrong!  This quantity does not generally maximize profit.  It maximizes profit per unit.

However, in the LR, because of free entry and exit, profit will equal zero, and ATC will be minimized.  This is a feature of perfect competition.  But the firm is not trying to minimize ATC -- it tries to maximize (TR - TC).  ATC is only minimized indirectly in the long run.

Should a firm stop producing (shut down) if profits are negative?  (Recall this is in the SR.)  Answer: It depends.

This an old joke about economists.  They can never give a Yes or No answer to a question.  They always say, &quot;It depends.&quot;  That isn't really true in general, but in this case, &quot;It depends,&quot; is the correct answer.

Note: stopping production does not mean going out of business.

Ex. Tourist businesses might shut down in the off-season.

Why?  Whether or not you are producing anything, in the SR, you still have to pay your FC.

You should stop producing only if you are losing more money by producing than by shutting down.

We need a rule.  Let's derive it.


:Loss &gt; FC
:TC - Revenue &gt; FC
:FC + VC - Revenue &gt; FC
:VC - Revenue &gt; 0 
&quot;VC &gt; Revenue

That is, shut down if you can't afford to pay your workers.  If you continue producing, your profit will be negative.  But if you shut down, you limit your losses to the amount of FC you have to pay.  If VC &gt; Revenue, you'd lose even more than FC by staying open.  In general, if you are losing money, you have to decide whether shutting down or staying open will minimize your losses.

==Case 2: Negative Profits: Stay Open==

You lose money because P &lt; ATC

But since P &gt; AVC,

P &gt; AVC

P*q &gt; AVC*q

Revenue &gt; VC

So you are able to cover the cost of your labor inputs, and pay some of your fixed cost as well, by staying open.

Revenue = B + C

TC = A + B + C

Negative profit = A

VC = C

FC = A + B

If you keep producing, lose A

If you stop producing, lose A + B

Example: P* = 8.  Calculate loss, fixed cost, and explain why the firm should keep producing.  This is the mini we had in class.  Your answer can be showing the amount of VC, FC, and calculating profits for the case of staying open and for shutting down.

For fixed costs such as capital, it then depends on the after-tax cost of capital resource over the life of the capital resource, because if say the resource has a life of 10 years, and it takes 8 years to cover the replacement cost after tax deductions for depreciation, then it is still profitable to stay open for 10 years. 

If there is a recurring fixed cost , then if the fixed cost minus tax deduction exceeds the  revenue less variable cost, then money is being slowly lost over the long term.

==Case 3: Negative Profits: Stop Production==

Negative profits:

Stop production if:

VC &gt; Revenue

q * AVC &gt; P * q

AVC &gt; P

Shut down if P &lt; AVC on the graph.

Graph the perf. comp. firms costs, with P below the AVC curve. 

Revenue = C

TC = A + B + C

Negative profit = A + B

VC = B + C

FC = TC - VC  = A

If you keep producing, you lose A + B

If you shut down, you lose A

So you lose less money by shutting down.

==Derivation of the Firm's Supply Curve==

We have shown that a firm will keep producing as long as P &gt;= AVC.

Suppose P &lt; AVC.  Then q* = 0

:If P = AVC then q &gt; 0
:If P &gt; AVC then q &gt; 0

So for all P &gt;= AVC, there exists a certain q that a firm will supply.  The firm supply curve is the MC at or greater than AVC.  

By the Law of Supply, as P increases, Qs increases.

Why?  Firms produce more.  Firms that have stopped producing, but haven't gone out of business, may start producing again.

The elasticity of supply depends on the MC curve.

:An elastic S curve means that a firm can increase its Qs without a very large increase in MC.
:An inelastic S curve means that MC increases sharply for an increase in the Qs.

Market Supply: Add up all the firms' S at every P.

== Overview ==

ODBC is the acronym for the oft used API Open Database Connectivity.  Many applications and application programmers use ODBC in order to access relational databases, such as SQL and Microsoft Access, and to manipulate the data within the databases.  Specifically, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), which is based on ODBC, is the API used by applications developed in Java to perform these various tasks.  Moreover, JDBC is now capable of handling advanced datatypes in SQL which in turn becomes useful when dealing with XML.  Also, JDBC has within it the ability to actually create XML data.  Furthermore, the use of JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) along with JDBC provides yet anther way of manipulating and using relational databases and XML.  In any event, there are multiple ways to use the JDBC API with XML.
== JDBC and XML Documents ==

Many Java Applications written today will more than likely interact with an SQL database (or a relational database, but for the sake of uniformity, we will work with SQL.)  Depending on the intent of the application, there may be the case of actually storing an XML document for display or for manipulation.  Whatever the case, JDBC now supports all datatypes defined in the SQL:1999 specification.  One of theses datatypes is the CLOB (character large object) datatype.  This datatype is perfect for storing XML documents.  This is one way XML and the JDBC API works with each other.

== JDBC and XML Production == 

One of the more interesting things about JDBC is that it can be used to gather MetaData.  Meta-data is nothing more than data about data.  From an XML standpoint, this is very useful because we can create XML data on the fly with nothing more than a table name.  The class that makes this possible is java.sql.ResultSetMetaData.  Consequently this class is a part of the JDBC API.

== JDBC and JAXP ==

Another intriguing way of dealing with XML objects is within the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing).  JAXP and JDBC together provide an infrastructure for developing applicaitons using XML and SQL.  

Whenever XML instances in applications are dealt with, an XML parser is a good tool to use.  The XML parser turns the XML document into an object or something the application can uses.  Specifically, Document Object Model (DOM) takes and XML instance and converts it into a tree.  This specific parser can be found in the JAXP API.  You may then store the parsed object in an SQL database for future use.  This may open up many ideas of how one may use JAXP and JDBC together when an issue presents itself of dealing with XML and SQL.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Verbs''' are the most important and complex element of Bambara grammar.  There are some important complications created by nontransitive verbs.  Many of the most common and basic verbs in Bambara take no direct object and can only be used with a postpositional object.  For example, &quot;n be taa sugu la&quot; is literally &quot;I go to market&quot; and &quot;n be be bo Ameriki&quot; is literally &quot;I come from America.&quot;  There is another class of verbs that are superficially intransitive, such as kalanke, baarake, monike, dumunike, etc...  Such verbs are distinguished by the ending &quot;-ke&quot; which means to do and are more properly considered as a direct object fused to a verb.  The direct objects here are gerund forms of transitive verbs, which are formed by adding the suffix &quot;-li&quot;. Thus &quot;ka tige&quot; is &quot;to cut&quot;, &quot;n be jiri tige&quot; is &quot;I cut trees&quot;, &quot;tigeli&quot; is &quot;cutting&quot; and &quot;n be tigelike&quot; is &quot;I do cutting.&quot;  

===Verb Conjugations===

This difference between transitive and intransitive verbs is crucial when conjugating verbs in the past perfect.  The formulae for the affirmative and negative present are as follows (parenthesis indicate that the term is optional depending on the construction of the verb):
;
;Affirmative present: subject + be + (direct object) + verb;
  Example:  N be taa sugu la, N b'a don
;Negative present: subjective + te + (direct object) + verb;
  Example:  N te taa sugu la, N t'a don
;
The formulae for affirmative present of transitive and intransitive verbs are as follows:
;
;Affirmative past perfect transitive: subject + ye + direct object + verb;
  Example:  N y'a don, N y'a fo
;Affirmative past perfect intransitivie: subject + verb + ra/na/la;
  Example:  N taara, N bora Ameriki
;
The formula for the negative past perfect is the same for both transitive and intransitive verbs:
;
;Negative past perfect: subject + ma + (direct object) + verb;
  Example: N ma taa, N m'a don
;
As the formulae, suggest, intrasitive verbs are slightly irregular in that the ending varies depending on the verb and follows no fixed rule.  Thus the perfect past of &quot;ka bo&quot; is &quot;bora&quot; while the perfect past of &quot;ka men&quot; is &quot;mena&quot; and the perfect past of &quot;ka fili&quot; is &quot;filila.&quot;  The distinction between transitive and intranstive verbs also plays a crucial role in passive constructions.  For example, &quot;ka ta&quot; is a transitive verb meaning &quot;to take&quot; and &quot;N b'a ta&quot; means &quot;I take it&quot;, but &quot;a be ta&quot; means &quot;it is taken.&quot;  In general, if a transitive verb is used with a direct object, the subject is the object of the verb in the passive voice.

In addition to the present and the past perfect tenses, Bambara includes an imperfect past, a pluperfect past, a future, and a present and past progressive tense, which are formulated as follows:
;
;Affirmative imperfect past:  subject + tun + be + (direct object) + verb
;Negative imperfect past:  subject + tun + be + (direct object) + verb
;
;Affirmative pluperfect past transitive: subject + tun + ye + direct object + verb
;Affirmative pluperfect past intransitive: subject + tun + verb + ra/na/la
;Negative pluperfect past: subject + tun + ma + (direct object) + verb
;
;Affirmative future: subject + bena + (direct object) + verb
;Negative future: subject + tena + (direct object) + verb
;
;Affirmative present progressive: subject + beka + (direct object) + verb
;Negative present progressive: subject + teka + (direct object) + verb
;
;Affirmative past progressive: subject + tun + beka + (direct object) + verb
;Negative past progressive: subject + tun + teka + (direct object) + verb
;
These tenses are not used quite the same as in English.  The future tense, for example, is closer to the English construction &quot;going to...&quot; and indicates relatively certain events in the near future.  For other future events, one uses the present.  The present is generally used more to indicate general states of affairs or habitual actions.  Many expressions that we place in the present, would be placed in the past perfect in Bambara.  Thus, the example we used above &quot;n t'a don&quot; (I don't know) is rarely used in Bambara - one usually says &quot;n m'a don&quot; (I didn't know).  Use of the present tense in this case indicates a tendency not to know and usually connotes refusal or incapacity to know.  The present and past progressive are also used much less frequently in Bambara than in English and serve primarily to emphasize the immediacy of an action or its contemporaneity with another.

There is also a subjunctive construction in Bambara that is used with certain prepositions and prepositional phrases including &quot;sani&quot;, &quot;walasa&quot;, &quot;ka fe ka&quot;.  The subjunctive is formed in the same way as the present indicative but with &quot;ka&quot; in the place of &quot;be&quot; or &quot;kana&quot; in the place of &quot;te&quot;.  For example &quot;a y'ke, walasa a fa kana sa&quot; would mean &quot;He did it, so that his father would not die.&quot;  &quot;Walasa&quot; here captures the idea of &quot;so that&quot; or &quot;in order that&quot; and &quot;his father would not die&quot;, which is in the conditional in English, is conjugated in the subjunctive in Bambara.  

The past perfect, the imperfect, and the pluperfect are also used to indicate conditionality in hypothetical statements.  The past perfect is used in the antecedent of a conditional statement to indicate a potential situationt that has not yet arisen.  For example, to say &quot;if he comes, call me&quot; one would say &quot;ni a nana, n wele&quot; which translates literally as if he has come, call me.  Here the past perfect indicates that he has not in fact come yet, but that he may come.  In counterfactual conditionals, where the antecedent is a clearly false statement (usually about the past), one uses the pluperfect.  Thus &quot;if he had come, I would have called you&quot; is translated as &quot;ni a tun nana, n tun b'i wele&quot;.  As the example suggests, the consequent of the conditional must be placed in the imperfect tense to indicate that the past action was possible rather than actual.  

===Verb Modifiers===

Verbs can also be modified with suffixes in several ways, and modified verbs constitute a substantial portion of the nouns, adjective, and adverbs in Bambara

====verb + len====
The suffix &quot;-len&quot; denotes the past participle of a verb.  If the verb is transitive, the adjective denotes an object that has undergone the action, if the verb is intransitive, it indicates an object that has performed the action.  Thus, as we saw above, &quot;ka tige&quot; is the transitive verb &quot;to cut&quot;, so &quot;yiri tigelen&quot; indicates a tree that has been cut.  &quot;Ka taa&quot;, however, is the intransitive verb &quot;to go&quot;, so &quot;misi taalen&quot; indicates that the cow is gone.  We will discuss how to construct complete sentences using past participles later.

====verb + to====
The suffix &quot;-to&quot; corresponds roughly to the prepositional phrase &quot;as verb-ing.&quot;  Again, the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs is crucial.  Thus, &quot;yiri tigeto&quot; means, as the tree is/was being cut, whereas &quot;misi taato&quot; means &quot;as the cow is/was going.&quot;  We will discuss how to form complete sentences using this construction later.

Most verbs also take indirect objects modified by a postposition.  For example, &quot;ka di&quot;, &quot;to give&quot; is usually constructed with &quot;ma&quot; in the following way: subject + direct object + di + indirect object + ma.  Thus &quot;N be wari di olu ma&quot; means &quot;I give money to them.&quot;

=== Some Bambara Verbs ===

;ka bó
:to come from

;ka na
:to come to

;ka taa
:to go

;ka segin
:to return

;ke kalanké
:to learn

;ka tobiliké
:to cook

;ka duminiké
:to eat

;ka sébén
:to write

;ka kó
:to shower

;ka si
:to pass the night

;ka tilen
:to pass the day

Also, &quot;na&quot; puts things in the past tense and &quot;sa&quot; at the end of a sentence gives it necessity, as in the French phrase &quot;il faut.&quot;

The words &quot;ka&quot; and &quot;man&quot; are like the French verb &quot;être&quot; (to be). &quot;ka&quot; is positive and &quot;man&quot; is negative.

== Data Compression ==

When transmitting digital data, we find that frequently we can't send our information as quickly as we would like. Specific limits, such as Shannon's Channel Capacity, restrict the amount of digital information that can be transmitted over a given channel. Therefore, if we want to transmit more data, we need to find a way to make our data ''smaller''.

To make data smaller, we implement one of a number of techniques known as data compression. There are a number of different compression algorithms, but they can all be broken down into two categories: Lossless algorithms, and lossy algorithms.

The fundamental function of a compression is to remove redundancy, where redundancy is all that could be removed or expressed in a different way, whilst not removing it's meaning.

== Lossy Algorithms ==

Lossy algorithms are techniques that can be used to transmit a &quot;pretty good&quot; version of the data. With a lossy algorithm, there is always going to be a certain amount of data lost in the conversion. Lossy algorithms provide much higher compression rates then lossless algorithms, but the downfall is that information must be lost to attain those high rates. An example of a lossy compression algorithm is JPEG image files, or MP3 music files. If the lossy algorithm is good enough, the loss might not be noticeable by the recipient.

== Lossless Algorithms ==

Lossless algorithms decrease the size of a given signal, while at the same time not losing any information from the original. For this reason, Lossless compression algorithms are preferable to lossy algorithms, especially when the data needs to arrive at the recipient intact. Examples of lossless compression algorithms are ZIP files, and GIF images.

==Run-Length Encoding==
Run-length encoding (RLE) is probably one of the best known compression techniques. Here is how it works:
Let's assume we have some input data: 'aaaabbbc'
Now RLE compresses this by expressing the amount of times each symbol occurs, if it occurs more than 2 times. 
This 'compresses' to '4a3bc' which means as much as 4 x a, 3 x b, 1 x c.
We don't express a data item explicitly if it occurs twice or just once. 
We would just lose space.

==Huffman Coding==

Huffman coding is a very powerful compression technique that can be used as an optimal lossless encoding technique.

Huffman at wikipedia: [[w:Huffman coding]]

==Variable-Length Encoding==

== Notes ==

Data compression, while a related field to coding theory, is not strictly in the scope of this book, and so we will not cover it any further here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Acoustics}}

I plan to discuss the workings of an acoustic guitar, and how the topics that we have studied apply.  This will largely be vibrations of strings and vibrations of cavities.


== Introduction ==

The acoustic guitar is one of the most well known musical instruments.  Although precise dates are not known, the acoustic guitar is generally thought to have originated sometime during the Renaissance in the form of a lute, a smaller fretless form of what is known today.  After evolving over the course of about 500 years, the guitar today consists of a few major components: the strings and neck, the bridge, soundboard, head, and internal cavity.

== Strings, Neck, and Head ==

The strings are what actually create vibration on the guitar.  On a standard acoustic, there are six strings, each with a different constant linear density.  Strings run along the length of the neck, and are wound around adjustable tuning pegs located on the head.  These tuning pegs can be turned to adjust the tension in the string.  This allows a modification of the wave speed, governed by the equation

&lt;math&gt;c^2=T/\rho&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the wave speed [m/s] as a function of tension [N], T, and rho is the linear density [kg/m^3].  The string is assumed to fixed at the head (x=0) and mass loaded at the bridge (x=L).

To determine the vibrating frequency of an open string, a general harmonic solution (GHS) is assumed, &lt;math&gt;y(x,t)=Aexp(j(wt-kx))+Bexp(j(wt-kx))&lt;/math&gt;

To solve for coefficients A and B, boundary conditions at x=0 and x=L are evaluated.  At x=0, string velocity (dy/dx) must be zero at all times because that end is assumed to be fixed.  Applying this knowledge to the GHS produces 

&lt;math&gt;y(x,t)=-2jAsin(kx)*exp(jwt)&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, at the bridge (a.k.a the mass load at x=L), the bridge and soundboard (along with any other piece that may vibrate) is assumed to be a lumped element of mass m.  The overall goal with this boundary condition is to determine the velocity of the mass.  From Newton's second law (F=ma), the only force involved is the tension force in the string.  The y-component of this force divided by mass m equals the acceleration.  Knowing that acceleration equals velocity times jw (a=jwu),

[[Image:string_tension.bmp]]

&lt;math&gt;u(L,t)=-T/(j*w*m)*(dy/dx)&lt;/math&gt;

evaluated at x=L.  Combining the two boundary equations and simplifying, a final equation can be obtained

&lt;math&gt;cot(kL)=(m/ms)kL&lt;/math&gt;

where k is the wavenumber (w/c), L is the string length, m is the lumped mass of the guitar body, ms is the total mass of the string (linear density times length), w is the frequency, and c is the wave speed.  If the ratio of m/ms is large (which in a guitar's case, it is), these frequencies are designated by kL=n*pi.  Simplified, the fundamental frequency can be given by 

&lt;math&gt;f=sqrt(T/rho) / 2L&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore to adjust the resonance frequency of the string, either change the tension (turn the tuning knob), change the linear density (play a different string), or adjust the length (use the fretboard).

To determine the location of the frets, musical notes must be considered.  In the musical world, it is common practice to use a tempered scale.  In this scale, an A note is set at 440 Hz.  To get the next note in the scale, multiply that frequency by the 12th root of 2 (approximately 1.059), and an A-sharp will be produced.  Multiply by the same factor for the next note, and so on.  With this in mind, to increase f by a factor of 1.059, a corresponding factor should be applied to L.  That factor is 1/17.817, with L in inches.  For example, consider an open A string, vibrating at 440 Hz.  For a 26 inch string, the position of the first fret is (26/17.817=1.459) inches from the head.  The second fret will be ((26-1.459)/17.817) inches from the first, and so on.

== Bridge ==

The bridge is the connection point between the strings and the soundboard.  The vibration of the string moves the assumed mass load of the bridge, which vibrates the soundboard, described next.

== Soundboard ==

The soundboard increases the surface area of vibration, increasing the initial intensity of the note, and is assisted by the internal cavity.

== Internal Cavity ==

The internal cavity acts as a Helmholtz resonator, and helps to amplify the sound.  As the sound board vibrates, the sound wave is able to resonate inside.</text>

I'm not sure when I want to introduce this book. I have alot of material on all the subjects here, but I don't have the time right now to pull it all together. This will be, I think, a very big book, and I don't want to enter into it lightly. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

:I would like to break this one up into subpages in the near future, in an effort to attract contributors, make it more pretty, and make it more easy to edit and read. Also, we can have dedicated pages to test-taking strategies and practice questions for each portion of the exam. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:45, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

== Additional Section ==

I've added a new, online resources section with several links to free test preparation websites. I'd like to make sure that all links are quality-assured and I'd like to make sure that money-hungry companies and websites which exploit foreign students by promising to divulge &quot;secrets&quot; to the GRE are excluded from the lists.

==Merge==
I may have been a bit hasty here, but I have merged GRE Preparation Guide with GRE. There had been no response to the suggestion from the original author (Phoe6) on the talk page. There wasn't any real need for having two separate books for GRE. Both books had only a few pages and were ideally placed for being merged.

=Learning Objectives=

Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to
* Discuss XML-RPC
* Create XML-RPC Code based on Examples

=RPC Defined=
In order to fully understand XML-RPC, we should fist define RPC. A '''Remote Procedure Call''' ('''RPC''') is a protocol that allows a computer program running on one host to cause code to be executed on another host without the programmer needing to explicitly code for this.  An RPC is initiated by the caller (client) sending a request message to a remote system (the server) to execute a certain procedure using arguments supplied. A result message is returned to the caller. There are many variations and subtleties in various implementations, resulting in a variety of different (incompatible) RPC protocols.

In order to allow servers to be accessed by differing clients, a number of standardized RPC systems have been created. Most of these use an Interface Description Language (IDL) to allow various platforms to call the RPC.  Web services were the first real attempt to implement RPC between platforms. Using Web services a .NET client can call a remote procedure implemented in Java on a Unix server (and vice versa).

Web services use [[XML]] as the IDL, and HTTP as the network protocol. The advantage of this system is simplicity and standardization, the IDL is a text file that is widely understood, and HTTP is built into almost all modern operating systems. An example of such an RPC system is XML-RPC. 

=XML-RPC Defined=

'''XML-RPC''' ('''Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call''') is a Remote Procedure Call protocol encoded in [[XML]]. It is a very simple protocol, defining only a handful of data types and commands, and the entire description can be printed on two pages of paper. This is in stark contrast to most RPC systems, where the standards documents often run into the thousands of pages and require considerable software support in order to be used.

It was first created by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer/ Dave Winer] in 1995 with [http://www.microsoft.com/ Microsoft]. However, Microsoft considered it too simple and started adding functionality. After several rounds of this, the standard was no longer so simple and became what is now [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP/ SOAP].

&quot;We wanted a clean, extensible format that's very simple. It should be possible for an HTML coder to be able to look at a file containing an XML-RPC procedure call, understand what it's doing, and be able to modify it and have it work on the first or second try... We also wanted it to be an easy to implement protocol that could quickly be adapted to run in other environments or on other operating systems.&quot; -[http://www.xmlrpc.com/ xmlrpc.com]

==Examples==

An example of a typical XML-RPC request would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;methodCall&gt;
   &lt;methodName&gt;examples.getStateName&lt;/methodName&gt;
   &lt;params&gt;
     &lt;param&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;41&lt;/i4&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
     &lt;/param&gt;
   &lt;/params&gt;
 &lt;/methodCall&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


An example of a typical XML-RPC response would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;methodResponse&gt;
   &lt;params&gt;
     &lt;param&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;South Dakota&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
     &lt;/param&gt;
   &lt;/params&gt;
 &lt;/methodResponse&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


A typical XML-RPC fault would be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;methodResponse&gt;
   &lt;fault&gt;
     &lt;value&gt;
       &lt;struct&gt;
         &lt;member&gt;
           &lt;name&gt;faultCode&lt;/name&gt;
           &lt;value&gt;&lt;int&gt;4&lt;/int&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
         &lt;/member&gt;
         &lt;member&gt;
           &lt;name&gt;faultString&lt;/name&gt;
           &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;Too many parameters.&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
         &lt;/member&gt;
       &lt;/struct&gt;
     &lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;/fault&gt;
 &lt;/methodResponse&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A final example, comparing a PHP associative array with an equivalent XML-RPC &lt;struct&gt;.  This array:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
Array
(
	[0] =&gt; 'dogs',
	[1] =&gt; 'cats',
	['animals'] =&gt; Array(
		[0] =&gt; FALSE,
		[1] =&gt; 'little_dogs',
		[2] =&gt; 'little_cats',
		[3] =&gt; 5,
		[4] =&gt; 2.3,
		[5] =&gt; 1,
			),
);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Becomes the following XML-RPC: 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;methodResponse&gt;
      &lt;params&gt;
         &lt;param&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;
               &lt;struct&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;0
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;dogs&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;1
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;cats&lt;/string&gt;
                     &lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/member&gt;
                  &lt;member&gt;
                     &lt;name&gt;animals
                     &lt;/name&gt;
                     &lt;value&gt;
                           &lt;array&gt;
                              &lt;data&gt;

== Magnetic Fields ==
[[Image:Basic Inductor with B-field.svg|center]]

Inductors store energy in the form of a magnetic field. The magnetic field of an inductor actually extends outside of the inductor, and can be affected (or can affect) another inductor close by. The image above shows a magnetic field (red lines) extending around an inductor.

== Mutual Inductance ==

[[Image:Transformer.svg|right|200px]]

If we accidentally or purposefully put two inductors close together, we can actually transfer voltage and current from one inductor to another. This property is called '''Mutual Inductance'''. A device which utilizes mutual inductance to alter the voltage or current output is called a '''transformer'''.

The inductor that creates the magnetic field is called the ''primary coil'', and the inductor that picks up the magnetic field is called the ''secondary coil''. Transformers are designed to have the greatest mutual inductance possible by winding both coils on the same ''core''.  (In calculations for inductance, we need to know which materials form the path for magnetic flux.  ''Air core'' coils have low inductance;  Cores of iron or other magnetic materials are better 'conductors' of magnetic flux.)

The voltage that appears in the secondary is caused by the ''change'' in the shared magnetic field, each time the current through the primary changes.  Thus, transformers work on A.C. power, since the voltage and current change continuously.

== Ideal Transformers ==

[[Image:Schaltbild Trafo.png]]

== Modern Inductors ==
[[Image:Single-phase transformer.svg|300px|center]]

When the coils of number of turns N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; conducts current . There exists a Magnetic Field B on the coil . Changes of B will generates an Induced Voltage on the turns of coil N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as shown
:;-ξ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;N_p \frac{dB}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
:;-ξ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;N_s \frac{dB}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of -ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over -ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:;-ξ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; / -ξ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{N_p}{N_s}&lt;/math&gt;

If Input voltage at coil of turn N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = -ξ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and the Output voltage will be
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_s}{V_p}&lt;/math&gt; = -ξ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; / -ξ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{N_s}{N_p}&lt;/math&gt;


:;&lt;math&gt;V_s = V_p \frac{N_s}{N_p}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, this device is capable of Increase, Decrease and Conduct  Voltage just by changing the turn ratio of the coils

Therefore, the output voltage can be
* Increased or Step Up by increasing number of turns of coil N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; greater than N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

* Decreased or Step Down by Decreasing number of turns of coil N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; less than N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

* Buffered by setting number of turns of coil N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; equal to N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;


The following photo shows several examples of the construction of
inductors and transformers. At the upper right is a toroidal core
type (toroid is the mathematical term for a donut shape).  This
shape very efficiently contains the magnetic flux, so less
power (or signal) is lost to heating up the core.

[[Image:Transformers.jpg]]

== Step Up and Step Down ==

The terms 'step-up' and 'step-down' are used to compare the secondary (output) voltage to the voltage supplied to the primary.

Many transformers are specially designed to operate exclusively as step-up or step-down. While an ideal transformer could simply be 'turned around', we find that many actual transformers are built to perform best at certain ranges of voltage and current.  

For example, a power transformer may be used to step down household AC (about 120 Volts) to 24V for home heating controls, etc.  The output current is higher than the primary current in this example, so the transformer is made with a heavier gauge of wire in its secondary windings.  

In transformers that deal with very high voltages, special attention is paid to insulation.  The windings that deal with thousands of volts must resist arcing and other problems we do not see at home.

Finally, some transformers in electronic equipment are designed
for a task known as 'impedance matching', rather than for specific in/out voltages.  This function is explained in literature covering audio and radio topics.

While we traditionally interact with our computers with a keyboard and mouse, Mac OS X supports two other kinds of input device: a microphone and a tablet.

Operating a computer with your voice may seem like something out of a futuristic sci-fi movie. But the future is now, and Mac OS X lets you control certain functions with your voice. 

{{Mac Note Box|Mac OS X cannot handle speech dictation - it cannot write the things you say. It can only use your voice to activate certain commands.}}

&quot;Ink&quot; is the name of Apple's handwriting recognition technology, borrowed from the now-defunct Newton PDA. Now that it's been applied to Mac OS X, not only can you use your tablet to draw, but also to write.

Frequently we hear about malicious code causing a very vague problem called a '''stack overflow'''. This page is going to talk about what a stack overflow is, and how to prevent it.

== What It Is ==

A stack-based overflow attack is the act of putting too much information into a buffer in order to overwrite a return address and hijack the control flow.  The overwritten return address will, in most cases, point to some function in the programs address space. This function may already be defined in the application, or it can easily be defined by the hacker by injecting the code into the stack.

If we remember the chapter on the stack, we know a few fundamental facts about the stack when we enter into a new function:

#The stack &quot;grows&quot; downward.
#Local data is pushed on top of the stack.
#The old value for '''bp''' is stored below the local data
#The return address is stored below the old '''bp''' value

Consider the following buggy C code snippet:

 void MyFunction(void)
 {
    int a[100];
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i++)
    {
       a[i] = 0;
    }
    ...

What happens when i reaches 100?
As discussed earlier we know that local arrays are created on the stack. If we try to write above the upper bound of &quot;a&quot;, we will be overwriting the previous value on the stack: a[100] overwrites bp, a[101] overwrites the return address.

The program flow will then be redirected to the new address we placed. This is a stack overflow vulnerability, and it stems from bad programming where the programmer doesn't check the array bounds before writing data to the array.

== Spotting a Vulnerability ==

How do reversers spot a stack overflow vulnerability? Let's take a look at some example ASM code:

 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp, 100

This is a standard entry sequence, and we can see that this function is allocating 100 bytes of data on the stack. Either 25 integers worth of data, or an array of some sort. We examine the rest of the function, and see what kind of data it is:

 call _gets
 push eax
 push esp
 call _strcpy
 ...

Clearly we are accessing the data on the stack as an array, specifically an array of chars. The above assembly code fragment gets a text string from the console, and copies that data into the local variable on the stack.

Unfortunately the standard C library string functions we are using have a well-known vulnerability: they do not check the bounds of the input arguments. In fact, the '''&lt;string.h&gt;''' functions rarely even ask the programmer to supply the size of an array, or the maximum available memory size!

Some of the most common stack vulnerabilities stem from this fact. Offenders to look out for are '''strcpy''', '''strcat''' and '''sprintf''', functions whose output string arguments can be larger then the supplied buffer to hold them.

The local variable is only 100 chars (1 char = 1 byte) wide. What happens if we input a string 100 characters long? Remember, ASCIIZ strings are terminated by a null char (00h), that requires an extra slot from the array. That means that the 101st char will be a null byte, and the saved value for ebp will be lost.
Now imagine what would happen if we input 104 characters, or even 108 (enough to overwrite the return address). An attacker that inputs just the right values can redirect program execution to a malicious function that may help take over the computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medieval Mythology is a misnomer, since most of the myths where adopted from varied cultural backgrounds during medieval times, nevertheless there where some new creations and some ceased to be in common use, especially due to the influence of the Catholic Church. Some argue that Medieval Mythology is more appropriately classified as folklore with the tales of Lady Godiva, Peeping Tom, Pope Joan and Prester John. There is also the problem of clearly define the locality, even if it commonly refers and is restricted to Europe.

During the Medieval Period there was much development. Many of the European mythologies such as Scandinavian and Celtic Mythologies were still actively being shared and spread trough Europe. The regions of Scandinavia continued to hold their pagan beliefs well into the medieval period as the pressure to convert to Christianism final eroded away some of the myths.

:''See [[Wikibooks:Categories]] for a description of the Wikibooks-specific usage of categories.''

'''Categories''' are a software feature of MediaWiki which allows indexing of pages, files, templates and other categories (referred collectively from now on as simply ''pages''). Together with [[Help:Editing#Links|links]] and [[Help:Templates|templates]], categories help structure a book.

Pages are said to be &quot;members of a category&quot; if a category link is included in the text. Pages can be members of zero, one or more categories. Pages that are not a member of any category are said to be uncategorized. Pages should be a member of at least one category, with the exception of [[:Category:Categories]], so that all pages can be found through the category system. An automated list of all uncategorized pages is maintained at [[Special:UncategorizedPages]], [[Special:UncategorizedFiles]], [[Special:UncategorizedTemplates]] and [[Special:UncategorizedCategories]].

== Category pages ==
Categories have an editable part that typically contains at least a description of the category's purpose and category links to any related categories. If the editable part has not been created, links to the category will treat the category as a new page.

Categories which themselves are categorized are said to be a subcategory for another category. However categories allow more flexibility than simply a parent-child relationship.

Category pages may have a:

# '''Description section'''. This section is the only editable part and can include anything that is normally allowed on any other page.
# '''Related categories section''', which lists categories that were categorized using this category if any.
# '''Books and Pages section''', which list books and pages that were categorized using this category if any.
# '''Files section''', which lists files that were categorized using this category.

Adding &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOGALLERY__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a category causes categorized files to be shown only by their name in the '''Books and Pages''' section, rather than showing a preview for supported file formats.

Category pages list only 200 pages at a time.

== Adding pages ==
Each page lists the categories that it is a member of. Categories are listed in the order they first occurred. To add a page to a category, simply put &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:NAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in any page you are editing. Where NAME is the name of the category you want to add it to. This provides a link to the appropriate category page, which is in the &quot;Category&quot; namespace. Any number of categories may be added to a page and the page will be listed in all the categories. Categories can be added wherever you like in the text, but in general for the convenience of other editors, categories are added at bottom of content pages and at the top of discussion pages. Files can be categorized by adding categories to their description page.

If you want to link to a category without the current page being added to it, you should use the link form &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:NAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (where NAME is the category name). Note the extra &quot;&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; before Category.

Please familiarize yourself with [[Wikibooks:Categories]], before you start categorizing pages.

== Sorting pages ==
A &quot;sort key&quot; can be added that specifies where a page will appear within a category. This is done by using &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:NAME|SORT]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. For example &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Help|Category]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; would add a page to the ''Help'' category and sort it under the &quot;C&quot; heading after &quot;Can&quot; and before &quot;Catalog&quot;. Sort keys are case sensitive and even a space is recognized as a sort key. A sort key only affects how pages are ordered. A sort key does not change what name is used to display category and page links.

Without a sort key pages by default are sorted using their full page name, this includes any namespace they belong to. The default sort order can be overridden by adding &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{DEFAULTSORTKEY:SORT}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to pages where SORT is the name to sort pages under.

== Pitfalls and Gotchas ==
* Category pages currently cannot be [[WB:MOVE|moved]] or renamed.
* Pages added to a [[WB:REDIRECT|redirected]] category continue to show in the original category rather than the new category.
* Pages can only be added to a category once; only the last category link is used along with its sort key and the rest are ignored.
* Category listings may be outdated at times when categories contained within [[Help:Templates|templates]] are changed.
* &quot;[[WB:WLH|What links here]]&quot; only shows pages which include &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Category:NAME]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links. Note the extra &quot;&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.
* &quot;[[WB:RC|Related changes]]&quot; can't be reliably used to detect when pages are added or removed as it only shows changes to pages that are currently members of the category.

== conventions in a project ==

This page currently suggests

: ''&quot;Check the conventions in a project and make yourself familiar with the categories in use before assigning pages and subcategories to categories and before creating new categories.&quot;''

That sounds like good advice -- could someone please add a link to that advice, linking directly to the conventions used at this Wikibooks project?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome'''

==Overview==
*Disorder of growth characterized by macrosomia (large body size), macroglossia (large tongue), visceromegaly(large organs), omphalocele, neonatal hypoglycemia, ear creases/pits embryonal tumors (i.e., Wilms tumor (kidney tumor), hepatoblastoma (liver tumor), and less commonly neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma).

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of inheritance:
**Usually sporadic
**~85% have negative family history 15% have history consistent with AD inheritance with incomplete penetrance and preferential maternal transmission
**Believed to be a multigenic disorder caused by alterations in growth regulatory genes on chromosome 11p15
*Molecular genetics: 10-20% of patients have parental uniparental disomy (UPD), with two paternal copies of 11p15. Patients with UPD show somatic mosaicism, so the incidence of UPD is probably underestimated. UPD or mutation in gene found in 15-30%. &lt;1% have a chromosome abnormality involving 11p15

==Incidence==
*Incidence is 1 in 13,700, with equal occurrence in males and females
*Probably underestimate given potential mild undiagnosed cases

==Diagnosis==
*Primarily clinical
*No consensus diagnostic criteria
*Dx. generally accepted if have 3 findings (2 major 1 minor)

==Major Findings==
*Positive family history (one or more family members with a clinical diagnosis of BWS or a history or features suggestive of BWS)
*Macrosomia (traditionally defined as height and weight &gt;97th %)
*Anterior linear ear lobe creases/posterior helical ear pits
*Macroglossia
*Omphalocele (also called exomphalos), umbilical hernia
*Visceromegaly involving one or more intra-abdominal organs including liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas
*Embryonal tumor (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) in childhood
*Hemihyperplasia defined as asymmetric overgrowth of region(s) of the body
*Adrenocortical cytomegaly
*Renal abnormalities including structural abnormalities, nephromegaly, nephrocalcinosis
*Cleft palate (rare)

==Minor Findings==
*Polyhydramnios
*Prematurity
*Neonatal hypoglycemia
*Facial nevus flammeus (stork bite)
*Hemangioma
*Characteristic facies, including midfacial hypoplasia and infraorbital creases
*Cardiomegaly/structural cardiac anomalies/rarely cardiomyopathy
*Diastasis recti -
*Advanced bone age
*Monozygotic twinning. Monozygous twins with BWS are usually female and discordant; however, both male and female monozygous twins concordant for BWS have been reported, as well as monozygous male twins discordant for BWS
**Individuals presenting with fewer than three features, e.g., macroglossia and umbilical hernia or just hemihyperplasia, should be considered candidates for tumor surveillance

==Testing==
*High resolution chromosomes are recommended
*Molecular testing for those with normal karyotype can sometimes confirm dx. and better define recurrence risks
*(UPD) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of genes in the 11p15 region
*screening for p57 KIP2 mutations available only on a research basis by heteroduplex/SSCP analysis if positive gene is sequenced then confirmation of positive results in a clinical laboratory
*prenatal testing available
*ultrasound can sometimes detect macroglossia, increased growth for gestational age, omphalocele, minor signs such as polyhydramnios, large placenta
*genetic testing with amnio or CVS if mutation known or for UPD (although detection rate poor using UPD testing)

==Clinical Features==
(numbers vary)
*Prenatal findings: polyhydramnios, premature birth, fetal macrosomia, enlarged placenta, long umbilical cord
*20% infant mortality rate (mostly complications of prematurity, omphalocele, macroglossia, neonatal hypoglycemia (cardiomyopathy rare)
*Neonatal hypoglycemia (30-50% of babies) usually mild and transient
*Hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia/hypercholesterolemia and polycythemia less common
*Macrosomia (height and weight &gt;97th percentile) (87%) usually present at birth but can occur postnatally
*Most have rapid growth in early childhood but eventual height usually in upper range of normal
*Anterior linear ear lobe creases and/or posterior helical ear pits
*Macroglossia (usually at birth but may occur postnatal)
*Abdominal wall defects common (omphalocele, umbilical hernia, diastasis recti)
*Visceromegaly involving one or more intra-abdominal organs including liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas
*Tumors both malignant and benign -- Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, (most common)
*Overall incidence of tumors is 7.5% (5-10%), but uncommon after 8 years old
*Hemihyperplasia (25%) usually noticed at birth, but may be more evident w/ growth (segmental or selected organs)
*Adrenocortical cytomegaly
*Renal abnormalities (structural abnormalities, nephromegaly, nephrocalcinosis, cystic changes)
*Cardiomegaly (between 4-17% of patients)
*Advanced bone age
*Midfacial hypoplasia and infraorbital creases

==Development==
*Usually normal unless chromosome abnormality or birth complication
*Mental retardation/developmental delay (if a chromosome abnormality is found)

==Age of Onset, Natural History, and Life Span==
*Age of onset is birth. There is a good prognosis for long-term health and development, but 20% will die in the perinatal period of complications.
*Natural History: Macroglossia and macrosomia are usually present at birth, although postnatal onset can occur. Neonatal hypoglycemia is common. Hemihyperplasia becomes more apparent as the child grows and may be limited to only one side of the body. Although cardiomegaly is common, it usually resolves on its own. Childhood malignancies and renal anomalies pose large health threats and mortality risks. After childhood, the complications for patients with BWS are infrequent.

==Surveillance, Management, and Treatment Options==
*Newborns should be screened for hypoglycemia within the first seven days of life. Early treatment of hypoglycemia minimizes CNS complications.
*Patients with abdominal wall defects may undergo surgical repair
*Jaw grows and tongue growth usually slows down but…
*Severe macroglossia may benefit from surgery (between two and four years of age).
*If macroglossia should be followed by a craniofacial team
*If hemihyperplasia significant should be followed by an orthopedist.
*Order renal ultrasound
*If renal anomalies refer to nephrologist
*Once a patient is eight years, may be monitored with an annual renal ultrasound until adolescence
*Patients should also have an abdominal ultrasound every three months until eight years of age to screen for embryonal tumors.
*Baseline MRI and CT examination of abdomen is also recommended
*Serum AFP part of screening protocol for first few years of life (screen for hepatoblastoma and risk for it drops off significantly after 3 years)
*Periodic chest x-ray and urinary VMA and VHA assays to screen for neuroblastoma have been suggested, but have not been incorporated into most screening protocols because of their low yield and fortunately they are rare
*Comprehensive cardiac eval prior to any surgery or if cardiac problem suspected

==Recurrence Risks==
*Unknown if no identifiable etiology, but probably low
*Very low if paternal UPD of 11p15 is present (normal karyotype and neg. fam hx)
*Up to 50% if p57 KIP2 mutation present in parent
*Positive family history normal karyotype up to 50%
*Cyptogenetically detected maternal translocation or inversion may be up to 50% with preferential maternal transmission

==Risk to Sibs of a Patient with BWS Based on Family History and Genetic Characteristics==
*% of Patients with BWS

==Characteristics==
*Risk to Sibs of Patient with BWS
*Prenatal Test Availability / Test Type
*~85%
*Negative family history, normal karyotype 1, 2
*Unknown but probably low if no identifiable molecular etiology
*No
*Very low if paternal UPD of 11p15 is present
*Up to 50% if p57 KIP2 mutation is present in a parent
*Yes, if p57 KIP2 mutation analysis confirmed by clinical laboratory
*~10-15%
*Positive family history, normal karyotype 2
*Up to 50%
*Yes, only if p57 KIP2 mutation analysis documented in a clinical laboratory or linkage analysis is available (see above caveats)
*&lt;1%
*Cytogenetically detected maternal 11p15 translocation or inversion
*May be as high as 50% with preferential maternal transmission
*Yes / karyotype
*&lt;1%
*Cytogenetically detected paternal 11p15 duplication
*Not defined
*&lt;1%
*Monozygous twins
*Low
*No
*10-20% of patients with sporadically occurring BWS have paternal uniparental disomy of 11p15
*5-10% of all patients with BWS with a normal karyotype have identifiable mutations in p57 KIP2
**table taken from geneclinics/genetests

==Differential Diagnoses==
*Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome: patients have macrosomia, visceromegaly, macroglossia, and renal cysts, but also exhibit coarse features, cleft lip, a high incidence of cardiac abnormalities, supernumerary nipples, polydactyly, and skeletal anomalies.
*Perlman syndrome: patients have macrosomia, MR, and renal tumors, but also have a characteristic facial appearance different from that of BWS.
*Costello syndrome: this syndrome resembles BWS only in the neonatal period, since both are overgrowth syndromes. Children with Costello syndrome have very coarse facial features and failure to thrive.
*Isolated hemihyperplasia - increase for tumors (5.9%) and offered tumor surveillance
*Or hemihyperplasia associated with other syndromes (proteus, klippel-Trenauny-Weber, NF1)

A '''table''' is an arrangement of columns and rows used to organize and position data. Tables are useful for this purpose and there are many different styles and tricks that can be used to customize each. This page gives you information about syntax to build tables in Wikibooks.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

==Using the toolbar==
[[File:English Wikibooks advanced Vector toolbar.png|frame|center|Vector toolbar]]

To automatically insert a table, click [[File:Vector toolbar insert table button.png|alt=(Insert a table)|link=]] on the [[Help:Editing#Edit toolbar|edit toolbar]].

The following text is inserted when the button is clicked and the default values are accepted:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header text !! Header text !! Header text
|-
| Example || Example || Example
|-
| Example || Example || Example
|-
| Example || Example || Example
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header text !! Header text !! Header text
|-
| Example || Example || Example
|-
| Example || Example || Example
|-
| Example || Example || Example
|}

The sample text (&quot;Header text&quot; or &quot;Example&quot;) is to be replaced with actual data.  The number of columns and rows can be customized when working with the initial dialog box that appears after clicking the &quot;insert table&quot; button.

 |-
 | &amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt; || &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 |}
 |}

If you use single bars, then what might appear to be the first cell is in fact a format modifier applied to the cell, and the rest of your &quot;cells&quot; will be merged into one:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{| style=&quot;border:1px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|format modifier (not displayed)&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''|'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;These all &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''|'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;(including the pipes)&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''|'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;go into &lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''|'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;the first cell&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which is probably not what you want:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| format modifier (not displayed)|These all |(including the pipes)|go into |the first cell
|}

However, the format modifier is useful:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{| style=&quot;border:1px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| Cell 1 (no modifier—not aligned)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;| style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; | Cell 2 (right aligned)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Cell 1 (no modifier&amp;nbsp;— not aligned)
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; | Cell 2 (right aligned)
|}

Just remember: no more than 2 single pipes on a line!

A row of '''column headings''' is identified by using &quot;! scope=&quot;col&quot; |&quot; instead of &quot;|&quot;, and using &quot;!! scope=&quot;col&quot; |&quot; instead of &quot;||&quot;. Header cells typically render differently from regular cells, depending on the browser. They are often rendered in a bold font and centered.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|+&lt;/nowiki&gt; The table's caption
 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 1''' 
 '''! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 2''' 
 '''! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 3'''&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 | Cell 1 || Cell 2 || Cell 3
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 | Cell A
 | Cell B
 | Cell C
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The first cell of a row is identified as a '''row heading''' by starting the line with &quot;! scope=&quot;row&quot; |&quot; instead of &quot;|&quot;, and starting subsequent data cells on a new line.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|+&lt;/nowiki&gt; The table's caption
 ! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 1 
 ! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 2 
 ! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 3
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading 1'''&lt;/span&gt;
 | Cell 2 || Cell 3
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading A'''&lt;/span&gt;
 | Cell B
 | Cell C
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Optional '''parameters''' can modify the behavior of cells, rows, or the entire table.  For instance, a border could be added to the table:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a63;&quot;&gt;'''border=&quot;1&quot;'''&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|+&lt;/nowiki&gt; The table's caption
 ! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 1 
 ! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 2 
 ! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 3
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 ! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading 1
 | Cell 2 || Cell 3
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 ! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading A
 | Cell B
 | Cell C
 &lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The final table would display like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+ The table's caption
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 1 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 2 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Column heading 3
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading 1
| Cell 2 || Cell 3
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading A
| Cell B
| Cell C
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Each row must have the same number of cells as the other rows, so that the number of columns in the table remains consistent. For empty cells, use the non-breaking space &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; as content to ensure that the cells are displayed. To show a visible pipe in a cell, use &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#124;&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Simple example ==
Both of these generate the same output.  Choose a style based on the number of cells in each row and the total text inside each cell.

The wiki markup code:
&lt;pre&gt;
{|
| A
| B
|-
| C
| D
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
{|
| A || B
|-
| C || D
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

What it looks like in your browser:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{|
|-
| A
| B
|-
| C
| D
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

== Standard formatting ==
You can add &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; next to the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at the start of your table to have the standard formatting applied that applies a background color to table headings and adds borders between cells and around the table.

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow: auto;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot;
|+ Multiplication table
|-
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | × 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 1 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 2 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 3
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 1
| 1 || 2 || 3
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 2
| 2 || 4 || 6
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 3
| 3 || 6 || 9
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 4
| 4 || 8 || 12
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 5
| 5 || 10 || 15
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

and what it looks like in your browser:

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot;
|+ Multiplication table
|-
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | × 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 1 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 2 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 3
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 1
| 1 || 2 || 3
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 2
| 2 || 4 || 6
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 3
| 3 || 6 || 9
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 4
| 4 || 8 || 12
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 5
| 5 || 10 || 15
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

==Color==
The way of specifying color of text and background for a single cell are as follows.

The wiki markup code:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{|
| style=&quot;background: red; color: white&quot; | abc
| def
| style=&quot;background: red; color: white&quot; | ghi
| jkl
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

What it looks like in your browser:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{|
| style=&quot;background: red; color: white&quot; | abc
| def
| style=&quot;background: red; color: white&quot; | ghi
| jkl
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Like other parameters, colors can also be specified for a whole row or the whole table; parameters for a row override the value for the table, and those for a cell override those for a row.  (Note that there is no easy way to specify a color for a whole column—each cell in the column must be individually specified.):

The wiki markup code:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| style=&quot;background: yellow; color: green&quot;
|-
| abc || def || ghi
|- style=&quot;background: red; color: white&quot;
| jkl || mno || pqr
|-
| stu || style=&quot;background: silver&quot; | vwx || yz
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

What it looks like in your browser:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| style=&quot;background: yellow; color: green&quot;
|-
| abc || def || ghi
|- style=&quot;background: red; color: white&quot;
| jkl || mno || pqr
|-
| stu || style=&quot;background: silver&quot; | vwx || yz
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

To make the table blend in with the background, use &lt;code&gt;style=&quot;background: none;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;style=&quot;background: transparent;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

To force a cell to match one of the default colors of the &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, use &lt;code&gt;style=&quot;background: #f2f2f2&quot;&lt;/code&gt; for the darker header, and &lt;code&gt;style=&quot;background: #f9f9f9&quot;&lt;/code&gt; for the lighter body.

== Width, height ==
The width and height of the whole table can be specified, as well as the height of a row. To specify the width of a column one can specify the width of an arbitrary cell in it. If the width is not specified for all columns, and/or the height is not specified for all rows, then there is some ambiguity, and the result depends on the browser.

The wiki markup code:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| style=&quot;width: 75%; height: 200px;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| abc || def || ghi
|- style=&quot;height:100px;&quot;
| jkl || style=&quot;width:200px;&quot; | mno || pqr
|-
| stu || vwx || yz
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

What it looks like in your browser:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| style=&quot;width:75%; height:200px;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| abc || def || ghi
|- style=&quot;height:100px;&quot;
| jkl || style=&quot;width:200px;&quot; | mno || pqr
|-
| stu || vwx || yz
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

===Setting column widths===
To force column widths to specific requirements, rather than accepting the width of the widest text element in a column's cells, follow this example. Note that [[w:word wrap|wrap-around of text]] is forced.

The wiki markup code:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | Name
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:225px;&quot; | Effect
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:225px;&quot; | Games Found In
|-
| Poké Ball || Regular Poké Ball || All Versions
|-
| Great Ball || Better than a Poké Ball || All Versions
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | Name
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:225px;&quot; | Effect
! scope=&quot;col&quot; style=&quot;width:225px;&quot; | Games Found In
|-
|Poké Ball || Regular Poké Ball || All Versions
|-
|Great Ball || Better than a Poké Ball || All Versions
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

To set column widths in a table without headers, specify the width in the first cell for each column, like this:

&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | This column is 100 pixels wide
| style=&quot;width:200px;&quot; | This column is 200 pixels  wide
| style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; | This column is 300 pixels wide
|-
| blah || blih || bluh
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width: 100px;&quot; | This column is 100 pixels wide
| style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; | This column is 200 pixels wide
| style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot; | This column is 300 pixels wide
|-
| blah || blih || bluh
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

== Setting borders ==
Table borders default to a complex shaded double-line (the default in HTML); however, those borders can be set to a thin solid line by using a style-parameter (&lt;tt&gt;style=&quot;border:&amp;nbsp;1px&amp;nbsp;solid&amp;nbsp;darkgray&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;), as in the following (''Note: if you intend to use the 'cellpadding' or 'cellspacing' options along with a border, you MUST use this format''):

&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid darkgray;&quot;
! style=&quot;width: 140px;&quot; | Left
! style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot; | Middle
! style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; | Right
|- style=&quot;border:none;&quot;
| [[File:StarIconBronze.png|120px]]
| [[File:StarIconGold.png|120px|Caption when mouse-over image]]
| [[File:StarIconGreen.png|120px|Green stellar icon]]
|- style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
| Bronze star || Gold star || Green star
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the bottom-row texts are centered by &lt;tt&gt;style=&quot;text-align:&amp;nbsp;center;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; while star-images were not centered.

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid darkgrey; margin-left: 4em;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width: 140px;&quot; | Left
! style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot; | Middle
! style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot; | Right
|- style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| [[File:StarIconBronze.png|120px]]
| [[File:StarIconGold.png|120px|Caption when mouse-over image]]
| [[File:StarIconGreen.png|120px|Green stellar icon]]
|- style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
| Bronze star || Gold star || Green star
|}

As long as the [[WB:FILE|files]] omit the parameter &quot;thumb&quot; they will not show borders. The border color &quot;darkgray&quot; matches that seen using &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; above; however, it could be any color name (such as &lt;tt&gt;style=&quot;border:&amp;nbsp;1px&amp;nbsp;solid&amp;nbsp;darkgreen;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;) or use a hex-color (such as: #DDCCBB).  See [[w:Web colors|Web colors]] for information on hex-colors, which allow you to specify any shade you like.

A column format-specifier (enclosed in &quot;|...|&quot;) can have a style-parameter to set borders on each cell, as follows:

&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid darkgray;&quot;
! style=&quot;width: 140px;&quot; | Left
! style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot; | Middle
! style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;| Right
|- style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
| style=&quot;border: 1px solid blue;&quot;|
[[File:StarIconBronze.png|120px]]
| style=&quot;border: 1px solid #777777;&quot;|
[[File:StarIconGold.png|120px|Caption when mouse-over image]]
| style=&quot;border: 1px solid #22AA55;&quot;|
[[File:StarIconGreen.png|120px|Green stellar icon]]
|- style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|Bronze star || Gold star || Green star
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note only the image cells, here, have individual borders, not the text.
{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid darkgrey; margin-left:4em;&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;width: 140px;&quot;|Left || style=&quot;width: 150px;&quot;|Middle || style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;|Right
|- style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
| style=&quot;border: 1px solid blue;&quot;|
[[File:StarIconBronze.png|120px]]
| style=&quot;border: 1px solid #777;&quot;|
[[File:StarIconGold.png|120px|Caption when mouse-over image]]
| style=&quot;border: 1px solid #2a5;&quot;|
[[File:StarIconGreen.png|120px|Green stellar icon]]
|- style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|Bronze star || Gold star || Green star
|}

The lower hex-colors (such as: #616161) are closer to black. Typically, all borders in a table would be one specific color.

== Vertical alignment ==
By default data in tables is vertically aligned to the middle of the cell, which results in layouts like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; margin-left: 6em;&quot;
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;width: 10%;&quot;| Row heading
| style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; |A longer piece of text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
| style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot; |short text
|}

To fix this, apply &lt;tt&gt;style=&quot;vertical-align:&amp;nbsp;top;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; to the rows (unfortunately it is necessary to apply this individually to every single row). For example:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! scope=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;width: 10%;&quot; | Row heading
| style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; | A longer piece of text. Lorem ipsum...
| style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot; | short text
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Row heading
| Excepteur sint occaecat...
| short text
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; margin-left: 6em;&quot;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;
! scope=&quot;row&quot; style=&quot;width: 10%;&quot; | Row heading
| style=&quot;width: 70%;&quot; | A longer piece of text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
| style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot; | short text
|}

== Floating table ==
The wiki markup coding:
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
This paragraph is before the table.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit
amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod...

{| style=&quot;float: right;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Col 1, row 1
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Col 2, row 1 (and 2)
| Col 3, row 1
|-
| Col 1, row 2
| Col 3, row 2
|}

Note the floating-table to the right.

This paragraph is after the table.  The text in column 2
will span both rows due to format specifier &lt;tt&gt;&quot;rowspan=2&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; so there
is no coding for &quot;Col 2&quot; in the 2nd row, just: Col 1 &amp; Col 3.
&lt;/pre&gt;

What it looks like in your browser:
&lt;div style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

This paragraph is before the table.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit
amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod...

{| style=&quot;float: right; margin:5px 0px;&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Col 1, row 1
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Col 2, row 1 (and 2)
| Col 3, row 1
|-
| Col 1, row 2
| Col 3, row 2
|}

Note the floating-table to the right.

This paragraph is after the table.  The text in column 2
will span both rows due to format specifier &quot;rowspan=2&quot; so there
is no coding for &quot;Col 2&quot; in the 2nd row, just: Col 1 &amp; Col 3.
&lt;/div&gt;

== Centering tables ==
Centered tables can be achieved, but they will not &quot;float&quot;; that is to say, no text will appear to either side. The trick is &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{| style=&quot;margin:&amp;nbsp;1em&amp;nbsp;auto&amp;nbsp;1em&amp;nbsp;auto;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Wiki markup'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ '''Cells left-aligned, table centered'''
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | Duis 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | aute 
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | irure
|-
| dolor  || in reprehenderit || in voluptate velit
|-
| esse cillum dolore || eu fugiat nulla || pariatur.
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''What it looks like in your browser'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ '''Cells left-aligned, table centered'''
! Duis || aute || irure
|-
| dolor  || in reprehenderit || in voluptate velit
|-
| esse cillum dolore || eu fugiat nulla || pariatur.
|}

== Collapsible tables ==
You can create a table that will collapse and be hidden.  Add &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;collapsible&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; to the top of a table or add &quot;collapsible&quot; after &quot;wikitable&quot; to enable collapsing behavior.  By default, a collapsible table will begin collapsed.  To change this, include the additional class 'selected'. You must include a header row, where the control to expand and collapse will be displayed. Example:

&lt;pre style=&quot;display: inline-block;&quot;&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable collapsible selected&quot;
! Header
|-
| Content which starts shown
|-
| Click the header row to collapse
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Gives:

{| class=&quot;wikitable collapsible selected&quot;
|-
! Header
|-
| Content which starts shown
|-
| Click the header row to collapse
|}

==Sortable tables==
Tables can be made sortable by adding &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;sortable&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Since this can be very useful, it is wise to keep the possibilities and limitations of this feature in mind when designing a table. For example:

* Do not divide a table into sections by subheaders spanning several rows. Instead, an extra column can be made showing the content of these headers on each row, in a short form.
* Do not have elements spanning several columns; instead, again, repeat the content on each row, in a short form.
* In a column of numbers, do not put text such as &quot;ca.&quot; in front of a number-it will sort like zero. Do not put text after the number, and do not put a range of numbers.  Instead, put these texts in a separate column.

A long form of abbreviated content can be put as legend outside the table.

Shouldn't this be titled &quot;tagalog&quot; as there is no national language of the filipines?

&gt;There's an entire literature of debate on that. To dismiss Filipino (a language struggling in its infancy and helped along by practically nobody) so summarily is to insult the hours of manpower spent in analyzing the issue. There should at least be an explanation in the &quot;Filipino&quot; page ''why'' there was an effort to create a national language, ''what'' had been done so far (since the 60s), what is ''being'' done, and why the majority of internet posters (english-speaking Filipinos, mostly) ''believe'' that Filipino has failed/is failing/will fail. What do you think?

::: Wikipedia distinguishes between the two basically by saying that Filipino is a standardized tagalog. You are right in that there should be a link to wikipedias' Filipino Language article. But I think this article should stay titled Tagalog, as it would be much harder for a wikibook to teach the standardized Filipino as it is defined by the Philippine government, and it would be less practical.

I believe that Tagalog is the primary dialect in the more industrialized areas of the Philippines such as Manila. However, you would be amiss if you were not to recognize the myriad number of dialects employed in any number of regions in the Philippines; I speak primarily of the Visayan and Iloilo dialects. However, I am certain that there are many more in common and often primary usage.  While many may consider this as an analog to the dialects of American English (ie: Texan slang, Brooklyn slang, Ebonics, and other regional differences); that would be a false analogy, as (for example) Visayan and Pilipino are entirely incompatible and require separate learning.  So I agree with lotusduck that Tagalog should be taught initially, however there should be an addendum listing other dialects, and possibly some primers on those as well.

== Lesson arrangement ==

I'm looking for suggestions on how to group existing lessons and future lessons.  Help would be welcomed.  Thanks!  --[[User:Akira123323|Akira123323]] 09:11, 11 February 2006 (UTC)
:Though I don't assume that arrangement within a lesson was what you meant (as opposed to arrangement of lessons), I will address that here. I should think that vocabulary before dialogues. In my foreign language studies thus far, vocabulary comes first, is studied briefly, and is cemented as dialogues are expressed. I also think that the dialogues should be expanded; for example, in Lesson 1, there are more greetings than merely &quot;how are you&quot;, such as say &quot;How is so-and-so relation&quot;, etc. Perhaps these could be added? Also, before I checked the main arrangement I did rearrange vocabulary with dialogue in Lesson 1. Is it more logical? Additionally, using accent marks to indicate stress/glottals would be useful, especially to a learner.
::I'm a native Tagalog speaker, and I want to contribute to this wikibook. I'll start with the accent marks. I'm going to place accent marks on words to indicate how they are pronounced in spoken Tagalog (or at least, how people in Metro Manila pronounce them). --[[User:perryv|perryv]] 15:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
To address arrangement of lessons, I can provide (scanned or typed) the table of contents within my Tagalog guide - to be used as a reference, perhaps. [[User:68.110.119.132|68.110.119.132]] 06:06, 17 June 2006 (UTC)
:Feel free to do so, both of you.  Be bold in improving the Tagalog Wikibook.  --[[User:Akira123323|Akira123323]] 12:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
:I have added some entries. Feel free to edit them as you deem fit.--[[User:Jeomaxxters|Jeomaxxters]] 18:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

== Proposed rename ==

I'd like to change all the page names in this book so that they all start with &quot;Tagalog/&quot;. This would make this book consistent with most wikibooks, plus make it clear to all readers which pages form part of this book. I trust this change will be non-controversial, but note it hear to allow for comments before implementing it, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:48, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

Just combed through, fixing some spelling errors, i.e. &quot;knowlage&quot; in Creating an Outline and easing up on some exclamation point action.

I love the idea of this book. I will read it if it seems useful.

Good idea.

Dan Brown is given as an example of a thorough researcher. He could equally be used as an example of why research is necessary. I am an Air Traffic Controller, and his description of the flight in the aircraft in &quot;The da Vinci Code&quot; was laughable. It made it brutally obvious that he never bothered to carry out even the most basic research about flying or flight planning and Air Traffic procedures. The book was ruined for me from that point on. If he couldn't be bothered to read, he shouldn't have bothered to write that section.

I agree that the title should be merged as suggested because you might think this was a chapter about fiction books in general.--[[User:God&amp;#39;sGirl94|God&amp;#39;sGirl94]] ([[User talk:God&amp;#39;sGirl94|talk]]) 20:04, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

== Latest Edits ==

I found this book interesting and I have edited it as I went through. Perhaps a little more detail on developing a character could be very useful and, of course, greater information on developing a plot. Thanks, Karl H.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Beta-Thalassemia'''
(Also called Cooley's Anemia, Beta-Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that manifests as an absent or decreased production of normal hemoglobin.)

==Genetics==
*Caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the Hemoglobin beta chain (HBB)
*Normal hemoglobin has two alpha and two beta peptide chains. Beta-Thalassemia results from reduced synthesis of the hemoglobin beta chain. This disorder is caused by mutations in the beta chain of the hemoglobin molecule.
*Chromosomal locus of the HBB gene is 11p15.5
*Over 200 different HBB gene mutations are known. In each at risk population, though, four to ten mutations usually account for a large majority of HBB disease-causing alleles.
*HBB gene is 1.6Kb and has 3 exons

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Overall gene frequency is 1/300
*B-thal is more prevalent in Meditarranean, Middle Eastern, Transcaucasus, Central Asia, Indian and Far Eastern populations.
*Ex.: People with Mediterranean ancestry (Greek or Italian) have a 1/30 carrier risk

==Inheritance/Risks==
*Autosomal recessive inheritance
*Parents of an affected child are heterzygotes. They are clinically asymptomatic but may be slightly anemic.They are referred to as having beta-thalassemia minor.

==Beta-Thalassemia Major==
*Patients present with severe anemia and hepatosplenomegaly
*Patients with thalassemia major are usually picked up within the first 2 yrs of life. Babies may be pale, fussy, have poor appetite and infections
*If untreated, spleen, liver and heart become enlarged and bones can become thin and brittle. Buildup of iron may cause heart failure in teens or 20s.affected children have failure to thrive and shortened life expectancy. Many other complications can occur without treatment. Patients usually die before 30.
*Treatment involves chelation therapy (which removes excess iron) and blood transfusions

==Thalassemia Intermedia==
*Patients present at later age and have more mild anemia
*Liver and spleen are enlarged and iron overload may still occur
*Rarely requires transfusions

==Thalassemia Minor or Thalassemia Trait==
*Refers to carriers of one abnormal beta gene
*Sometimes results in anemia
*Few or no symptoms (thalassemia minima)

==Diagnosis==
*Red blood cell indices
**Shows microcytic anemia (low mean corpuscular volume) and reduced content of Hb per red cell (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin).
**Normal level of hemoglobin for males is 14-18 g/dl and 12-16 g/dl for females. Affected individuals have hemoglobin levels less than 7 g/dl and carrier level is 11-14 g/dl.
*Peripheral blood smear
**Affected patients have microcytosis, hypochromia, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis and nucleated red blood cells (erythroblasts).
*Hemoglobin analysis
**Identifies amount and type of hemoglobin present
**This disorder characterized by decreased amounts of hemoglobin A (HbA)
*Bone marrow examination
**In beta-thalassemia patients, bone marrow is extremely cellular due to erythroid hyperplasia
*Molecular Genetic testing
**Mutations are detected by a number of different PCR-based procedures. The most common are reverse dot blot analysis or primer-specific amplification, with a set of probes complementary to the most common mutations in the population from which the patient originated.
**There are known common mutations for Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Indian, Thai, Chinese, and African/ African American populations.
**Clinical testing is available

==Carrier Testing==
*Carriers identified by red blood cell indices, hemoglobin analysis and mutation analysis.
*Family members of an affected person, gamete donors and members of at-risk ethnic groups should consider carrier detection.
*Hematologic testing has several limitations: silent mutations, coinheritance of other thalassemias, and confusion with Alpha-thalassemia.
*Prenatal testing is available for couples who are both carriers and their mutations have been identified. Use CVS or amniocentesis.

==Treatment==
*Transfusion therapy
**Corrects the anemia, suppresses erythropoiesis and inhibits increased gastrointestinal absorption of iron
**Usually given every 2-3 weeks
*Chelation therapy
**Used to maintain iron levels below critical values
**DFO (desferrioxamine B)
*Bone marrow transplantation from an HLA identical sibling is an alternative

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bloom Syndrome'''
(Also known as Bloom-Torre-Mackacek syndrome, BS, Levi's Type Dwarfism, Short Stature and Facial Telangiectasis)

==Introduction==
*Acknowledge any prior contact with patient
*Assess concerns and questions of the patient and his/her family
*Assess knowledge of this condition and why the patient thinks he or she was referred to genetics
*Patient's Medical History
*Family Medical History and Pedigree

==Genetic Etiology==
*Mode of Inheritance: Autosomal recessive
*Chromosome Location: BLM gene mutation at locus 15q26.1
*Molecular Genetics: A cytogenetic diagnosis is made via increased rate of chromosome breakage and sister chromatid exchange

==Incidence and Carrier Frequency==
*Since this is an inherited disorder, an affected parent has a 25% chance of passing on this syndrome to a child. Fifty percent of an affected parent's children will be carriers for this disease (carriers are usually asymptomatic).
*Bloom syndrome is an incredibly rare disorder, with approximately 140 cases having been reported. It affects males slightly more than females. It is more prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, with an estimated carrier rate of 1 in 104.

==Clinical Features==
*Short stature with normal body proportions
*Multiple small, dilated blood vessels on the face (facial telangiectasia) and on other light-exposed areas
*Photosensitivity
*Susceptibility to infections due to immune system defect
*IUGR
*Abnormally high-pitched voice
*Dental anomalies
*Prominent ears
*Cysts at the base of the spine
*Polydactyly
*Acanthosis nigricans on parts of the body other than the face

==Natural History==
*As life progresses, patients with Bloom syndrome have an increased rate of malignant tumors, especially leukemia and squamous cell cancer of the skin. Diarrhea and vomiting are also common. Frequent infections and problems associated with short stature are also present.
*Life expectancy is variable. Death is often a result of cancer.
*Preterm labor has been shown to occur in women with Bloom syndrome. They also have a shorter reproductive span and reduced fertility. Men with Bloom syndrome are sterile.

==Testing==
*Chromosome analysis is typically done to detect Bloom syndrome. Most often, chromosome fragility testing is performed to make a cytogenetic diagnosis.

==Treatment==
*Affected individuals should use sunscreen and should avoid direct contact with sunlight. Patients should have regular evaluations by dermatology, general medicine, genetics, and oncology. If an infection occurs, it should be treated aggressively with antibiotics.
*Research on therapies is ongoing.
*Psychosocial Issues
*Affected patients and their family members may react initially to diagnosis with shock, frustration, denial, anger, fear, sadness, depression, guilt, and loss. The fact that patients with this syndrome require constant medical follow-up may be overwhelming for patients and families. Affected patients may have low self-esteem due to facial erythemia and their photosensitivity may make individuals (especially children) resentful of their condition, since it limits outdoor activities. Reproductive issues should also be considered with a genetic counselor, depending on the age of the patient when diagnosis is made.

== '''XML Web Voice''' ==

=Learning Objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, you will 
* understand the potential of XML based web delivery of audio text files
* understand the use of SSML (Synthetic Speech Markup Language), the XML subset of tags 


== The Problem: ==

How can text files of any content a user chooses be transferred to the user in such a form that the end user can listen to them on a piece of hardware that has mobile internet capability? An example would be someone listening to a news report of any topic or from any region just by converting text files which already exist on the internet to a sythesized voice for playing on a mobile device in an automobile.

Existing Technology: 
There are several technologies available that work with voice data. Voice XML provides a framework for transferring voice data between entities. It is used for interactive voice triggered tools. This technology is used extensively for phone menus and automated help by companies with customer service or other areas of high call volume needs. 

Internet radio exists and provides a user with music or other programming that is broadcast throughout the internet. This programming is not up to the choice of the end user other than to select the internet station to listen to. 

Software exists that can convert any text file into an audio file.  Text files can be converted to audio files using software provided in the Windows or Mac operating systems or very inexpensive stand-alone software (an example is TextAloud). TextAloud allows a user to modify the voice, the pace of reading and other features. Free versions of it are available online. These systems can modify the voice in multiple ways to the personal taste of a user. These systems do not make the files available over the internet for users to search and listen to.

== The Potential: ==
 
With the right combination of XML technology, mobile communication services and software/hardware  that already exists the idea of internet radio could be opened to a much larger volume of content than currently exists. Most internet radio is in the form of music files and programed radio content. The choices of internet radio could be extended to include any existing text file which would include news reports, government documents, educational materials and many forms of official records. A business example would be a travelling salesman briefing himself on a client’s buying history by listening to a file in his car on the way to a sales call with the customer. Another example includes language conversion software that already exists that could enable a person in a distant county to listen and learn about technology that is being developed somewhere else. 


== Requirements: ==

The technology would require three areas to come together to make the process work. 
1. The XML technology must include a set of agreed upon XML tags for transferring files between content generators/distrubutors and users. 
2.  The mobile communications services must be able to deliver the data in a usuable format to an end user system. 
3.  Hardware and software must be able to make use of the documents sent and play them for a user. Included in this is the further development of a voice processing browser.

The second and third requirements are outside the scope of this chapter on XML. However, work is being done on them. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is currently working on the Mobile Web Initiative which would set some standards for software vendors, content providers, hardware (handset) manufacturers, browser developers and mobile service operators. One suggestion being considered is a maximum page weight of 10K (a typical magazine article fits within that range). The availability of advertising being embedded and what form it would take is under debate. Delivery protocol is expected to be http. The connection for a mobile device can be slow but the audio files do not have to stream. Current vendors involved include Nokia, Ericsson, HP, France Telecom and Opera.

The first requirement would include a set of XML tags that all text file content generators (such as news services, governments, educational institutions and official records generators) could use to generate files of their content. Thus their content could be accessed and stored in a searchable database and requested for downloading and playback at any time from anywhere that supports a mobile browser device. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


== The Existing Tag Set: ==

There is an existing set of XML tags called SSML (Synthesized Speech Markup Language). This set enables control of enough aspects of speech generation that a personable voice can be generated and manipulated by a user. A Text-to-Speech system uses the tags to take a text file and generate audible text in a voice.

'''Document Structure, Text Processing and Pronunciation Elements and Attributes:'''

''speak - Root Element'' 
	''xml:lang - Attribute'' 
                 Language (indicates the natural language of the file, such as “en-US”); this 
                 is preferred to be indicated only on the voice element so as to eliminate 
                 changes in a voice in the midst of a voice file.
	''xml:base - Attribute'' 
                 base URI Attribute (optional)

'''EXAMPLE:'''

&lt;speak version=&quot;1.0&quot;
         xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis&quot;
         xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
         xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis
                   http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/synthesis.xsd&quot;
         xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;
  ... the body ...

&lt;/speak&gt;


''lexicon - Element''  
        for pronunciation, (an empty element)
''meta - Element''
        (an empty element); includes a string that contains some information about the  
        ensuing data; it can declare a content type of “http” in the case of a file that 
        doesn’t have generated header fields from the originating server.
''metadata - Element''
        can provide broader information about data as it accesses a metadata schema.
''p - Element''
        text structure, represents a paragraph. It can only contain the following elements:   
        audio, break, emphasis, mark, phoneme, prosody, say-as, sub, s, voice.
''s - Element''
        text structure, Element; represents a sentence. It can only contain the following   
        elements: audio, break, emphasis, mark, phoneme, prosody, say-as, sub, voice.

''say-as - Element'' 
        available attributes: interpret-as, format, and detail phoneme with interpret-as being 
        the only required one. The tag set may only contain text to be rendered by a voice    
        synthesizer. This tag helps a browser to know more about the manner in which the  
        enclosed text is to be voiced.
	''format - Attribute'' 
                this attribute gives additional hints as to the rendering of voiced text.	''detail - Attribute''
                this attribute is for indicating the level of detail to be applied to voiced  
                text. An example would be a special form of emphasis such as the reading of 
                computer code in a block of text.
''Phoneme - Element''
        a pronunciation indicator for the text to speech engine. The engine does not render 
        the contents of the tag, thus the tag can be empty. The attributes for the tag provide 
        what the engine will use to help with language specific pronunciation factors.     
        However, any text between the tag set will be rendered on screen in  a visual browser  
        for hearing impaired users. This tag can only contain text, no elements.
        ''alphabet - attribute'' 
                for Phoneme, used to specify a particular version of an alphabet, optional
        ''ph - Attribute''
                a required attribute for phoneme, used to specify the string to be pronounced.
''EXAMPLE:''

&lt;speak version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis&quot;
         xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
         xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis
                   http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/synthesis.xsd&quot;
         xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;
  &lt;phoneme alphabet=&quot;ipa&quot; ph=&quot;t&amp;#x259;mei&amp;#x325;&amp;#x27E;ou&amp;#x325;&quot;&gt; pomegranate &lt;/phoneme&gt;
  &lt;!-- This is an example of IPA using character entities --&gt;
  &lt;!-- Because many platform/browser/text editor combinations do not
       correctly cut and paste Unicode text, this example uses the entity
       escape versions of the IPA characters.  Normally, one would directly
       use the UTF-8 representation of these symbols: &quot;təmei̥ɾou̥&quot;. --&gt;
&lt;/speak&gt;



''sub - Element''        
        an element used to specify within its “alias” attribute the pronounced version of some 
        written text that is between the tag set. Example:
	&lt;sub alias=”American Association of Retired Persons”&gt;AARP&lt;/sub&gt; 

Prosody and Style - prosody covers such things as tone, intonation, conversational pacing, pitch of voice, loudness, duration of sound, chunking (units of words, not necessarily sentences).

''voice - Element''
        indicates the type of voice to use, all the attributes are optional, however, not 
        indicating any attributes at all is considered an error. The “lang” attribute takes  
        precedence; all other attributes are equal.
	''lang - attribute'' 
                 for voice element, indicates the language for the voice.
	''gender - Attribute''
	''age - Attributte''''
	''variant - Attributte''
	''name - Attribute''

''EXAMPLE:''

&lt;voice gender=&quot;male&quot;&gt;Show me a person without a goal&lt;/voice&gt;
  &lt;!-- now request a different female child's voice --&gt;
  &lt;voice gender=&quot;male&quot; variant=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  and I'll show you a stock clerk.
  &lt;/voice&gt;
  &lt;!-- processor-specific voice selection --&gt;
  &lt;voice name=&quot;James&quot;&gt;Show me a stock clerk with a goal and I'll show you someone who will change the world.&lt;/voice&gt;


''emphasis - Element''
        contains text to be emphasized by the speech processor (with stress or intensity). It  
        has one attribute:
	''level - Attribute''
                 indicating the degree of emphasis.

''EXAMPLE:''

Geniuses themselves don't talk about the gift of genius, they just talk about 
 &lt;emphasis level=&quot;strong&quot;&gt; hard work and long hours. &lt;/emphasis&gt;


The &quot;emphasis&quot; element can contain text and the following elements:
	''audio - Element''
	''desc - Element''
                 if the content is not speech then the “desc” tag should be used to describe   
                 the content. This description can be used in a text output for the hearing   
                 impaired.
	''break - Element''
	''emphasis - Element'' 
	''mark - Element''
	''phoneme - Element''
	''prosody - Element''
	''say-as - Element''
	''sub - Element''
	''voice - Element''

''break - Element''
        wherever the element is used between words it indicates a pause in the reading of the  
        text; attributes are: “strength” with values of: none (meaning no pause even if the 
        system would normally put one there), x-weak, weak, medium, strong, x-strong; “time” 
        with values of either milliseconds: 250ms or seconds: 2s. 

''prosody - Element'' 
        controls the pitch, speaking rate and volume of a generated voice. Attributes   
        are optional but it is considered an error if no attributes are set. 
        pitch - Attribute
        contour - Attribute
        range - Attribute
        rate - Attribute
        duration - Attribute
        volume - Attribute

Other elements that allow the insertion of audio files in addition to generated voice content. 

''audio - Element'' 
        may be empty but if it contains anything it should be the text that the speech 
        generator could convert to a voice in place of the audio file. 

''EXAMPLE:''

&lt;!-- Container element with alternative text --&gt;
  &lt;audio src=&quot;JCPennyQuote.au&quot;&gt;Every business is built on friendship.&lt;/audio&gt;


''mark - Element''
        an empty tag that places a named marker into the content. When the processor  
        reaches a “mark” element one of two things happens. One, the processor is provided 
        with the info to retrieve the desired position in the content, two, an event is issued 
        that includes the content at the desired position. It has one attribute which is:
        ''name - Attribute''
                 
''desc - Element''

== Potential Future of XML Web Audio: ==

Additional tags could be introduced to contain dates, titles of files, authors, originating language and other metadata about the files. Expanding the set of existing tags would enable the files to be stored and searched in databases using multiple methods. They would enable storing of data related to the actual text/audio files that would be valuable to potential users. A user could search based on originating date of the file, the originating country of the file and subject or title of files.



== Conclusion: ==
 
Using SSML, a subset of XML, audio files can be generated from any text file such as news reports, government documents, educational materials or official records. This content could be delivered via mobile communication services and over the web. The files could be played on mobile browser devices. This could constitute a much larger market for internet radio than the strictly music or programmed content form it exists in today. This could generate many uses for on-demand access to many sources of  information for travelling users.

===Using System Preferences===
When you open System Preferences, you see the System Preferences main screen. This screen is full of icons, each representing a &quot;pane&quot;, or group of controls. System Preferences grouped into '''Personal''', '''Hardware''', '''Internet &amp; Network''', and '''System''' rows. As with all other aspects of Tiger, Spotlight is built into the top right corner of the System Preferences menu.

==The Preference Panes==
{{Stages}}
The following is a list of all of the default System Preferences panes. Each pane has a specific purpose. Usually, the name of the window gives it away, while others, such as Security, may have many different purposes.

# Personal

=Introduction=
OpenOffice.org is exactly what its title suggests:  an open source office applications suite.  It is based on the source of Sun Microsystems' StarOffice, which was donated to the open source community in 2000.  OpenOffice.org will read and save files in several formats used by other office applications, but its default format is OpenDocument, which is an XML format standardized by OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards).  Because of these two factors, an open source editor and XML-based files, OpenOffice.org is poised to be of great importance in the very near future as the trend continues for national governments, particularly in the European Union, to require that all electronic government documents be saved in an open source format.

=OpenDocument Format=
As stated in the introduction, OpenDocument is an XML format standardized by OASIS.  An OpenDocument file takes the form of a compressed zip archive with one of the following extensions:

* .odt (text)
* .ott (text template)
* .odm (master document)
* .oth (HTML template)
* .ods (spreadsheet)
* .ots (spreadsheet template)
* .odg (drawing)
* .otg (drawing template)
* .odp (presentation)
* .otp (presentation template)
* .odf (formula)
* .odb (database)
(Note that all of these extensions are version 2.0 only)


The zip archive contains the following files and directories (from OpenOffice.org Help documentation):

* The actual text of the document is stored in &lt;b&gt;content.xml&lt;/b&gt;.  By default this is a stripped-down version of the document that leaves out formatting elements such as indentation or line breaks in order to streamline saving and opening the document. 


'''content.xml Example'''
{| style=&quot;background:white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em; width: 100%;&quot;

&lt;/office:document-content&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''meta.xml'''&gt; contains the meta information of the document, which can be edited in File – Properties.  If a document is saved with a password, meta.xml will not be encrypted.

=Open Office Capabilites=

OpenOffice contains WRITER which is OpenOffice.org’s word processor. CALC is a powerful spreadsheet that has all the tools needed to calculate, analyze, summarize, and present data.
IMPRESS is a fast and powerful way to create effective multimedia presentations. DRAW will produce everything from simple diagrams to dynamic 3D illustrations and special effects. New to Version 2, BASE enables you to manipulate database data seamlessly within OpenOffice.org. It allows the creation and modification of tables, forms, queries, and reports.

=The Future of OpenDocument=
Government and business leaders alike are beginning to realize the importance of open source document formats and to act upon this realization.  In July 2005, Norway's Minister of Modernization, Morton A. Meyer, presented a plan for information technology in Norway called “eNorge—the digital leap,” in which open standards and open source are addressed.  Meyer's objectives for open standards and open source are as follows:

*Within 2009 all new ICT- and information systems in the public sector shall use open standards.
*Within 2006 a set of management/administrative standards for data and document exchange should be established.
*Within 2006 all operations in the public sector should have introduced plans for how they will use open standards, service oriented architecture and open source. 
*Within 2008 all data and document exchange in the public sector shall satisfy the management/administrative standards.
*Within 2008 all public forms shall be built on a common interface.
Also, Meyer said “Proprietary formats will no longer be acceptable in communication between citizens and government.”  


In the US, IBM's Vice President of Standards and Open Source, Bob Sutor, made the following recommendations to users in his blog as part of an “Open Document Commitment to Action”:
*Insist today that the provider of your office applications (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software) is committed to support the OASIS OpenDocument Format for Office Applications standard in their products by January 1, 2007.
*Insist today that the office applications you deploy allow users to easily set the OASIS OpenDocument standard as the default &quot;save&quot; format for your documents. That is, you should not have to go to a lot of trouble to avoid using proprietary formats.
*Get a commitment from your office applications provider to join and contribute to the OASIS OpenDocument standard technical committee.
*Ask your CIO when you will be able to use office applications that support the OASIS OpenDocument standard.
*Ask your local and federal governments when they will be supporting the OASIS OpenDocument standard.
*Insist that any XML document format you use is not encumbered by proprietary extensions, and that the format is freely available for anyone to implement without restrictions, including open source communities that use a GPL license. Ensure that if implementers must accept a license covering the format, the license is clear and unambiguous on these important issues.
*'''&quot;They are your documents: you should be able to do whatever you want with them, whenever you want, with whatever application you wish to use&quot;'''

The implications are clear.  The computing world is moving toward open source software and file types for information exchange, especially in business and government, and OpenOffice.org, with its XML-based format, stands to be at the front of the pack.

== '''History''' ==

The XMLHttpRequest object enables JavaScript to make HTTP requests to a remote server without the need to reload the page.  It was first implemented by Microsoft as an ActiveX object but is now available as a native object within both Mozilla and Apple's Safari browser.  Javascript is used to transfer information back to the server in real time where it can be processed by the server, and then returned instantaneously to the user.

== '''Purpose''' ==

The main function of the XMLHttpRequest object is that it provides an easy way for webpages to receive updated information from servers without having to refresh the whole webpage.  As a result, the webserver’s processing load is reduced and the user receives information faster without seeing any interruptions in service.


== '''Future Application''' ==

The XMLHttpRequest object has many improvements over the existing data exchange methods.  Many developers still rely on Common Gateway Interchange (CGI) for data exchange.  Since CGI has no adequate restriction about the format of data, XML usage is relatively pointless from a data exchange standpoint.  Utilizing the inherent abilities of XMLHttp will remove the inadequacies originating from the widespread use of CGI.  The XMLHttpRequest object provides a more adequate approach for real-time content delivery than existing development methods.

{{Wikibooks help}}

Wikibooks is a [[w:wiki|wiki]], and as such is designed to allow anyone to edit pages and thus contribute to the collection of textbooks here.  On popular books it is necessary to collaborate and coordinate with others.  But how can you do so if you cannot keep track of changes other editors are making?  Fortunately, Wikibooks' software makes it easy to monitor revisions to pages.  You can follow changes to [[#Recent changes|any page in the wiki]], [[#Related changes|pages linked from a particular page]], [[#Watching pages|pages in a list of your choosing]], and [[#Page history|a single page]].  You can also see [[#User contributions|changes made by a particular user]].  The software has a useful [[#Viewing diffs|interface]] for seeing what has been added and/or removed from a page.  In an environment where anyone can change pages, even those without [[Help:Account management|accounts]], vandalism can be a concern.  Wikibooks has a system where pages can be [[#Reviewing pages|reviewed]] to verify that changes by new or unregistered users are beneficial.  With all these tools at your disposal, you won't miss a thing!
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

=={{anchor|Recent Changes}}Recent changes==
{{shortcut|WB:RC}}

The '''[[Special:RecentChanges|Recent Changes]]''' page lets you see the most recent changes made to pages at Wikibooks.  Using this page, you can monitor and review the work of other users, allowing mistakes to be corrected and vandalism to be eliminated.  There is a link to the Recent Changes page in the sidebar of each page. You can also create a link to the page as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:RecentChanges]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

==={{anchor|Related Changes}}Related changes ===
The '''Related Changes''' page lets you see the most recent changes for pages linked to from the current page, or for pages that link to the current page. Using this page, you can monitor and review relates works. The parent links created by the software on a subpage do not count as page links to show changes for. There is a link to the Related Changes pages in the toolbox for most skins. You can also create a link for a page with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:RecentChangesLinked/PageName]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. All of the [[#Preferences|preferences]] and limitations that apply to Recent Changes also apply to Related Changes.

===Preferences===
Logged in users can set preferences to adjust the appearance of these pages.  For help in doing this, see [[WB:LOGIN|how to log in]] and [[WB:PREFS|how to set preferences]].  The options that affect these pages are:

* '''Days to show in recent changes''' - You may select the number of days to be shown by default on the Recent Changes page.
* '''Number of edits to show by default''' - You may select the number of changes which will be shown by default. Once on that page, links are provided for other options. In the case of Enhanced Recent Changes this number of changes includes those that are initially hidden.
* '''Use enhanced recent changes''' - with this option enabled, multiple edits are grouped together. This option uses [[JavaScript]], and won't work in every browser.
* '''Hide minor edits in recent changes''' - this hides all edits that have been marked as minor by logged in users.
* '''Hide reviewed edits in recent changes''' - this hides all edits that have been [[#Reviewing pages|reviewed]].

==={{anchor|Enhanced Recent changes}}Enhanced Recent Changes===
Enhanced Recent Changes groups recent changes per day, where &quot;day&quot; is defined according to local time. For each day, it groups the changes by page, and displays the titles of the changed pages in order from new to old latest change of the day concerned, or in the case of hiding minor edits, latest major change.

Multiple edits on the same day to a single page are grouped together on the Recent Changes screen. Only a summary line is shown, info about the individual edits is loaded into the browser right away but only shown by clicking on the blue arrow on the left. This option uses [[JavaScript]] and does not work in every browser (see [[m:Browser issues with MediaWiki|Browser issues with MediaWiki]]).

This feature applies also to [[#Related changes|Related Changes]] and the enhanced [[#Watching pages|watchlist]]. The latter is simply a selection of the enhanced Recent Changes, namely a restriction to watched pages, without the bolding.

===Appearance===
The default Recent Changes looks like this:

* ([[#Diff|diff]]) ([[#Page history|hist]]) . . '''&lt;span class=&quot;unpatrolled&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;''' [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Pterosaurs]] &lt;span style=&quot;background:#ffff00; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[#Reviewing pages|review]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; 10:06 . . &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+1,864)&lt;/span&gt; . .

Enhanced Recent Changes shows changes to one page on the same line, with an arrow next to it:

[[File:Arr_r.png|link=|alt=]] '''&lt;tt&gt;N&lt;/tt&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;10:06&lt;/tt&gt; [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Pterosaurs]] &lt;span style=&quot;background:#ffff00; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[#Reviewing pages|review]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ([[#Diff|2 changes]] | [[#Page history|hist]]) . . &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+2754)&lt;/span&gt; . . &lt;font size='-1'&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Special:contributions/111.222.33.44|111.222.33.44]]; [[User:Anthere|Anthere]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;tt&gt;N&lt;/tt&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;10:04&lt;/tt&gt; [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs]] (diff | [[#Page history|hist]]) . . &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+3394)&lt;/span&gt; . . [[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] ([[User talk:Brion VIBBER|talk]] | [[#User contributions|contribs]]) ''(New page)''&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;10:03&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Special:Log/move|Move log]]) . . [[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] ([[User talk:Maveric149|talk]] | [[#User contributions|contribs]]) moved [[Main page]] to [[Main Page]] (''better location'')

Clicking this arrow expands the entry so you can see all the changes made:

[[File:Arr_d.png|link=|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;10:06&lt;/tt&gt; [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Pterosaurs]] &lt;span style=&quot;background:#ffff00; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[#Reviewing pages|review]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ([[#Diff|2 changes]] | [[#Page history|hist]]) . . &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+2754)&lt;/span&gt; . . &lt;font size='-1'&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Special:contributions/111.222.33.44|111.222.33.44]]; [[User:Anthere|Anthere]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]] ([[User talk:Maveric149|talk]] | [[#User contributions|contribs]]) moved [[Main page]] to [[Main Page]] (''better location'')

Each indicates four edits: the first by a user who is not logged in, to [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Pterosaurs]]; the second by Anthere to [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs]]; the third by Maveric149 to [[Main page]]; and the fourth by Brion VIBBER to [[Wikijunior:Dinosaurs]].

What each element used means:
* &quot;[[#Diff|diff]]&quot; links to the diff-page for this edit; it is not available for new pages, or for page moves
* The &quot;[[#Page history|hist]]&quot; link corresponds to the ''Page history'' link on the edited page: it shows not just this edit but also older and newer ones. For page moves, the hist link leads to the history of the new page title
* A bold '''m''' indicates that the user marked the edit &quot;minor&quot;. Only logged in users can mark edits minor, to avoid abuse.
* A bold '''N''' indicates that the page is &quot;new&quot;, i.e., previously did not exist.  It is possible for a change to possess both the &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;new&quot; indicators; this is typically used for new [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|redirect]]s.
* A bold '''b''' indicates that the edit is made by a bot (an account with bot flag), or that the edit is hidden by an administrator.
* A bold '''&lt;span class=&quot;unpatrolled&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;''' indicates that the page is unreviewed.  For more information see  ''[[#Reviewing pages|Reviewing pages]]'' below.
* The next link is a link to the current version of the page in question.
** A bold '''[[Help:Editing#Links|link]]''' indicates this page is part of your [[#Watching pages|watchlist]].
* The &lt;span style=&quot;background:#ffff00; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[#Reviewing pages|review]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tag next to the page title will take you to a page that shows the [[#Diff|diff]] between the last [[#Reviewing pages|reviewed]] edit to the page and the most recent edit.
* 10:06 refers to the time in [[w:UTC|UTC]]. You can change the time to your time zone using your preferences - see [[WB:PREFS|how to set preferences]].
* &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+1,864)&lt;/span&gt; (generally a green number with a +, or a red number with a -) refers to the number of bytes that have been added or removed.
* For [[WB:LOGIN|logged in]] users, the next link is a link to their user homepage (as usual with internal links, the view page if the page exists, the edit page if it does not, the two being styled differently). For users who are not logged in, the link is to their ''[[#User contributions|user contributions]]''.
* There is a link to the user's talk page (the same remarks regarding existence apply).
* Finally, there is a link to the user's contributions if the user is logged in.
* For page moves, a link is given to both the old and new title.

==Watching pages==
{{shortcut|WB:WATCH|WB:WATCHLIST}}

'''Watching pages'''  allows any [[WB:LOGIN|logged-in]] user to keep a list of &quot;watched&quot; pages and to generate a list of recent changes made to those pages (and their associated talk pages). In this way you can keep track of and react to what's happening to pages you have created or are otherwise interested in.

===Controlling which pages are watched===
[[File:Unwatched page in Vector.png|thumb|300px|This screenshot shows a page that is not on the watchlist of the user. Clicking on the star will add it to the watchlist.]]
[[File:Watched page in Vector.png|thumb|300px|The star on this page is blue to indicate that it is on the watchlist of the user.]]
There are four ways to control which pages you have on your watchlist:
#When viewing a page, click the star sign between the 'View history' tab and the search box at the very top of the page (for the default appearance, in some other versions, click on the &quot;watch&quot; or &quot;unwatch&quot; tab), to respectively add or remove the page from your watchlist.
#When editing a page, check or uncheck &quot;Watch this page&quot; before saving (above the ''[[Help:Editing#Show preview button|Show preview]]'' button).
#Click &quot;View and edit watchlist&quot; or &quot;Edit raw watchlist&quot; at the top of the watchlist page to view or alter the list of watched pages directly. The first option takes you to [[Special:Watchlist/edit]], where the watched pages are listed with checkboxes which can be used to remove items. The second takes you to [[Special:Watchlist/raw]], which has a text area with a list of watched pages, one title per line, sorted by [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespace]] number and then alphabetically. You can edit the list directly, copy it to an external editor or replace it with a list created elsewhere. Duplicates are automatically removed on saving.

If you check &quot;Add pages I [[Help:Editing|edit]] to my watchlist&quot; on the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab of your user [[WB:PREFS|preferences]], then the &quot;Watch this page&quot; checkbox will always be checked by default when you edit pages. Other similar options are &quot;Add pages I create to my watchlist&quot;, &quot;Add pages I [[WB:MOVE|move]] to my watchlist&quot;, &quot;Add pages I [[#Reviewing pages|review]] to my watchlist&quot;, and (for [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]]) &quot;Add pages I delete to my watchlist&quot;.

It should also be noted that:
*Talk pages are not listed at [[Special:Watchlist/edit]] or [[Special:Watchlist/raw]], but they are automatically watched whenever their corresponding non-talk pages are watched.
*It is not possible to watch automatically generated pages, such as [[Special:SpecialPages|Special pages]]. Watching a [[Help:Categories|category]] page will pick up changes to the text of the category page itself, but not to the lists of subcategories and pages contained in the category. Similarly, watching an [[Help:Files|file]] will not detect uploads of new versions of the file.
*Additional page titles may sometimes appear on your watchlist as a result of page moves (see [[#Moves, creations and deletions|Moves, creations, and deletions]] below).
*When a watched page contains transcluded text, such as [[Help:Templates|templates]], the form of the page may change as a result of changes to the transcluded pages. These changes will not show up on your watchlist unless you are watching the transcluded pages as well.

===How to read a watchlist===
When you are [[WB:LOGIN|logged in]] to Wikibooks, a link, &lt;code&gt;my watchlist&lt;/code&gt; appears at the top of every page.
This links to the special page [[Special:Watchlist]], reporting recent changes to your watched pages.  It is a list separated by days, ordered backwards according to the time of the edit. 

Each line shows details of each edit: whether [[Help:Editing#Minor edit|minor]] ('''m'''), whether made by a [[Wikibooks:Bots|bot]] ('''b'''), the time, a link to the page, a link to the difference (&quot;[[#Diff|diff]]&quot;) made by the edit in question, a link to the page history (&quot;[[#Page history|hist]]&quot;), the editor's user name or IP address, the increase (green) or decrease (red) in the number of [[w:bytes|bytes]], e.g. &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+76)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class='mw-plusminus-neg'&gt;(-490)&lt;/span&gt; or, if over 500, in bold: &lt;strong class='mw-plusminus-pos'&gt;(+794)&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class='mw-plusminus-neg'&gt;(-2,412)&lt;/strong&gt;, and the [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|edit summary]].  Technically, the watchlist is just another way to filter [[#Recent changes|recent changes]].

===Options===
There are various options available to control how the list of changes is displayed:
*You may choose to hide or show minor edits, bot edits, one's own edits, edits by anonymous users, and edits by logged-in users (links for this purpose appear at the top of the watchlist page). Initially the default behavior for all of these is &quot;show&quot;; this can be changed using the options available on the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab of your user preferences.
*You can choose how many hours or days you want the list of changes to go back, using the links at the top of the watchlist. For the maximum (30 days), select &quot;all&quot;. For non-standard values, select one of the available links and then edit the value after &quot;days=&quot; in the [[w:URL|URL]]. The default value, which must be a number of days not greater than 7, is set on the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab of user preferences. Note that there may be a later cut-off due to the limit on the number of displayed changes, described below.  
*You can restrict the list to changes in a specified [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespace]], using the &quot;Namespace&quot; drop-down box (check &quot;Invert selection&quot; to ''exclude'' the specified namespace).
*You can elect to display only the last edit to each watched page (&quot;Simple watchlist&quot;). This is currently the default, but can produce misleading results (for example, if the last edit to a page was minor, then there is no indication that a previous non-minor edit occurred). ''To ensure that all changes are displayed, check the &quot;Expand watchlist...&quot; option on the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab of your user preferences.''
*Having selected the expanded watchlist, you can choose &quot;[[#Enhanced recent changes|enhanced]]&quot; display mode, which groups together all changes made to each page on a given day. Click on the blue arrows to the left of the list to expand or collapse each group. This option applies to both the watchlist and recent changes, and for this reason appears on the &quot;Recent changes&quot; tab of user preferences, not the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab.
*You may choose to set the &quot;Maximum number of changes to show in expanded watchlist&quot; (on the &quot;Watchlist&quot; tab of user preferences). The maximum possible number of changes to display is currently 1000. If this causes a later time cutoff than you desired, you can see earlier changes by filtering by type or namespace, as described above.

===Effects of watching a page===
When you view [[#Recent changes|Recent Changes]], [[#Enhanced recent changes|Enhanced Recent Changes]] or [[#Related changes|Related Changes]], entries relating to pages you are watching appear '''bolded'''. This means that it may be beneficial to mark pages as &quot;watched&quot; even if you do not intend viewing the [[Special:Watchlist]] page.

===Moves, creations, and deletions===
Actions affecting watched pages (page [[WB:MOVE|moves]], page [[WB:CREATE|creations]] and [[WB:DEL|deletions]], [[Help:Editing#Protected pages|protection]]) also appear in the watchlist. For example, if you watch a page that does not yet have a talk page, you will see on your watchlist when someone creates that talk page. 

You can watch a page even if neither the content page nor the talk page exists. To do that, go to the page's URL, either by typing the URL directly or following a (broken) link, and then press the watch button.

If a page you have watched is moved to a new title, the new title will be automatically added to your watchlist.  Even if the page is later moved back (and even if the page at the new title is deleted), the new title will remain in your watchlist along with the old one. If you notice mysterious nonexistent pages appearing on your watchlist, this is the most likely explanation.

===Alternatives to watchlists===
An account can have only one watchlist. However, it is possible to set up watchlist-like functionality using the &quot;[[#Related changes|Related changes]]&quot; feature, in a way that effectively enables a user to achieve multiple watchlists. To do this, create a page (normally in your own [[Wikibooks:User pages|user space]]) containing links to the pages you wish to watch. Changes to those pages can then be monitored by going to the user page and clicking &quot;Related changes&quot;. Note that in this case the talk pages corresponding to &quot;watched&quot; pages are ''not'' automatically included, and that changes to the user page itself will not be picked up.

Related Changes can also be used to monitor changes to pages belonging to a [[Help:Categories|category]], including the addition of pages to the category (which is not picked up by placing the category on a watchlist). However, the removal of pages from the category is ''not'' detected.

==Page history==
{{shortcut|WB:PH}}

Every editable page on Wikibooks has an associated '''page history''' (sometimes called '''revision history''' or '''edit history'''), which is accessed by clicking the &quot;history&quot; tab at the top of the page. The page history contains a list of the page's previous revisions, including the date and time (in [[w:UTC|UTC]]) of each edit, the username or IP address of the user who made it, and their [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|edit summary]]. 

=== Using a history page ===
On a history page:
*All past changes to the page in question are listed in reverse-chronological order. 
*To view a specific version, click a date.
*To compare an old version with the current version, click '''cur'''.
*To compare a version with its predecessor, click '''prev'''.
*To compare two specific versions, tick the left-column radio button of the older version and the right-column radio button of the newer version, and then click the &quot;Compare selected versions&quot; button.
*[[Help:Editing#Minor edit|Minor edits]] are denoted as '''m'''.

Below is a detailed example of a page history using the default skin:

[[File:Screenshot page history.png|900px]]

Edits are shown from newest to oldest. Each edit takes up one line which shows; time &amp; date, the contributor's name or IP and the [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|edit summary]], as well as other diagnostic information.
Let's look at some of the functions of this page:
# &quot;Revision history of&quot; is added to the page name and the &quot;View History&quot; tab is highlighted.
# These links take you to the most recent edits ''(Latest)'', oldest edits ''(Earliest)'' or the next or previous page of edits ''(Next n / Previous n)''. Note that the black text in parentheses will become links, when applicable.
# The blue numbers list the number of edits displayed on a page - 20, 50, 100, 250 or 500. A higher number increases the length of a page but reduces the number of pages The number you select replaces ''n'' in the links to the previous or next pages e.g. ''(Next 100 / Previous 100)''.
# ''(cur)'' takes you to a [[#Diff|diff]] page, showing the difference between that edit and the current version. The current revision appears below the changes, so you can see how the page is now rendered.
# ''(prev)'' takes you to a diff page showing the changes between that edit and the previous version. The most recent version (the one on the same line as the &quot;last&quot; you clicked on) appears below the changes, so you can see how the page was rendered.
# The two columns of [[w:radio button|radio buttons]] can be used to select any two versions on the page. The current selection is marked by a special background. The two most recent versions are selected by default when you first view the history (that is why they appear framed and have a different background, see horizontal area around 4 and 6). Let's say you want to compare the versions corresponding to numbers 10 &amp; 11 on the image. First, click the left radio button next to number 11. The right column of buttons will then fill as far as number 11. Then click the right button next to number 10. Finally click ''Compare selected versions''. This takes you to a diff page showing the changes between the two versions. The most recent version (in this case number 10) appears below the changes, so you can see how the page was rendered.
# This gives the time and date of the edit, expressed in local time according to the preference setting. The date and time link to the version of that day and time. Thus the  first line links to the version that was current at the time of loading this revision history, and therefore the result may differ from that of following the link on the page margin to the current version. Even if the page has not changed in the meantime, the [[MediaWiki:Revision-info|Revision-info message]] appears.
# The username or IP  of the contributor appears here.
# This is the edit summary. It is the text the user wrote in the edit summary box (below the edit box).
# This edit summary begins with an arrow link and grey text. This means the user has only edited a section of the page (named in the grey text). This text is automatically added when you edit a section. A standard edit summary can be added by the user. This appears in black text.
# '''m''' stands for minor edit.

It is possible to restore an old version of a page by following the link to that version, clicking &quot;edit&quot; and then saving. This should be done with caution, as it means that ''all'' changes made to the page since the time of that version will be lost.

In rare cases all or part of a page history entry may be shown in grey, struck out by a horizontal line. This indicates that information has been hidden from public view by an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]].

===Moved and deleted pages===
When a page is [[WB:MOVE|moved]] (renamed), the entire edit history of the page, before and after the move, is shown. The old title becomes a [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]] and loses its edit history. 

If instead of a move, the entire content was [[w:cut and paste|cut and paste]]d into a new substitute page, the page history gets spread across two pages. The histories can be merged in this case.

When two pages are merged, typically one becomes a redirect. In this case the revision history of the redirect is kept.

When a page is deleted, its revision history remains in the database and can be retrieved by an administrator, who can also undelete the page.

Administrators can also remove selected revisions from a page history, for example if they contain defamatory text.

===Files===
A file can be edited, or, more generally, be replaced by a different file, by uploading a new file with the same name. Again, all versions are kept. The file's history listing forms part of the [[Help:Files#File page|description page]], which appears when clicking on the file. The file's history consists of this and the old versions themselves.

===Linking to a specific version===
It is sometimes useful to link to a specific version of a page (a snapshot of it). For example, one might have done a [[#Reviewing pages|review]] of a Wikibooks page and want to indicate which particular version was reviewed. 

If the version is not the current version, one can use the page history to view the old version of the page. The URL of this old version is suitable for use to permanently reference this version, and can usually be obtained from the browser's location bar.

However if a page contains transcluded text (such as a [[Help:Templates|template]]), or a time-based [[Help:Variables|variable]] (such as &lt;nowiki&gt;CURRENTTIME&lt;/nowiki&gt;), it will be rendered according to the current state of the template or the time now, possibly producing a different result than was rendered at the time the old version was saved.

==User contributions==
{{shortcut|WB:CONTRIBS}}

'''User contributions pages''' are automatically generated pages that list the edits that a particular user has made.

You can check your own contributions to refresh your memory about which pages you have worked on (and to easily access these again), and also to find out whether there have been any subsequent edits (see [[#Page history|page history]]). This can be a useful quick alternative to accessing your [[#Watching pages|watchlist]], particularly if your watchlist contains a large number of pages. Other users' user contribution pages can also be accessed and are useful for seeing how other users have contributed. They can be used to track down [[Wikibooks:Vandalism|vandalism]], serial [[WB:COPYVIO|copyright violations]], etc.

===Accessing a user contributions page===
To access your own user contributions page, click &quot;my contributions&quot; at the top of the page, or visit [[Special:MyContributions]].

To access the contributions of a [[WB:LOGIN|logged-in]] user (named account), go to the user page (User:XXX) and click on &quot;User contributions&quot; listed under the &quot;Toolbox&quot; menu on the left-hand side of the screen. This works even if the user page has not been created yet (i.e. an edit box displays).

To access the contributions of an anonymous user (identified by [[w:IP address|IP address]]), use one of the following methods:
* Click on the IP address where it appears on your [[#Watching pages|watchlist]], in [[#Recent changes|Recent changes]] or in [[#Page history|Page history]].
* Put the IP address in the search box and press Enter on your keyboard.
*If the user is currently [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy|blocked]], a notice will be displayed at the very top of the contributions screen [[Special:Contributions/Willy on Wheels!|like this example]].

Bear in mind that a public IP address may have been used by different users at different times. (And conversely, that a given user may have used multiple IP addresses and/or usernames.)

===Appearance of a user contributions page===
Below is an example of a user contributions page:

[[File:User contributions en-wikibooks.png|Example of a user contributions page]]

# The username or IP of the contributor
# A search form, allowing you to search by username, IP address (or range), date, or [[Help:Pages#Namespaces|namespace]] (such as ''Template''). IP range search uses a [[w:wildcard character|wildcard]] asterisk, such as ''10.11.12.*'' or ''192.168.*''. This requires you are logged in and check &quot;Allow /16 and /24 – /32 CIDR ranges on Special:Contributions forms (uses API), as well as wildcard prefix searches&quot; under Gadgets in [[Special:Preferences]].
# A list of edits, shown from newest to oldest. Each edit takes up one line which contains:
# The time and date of the edit, displayed in your preferred format.
# ''(hist)'' takes you to the [[#Page history|page history]], so you can see all edits made to that page. This can be useful if someone has updated a page you have worked on, and you want to see their changes.
# ''(diff)'' takes you to a [[#Diff|diff]] page showing the changes between that edit and the previous revision. The revision after the edit appears below the changes so you can see the result of the edit.
# '''m''' indicates a [[Help:Editing#Minor edit|minor edit]]; '''N''' indicates a new page.
# The current name of the page that was edited.
# The [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|edit summary]], a description written by the editor (or generated automatically, in certain cases). If a summary begins with an arrow link and grey text, the user has only edited the stated [[Help:Editing#Section|section]] of the page. Wikibooks automatically adds this when you edit a section.
# '''(top)''' signifies that the edit is the current revision. The page is as the user last saved it. This can be used to watch pages (if your last edit to the page does not display '''(top)''', the page has been changed).
# If an editor has made more edits than will fit on one page, this line provides links to the most recent edits ''(latest)'', oldest edits ''(earliest)'' or the next or previous page of edits ''(newer n / older n)''.
# The blue numbers list the number of edits displayed on a page: 20, 50, 100, 250 or 500. The number you select replaces ''n'' in the links to the previous or next pages e.g. ''(newer 100 / older 100)''. Views of up to 5000 edits per page are possible by modifying the URL.

[[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] and other users with special tools may have additional options on contributions pages.

The following information normally does not appear:
* Edits from a page that has been deleted afterwards (unless the page, including the revision concerned, has been restored).
* Uploading of a new file with the same name as one that already exists, thus replacing it
* Deletion or restoration (undeletion) of a page (if the user is an administrator). Use [[Special:Logs]] or click &quot;Logs&quot; on the user contributions page for viewing these actions.

=={{anchor|Diff|Diffs}}Viewing diffs==
{{shortcut|WB:DIFF}}

A '''diff''' is a page or panel showing the difference between two versions of the wikitext of an editable page.

Links to the diffs corresponding to specific edits appear in various lists, including [[#Page history|page histories]], a user's [[#User contributions|contributions]], [[#Recent changes|Recent Changes]], [[#Related changes|Related Changes]], and [[#Watching pages|watchlists]]. There may also be links to the diffs between the specified version and the current (last) version. In page histories it is possible to generate a diff between ''any'' two versions – select the left [[w:radio button|radio button]] for the older version, the right radio button for the newer version, and click ''Compare selected versions''.

Diffs can also be displayed while editing a page, via the ''Show changes'' button, to see clearly what changes you are about to make. The diff is also shown during an [[Help:Editing#Edit conflict|edit conflict]], so you can see exactly what you need to reintegrate.

===Appearance of diffs===
This example shows the top of the diff page (some of the links are dummies). The older version is shown on the left, the newer version on the right.

==== Explanation of colors ====
Unchanged text is black on grey (only parts before and after changed text are shown). Paragraphs which have changed are highlighted in yellow on the old version side, and green on the new version side. Where whole paragraphs have been removed or inserted, the other side is blank (white). Removed text is shown in red on the old version. New text is shown in red on the new version.

==== Controls and links ====
The links &quot;Revision as of ''date''&quot; link to each version. If the newer version is the latest one, the link will be to the usual page and the wording will be &quot;Current revision (''date'')&quot; instead.  For administrators and [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]], a  revision with &quot;[checked revision]&quot; above it has been [[#Reviewing pages|reviewed]] while a revision with &quot;[pending revision]&quot; above it has not yet been reviewed.  Revisions with &quot;[unreviewed revision]&quot; above them occur on a page where no revision at all has been reviewed.

The &quot;(edit)&quot; link will take you to the page for editing that version. You may be warned that you are editing an out-of-date revision; if you ignore this and continue, you will revert all the edits made since after that revision. 

The &quot;(undo)&quot; link on the newer revision's side will [[Help:Editing#Reverting|revert]] that specific edit. When you click the link you can check the diff page of the edit you are going to make, and the [[Help:Editing#Edit summary|edit summary]] will be automatically filled in with the phrase of [[MediaWiki:undo-summary]] ({{MediaWiki:undo-summary}}). This summary can be edited before you submit your edit. When you are undoing several edits at once, the auto-summary may not work. Though the link exists on all diff pages, it does not function when the revisions conflict. Often versions older than the current one cannot be undone in this way. If it does not work, you will be told that the edit could not be undone and end up in the regular editing page of the current version.

Below that are links to the user page and talk page of the each user who edited the older or the newer versions. Links to the users' contribution lists are also shown. For administrators and [[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]], a &quot;[rollback]&quot; button also appears where applicable, allowing them to revert all of the edits made by that user.

Then the [[WB:ES|edit summaries]] are shown in a parenthesis. If the user has used links in their edit summary, these act as links on the diff page as well. If the editor marked the edit as an [[WB:MINOR|minor edit]], &lt;span class=&quot;minor&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; appears before the summary.

The &quot;Previous edit&quot; and &quot;Next edit&quot; links lead to earlier or later diffs. When you are viewing the diff between two non-consecutive versions of a page, you will also see the message &quot;(x intermediate revisions not shown.)&quot;.

After the table of differences, the latest of the two compared versions is shown fully, unless you have specified in your preferences that this is not to be done.

===Linking to a diff===
If you need to create a link to a specific diff (for use on a talk page or noticeboard, for example), then locate the diff from the [[#Page history|page history]], go to the diff page, and copy the [[w:URL|URL]] from your browser's address bar. Then paste this URL (the whole of it, including &lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;) into the text of the page where you want the link to appear, putting single square brackets [...] around it.

The URL for a diff is based on the &lt;code&gt;oldid&lt;/code&gt; value of the old revision. If a revision has oldid value 12345678, so its URL is:

*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=PAGETITLE&amp;oldid=12345678&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

then URLs for its diffs may take the forms:

*diff with the current version: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=PAGETITLE&amp;diff=cur&amp;oldid=123456789&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*diff with the previous version: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=PAGETITLE&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=123456789&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*diff with version 10000001: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=PAGETITLE&amp;diff=100000001&amp;oldid=123456789&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Another way of creating links to diffs is described at [[Template:Diff]].

==Reviewing pages==
{{shortcut|WB:REVIEW|WB:FR}}

The ''pending changes'' system (also known as ''edit review'' and ''flagged revisions'') allows ''[[Wikibooks:Reviewers|reviewers]]'' to review page revisions for quality. This is our primary counter-vandalism tool.

This feature allows readers who log in to manage the revision they are served, using their [[WB:PREFS|preferences]]. Except for the Wikijunior namespace, by default the latest version of a page, reviewed or not, is shown to readers. In the Wikijunior namespace, by default readers are served only the last reviewed version of a page (if there is a reviewed version, otherwise the latest unreviewed version; but on Wikijunior we try to be sure there is a reviewed version). [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] are able to change the settings for pages so that the latest reviewed version of a page is shown by default to logged-out readers.  This is used primarily for [[Wikijunior]] books but any book can opt-in to this.  Regardless of what version is initially shown, in cases where there are pending unreviewed changes to a page, there will be tabs titled ''Read'' and ''Latest draft'' to switch between the latest reviewed version and the most recent edit.

Regular contributors are automatically given reviewer status by the software. Reviewers automatically review pages at the lowest setting (called ''checking a page'') when they save, so active books will usually have contributions by non-reviewers reviewed shortly after they are committed.

As a non-enforceable but documented bit of culture, reviewers are discouraged from reviewing pages in books at the &quot;good level&quot; (called ''approving a page'') if the book contributors do not want to take part in having their pages reviewed.  The good level may be useful as a matter of internal review by the book contributors, or an external review such as in a request to have the book be [[Wikibooks:Good books|featured]], etc.

=== Quality criteria and levels ===
A page can be reviewed based on its quality. The default rating is the lowest level: &quot;'''poor/unrated'''&quot;. The following lines describe the rest of the levels.

*'''minimal''' - Proofread for spelling, punctuation, grammar, paragraph structure, and paragraph consistency.
*'''average''' - Checked that typography and language is consistent with the book's [[Help:Local manuals of style|local manual of style]].
*'''good''' - Thoroughly examined to ensure ideas/concepts are consistent, neutral, accurate and verifiable.

If most of the pages in a book have a revision that has been flagged as being of good quality, the book may be a good candidate to be nominated as a [[WB:FB|featured book]].

===Monitoring reviewing===
There are two logs of page reviews:
* The [[Special:Log/review|basic review log]] lets you filter by ''user'', ''title'' and ''date''.
* The [[Special:AdvancedReviewLog|advanced review log]] lets you filter by ''namespace'', ''status'', ''action'', and ''type''.

Other related special pages:
* [[Special:ValidationStatistics|Page review statistics]]
* [[Special:ReviewedPages|Reviewed pages]]
* [[Special:OldReviewedPages|Outdated reviewed pages]]
* [[Special:UnreviewedPages|Unreviewed pages]] (reviewers/administrators only)
* [[Special:ConfiguredPages|Pages with review configurations]]

===Edit review interface===
A user can configure whether the interface for indicating a page's review status is detailed or minimal in [[Special:Preferences]], influencing the way pages at Wikibooks appear.
